Each year, approximately 200,000 Americans aged 65 and older seek medical care for traumatic brain injuries
(TBI), primarily from closed head injuries (CHI) from falls. Research shows that an individual suffering one TBI
is at heightened risk for experiencing another. The ramifications extend beyond the immediate physical
consequences: TBIs have been linked to an increased risk for all types of dementia, and repetitive TBIs have
been correlated with the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau), which is a defining feature of
chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Our research and numerous other studies confirm the presence of
elevated p-tau levels in the aftermath of a TBI. However, the precise mechanisms contributing to these
changes are not fully understood. As we confront the complexities of these injuries and their long-term impact,
it becomes crucial to identify the underlying mechanisms that promote these tau-related pathological changes.
Doing so could pave the way for targeted therapeutic interventions following a TBI, reducing the risk of
developing Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. This study aims to examine the role of transforming
growth factor-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) in tau pathology following a repetitive mild TBI in a humanized MAPT
KI mouse model with the P301L risk variant of neuronal tauopathy. We found activated (phosphorylated) TAK1
kinase (pTAK1) in neurons exhibiting substantial tau pathology in both Alzheimer’s disease and CTE brains,
and developed a novel small molecule therapeutic, BNC-1, that shows promising reductions in TAK1
activation, and p-tau accumulation in mouse models of tau pathology and wildtype mice with a CHI. Our goal is
to determine an optimal BNC-1 dosage and treatment regimen that significantly reduces TAK1 phosphorylation
(Aim 1) and an analysis of the ensuing tau pathology, neuron degeneration, and behavioral impairments (Aim
2). Given the high prevalence of TBI in older adults, the therapeutic advancement of BNC-1 could significantly
reduce the burden of TBI-induced cognitive impairments and risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias. Establishing the dose-response relationship and the optimal treatment schedule of BNC-1 is crucial
data for a preclinical R01 to validate target engagement, understand the mechanism of action, and conduct
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) testing of BNC-1. If supported by data, our mid-term objective
is to advance BNC-1 toward clinical research evaluation for TBI, Alzheimer’s disease, and other tauopathies."

overutilization contributes to reduced care quality and adverse complications including iatrogenic anemia.
Multiple medical societies have highlighted the urgent need to address this problem, but the vast majority of
interventions in the literature are quality-improvement initiatives with poor generalizability. The literature is even
sparser in the highly vulnerable pediatric population, who are more susceptible to iatrogenic anemia given their
smaller blood volumes than adult patients. With the rapid expansion of electronic health records (EHRs) and
the development of massive clinical databases, machine learning (ML) has become a promising tool that can
address the problem of laboratory overutilization. While few models have been developed to predict laboratory
results in adults, among pediatric patients model development is extremely limited. Furthermore, very few
predictive ML models in any clinical domain are translated into usable clinical decision support (CDS). Despite
strong recommendations from nearly all best practice informatics resources, most CDS implementations rely
on “out-of-box” deployment rather than employing user-centered design principles. This can leave
burdensome, sometimes harmful systems in place without demonstrated effectiveness.
 This staged-award proposal will leverage the PICU Data Collaborative (PDC), a multicenter
collaboration of pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) across the United States, to develop ML-based CDS to
predict future laboratory values for the purpose of reducing laboratory overutilization. In the R21 phase, ML
models will be trained on 188,000+ unique PICU patient encounters in the PDC database to forecast future
laboratory values (Aim 1). Concurrently, guided by the Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability
Model (PRISM) framework, contextual factors will be identified to inform an ML-based CDS implementation
within the PICU sociotechnical environment. In the R33 phase, new a priori identified features will be
incorporated to enhance the ML models developed in Aim 1. These retrained models will be silently evaluated
on prospective data from selected PDC sites. In Aim 4, an EHR-embedded CDS tool will be designed for a
selected PDC site, incorporating user-centered design principles informed by the results of Aim 2. The final ML
model from Aim 3 will then be deployed in a pilot study at the single site, where we will measure the
implementation outcomes of reach and adoption.
 The result of this work will establish a useful, usable CDS tool to reduce laboratory overutilization based
on multicenter data and framed in the PICU contextual environment. Our pilot deployment will establish the
groundwork for a future effectiveness-implementation hybrid multicenter trial. These processes will be
generalizable and serve as a blueprint for developing data-driven translational decision support tools that can
be adapted to a variety of diverse healthcare settings and subsequently reduce disparities."
10949636,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human salivary gland organoid (SGO) are promising in vitro models for drug discovery, disease modeling,
regenerative therapy. However, the vast majority of organoid derivation protocols rely on ill-defined Matrigel with
tumorigenic origin and immunogenic risks, preventing their translational applications. The dependence of
organoid assembly on self-organization capacity of pluripotent stem cells is another major limitation, leading to
heterogeneous organoids due to stochastic self-assembly. Shifting SGO derivations from stochastic to
deterministic remains a challenge due to lack of information on the regulatory factors dictating pluripotent stem
cells fate during early embryonic development. Such cues – arise from complex cell-cell and cell-extracellular
matrix (ECM) interactions – change spatially and temporally during developmental stages to guide
stem/progenitor cells differentiation, self-organization, and tissue morphogenesis, making in vitro recapitulation
using engineered synthetic matrices is difficult. Indeed, salivary gland embryonic development is a highly
regulated multistage process, starting from pluripotent embryonic precursors, to germ-layer specification, then
to lineage-restricted proximal and distal epithelial progenitors, which specializes to form epithelial compartments
of ductal and acinar cells. Here, we propose development of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived
SGO with secretory function and well-defined architecture, and revealing the regulatory factors affecting salivary
gland epithelial progenitor (SGEP) colony growth, differentiation, and branching morphogenesis. To achieve this
goal, programmable differentiation of human iPSCs into SGEPs will be conducted. Afterwards, engineered
dynamic hydrogels with fine-tuned physicochemical and biological properties will be utilized to probe the SGEPs
colony response to matrix stiffness, stress-relaxation, degradability, and bioactivity (Aim 1). The information will
be used in a feedback loop to optimize the hydrogel properties for generation of functional SGO, and thus
avoiding the immunogenic risk of the commonly used Matrigel. Furthermore, photoactive hydrogel will be
employed to enable on-demand modulation of matrix mechanics, to enable colony expansion at early stage and
controlled symmetry breaking (onset of morphogenesis) at later stage, thereby generating reproducible SGO for
translational applications (Aim 2). Finally, the secretory function of the SGO will be validated in a preclinical
mouse model of hyposalivation (Aim 3). Overall, the proposed project marks as a conceptual advance in
development of SGO using innovative viscoelastic matrices."

Peripheral neuropathies can result from inherited mutations, traumatic events, toxin exposures or be idiopathic,
and are commonly affecting more severely older people. While the peripheral nervous system has the intrinsic
capacity to regenerate, its regenerative properties decline severely during normal aging. Notably, age-
associated loss of Schwann cells plasticity, the glial cells of the peripheral nervous system that support axonal
regeneration and remyelination, was demonstrated in aging mouse models. However, once the aged Schwann
cells go pass this delay it is unclear if the impaired remyelination result from aged Schwann cells intrinsic
impairments in reengaging and remyelinating demyelinated axons. We hypothesized that aged Schwann cell
remyelination capacity is impaired due to intrinsic defects in recognizing remyelination axonal signals, limiting
nerve recovery, which constitute a new path of investigation in nerve repair during aging.
We have developed an in-vitro system, the pseudopod assay, designed to isolate Schwann cell pseudopod
formed in response to a suspension of neuronal cell membranes. This approach was proven to be effective at
identifying numerous molecules and signaling pathways essential for the initial interaction between Schwann cell
and axon during development. However, the molecules and potential remyelination signaling pathways present
at the axon-Schwann cell interface when Schwann re-engage and remyelinate demyelinated axons are unclear,
and how aging is altering those molecular events are unknown. Thus, we expand our pseudopod assay to identify
molecules and pathways altered during axon-Schwann cell interaction between aged and young Schwann cells.
To achieve this goal, we will (i) establish the proteomic profile of pseudopods generated by aged Schwann cells
when initiating contact with demyelinated axons, and (ii) compare the proteome generated by young Schwann
cells vs aged Schwann cells failing to reengage and remyelinate axons. We predict our results will create a
powerful new molecular dataset for the aging and neuroscience research community to use for future
investigation aiming at modulating juxtracrine axon-glia interaction in aged individuals."

10947592,"Project Summary
Our long-term goal is to understand the immunobiology of cancer and identify the molecular drivers that
promote the metastatic progression of cancer. We discovered that a potent chemokine, CCL24, is
expressed explicitly by aggressive estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cells. Our preliminary data
validated that the expression of CCL24 is significantly higher in breast cancer and that high CCL24
mRNA levels in aggressive breast cancer is associated with poor prognosis. Permutation studies
revealed that siRNA-mediated knockdown of CCL24 in overexpressing breast cancer cells promoted
mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). CCL24 may promote cancer cell EMT and metastasis as a
known chemoattractant for immunosuppressor cells to further suppress antitumor immunity. Therefore,
we hypothesize that the chemokine ligand CCL24 drives invasive features of breast cancer cells
leading to metastasis. Our specific aims are: 1) to determine the clinical significance of CCL24 in
breast cancer and its induction of EMT and unfavorable clinical outcomes; and 2) to determine the
oncogenic function of CCL24 and therapeutic targeting of CCL24 in breast cancer. In parallel, we will
determine if CCL24 contributes to breast cancer metastasis by promoting the infiltration of
immunosuppressive cells at the breast tumor site. This innovative concept explores previously unknown
roles for CCL24 as a driver of metastatic progression of aggressive breast cancer. We expect to provide
preclinical proof-of-concept of oncogenic function and therapeutic targeting of CCL24 in breast cancer."

Nicole Prince, PhD is a biochemist with expertise in applying molecular epidemiology analytic approaches to
understand complex diseases. Her overarching career goal is to become an independent researcher with a skill
set across multiple ‘omics to improve understanding of the biological determinants underlying respiratory
infection risk, one of the leading causes of mortality in children <5 years (YR) of age. The proposed research
plan leverages her background in biochemistry and analytical chemistry with new training in immunology,
respiratory medicine, and multi-omic methods, to enhance her ability to study the complex, heterogeneous
environment that underlies infection susceptibility during the first few years of life. Evidence suggests there are
genetic and epidemiological drivers of susceptibility across different subsets of children, but these cannot fully
explain the observed inter-individual variability in respiratory infection risk; and, the hypothesis of this proposal
is that subsets of children with distinct infection risk are best captured through the proteome, which
represents the composite inflammatory profile critical to infection response. This will be explored in a cohort of
children with existing proteomic and metabolomic data and extensive longitudinal follow-up through age 10 YR,
originally enrolled in the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART). (Aim 1) Proteomic profiling
will be used as input to derive inflammatory subtypes (i.e.,“inflamma-types”) at age 1 YR using a discovery
and validation approach; then, a high risk inflamma-type for respiratory infections will be identified. (Aim 2)
Inflamma-types will be recapitulated at age 6 YR to investigate their stability across the spectrum of
respiratory maturation and immune development. Finally, (Aim 3) inflamma-types will be characterized
biochemically to identify key metabolites and key pathways through the metabolome and assess their
roles as mediators in subsequent disease development (i.e., asthma). This innovative research plan utilizes
novel methodologies and will represent the first study to derive proteomic-driven subtypes to understand
respiratory infection risk. An accompanying training plan is designed to provide Dr. Prince support in completing
these research aims successfully and facilitate her transition to independence. These findings will provide critical
preliminary data to submit subsequent R01 applications to externally validate inflamma-types and assess their
clinical utility. Dr. Prince has four career goals that build upon her existing reputation as a biochemist to (1)
gain foundational knowledge in immunology and respiratory medicine; (2) increase clinical
understanding of respiratory infections in early life; (3) strengthen her knowledge of multi-omics
interpretation; and (4) deepen her understanding of study design, mentoring, and research ethics. She
is supported by a mentoring team with diverse skill sets and successful mentoring careers which will complement
her training to guarantee the success of this proposal. The findings generated here will pave the way to improved
understanding of the ‘omic contributors to respiratory infection risk and subsequent diseases."
10947461,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) is a complex medical condition characterized by compulsive and maladaptive use
of opioid substances, including prescribed pharmaceuticals (such as oxycodone) and illegal agents (such as
heroin). It causes physiological, psychological, and sociological effects, including tolerance, withdrawal
symptoms, relapse, and impaired daily functioning. Managing opioid use disorder (OUD) involves addressing
withdrawal symptoms and relapse risks during abstinence, which can vary throughout different stages of
recovery.
During the initial phase of opioid withdrawal, individuals often encounter the most severe and debilitating
symptoms. These symptoms typically peak within the first few days of refraining from drug use and gradually
subside with prolonged abstinence. Nevertheless, the most significant challenge during this critical stage of
recovery is the sustained risk of relapse, even after the initial withdrawal symptoms have abated. This risk is
further amplified by external cues that can trigger intense cravings and the compulsion to seek drugs. Hence, it
is imperative to acquire a comprehensive comprehension of the neural mechanisms that underlie relapse
during early and prolonged abstinence from opioid use.
Rodent studies suggest that glutamatergic projections from the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT)
to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) are involved in the expression of negative affective states and relapse after
abstinence. Both PVT and NAc are heterogeneous and complex brain regions with diverse sets of cell types,
functional connections, unique subregions, and neurotransmitter systems. Opponent roles of anterior/posterior
PVT subregions, and D1- and D2-medium spiny neuron activity, has been found for approach/appetitive and
avoidance/aversive behaviors. This research project addresses the critical question of how the PVT interacts
with the NAc to modulate withdrawal symptoms during early abstinence and prolonged abstinence on the
vulnerability to relapse.
This project is an essential step towards my goal of becoming an independent researcher. Through the
K99/R00 grant, I'll have the opportunity to improve my understanding and abilities in advanced neuroscientific
methodologies, which will lay the groundwork for my research program focused on addiction neuroscience.
The knowledge and data I gather during the K99 phase will be a solid foundation for a successful transition to
the R00 phase, which will help me expand my research in this field. Additionally, this work will reveal the
complex PVT-NAc neural mechanisms governing relapsing behaviors, which could lead to innovative
strategies for addiction treatment and prevention."
10896310,"Project Summary Difficulty communicating (aphasia) is one of the most common and debilitating results of left-hemisphere stroke. Although aphasia symptoms are highly variable and recovery is difficult to predict, much research has shown that lesion size and location are major drivers of aphasia symptoms and recovery. However, this previous research has only considered direct anatomical damage caused by the lesion. This is a critical limitation because stroke lesions also cause indirect effects on the function of brain structures distant from the lesion. Throughout this application, I refer to this as “remote dysfunction.” Although initially thought to resolve quickly after the stroke, remote dysfunction is now known to persist throughout recovery and independently contribute to outcomes. Studies of aphasia recovery have focused almost exclusively on the idea of recovery through reorganization, whereby behavioral improvement occurs through plastic reorganization of brain networks. These studies have eschewed the older idea that recovery occurs through partial resolution of remote dysfunction (RRD) caused by lesions. Consequently, it is not clear how RRD contributes to aphasia recovery. The applicant has developed a new machine learning approach called functional anomaly mapping (FAM) that uses resting BOLD functional MRI signal to map remote dysfunction throughout the brain in individual stroke survivors. FAM maps have much better test-retest reliability than current measures, like task- related fMRI activity and resting state functional connectivity, as well as several other features that make it promising as a clinically useful tool. The applicant has already demonstrated that remote dysfunction measured with FAM relates to behavioral outcomes in people with chronic aphasia. During the mentored phase of this award, the applicant will optimize the FAM approach and test competing hypotheses about the biological mechanisms generating the remote dysfunction measured in chronic aphasia. During the independent phase, the applicant proposes a longitudinal study to understand the contribution of RRD to aphasia recovery. The applicant proposes a comprehensive training plan to expand his knowledge in the following areas: the biological mechanisms of stroke recovery and neuroplasticity beyond aphasia, machine learning, biomarker development, and advanced neuroimaging analysis. The research and training during this award will enable the applicant to develop a long-term, independent research program focused on understanding the neural correlates of aphasia and developing translational brain measures to inform clinical decision-making in aphasia neurorehabilitation."
10949774,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the United States (U.S.) an estimated 300,000 youth, ages 13-17 years, identify as transgender and, over the
past decade, increasing numbers of youth have sought gender affirming care. Leading medical organizations—
including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent
Gynecology, the Association of American Medical Colleges, and the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists—consider gender affirming care in adolescence medically necessary standard of care. Youth who
receive gender affirming medical care, for instance, report improved mental health outcomes sustained into
adulthood. Despite these findings and medical consensus, increasing numbers of state-level policies restrict or
ban medical and surgical care for transgender youth. The outcomes of these policies on transgender and gender
diverse youths' psychosocial, mental health, and physical health are unknown. The goal of the proposed study
is to determine the feasibility of a longitudinal, mixed methods study that assesses the outcomes of these state-
level gender affirming care policies on transgender and gender diverse individuals. We will conduct a mixed-
methods feasibility study and pilot with three specific aims: (1) To establish the acceptability of study instruments
in the study population and the sustainability of data collection and management procedures over six-months;
(2) To determine the feasibility of remote recruitment of transgender youth seeking gender affirming healthcare
in U.S. with differing policy contexts, including states with criminalized bans, and those with or without restrictive
policies; and (3) To assess initial, descriptive differences in our primary outcomes of interest, including receipt
of desired gender affirming care, and to describe qualitative themes. In researching the impact of policy changes
on the health of sexual and gender minorities, this project is significant, innovative, and responsive to NICHD
priorities (NOT-HD-22-038). This is the first step in developing a timely study to address two critical knowledge
gaps: (1) The quantitative and qualitative experiences of transgender individuals under the age of 18, which are
underreported in the literature; and (2) The influence of state-level policies on transgender youths' psychosocial
and health outcomes. The results of this feasibility study will inform recruitment strategies, data collection and
instruments, and sample size estimates for a future R01."
10949846,"Abstract: The epidermis provides a critical barrier between the body and its environment; it is composed of
multiple layers of keratinocytes that form robust connections by assembling desmosomes between neighboring
cells. Breakdown of desmosomes induces separation between keratinocytes, called acantholysis, a hallmark of
several skin blistering disorders, most notably Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD). This inherited disease manifests
as recurrent skin erosions causing super-infections, chronic pain, and reduced quality of life for patients.
 The advent of biologic and molecular therapies has brought relief to many patients with inflammatory skin
diseases, but comparable advances for HHD and other genetic cutaneous pathologies remain elusive. Despite
linkage to the ATP2C1 gene more than two decades ago, there are no FDA-approved therapies for HHD and
ablating Atp2c1 in mice did not replicate HHD, hampering translational work. ATP2C1 encodes a Golgi calcium
ATPase SPCA1, but our limited understanding of how SPCA1 loss compromises skin integrity limits rational
drug development for HHD. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we ablated ATP2C1 in human keratinocytes to build cellular
and tissue models of HHD with the goal of delineating its pathogenesis and identifying putative drug targets.
 Our preliminary data show that SPCA1-deficient cells model HHD pathology with impaired cohesion in
epithelial sheets and organotypic epidermis; this is consistent with our finding impaired expression and
trafficking of adhesive proteins as well as abnormal cell morphology suggesting cytoskeletal dysregulation. To
identify pathogenic drivers downstream of SPCA1 loss, we performed RNA sequencing. Our data revealed up-
regulation of (1) Rho GTPase signaling and actin modifiers, which modulate cell-cell adhesion, and (2) stress-
mitigating pathways, including autophagy, the unfolded protein response (UPR), and antioxidant metabolism.
 Our aims will determine how these cellular dysfunctions compromise keratinocyte cohesion and determine
if targeting them can restore epidermal integrity in our HHD model. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that SPCA1
deficiency compromises cell-cell adhesion due to faulty cadherin trafficking and impaired regulation of RhoA
and actin. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that up-regulation of autophagy, induction of the UPR, and dampening
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) could restore tissue integrity in HHD. Combining our established systems for
live cell and tissue imaging with novel biosensors, we will delineate the pathogenic signals downstream of
SPCA1 loss. To validate the functional role of these pathways in adhesion, we will evaluate candidate drugs
using a mechanical dissociation assay, then test if lead compounds restore integrity in our HHD tissue model.
 In sum, the proposed work leverages new human cellular and tissue models to identify pathways that drive
epidermal breakdown in HHD. Results from the planned studies will provide a platform for future work to
validate druggable targets in patient-derived cells and de-identified HHD biopsies with the ultimate goal of
delivering lead drugs for clinical trials aiming to improve skin integrity in patients living with this rare disorder."
10950429,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The CDC estimates that 10% of women between the ages of 15 to 19 test positive for Chlamydia trachomatis
and 50-70% of these infections are asymptomatic. This increases the risk of widespread transmission and
untreated infections, which can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease or infertility in a significant portion of
women of childbearing age. Hence, there is a great need to identify strategies to reduce/prevent transmission
and limit infections to the primary site of inoculation. Within the host cell, infectious elementary bodies (EBs)
differentiate into non-infectious reticulate bodies (RBs) in a pathogen-specified organelle termed the chlamydial
inclusion. During later stages of chlamydial development that precede egress, RBs will undergo secondary
differentiation to form new EBs. The success of Chlamydia as a pathogen is owed to its obligate intracellular
lifestyle and successful completion of its developmental cycle within the inclusion. The size of the inclusion
enlarges over the course of chlamydial development to accommodate the increased number of organisms and
at later stages, the inclusion can occlude much of the cytoplasm and dislocate organelles to the periphery of
the host cell. Yet, the host cell remains relatively unstressed, which allows Chlamydia to promote a “silent”
infection that does not attract unwanted attention from the host immune system. We hypothesize that one
mechanism of maintaining a silent infection is the multiple pathways from which Chlamydia draw nutrients.
Early in infection, the inclusion will intercept free amino acids from the lysosome and form membrane contact
sites with the endoplasmic reticulum. During mid- to late- cycle, the inclusion intercepts post-Golgi exocytic
vesicles to obtain sphingomyelin and cholesterol and recruits transferrin to the periphery of the inclusion via the
slow-transferrin recycling pathway. A previous study in the laboratory demonstrated that the clathrin adaptor
molecule, PICALM, localizes to the chlamydial inclusion. PICALM plays a central role in maintaining
cholesterol homeostasis and regulates transferrin recycling. siRNA knockdown of PICALM in chlamydial
infected cells increased lipid trafficking and transferrin trafficking to the inclusion. These data suggest that
PICALM may function during chlamydial infection to limit host cell stress by maintaining a balance in nutrient
trafficking within the cell. Current data in the field have linked PICALM to managing trafficking in the trans-
Golgi, as part of its role in recycling pathways. Our data also indicate that PICALM may function in part to
maintain Golgi structure and play a role in intra-Golgi trafficking—a previously undescribed finding. For this
current proposal, we hypothesize that Chlamydia manipulates PICALM activity in the Golgi and slow-transferrin
recycling pathways to support host cell homeostasis. A better understanding of how Chlamydia manipulates
these pathways may be useful towards improving efficiency of delivery of novel anti-chlamydial compounds
and/or defining novel mechanisms of previously undefined intersections of subcellular pathways."
10947415,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Robust diagnostics are critical to healthcare. Analysis of circulating nucleic acids such as cell-free DNA
(cfDNA) is a rapidly expanding class of diagnostics in several fields of medicine, including cancer and
infectious diseases. In oncology, detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) often precedes appearance of
disease on imaging, raising the possibility that it can be used for early detection of cancer. But despite
significant improvements in the accuracy and cost of next-generation sequencing, routine use of cfDNA in most
clinical settings remains limited by low sensitivity. The cause of low sensitivity is the intrinsic low level of ctDNA
in plasma. ctDNA fragments bearing tumor-specific features are often absent from a blood draw due to
stochastic partitioning at low ctDNA concentrations. This physical absence of ctDNA fragments cannot be
overcome with more accurate sequencing or better computational approaches after a sample has been
collected. We have developed a novel approach to directly address this limitation at time of sample collection.
Our preliminary results show that an engineered DNA-binding monoclonal antibody (mAb) can protect cfDNA in
plasma and increase recovery of ctDNA by 20-fold. This proposal expands on this finding to understand what
factors are important for improving recovery of ctDNA using mAbs, to engineer mAbs that can recover even
more ctDNA, and to extend this concept to target epigenetic features of cfDNA. Our hypothesis is that
engineering the binding affinity, binding specificity, and pharmacokinetics of mAbs can further improve the
recovery of ctDNA, and that mAbs that target methylated cfDNA can help enrich ctDNA from highly methylated
regions of the tumor genome. In Aim 1, we will test a custom-designed panel of engineered mAbs with different
binding relationships to cfDNA and different Fc modifications to determine what factors influence their
performance. In Aim 2, we will extend this approach to epigenetic markers, focusing on cfDNA methylation.
Taking advantage of the fact that CpG islands are hypermethylated in many tumors, we will develop agents
that can enrich DNA with methylated CpGs, and hence enrich hypermethylated tumor DNA at CpG islands.

10947627,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A detailed understanding of B cell and antibody responses to placental versus foreign antigen will illuminate
how dysregulated responses contribute to pregnancy complications and inform the design of vaccines to best
protect mothers and children from infection. Our published work and new preliminary data highlight two
checkpoints that restrain harmful B cell and antibody responses to the placenta. Checkpoint 1 involves how
antigen interacts with B cells. Placental antigen is modified with sialic acid sugar-carrying glycans
(sialoglycans) and activation of placental-specific B cells is suppressed in a mechanism that is at least partially
dependent upon recognition of sialoglycans by inhibitory receptors on the B cell surface. Checkpoint 2 is a fail-
safe mechanism that protects the conceptus from antibody-mediated attack. This “effector phase” checkpoint is
illustrated by our observation that pregnancy remains unaffected even when high titers of anti-placental
antibodies, experimentally introduced before mating, are present. Notably, both checkpoints are specific to
placental antigen itself. Checkpoint 1 appears to be driven by immunosuppressive sialoglycans that coat
placental antigen. For Checkpoint 2, our data and the literature support the hypothesis that anti-placental
antibodies become modified with suppressive glycans that diminish their function. Because the checkpoints are
placental antigen-specific, maternal B cell responses to foreign antigen remain intact. Our data show that to
foreign antigen, pregnant mice generate B cell and antibody responses commensurate with non-pregnant
mice. However, to our surprise, humoral responses during pregnancy occur seemingly independent of robust
follicular helper T cells (Tfh). Since humoral immunity in non-pregnant hosts is well documented to be
regulated by Tfh, discovery of a Tfh-independent mechanism that enhances humoral immunity during
pregnancy is warranted. We propose to study B cell and antibody responses to placental versus foreign
antigen. Project hypothesis: Sialoglycan modification of placental antigen, suppressed effector capacity of anti-
placental antibodies, and alteration in Tfh-B cell dynamics lead to protection of the conceptus while preserving
immunity to foreign antigen. We submit this application in response to RFA-AI-23-027. Aim 1. Define
mechanisms of placental antigen-specific B cell suppression (Checkpoint 1). Aim 2. Characterize the non-
pathogenic nature of anti-placental antibodies (Checkpoint 2). Aim 3. Evaluate maternal B cell and follicular
helper T cell dynamics in response to foreign antigen. Identifying molecular mechanisms suppressing B cell
activation (Aim 1) and mapping out tolerance pathways that protect the conceptus from antibody-mediated
damage (Aim 2) are the first steps in evaluating how alterations affect pregnancy outcomes. Identification of a
pregnancy factor capable of boosting humoral immunity (Aim 3) would be a significant divergence from the
textbook paradigm and could become clinically useful to boost responses to vaccines and fight infections."

Dysphagia and aspiration are significant health problems associated with aging. By 2030, the United States

deleterious consequences including pneumonia, percutaneous feeding tube placement, long term care facility
admission, and increased hospital mortality. These complications of aspiration must be weighed against
delaying the resumption of oral feeding that is associated with prolonged enteral tube feeding, increased
caregiver burden, patient dissatisfaction, and increased health-related costs. As our population ages, elderly
ARF survivors are growing in number, and are at increased risk for post-extubation dysphagia and aspiration.
The only current treatment options are to modify the dietary texture and/or place enteral feeding tubes while
waiting weeks to months for the dysphagia to resolve. In our previous R21 cohort of 213 ARF survivors, we
identified that at the time of extubation, laryngeal edema was present in 56% of ARF survivors and associated
with a 3-fold risk of aspiration. Corticosteroids may reduce this inflammatory laryngeal edema. Clinical trials
and meta-analyses have demonstrated that peri-extubation intravenous corticosteroids reduce the need for
reintubation, raising the possibility that corticosteroids work through reducing the laryngeal edema. We
hypothesize that a similar dosing regimen of a short course of intravenous corticosteroids could restore normal
laryngeal swallowing function, improve post-extubation dysphagia, and reduce susceptibility of aspiration. This
proposal will continue to utilize our established multi-center research group at Colorado, Boston University,
Stanford, and Yale. We have worked together as a collaborative research group for nearly ten years. With our
current R01 infrastructure, we will conduct a multi-center randomized trial of corticosteroids for ARF survivors
with documented post-extubation laryngeal edema. The patients with laryngeal edema on their post extubation
FEES examination (performed as part of the R01 protocol) will be randomized to 24 hours of intravenous
corticosteroids or an equivalent placebo, and then undergo a repeat FEES examination within 48 hours of the
last study dose. Our primary mechanistic outcome will be improvement in laryngeal edema using the revised
Patterson edema scale, with secondary in hospital outcomes of improved swallowing function and reduction in
aspiration. We will also follow participants after hospital discharge to determine whether corticosteroids
improve quality life including enhanced swallowing function and return to their pre-hospitalization diet. The
results of this R21 proposal will help develop the first personalized therapy for post-extubation dysphagia, a
common disorder in our aging population."
10950280,"The aim of this proposal is to design, fabricate, and test a novel, flexible printed lead body for chronic
implantation as part of peripheral nerve stimulation systems. Treatment modalities that require nerve stimulation
include restoration of motor control and sensation following paralysis or amputation, and chronic pain
management.
 This study will focus on the use of NanoJetTM technology to print electronic traces with a novel design
that will allow for strain relief under static and cyclic loading conditions. The flexible, printed lead body will be
comprised of a flexible substrate, printed metallic ink, and protective barrier to allow for chronic functional and
mechanical reliability. The lead body design will be created to connect with a percutaneous pain management
system of which the mating ends will be customized for the application. Tasks to be accomplished under this
proposal include the design, fabrication, and characterization of the device and its connecting ends. Long-term
structural biocompatibility will be assessed through a series of static and cyclic mechanical tests and in vitro
experiments that will establish chronic functionality. Passive implantation of the device will also provide
information on general biocompatibility. Data collected through evaluations made with test specimens will feed
into the design optimization process and data from full device testing will facilitate future applications to the FDA
to perform follow-on animal studies and future clinical work.
 The proposed effort seeks to improve rehabilitative patient care and the quality of life of Veterans through
the advances associated with the flexible, printed lead body. Implantable neurostimulation systems with high
channel counts provide the best option for nerve selectivity, and if those can be provided in a robust, miniaturized
system that allows for a minimally invasive procedure, then new opportunities for the development of
percutaneous pain management can be realized. Additionally, existing implantable systems for neurostimulation
may benefit from the high-density flexible lead, which would minimize the concerns related to complex
implantation procedures and larger volumes of implanted materials for the same number of channels."
10948403,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chemotherapy remains the most used systemic treatment for cancers. However, despite significant
improvement in chemotherapy agents, chemoresistance remains the major problem in cancer management.
Recently, we discovered that the selective inhibitors of hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A replication complex
elbasvir (Elb) and daclatasvir (Dac), an analog of Elb, may be used to sensitize and re-sensitize solid and
hematologic cancer cells to chemo-drugs. We screened 1855 FDA-approved drugs and found that Elb was
among the top drugs that significantly sensitized multiple myeloma (MM) cells to carfilzomib (Cfz, proteasome
inhibitor), dexamethasone (Dex, corticosteroid), and melphalan (Mel, alkylating agent). Elb and Dac could also
re-sensitize Cfz- or Dex-resistant MM cells to Cfz or Dex respectively. In addition, we observed that Elb and
Dac enhanced chemosensitivity and re-sensitized different types of cancers such as pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma to 5-fluorouracil and gemcitabine (Gem), estrogen receptor‑positive breast cancer (BC) cells
to tamoxifen, and triple negative BC cells to Gem. Moreover, in the presence of Elb or Dac, lower doses of
chemo-drugs were required to induce similar cancer cell death compared to chemotherapy drugs alone. We
discovered that Elb and Dac significantly enhanced drug retention in cancer cells by inhibiting drug efflux
through ATPase phospholipid transporting 9B (ATP9B). Importantly, although tumor microenvironment (TME)
components such as tumor-associated stromal cells (TASCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) can
protect cancer cells from chemotherapy-induced cell death, Elb and Dac abrogated TASC and TAM protective
effects by suppressing pro-tumor lipid secretion, reprogramming them to secrete type-I-IFNs for sensitizing MM
cells to Cfz, and inhibiting TAM release of deoxycytidine for overcoming Gem resistance in solid tumors.
Finally, Elb and Dac significantly improved the therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapies in MM in vivo without
increased toxicity to normal tissues. Therefore, we hypothesize that HCV NS5A inhibitors Elb and Dac can be
developed into cancer therapeutic agents due to their ability to (re)sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapies by
enhancing chemo-drug retention in tumor cells and removing TME-provided protection. To minimize the scope
of this application, we will focus on human MM (hematological malignancy) and use human MM cell lines and
primary MM cells from patients and MM PDX mouse models to test the hypothesis. Aim 1 will elucidate the role
and mechanism of Elb and Dac in sensitizing tumor cells to chemotherapy by inhibiting chemotherapeutic
drugs efflux through ATP9B and Aim 2 will elucidate the role and mechanisms of Elb and Dac in overcoming
TME-mediated extrinsic resistance by inhibiting ATP9B-mediated cholesterol uptake and deoxycytidine efflux.
Accomplishing these aims will provide the justification and tools for developing novel and effective strategies
for targeting both cancer drug efflux and TME to improve the therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapy."

Age is the greatest risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (AD/ADRD) and an
estimated 2.7 million LGBTQ+ Americans are older adults (MAP & SAGE, 2017). LGBTQ+ older
adults face discrimination and persecution throughout their lives, with only some recent legal
protections for their sexual orientation and/or gender identification statuses in the United States.
LGBTQ+ individuals with cognitive impairment are disproportionately impacted by their illness
because of their sexual/gender minority status, which may cause an LGBTQ+ older adult to delay
or avoid seeing a healthcare provider altogether due to fear of sexual orientation/gender identity
discrimination. The economic stability of LGBTQ+ individuals is threatened due to the
stigmatization and discrimination they have faced because of their sexual orientation/gender
identification throughout their lives, which has impeded their ability to save and accumulate
wealth; almost one third (32%) of LGBTQ+ adults aged 50 and older live on 200% of the Federal
Poverty Level or less, in contrast to only 26% of non-LGBTQ+ older adults aged 65 and older.
There are technology products that help foster economic wellbeing through tools that facilitate bill
management and budgeting; however, these products often require a high degree of technical
expertise and provide an insufficient degree of personal support to address the needs of those
with cognitive impairment who identify as LGBTQ+. This application addresses the lack of
financial management and legal support for older LGBTQ+ individuals with cognitive impairment,
because SilverBills will develop and add features to its product that will help prevent fraud,
encourage savings, and provide support for legal matters including legal claim support and
obtaining powers of attorney. The goal of this project is to improve the financial well-being of older
LGBTQ+ individuals with cognitive impairment through SilverBills V.3 financial and legal
management tool. The objective of the administrative supplement to our existing Phase II grant
(award number 5R44AG080843-02) is to receive technical and business funding to further
minimize risk. The proposal is to use the additional funding to become SOC2 (Health Information
Trust) compliant. SOC2 certification determines that SilverBills has met industry-defined
mandates and maintains the highest standards of cyber risk management and patient data loss
prevention. Our central hypothesis is that SOC2 certification will enhance our security protection
beyond cyberthreats. We aim to uphold that the SOC2 certification optimizes our efficiencies and
keeps our internal intelligence protected. As outlined in the parent grant, in collaboration with
researchers from the University of Denver, assess financial wellbeing and mental health in
LGBTQ+ individuals with cognitive impairment. The administrative supplement for Technical and
Business Assistance will benefit the study as the participants' data and software used will have
the highest level of compliance and security."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) exhibits an extraordinary resistance to therapy and often manifests
as metastatic disease. It is characterized by hypoxia, a dense stroma, and metabolic alterations, necessitating
innovative strategies for intervention. Our proposed investigation centers on two main fronts: targeting a redox
signaling protein and developing drug combinations that hold the potential to selectively eliminate the tumor by
disrupting essential survival pathways. This redox factor-1 (Ref-1) is a regulator of critical transcription factors
that fuel pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and resistance to drugs, as well as genes integral to cellular
metabolism. In hypoxic environments, the inhibition of Ref-1 markedly disrupts metabolic pathways (such as the
TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation), along with genes influenced by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). This
interference effectively retards the growth of pancreatic cancer co-culture spheroids and xenografts. An initial
Ref-1 inhibitor (APX3330) has completed phase I trials, showcasing promising attributes: a 32% response rate,
favorable pharmacokinetics, substantial target engagement, and minimal toxicity. Encouraged by these results
and guided by a robust structural-activity relationship (SAR) exploration, we have identified next-generation Ref-
1 inhibitors currently in the lead optimization phase. Additionally, we have devised a strategy for patient selection
based on Ref-1 sensitivity and identified molecular partners likely to synergize with Ref-1 inhibition.
Acknowledging the eventual emergence of resistance mechanisms with targeted therapies, our research
endeavors also encompass the formulation of innovative combination strategies. Our overarching hypothesis
posits that by focusing on the redox function of Ref-1, both as a standalone therapy and in conjunction with
meticulously designed combination approaches, we can induce metabolic vulnerability and effectively curtail
pancreatic cancer growth and metastasis."
10947647,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Environmental contamination by per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) is a major public health concern
because of the wide range of toxic effects that have been associated with exposure to these persistent chemicals.
Due to the strong stability of the C-F bond, very few microorganisms have been found capable of degrading
PFASs, and the biodegradation is very slow and incomplete. Often, bioremediation efforts result in the formation
of shorter chain PFASs that remain toxic, persistent, and highly mobile in the environment. Current abiotic
treatment technologies can be more effective, but have very high energy requirements. Therefore, this research
proposes an innovative remediation strategy that couples a pre-treatment step using catalytic hybrid
nanomaterials with biodegradation using enriched microbial communities to achieve more efficient and complete
destruction of PFASs without the formation of toxic by-products. Multifunctional reduced graphene oxide-metallic
nanohybrids (e.g. rGO-nZVI-TiO2) that are capable of catalyzing defluorination and oxidation of PFASs will be
synthesized and characterized for their efficiencies in converting highly stable PFASs to more biodegradable
forms. Pure cultures (e.g. Dehalococcoides sp. and Dehalobacter sp.) and enriched microbial consortia collected
from PFAS-contaminated sites and anaerobic wastewater treatment plants will be used to degrade different
types of PFASs and measure their removal efficacy. Using metagenomic and transcriptomic tools, the
microorganisms responsible for degradation, their functional characteristics, and the genes being transcribed
during defluorination will be identified. By-products formed at each step of the pre-treatment reaction, and during
the course of the microbial degradation of PFASs will be characterized using liquid chromatography with high-
resolution mass spectrometry, 19F-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and ion chromatography to obtain
information on the identities of PFASs transformation products, degradation kinetics, and mass balance.
Molecular modeling will be used to bring mechanistic insight into specific PFAS-surface and PFAS-enzyme
interactions. The effect of the structural features of PFASs (i.e. branching, chain-length, type of head groups) on
their biodegradability will be systematically evaluated, first by molecular modeling, and then by experimental
validation. Knowledge from the chemical characterization of PFASs degradation by-products combined with in
silico site-directed mutagenesis will facilitate the tuning of enzymatic activities and discovery of novel bacteria
that are efficient degraders of PFASs from the natural environment. These insights will guide the systematic
design of highly efficient nano-enhanced bioremediation systems for complete microbial degradation of PFASs."
10947766,"Convergent Mechanisms for Neurodevelopmental Disorder Genes
 Voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs) are essential regulators of neuronal excitability, making the
dysfunction of NaVs a serious public health concern. Genetic variants in SCN2A and SCN8A, which encode the
neuronal sodium channels NaV1.2 and NaV1.6, respectively, have been identified in several human patient
cohorts of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and epileptic
encephalopathy (EE). The proper localization of NaVs is dependent on their interactions with ankyrins, a family
of intracellular scaffolding proteins that link essential membrane-bound proteins to the underlying cytoskeleton.
Our lab and others have established ankyrin-G, encoded by ANK3, as the master organizer of the axon initial
segment (AIS), a key site of neuronal excitability. Ankyrin-G scaffolds proteins to the AIS, including NaV1.2 and
NaV1.6. Our lab recently identified a critical interaction between NaV1.2 and ankyrin-B, encoded by ANK2, in
mature neocortical pyramidal cell dendrites, where NaV1.2 regulates dendritic excitability. Previous studies have
identified the key residues required for the binding of ankyrins and NaVs. The key residues required for the
interaction between ankyrin-B and NaV1.2 are found within the ankyrin-repeats of ankyrin-B and the intracellular
loop between domains II and III (II-III loop) of NaV1.2. These residues are conserved among ankyrin-B and
ankyrin-G, and NaV1.2 and NaV1.6. Despite this conservation, ankyrins and NaVs have distinct neuronal
localization, suggesting that regions outside of the required residues play a role in the coordination of NaVs.
However, it remains unknown which amino acid sequences determine binding affinity between ankyrins and
NaVs to mediate differential ankyrin-dependent coordination of NaVs.
 Our preliminary data indicate that mutations near the ankyrin/NaV binding interface affect the binding
affinity between ankyrin-B and NaV1.2. The effects of these mutations on the binding affinity between NaV1.2
and ankyrin-G, however, have not been characterized. Furthermore, potential interactions between ankyrin-B
and NaV1.6 have not been studied. Altered binding affinities could explain differences in the localization and
function of these proteins. In addition, limitations in immunocytochemistry techniques have prevented a close
study of NaV1.6 localization outside the AIS. These results would provide critical information regarding the
ankyrin-dependent coordination of NaVs and ultimately help us determine how dysfunction of ankyrins and NaVs
contribute to the etiology underlying neurodevelopmental disorders."

Immune-based treatments for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), an aggressive hematologic malignancy that
remains fatal for over half of the 20,000 patients diagnosed in the United States annually, remain an unmet
clinical need. The impetus to use T cell-based immunotherapy approaches for AML treatment is underscored
by the curative potential of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for AML, arising from immune-
mediated graft-versus-leukemia activity of donor T cells, and by emerging correlative data between the
immune landscape and AML treatment efficacy. Understanding mechanisms of ineffective anti-leukemic T cell
activity in the AML bone marrow (BM), the site where AML emerges, is fundamental for advancing
immunotherapeutic approaches for AML. Our preliminary data highlight the immunosuppressive nature of T
cells within the AML BM, the dynamic evolution of T cell clones with regard to states of T cell activation and
exhaustion, and the immunomodulatory potential of malignant AML cells on T cells. We hypothesize that both
malignant and non-malignant cells in the AML BM promote impaired T cell immunity, leading to distinct T cell
compositions at different disease states. This career development program will address two specific aims: (1)
determine T cell intrinsic features that affect the relationship between T cell phenotype, repertoire, and disease
status in the AML BM, and (2) understand mechanistically how malignant (AML blasts) and non-malignant cells
in the AML BM shape features of the T cell compartment.
The candidate has developed this proposal as an extension of her ongoing T cell studies in hematologic
malignancies and clinical experience in AML. During the award period, she will complete her research with
close counsel from her primary mentor, Omar Abdel-Wahab, MD, an accomplished scientist in leukemia
biology and genomics who is the Chair of the MSK Molecular Pharmacology Program. Additional input will be
offered by her co-mentor, Marcel van den Brink, MD, PhD, an international expert in T cell biology in
hematologic malignancies, and by her Advisory Committee. Drs. Abdel-Wahab and van den Brink are both
mentors with outstanding records of navigating physician–scientists toward research independence. Under
their guidance, the candidate will develop skills that are critical for her future laboratory program, including
learning to generate and analyze syngeneic mouse models of AML, to build upon her knowledge of functional
studies with primary AML samples, and to advance her computational and bioinformatics abilities in
sequencing-based immunologic techniques. Completion of this proposal will provide the candidate with the
training and mentorship required to cultivate and refine her expertise in T cell immunology and leukemia
research and to establish her academic career as an independent laboratory-based clinical investigator
dedicated to advancing immunologic treatments for AML."

Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a genetic disorder resulting from mutations in the ATM protein, essential for DNA
repair and maintaining genomic integrity. Patients with A-T experience neurodegeneration, immune deficiencies,
an elevated risk of lymphoma, and pathological inflammation due to DNA damage. The increased likelihood of
lymphomas, immune deficiency, and neurological decline contribute significantly to the high rates of mortality
and morbidity in A-T. While allogeneic HSCT has been explored using reduced-intensity genotoxic conditioning,
outcomes have varied. In this proposal, we aim to investigate the role of allogeneic HSCT with non-genotoxic
conditioning using immunotoxin in A-T murine models, focusing on correcting underlying immune deficiency,
reducing lymphoma risk, and attenuating the chronic inflammatory phenotype. We hypothesize that this strategy
will correct immune deficiencies, diminish lymphoma risk, and lessen DNA damage-induced inflammation. The
specific aims of the proposal are: 1) To examine the effect of HSCT with non-genotoxic conditioning on the
likelihood of lymphoma in an A-T murine model. 2) To assess the impact of HSCT with non-genotoxic
conditioning on infection risk and inflammatory response in the A-T murine model. We will employ recombinant
saporin-based immunotoxins, including CD117 and CD45- antibody saporin conjugates, combined with non-
genotoxic immune ablation strategies. Completing this research could open avenues for innovative treatments
for A-T and similar genetic disorders by addressing the elevated risk of infection, inflammatory stress, and
associated lymphoma risk through a non-genotoxic HSCT approach."

The University of Florida (UF) proposes to develop a nation-wide digital course to upskill biomedical researchers’
expertise in artificial intelligence (AI). The AI Passport for Biomedical Research (AIPassportBMR) overall
objectives are to provide diverse biomedical researchers the opportunity to augment their skills in a concise and
comprehensive course based on innovative learning techniques and will be the first scalable, self-correcting AI
training program that is dynamic enough to withstand constant evolution of AI technologies. AIPassportBMR will
focus on technical skills while providing mentorship on how to expand biomedical research into the AI field with
highly collaborative sessions that include national leaders in medical AI. Moreover, due to the disparity in the
current AI workforce, participants will be selected to increase diversity and inclusive excellence. Biomedical
research and AI each align with institutional priorities, possess robust resources, and represent highly
collaborative and successful scientific communities at UF. Designed as a digital experiential learning community,
this program will enable predoctoral trainees and early-stage investigators in biomedical, behavioral, and clinical
sciences to acquire the multidisciplinary skills necessary to integrate AI into their research while creating a
nationwide community of likeminded mentors and peers. Our approach aligns with the objectives outlined in the
IPERT initiate to provide skills development and mentoring to an inclusive audience through the following three
overarching aims: Aim 1. AIPassportBMR Program: Develop the educational and technological infrastructure for
community-driven experiential biomedical AI training using a See-Practice-Share-Reflect learning approach, Aim
2. Real-World Evaluation: Implement, evaluate, and fine-tune AIPassportBMR using an implementation mapping
framework and Cognitive Theory of Culture to align instructional design with learners’ subcultural and educational
needs, Aim 3. AI Digital Community of Practice: Build a support mosaic network of peers, mentors and coaches
and the capacity for sustainable nationwide dissemination of the AI research training program.
To further expand AIPassportBMR, the digital community learning platform program will be disseminated
nationwide to build capacity for biomedical AI workforce development and support replication for all biomedical

 Despite decades of concerted efforts, the prevalence of obesity and its associated morbidities such as
type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) continue to climb in the US and racial and ethnic
minority populations living in low-income households and communities are disproportionally affected. Part of
the reason is a well-observed vicious cycle of intergenerational amplification. However, the underlying
pathways driving this cycle remain poorly understood. This proposal aims to explore a novel hypothesis
regarding the role of clinical and subclinical infection and resulting inflammation in the intergenerational
cardiometabolic link. The proposed study is motivated by a strong scientific premise. First, growing evidence
generated by us and others demonstrated that maternal cardiometabolic conditions contribute to child
cardiometabolic risks. This intergenerational link may originate in utero and amplify the cardiometabolic risk in
current and future generations, underscoring the importance of the early life period. Second, there is growing
evidence that infection may lead to both a local and systemic inflammatory state. In the context of maternal-
fetal dyad, maternal infection was found to be associated with increased levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory
cytokine levels in cord blood, independent of vertical pathogen transmission. To date, little is known about
metabolic-immune system crosstalk in early life and health implications. The overarching goal of this project is
to investigate the association of the early life antibody profile to a broad array of pathogenic and commensal
microbes and systemic immunoproteomic profiles in the intergenerational cardiometabolic link. We will also
explore micronutrient status as a protective factor. Specifically, we aim to 1) identify early life immune
response signatures of long-term cardiometabolic outcomes; 2) examine the role of early life immune
responses in the intergenerational cardiometabolic link; and 3) explore the interplay of early life micronutrient
status and immune responses on the intergenerational link of cardiometabolic outcomes. We will leverage the
rich resources of the Boston Birth Cohort (BBC), with ~3,500 mother-child pairs who were enrolled at birth and
followed prospectively. We have shown that the BBC is a high-risk population for adverse cardiometabolic
outcomes. A particularly novel aspect of this study is that we will leverage existing antibody repertoire data
generated by cutting-edge technology (PhIP-Seq) and immunoproteomic profiles generated by the high-
throughput Olink platform at two critical developmental windows: at birth (reflecting the in-utero state) and at
age 1-2 years (reflecting early life immune response). Successful completion of this study will help to deepen
our understanding of the immunologic pathways underlying the intergenerational cardiometabolic link, reveal
novel biomarkers and targets, and lead to a new paradigm for early prediction and prevention to halt or reverse
the vicious intergenerational cycle of cardiometabolic disease."

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare autoimmune fibrosing disease that affects 24.4/100,000 people in the United
States. While rare, SSc has the highest mortality of all rheumatologic diseases. The complication most
associated with this high mortality is interstitial lung disease (ILD). Despite this, there remain limited treatments
for systemic sclerosis associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD), and the treatments that do exist only slow
but do not reverse ILD. To create new and better treatments for SSc-ILD, we need to better understand the
mechanisms that drive fibrosis. A previous study showed that myofibroblasts (the cells that drive fibrosis
through the production of extracellular matrix) are derived from lipofibroblasts in a mouse model of interstitial
lung disease. Thus, the lipofibroblast to myofibroblast transition in systemic sclerosis may represent a novel
target for treatment. To date, however, the mechanisms involved in this transition are not well understood. One
known player in the lipofibroblast to myofibroblast transition is PPARg (peroxisome proliferator activated
receptor gamma), a master regulator of lipid metabolism and adipogenesis. PPARg has been shown to be
downregulated during the lipofibroblast to myofibroblast transition and PPARg agonists reduce fibrosis in
mouse models of ILD. In this proposal, we aim to define the mechanisms through which PPARg is itself
regulated allowing for the lipofibroblast to myofibroblast transition to occur. We will do this by using a
multiomics approach to examine the expression and chromatin accessibility of two genes, PER3 (period
circadian protein homolog 3) and CD36 (cluster of differentiation 36), that we believe function upstream and
downstream of PPARg respectively. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will identify the transitional cell stage during
which lipofibroblasts are transitioning to myofibroblasts and in Aim 2, we will characterize the role of PER3 and
CD36 in the lipofibroblast to myofibroblast transition. Based on previous studies that have defined their roles in
adipogenesis (PER3) and fibrosis (CD36), we hypothesize that PER3 inhibits PPARg transcriptional function
during the lipofibroblast to myofibroblast transition and that downregulation of PPARg during this transition
leads to decreased CD36 expression. Importantly, the use of multiomics allows for an unbiased approach so
that we are not limited to exploring changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility during this
transition in one candidate at a time. The proposed research builds upon my background in lipid metabolism
research during my time on the R38. The experiments outlined in this proposal will take place at UCLA where I
will have access to necessary equipment and core facilities such as the UCLA Tissue Pathology Core
Laboratory and the UCLA Technology Center for Genomics and Bioinformatics to support the successful
completion of my proposed research. In addition, through my career development and training plan, I will
develop new skills in analyzing single-cell RNA-sequencing and ATAC-sequencing data. I will also be able to
use the results of this study as a basis for my future K08 application, which I plan to submit in the fall of 2025."

There is a great need to enable scientists to link brain activity to human movement, perception
and cognition, and social communication and interaction continuously, in real time, and in
naturalistic settings. Such tools will provide profound new insights into not only how the healthy
brain works, but also when and why breakdowns occur in movement, perception/cognition, and
communication. While fMRI is providing greater understanding of how the brain functions in
restricted lab settings, we do not know how it works in dynamic, complex and multisensory real-
world environments. To push this important work forward, we are actively advancing high density
(HD) wearable functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) systems to permit continuous
tracking of human brain function and behavior in real time to understand how a healthy brain
works and how and when failures in simple human actions occur. Here, we are addressing an old
and a new challenge in fNIRS measurements. The old challenge relates to improving the
sensitivity of fNIRS measurements to overcome the issues with hair characteristics and skin tone
that reduces the signal-to-noise ratio and compromises inclusion of all subjects in fNIRS studies.
The new challenge arises as the field develops wearable fNIRS systems and pushes for ultra-
high density (UHD) measurements with more overlapping channels to further improve spatial
resolution and sensitivity to achieve comparable performance in the cortex as compared to fMRI,
but making it challenging to maintain wearability. We will achieve a 5x improvement in detector
signal to noise ratio to benefit all subjects and increase LED peak powers to increase signal to
noise ratio up to 100x in subjects with the most attenuating hair and skin characteristics. We will
achieve another 10x improvement in image contrast to noise ratio afforded by the increased
numbers of overlapping measurements with UHD fNIRS versus HD fNIRS. We will also complete
a demonstrative study of our impact on enabling real-world studies of brain function inclusive of
diverse human subjects, by investigating the impact of mental workload on spatial navigation."

Thousands of migrants arrive yearly at the southern US border. While most are healthy, some
require urgent medical care due to emerging health conditions, exacerbated pre-existing
illnesses, injuries acquired during their treacherous journey, or undertreated, undiagnosed,
unrecognized chronic diseases. These conditions may receive attention along the border
through the assistance of a community-based organization working in isolation, relying on
volunteers. More often, medical needs remain unattended until care is obtained at the migrant’s
destination. This could include a child with a seizure disorder that is out of medications or a
pregnant woman in her third trimester who needs prenatal care to optimize her birth outcome
and her child's health. These newly arrived migrants may be among the most vulnerable with
cascading health disparities including limited financial resources, Limited English Proficiency
(LEP), and limited familiarity with our complex medical system that will make accessing timely
medical care extraordinarily difficult. With lives dominated by other pressing needs such as
establishing a home, finding a job, or enrolling in school, establishing care is a challenge.
Comprehensive data is limited on community health outcomes; however, considerable health
inequities are reported anecdotally. In collaboration with public and private partners, we aim to
foster a community-engaged research project to develop and coordinate a system that will allow
us to identify and connect to care for pregnant women and children with complex medical
needs. We believe we can structural changes that will improve health inequities in collaboration
with the many partners engaged in receiving arriving migrants."

Mast cells (MCs) expand within the airway epithelium during prevalent and burdensome human respiratory
disease, including asthma and nasal polyposis, where they are thought to play a central role in disease
pathobiology. The expanded intraepithelial MC compartment characteristic of Th2 high asthma correlates with
disease severity and therapeutic targeting of this compartment improves patient outcomes, suggesting a
central role in disease pathobiology. Despite this, the mechanism(s) through which intraepithelial mast cells
participate in airway inflammation remain unclear, in part due to a lack of robust pre-clinical models to
selectively target this MC subset in an in-vivo setting. This proposal describes the creation of a novel mouse
strain in which tamoxifen-inducible cre recombinase coupled with a fluorescent reporter tag is selectively
expressed within the lung by inflammation-expanded intraepithelial mast cells, termed mucosal mast cells
(MMCs) in mice, and will use this strain to test the hypothesis that intraepithelial mast cells are an important
contributor to airway inflammatory disease progression. Aim 1 of this study will validate reporter construct
restriction to the MMC lineage across tissues and conduct a timecourse analysis of the dynamics of construct
upregulation and its long-term maintenance within the lung MMCs compartment. Aim 2 will use our strain to
generate inducible MMC knockout mice, which will then be used to test the degree to which MMC regulate
pulmonary inflammation and airway hyperreactivity at two discrete phases of allergic lung inflammation.
Completion of these aims will provide definitive evidence as to the importance of MMC in allergic lung
inflammation and set the stage for future studies using this strain to both determine the mechanism(s) through
which they influence lung inflammation and test their importance in other models of mucosal inflammation,
such as food allergy and eosinophilic esophagitis."

information is particularly important in the absence of an efficacious, preventative vaccine. The
ability to genetically manipulate an organism is essential for the definitive investigation of
relevant biology. Forward genetic approaches provide one of the most powerful strategies
available to accomplish untargeted elucidation of genes contributing to a particular phenotype.
For obligate intracellular bacteria, the full power of forward genetics has been generally
confounded by factors such as low transformation efficiency, complex developmental cycles,
and a requirement for cultivation under selective conditions. The utility of transposon-mediated
random mutagenesis in supporting forward genetics is well established in a multitude of
genetically tractable systems. Although initial progress has been made in Chlamydia, significant
barriers remain that preclude leveraging the full benefit of transposon mutagenesis. We have
engineered a platform that promises to overcome these barriers. We will build on initial progress
to i) create a robust, reproducible, and user-friendly transposon system, and ii) provide genome-
scale evidence for which genes are essential for chlamydial survival in HeLa cells. Both goals
will result in reagents and techniques capable of supporting down-stream studies interrogating
chlamydial biology."

The early postpartum period is a time of significant risk for escalating substance use (SU), as many people who
reduce their SU during pregnancy return to pre-pregnancy levels within 3 months postpartum. Addressing
postpartum SU is key to preventing negative maternal and child health outcomes, but postpartum mothers are
unlikely to seek treatment for SU, due to stigma and fear of child removal. Home visiting (HV), a nationally
available voluntary supportive intervention for high-risk families during the perinatal period, is a promising venue
for reaching new mothers to prevent SU, as it is often one of the only service touchpoints for vulnerable families
during the postpartum period. However, most widely used HV models do not have standardized protocols for
identifying and addressing SU risk. Our team adapted an electronic screening and brief intervention (e-SBI) for
SU and tailored it to the HV context (SBI-HV). The SBI-HV included an e-SBI completed by HV clients
confidentially in between home visits, and a home visitor facilitation component to support integration of the e-
SBI into routine HV. A prior study demonstrated preliminary feasibility and acceptability of SBI-HV. The proposed
study aims to further optimize the SBI-HV by applying a factorial design to examine preliminary impacts of three
SBI delivery strategies: a single e-SBI session (main e-SBI), the main e-SBI plus a booster session (booster e-
SBI), and 4 weeks of tailored text messaging following e-SBI. Additionally, we will systematically assess
implementation facilitators and barriers to inform development of targeted implementation strategies to support
sustainable integration of SBI-HV into routine HV. The proposed R34 will use a Type 1 hybrid implementation-
effectiveness design with a pilot 3X2 factorial trial and apply the RE-AIM and PRISM implementation frameworks
to achieve the following specific aims: (1) test the impact of 3 SBI-HV delivery strategies (main e-SBI; main e-
SBI + booster; text messaging) on postpartum SU, maternal self-efficacy, motivation to avoid SU, and HV
retention; (2) evaluate feasibility, acceptability, fidelity, and facilitators and barriers to the SBI-HV delivery
strategies; and (3) develop tailored implementation strategies to support SBI-HV integration into routine HV. We
will partner with the Kansas Healthy Families (HF) multi-site HV system to complete study aims in 3 phases. The
pre-implementation phase will include a mixed-methods assessment of PRISM domains aimed at selecting
implementation program sites, promoting buy-in from key staff, and informing local adaptations to the SBI-HV.
The implementation phase will include a pilot 3X2 factorial trial with 120 clients and 20 home visitors at 5 sites
to obtain proof-of-concept data on the individual and combined impacts of the SBI-HV delivery strategies. The
post-implementation phase will include qualitative interviews with factorial trial participants and HV staff to assess
implementation facilitators and barriers, followed by an iterative stakeholder-engaged process of developing
candidate implementation strategies for future testing. Study results will inform the design of a future Type 2
hybrid trial to further optimize SBI-HV and rigorously evaluate companion implementation strategies."

Though pregnancy in all cases harbors risk of complications, pregnancy in sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated
with an exceptionally high risk of complications including preterm delivery, deep vein thrombosis, intrauterine
growth restriction, preeclampsia, and intrauterine death. Women with SCD also experience higher cesarean and
maternal death rates. Though the mechanistic drivers of poor pregnancy outcomes specific to SCD are not well
defined, similar complications in non-SCD pregnancy are often attributed to inflammatory dysregulation and
impaired vascular maintenance. These conditions are significantly elevated at baseline in SCD and highly likely
to be exacerbated as pregnancy proceeds.
One principal driver of such vascular impairment and inflammatory dysregulation in SCD is chronic intravascular
hemolysis producing not only anemic conditions but additional release of toxic biproducts including heme. This
circulating heme is detrimental to a number of vascular signaling pathways and is known to overstimulate the
complement system, an innate immune responder whose activity is elevated at baseline in SCD. Under normal
circumstances, well-regulated complement activation is essential to homeostasis and healthy gestation, but
when overstimulated, complement activity acts to promote robust pro-inflammatory responses and local tissue
degradation.
In non-SCD pregnancy, complement over-activation continues to be associated with poor outcomes including
early pregnancy loss, fetal growth restriction, hypertensive disorders, and preterm birth. It is further known to
cause damage to trophoblast and decidual cells in the placenta. It is our belief that this heme-induced
overstimulation of the complement system is at the forefront of the placental insufficiency and poor pregnancy
outcomes seen in SCD. We additionally believe these outcomes can be ameliorated both indirectly through heme
sequestration and directly through complement modulation.
Using a well-established pre-clinical mouse model of SCD we will examine these hypotheses through the
following aims. Aim 1 (K99) Characterize the effects of SCD and heme-induced complement activation on
pregnancy outcomes in the humanized Townes mouse model of SCD and Aim 2 (R00) Determine if heme-
and/or complement- modulation can improve pregnancy outcomes in the humanized Townes mouse
model of SCD. Though poor pregnancy outcomes in SCD continue to be documented, there remains limited
studies aimed at identifying underlying physiological drivers. Successful completion of these aims will provide a
framework for therapeutic investigation moving forward and could establish heme-induced complement
modulation as a viable candidate for further preclinical assessment with the ultimate goal of improving outcomes."
10949780,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by intrusive, distressing thoughts (i.e., obsessions) and
repetitive behaviors (i.e., compulsions) and is associated with significant functional impairment. Despite
established first-line treatments, non-remission and relapse rates following treatment are high (e.g., ~50%),
suggesting the existence of unidentified and untreated mechanisms in OCD. Prior work linking delayed
circadian rhythms to OCD suggests this may be one such mechanism and represent a novel treatment target.
Light therapy is a behavioral treatment that advances circadian rhythms and has been shown to be effective for
reducing symptoms of disorders that are phenomenologically similar to OCD (i.e., posttraumatic stress
disorder; Tourette’s disorder). Light is the primary zeitgeber, or environmental time cue, of human circadian
rhythms, and light exposure also has direct effects on brain regions implicated in psychopathology. However,
no study to date has tested the efficacy of light therapy for OCD. This project will address this gap in the
literature by comparing the efficacy of light therapy (n=20) versus placebo light therapy (n=20) for OCD
symptom reduction in adults with OCD+delayed bedtimes and examining change in circadian phase as a
mechanism. We will also examine photic sensitivity and habitual light exposure patterns in adults with
OCD+delayed bedtimes compared to healthy controls (n=25). Participants will complete 2 weeks of baseline
sleep and OCD symptom monitoring followed by a baseline dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and photic
sensitivity assessment. Participants will then be randomly assigned to the active or placebo treatment condition
and complete 5 weeks of treatment. OCD symptoms and DLMO will be reassessed at the end of treatment.
We will examine whether OCD symptoms improve in the active treatment condition compared to the placebo
treatment condition and whether change in symptoms is associated with advanced circadian phase. We will
also examine whether adults with OCD+delayed bedtimes exhibit heightened light sensitivity and maladaptive
habitual light exposure patterns (lower daytime, higher evening light). Results from this study will inform
whether delayed circadian rhythms can be targeted for OCD symptom reduction. Through this project, I will
complete transdisciplinary training in clinical trials in circadian medicine, advanced methods in light
measurement and photic sensitivity, longitudinal modeling, and professional development, service, and
scientific writing. This project will also provide me with preliminary data to be competitive for an R01 to facilitate
my transition to independence."
10951385,"This project will enable high-sensitivity testing of noninvasive oral swab samples for diagnosis of active
tuberculosis (TB). Pulmonary TB is usually detected by analysis of sputum, a viscous material from human
airways. Sputum collection presents exposure risks and many patients cannot routinely produce sputum for
testing, especially in community settings where most TB transmission occurs. In response to the need for
alternative, non-invasive sample types, we have demonstrated that Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) DNA
can be detected on oral swabs (OS) by using quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis. In TB OS, the tongue
dorsum is gently scraped with a disposable swab. The process is painless and requires just seconds.
“Sputum-scarce” people, who can have risk factors for TB but not yet symptoms, can easily be sampled.
Self-sampling is straightforward.
To further unlock the potential for this approach, the current project will develop and evaluate enhanced
swab sampling methods, using new sample processing technologies combined with a unique set of clinical
sample resources. Specific Aims are: 1) To develop and assess high-capacity OS testing for pulmonary TB;
and 2) To develop and assess protocols for testing serially collected and pooled OS samples for TB
screening.
TB OS has the potential to simplify TB diagnosis, improve the care of many TB patients, and enable active
case-finding strategies that will reduce TB transmission. Thus, this project could help transform the global fight
against TB."
10947949,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 There are various psychological, cognitive, behavioral, medication and neurostimulation treatments
that can improve the outcomes of people with common depressive and anxiety disorders. However, in usual
practice, there is large variability in provider characteristics and delivery of treatments. Routine treatments are
often poorly characterized and structured clinical data on patients are scarce. The effectiveness and quality of
routine mental health services in the community are not accurately monitored and are poorly understood. It
will be necessary to implement monitoring of treatment quality so that treatment and outcomes can be
improved. At present, healthcare organizations, payers, and policy makers usually know little about the quality
of care they support. Similarly, patients and their families have very limited information on quality to guide
their choice of provider or treatment organization.
 This study develops, tests and validates a new, transdiagnostic outcome-focused mental health quality
measure. This measure is based on routine, regular patient reports of their symptoms. The measure can be
aggregated at the provider, clinic, organization or plan level; inform choice of provider; and be used to improve
routine delivery of services and health equity and reduce disparities among patients with common psychiatric
disorders. The quality measure is broadly relevant across community settings and populations, and suitable for
endorsement by regulatory and governing bodies. The study is guided by partnership with stakeholders and
end-users of quality measurement. The project aims to: 1) analyze existing data with responses to a wide
variety of items that are known to assess depression or anxiety, and empirically select symptom items for a
transdiagnostic outcome-focused quality measure; 2) inform risk adjustment and benchmarking of the quality
measure by studying the effects on outcomes of patient, provider, and practice factors, including social
determinants of health, baseline symptom severity, and diagnoses; and, 3) fully specify an outcome-focused
quality measure that includes risk adjustment and benchmarks for improvement; and study, at practices
nationally, its feasibility and psychometric properties, the effect of treatment characteristics on the quality of
care, and the effect of quality on health-related quality of life.
 The study leverages a unique existing database that contains more than 5 million symptom assessments
from 500,000 patients collected during treatment episodes with more than 5,000 providers and 200 real-
world practices. These patient-reported outcomes are supplemented with data on the characteristics of
patients, providers and treatment organizations. Analyses use psychometric methods, item response theory,
and hierarchical and longitudinal modeling to study symptom data from patients over time during episodes of
care. Results support development of an outcomes-focused quality measure than can be used to routinely
assess and improve the quality of mental health services."
10948740,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Chromatin accessibility plays a critical role in determining the gene expression programs that underlie
cellular fates and functions in development and disease. Conserved chromatin modifying complexes, such as
Polycomb-Group (PcG) and Trithorax-Group (trxG) proteins, are believed to engage in a competitive process to
set either repressed or accessible chromatin states, respectively. Mutations in these multiprotein complexes are
known to cause a wide range of diseases, including developmental disorders and cancers. However, the precise
molecular mechanisms that govern the competition between repressive and activating complexes for the
establishment, maintenance, or alteration of chromatin accessibility remain largely unexplored. This K99/R00
Pathway to Independence Award proposal seeks to define the mechanisms and dynamics that shape the
competition between the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) and the activating chromatin remodeler
mSWI/SNF for chromatin accessibility in health and disease contexts.
 The candidate for this award, Dr. Stefan Niekamp, is a biophysicist with experience in microscopy and
biochemistry. He trained in the laboratory of Dr. Ronald Vale at the University of California – San Francisco,
where he determined the conformational dynamics of the microtubule-based motor protein dynein. During his
postdoctoral studies in Dr. Robert Kingston’s laboratory at the Massachusetts General Hospital, he has
established a tractable single-molecule assay which provides a unique perspective with unprecedented
spatiotemporal resolution to derive kinetic models and to determine the sequence of events during transitions
between chromatin states. Combining this reconstitution approach with cellular super-resolution microscopy and
cutting-edge genomic approaches, that the candidate will learn during the mentored phase, this will provide a
powerful system to discern the molecular basis of chromatin accessibility regulation by the competition of
chromatin modifying complexes. To obtain these skill sets, Dr. Niekamp will work with world renowned experts
in the fields of transcriptional regulation, genomics, and super-resolution imaging at Harvard University. In
addition, the candidate will take a suite of courses to advance his professional development. Together, this
project will (i) define the roles of PRC1 composition in organizing chromatin and regulating gene repression (Aim
1), determine how repressive and activating complexes compete to control chromatin structure transitions (Aim
2), and identify the molecular mechanisms of cancer mutations in disrupting the balance between repressive and
activating complexes (Aim 3). The successful execution of this proposal will equip the candidate with a suite of
interdisciplinary skill sets in biophysics, cell biology, and genetics which will provide a robust platform to launch
his career as an independent researcher to decipher the molecular basis of transcription regulation."
10948811,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Heart failure affects 6 million Americans, 1.8% of the US population. Despite substantial progress, heart failure
mortality remains ~50% at 5 years. Mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction in heart failure remain poorly understood.
In this project, we will characterize two cardiac diseases involving mechanisms of infiltration and toxicity: light-
chain amyloid cardiomyopathy (AL-CM), and cancer-therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD). AL-CM
results from plasma cell clones producing abnormal immunoglobulin light chains, which aggregate as amyloid
fibrils in the heart. Median untreated survival is <6 months. CTRCD appears in 7–65% of patients undergoing
anthracycline chemotherapy. One-year mortality is >50% in symptomatic patients. There is an unmet need for a
better understanding of mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction, including the reasons that abnormal light chains or
toxic chemotherapy cause cardiac dysfunction in some individuals and not in others.
Our scientific premises are that (1) cardiac dysfunction is accurately detected and quantified by imaging, and (2)
cardiac dysfunction alters circulating levels of proteins involved in pathogenic mechanisms. Therefore, our
overall approach is to join cardiac imaging and plasma proteomics to identify circulating proteins from relevant
mechanistic pathways and to characterize their relationships with imaging metrics of cardiac dysfunction. To
achieve the aims of this research project, my advisory team and training plan will cover cardiac imaging,
proteomics, AL-CM, CTRCD, and data science.
Our first aim is to identify circulating proteins involved in mechanisms of AL-CM by comparison to non-amyloid
participants and by correlation with imaging metrics of cardiac dysfunction. In the K99 phase, we will analyze a
panel of plasma proteins and compare their levels in participants with AL-CM vs. multiple myeloma (abnormal
immunoglobulins without amyloidosis). Then, we will measure correlations between protein levels and cardiac
amyloid burden by 18F-florbetapir PET, extracellular expansion by extracellular volume (ECV) on MRI, and
contractile dysfunction by global longitudinal strain on echocardiography.
Our second aim is to identify novel markers of CTRCD by group comparisons of plasma proteins levels and by
correlations of protein levels with changes in imaging metrics of cardiac dysfunction. In the R00 phase, I will
analyze a panel of plasma proteins and compare their levels in participants undergoing anthracycline
chemotherapy with CTRCD, without CTRCD, and in matched participants with heart failure. Then, I will measure
correlations between changes in protein levels and changes in ejection fraction or in ECV by MRI over 12 months.
Lastly, I will compare baseline protein levels in patients with vs. without subsequent CTRCD.
The successful completion of this project will support my goal of becoming an independent clinician-researcher
on heart failure, deepen our mechanistic understanding of AL-CM and CTR-CM, improve risk stratification and
prevention strategies, and identify novel drug targets to improve the outcomes of patients with heart failure."

The nasopharyngeal and respiratory mucosa represents a primary barrier to infection by inhaled organisms.
Indeed, the earliest contact point between the airway pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the human
body is the airway mucosa. As a result, M. tuberculosis has evolved to disseminate beyond the oral and
respiratory mucosa to cause systemic disease, thus accounting for its global impact on human morbidity and
mortality. Lining the airway mucosa are specialized epithelial cells that function to transcytose mucosal
antigens from the mucosal surface to the basolateral space. These cells, known as microfold or M cells, overlie
mucosal associated lymphatic tissue where macrophages and dendritic cells await to ingest and present
antigens to B-cells and T-cells. We previously demonstrated that M. tuberculosis penetrates the mucosa via M
cells by using a virulence factor called EsxA and a host receptor, scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1). However, a
major gap in our understanding of the impact of this very early event on the interaction of M. tuberculosis with
the airway is that we do not fully understand M cell biology. Here, we will apply genetic, biochemical,
immunologic, transcriptomic and animal approaches to determine the functional role of M-cells in mucosal and
systemic immunity against M. tuberculosis. Thus, in the proposed research we will: (1) Determine the
transcriptional profiles and functions of novel genes of primary human and mouse airway M cells at a single
cell level under both homeostatic conditions and after experimental M. tuberculosis infection, (2) Identify and
study unique cell-cell interactions of M cells with their adjacent epithelial and immune cells, (3) Characterize
the mechanisms of binding and transcytosis of M. tuberculosis by airway M cells, (4) Determine the
immunologic impact of M. tuberculosis transcytosis across airway M cells. The proposed work is expected to
identify how M cells bind and transcytose M. tuberculosis and how this very early event in the life cycle of M.
tuberculosis dictates the immunologic outcome of infection."

 The MacCHESS Synchrotron Source for Structural Biology facilitates the utilization of both
established and emerging technologies to enable the structural characterization of proteins involved in
critically important biological processes with significant consequences for diseases such as cancer, bacterial
and viral infections, and neurodegenerative disorders. Recent upgrades to CHESS, including improvements
to the storage ring and newly designed beamlines have provided state-of-the-art facilities and enabled
greater capabilities since June 2019. MacCHESS will continue to support more than 100 investigator
projects, funded by NIH and other government institutions, through two major Technology Operations Cores.
These are: 1) Facility for Flexible Crystallography, which will take advantage of unique MacCHESS
capabilities to enable the development of new X-ray techniques that may be used to broaden our knowledge
of essential biological processes. Examples include continued development of methods for room
temperature crystallography toward identifying new structural or ligand/drug binding states, the application
of high pressure to crystals, and analysis of macromolecular motions through the study of X-ray diffuse
scattering. A high level of support for more routine macromolecular crystallography will also be provided.
These methods will help to provide important new insights including the binding interactions and
conformational transitions that cell signaling proteins and drug targets undergo which are necessary for their
function, and the macromolecular motions essential for the catalytic activities of enzymes that regulate key
metabolic processes, DNA transcription and repair, and different aspects of RNA biology. 2) Facility for
Biological Small Angle X-ray Scattering (BioSAXS), which will implement state-of-the-art hardware,
software, and expertise to support the BioSAXS technique that continues to be in high demand. In addition
to determining the shapes of proteins, nucleic acids, and larger protein assemblies in solution, BioSAXS
allows researchers to obtain information regarding global conformational changes within macromolecular
complexes (e.g., membrane receptors, RNA-splicing complexes, large or multi-subunit enzymes) and the
changes in their oligomeric states that have important functional consequences. This core will also provide
the necessary equipment and expertise for investigators interested in performing time resolved BioSAXS or
BioSAXS studies conducted under high pressure. MacCHESS will provide a strong Administration Core to
support these activities and will continue to educate and help to train users and investigators from the
biomedical research community new to the field of structural biology, through a Training and Outreach Core.
Collectively, these efforts will offer unique opportunities to our users for pursuing some of the most
challenging questions in structural biology and for obtaining structure-function information that will ultimately
highlight novel therapeutic targets and aid in the development of clinical strategies for dealing with disease."

We propose a community-based, longitudinal, mixed-methods study to investigate the growing crisis of
xylazine exposure among people who use drugs (PWUD) in the southeastern US. The Office of National
Drug Control Policy recently listed xylazine as an emerging threat and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) warned of xylazine’s growing involvement in fentanyl overdose deaths. Among all US
regions in 2020–2021, the south experienced the largest increase in xylazine-involved overdose (OD) deaths
and the largest rise in xylazine-positive drug seizures. Yet, there remains a paucity of information on
adulteration patterns in local markets, the impact of (un)witting exposure among consumers, how consumers
are responding to xylazine, and drug use behaviors placing people at increased risk for atypical ODs and
novel wounds. CDC recommends testing illicit drugs for xylazine to clarify prevalence in drug supplies and
provide actionable intelligence to inform response. Community-based drug checking (CBDC) will expand the
scientific impact of the proposed study by allowing us to identify patterns of xylazine adulteration within and
across drug classes without having to rely on self-report to identify study participants exposed to xylazine,
thus strengthening our scientific capacity to measure its psychosocial and physiological impact. Aim 1: To
employ CBDC to determine xylazine’s overall prevalence in the illicit drug supply and its relative prevalence
in specific drugs consumed by study participants; Aim 2: To explore knowledge and discernment strategies
among consumers of illicit drugs as they navigate an illicit drug supply increasingly adulterated with xylazine;
Aim 3: To examine the drugs and drug use behaviors of PWUD to determine the psychosocial
consequences, behavioral risks, and adverse sequalae associated with xylazine exposure; Aim 4: To
disseminate real-time CBDC results (Aim 1) and rapidly-analyzed study findings (Aims 2–3) to the
state/county health departments and community-based organizations to inform public health response
. To achieve these aims, we will recruit PWUD from two study sites and their surrounding counties. The
study will be led by Principal Investigator Jon Zibbell, a National Institute on Drug Abuse–funded behavioral
scientist with many years of experience studying injection drug use and infectious disease risk among
PWUD. The team also includes Arnie Aldridge, a National Institutes of Health–funded statistician; Bradley
Ray, a research sociologist; and Sarah Duhart Clarke, an applied psychologist. Findings from the proposed
study will help clarify prevalence of xylazine and illicit markets and identify associated behaviors,
observations, and adverse sequalae by Drug, Set, and Setting factors. The proposed study is poised to
directly inform local and national efforts for combatting harms associated with xylazine use by disseminating
findings to community members and decisionmakers in real-time."

The purpose of the proposed Career Development Award (K01 SERCA) is to provide Dr. Anna Fagre with
protected time and collaborative mentorship so that she can build a strong foundation for her career as an
independent investigator. Dr. Fagre’s proposed K01 career development training plan builds on >7 years of
experience studying bats (order Chiroptera), arthropod vectors, and arboviruses in both the field and the lab.
Importantly, it integrates additional training in three focus areas: (1) development of atypical animal models for
complex studies involving host-arbovirus-vector interactions, (2) advanced training in multi- omics analysis, and
(3) application of comparative approaches in immunology and stress physiology to Chiropteran models of
infection and disease. Dr. Fagre’s proposed K01 research outlines the development of a bat model to
characterize the impacts of thermal stress on host-arbovirus-vector interactions, incorporating novel datalogging
technologies to minimize animal handling while leveraging methodologies used in the fields of stress physiology
and environmental health. Dr. Fagre will explore these questions with 3 specific aims: (1) development of a
Chiropteran model for assessing innate immunity and inflammasome activation in bats exposed to thermal
stress, (2) characterization of ambient temperature’s impact on host-vector interactions in bats following
subdermal inoculation with mosquito salivary gland extract, and (3) quantification of ZIKV infection dynamics and
host responses at different temperatures in cell lines derived from taxonomically diverse bat species. The
anticipated results will contribute to ecoimmunology and ecophysiology studies by expanding our knowledge of
how heat stress affects bat immunology and host-virus interactions. In leading these studies, Dr. Fagre will be
uniquely poised to build out an independent research program interrogating the transmission dynamics of
emerging arboviruses, harnessing a combination of in vivo and in vitro methods supplemented with field-based
studies leveraging her past epidemiologic training. Not only will the proposed aims build a framework within
which to characterize the impact of environmental stress on host-virus-vector interactions and viral infection
outcomes, but results will aid in the identification of valuable diagnostic biomarkers for heat stress and viral
infection. The K01 SERCA award would provide Dr. Fagre with continued funding and dedicated time to
strengthen her research portfolio and build her own research program before applying for tenure-track faculty
positions."
10954299,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer worldwide with an estimated 1.8 million deaths a year,
killing more patients than breast, prostate, and colon cancer combined. Current manual and robotic
bronchoscopes only provide visual feedback to the clinician, and in some cases, the camera needs to be
removed to insert surgical tools (i.e., needles, forceps, or brushes), leaving no direct sensor feedback. Hence,
there is a need for safe, advanced sensing methods to monitor tissue-tool contact as well as tool position and
shape during navigation, diagnosis, and therapy tasks. This supplement research will fulfill these clinical and
technological needs and will ultimately improve procedural safety, biopsy accuracy, and diagnostic yield of
bronchoscopy. This proposal aims at developing and validating miniaturized soft optical sensors for position and
shape monitoring of the soft robotic bronchoscope (developed in the parent grant) as well as tissue-tool contact
monitoring. Soft optical sensors are a promising emerging approach since they are low cost, immune to
electromagnetic interferences, easy to fabricate, and versatile in their design. The sensory information these
sensors provide will act in concert with the onboard microcamera information and can act as a standalone
sensory feedback mechanism in case vision feedback is hampered (e.g., due to bleeding occurring during biopsy
or by inflamed tissue). Our goal is to improve procedural safety as well as robot localization and tracking during
all stages of bronchoscopy (i.e., navigation, diagnosis, and therapy tasks). The proposed work is structured in
two specific aims. Aim 4 focuses on design and manufacturing of miniaturized, multi-modal soft optical sensors
for contact and shape monitoring. The multi-modal soft optical sensors will be created through a laser precision
machining surface functionalization technique of medical soft optical tubing, resulting in a simple, low-cost, and
versatile solution. The capability of the sensors to monitor contact forces and shape will be validated with
dedicated testing setups to measure sensing range and resolution. Aim 5 focuses on sensor integration within
the soft robotic bronchoscope and validation through in-vitro and ex-vivo testing with our clinical collaborator.
We will assess robotic-assisted navigation in-vitro (informed by onboard sensor feedback – contact and shape
sensing) through a desired path, until a specific or desired location is reached in the lung simulator. For ex-vivo
tests, we will use explanted porcine lungs that represent a good analog of human lungs. This will provide insights
into robot operation with actual biological tissue. We will assess robot-tissue contact forces and evaluate
potential tissue trauma by analyzing potential perforations, tears, and bruising locations count by visual
inspection post-procedure. Providing tissue-tool contact monitoring and feedback to the clinician will minimize
risks of airway damage and distortion (currently associated with bronchoscopy). Shape sensing will increase
accuracy, precision, and safety during interventional bronchoscopy procedures.

Adults in
Puerto Rico (PR) experience a high burden of cardiometabolic diseases (CMD), particularly type 2
diabetes (16%) and overweight and obesity (67%). These estimates are higher than those for US mainland
non-Latinx Whites and other Latinx groups. Stress may affect CMD through physiological dysregulation,
negative affect, and dysfunctional eating behaviors (DEB). This is of particular importance to people in PR
given their disproportionate exposure to unique social and environmental stressors that may increase their
CMD risk; yet research on stressors (both chronic and daily) and CMD in PR is scarce, and less is known
about their potential mechanisms and the resilience factors buffering the stress response. Epidemiological
research on stress and CMD has been primarily conducted under standardized conditions using traditional
questionnaires, hindering the ability to capture stress responses to relevant contextual stressors in their natural
environment. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a novel approach that assesses real-time
experiences in their natural environment, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of context-specific
stressors and understanding of early stress responses. As an early-stage investigator, born and raised in PR,
with doctoral and post-doctoral training in Epidemiology and DEB, this K01 will provide training in (1)
epidemiology of CMD in Latinxs, (2) measurement and operationalization of stress, (3) EMA implementation
and analysis, and (4) grant writing and leadership. This K01 will also achieve the overall research goal of
examining novel mechanisms by which stressors influence CMD (negative affect and DEB) in PR adults, and
inform intervention strategies (resilience factors). Specifically, Aim 1 will examine whether adults in PR
experiencing chronic stress (overall chronic stress, financial hardship, and hurricane-related adverse
experiences) have a higher engagement in DEB and concentration of CMD markers. This aim will use data
collected from the PR Observational Study of Psychosocial, Environmental, and Chronic disease Trends
(PROSPECT) at baseline and 2yr follow-up. For Aims 2 and 3, we will conduct a one-week EMA pilot study
within PROSPECT to collect daily data on stressors, negative affect, DEB, and cardiometabolic markers (blood
pressure and continuous glucose, assessed through wearable devices). Aim 2 will examine the relations
among daily stressors, negative affect, DEB, and cardiometabolic markers; and Aim 3 will evaluate if intrinsic
and extrinsic resilience factors moderate associations between daily stressors, negative affect, DEB, and CMD
markers. This research responds to priority areas of NIH NHLBI by advancing health equity in CMD research.
It will make important contributions by focusing on mechanisms and factors influencing the stress response.
This work will provide preliminary data to conduct an R01 for a fully-powered longitudinal EMA study identifying
differences in stressors and their effect on negative affect, DEB, and CMD in PR and mainland US Latinxs."

The oral cavity is a complex environment where a diverse array of organisms coexists in dynamic interplay with
the human immune system. While bacteria, archaea, and fungi have traditionally been the focus of research on
the human microbiome, recent studies have highlighted the significant role of viruses in shaping the oral
microenvironment. These submicroscopic agents, collectively known as the virome, include eukaryotic viruses,
prokaryotic (phages) viruses, and co-infective (virophages) viruses are crucial to maintaining health and may
play a role in the development and persistence of diseases. In ocean and soil communities, viruses have been
found to influence biogeochemical processes and control microbial populations through infection and lysis.
Similarly, in the human oral cavity, viruses may have a substantial impact on oral health. Although research
efforts focused on the oral virome are relatively new, recent technological advancements have made it possible
to explore this area more comprehensively. High-Throughput Sequencing and sophisticated viral discovery
tools have enabled researchers to delve deeper into the significance of viral communities.
While there have been a few recent studies of the virome in the oral cavity providing preliminary evidence of its
importance, there exists a large untapped resource in the form of hundreds of published metagenomic and
metatranscriptomic studies of the oral cavity in varying states of health and disease that have only been used
to study the traditional microbiome. Here we propose to mine this resource using innovative algorithmic
approaches and multi-omic analysis tools to pursue a comprehensive examination of the oral virome and its
interactions with the microbiome. By shedding light on the role of viruses in maintaining oral health and
contributing to disease, this research will illuminate a neglected member of the oral microenvironment and
potentially have far-reaching implications in the search for alternatives to antibiotics, such as phage therapies.
Understanding the intricate dynamics of the oral microenvironment will inspire new approaches to promote oral
health and prevent/manage oral diseases more effectively."
10948573,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Building realistic models for disease transmission is deeply challenging. While classic epidemiology models
are powerful for building general insight, real epidemics rarely meet model assumptions. Network-based
models promise greater accuracy, but depend on data that are difficult and expensive to collect and simula-
tion toolkits that either make the same simplifying assumptions of classic models or build realism in largely
ad hoc ways. Here we leverage community science to build a collective repository for network data and sim-
ulation code to allow multiple investigators easier access to a wider and more diverse data foundation. In
Aim 1, we will build a secure-but-shareable repository of village and rural community networks to serve as a
general (and ultimately expandable) resource for disease simulation modeling. Village network data have
been collected by multiple investigator teams, with an initial literature search yielding over 1000 village net-
works covering over 80,000 unique people. We will regularize the data structure and harmonize data con-
tent to provide a composite contact-propensity score necessary for modeling disease. Rural settings are at
significant risk of zoonotic spillover and are thus a key study setting to understand early-phase outbreaks
that could lead to future pandemics. Our repository leverages advances in secure data storage and sharing
that allow us to automate the production of data use agreements for sharing and distributing sensitive data.
In Aim 2, we similarly extend the model toolkit by (a) providing tools to automatically link deposited data to
extant disease simulation packages (EpiModel) and (b) providing an extendable network agent-based simu-
lation codebase that can model multiple types of pathogens, agent responsiveness to disease, competing
information flow, and policy interventions. The toolkit will be modular, with multiple examples so that it is
easy to use and customizable for investigator-driven analyses of disease spread for multiple types of patho-
gens, accommodating dynamic changes to the network as a result of agents’ real-time behavioral adapta-
tions to disease and information flow. In Aim 3, we will run two illustrative computational experiments that
create the foundation for a future substantive R01 on the conditional effects of behavior responsiveness by
network position and overall structure. First, we will examine how different levels of disease-relevant cau-
tious behavior - avoiding contact to stay safe - interact with network cohesion to shape disease trajectories.
Second, we will examine how multiple information and disinformation flows compete over real networks and
how their effect on behavior promotes disease spread. This project will make significant advances in the re-
search community’s ability to build realistic models that integrate actor attributes, interests and behavior
with disease and network structure for understanding and predicting future outbreaks by providing a public
resource that can leverage past data collection and modeling investments in new ways."
10948575,"The Latino Youth and Family Empowerment Study – III (LYFE-III): Bringing to Scale a Culturally-
 Adapted and Evidence-Based Intervention for Latino Families
 Project Summary/Abstract
 Latino families experience chronic stressors that place them at high risk for mental health problems. Latino
youth not only report higher prevalence rates of depression than most other racial and ethnic groups, but they
also report the highest rates of suicidal ideation and attempts across all minority groups. In addition, COVID-19
disparately impacted Latino families and compounded the many stressors and mental health issues that Latino
families face. Indeed, Latino youth reported among the highest rates of loneliness and poor mental health
during the pandemic. Despite high risk for mental health problems, Latino families in the U.S. are underserved
in the mental health care system due to persistent barriers to accessing services, including discrimination,
treatment costs, language barriers, and stigma. This lack of access to mental health resources for Latino
families was exacerbated by the pandemic. The many stressors faced by Latino families, the havoc wreaked
by COVID-19, and the lack of access to mental health care set a precarious foundation for the development of
mental health problems among Latino youth, and effective preventive interventions are greatly needed.
 The Latino Youth and Family Empowerment – III study (LYFE-III) proposed here is an extension of the
present team’s preliminary work (LYFE-I and LYFE-II studies) funded by NIH and represents a unique
opportunity to adapt, scale, and evaluate the efficacy of an online version of Nuestras Familias with Latino
youth who are at risk for mental and behavioral health problems following the pandemic. The scientific premise
of this study is based on: (a) high prevalence rates of mental and behavioral health issues among Latino youth;
(b) the disparate impact of COVID-19 on Latino families; (c) the vital role of parents in their youth’s mental
health; and (d) persistent barriers among Latino families to accessing mental health treatment.
 Accordingly, the following two aims are proposed: (1) to adapt Nuestras Familias to an online format that
can be widely accessed by underserved Latino families. This aim includes the fidelity monitoring, enhancing
efficiency, and manualization of intervention content; and (2) conduct a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-
implementation randomized controlled trial to (a) test the online program’s promise while evaluating target
mechanisms of action (i.e., parenting practices) and their effects on youth mental health outcomes; and (b)
evaluate the feasibility, appropriateness, and acceptability of the online version of the Nuestras Familias.
 The present approach is innovative because it is among the first to harness digital technology to provide
Latino parents with accessible evidence-based mental health resources following a global pandemic. Further,
the technology underlying the intervention will be refined through a process of iterative feedback with Latino
families and community partners to increase the uptake, useability, and acceptability of the intervention. These
contributions will be significant because they will take an important step toward advancing mental health equity
among vulnerable Latino families through increasing access to critical mental and behavioral health resources."

Placental vasculature is critical for the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between
maternal and fetal circulation. Failure to establish this vascular network is associated with fetal growth
restriction and maternal cardiovascular pathologies. However, the signaling pathways that regulate
placental vascular growth and function remain largely unknown. My long-term goal is to elucidate the
cellular and molecular basis underlying placental vascular network formation and function at the blood-
placental barrier, as well as how the placental endothelium affects fetal growth and maternal
cardiovascular health. By utilizing a new genetic tool, the Hoxa13Cre line, that specifically targets
placental vasculature but not vasculature in the embryo proper or yolk sac, I have found that placental
endothelial-specific deletion of transcription regulators YAP/TAZ results in embryonic lethality and
compromised placental vasculature. I propose to investigate the molecular basis for placental vascular
growth and function by leveraging unique genetic tools, advanced imaging, and single-cell genomics
(Aim 1). In addition, I will explore the roles of the placental endothelium in maternal-fetal exchange by
combining mouse genetics and proteomic analysis (Aim 2). These lines of investigation will reveal
transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms by which placental vasculature grows and offer insights into
the roles of the endothelium in the blood-placental barrier. The proposed studies complement my prior
skills while acquiring new training in placental biology, single-cell technologies, and proteomics analysis
to establish a strong foundation to build an independent research career. With a world-class team of
mentors and collaborators with expertise in placental biology, cardiovascular metabolism, and
bioinformatics to ensure exceptional guidance and a supportive, stimulating training environment at the
University of Pennsylvania, I am ideally positioned to fully develop my technical skills and knowledge
in placental vascular biology. Together, the proposed research and career development activities will
be critical for me to develop an independent research program centered around understanding
endothelial regulation in the blood-placental barrier."

10948501,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The gastrointestinal tract is the largest endocrine organ in the human body. This is due to the presence of
intestinal endocrine cells, a scarce yet important cell lineage within the intestinal epithelium. The hormones
produced by these enteroendocrine cells (EECs) exert important metabolic actions including insulin secretion
and appetite regulation among many others. Important examples are the insulinotropic incretin hormones
glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). EECs undergo
differentiation and subspecialize into sub-types characterized by a main hormonal product. However, several
factors have been reported to induce changes in EEC sub-types/hormonal profile, a phenomenon known as
plasticity. In this context, retinol-binding protein 2 (RBP2) is an important protein for intracellular retinoid
trafficking and metabolism. Although it has been described as circumscribed to the enterocytes in the small
intestine, the candidate in this proposal has reported that RBP2 along with other retinoid related proteins are
also present in EECs. Furthermore, ablation of RBP2 results in higher GIP expression and levels in mouse
studies. Gene expression of other EEC hormones is also altered. The hypothesis underlying this proposal is that
the absence of RBP2 affects EEC homeostasis and hormone expression/secretion by unique cellular pathways.
To further understand RBP2 modulatory effects in these cells, the specific aims in this research proposal will: 1)
determine the effects of RBP2 in the modulation of EEC proliferation, migration and survival and the mechanisms
involved and 2) investigate RBP2 and retinoid actions in modulating EEC populations/sub-types and hormone
secretion. These specific aims will be achieved by using specialized transgenic mouse models expressing Cre
recombinase that will allow direct EEC characterizations in global and conditional Rbp2 knockout mice. Studies
on specialized cell and organoid lines where the Rbp2 gene has been manipulated will be performed. Changes
to EEC type, distribution, proliferation, and death will be measured using immunolabeling and qPCR. Besides
unraveling the modulatory effects of RBP2 and retinoids on EECs, the proposed in vivo and in vitro experiments
will provide novel physiological insights essential to better harness the therapeutic potential of these cells. The
applicant, Dr Rossana Calderon, has designed a comprehensive 5-year training program for her career
development into an independent translational researcher. Dr Calderon is an endocrinologist by training who will
expand her knowledge in several areas including metabolic physiology, advanced cellular and molecular biology
as well as acquire technical skills in functional genomics and 3D cell culture generation and manipulations. She
will further refine her skills in scientific writing and research dissemination. This proposal will be carried out at
Columbia University, an ideal environment with vast availability of resources to support her. Dr Calderon will
count with the guidance of a multi-disciplinary mentorship team that will help her with their expertise to
accomplish her goals during the development of her project and her career towards independence."
10948563,"Project Summary / Abstract
Acute psychological stressors rapidly and reliably evoke emotional responses, which involve changes in
self-reported affect as well as peripheral cardiovascular physiology. These affective and physiological
responses to psychological stressors may increase the risk for negative mental and physical health
outcomes. However, the neurobiological mechanisms for these processes are not well understood. This
K01 proposal will test a novel mechanistic model in which heightened activity in the dorsal anterior
cingulate cortex (dACC) in response to acute psychological stress is causally implicated in affective and
cardiovascular responses. Human neuroimaging studies show that heightened stressor-evoked activity
in the dACC is associated with changes in affect and peripheral physiology, yet to date this evidence has
been observational and correlational. Noninvasive neuromodulation methods such as continuous theta
burst stimulation (cTBS), an advanced form of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), combined with
subject-specific neuronavigational targets, electrical field modeling, and double cone coils targeting
deeper cortical structures, can rapidly depotentiate activity in the dACC. This K01 will therefore test the
proposed model using a within-subject, sham-controlled, two-armed counterbalanced design in a cohort
of 55 midlife adults ranging in mood symptomatology. Participants will undergo single sessions of cTBS
to depotentiate dACC activity (i.e., dACC-cTBS) or sham cTBS as a control condition. Immediately
following each session, participants will complete a validated psychological stress task with concurrent
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The proposed K01 will examine effects of dACC-cTBS
on stressor-evoked (1) dACC activity, (2) dACC connectivity, (3) affective reactivity, and (4)
cardiovascular reactivity. Dr. Kraynak has expertise in stress neurobiology, multimodal functional
neuroimaging, and cardiovascular psychophysiology. To successfully complete the proposed study, he
will require additional training in (1) clinical affective neuroscience, (2) TMS methodology, and (3)
translational experimental study design. Dr. Kraynak will complete this training and research in the
Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh, a highly collaborative environment that is an
ideal fit for his interdisciplinary training and research goals. Completion of the training and research plan
in this career development award will enable Dr. Kraynak to transition to an independent investigator
focused on the neurobiology of emotional responses to acute psychological stress. Findings from this
K01 would significantly add to our understanding of the neurobiology of emotional responses to stressors,
potentially confirm the causal contributions of the dACC to emotional reactivity in humans, and inform
future independent neuromodulation studies targeting stress-related psychopathology."
10948553,"Project Summary
Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is responsible for staggering levels of
morbidity and mortality, with ~1.7 million deaths and ~10 million new cases each year. The current TB
regimens for drug susceptible strains, entailing multidrug cocktails for ≥4 months, leave much to be
desired. The cost and logistics of administering standard of care regimens over many months and the
inability of many patients to tolerate the debilitating side effects further complicate the clinical control of
TB. The lingering negative impacts of the COVID pandemic on TB control efforts and increasing challenge
of multidrug-resistant Mtb strains, which have only a ~50% treatment success rate, further highlight the
urgent need for better antibiotics to tackle this problem. Even our definition of what “better” means has
shifted based on recent appreciation of the heterogeneity of mycobacteria subpopulations that must be
eradicated, including replicating and non-replicating bacilli residing both extracellularly and within host cells
in diverse microenvironments. Thus, effective drug combinations must not only access mycobacteria within
different niches and layers of granulomas but also be able to kill Mtb in many distinct metabolic states while
minimizing the emergence of resistance. In order to meet this urgent need for game-changing new
treatment options for TB, it is imperative to maintain a robust pipeline of new anti-TB drug candidates with
the potential to meet these demanding performance criteria. This project seeks to address this need by
building on our recent discovery of a first-in-class series of compounds that kill Mtb via inhibition of a well-
validated but underexploited target enzyme essential for cell wall synthesis. Thus far, we have
demonstrated sub-micromolar potency, enhanced potency against Mtb within macrophages, high
specificity for Mtb, and high selectivity over mammalian cells. We have strong evidence that these
compounds act via inhibition of an essential enzyme involved in mycolic acid biosynthesis for which there
are currently no viable preclinical candidates. The first major goal of this project is hit-to-lead optimization
and elucidation of structure-activity relationships, using whole cell potency and ADME/PK properties as
key drivers of compound prioritization. Secondly, we will employ orthogonal approaches to further validate
the target and ensure that optimized lead compounds remain on-target. Successful completion of this
project will set the stage for subsequent lead optimization and in vivo efficacy studies of a promising new
class of cell-wall targeting TB antibiotics."
10953314,"––– PROJECT SUMMARY ––––––– R21/R33: Alcohol Tolerance as a Driver of Self-Administration ––– PI: Rothenfluh –––
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is still highly prevalent in the US, and the recent pandemic has made it even more
pervasive. Risk factors for the development of AUD include initial resistance to the intoxicating effects of
alcohol, as well as tolerance, where individuals require increasingly larger doses to attain the same behavioral
outcomes. Yet, how the initial reaction to alcohol is related to the development of tolerance, and how both of
them drive alcohol self-administration is not well understood. This R21/33 application responds to NIAAA PAR-
21-250 “Mechanisms of Alcohol Tolerance”, which aims to ”build a framework for the systematic analysis of the
factors that contribute to alcohol sensitivity and tolerance and the mechanisms that regulate tolerance and
transition to AUD”. We use Drosophila as a model organism because they show many alcohol-related
behaviors also observed in mammals that involved conserved molecular, genetic, and even neuronal
mechanisms. Analyzing over 120 distinct genetic manipulations, we recently showed that initial alcohol
resistance is correlated with the development of less tolerance with repeat alcohol exposures. In Aim1, we
propose to similarly, and systematically analyze 49 genes that affect initial resistance/sensitivity and/or
tolerance for their development of experience-dependent alcohol self-administration preference. While
tolerance to alcohol is mostly determined by reduced effects on the motor system with repeat alcohol
exposure, the ‘reward system’ is also blunted by repeat alcohol. This hedonic tolerance is characterized in
humans by experiencing less ‘pleasure’ with various rewards than before drug experience, while rodents
become less responsive to normally reinforcing stimuli with hedonic tolerance. Based on our promising
preliminary data, we will develop a robust and convincing assay for hedonic tolerance in Drosophila (Aim2). In
order to progress to the R33 phase of the proposal, our MILESTONE is to successfully accomplish Aim2 by
clearly defined metrics. Upon achieving this milestone, we aim to investigate genetic, molecular, and neural
mechanisms of hedonic tolerance in Drosophila. In Aim3 we will investigate how the mechanisms and
neuronal circuits affecting motor tolerance overlap with hedonic tolerance. Lastly, Aim4 proposes to
investigate the molecular and neuronal mechanisms of hedonic tolerance, with both these Aims testing our
overarching hypothesis that molecular mechanisms are (partially) overlapping between motor and hedonic
tolerance, but the circuits mediating them are distinct. We will also test how mechanisms of hedonic tolerance
affect experience-dependent alcohol preference. Together, these Aims yield much needed insight into the
relevance of tolerance in AUD, especially hedonic tolerance, which has been labeled “key” to understanding
AUD."
10950420,"Abstract. Currently there are limited therapeutic treatments to slow, prevent, or cure
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease or Alzheimer’s-related Dementias.
Instead, most therapies rely on managing symptoms. These neurodegenerative diseases are
characterized by accumulation of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and impairment of
proteasome-mediated protein degradation. This R36 proposal aims to investigate small
molecule 20S proteasome activation as a novel strategy to resolve both pathogenic events. Our
group has identified fluspirilene and N-acyl-fluspirilene as a novel class of small molecules that
not only activate the 20S proteasome to degrade IDPs, but also overcome IDP-induced
proteasome impairment. The overarching aims of this project are to (1) identify the mechanism
by which the N-acyl-fluspirilene class selectively enhances 20S proteasome activity, and (2)
develop enhanced small molecule activators of the 20S proteasome. Successful completion of
this work will enable the rapid design, development, and identification of 20S proteasome
activators, and elucidate the role of 20S proteasome modulation in neurodegenerative diseases
as a novel therapeutic strategy for disease treatment."
10950421,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Xylazine has become an increasingly common adulterant that is often unknown to the user. The combination of
xylazine with fentanyl is particularly prominent with xylazine now recognized as an escalating factor in fentanyl
overdose deaths. How xylazine potentiates fentanyl toxicity including the basic dose/response, however, remains
unclear. Both fentanyl and xylazine produce respiratory depression and it is generally accepted that co-
administration increases potency for both, thereby enhancing the potential for profound hypoventilation that if
left untreated can lead to hypoxic organ damage and death.
Less well appreciated is that unlike fentanyl, intravenous xylazine has significant direct adverse cardiovascular
effects that can lead to substantial reductions in blood pressure and cardiac output (whole body blood flow).
Implications of this in the context of co-administration are two-fold. First, while the brain and other vital organs
exhibit intrinsic autoregulatory responses to maintain blood perfusion and oxygen delivery over a range of blood
pressure and blood flow, this autoregulation has limits when the blood pressure is very low and/or metabolic
disturbances such as acidosis are superimposed. Recently published data indicate that, at least for the brain,
xylazine also blocks some aspects of cerebral autoregulation that are not significantly altered by fentanyl alone.
Second, since oxygen delivery to tissues is the product of both the oxygen content of arterial blood and blood
flow, xylazine may enhance fentanyl toxicity by not only potentiating respiratory depression to produce
hypoxemia but also by reducing organ perfusion. Additionally, in that fentanyl is metabolized in the liver and
clearance is largely dependent upon hepatic blood flow, it is possible that xylazine-induced reductions in cardiac
output may also enhance fentanyl toxicity by impairing its clearance.
Currently, there are no controlled robust data specifically defining how the dose/respiratory response for fentanyl
is altered by xylazine (or vice versa), how xylazine may enhance fentanyl toxicity by further impairing oxygen
delivery, or whether xylazine alters fentanyl clearance. The proposed studies will address these fundamental
knowledge gaps using anesthetized swine extensively monitored to provide assessment of a wide range of
respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic endpoints as well as biochemical makers of end-organ damage.
Importantly, since the doses associated with clinical toxicity manifest as respiratory depression are unknow, we
will first define within the experimental model of this exploratory study the dose/respiratory depression response
relationship for fentanyl and xylazine individually and use these data to guide subsequent co-administration
studies."
10951270,"Mechanism of neutrophil dysfunction by Plasmodium falciparum secreted histidine-rich protein II
People with malaria infection caused by Plasmodium falciparum are significantly more susceptible to invasive
bacterial infections during and in the weeks following acute malaria infection. Plasma from infected patients can
modulate neutrophil function, a critical aspect of the immune response for controlling bacterial infection.
Interestingly, neutrophils isolated from children with malaria have an impaired oxidative burst even at 4 weeks
following malaria infection. Proposed models of neutrophil dysfunction suggest a role for heme induction of heme
oxygenase 1, an enzyme known to reduce the production of reactive oxygen species in neutrophils by down-
regulating expression of NADPH oxidase subunits. However, heme does not remain elevated after malaria
infection and does not explain the persistent neutrophil dysfunction. We propose a model that incorporates
histidine-rich protein II (HRPII), an abundant secreted parasite protein that circulates as a nanoparticle. Notably,
HRPII has a long half-life and persists in children with malaria for up to 4 weeks. We previously showed that
heme-laden HRPII (HRPII:heme) delivers a high load of intracellular heme, inducing reactive oxygen species
(ROS), inflammation, and cellular junction disruption in vascular endothelial cells and causes vascular leakage
in mice. In preliminary studies using a model human neutrophil-like cell line (dHL60), we have found that
HRPII:heme, unlike free heme, does not directly stimulate the oxidative burst. Pre-treatment with HRPII:heme
prior to dHL60 stimulation with PMA results in decreased oxidative burst within a few minutes. It also causes a
slow but dramatic induction of heme oxygenase 1. The goal of this proposal is to identify the molecular
mechanisms by which neutrophils sense HRPII:heme and the signaling pathways that are required to impair
oxidative burst activity. Our first aim utilizes targeted molecular blockade in dHL60 cells of known pathways of
HRPII cellular effects and neutrophil pathways involved in oxidative burst signaling. Our second aim will utilize
an unbiased approach with transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) of dHL60 treated with HRPII and a genome-wide

insight into how HRPII affects neutrophils and, in time, potential therapeutics to prevent invasive bacterial

10951271,"Project Summary
Professional phagocytes, including macrophages and dendritic cells, engulf approximately 200 billion dead cells
per day in humans. The vast majority of dead cells are consumed “silently,” in that the phagocyte does not trigger
an adaptive immune response targeting the material in the engulfed cell, thereby maintaining tolerance of self.
Phagocytes play a critical role in maintaining self-tolerance, and their accurate decision-making during
phagocytosis is essential for avoiding catastrophic immune rejection of self antigens. On the other hand,
immunogenic cell death (ICD), in which an engulfed cell is interpreted as having died following infection with a
pathogen, is critical for launching an effective immune response against viral pathogens and tumors. The
immunogenicity of pathogen-induced cell death is known to depend on the detection of pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRR) in phagocytes. By contrast, the mechanisms
governing the regulation of ICD in sterile contexts (such as autoimmunity and cancer) are significantly less well
understood. Our lack of knowledge of the molecular signals that govern ICD directly impedes our ability to
develop rational therapeutic strategies to either trigger or suppress ICD. We argue that the absence of systematic
genetic tools for understanding this complex, inter-cellular process has critically hindered the progression of the
ICD field. We propose a systematic approach for investigating the mechanisms governing ICD, building on our
recent development of a suite of platforms for high-throughput interrogation of the genetics of myeloid cell biology.
We will focus our efforts on three key “blind spots” in our knowledge of the three sequential stages of ICD: 1) the
mechanism of calreticulin-independent cellular uptake, 2) the mechanism of DAMP/adjuvant release by dead cells,
and 3) the mechanisms governing PRR-driven antigen presentation in APCs. The project is designed to have high
impact by providing the ﬁrst systematic investigations of this core immunological process and by potentiating
therapeutic targeting of these pathways in autoimmunity, cancer, and infectious diseases."
10950730,"Project Summary: We propose a two-year qualitative study that will characterize transitions to low-frequency
injecting and injection cessation among people using xylazine-adulterated fentanyl in one of the states
(Connecticut) most impacted by this drug supply change. America's drug supply has grown become more volatile
since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the proliferation of xylazine-adulterated fentanyl in
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, and is driving drug-related harms, including increases in non-fatal and fatal
overdoses and severe injection-related soft tissue infections. Amidst the emergence of xylazine-adulterated
fentanyl, researchers have begun to document reductions in injection drug use and injection cessation among
people continuing to use fentanyl. Transitions to low-frequency injecting and injection cessation represent key
strategies for reducing the potential for soft tissue infections associated with xylazine-injecting, as well as the
transmission of infectious diseases (e.g., hepatitis C, HIV). However, the growing proportion of overdose deaths
across the country attributed to non-injection drug use raise significant concerns about overdose awareness and
the responsiveness of harm reduction services to the needs of people transitioning to low-frequency injecting
and injection cessation. Contextualized understandings of how the proliferation of xylazine-adulterated fentanyl
intersects with social, structural, and environmental influences to shape these transitions to low-frequency
injecting and infection cessation and their implications for harm reduction services are urgently needed to
optimize harm reduction approaches. Building on our extensive experience studying the impacts of drug supply
changes, including on drug use behaviors and harm reduction services, we propose the following specific aims:
Aim 1: To characterize how exposure to xylazine-adulterated fentanyl intersects with social-structural influences
(e.g., homelessness, poverty) to shape transitions to low-frequency injecting (≤10 times per month) and injection
cessation (>30 days). Aim 2: To explore perceptions of overdose vulnerability associated with non-injection drug
use of xylazine-adulterated fentanyl, and examine their implications for overdose prevention messaging and
harm reduction service delivery. Aim 3: To explore challenges and opportunities for harm reduction strategies,
including syringe exchange, naloxone, and community health programs, in addressing overdose vulnerability
among people exposed to xylazine-adulterated fentanyl transitioning to low-frequency injection drug use or
injection cessation. Informed by the equity-focused Intersectional Risk Environment framework, we will conduct
qualitative interviews with people using xylazine-adulterated fentanyl across Connecticut (n=50) who have
transitioned to low-frequency injecting or injection cessation (Aims 1&2), as well as focus groups with harm
reduction workers (n=30) from across the state (Aim 3). Findings will be mobilized to develop evidence-informed,
scalable research, policy and program recommendations to address harms associated with xylazine-adulterated
fentanyl, including the design of new interventions."

Adolescents commonly develop delayed sleep schedules in normal development related to physiologic
processes, turning into “night owls” (late chronotype). Youth-onset type 2 diabetes (YoT2D) is a disorder with
fast progression and early complications. Delayed sleep timing has been identified as a possible modifiable
risk factor for YoT2D. Although prior studies have linked shifted sleep timing to impaired glucose metabolism,
these studies may not extrapolate to youth with late chronotype as they utilize standard morning testing with
oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs), at a time mis-aligned to the typical schedule of an individual with late
chronotype. As glucose tolerance worsens as the day progresses until the middle of the night in healthy
individuals, testing at a time when youth with late chronotype are typically asleep may alter results and lead to
potential mis-diagnoses. Under the expert mentorship of Drs. Sheela Magge and co-mentor, Jonathan Jun, Dr.
Talia Hitt will investigate whether alignment of glucose metabolic testing with chronotype improves glycemic
outcomes and whether alignment of first morning meal timing to chronotype improves post-prandial glycemic
response in youth with late chronotype. The proposed study uses a novel and rigorous randomized cross-over
study design in youth (17-23y) with late and non-late chronotype (n=35 per group) to assess the glycemic
effect of “aligning” an OGTT or first-meal of day to a subject’s chronotype. Both groups will undergo 2 OGTTs
(aligned and mis-aligned with chronotype) to compare glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity within-subject
(primary outcome) and between groups (Aim 1). Then, youth will also undergo two standardized meals
(aligned and mis-aligned with chronotype) while wearing continuous glucose monitoring to compare post-
prandial glucose excursions within-subject and between groups (Aim 2). A pilot Exploratory Aim 3 (n=12 per
group) will investigate delayed melatonin patterns under dim-light as a potential pathophysiologic mechanism
behind abnormal glucose tolerance in youth with late chronotype on morning OGTTs. This study has potential
implications for both clinical and research practices, as well as meal timing recommendations. It will provide
preliminary data for a future R01 study of the relationships between sleep and circadian rhythm with glucose
metabolism and YoT2D risk. This Career Development Award will develop Dr. Hitt’s training in 4 areas of focus
addressing gaps in her prior research background: (1) longitudinal data analysis, (2) glucose metabolism
mathematical modeling, (3) sleep and circadian phenotyping, and (4) experimental study design. Training
goals will be accomplished through didactic coursework, one-on-one meetings with expert mentors and a multi-
disciplinary advisory team, the study’s research activities, and attendance at scientific and career development
seminars, and conferences. Dr. Hitt will have all needed resources and a supportive environment at Johns
Hopkins. By the end of this 5-year award, Dr. Hitt will have the necessary skills to reach her long-term career
goal to become an independent researcher in the intersection of youth chronobiology and glucose metabolism."

More than 80,000 adolescents and young adults (AYAs, ages 15- 39 years) are diagnosed annually with
cancer in the United States, but relatively few enroll on cancer clinical trials (CCTs). Limited AYA participation
on CCTs hinders the ability to further improve AYA cancer care and outcomes. Initiatives to increase AYA CCT
enrollment is urgently needed. This proposal identifies several areas for improvement that are immediately
addressable and shareable within the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC), other medical
centers, and NCI consortium groups. The approach will significantly improve AYA clinical trial participation at
SKCCC by further developing and implementing a clinical trial tool we abbreviate AYA: Alert, Young Adult
Navigation, Alliance, initially within the hematologic malignancies (HM)/pediatric BMT program and then
beyond. These interventions will cross fertilize collaboration at three levels: 1) Patient; 2) Multi-disciplinary
Provider and 3) Center/Systems. The solutions proposed will improve AYA access to and enrollment on CCTs,
strengthen the clinical research enterprise, and address cancer disparities – all NCI priorities. This proposal will
utilize a new multi-faceted alert system that includes an electronic medical record (EMR) alert to identify AYA
patients and the potential clinical trials for which they are eligible. Weekly clinical trial research meetings will
alert the multi-disciplinary team to the AYA clinical trial priority list. Patient alerts via our EMR directly linked to
the patient’s mobile device will highlight CCT enrollment and upcoming appointments. Automating the
identification of trial eligible AYA patients, providing timely information to the study team and physicians, and
keeping AYA patients engaged through EMR directed mobile phone messaging will optimize enrollment and
compliance. A dedicated clinical research nurse young adult navigator will interact early with AYA patients,
help with AYA CCT enrollment, and bridge the knowledge and workflow gap between our adult and pediatric
consortium trials. A cohort of prior AYA CCT participant survivor navigators will serve as spokespeople on our
AYA website and on social media. An AYA psychosocial navigator will round out the partnership to improve
AYA support. Lastly, a multi-faceted education campaign will be launched to improve alliances. NCI-
consortium enrollment issues will be highlighted at joint HM/pediatric BMT clinical research meetings. We will
create cross-network enrollment FAQ documents. Using digital communication, we will provide information to
AYAs about CCTs to supplement discussions with providers. We will extend the ongoing projects initiated by
the Diversity and Inclusion in Clinical Research Program at SKCCC to include an AYA patient focus to optimize
the enrollment of underserved minorities. Best practices identified from this project will be readily transferrable
to the entire SKCCC enterprise and other academic medical centers. As a nationally recognized BMT expert
with a strong commitment to NCI-funded clinical trials and extensive knowledge in clinical research operations,
Dr. Symons is poised to lead these efforts and successfully enhance AYA accruals."

Congenital heart disease occurs in about 1% of births, making it the most common type of birth defect and leading
cause of infant mortality in the United States. Congenital aortic valve disease, one category of congenital heart
disease, frequently requires surgery. Despite generally positive results, undesirable outcomes remain common,
and measures of success are typically based on an empirical, retrospective “guess and check” approach. Due
to heterogeneous disease, clinical trials are difficult to conduct. Two promising procedures are bicuspidization
repair, in which the surgeon constructs a two leaflet valve, and bioprinted valve replacement, a new type of highly
experimental prosthetic valve that can potentially grow with the patient. The optimal valve geometry for both pro-
cedures remains under debate or unknown. Thus, there is an unmet clinical need for engineering design tools to
optimize postoperative valve geometry and improve outcomes. Simulations provide a controllable and efficient
means to predict optimal surgical procedures, and after validation, translate guidelines to the clinic. Central to
this work is a novel and robust modeling framework for simulating heart valves developed by the applicant, Dr.
Alexander D. Kaiser. This research will leverage his modeling methods combined with a multimodal approach
including in vitro and human studies to efficiently translate scientific knowledge to the clinic. Dr. Kaiser pro-
poses to (1) optimize the postoperative leaflet geometry of bicuspidization repair and bioprinted replacement with
simulation-guided design, (2) confirm and validate optimal valve performance in vitro and (3) translate guidelines
to the clinic to advise bicuspidization repairs. Dr. Kaiser has extensive previous training in applied mathematics,
numerical methods and computational modeling of heart valves. His career development plan includes training in
congenital heart disease pathophysiology and methods of surgical treatment, in vitro experimental methods and
medical imaging. The Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Stanford University will provide an outstanding
interdisciplinary environment to enable Dr. Kaiser’s transition from primarily researching applied mathematics
to being an interdisciplinary, medical investigator. Mentor Michael Ma is a leading, innovative pediatric cardiac
surgeon eager to incorporate new scientific information into his surgical practice. Co-mentor Alison Marsden is
a renowned expert in computational modeling of the cardiovascular system. Complementary expertise will be
offered by advisors Drs. Ennis (MRI, in vitro testing), Skylar-Scott (bioprinting), Feinstein (pediatric cardiology)
and Woo (cardiac surgeon). Dr. Kaiser will receive extensive mentoring, guidance and resources to transition to
independence. To conclude, the mentoring, training, research experience and clinical research environment will
prepare Dr. Kaiser to become an independent, interdisciplinary medical investigator. Ultimately, the proposed
research will benefit patients with congenital heart disease who will have better operative outcomes via improved
heart valve function, and thus lead longer, healthier lives."

HIV infection and unintended pregnancy are highly prevalent, life-altering events among adolescent girls and
young women in low- and middle-income countries. Due to a number of biological, social, and structural factors,
adolescent girls and young women in sub-Saharan Africa remain the sub-population most susceptible to HIV
infection. Further, the majority of pregnancies among adolescent girls and young women occur in low- and
middle-income countries with the highest rates found in sub-Saharan Africa. In Zambia, female university
students are a neglected, high-risk sub-population for both HIV infection and unintended pregnancy. Oral pre-
exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and modern contraception are key biomedical prevention tools but increasing the
uptake among young women in sub-Saharan Africa has proven challenging. Based on preliminary research, we
propose to design a novel peer navigator PrEP/contraception mhealth intervention targeting high-risk female
students at the University of Zambia. The peer-navigator intervention will be facilitated by a tablet-based platform
to assess HIV and unintended pregnancy risk, provide education and information, link high-risk young women to
sexual and reproductive services, assess preferences for peer support, track the use of health services, and
provide ongoing support for PrEP and contraception uptake and persistence through regular communication.
Using a mixed methods phased approach guided by integrated behavioral and mHealth theories, we will first
adapt an existing app (PEBRA) using Human-Centered Design and qualitative methods to create a new tablet-
based app to serve as a platform for peer navigators to promote and track PrEP and contraception use among
high-risk female students (Aim 1, R21 phase). After several iterations have been evaluated by stakeholders, we
will test the app and peer-navigator intervention package in a small prospective single-arm trial, collecting data
on the functionality of the app and the acceptably/appropriateness of the peer-navigator intervention (Aim 2, R21
phase). After refining the app and intervention package, we will then thoroughly test the mHealth intervention
through a single-site hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial to 1) determine the
effectiveness of the intervention to increase PrEP use and modern contraceptive use, 2) establish underlying
behavioral mechanisms, and 3) evaluate implementation-related factors that will enhance the likelihood for the
mHealth intervention to be implemented, sustained, and scaled (Aim 3, R33 phase). If proven effective, the peer-
navigator mHealth intervention will provide a scalable model to fill-in persistent gaps in HIV prevention and
reproductive health among young women in high HIV prevalence low- and middle-income country settings."

Respiratory data from five existing human subject datasets will be merged in order to comprehensively
examine the dynamic and coordinated movements of the chest wall system (thorax and abdomen) in persons
with Parkinson’s disease (PD). The precisely coordinated movements of the chest wall are critical for
optimizing speech production and minimizing the work of breathing. One of the most salient speech and voice
symptoms associated with PD is a reduction in speaking volume, a condition known as hypophonia.
Hypophonia is estimated to occur in 80-89% of persons with PD and leads to social isolation and depression
due to a significant adverse impact on spoken communication. Hypophonia has been attributed to several
physiological factors including reduced ribcage compliance, decreased abdominal support, and reduced vocal
fold closure. Asynchronous movement of the chest wall system, however, may be another contributing factor,
which is presently not accounted for in our voice intervention protocols. It is widely reported that persons with
PD exhibit a myriad of motor coordination issues, stemming from basal ganglia and cerebellar dysfunction,
including impaired fine motor dexterity, postural instability, and abnormal gait characteristics. An empirical
study of the dynamic and coordinated movements of the chest wall system during breathing, however, is
lacking in persons with PD. To date, studies have described pulmonary restriction in persons with PD using
static measures of respiratory function (e.g. respiratory muscle strength and vital capacity). There is a critical
need to study the dynamic movement of the respiratory system in order to develop effective and efficacious
approaches to voice intervention. The present application seeks to address this paucity of data through a novel
exploration of thoracoabdominal asynchrony (TAA) and paradoxical motion in a large sample of persons with
PD (n=110). Small-scale studies on TAA and paradoxical motion suggest a high prevalence in persons with
PD during rest breathing. The present application will examine the dynamic movement of the thoraco-
abdominal system across the inspiratory and expiratory cycles of rest and speech breathing (Specific Aim 1)
using standardized measures from the literature. Targeting TAA during speech breathing is innovative as this
has not been studied in any population yet. Further, this study will examine how current voice intervention
protocols, which directly or indirectly target respiration, impact the coordination of the thoraco-abdominal
system during speech production (Specific Aim 2). Our application addresses NHBLI Strategic Objective 5: “To
develop and optimize novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to prevent, treat, and cure National Heart,
Lung, and Blood (NHLB) diseases.” The knowledge gained from this study has the power to transform our
approach to voice and respiratory interventions for persons with PD and lead to efficacious and potentially new
treatment protocols."

I am an early career investigator in the fields of pharmacoepidemiology, health equity, and addiction
psychiatry. My overarching career goal is to become an independently funded researcher dedicated to
investigating the real-world effectiveness of addiction medications with a focus on treatment gaps in
populations underrepresented in RCTs, such as pregnant people. In this K08 award, I am interested in
studying disparities in the prescription of medications to treat opioid use disorder (OUD), specifically
buprenorphine and methadone, and assessing how the segregated landscape of buprenorphine and
methadone availability may be associated with their effectiveness against overdose. The K08 award will
support my early career training in the use of health equity theoretical models, target trial emulation, and
causal inference methods; address my mentorship and career development needs; and enable me to obtain
the data required for my continued transition toward independence. In the proposed K08 research study, I will
address the ongoing yet preventable epidemic of OUD-related overdose during pregnancy, particularly in
segregated Black communities that suffer the highest rates of perinatal overdose death. The specific aims of
the study are (1) to evaluate associations of race and Black–White segregation indexes with buprenorphine
and methadone use and opioid-related overdose during pregnancy; (2) to elucidate differences in
buprenorphine’s and methadone’s effectiveness against overdose by racial subgroup during pregnancy while
adjusting for segregation; and (3) to examine structural racism as a mechanism of the associations between
race and overdose during pregnancy. I will use a target trial emulation-based approach to achieve these aims,
enriching existing Medicaid claims data with data on area-based characteristics to assess how segregation and
structural racism might mediate racial disparities in OUD treatment. The training and research experience I
gain during the proposed K08 award period will be instrumental to my career trajectory, and the data generated
in the proposed K08 study will be foundational to my planned applications for independent R01 funding, along
with supporting NIDA’s goal of developing new and improved strategies to prevent drug use and its
consequences."

Excess body fat, referred to as “adiposity”, is a major contributor to heart disease, the leading cause of death
worldwide. Anti-obesity medications (AOMs) designed to reduce excess body fat not only help with weight loss
but also significantly decrease the risk of heart disease. However, it is unknown whether this reduction in risk is
solely due to weight loss or if AOMs influence other contributing risk factors, such as elevated lipid levels (e.g.,
cholesterol and triglycerides), which are strongly linked to heart disease and adiposity.
In this research proposal, we will evaluate how adiposity alters the biological mechanisms regulating blood lipid
levels by leveraging the genetic nature of lipids and adiposity, and large-scale datasets with clinical and multi-
omics data—genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics—to (1) measure interaction effects between adiposity
and genetic DNA variants on lipid levels; (2) evaluate how genetically determined volumes of adipose tissue
affect lifetime trajectories of lipid levels and heart disease risk; and (3) examine how risk factors in addition to
lipid levels, such as high blood pressure and hyperglycemia, mediate the relationship between AOMs and heart
disease. Completing these research aims will assist in identifying key biological pathways at the adiposity-lipid
intersection and provide insight into whether a risk reduction of heart disease by AOMs is due to mechanisms
beyond weight loss.
This project will be led by Dr. Dron, a computational geneticist with expertise in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism,
clinical and population cohorts, and disease risk assessment. Dr. Dron has developed a comprehensive plan to
complete the above research aims and further her career development by expanding upon her current expertise
with training in adipose biology, obesity, and advanced statistical modeling techniques. This supports her goal
of becoming an independent researcher using genetic-based approaches to investigate new ways to enhance
heart disease prediction, prevention, and treatment by better understanding the biological relationship and
interaction between adiposity and heart disease risk factors.
Dr. Dron’s exceptional advisory team will directly support her career development. Her primary mentor, Dr.
Pradeep Natarajan, is a prominent leader in cardiovascular genomics. The additional members of Dr. Dron’s
advisory team include scientists with diverse experiences in biostatistics, causal inference models, adiposity,
obesity, AOMs, and multi-omic analyses of complex traits. Dr. Dron’s outstanding advisory team and training

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a popular method for neuroscience research in humans.
This imaging tool relies on hemodynamic responses, such as changes in cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood
volume, and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals resulting from neuronal activity in the brain.
Thus, understanding the relationship between neuronal activity and the resultant hemodynamic responses
(i.e., neurovascular coupling) remains a vital area of research for the proper neural interpretation of fMRI
maps. It is generally believed that activity of excitatory output neurons, such as cortical pyramidal neurons,
is the most faithful indicator of fMRI signal changes because there is good agreement between these sensory-
evoked responses in the context of no task demand (e.g., passive exposure to stimuli). However, this
assumption may not be valid in the context of demanding cognitive tasks that are often performed during
human fMRI experiments. In this context, other neuromodulatory signals, which can evoke hemodynamic
responses, seem to play active roles in cognitive processing and sensory information is likely more dependent
on behavioral and perceptual needs. Therefore, it is imperative to establish concurrent recordings of neural
and fMRI signals in behaving animals to understand neurovascular coupling during context-dependent
sensory processing. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the mechanism of context-dependent neurovascular
coupling and understand the neural underpinning of fMRI signals, as is most pertinent to human fMRI studies.
To attain this goal, the overall objective of this application is to determine the relationship between odor-
evoked neuronal activities and fMRI responses in the mouse olfactory bulb and piriform cortex when mice
are engaged in olfaction-based behavioral tasks by using concurrent fiber-photometry calcium imaging and
fMRI. Our central hypothesis is that sensory-evoked fMRI responses dissociate from activities of excitatory
output neurons during context-dependent sensory processing. The rationale for this project is to understand
neurovascular coupling in conditions that pertain to human fMRI with cognitive tasks; namely, neurovascular
coupling in purposeful behaviors. The research proposed in this application is innovative because the study
of neurovascular coupling during context-dependent sensory processing is virtually lacking due to technical
challenges in awake animal fMRI with concurrent neural recordings. At the completion of this project, our
expected outcomes are to identify how behavioral contexts change the dependency of fMRI responses on
excitatory neuronal activities in the olfactory bulb and piriform cortex of behaving mice. Thus, the proposed
research is significant in that it provides a direct and firm assessment of the neural substrates of sensory-
evoked fMRI responses in a behavioral context, which departs from the status quo of other neurovascular
studies performed in passive conditions with no task demand, which is critical for the further utilization of
fMRI in human cognitive research."
10949799,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of mortality globally. Despite
major milestones in understanding the pathophysiology of the disease, 20% of patients suffer from drug-resistant
hypertension where blood pressure is uncontrollable despite the use of 3-4 medications. Patients with resistant
hypertension often exhibit increased sympathetic nerve activity, suggesting the disease may have neural origins.
The homeostatic baroreflex is a neural reflex capable of sensing elevations in blood pressure and reducing
sympathetic nerve activity to restore blood pressure back to optimal levels. Classically, the baroreflex has not
been thought to play a role in the development of hypertension and is rather thought to play a role in short-term
blood pressure regulation. This is due to earlier studies that utilized animal models where nerves innervating the
aortic arch and the carotid sinus were ablated, to investigate whether arterial baroreceptor ablation leads to
hypertension. A major issue with these studies is the fact that the carotid sinus contains both the inhibitory arterial
baroreceptors and excitatory chemoreceptors. Thus, there is a need to develop novel approaches that selectively
target arterial baroreceptors. To this end, I have developed a novel approach to selectively target sensory
neurons innervating the aortic arch in mice. My preliminary studies suggest that, contrary to common belief,
arterial baroreceptors express more than the classical mechanosensitive ion channels. This includes transient
receptor potential and epithelia sodium channels. Thus, I hypothesize that arterial baroreceptors utilize a
combination of gene products to transduce the stretch exerted on the aortic arch into action potentials
that trigger reflex reductions in blood pressure. I further hypothesize that chronic elevations in blood
pressure disrupts the expression of these gene products to alter the relationship between vascular
stretch, neuronal firing, and perfusion pressure. During the K99 phase, I will pursue two aims that require
training in the appropriate cellular approaches to interrogate the first hypothesis. This will be done by utilizing
single nucleotide RNA sequencing in Aim 1 to unravel the genetic identity of arterial baroreceptors. Aim 2 will
link gene product expression to neuronal discharge during baroreception using in vivo multiphoton calcium
imaging. During the R00 phase, I will combine the acquired cellular approaches with my existing integrative
approaches to investigate the role arterial baroreceptors play in the development of renovascular hypertension.
Collectively, the proposed studies will lead to novel fundamental understanding of whether the baroreflex is
implicated in hypertension, which may represent a novel target for the development of anti-hypertensive
therapeutics. In addition, strong mentorship by Drs. Eric Krause and Annette de Kloet, as well as a Mentoring
Committee comprised of experts in the proposed techniques; will provide conceptual and methodological
training, to achieve the research goals and prepare me to establish an independent research program."

To draw causal interpretation and policy recommendations from epidemiological investigations of
environmental mixtures, it is key to quantify the impact of residual unmeasured confounding. Rigorous
evaluation of this potential threat to causal inference faces several challenges. This application, in response to
PA-20-195, will accomplish the following goals: (1) develop sensitivity analyses approaches to detect and
assess the impact of unmeasured confounding bias in the estimation of the overall environmental mixture
effect, single pollutant main effect and interactions among mixture components accounting for uncertainty on
unmeasured confounding structure and strength; (2) apply these approaches in the analysis of a birth cohort of
Bangladeshi mother-infant pairs to characterize the joint effect of metal exposures on child development; (3)
develop and disseminate computationally efficient and user-friendly software for widespread application of the
methods in environmental epidemiology. The proposed work will address methodologic gaps in the causal
investigation of health effects. First, most of observational environmental mixture studies are plagued by
unmeasured confounding bias. Approaches for quantitative bias analysis to investigate the impact of this bias
either assume a single exposure or a single unmeasured confouder and are therefore inadequate. Second,
multicollinearity, skewness of exposures, complex exposure-response relationships and intermediate or time-
dependent confounding challenge valid estimation and inference. We propose to fill these methodological gaps
by developing and applying probabilistic sensitivity analyses and negative control exposures approaches for
quantifying the causal health effects of environmental mixtures under the counterfactual framework in the
presence of unmeasured confounding. We will develop and apply the new methods to estimate the mixture
effect and individual pollutant effect that incorporate quantitative bias analysis for multiple unmeasured
confounders and allow for complex exposure-response relationships of metals and dimension reduction
adopting the Bayesian multiple index model (Aim 1(a)). The approach will accommodate multiple potential
unmeasured confounding structures and incorporate uncertainty on unmeasured confounding structure and
strength (Aim 1(b)). We complement this approach with the negative control exposures approach, which allows
to detect unmeasured confounding leveraging alternative assumptions on the confounding structure (Aim 2).
We will investigate the effect of metal mixtures on birth length and child neurodevelopment in a Bangladeshi
cohort evaluating the impact of unmeasured confounding bias (Aim 3(a)). We will develop user-friendly and
efficient R packages that implement the proposed methods and R shiny apps to allow interactive visualizations
of the results under different hypothesized unmeasured confounding scenarios (Aim 3(b)). Our work has great
potential to have broad impact on environmental epidemiology research and beyond."
10952859,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Human malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum parasites remains a devastating infectious disease marked
by increasing treatment failures with frontline artemisinin combination therapies. Plasmodium parasites have
evolved specialized metabolic strategies that enable them to infect and grow within red blood cells. Identifying
these adaptations will give insight into Plasmodium evolution and identify new parasite-specific therapeutic
targets. Parasites require nutritional iron to support critical metabolic pathways that include DNA synthesis and
repair, ribosome assembly, mitochondrial electron transport chain function, and isoprenoid precursor synthesis
in the apicoplast organelle. Although it has been known for decades that iron chelators effectively block parasite
growth inside red blood cells, the pathways and mechanisms used by parasites to obtain iron for intracellular
metabolism remain sparsely defined. Identification of iron transporters has been especially challenging given low
sequence similarity between many parasite proteins and well-studied proteins from other organisms, including
yeast and mammals. Our long-term goal is to understand essential functions of the apicoplast whose inhibition
causes immediate rather than delayed parasite death. Our overall objective in this proposal is to elucidate an
essential mechanism for iron uptake by the apicoplast, which is critical for parasite synthesis of isoprenoid
precursors and depends on Fe-S cluster biogenesis within this organelle. Basic mechanisms of iron uptake into
the apicoplast are currently unknown. In an exciting preliminary advance, we have used an innovative
affinity screen to identify a highly divergent parasite protein (Pf3D7_1248300) that is targeted to the
apicoplast and shows high structural homology to pentameric metal transporters in bacteria, to which
the endosymbiotic apicoplast is evolutionarily related. In proposed studies, we will test our central
hypothesis that this protein is essential for parasite viability and required for iron-dependent metabolism in the
apicoplast. We will test this hypothesis in two aims. First, we will use CRISPR/Cas9 to tag the gene encoding
this putative transporter to encode an epitope tag and a conditional regulation system that enables ligand-
dependent protein expression. We will use these tagged parasites to test and understand the sub-organellar
localization and essentiality of this protein for parasite viability and apicoplast biogenesis. In a second aim, we
will test if knockdown of this protein selectively impairs iron-dependent metabolism inside the apicoplast. These
studies will unravel a new molecular paradigm for iron mobilization into the apicoplast organelle and unveil a
potential new therapeutic target, especially as preliminary results suggest that small molecules can selectively
target this protein. These studies will also involve the rigorous training of a talented female PhD student from
an underrepresented Native American background and mentorship of a summer undergraduate student through
the Utah Genomics Summer Research for Minorities or Native American Research Internship programs."

There are over 62 million Latinx/a/o people living in the United States (U.S.) making them the largest
minoritized ethnoracial group in the nation. This large and growing group of people faces considerable
disparities in oral health, particularly among its adult population. For example, data from the National Health
and Nutrition examination survey for 2009-10 and 2012-12 shows that Latinx/a/o adults had the highest
prevalence of periodontal disease among adults of all ethnoracial groups. Studies examining the factors driving
oral health disparities within this population group have largely focused on the complex phenomenon of
acculturation, which broadly refers to the process of adopting U.S. mainstream culture’s attitudes, values,
customs, beliefs, and behaviors. However, cultural explanations of oral health disparities through the lens of
individual-level cultural changes ignore the role of structural factors, such as immigration policy, in
(re)producing oral health disparities over the life course and across generations. Therefore, the purpose of the
proposed study is to examine how the daily manifestations of perceived vulnerability due to immigration policy
shapes the oral health of Latinx/a/o adults. Using a mixed-methods approach, our specific aims to advance this
undertheorized area of research are to: (1) examine the association between self-perceived immigration policy
legal vulnerability and clinical and self-reported oral health and (2) explore the racialization experiences of
Latinx/a/o immigrant adults and their U.S. born co-ethnics to identify the sources of immigration policy
vulnerability that shape their oral health. The knowledge generated from this study is the first step towards
understanding the mechanisms by which the structural racialization of Latinx/a/o/ people via immigration policy
affects their oral health. This study is innovative as it will help redirect disparity-reduction efforts in the oral
health field away from the prominent individual-level cultural framework and towards the broader socio-legal
regimes that sustain inequity. This application will also contribute to the NIDCR’s 2021-2026 strategic plan goal
to advance the scientific methods to quantify disparities and inequities in dental, oral, and craniofacial health
and disease."
10952905,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Since 2005, 199 rural hospitals have closed in the US. These closures have resulted in a loss of primary care
physicians, surgical services, limited access to care, preventive services, and treatments, leading to poor
outcomes for rural populations. However, the impact of rural hospital closures on cancer outcomes remains
largely unknown. Recent studies indicate that rural-urban disparities in cancer care are widening, especially
among racial/ethnic minority populations. This disparity could be attributed to the closure of rural hospitals over
the last few decades. There is a limited understanding of the impact of these closures on cancer outcomes and
racial disparities among rural cancer survivors. To address this gap, we propose a systematic examination of
the impact of rural hospital closures on rural cancer survivors among Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with
lung, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers. The objective of this study is to investigate how rural hospital
closures affect cancer outcomes from screening to survivorship and impact racial/ethnic disparities. We will
employ a difference-in-differences methodology to conduct this retrospective longitudinal study using
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and Medicare linkage data from 2000-2019. We
hypothesize that rural counties experiencing hospital closures will exhibit greater disparities in cancer care
continuum than those without rural hospital closures. Therefore, the study's specific aims are to: (1) assess the
effects of rural hospital closures on cancer screening, diagnosis, treatment, mortality, and survivorship care in
rural counties, and (2) examine the impact of hospital closures on minority populations and identify mediators
contributing to these disparities. The findings will help bridge the gap in rural cancer care and guide healthcare
professionals and policymakers in allocating resources for rural hospitals more effectively. Additionally, this study
will provide foundational evidence for the development of alternative medical care services tailored to rural
communities. Ultimately, this research aims to optimize healthcare services for rural cancer survivors and reduce
racial and ethnic disparities associated with rural hospital closures."

In this competing renewal, we propose to continue a 30-year cohort of people who inject drugs (PWID). Since
1988, the AIDS Linked to the IntraVenous Experience (ALIVE) study has followed >5200 PWID in a
community-based cohort in Baltimore, MD, providing critical insight into the natural and treated course of HIV
among urban predominantly minority, disadvantaged PWID. Our team has been highly productive (107
publications in past cycle) and will continue cutting-edge investigations into high HIV/AIDS priority research
questions, while serving as a foundation for an array of HIV-related epidemiological and pathogenesis studies.
The opioid crisis across the US continues and has not abated in Baltimore. Baltimore has one of the highest
US overdose rates and is experiencing demographic and behavioral transitions in the population most affected
by opioid use -- from one that is primarily male, older and minority -- to one that affects more women, younger
and white individuals. At the same time, there has also been a shift in the expression of HIV infection among
PWID. Much of the population of PWID that the ALIVE study has traditionally followed is aging into the decade
of life where HIV and its treatment are complicated by the onset of other chronic age-associated health
conditions; in 2016, 40% of our cohort had >2 non-communicable diseases (NCD). At the same time <50% of
our HIV-positive participants currently have suppressed HIV viral load highlighting a need for a more holistic
approach to HIV care one that more broadly incorporates NCDs. Our proposed continuation will address the
spectrum of the intersecting HIV and opioid epidemics with an eye towards understanding the impact of opioid
use and HIV across the PWID life course. Our Specific Aims are: 1) To monitor temporal trends in the opioid
epidemic comparing HIV infected and uninfected PWID across the lifespan, including characterization of
shifting drug profiles and context over time and their impact on the incidence of fatal and non-fatal overdose,
HIV and HCV infection and mortality. 2) To evaluate the dynamic associations between HIV care continuum
outcomes and prevalence and control of NCDs (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) and their joint impact on morbidity, mortality and quality of life; and 3)
To continue to provide a platform for independently-funded investigations of HIV and drug use. To achieve
these aims, we will 1) continue follow-up of HIV positive and negative PWID (~1500); 2) open recruitment
once; and 3) evolve our data collection methods to include novel field-based, mHealth and drug testing
assessments. The ALIVE cohort is unique in that it comprises a community-based PWID population of both
genders with significant representation of African-Americans who are both in and out of medical care; these
populations have been underrepresented in HIV and drug use research. Given the scientific rigor of the
proposed methods, existing infrastructure, experienced investigators and multiple NIH-funded ancillary studies,
we anticipate continued success and substantial scientific impact in the future.

The parent award funds the Center for Modeling Complex Interactions (CMCI). The goal of CMCI is to support
and facilitate biomedical research by making modeling more accessible and integral to researchers across a
wide set of disciplines. The teams are encouraged to think of modeling broadly (e.g., mathematical, statistical,
molecular) and to recognize that modeling can improve research at every stage, from hypothesis formulation
and experimental design to analysis and interpretation.
This application is focused on better understanding the effects of a wide set of demographics, economic,
health, policy, and healthcare factors on maternal and infant health. Overall, maternal health is a growing
concern in many countries, with a greater impact on areas of rurality, economic disadvantaged populations, as
well as populations that are underserved (persons of color, Native Americans, Hispanics). Simply measuring
maternal health, and its relations to infant health, is challenging. Using limited measurement structures, a
region may appear to have a low level of maternal deaths, yet the problem is often more complicated.
Previous research has shown that many factors, including direct health measures (diabetes, hypertension,
cancer, heart disease), healthcare access (proximity to health care, access to transportation, Medicare
availability), and social determinants of health (education, poverty), can combine to increase the risk of
negative maternal health outcomes.
The central question of this project is: Can we model these complex interactions of factors that drive maternal
and infant health, at spatial and temporal scales which can be useful for policymakers and community leaders
to effect change? Modeling will be conducted across the state of Idaho, at a county level, from 2015 to 2022.
Techniques will be used that allow for the estimation of latent factors, while incorporating geography into the
modeling framework. By combining these latent modeling approaches with spatial weighting, we believe we
can better estimate how maternal health varies given this wide set of spatially explicit variables. In conjunction
with our modeling approach, we will additionally work collaboratively with stakeholders across the state (state
officials, community leaders, private and non-profit organizations) to gain insight as to what they view are the
most important factors which impact maternal and infant health. This knowledge co-production will be
conducted via four (4) workshops across Idaho, where we will use research-driven facilitation techniques to
garner insights which will help to inform our model construction. Using this information, we will refine our
modeling framework, and re-present these results to stakeholder leadership for final review."
10952762,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Systemic sclerosis (SSc), also known as scleroderma, is an idiopathic disease of the connective tissue
characterized by fibrosis of the skin and underlying organs. It has the highest mortality of all rheumatic conditions
and no cure. T cells predominate in lesional SSc skin and patient serum is enriched in T cell cytokines.
Immunosuppression that limits T cell function can decrease symptoms of fibrosis, but also increases patient
susceptibility to infection. An array of functionally distinct T cells are in close-contact with fibroblasts in healthy
skin, and dysregulated T cell-fibroblast crosstalk is thought to be a major driver of disease pathology. However,
while T cells are implicated in SSc progression, no studies have performed a rigorous mechanistic dissection of
T cell-directed changes to fibroblast gene programs in healthy and fibrotic skin. We previously identified a novel
population of cutaneous CD4+CLA+CD103+ T cells in the blood and skin that co-produce IL-22 and IL-13
implicating a role in skin homeostasis. We now find that the frequency of these and other cutaneous T cells are
altered in SSc, though their function in affected patient skin remains unexplored. Our novel preliminary data
show that different cutaneous T cell populations promote distinct fibroblast gene signatures and demonstrate a
strong CD103+ T cell-dependent effect on a newly identified SSc-associated fibroblast subset. We therefore
hypothesize that CD103+ T cell activity is essential for fibroblast homeostasis at the steady state and that normal
T cell-fibroblast interactions are disrupted in SSc, leading to fibroblast dysfunction. This proposal will use single-
cell spatial transcriptomics and innovative organotypic skin culture to fill critical knowledge gaps and overcome
existing technical hurdles in the field. Completion of these aims will build a foundation for the generation of
exciting new hypothesis and will advance a novel organotypic culture model with the potential to recapitulate in
vivo fibroblast heterogeneity associated with disease and tissue dysfunction."

 RNA motifs can be assigned based on their sequence and/or structure, and are central to many
biological processes. Examples of structural motifs include hairpins, internal loops, or bulges, which are known
to serve several functions; similarly, examples of sequence motifs, can be those where a particular sequence
is repeated, or conserved across different organisms/species, and also play important roles in biology. The
Resendiz lab recently found that the palindromic RNA sequence 5'-GUAC- hybridizes with its complement,
with an inherited disorder, when present in various duplex contexts, i.e., within GUAC repeats, double stranded
chains of varying size, hairpin stem and loops, and internal loops. Preliminary data suggests that this `disorder'
can be assigned to regions adopting a Z-type conformation. Importantly, this motif is found in various types of
RNA that include viral RNA, micro-RNA, and transfer-RNA; thus the outcomes of this study will have broader
implications in different biological systems.
 This work will establish the nature of the disorder found in the 5'-GUAC- RNA motif and explore its potential
 relevance in various biological constructs.
 The proposed work represents the first study that considers this sequence, as a motif, and that will
establish the nature of the observed structural changes; which will be of potential importance, broadly.
Structural aspects will be established using a combination of standard biophysical techniques that include
circular dichroism, X-ray crystallography, NMR, electrophoresis, calorimetry, and organic synthesis of models
that will probe various conformational spaces. The information will then be used to understand its impact on
biologically relevant RNA. To this end, the structural impact of the 5'-GUAC sequence will be explored in two
models for viral RNA [Human Rhino virus (HRV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus
isotype-2 (SARS-CoV-2); and one for micro-RNA (miR-486).
 Understanding the elements that are necessary to exhibit the observed behavior, will allow researchers
to treat/use this motif as an important structural element, within various constructs of RNA. The PI's group
hypothesizes that this motif can become a potential druggable target, due to its unique structure and likelihood
to interact with metabolites in a distinct manner; as well as a sequence with unique capabilities to interact with
other biopolymers, i.e., RNA, DNA, or proteins. The proposed research has the potential to be of high impact,
and of interest to various fields."

Profound intellectual disability (PID) is characterized by limited conceptual skills, limited understanding of
symbolic communication, and total dependence on others for self-care. At present, there are no valid measures
of cognition that are sensitive to the range of functioning in individuals with PID; however, these tools are critical
in informing clinical care, person-centered educational/day planning, and clinical trial readiness for this group.
This proposal includes a career development plan to support the PI in acquiring the knowledge and skills
necessary to develop patient-focused clinical outcome assessments (COAs) for individuals with PID. This
expertise is critical to fill the substantial gap in cognitive and functional measures available for this underserved
and understudied group. Training will focus on 1) qualitative and 2) quantitative aspects of measure
development, 3) an understanding of regulatory control as it pertains to the implementation of COAs in clinical
trials as well as ethical considerations in conducting research in this group, 4) skills in partnering with patient
advocates to promote diverse representation in research and 5) skills in effective academic writing and
leadership. Preliminary data support that a foundational aspect of cognition, responsivity, is a meaningful
indicator of functioning for individuals with PID as reported by their caregivers. The proposed research study will
utilize both qualitative and quantitative methods to develop a novel performance measure (PerfO) and observer-
report measure (ObsRO) of responsivity intended for individuals with PID through the following aims: 1) Refine
the concept of “responsivity” within the context of PID. A concept elicitation approach will be used to develop a
reflective model of responsivity for PID through expert panels and caregiver interviews. 2) Develop a novel PerfO
and ObsRO of responsivity for individuals with profound ID. Co-design methods including an expert workgroup,
caregiver interviews, and pilot testing will be used to modify measures of responsivity developed for individuals
with acquired brain injuries in this pursuit. The primary goal of development is to create feasible, valid, and useful
measures of responsivity with the potential to capture meaningful change in individuals with PID. Secondary
goals include maximizing appropriateness for a broad age range and ease of future adaptation (e.g., for specific
genetic etiologies, remote administration). 3) Describe the psychometric properties of the novel PerfO and
ObsRO. Psychometric aspects including feasibility, central tendency and dispersion, reliability, validity, and
provider perceptions of utility will be examined for both measures. An exploratory sub-study will utilize qualitative
and quantitative methods to examine caregiver perceptions of meaningful change on both measures. Through
the achievement of these study aims and related training activities, the PI will obtain the mentorship and training
needed to become an independent clinician-scientist in measure development and validation for individuals with
PID."

This K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award is designed so that the candidate will achieve her long-term goal
of establishing an independent research career focused on the neural control of breathing. Specifically, I will
study how genetic factors influence mechanisms of respiratory motor plasticity. This proposal has been tailored
to supplement the candidate’s background in neuroscience and respiratory physiology with additional knowledge
and technical skills necessary for targeted gene manipulations and cell-specific molecular analysis. These skills
will be applied to a well-studied model of respiratory motor plasticity known as phrenic long-term facilitation
(pLTF), a prolonged increase in phrenic motor output triggered by moderate acute intermittent hypoxia (mAIH).
Hypoxia-induced adenosine release from spinal glia initiates signaling mechanisms that undermine serotonin-
driven pLTF. Factors that increase spinal adenosine levels, such as inflammation and the daily active phase,
further constrain pLTF. Understanding how specific factors undermine phrenic motor plasticity has the
potential to reveal molecular targets for precision interventions, a necessary step to optimize therapeutic
efficacy of AIH in ongoing clinical trails to preserve/restore breathing ability in people with spinal cord injury and
ALS. Apolipoprotein (APOE) alleles (E2, E3 and E4) predict whether healthy individuals express respiratory
plasticity, although little is known concerning how it does so. Exciting preliminary data lead us to hypothesize
that APOE4 undermines pLTF through an adenosine-dependent mechanism, particularly during the rodent
active (nocturnal) phase, when spinal adenosine levels are high (Aim 1). ApoE4 biases microglia (a regulator of
neuroplasticity) towards a pro-inflammatory state and inflammation abolishes pLTF by a spinal adenosine
mechanism. Since both hypoxia and inflammation stimulate phrenic motor neuron-microglia signaling and elicit
ATP/adenosine release, we propose that neuronal ApoE4 exacerbates phrenic motor neuron-microglia
signaling, increasing spinal adenosine levels. When combined with adenosine levels that are already elevated
in the daily active phase, pLTF is suppressed or abolished (Aim 2). Since nearly all lung and CNS disorders are
associated with systemic and/or neural inflammation, the candidate will determine how a widely-studied model
of inflammation (lipopolysaccharide; LPS) and ApoE4 interact in disrupting phrenic motor neuron-microglia
communication in the daily rest vs active phases (Aim 3). The aims of this proposal are supported by abundant
preliminary data and will yield novel information providing a fundamental framework for understanding how
ApoE4 and inflammation disrupt respiratory motor plasticity. A dedicated mentoring committee of successful
scientists will contribute invaluable expertise and guidance, expanding the candidate’s scientific background and
productivity while also providing a strong foundation for success in achieving her scientific and career goals."

Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is indispensable in everyday clinical neuroimaging due to its
capacity for noninvasive whole-brain imaging. It has a significant impact on diagnosing conditions affecting
millions of Americans. Furthermore, advanced dMRI holds promise for mapping microstructural tissue features,
revealing hidden damage in white matter, guiding neurosurgery, and studying complex brain structures.
However, lengthy acquisition times prevent advanced diffusion encodings and high-resolution imaging (≤1mm³)
from reaching clinical applications. To bridge this gap, I propose a novel approach to accelerate advanced dMRI
while maintaining image quality and microstructure sensitivity. This innovative method aims to achieve up to
five-fold speed improvement by efficiently exploiting data redundancy. Structural MRI has only focused on spatial
undersampling data acceleration techniques but dMRI datasets are intrinsically of higher dimensionality due to
the multiple volumes of diffusion encodings that are acquired. My goal is to pioneer a novel imaging approach
called zero-shell imaging (ZSI) that uses tissue biophysics to speed up dMRI data acquisition and improve image
resolution. This technique encompasses joint undersampling in both spatial (k-space) and diffusion weighting
(q-space) domains, facilitating direct reconstruction of diffusion contrasts with fewer spatial samples per diffusion
encoding. Accounting for patient motion between samples and merging sequential images, I aim to optimize the
allocation of scan time, to enable higher resolution and to increase the number of diffusion encodings without
lengthening the overall scan time. Preliminary findings have demonstrated that ZSI can successfully
undersample the diffusion acquisition space, separating diffusion weightings and directions. In Aim 1, I will
optimize a method that reconstructs dMRI signal’s rotational invariants from undersampled q-space protocols.
For Aim 2, I will develop a dMRI sequence that performs joint k-q-space undersampling and a motion-robust
reconstruction algorithm. Both aims will include validation on healthy subjects and reproducibility assessment.
In Aim 3, I will perform an evaluation of the clinical utility for tracking disease progression in multiple sclerosis
(MS) patients and for detecting MS brainstem lesions. Overall, this research will develop an innovative imaging
method that has the potential to transform MRI diagnosis. During the K99 phase of the award, I will benefit from
the mentorship of Profs. Novikov, Fieremans, and Feng at New York University Grossman School of Medicine,
by obtaining additional training in pulse sequence design and microstructure-informed image reconstruction. My
proposed training plan will equip me with the necessary research and professional skills to start an independent
career in the R00 phase, in which I will develop innovative solutions that harmoniously optimize image
generation, data acquisition, and data modeling processes. This work is motivated by observations that the
combined k-q-space samples are sparse and permit massive undersampling. In the long term, the increased
speed enabled by this project may open the window to finally translate microstructure to clinic."

 Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is the leading genetic cause of renal failure, affecting an estimated
500,000 Americans. There is currently no cure for the disease, as we do not know what pathway drives
disease pathogenesis. What we do know is that the driver of this disease localizes to an organelle known as
the primary cilium. Our preliminary data using a novel genetic mouse model provides strong evidence that
ARL13B, a regulatory GTPase that localizes to the primary cilium, drives cyst formation. This proposal aims to
uncover the mechanism of ARL13B action in the cilium, by specifically dissecting its interaction with three
effector proteins using a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches. We prioritized a list of 30+
candidate interacting proteins based on their links to renal cystogenesis, ARL13B interaction, and known
pathways in other tissues. From this list, we are bringing the top three candidates–CDK1, ARL3, and INPP5E–
forward for investigation in this proposal. These top candidates will provide knowledge how they are involved in
kidney cystogenesis and provide Dr. Van Sciver with a framework in which to test other putative interactors of
ARL13B. In Aim 1, we identify critical amino acid residues required for interaction between ARL13B and each
effector. In Aim 2, we directly test ARL13B’s enzymatic activation of ARL3 in driving kidney cystogenesis using
a point mutant ARL13B in vivo mouse model. In Aim 3, we directly test the enzymatic activity of INPP5E, which
requires ARL13B for its localization to cilia, in driving kidney cystogenesis using a point mutant INPP5E mouse
model. Aim 1 will be performed under the co-mentorship of Dr. Rick Kahn, a renowned expert in GTPase
biochemistry, specifically in ARL and ARF family GTPases, and Dr. Tamara Caspary, an accomplished mouse
geneticist. Dr. Van Sciver will receive additional training through didactic lectures in kidney physiology and
purification and analysis of protein complexes. In addition, the Atlanta Network Training in KUH Scientific
Research (ATLANTIS) program offers Dr. Van Sciver opportunities through three cores: research training,
professional development, and networking. The detailed training plan coupled with this proposal will contribute
to the success of Dr. Van Sciver’s overarching goal of becoming a tenure-track faculty member at an academic
or research institution. Long-term outcomes from this proposal will define precise mutations mediating
ARL13B’s interaction with each effector molecule, providing fundamental knowledge with a high probability of
dissecting ciliary ARL13B’s pro-cystic mechanisms in part or in whole. In addition, this proposal will determine
whether ARL13B functions via ARL3 and INPP5E and set up Dr. Van Sciver to test whether ARL13B
specifically acts via CDK1 by generating a mouse in analogous experiments to Aims 2 and 3 in the future. This
5-year research and training plan will allow Dr. Van Sciver to establish an independent research program
identifying mechanisms driving PKD."

Research on the microbiome-brain axis indicates strong bidirectional communication systems between the
microbiome (including the oral microbiota) and the brain. In adults, the microbiome-brain axis is implicated in the
development and maintenance of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and has been examined as a potential AUD
treatment target; however, similar research is lacking during adolescence. In our recent review of the adolescent
oral and gut microbiota, we found that the adolescent microbiome may be vulnerable to alcohol use. It is
important to investigate if the microbiome-brain axis findings from the adult literature can be replicated in
adolescents who use alcohol, or if the developmental aspect of adolescence incurs differential effects. The genus
Lactobacillus is of particular interest in the adult AUD field and provides an ideal initial target for extending
microbiome-brain research into adolescence. Lactobacillus shows a lower relative abundance in relation to adult
alcohol use; has been proposed as a treatment option for adult AUD; and administration in a preclinical model
resulted in brain metabolite alterations (glutamate, GABA, and N-acetylaspartate or NAA) measured with proton
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Combined, these findings indicate that alcohol related alterations to
Lactobacillus may led to brain metabolite level alterations through the microbiome-brain axis. Investigating the
microbiome-brain axis during adolescence will provide insights into a critical piece of the AUD trajectory, as well
as potential prevention (e.g., vulnerability markers) and intervention (e.g., pre/probiotics) targets. The
overarching hypothesis is that the adolescent microbiome-brain axis is impacted by alcohol use. This application
proposes an initial assessment of this hypothesis through novel research that will collect (1) salivary samples to
assess the oral microbiome, with Lactobacillus as the primary genus of interest, and (2) Glu, GABA, and NAA
brain metabolite levels within the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex via MRS. The oral microbiome was selected
for this age range due to increased feasibility and conserved scientific integrity (e.g., resembles the upper
gastrointestinal tract and sensitive to alcohol). We will recruit 126 adolescents (ages 14-18) with no/low alcohol
use (n=42), recent moderate alcohol use (n=42), or recent heavy alcohol use (n=42). The proposed research
plan in this NIAAA K01 application will serve as essential hands-on training to promote Dr. Kirkland’s career
development in adolescent alcohol use through five distinct career objectives: (1) become proficient in oral
microbiome data collection, analysis, and interpretation; (2) develop foundational knowledge of the adolescent
microbiome, specifically its development, the potential effects of alcohol, and its connection to the central nervous
system through the microbiome-brain axis; (3) gain experience in lab management skills to foster independence;
(4) continue training in responsible conduct of research; and (5) enhance scientific writing, grant writing skills,
and science communication skills. The mentorship and research skills gained through this application will set Dr.
Kirkland up to be a successful and prolific NIH-supported independent researcher."
10950721,"Not only is skeletal muscle a target in sepsis that contributes to worse patient health outcomes, including
problems weaning from mechanical ventilation and a greater risk of death, but through release of mtDNA there
is strong potential for skeletal muscle to play an amplifying role in driving the systemic inflammation by activating
damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Therefore, identifying treatments to attenuate adverse muscle
impact with sepsis is one key to improving patient outcomes. This high risk-high reward R21 application explores
the role of an event known as mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) in skeletal muscle as a mechanism for
both muscle dysfunction and mtDNA-mediated escalation of systemic inflammation in sepsis. mPT is triggered
by Ca2+ to cause formation of a non-specific pore across the mitochondrial inner membrane, where
phosphorylation and/or acetylation of the mitochondrial peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase protein cyclophilin D
(CypD) reduces the amount of Ca2+ needed to trigger mPT, whereas knockout of CypD increases the amount of
Ca2+ needed to trigger mPT. Notably, mPT has been demonstrated to occur in various tissues with sepsis but
has so far not been considered in skeletal muscle, despite several studies noting an accumulation in skeletal
muscle of mitochondria with morphological features that are established consequences of mPT. In addressing
the outcomes of mPT in skeletal muscle, we have shown that mPT causes atrophy and dismantling of the
acetylcholine receptor cluster at the neuromuscular junction, and other impacts are likely to be revealed with
further study. Furthermore, mtDNA is released from mitochondria during mPT and higher mtDNA levels in the
circulation predict poor outcomes in septic patients. Considering that skeletal muscle constitutes up to 40% of
body mass, mPT occurring in skeletal muscle has strong potential to play a major role in driving the increase in
circulating mtDNA in sepsis. In addressing this issue, we will test the central hypothesis that knockout of the
mPT-promoting protein CypD in skeletal muscle will attenuate both muscle dysfunction and systemic
inflammation in sepsis to yield improved outcomes in septic mice. We expect that our studies will demonstrate
that in the context of experimental sepsis skeletal muscle-specific CypD knockout will confer protection to
skeletal muscle, attenuate the increase in circulating mtDNA to limit systemic inflammation, and thereby promote
better outcomes in sepsis."

Monitoring treatment response for Kaposi sarcoma (KS) using present clinical judgement is inadequate. While
objective monitoring of KS lesions can be performed, the measurements required are tedious and time-
consuming, making them impractical for use in routine clinical care in busy low- and middle-income country
(LMIC) clinics. This leads clinicians in LMIC to rely on subjective monitoring strategies, which may unnecessarily
prolong treatment and incur unnecessary chemotherapy toxicities. KS remains a major public health threat: it is
the most common cancer and a leading cause of cancer-related death among men in Malawi, Mozambique,
Uganda, and Kenya.1-4 Current standard of care for monitoring KS treatment response is also imprecise. These
methods are based on clinical assessment of lesion area and height and are subject to human variation. They
perform particularly poorly in persons with dark skin, leading to racial inequities in adverse effects including
alopecia, cardiac toxicity, neuropathy, bone marrow suppression, financial toxicity, decreased quality of life, and
premature treatment discontinuation, undermining effectiveness.7,8 To address these challenges, we propose to
test a new technology — SkinScan3D (SS3D) — to elucidate its contribution in clinical practice, optimize
performance, and integrate into workflows in Africa where need is greatest. SS3D is a simple, low-cost, and
user-friendly technology that combines liquid lens technology and artificial intelligence (AI), providing high-
resolution 3D images/maps of KS skin lesions that incorporate lesion height and volume. We will formally refine
the technology to make it user-friendly and easy to integrate into workflows in Uganda and Kenya, determine its
measurement improvements in real-world clinical practice, and assess its contribution to improved clinical
outcomes. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: Refine SkinScan3D Technology and Usage Protocols for Routine
KS Imaging in East Africa. We will engage end-users (clinicians, nurses), and patients to refine SS3D through:
a) focus group discussions; b) discrete choice experiments to identify and quantify preferences for re-design of
hardware, software, and standard operating procedures; and c) iterative Human-Centered Design workshops.
Aim 2: Compare Reproducibility and Accuracy of KS Lesion Size Measurements Between SkinScan3D
and Current Standard of Care Measurement. We will compare the concordance correlation coefficients
(quantitative measure of reproducibility) and coefficients of determination (quantitative measure of accuracy)
between SkinScan3D and the manual method (ruler-based). Aim 3: Validate and Optimize SkinScan3D
Clinical Workflow in Real-World Settings. We will roll out the refined SS3D package to a variety of practice
locations in East Africa to determine whether the device will perform robustly and efficiently in different settings.
Specifically, we will measure: device usability with the System Usability Scale; device acceptability,
appropriateness and feasibility with validated quantitative instruments; clinic workflows and time burden with
time-and-motion studies; and implementation costs with activity-based micro-costing."

The Impact of Hospice Care on the Wellbeing of Alzheimer's Disease Patients and Their Family Members
Given the increasing prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), there is a growing concern over how best to care
for AD patients as they approach the end of life. While two decades ago, relatively few were admitted to hospice,
by 2019 over two-thirds of Medicare decedents with AD died in hospice. Family members of AD patients, often
aptly named “the invisible second patients,” bear a significant burden in the care of their loved ones.
Although AD patients increasingly rely on hospice care, it is not known whether this trend has led to
improvements in the well-being of AD patients at the end of life or the well-being of their family members. This
project aims to answer these crucial questions using novel data and natural experiments. The first aim studies
how hospice care affects the cognitive and functional well-being of AD patients, using large datasets of clinical
assessment measures of pain management, depression, and activities of daily living. Previous research has
primarily relied on cross-sectional methods, which may introduce selection bias as patients opting for hospice
care may differ on many unobservable characteristics from those who do not. This project overcomes this
challenge by leveraging natural experiments arising from the opening of new hospice facilities in local healthcare
markets. In a preliminary analysis, each entrant raised county-level hospice utilization by 10%. Using new
hospice openings as an instrumental variable for hospice use, the project will estimate the impact of hospice use
by comparing observably identical AD patients in areas with increased availability of hospice care to patients in
areas that did not experience changes in availability. The research design is complemented by rich data,
including two decades of Medicare claims and detailed health assessments from the Minimum Data Set and
Home Health Outcome and Assessment Information Set, which together cover over 70% of AD patients.
The second aim studies how hospice care affects the physical and psychological well-being of family members
living with AD patients. On the one hand, if hospice care improves the comfort of AD patients, it could ease the
physical and psychological burden on family caregivers. On the other hand, since patients must forgo curative
care when electing hospice, family members could experience increased burden in informal caregiving and
adverse health outcomes. Prior work on this topic has mostly relied on surveys and smaller samples. This project
aims to provide novel evidence using large administrative data, leveraging a unique dataset that identifies
Medicare beneficiaries who share the same address. This linkage enables researchers to accurately identify
family members who live with AD patients and observe their outcomes using the rich claims and assessment

10953020,"Project Summary/Abstract:
This research proposal responds to the pressing need for comprehensive understanding and targeted support
in breastfeeding outcomes, an area significantly impacting child health and development. Despite the recognized
importance of breastfeeding, existing clinical practices often overlook the intricate interplay of maternal lifestyle
and behavior. Mothers face diverse challenges including return to work, inconsistent milk supply, lack of support,
and postpartum mental stress, all of which profoundly influence breastfeeding success and subsequently, the
well-being of the child. Although national recommendations advocate exclusive breastfeeding for the initial six
months of a child's life, the actual compliance, as reported by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, is
less than 25%. This study takes a digital phenotyping approach by harnessing passive longitudinal monitoring,
facilitated through smartphones, smartwatches, and ecological momentary assessments (EMAs). By examining
physiological components such as sleep, exercise, and vitals through smartwatches, alongside behavioral
patterns encompassing mobility, screen time, and social support via smartphones, we intend to identify lifestyle
factors during the third trimester impacting breastfeeding outcomes. A pivotal aspect of this research lies in its
ability to bridge the existing knowledge gap by delving into the multifaceted aspects of maternal well-being,
mood, lifestyle, mental health, and social support during the critical period of the third trimester to postpartum.
To our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind to focus on breastfeeding outcomes.
We seek to modify and implement a culturally adapted digital phenotyping protocol tailored for first-time mothers.
Through rigorous data collection, encompassing both the objective data from wearables and mobile devices and
subjective self-reports, we aim to understand the nuanced dynamics affecting breastfeeding success. This
research, anchored in innovative technology and supported by a team with extensive expertise in maternal health
and behavioral science, is poised to transform breastfeeding support. By offering novel insights, our findings will
inform future research endeavors and pave the way for personalized interventions, thereby enhancing
breastfeeding success and ultimately contributing to the improved health and development of children."
10953070,"LINE-1 retrotransposons encode a multicistronic enzymatic complex with three open reading frames. Thousands of copies
of LINE-1 are embedded throughout the genome, and the enzyme activity of LINE-1 has generated approximately one third
of the human genome via the insertion of LINE-1 and SINES, another type of retrotransposon that does not encode its own
proteins. Although LINE-1 is largely silenced in most healthy somatic cells, it is reactivated in a large number of diseases
where it is hypothesized to play a role in pathogenesis and disease progression, and some researchers have suggested the
LINE-1 may also have a necessary biological role. Although LINE-1 reactivation can affect cells through multiple
mechanisms, including mutation of genomic DNA, the effects of LINE-1-encoded proteins on LINE-1-associated diseases
have been particularly hard to dissect owing to a lack of reliable knock down models. The lack of reliable knockdown
models arises from i) the large number of LINE-1 copies in the genome, which makes conventional gene editing unfeasible,
including Prime, and ii) the complex and poorly understood interactions and crosstalk between LINE-1, RNAi, and
interferon pathways, which makes the use of shRNA or siRNA difficult to interpret. We propose herein to establish a novel
model to knock down LINE-1 proteins using intracellular functionalized nanobodies, also known as intrabodies. We will
use phage display to isolate nanobodies with high-affinity to LINE-1 proteins from a synthetic nanobody library. These
nanobody sequences will then be fused to GFP or Fboxes to enable live-cell tracking and kinetic experiments (GFP-
nanobodies) or knock down of LINE-1 proteins (Fboxes). Notably, Fbox-nanobody fusions have achieved 100% knockout
of target proteins via rapid ubiquitination through the recruitment of E3 ubiquitin ligase, resulting in proteasomal
degradation. We will then test the ability of these functionalized, LINE-1-specific nanobodies to facilitate live-cell
localization of LINE-1 proteins and to eliminate LINE-1 proteins. We will also perform an initial phenotypic
characterization of cells -/+ knockdown of the LINE-1 protein ORF1p, the most highly expressed LINE-1 protein.
Successful completion of these aims will advance the LINE-1 field and enable more robust hypothesis-testing to determine
the roles of LINE-1 proteins in disease as well as rigorously testing their proposed role in mammalian development."
10948778,"T cells in the brain have long been associated with pathogenic outcomes, with the healthy brain considered an
immune privileged organ. This concept has recently been overturned with the description of meningeal
lymphatics, roles for immune cells in normal brain homeostasis, and detection of T cells in the brains of healthy
subjects and in aging subjects with neurological disease. Why these T cells are in the healthy brain and what
role they play in this critical tissue remain major knowledge gaps. Due to their abnormally hygenic housing
conditions, young adult SPF mice display peripheral immune systems that resemble infant cord blood. In
contrast, signatures of repeated microbial exposure are already evident in children and young adult humans
and these signatures intensify with age. Specific to this proposal, young adult SPF mice, which are the
subjects in many if not most animal models of neuroscience research, have low numbers of T cells in their
brains at homeostasis. Several models have been implemented to “normalize” the peripheral immune system
of inbred SPF mice to better mimic humans. One informative approach, to generate such “dirty mice” leverages
the co-housing (CoH) of SPF mice with pathogen-infested “pet store” mice to permit natural transfer of mouse
pathogens. Alternatively, repeated exposure of SPF mice to known laboratory pathogens (Specific Pathogen
Exposed, SPExp mice) has emerged as a tractable approach that can be used at lower biocontainment than
the CoH approach. Studies with these models have largely focused on understanding how “normalization” of
the immune system influences peripheral immune responses to infection or tumors within lymphoid organs and
barrier tissues. Thus, the impact of repeated microbial exposure on the generation of brain-surveilling T cells is
currently unknown. Our preliminary studies reveal that not only does repeated microbial exposure normalize
the peripheral immune system, it also results in substantial and specific increases in memory CD4 and CD8 T
cell numbers in the brain. In parallel, our preliminary data show here that brain-residing T cells interact with
other immune cells in the CNS, including CD11c+ dendritic cells (DCs), that perform essential functions during
brain homeostasis and in response to brain trauma, infections, tumors, and neurodegeneration. Due to the
heavy reliance on SPF mice for studies of brain function, the consequences having “normalized” populations of
brain-residing memory T cells during homeostasis or neurological disease remain unknown. Our long-term
goal is to exploit models of repeated microbial exposure to “normalize” the immune system and understand the
roles of brain-residing memory T cells in shaping brain function and neuroimmune responses. Specific Aim 1.
Determine how “normalized” numbers of brain-residing CD8 and CD4 T cells impact the functional
status and cellular interactions of brain microglia and CD11c+ DCs at homeostasis. 1.1. Determine the
epigenetic and transcriptomic landscape of myeloid cells in SPF and SPExp mice. 1.2. Visualize the
spatiotemporal dynamics of direct T cell-myeloid interactions in vivo in SPF and SPExp mice."
10950727,"Project Summary/Abstract
The overall goal of this project is to use approaches from statistics and computer science to solve signiﬁcant chal-
lenges in the analysis of metabarcode and metagenomics data. Metagenomics, the study of combined genomes
of organisms present in a single community, is an emerging highly interdisciplinary ﬁeld that combines genomics,
bioinformatics, systems biology, among other areas. Metagenomics has many applications to public health es-
pecially in the areas of pathogen detection, human microbiome analysis, and biodiversity monitoring. The larger
objective of this proposal is to leverage the use of the open source software, tronko, a fast approximate likelihood
phylogenetic placement method that I developed for taxonomic classiﬁcation, which is the ﬁrst phylogenetic place-
ment method that truly enables the use of large-scale reference databases and next generation sequencing data
desired as queries. Tronko will be used to solve fundamental problems in analyses of metabarcode and metage-
nomic data in addition to developing an application to analyses of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequences that will greatly enhance the utility of environmental monitoring of SARS-CoV-2. The
speciﬁc aims of this proposal are to (1) solve an important theoretical problem by applying a rigorous species
delineation to assignment, (2) to apply tronko to solve an important practical problem of estimating the compo-
sition of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in wastewater surveillance samples, and (3) to develop a rapid custom reference
database builder for analyzing metabarcode and metagenomics data. For Aim 1, different phylogenetic groups
have different variability in different parts of the tree, therefore, I plan to use Bayesian methods to estimate effec-
tive population sizes locally to establish appropriate cut-off thresholds for species assignments in different parts
of the phylogeny. Current methods use arbitrary thresholds for delineation of taxonomic groups and this method
would provide an elegant solution to a long-standing limitation in species classiﬁcation. For Aim 2, SARS-CoV-2
monitoring of wastewater is an effective strategy for early detection of outbreaks. I plan to build a pipeline, and
subsequently a web portal for researchers, that uses tronko to ﬁrst detect the virus within a wastewater sample
then subsequently uses an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate the proportions of viral strains. This
aim would greatly aid public health researchers in assessing and managing the pandemic since no established
methods are currently available for this type of analysis. For Aim 3, current custom reference database builders
require weeks if not months of consecutive computational time in addition to access to a large amount of data
storage. I propose to build a method which can be completed within a day. The method will perform in silico
ampliﬁcation of primers and subsequently use the ampliﬁed fragments in a kmer-based approach for identifying
relevant sequences within a nucleotide database with utilization both across a network connection and a local
database. Execution of these aims will solve important theoretical, practical, and computational problems in the
ﬁeld of metagenomics."

Elevated expression of KIF20A, a mitotic kinesin required to promote cytokinesis, the final step of cell division,
is a near-universal feature of human cancer. Increased KIF20A levels are associated with poor prognosis in
multiple tumor types and correlate with chromosomal instability (CIN). Cancer cells are sensitive to loss of
KIF20A function via both small molecule (KIF20Ai) and CRISPR-mediated KIF20A knockout (KIF20A-KO)
whereas RNAi-mediated depletion of KIF20A is generally tolerated and has not informed us of the enzyme’s role
in CIN. We find that increasing KIF20Ai concentrations leads to a dose-dependent loss of viability that correlates
with an increase in mitotic duration caused by defective chromosome congression. While perturbing mitosis is a
clinically relevant therapeutic strategy, current agents target microtubules and induce neurotoxicity, which limits
the utility of these agents and precludes their use in tumors of the central nervous system. Glioblastoma (GBM;
isocitrate dehydrogenase [IDH]-wild-type) is an aggressive, highly proliferative brain tumor with limited treatment
options. Radiotherapy is central to standard of care treatment for GBM. However, refractory cells ultimately lead
to recurrence and highlight the need for new strategies. We and others have shown that perturbing mitosis is a
vulnerability of GBM cells and have demonstrated overexpression of KIF20A in these tumors. Indeed, we find
that patient-derived models of GBM are sensitive to KIF20Ai. In contrast, non-transformed cells have low
sensitivity to KIF20Ai. In addition, as mitotic cells are highly sensitive to radiotherapy, the mitotic arrest induced
by KIF20Ai offers the potential for radiosensitizing these tumors, enhancing the current standard of care. Based
on these observations and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that cancer cells utilize a previously
underappreciated activity of KIF20A to promote efficient mitotic progression and prevent CIN. Furthermore, we
postulate that blocking this function has therapeutic potential. The objective of this proposal is to further
characterize the importance of KIF20A activity in early mitosis and investigate the impact of KIF20Ai as a
potential new therapeutic strategy for GBM. Two Aims are proposed; 1) Define the requirement for KIF20A in
early mitosis by establishing the impact of KIF20A-KO on early mitosis, identifying the essential KIF20A function,
and examining factors that dictate KIF20Ai sensitivity, 2) Determine the impact of KIF20Ai on tumor growth by
comparing KIF20Ai to radiation and testing KIF20Ai as a radiosensitizer in orthotopic GBM PDX models. The
successful completion of this work will provide rationale to further explore 1) the cell biology of KIF20A and
KIF20Ai, to further our understanding of CIN, and identify cellular characteristics and mechanisms that dictate
sensitivity to KIF20Ai, and 2) the preclinical impact and translational potential of KIF20Ai as a non-microtubule-
targeting anti-mitotic strategy, both as a single agent and combination strategy in GBM and other tumor types."
10947653,"Project Summary
 Marginal zone lymphomas (MZL), the second most common subtype of indolent lymphomas, is a B-cell
malignancy where the tumor microenvironment plays an important role in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, it lacks
reliable preclinical models including cell lines, which has hampered rational drug development for this common
indolent lymphoid tumor. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt), mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is one of the frequently deregulated pathways in human cancer and is an essential
component of the B-cell receptor signaling pathway that is important to the pathogenesis of B-cell malignancies.
Interestingly, PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PAM) pathway inhibitors such as copanlisib and capivasertib have shown strong
clinical activity in patients with relapsed or refractory MZL. The tumor suppressor gene (TSG) phosphatase and
tensin homolog (PTEN) negatively regulate PI3K signaling, while the TSG liver kinase B1 (LKB1), also known
as STK11 negatively regulates mTOR signaling. Prior studies using heterozygous global knockout of PTEN and
hypomorphic mutation that decreases LKB1 expression in genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) lead to
formation of indolent lymphomas that were not well characterized, in addition to other types of malignancies such
as pheochromocytomas, prostate, breast and pancreatic carcinomas. Therefore, we have generated novel
GEMM where we have restricted the activation of the PAM pathway to B cells using the Cre/loxP system with
CD19-Cre in order to create a more cell type-specific tumor model and more accurately mimic the underlying
human disease, with the long-term goal of using these models for evaluating targeted and immunotherapies for
human MZL. We will test the following hypotheses: Aim 1: To study the impact of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
activation in the development of marginal zone lymphomas (MZL) using novel genetically engineered
mice. Aim 2: To determine the optimal drug combination for targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in
MZL. These studies will be the first to demonstrate the possibility of modeling human MZL in mice, using a model
with a functional immune system. This novel model will have a tremendous impact on our understanding of the
underlying biology of the disease and on our ability to design future rationale therapies for this incurable
malignancy."

Discovery of disease modifying therapy for the prevention and treatment of glaucoma

UNTHSC
Abstract: Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss and blindness in the world affecting 80
million individuals worldwide. Current glaucoma treatments are directed at lowering intraocular pressure (IOP),
the main risk factor for the development and progression of glaucoma. While these pharmaceutical or surgical
therapies may slow vision loss, the majority of glaucoma patients continue to lose vision. Also, IOP lowering
treatments do not directly address the underlying glaucomatous damage to the eye, making patients
increasingly resistant to therapy over time. There is a definite need to discover better ways to treat glaucoma,
including new disease modifying therapies that directly intervene and prevent glaucomatous damage to the
eye. Our research has focused on discovering the molecular mechanisms responsible for this glaucomatous
damage, and we recently discovered intersecting pathogenic signaling pathways (TGFβ2/BMP/GREM1) that
damage the front of the eye causing IOP elevation and the back of the eye causing optic nerve degeneration.
Based on this pathogenic mechanism discovery, we will employ new computational pharmacological
approaches to identify novel agents that will interfere with the GREM1-BMP protein-protein interaction (PPI),
using 3D molecular dynamics modeling of GREM1-BMP2/4 structures to allow for in silico screening of an
extensive library of small molecules for potential PPI inhibitors (Specific Aim #1a). We then will screen these
candidate inhibitors using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding assays (Specific Aim #1b), trabecular
meshwork cell culture assays (Specific Aim 2), and in vivo mouse ocular hypertension assays (Specific Aim
#3) to identify, refine, and validate these drug candidates as new glaucoma disease modifying therapies. This
cutting-edge research will lead to the first of its kind therapy to directly intervene in the glaucomatous disease
process leading to glaucoma pathology."
10947431,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Objective: The purpose of this application is to identify a rate of normative cognitive aging (i.e., cognitive aging
in individuals without a neurocognitive disorder), and determine how much quicker cognitive aging is among
individuals living with Alzheimer disease or related dementias (AD/ADRD). Using data from the Children of the
Depression (CODA) cohort of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), we will first identify a latent variable
estimate of general cognitive performance (Aim 1). Afterwards, we will identify the pace of normative cognitive
aging in standard deviations per year (SD/year), both unadjusted and adjusted for known covariables that
influence cognition (e.g., age, sex, race and ethnicity, education; Aim 2). Finally, we will use Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) data linked to the HRS to identify participants who receive a dementia
diagnosis during follow-up, and determine how much faster cognitive aging is among individuals living with
AD/ADRD (Aim 3). In line with PAR-23-179, this proposal will also develop the career for early-stage
investigator, Dr. Kunicki, and will serve as a basis for future NIH grant proposals.
Significance: Cognitive ability declines with age, and tends to aging quicker later in life. Whereas
neurocognitive disorders such AD/ADRD are known to increase the rate of cognitive aging, there is no well-
established reference of normative cognitive aging. Lacking this reference pace makes it difficult for
researchers to evaluate the results of their studies (i.e., determining if a cohort is declining at a normal or
quicker than usual pace). Moreover, we will estimate how much quicker cognitive aging is among individuals
living with AD/ADRD.
Approach: We will use data from the CODA cohort of the HRS, which is comprised of over 2,000 participants
aged 68-74 at baseline with 22 years of follow-up data available. Using the HRS cognitive measures, we will
identify a latent variable of cognitive aging, and use the latent variable to identify the pace of normative
cognitive aging in SD/year. Then, using CMS data, we will identify participants who received a dementia
diagnosis during follow-up and determine how much faster cognitive aging is among individuals living with
AD/ADRD. Sensitivity analyses will also examine the pace of normative cognitive aging by different cognitive
domains.
Innovation: This study is innovative because it addresses a major gap in the literature in cognitive aging by
identifying a pace of normative cognitive aging and among individuals living with AD/DARD. These paces will
be useful for researchers to use as reference points to interpret results of clinical trials to slow cognitive aging.
Despite a lack of normative cognitive aging rates being a well-known issue in the field of aging, this study will
be the first to identify a nationally representative rate of cognitive aging among older adults."
10946923,"The opioid crisis is a pressing global issue, highlighting the need for exploring new targets with unique
mechanisms of action. Extracellular adenosine is known to relieve pain by activating adenosine A1 receptors
(A1R). However, the development of synthetic A1R agonists for pain relief has been hampered by challenges
such as side effects or tolerance. Therefore, a novel strategy for A1R activation is imperative. Equilibrative
nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1), the main cellular adenosine transporter, offers a potential avenue. By inhibiting
ENT1, extracellular adenosine concentrations will increase, potentially leading to analgesic effects through A1R
activation in primary sensory neurons. This concept mirrors monoamine reuptake inhibitors used for
neuromodulation. Based on the crystal structure of human ENT1 in complex with a clinical inhibitor dilazep, we
modified dilazep. Our modified inhibitor, termed JH-ENT-01, has shown analgesic efficacy in an animal model
of neuropathic pain, unlike dilazep. This indicates ENT1 as a potential neuropathic pain target, and the rational
design of ENT1 inhibitors may be a promising pathway for neuropathic pain treatment. Our logical next steps
are to validate ENT1’s role in neuropathic pain, to understand the mechanism of our new ENT1 inhibitor, and to
develop in vitro screening methods. We have three aims: 1) In vivo validation of ENT1 as a novel target for
neuropathic pain; 2) In vitro and ex vivo characterization of ENT1 inhibitors; 3) Development and improvement
of in vitro assays. We have assembled a diverse, multidisciplinary team to achieve these aims. Our findings
during this funding period will form the foundation for a subsequent U19 application (RFA-NS-22-052) with the
following four components: 1) Validation of Therapeutic Target and Underlying Biology; 2) Development and
Validation of Animal Models and/or Outcome Measures; 3) Assay Development, Screening, and Early
Optimization; 4) Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) and Efficacy Studies. Addressing the issue of
neuropathic pain is important, and our work will deepen our understanding of the role of nucleoside transporters
in pain modulation, paving the way for developing non-addictive pain medication in the future."

Posttranslational arginylation on proteins installed by arginyltransferase ATE1 is a critical modification for cancer
progression and metastasis. ATE1 is a beneficiary regulator, inhibition of which often results in elevated
metastasis (e.g., prostate cancer) and poorer outcomes. Unfortunately, the physiological roles of ATE1 (and its
arginylation activity) in cancers remain poorly understood, mostly due to the lack of analytical methods to
discover the protein substrates of ATE1 from cancer samples. Arginylation regulates protein half-lives in cellular
systems through the Arg/N-degron pathway and represents one of the three (arginine, proline, and acetylation)
N-terminal degradation signals (N-degrons) for protein turnover. Here, we aim to discover the protein substrates
of ATE1 in cancers for the development of targeted protein degradation (TPD) by hijacking ATE1 and its
arginylation activity. We have developed an unbiased proteomic profiling method to discover the ATE1
substrates and their precise arginylation sites, the method is termed activity-based arginylation profiling
(ABAP). Using ABAP, we have successfully profiled arginylation from 12 samples including 4 cancer cell lines.
In this proposal, we would like to establish a library of cancerous substrates from commonly used cancer cell
lines using the NCI60 pellets. To take advantage of arginylation for targeted protein degradation against cancers,
we have engaged ATE1 with protein of interest (POI) through our model Halo-FKBP system. We discovered, for
the first time, that engagement of ATE1 with cancer targets (e.g., SHOC2 and RAD52) successfully induced POI
degradation in cellular models. We termed this technology arginylation targeting chimera (ArgTAC). Our
preliminary data on degradation data from the first few POIs encouraged us to further develop this technology
as a novel approach in the TPD field. We will apply a series of state-of-the-art approaches including proteomics
and molecular biology to characterize the mechanism of action of induced POI degradation after engagement
with ATE1. A series of molecular events will be characterized including cellular proximity between ATE1 and
POI, the arginylation and polyubiquitination of POI, and the POI degradation dependency on UBR E3 ligases
and proteasome. To achieve optimal degradation of broad cancer targets, we will expand our tool compounds
designed for the Halo-FKBP system. We will also further develop new ATE1 binders/recruiters through peptide
optimization based on LIAT1 (ligand of ATE1) binding domain to ATE1 using screening and structure/computer
modeling-based drug discovery. More ArgTACs targeting other POIs will be synthesized and tested for
degradation activities in cell models to expand the application of ArgTACs. The proposed ABAP and ArgTAC
platform here will likely generate a catalog of oncoproteins regulated by arginylation, and offer a general and
revolutionary TPD technology targeting oncoprotein degradation as a therapeutic strategy for cancers."

Recently, our lab developed a novel immune therapeutic approach delivering TT as a neoantigen surrogate
selectively into tumors by Listeria infection in vivo, which attracts pre-existing TT-specific memory T cells
(generated earlier in life during childhood vaccinations) now killing the highly immunogenic tumor cells. This has
been published last year in Science Transl Med. Our ultimate goal is to test this promising therapy in patients
with advanced pancreatic cancer. Although Listeria has been tested for 15 years in cancer patients this was
always through intravenous (iv) injections. In previous studies we found that Listeria needs to be injected
intraperitoneally (ip), in order to reach the tumor (Listeria is immediately eliminated in the blood through immune
clearance). However, ip injections of Listeria has never been done before in patients. Therefore, we developed
a tool that visualizes Listeria in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET) scan, i.e. we uploaded Listeria-TT
with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). FDG is a glucose analogue, transported into the cell through glucose
transporters (GLUTs), and then phosphorylated by hexokinases (HXKs) to FDG-6-phosphate, which become
stored in the cell, resulting in a positive FDG signal measurable by PETscan. This methodology is normally used
to visualize tumors in vivo. However, here we don’t want FDG signal in tumors but in the Listeria, to monitor
Listeria in vivo. It is known that Listeria transports glucose through via PEP (phosphoenolpyruvate) and PTS
(phosphotransferase system). Starvation of Listeria-TT bacteria in saline, followed by incubation of the Listeria-
TT with FDG (up to 5 mCi) in vitro, and a washing step to eliminate the free FDG (supernatant), resulted in highly
radioactive Listeria-TT without killing the Listeria bacteria. More importantly, Listeria-TT-FDG was visible in
tumors and metastases by PET/CT without background in normal tissues within 1hr after ip injection. Our results
suggest that further improvement is possible (higher doses of FDG, different incubation times, and monitoring).
This allows us to monitor the distribution of Listeria in vivo which will answer several questions such as whether
Listeria accumulates in tumors and metastases only (like in mice), at what time points do we see the highest
number of Listeria in correlation with tumor size, what is the sensitivity of the methodology. In preclinical studies
we found that Listeria is only visible in tumors (immune suppressive, allowing the Listeria to survive) and
metastases and not normal tissues (lacks immune suppression, Listeria will be immediately eliminated), raising
the question can we use Listeria-TT-FDG to determine the success of therapy or diagnosis? Thus, the main
goal of this proposal is to finetune the Listeria-TT-FDG for human application. To reach our goal the spec aims
are as follow.
Aim 1: Characterizing Listeria-TT-FDG in vitro.
Aim 2: Testing Listeria-TT-FDG in different mouse models of pancreatic cancer (Panc-02 and KPC)."
10949005,"Satisfaction of Search (SOS), where an abnormality is missed after a previous abnormality was found, is a
pervasive problem across different types of images, yet their impact on breast cancer detection is un-
known. Radiology and cognitive science have independently investigated why, how, and when SOS oc-
curs. The objectives of this grant are to bridge cognitive science research techniques with radiology to de-
termine: 1) the neural underpinnings of SOS, 2) the extent to which SOS affects breast cancer detection,
3) the extent to which advancements in imaging technology alleviates SOS, and 4) how expertise affects
SOS error rates. My central hypothesis is SOS contributes to breast cancer misses because a found ab-
normality becomes an attentional template. An attentional template is known in cognitive science as an
enhanced representation of a target maintained within memory and biases attention in search. The ra-
tionale for this project is when a first target is detected, it becomes an attentional template that utilizes and
biases attention necessary for detecting subsequent targets making searchers prone to SOS. However,
SOS may be mitigated: 1) by changing search strategies to counteract a first target becoming an atten-
tional template, 2) with advances in imaging technology, and 3) with expertise in breast cancer detection.
These influences need to be investigated to determine the extent to which they can alleviate SOS. This
work will pursue four specific aims to test the central hypothesis: 1) identify a mechanistic account for
SOS, 2) determine the extent to which SOS accounts for breast cancer misses, 3) compare SOS between
mammography and tomosynthesis, and 4) compare SOS error rates between different levels of expertise.
The research proposed is innovative because it will: 1) identify a mechanism responsible for SOS; 2) use
EEG and eye-tracking to study the neural basis of SOS; 3) use realistic, virtual breast images to investi-
gate the extent to which SOS affects breast cancer detection; 4) determine the extent to which the SOS
results from simplified search displays replicate in realistic-looking medical images; 5) be the first time
SOS is investigated with 3D imaging; and 6) determine the extent to which SOS rates vary by expertise in
breast cancer detection. The proposed research is significant because: 1) it will develop a neural under-
standing of how SOS contributes to cancer detection; 2) determine how SOS varies across different
search modalities and by expertise; and 3) ultimately improve breast cancer detection by determining how
these influences impact SOS rates. To complete the proposed research, in pursuit of his long-term goal of
becoming an independent researcher at a Tier-I institution, the PI will train using EEG and eye-tracking.
His training will include auditing graduate courses, attending workshops, weekly meetings/training with his
mentors, and bi-annual assessments of his EEG/eye-tracking expertise with his mentors."

 This proposal describes a career development program to prepare Dr. Lu for an independent research career
that focuses on developing computational and experimental methods to improve cancer detection, diagnosis,
and treatment. This program will provide Dr. Lu with new expertise in single-cell spatial omics, integrating with
her background in machine learning-based image computation (gained as a graduate student) and clinical single-
cell drug imaging (gained as a postdoctoral researcher) to advance our understanding of the mechanism that
drives drug resistance of pancreatic cancer. Dr. Lu will be mentored by Dr. Garry Nolan, who invented the
CODEX technology for highly multiplexed single-cell imaging, and co-mentored by Dr. Eben Rosenthal, a
physician-scientist who pioneered the first-in-human clinical studies for fluorescence-guided cancer surgery, and
Dr. Robert West, who developed the Smart-3SEQ technology for spatial transcriptomics. The K99 phase of Dr.
Lu’s training will consist of (i) structured mentorship by the primary mentor and co-mentors, (ii) close interactions
with advisory committee and collaborators, (iii) technical and academic training, (iv) a provocative research
project, and (v) a program of career transition.
 Elucidating the role of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in drug resistance is critical to developing effective
cancer therapies, but quantifying the drug delivery and action together with host environment factors within
clinical tumors remains technically challenging. Antibody-based therapeutics, such as antibody-drug conjugates
(ADCs) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), are especially susceptible to blockade by TME barriers. The
overall objective of this project is to identify the TME factors driving drug resistance in pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by integrating single-cell geospatial mapping of therapeutic antibodies with the deep
spatial profiling of the TME. The central hypothesis is that periostin and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)
play a key role in inhibiting drug delivery and response in PDAC. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing
three aims: (Aim 1) establish a computational spatial omics platform by integrating CODEX and Smart-3SEQ to
chart the baseline architecture of PDAC TME in an unbiased way; (Aim 2) combine single-cell drug imaging with
spatial omics to determine the impact of stromal barriers to antibody delivery into PDAC and evaluate whether
inhibiting periostin improves the delivery of anti-EGFR antibodies and ADCs in patient-derived xenograft mouse
models; and (Aim 3) examine the role of chemotherapy in altering the phenotype and function of TAMs in human
and mouse PDAC; identify chemo-induced alterations in TAM-ICI interactions in PDAC patients infused with a
fluorescent anti-PD-L1 antibody; and validate whether inhibiting TAM-ICI interactions improves response to ICI
plus chemotherapy in a transgenic mice model of PDAC. This project will provide novel computational tools to
quantify cell-cell and cell-drug interactions in clinical tumors, offer new mechanistic insights on drug resistance
in pancreatic cancer, and lead to new treatment strategies to improve patient survival."

While over 90% of patients with metastatic prostate cancer respond to systemic therapies that block androgen
receptor signaling, nearly all of these patients will eventually relapse and die due to development of acquired
therapy resistance. Thus, strategies to prevent acquired therapy resistance are needed. We have identified a
rare molecular subtype of prostate cancer with isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation that fails to acquire
resistance to therapy. This exploratory proposal will investigate mechanisms by which IDH1-mutant prostate
cancer fails to acquire resistance to therapy with a goal to identify novel therapeutic targets to prevent resistance.
Molecular consequences of IDH1 mutation in cancer have been previously studied in AML and glioma where it
has been shown that IDH1 mutation leads to accumulation of R-2HG, inhibition of 2OG dioxygenases, increased
DNA and histone methylation, and marked alteration of epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. However,
AML and glioma are different from most solid tumors including prostate cancer because they do not metastasize
and have unique treatment paradigms. We will test the hypothesis that IDH1-mutant prostate cancer is restricted
in epigenetic control of gene transcription, rendering it less able to adapt to stress such as therapy, and that
inhibition of a 2OG-dioxygenase(s) enhances response to therapy. In Aim 1 we will study the largest cohort of
patients with IDH1-mutant prostate cancer to date to describe clinical, genomic, and transcriptomic features of
this disease. Aim 2 is to develop a transgenic murine model of IDH1-mt prostate cancer to study mechanisms of
therapy resistance and sensitivity in vivo. In Aim 3, we will perform a targeted CRISPR-KO screen to identify
2OG-dioxygenases that upon deletion increase DNA methylation and therapy sensitivity in prostate cancer.
Together, these aims will provide insight into molecular consequences of IDH1 mutation in prostate cancer and
may identify novel drug targets to disable epigenetic plasticity required for acquired resistance to therapy."

Obesity is a leading cause of health disparities in the general population, being associated with increased risk of
breast cancer, decreased response to treatment and higher rates of cancer-associated mortality. Women with a
germline mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 have a 4-7-times increased risk of developing breast cancer compared
to the general population. We have discovered that body mass index (BMI) and poor metabolic health is
associated with more DNA damage in the non-tumor breast glands of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.
DNA damage is credited for the development of cancer from non-cancer cells. In fact, our studies in mice
demonstrate that more mice develop tumors when they are obese (compared to lean) and that these develop at
a younger age. We now have evidence that having a mutation in BRCA may predispose to poor metabolic health,
leading to a potential vicious cycle whereby increased cancer risk may be in part driven by detrimental effects of
BRCA mutations in metabolic tissues, including the liver, adipose tissue, pancreas and muscle.
We hypothesize that carrying a BRCA mutation leads to defects in mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell, in
metabolic tissues, leading to poor metabolic health and increased cancer risk.
This study aims to:
 1) Understand the mechanism of impaired metabolic health in mice with loss of Brca1
 2) Determine if carrying a mutation in BRCA affects biomarkers of metabolic health in women
These studies will determine whether additional follow up related to metabolic health should be considered after
a BRCA diagnosis. By also exploring metabolic targets, this project has the potential to identify risk reduction
strategies for BRCA mutation carriers for whom standard of care remains prophylactic surgery."
10949012,"Project Summary Abstract
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is estimated to result in 76,080 new cases and 13,780 deaths in 2021. Clear cell
renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common subtype of RCC (>75% of RCC patients) and is
characterized by a high vascularized tumor microenvironment (TME). Anti- angiogenic and vascular
normalization (VN) inducing therapies are initially effective, almost all patients develop resistance to these
therapies. Therefore, there is a need to identify alternative fundamental therapies for ccRCC. Our lab and
others have demonstrated that actin cytoskeleton plays a key role in regulation of vascular endothelial cell
(VEC) in angiogenesis and barrier function. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that Profilin1 (Pfn1) is an
important regulator of actin-driven processes such as cell migration and proliferation (including in VEC,
affecting angiogenic potential). Pfn1 is also overexpressed in human ccRCC and higher expression of Pfn1
has been linked to poor clinical outcome and advanced disease features. The goal of this study is to further
demonstrate Pfn1’s fundamental role in regulation of progression of ccRCC through modulation of tumor-
promoted vascularization and that Pfn1 serves as a therapeutic target for RCC. Our preliminary data
demonstrates that overexpressed Pfn1 is primarily found in tumor-associated VEC (TAEC). We further
demonstrate that loss of Pfn1 by genetic deletion in vivo or inhibition of Pfn1 by small molecule inhibitor
reduces aberrant vascularization in various pathological settings (including retina and kidney) and attenuates
RCC progression in vivo. Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to test a postulate that endothelial Pfn1 promotes a pro-
tumorigenic TME driving tumor progression in ccRCC and can be diminished by tumor-localized delivery of
novel small molecule antagonist of Pfn1-actin interaction. Aim 2 of this proposal will test a postulate that Pfn1
regulates the intrinsic angiogenic capability of VEC through augmenting mitochondrial function. Aim 3 tests a
postulate that VEC-secreted Pfn1 acts as a paracrine signaling mediator to promote ccRCC aggressiveness.
Aims 1 and 2 will mostly be performed in the K99 mentored stage, during which I will continue my training in
contrast-enabled ultrasound, immuno-, and mitochondrial biology. These trainings will be pivotal in my
transition to independence in the R00 stage where Aim 3 and the rest of Aim 2 will be executed."

In this renewal SPORE application, the former Biostatistics and Data Management Core is renamed to 
better reflect our expanded services. We have considerable experience working as a team with groups of 
investigators in general and this group of SPORE investigators in particular. All projects in our SPORE 
application will require statistical support for a range of preclinical and clinical experiments. All three projects
propose clinical trials, and we have a strong track record of electronic clinical trial data management for both 
small single institution trials and more complex randomized multi-institution trials. All projects will also benefit 
from our expanded support for bioinformatics and integrative proteogenomic analysis. We also provide data 
management support to Core 1 (Pathology and Biobanking). New informatic development in support of 
biobanking and clinical annotation, undertaken and cost shared with several other large projects is a significant 
benefit to the SPORE. 
In our experience, centralized quantitative science support ensures that the biostatisticians, 
bioinformaticians and informatics professionals are completely familiar with all aspects of the Projects and 
Cores. This provides continuity, increases efficiency, and ensures that appropriate methods are applied. This 
also increases cross-Project data sharing. The Informatics and Statistics Core (ISC) will provide three broad 
types of services: (1) Comprehensive biostatistical consultation, experimental design, data analysis and 
reporting; (2) Integrative proteome-genomic bioinformatic consultation, experimental design, data analysis and 
reporting; (3) Development, customization, integration and maintenance of databases and data management 
systems to support data management needs of SPORE projects and cores. As a by-product, when necessary, 
the Core can also develop new methods or adapt existing methods from other arenas to meet the unique needs 
of the SPORE.
The SPORE benefits greatly from having a dedicated and experienced team with a range of skills. The 
Core can also draw flexibly on the resources and personnel in the Cancer Center Biostatistics and Informatics 
Shared Resource and the Zhang Lab to augment expertise, or alter access to resources as needs change. 
Sample size considerations, experimental designs, and overviews of planned analyses for all projects were 
prepared in collaboration with the Core. In addition, deep understanding of SPORE data and analysis needs, in 
turn, drives database and application development, ensuring that informatic solutions meet the broad, as well as 
project-specific, needs of the SPORE. A hallmark of SPOREs is flexibility to terminate futile studies and pursue 
new leads. With dedicated Core personnel, we can also help investigators design new studies and test new 
hypotheses that may arise by cross-fertilization of these related projects."
10913365,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a risk factor for adverse outcomes in critically ill children, including prolonged 
hospitalization, disability, and death. AKI is particularly significant for children with sepsis, a medical emergency 
due to life-threatening organ dysfunction from infection that affects over 72,000 children in the US and four million 
children worldwide each year. Children with sepsis-induced AKI and acute kidney disease (AKD, persistent 
kidney dysfunction of <90 days duration) may also be at risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Specific risk 
factors for AKI and CKD among children with sepsis remain poorly defined and, importantly, gaps remain in 
identifying the best therapies to prevent sepsis-induced AKI, AKD, and CKD. Crystalloid fluid, the cornerstone of 
resuscitation for septic shock, has key biological effects on kidney function. Emerging data in adults suggest that 
resuscitation with 0.9% “normal” saline (NS) is more likely to induceAKI and AKD compared to resuscitation with 
balanced fluids (BF). Few data on the impact of fluid resuscitation on kidney function in children exist. In this 
study, we will perform an ancillary study to the PRagMatic Pediatric Trial of Balanced vs. nOrmaL saline flUid in 
Sepsis (PRoMPT BOLUS) randomized clinical trial. That trial is randomizing children in emergency departments
with suspected septic shock to fluid resuscitation with either NS or BF. The trial will determine the comparative 
effectiveness of different crystalloids on 30-day kidney function and death in children with suspected septic 
shock. However, data on outcomes such as AKI or CKD will not be collected in direct follow-up of trial 
participants. A remaining knowledge gap after trial completion will therefore be whether BF resuscitation in 
pediatric sepsis protects against AKI and translates to a decrease in CKD. To assess these important kidney 
outcomes, we will use the Pediatric Center of Excellence in Nephrology (PCEN) Learning Health System Core
to link clinical trial data to electronic health record data available in PEDSnet (pedsnet.org) to augment trial 
outcome analyses. The primary objectives of this study are to: 1) assess whether resuscitation with BF instead 
of NS will decrease AKI and translate to a decrease in CKD in trial participants, and 2) measure the real-world 
impact of crystalloid fluid choice on sepsis-induced AKI and CKD in the larger PEDSnet source population. To 
achieve these objectives, we will utilize electronic health record data in PEDSnet to measure AKI and CKD in 
2,450 children enrolled in the PRoMPT BOLUS study at 7 trial sites. To demonstrate generalizability of trial 
results using a real-world comparison, we will determine the impact of crystalloid fluid exposure on AKI and CKD 
in a broader cohort of over 16,600 children in PEDSnet presenting to an ED for treatment of septic shock using 
a quasi-experimental observational study design. We will also determine other risk factors for progression from 
AKI to AKD to CKD in children with sepsis. This proposal aligns with the PCEN goal to facilitate extensive 
collaborative research around the causes, diagnosis, and treatment of kidney diseases in children with increased 
efficiency and NIDDK’s mission to evaluate treatments to prevent the development of kidney disease."
10895392,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Suicide is inherently an affectively charged topic and clinicians often experience anxiety and low self-efficacy in 
detecting and intervening with those at risk. This anxiety leads to poor implementation of evidence-based suicide 
screening, assessment, and interventions (SSAIs). Clinician anxiety and low self-efficacy related to SSAI use 
are thus candidate targets for implementation strategy design to optimize SSAI uptake in diverse mental health 
settings. This exploratory project brings together an interdisciplinary team to leverage decades of research on 
behavior change from exposure theory to design and pilot-test an exposure-based implementation strategy 
(EBIS) to target clinician-level anxiety about SSAI use. We will test the effect of EBIS as an implementation 
strategy to augment Implementation as Usual (IAU) to enhance SSAI implementation in community mental health 
settings. Specifically, Aim 1 will use participatory design methods to develop and refine EBIS in collaboration 
with a stakeholder advisory board of clinicians, administrators, and content experts. In Aim 2, we will further 
iteratively refine EBIS with up to 15 clinicians in a pilot field test, using rapid cycle prototyping, in collaboration 
with the INSPIRE Methods Core. Clinicians in Aim 2 will also provide qualitative feedback on EBIS’ ability to 
mitigate anxiety and increase self-efficacy to deliver SSAIs to optimize our ability to engage target mechanisms 
of clinician anxiety. Aim 3 will test the refined EBIS in a pilot implementation trial in which 40 community mental 
health clinicians will be randomized to receive either IAU or EBIS+IAU. Primary Aim 3 dependent variables are 
EBIS acceptability and feasibility, measured through questionnaires, interviews, and recruitment and retention 
statistics; this pilot trial is not intended to be powered to detect effects. Secondary outcomes are preliminary 
effectiveness of EBIS on implementation outcomes (SSAI adoption and fidelity), and engagement of target 
implementation mechanisms (clinician anxiety and self-efficacy related to SSAI use), assessed via mixed 
methods (questionnaires, chart-stimulated recall, observer-coded role plays, and interviews). We have two 
exploratory hypotheses, which we will evaluate via mixed methods: (1) EBIS will engage target implementation 
mechanisms by lowering anxiety and increasing self-efficacy better than IAU; (2) Clinicians randomized to EBIS 
will show improved SSAI adoption and fidelity. We also will gather data on other possible implementation 
mechanisms using questionnaires and qualitative interviews to probe for contextual implementation barriers to 
SSAI use not addressed by EBIS to inform augmentation prior to fully powered evaluation.
This project addresses a major gap in the implementation of suicide prevention evidence-based practices by 
developing a novel implementation strategy to augment IAU that targets mutable implementation mechanisms 
unique to SSAI use. Study goals are consistent with NIMH research priorities and aligned with the overall mission 
of INSPIRE. Results will inform a fully powered R01 to test EBIS’ effect on implementation and patient outcomes."
10949082,"Project Summary
 While the 5-year survival rate for colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with localized stage disease (as defined
by SEER) is 90%, this survival rate drops to 14% for patients diagnosed with metastatic CRC. Thus, there is an
urgent need to define the mechanisms governing progression to advanced disease and its maintenance.
 Human CRCs harboring oncogenic mutations in the KRAS oncogene (designated hereafter as KRAS*) are
25% more likely to develop metastases. Similarly, our CRC mouse model, engineered with an inducible KRAS*
transgene and conditional null alleles of APC and p53 alleles (iKAP), has revealed a role for KRAS* in driving
cancer progression and metastasis. Mechanistically, KRAS*-driven cancer metastasis functions in part by
activating cancer cell-intrinsic TGFβ signaling and suppressing anti-tumoral immunity via the IRF2-CXCL3 axis
which recruits myeloid derived suppressor cells. Unfortunately, emerging therapies targeting either KRAS* or
TGFβ pathways have shown limited efficacy in the clinic, motivating us to identify and validate additional
KRAS*-driven cancer progression mechanisms with the goal of expanding the repertoire of therapeutic targets
for metastatic CRC. Utilizing the iKAP model, functional gene set enrichment and histological analyses of
KRAS*-expressing CRC metastases revealed a strong adipogenesis signature and preponderance of
lipofibroblasts and angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment. Correspondingly, co-culture of mouse
embryonic fibroblasts with conditioned media from iKAP primary cell lines stimulated their differentiation into
cells with adipocyte and fibroblast traits, i.e., “lipofibroblasts.” In the F99 phase of this proposal, I seek to define
the molecular mechanisms by which KRAS*-expressing cancer cells drive lipofibrogenesis and to understand the
tumor biological role of lipofibroblasts in KRAS*-driven CRC progression.
 As only a minority of human or mouse KRAS* CRC cases progress to metastatic disease, clearly genetic
events beyond KRAS activation drive metastases. For example, patients with or without KRAS* mutation both
show around a 40% lymph node metastatic rate. The study of such pro-metastasis events would be greatly
facilitated by incorporating an inducible telomerase reverse transcriptase (LSL-mTERT) into our existing iAP
model, thus modeling telomere-based crisis and genome instability followed by telomerase reactivation. In our
telomerase-inducible mouse models of prostate cancer, crisis-telomerase sequence generates cancer-relevant
genomic aberrations and increases metastatic potential. Although incorporation of genomic instability into the
iAP model would not create a more human-like model, it would provide a platform to identify amplifications and
deletions associated with the metastatic process. In the K00 phase of this proposal, I seek to engineer human-
like telomere dynamics in the iAP model to assess the impact of telomere-based crisis and telomerase
reactivation in driving metastasis and to survey the genomic alterations that may underlie the metastatic process.
Such efforts may facilitate the discovery of new therapeutic targets for advanced CRC disease."
10948943,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) comprises the majority of preterm births (60%) and is a leading case of
newborn morbidity and death and a predictor of adverse health outcomes. Despite its high prevalence, there is
a limited understanding of how the in-utero environment contributes to the etiology of sPTB. Phthalates are
ubiquitous endocrine disrupting chemicals that induce gene expression and physiological changes within the
placenta. Epidemiological studies identify a consistent positive relationship between prenatal phthalate exposure
and preterm birth. The goal of this study is to develop placental molecular signatures that can be used to
mechanistically link prenatal phthalate exposure and sPTB. Placental molecular signatures can explain
functional differences related to sPTB and identify targets for clinical and therapeutic interventions, including
modifiable risk factors such as environmental exposures. Our research team has generated the largest placental
transcriptomics dataset to date (N=760 samples) and has used this to develop transcriptomic signatures of
prenatal phthalate exposure and sPTB. This study will expand our existing transcriptomic signatures to include
microRNAs, which are essential to a complete molecular signature because they are highly stable, have been
linked to a number of environmental exposures, and are secreted into maternal circulation where they may serve
as biomarkers. Candidate microRNA studies have identified correlations between prenatal phthalate exposure
and expression of placental microRNAs, but a comprehensive assessment is needed to fully understand the role
of placental microRNAs in phthalate mediated toxicity. Moreover, despite the potential importance of placental
microRNAs as a biomarker of sPTB, there has not been a comprehensive analysis. In this proposal, we seek to
fill these research gaps and apply innovative computational biology strategies with rigorous epidemiological
approaches to gain insight into the mechanistic links between prenatal phthalate exposure, placental function,
and sPTB. In aim 1, we will generate microRNA data on placental samples and use this to generate a signature
of prenatal phthalate exposure. We will use the matched microRNA-mRNA sequencing data to construct a global
placental microRNA-mRNA network, which we will apply to identify connections between microRNAs and genes
whose placenta expression is associated with different phthalate metabolites. In Aim two, we will develop a multi-
omic molecular signature of sPTB using our placental microRNA-mRNA network. In aim 3, we will examine the
role of the placenta as a mechanistic link between prenatal phthalate exposure and sPTB by interdisciplinary
strategies including an integrated pathway analysis and a formal mediation analysis. Findings from this study
will inform chemical toxicological risk assessment and policy to reduce health impacts due to phthalate exposure
in pregnancy. microRNA signatures of sPTB may serve as functional biomarkers of sPTB since they can be
secreted into maternal circulation and be targets for clinical and therapeutic intervention in the future."

Our overarching goal is to identify and assess policy and community-level interventions that counteract the
effects of SRD within neighborhoods, schools, and peer networks, on adolescent substance use and mental
health outcomes. We will leverage data from The Context Study, a large (n= 7,174), seven wave panel study of
public-school children in three racially diverse, predominantly rural counties in North Carolina. At wave one, all
6th, 7th, and 8th graders attending a public school in the three counties were eligible; the final wave occurred
when participants were in 10th-12th grade. Context includes extensive panel data on peer networks and
comprehensive residential geocodes for participants. We have linked these data to students’ school and criminal
records, Census, county tax-value property assessments, Google Maps, and the American Community Survey
to construct measures of SRD. Guided by the NC State Health Improvement Plan to increase health equity and
empirical evidence, we will use Context data, group model building, and an agent-based model (ABM) to project
the long-term impact of policy and community-level interventions (e.g., resource distribution, social integration,
and school discipline policies) that target SRD and its consequences on adolescent substance use and mental
health. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: Develop a detailed theoretical model of the systems rooted in SRD that
drive adolescent substance use and mental health outcomes and determine how these may be addressed
through policy and community-level interventions. We will use a community-based systems dynamics approach
to convene a group model building workshop with diverse community stakeholders to develop a causal loop
diagram of the system and identify a set of community co-created candidate policy and community-level
interventions that could modify the system and reduce the impact of SRD. Aim 2: Use ABM to compare the
expected long-term outcomes of various types and combinations of candidate policy and community-level
interventions to address SRD and its effects on adolescent substance use and mental health. We will use
information from the group model building workshops and leverage national models and a representative
synthetic population to develop an ABM to examine spatial and temporal effects of SRD on adolescent health.
We will validate the model on Context data, conduct sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of model
results to uncertainty in model structures and parameters, and project the impact of candidate interventions. Aim
3: Determine key implementation factors of candidate policy and community-level interventions. For selected
interventions, we will conduct focus groups and in-depth interviews with community stakeholders to gain insight
on implementation factors including feasibility, acceptability, and scalability. We will analyze these data and
develop intervention maps of the most promising candidate interventions. Identifying and projecting systems-
level interventions that disrupt adolescent exposure to SRD has strong potential to move the field beyond
individually focused solutions and ultimately support strategies to reduce adolescent health inequities."
10947149,"Diffuse midline glioma (DMG) is a lethal pediatric brain tumor without a cure and with a poor prognosis. The H3K27M mutation is present in 80% of DMG patients and is the primary driver of the disease. Therefore, targeting this oncohistone using mRNA-based gene therapies may represent a promising treatment option. However, mRNA as a drug needs to overcome the blood-brain and blood-tumor barriers to reach the tumor site, which is difficult due to the location of DMG in the brain stem. During my postdoctoral fellowship, I have developed non- toxic lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that can effectively deliver mRNA to DMG tumors in vivo. This proposal aims to further optimize and evaluate the efficacy of these LNPs in delivering mRNA, explore the mechanism behind their delivery, and develop a new therapeutic approach targeting the H3K27M gene in DMG. In Aim 1, I will test the delivery of mRNA with different bases modifications and LNP chemistries to maximize LNP transfection and protein translation in DMG mouse models. In Aim 2, I will test the hypothesis that microglia take up LNPs and repackage them in extracellular vesicles that are subsequently delivered to DMG cells ‘in relay’. In the independent phase (Aim 3), I will explore LNP-mRNA-based gene therapy approach to target oncohistone H3K27M in DMG. Altogether this proposal aims to advance our understanding of DMG and establish a reliable and effective nucleic acid delivery approach for DMG. Completing the proposed project will allow me to build a strong scientific foundation under the mentorship of Profs. Kathryn A. Whitehead (lipid nanoparticle expert), Ian F. Pollack (pediatric brain tumor expert) and Drew Weissman (mRNA expert). An interdisciplinary advisory team has carefully been assembled, consisting of Prof. Robert S. Langer for translational drug delivery expertise, Profs. Maria G. Castro, Carl Koschmann and Sameer Agnihotri for DMG biology and mouse model expertise, Prof. Xiaoming Hu for microglia expertise and Prof. Samira Kiani for gene therapy expertise. Together, this research proposal, mentorship team, advisory committee and institutional support from Carnegie Mellon University will lay the scientific groundwork and provide the necessary training to reach my ultimate goal of successfully starting my independent academic career."
10947150,"Project Summary/Abstract
Despite advances in medical therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), mortality rates are still
unacceptably high. This may be partly due to the lack of therapy that specifically addresses right ventricular
(RV) dysfunction, the primary cause of death in PAH. In the failing RV glucose and fatty acid oxidation are
decreased, leading to deficient ATP production and accumulation of cytotoxic glucose and lipid by-products.
Previous work and preliminary data show that (1) lipid-related insulin resistance is common and RV glucose
uptake is increased in PAH and associated with worse outcomes; (2) a high plasma palmitate to acetylcarnitine
ratio, suggestive of incomplete fatty acid oxidation, is associated with poor survival; and (3) metformin and diet
and exercise can improve RV function. Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of
anti-diabetic drugs that reduce the development and progression of left heart failure with an excellent safety
profile. Empagliflozin promotes cardiac glucose and fatty acid oxidation, improves left ventricular ejection
fraction, lowers pulmonary pressures in heart failure, and attenuates experimental PAH. Our central
hypothesis is that treatment with empagliflozin will improve RV function and other key outcomes in
patients with PAH. To test our hypothesis, we propose three specific aims:
1. To determine if empagliflozin improves RV function in PAH. We propose a randomized, triple-
masked, parallel arm phase II clinical trial of empagliflozin versus placebo in PAH patients on stable
approved PAH-targeted medical therapy. The primary endpoint will be change in RV ejection fraction
measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) after 24 weeks of treatment.
2. To determine if empagliflozin affects patient-reported and other clinical outcomes in PAH. This
aim will assess whether empagliflozin improves secondary endpoints including tricuspid annular systolic
excursion (TAPSE) measured by echocardiography, 6-minute walk distance, N-terminal pro B-type
natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels, the composite endpoints of time to clinical worsening,
multicomponent improvement and French risk score, and general- and disease-specific quality of life.
3. To determine if empagliflozin affects metabolic and other cardiac imaging parameters and to
identify responders to empagliflozin therapy. This aim will assess effects of empagliflozin on
exploratory endpoints related to metabolism and cardiac function including left and right heart interactions.
We will assess the effects of empagliflozin on plasma HDL-C, a strong predictor of outcomes in PAH. We
will determine the effects of empagliflozin on left and right ventricular mass, RV volumes and stroke
volume, interventricular dyssynchrony and RV-arterial coupling. In addition, we will investigate clinical,
biomarker, and cardiac imaging phenotypes associated with response to empagliflozin therapy, defined as
an improvement in RV ejection fraction ≥ 11 percentage points."

 Cancer continues to be a leading cause of death worldwide. Despite significant efforts devoted towards
developing effective treatments, the survival rates remain low in many types of tumors. The long-term goal of
both the F99 and K00 phases of this work will be to reveal new strategies that lead to novel anti-cancer therapies.
The F99 phase will be focused on a cell-intrinsic aspect of cancer biology, while the K00 phase will focus on an
immune cell with great potential to directly inhibit tumor growth and to modulate the efficacy of already approved
cancer immunotherapies.
 The F99 phase: An increasing body of evidence has shown that many cancer cells develop an addiction
to the nuclear transport machinery and have increased numbers of Nuclear Pore Complexes (NPCs), the multi-
protein structures that regulate the nucleocytoplasmic transport of molecules. Recent work has revealed that
inhibition of the assembly of NPCs could represent an effective target for cancer therapeutics. However, the
molecular factors that regulate NPC assembly are incompletely understood and a targetable pathway has yet to
be identified. A whole genome siRNA screen was performed to find genes that regulate assembly of these
structures. Genes were identified that, when knocked down, either increase or decrease the NPC content on the
surface of the nucleus. Knockdown of 3 members of the CCR4-NOT complex were found to increase NPCs. The
CCR4-NOT is a major deadenylase complex that controls protein levels via regulation of mRNA metabolism in
eukaryotes. The work proposed here will characterize the effect of CNOT knockdown on the NPC
number/functionality and how these changes alter basic cellular physiology. Additionally, this work will elucidate
the molecular mechanism by which the CCR4-NOT complex regulates NPCs.
 The K00 phase: In recent years immuno-oncology therapies, namely immune checkpoint blockers, have
shown remarkable clinical efficacy however only a small proportion of patients respond to treatments. One of the
reasons underlying the lack of efficacy stems from the presence of a strong immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment (TME). Until the TME can be modified into a more immuno-activating environment, immune
checkpoint blockade therapies will have limited success. The K00 phase of this project will focus on a unique
and dynamic leukocyte that strongly contributes to the observed immunosuppression; the Tumor-Associated
Macrophage (TAM). TAMs have been shown to compose up to 50% of a tumor’s mass and have both pro- and
anti-tumorigenic phenotypes. The need remains to develop more effective strategies to target this cell type and
reprogram it. The K00 research will characterize the transcriptional networks that can be harnessed to modulate
macrophage repolarization in the TME.
 Successful completion of the F99 phase will reveal a targetable cell-intrinsic aspect of cancer
biology, while completion of the K00 phase will reveal an immuno-oncology targetable pathway."

The landmark White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health in September 2022 underscored the
urgency of improving food and nutrition security in the US as a fundamental strategy to promoting health
equity. Food insecurity – the lack of consistent access to sufficient quantities of healthy food -
disproportionately impacts communities of color and those with limited resources, deepening existing inequities
with nutrition-sensitive chronic conditions like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. To address the interrelated
challenges of food and nutrition insecurity and chronic disease, healthcare organizations are increasingly
integrating “Food as Medicine” nutrition interventions into healthcare to treat disease. A recent policy change in
California provides a powerful, time-sensitive opportunity for a natural experiment to evaluate the impact of
“Food as Medicine” in participants compared to controls from the same highly diverse patient population. In
2022, the California Advancing and Innovating Medi-Cal (CalAIM) Medicaid section 1115/1915(b) included a
provision for medically supportive food for Medi-Cal (Medicaid in California) beneficiaries. It is extremely
critical to start the data collection as soon as possible to be able to complete follow-up data collection
before the policy expires. Alameda County, California, home to a diverse community of 1.6 million, has
leveraged this policy change to offer Recipe4Health to Medi-Cal beneficiaries. Recipe4Health is a leading
Produce Prescription model in the US that includes: 1) Produce Prescription (Food Farmacy); 2) Group and
individual health coaching (Behavioral Pharmacy); and 3) Technical assistance to providers for clinical
integration of Recipe4Health. We will use a quasi-experimental design to evaluate the impact of Recipe4Health
on key markers of cardiometabolic health among patients with a BMI30 (e.g. glycemic control and cholesterol)
using two strategies. Strategy 1 will take advantage of BMI and laboratory data available in the electronic
health record (EHR),using our experience with retrospective propensity score matching. Strategy 2 will include
a prospective random subsample (240 participants+ 240 propensity-score matched controls), with
assessments at 0, 3, and 6 months. With this subsample, point-of-care testing at patient homes will support
timely collection of key laboratory biomarkers (HbA1c and cholesterol), and telephone surveys will allow for
assessment of food and nutrition security and high-quality dietary intake data (24-hour recall). We are uniquely
positioned to conduct this study as we have already built bi-directional community partnerships, infrastructure
to share EHR data, and the infrastructure to conduct point-of-care testing. Successful completion of these aims
will represent a large, generalizable, and rigorous assessment of Food as Medicine in a highly diverse low-
income patient population (~50% Latinx, 20% non-Hispanic Black, 10% Asian/Pacific Islander), with direct
relevance to patients, the healthcare system, and policy makers."
10949692,"Project Summary
 The sex-steroid hormone 17-estradiol (E2) has a well-established role in mediating neuronal physiology,
altering gene expression, and facilitating memory formation. Despite decades of research on E2’s
neuromodulatory effects, much remains unknown regarding which specific gene targets regulated by E2
contribute to its effects on neuronal function and memory. This is in part due to a lack of experimental feasibility,
as the tools necessary for examining cell-type specific transcriptional regulation by E2, and targeted manipulation
of specific E2-sensitive genes, were not previously available. Here, I propose to overcome these hurdles by using
single-nuclei RNA- and ATAC-sequencing, which will allow for comprehensive and unbiased identification of
gene targets regulated by E2 in both sexes at the single-cell level (Aim 1). This approach is advantageous to the
few existing studies examining transcriptomic regulation of sex-steroid hormones, which use brain homogenates
containing a variety of cell types for sequencing experiments. Although such work has been informative, the
receptors through which E2 orchestrates transcriptional control are expressed in a wide variety of distinct cell
types. As such, higher resolution approaches such 10X snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq at the individual cell level
will be necessary to understand the full myriad of estrogenic regulation of gene expression. Another limitation of
previous studies has been the inability to directly manipulate E2-sensitive gene targets to empirically test the
requirement of such changes in expression on memory formation. This proposal will overcome such limitations
by using cutting-edge CRISPR/dCas9-based epigenetic editing approaches to test the requirement of E2 action
at specific gene loci in mediating its beneficial mnemonic effects (Aim 2). Finally, although circulating levels of
E2 have been the focus of much neuroendocrinology research, E2 biosynthesis also occurs locally in the adult
brain of both sexes, via a process regulated by the enzyme aromatase (Cyp19a1). Aim 3 will use a
CRISPR/dCas9 approach to bidirectionally regulate aromatase expression specifically in neurons, to test the
role of neuron-specific E2 synthesis in memory formation. Collectively, these experiments will provide much
needed insight into how E2 acts as a key modulator of neuronal function and memory in both sexes."

It is now possible to generate nonhuman primates (NHPs) with precise germline genomic alterations, enabling
researchers to generate highly refined models of human disease. Significant investments by our team at the
Oregon National Primate Research Center (ONPRC) have greatly advanced NHP transgenic technology,
resulting in the births of five healthy, genetically altered rhesus macaques (RM) since 2019. While these
advancements are extremely promising, existing methods to create transgenic NHPs are too slow and
expensive for most research applications. Innovative technologies are needed to accelerate creation of
transgenic NHPs.
Here we propose to adapt site-directed recombination, a proven technology used in rodent transgenics, to
fundamentally advance NHP transgenic generation. We will generate founder animals with a small “docking
site” integrated into the AAVS1 safe-harbor locus, which is a well-characterized genomic site that provides
consistent expression across tissues. Gametes collected and banked from these animals will provide an “off-
the shelf"" system for subsequent gene editing and transgenic model creation. Embryos or cells from animals
encoding this acceptor site can be injected/transfected with a donor vector that contains the desired genetic
cargo. Site-directed recombination mediates integration of the cargo into AAVS1, with high on-target efficiency
and few limitations in cargo size. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the non-human primate
transgenic field."

The Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) is essential to advancing the science 
and practice of pediatric critical care medicine. The overall aim of this site proposal is for Children’s Hospital of 
Michigan (CHM), under the leadership of Kathleen Meert, MD, to continue as a clinical site in the new and 
expanded CPCCRN. Dr. Meert, site-PI for the CPCCRN for the past 15 years, is a pediatric intensivist with a 
wealth of clinical and translational research experience. Dr. Meert has successfully mentored many junior 
investigators at CHM and other CPCCRN sites, and produced numerous scientific publications for the 
CPCCRN. CHM is a free-standing, tertiary care, academic children’s hospital located in Detroit, Michigan, that 
serves children and families with diverse racial, ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Strengths of CHM as 
a clinical site include the new (2017) Pediatric (PICU) and Cardiac (CICU) intensive care units with a total of 48 
beds and over 2,000 admissions annually. CHM offers the full spectrum of pediatric and surgical subspecialty 
services, and is an American College of Surgeons Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center and an American Burn 
Association Pediatric Burn Center. In addition to the resources available at CHM, Spectrum Health DeVos 
Children’s Hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan, will serve as an Ancillary Site under the leadership of Surender 
Rajasekaran, MD, MPH. DeVos has a total of 32 ICU beds that include a 24-bed PICU and 8-bed CICU; these 
units admit approximately 1,500 children annually. Together, CHM and DeVos will provide access to 80 ICU 
beds and over 3,500 annual admissions, enabling full participation in large randomized controlled trials (RCT). 
The “Personalized Immunomodulation in Sepsis-Induced Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS)” trial 
proposed in this application is a large RCT of personalized, targeted management of immune function in 
children with sepsis-induced MODS. The trial addresses the hypothesis that immunosuppressed children will 
benefit from granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and children with hyperinflammation 
will benefit from targeted anti-inflammatory therapy with anakinra (recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist) or 
tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor blocking antibody). Benefit will be evaluated in terms of duration and severity of 
organ dysfunction, and health-related quality of life and family functioning at 3 and 12 months. Dr. Meert and 
her research team are thoroughly familiar with the CPCCRN studies on which this trial is based including 
methods of sample collection and processing for immunophenotyping, dosing and administration of GM-CSF, 
and collection of short- and long-term sepsis-related outcomes. Dr. Rajasekaran has research expertise in the 
pathogenetic mechanisms underlying pediatric MODS making him well-suited to conduct this trial. Dr. Meert 
and Dr. Rajasekaran have the full support of their respective institutions to participate in the CPCCRN, and are 
strongly committed to collaboration with other CPCCRN sites and the Data Coordinating Center in conducting 
the proposed research, as well as the inclusion and mentoring of junior investigators in CPCCRN activities."

With our participation in this iteration of the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN), 
we contributed to a series of discoveries that enhanced our understanding of disease processes and resulted in 
a multitude of potentially effective treatments for critically ill and injured children that require definitive evaluation 
in clinical trials. There continues to be tremendous need for a collaborative research network in pediatric critical 
care to facilitate the swift and effective translation of scientific and technologic discoveries into clinical advances. 
Access to appropriate patients and expertise in the execution of clinical trials must be linked to scientists and 
laboratories working within and across disciplines at the cutting edge of scientific advancement. At the University 
of Colorado Denver (UCD) and Children’s Hospital Colorado (CHCO), we have a long history of successful 
collaborative basic, translational, and clinical science programs focused on pediatric critical illness and injury. 
We will provide several unique areas of strength to the CPCCRN, including: 1) a distinctive multidisciplinary team 
of collaborative researchers with specific expertise in mechanistic investigations of cardiovascular and 
pulmonary diseases, 2) a proven and successful track record as a clinical site in CPCCRN, 3) expertise with 
pediatric clinical trials execution, including innovative programs to enhance positive research culture among 
clinical staff and participation among patients and families, 4) a 7-state catchment area with high volumes of 
critically ill and injured children, 5) an in-house rehabilitation program and extensive outpatient outreach program 
capable of providing follow-up care to nearly all our critically ill patients, and 6) a dynamic partnership with the 
Children’s Hospital Colorado Research Institute and Colorado Clinical Translational Science Institute to provide 
extensive research resources. Our ancillary site, Arkansas Children’s Hospital (ACH) provides 1) experience 
with pediatric clinical trials execution, including previous successful membership in CPCCRN 2) provision of care 
to nearly all of the critically ill children from the State of Arkansas and a 4-state catchment area, 3) representation 
of an Institutional Development Award (IDeA) state (historically received low levels of NIH support) and involving 
their unique populations (rural, Marshallese, and medically underserved communities) in the NIH mission, and 
4) a rich partnership with the ACH Research Institute and University of Arkansas Clinical Translational Science 
Award to provide comprehensive research resources. Utilizing these assets, we will augment the contributions 
of CPCCRN to the care of critically ill children through rigorous clinical trial execution, innovative translational 
and clinical trial proposals, participation in CPCCRN leadership committees, and training the next generation of 
pediatric critical care researchers. The proposed trial of “Personalized Immunomodulation in Sepsis induced 
Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome” is an incredibly innovative approach that moves beyond a “one therapy 
for all” paradigm to an individualized therapeutic approach that will dramatically improve outcomes for children 
with sepsis. We are enthusiastic and committed to participate in this project with the new 24-site CPCCRN."

 African Americans are almost two times more likely than whites (i.e., Caucasians) to experience Alzheimer's
disease or other dementias. For those over the age of 65, the prevalence of cognitive impairment is 8.8% in whites
and 23.9% in African Americans. Even in the age range of 55-64, African Americans are 4 times more likely to
experience cognitive impairment than their age-matched white counterparts. Increased risk of dementia among
African Americans may be attributed to lower levels and quality of education, lower socioeconomic status (SES),
and higher prevalence of vascular diseases, Type II diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, all of which are
recognized as risk factors for dementia. A critical public health question emerges from these statistics that we
intend to address in this proposal: Is there an effective method for reducing or eliminating the race disparities
in cognitive and brain health? Fortunately, physical activity (PA) interventions may be effective at improving
neurocognitive function and reducing risk for dementia. Despite these promising results, prior PA interventions
have had few African Americans making it difficult to stratify results by race to determine whether African
Americans respond to PA in a similar manner and magnitude as whites. In addition, the terms `physical activity'
and `exercise' are often considered unpleasant, painful, and fatiguing, which can negatively influence interest,
enrollment, and long-term adherence. Methods that increase PA without using the term PA (e.g., dancing) could
be effective at improving health outcomes while simultaneously having a wider impact on translation and long-
term adherence. Here we propose an innovative and culturally sensitive method of increasing PA in older (60-
80 yrs) African Americans. We propose a randomized intervention where 180 older African Americans are
assigned to either a moderate intensity African Dance group 3 days per week (N=90) or to an African
Education group 3 days per week (N=90) for 6-months. Both before and at the completion of the intervention,
we will collect a comprehensive neuropsychological battery and MRI metrics of brain health and function to
identify biological pathways by which PA influences neurocognitive health in an African American population.
This proposal has the potential to utilize community-based activities to improve health of older African
Americans. In addition, it could establish a platform (i.e., dance) to implement future interventions targeting
minority populations to reduce health disparities. We have three primary aims: Aim 1. Examine whether a 6-
month African Dance intervention improves cognitive performance compared to an educational control group.
Aim 2. Examine whether African Dance influences brain morphology, task-evoked neural responses, cerebral
blood flow, and resting state connectivity. Aim 3. Explore potential physiological and socioemotional
mechanisms of the dance intervention. We will collect measures of physical and psychosocial health such as waist
circumference, blood pressure, blood glucose and lipid levels, mood, anxiety, depression, and loneliness and
examine whether intervention-related changes to these measures mediate improvements in cognitive
performance."

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) has made unprecedented strides in discovering previously
unrecognized diversity of neuronal cell types and their functions. Using scRNAseq, we showed that the mouse
geniculate ganglion contains 3 molecularly distinct types of gustatory neurons that innervate taste buds, T1,
T2, and T3, each with unique patterns of gene expression. In a concerted effort from two well-established
laboratories, we now propose a multi-PI project to test hypotheses regarding distinct functions for each of the
major types of neurons and their subtypes. Our ultimate goal is to produce an integrated molecular and
functional categorization of gustatory neurons similar to what has been so powerfully effective in the auditory,
visual, and somatosensory systems. We propose using a newly-optimized method for in vivo confocal Ca2+
imaging, neuron-selective fluorescent markers, and chemogenetic silencing to reveal the functions of T1 and
T3 geniculate ganglion neurons. Specifically, using GCaMP-based Ca2+ imaging, we will test the hypothesis
that within the cluster of T1 neurons there are subclasses that respond to distinct taste qualities whereas
neurons within the T3 cluster respond to multiple, convergent tastes. We will further test the hypothesis that
T1 and T3 neuronal subtypes contribute to separate central pathways serving a number of taste-dependent
functions downstream of initial detection in the taste periphery.
Completing the above aims will move the field of taste into a new era of molecular-functional integration. Our
findings will assist electrophysiology and circuit tracing studies in taste, will shed light on the controversy over
labeled lines versus combinatorial taste coding, and will bring new information on gustatory neural pathways
that are so important to nutrition and ingestive behavior."
10952237,"Project Abstract for Supplement:
This project will adapt the BEhavioral Community-based COmbined Intervention for MEntal Health and
Noncommunicable Diseases (BECOME) intervention to fit the unique needs of people with dementia or mild
cognitive impairment and their caregivers to manage non-communicable diseases (NCDs), like diabetes and
hypertension, and common mental disorders (CMDs), like depression and anxiety. The comorbidities among
people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment with NCDs and CMDs negatively impact cognitive
functioning, exacerbate neuropsychiatric symptoms, increase caregiver burden, and reduce overall quality of
life. Although there is no definitive cure for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias, managing co-
occurring CMDs and NCDs can decelerate disease progression and alleviate caregiver stress. Medications
side effects and concerns about polypharmacy to manage NCDs and CMDs make behavioral interventions
attractive, especially for people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment. There is considerable evidence
that supports the effectiveness of skills-based behavioral interventions in improving mental health benefiting
both patients and caregivers. Despite the significance of these interventions, challenges persist. Interventions
need to be adapted to accommodate the cognitive capacity of people with dementia or mild cognitive
impairment, and incorporation of caregiver’s preferences, capacities, and needs.
The parent project, BECOME, integrates three evidence-based behavioral skills, behavioral activation,
evidence-based stress reduction and motivational interviewing targeting depression, anxiety and behavioral
changes respectively. The interventions are delivered by community health workers (CHWs), who play a
pivotal role in extending access to care for in low-and-middle-income-countries. This supplement aims to adapt
BECOME into a dyadic intervention for both people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment and their
caregivers, tailored to their unique needs. The adaptation will be guided by feedback from an advisory board
consisting of people with dementia or mild cognitive disorder, caregivers, experts on dementia care, NCDs,
and CMDs, and community leader working to bring awareness about dementia, Alzheimer’s disease and mild
cognitive disorders in Nepal and advocate for needed services for the community. Using the ADAPT-ITT
framework, we will adapt the intervention content and delivery into a dyadic approach to match the cognitive
capacities of people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment and integrate caregiver preferences, capacities
and needs. We will pilot the intervention with 5 dyads of people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment and
their caregivers. Finally, using mixed methods, we will evaluate improvements in symptoms of NCDs and
CMDs, and assess facilitator and barriers based on feedback from the dyads and the CHWs with goals to
further refine the intervention to be tested under a future R21 or R34."
10952242,"Project Summary/Abstract
Active listening is central to auditory cognition, supporting critical functions such as stream segregation,
linguistic analysis and perceptual learning. To this end, the brain must accurately represent the physical
properties of acoustic signals and subsequently parse sounds based on their behavioral relevance. Whereas
the encoding of primary features such as amplitude and spectral content typically begins in specialized
brainstem and midbrain circuits, the mechanisms by which sounds attain behavioral relevance are poorly
understood. A long-standing assumption is that descending projections from auditory cortex, which contact
most early ascending auditory circuits, play a critical role in ascribing behavioral relevance to sounds. Indeed,
descending auditory cortical projections could provide an anatomical substrate for ""top-down"" signals to control
the ""bottom-up"" encoding of acoustic features. Despite this presumed importance, little is known about the
function of descending auditory cortical neurons in attentive listening, nor do we understand the biophysical
mechanisms that dictate their contribution to central auditory processing. Our goal is to address these
knowledge gaps in behaving mice by studying the descending pathway from auditory cortex to inferior
colliculus, an auditory midbrain region critical for perceiving complex sounds. Our unpublished results support
a working hypothesis whereby auditory cortico-collicular neurons encode learned information, thereby
transmitting signals that amplify the representation of behaviorally relevant sound features in early auditory
circuits. Our data further suggest that a key mechanism underlying the activity of auditory cortico-collicular
neurons during active listening is the non-linear generation of dendritic spikes, powerful electrical events that
initiate in the apical dendrites of cortical neurons and drive high-frequency burst firing at the soma. We propose
testing these hypotheses using a unique combination of sub-cellular 2-photon Ca2+ imaging, optogenetics and
behavioral assays in awake, head-fixed mice. The positive outcome will be to establish functional and
mechanistic answers for the operation of a descending auditory cortical pathway during attentive listening,
thereby shedding light on a critical yet poorly understood facet of the central auditory system."

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtype with a highly
variable clinical course. While asymptomatic and low-tumor burden patients can initially be managed by
observation, symptomatic patients and patients with high-tumor burden disease are typically managed at
diagnosis with immunochemotherapy (IC). We have shown that IC-treated FL patients who achieve event-
free (i.e., no disease progression or re-treatment) status at 24 months after diagnosis (EFS24) have a
subsequent life expectancy of the background age and sex-matched general population (thus doing well on
standard of care), while those who fail to achieve EFS24 have aggressive disease with poor outcomes and
represent a patient population with an unmet need. However, there is limited ability to identify this patient
population at diagnosis. Building off our prior genome-wide biomarker discovery efforts, we have developed
and internally validated a digital gene expression signature in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
(FFPET) biopsies that predicts early clinical failure (defined as failing to achieve EFS24) in IC-treated FL
using the NanoString nCounter platform, which we call FL24Cx (for FL EFS24 status classifier). We propose
to use the UH2/UH3 mechanism to refine and validate our gene expression assay for use in routinely
collected FFPET using a proven, clinical grade technology with which we have extensive experience. The
goals of the UH2/UH3 proposal are to 1) analytically validate FL24Cx (UH2 Phase) and 2) clinically
validate FL24Cx (UH3 Phase). In the UH2 Phase, we will challenge our preliminary tissue-based assay and
algorithm, evaluate its analytical performance, and adjust as needed to optimize its prognostic power. Using
our extensive test development experience, we will migrate the resulting locked assay to a clinical grade
platform with rapid turnaround time. We will follow the federal guidelines for laboratory developed tests in a
CAP-CLIA certified laboratory, so that the resulting test will be suitable for use in clinical trials and the clinic.
In the UH3 Phase, we will rigorously validate FL24Cx in IC-treated FL patients. This will be conducted in both
the geographically and racially/ethnically diverse Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) observational
cohort study (NCT02736357) and in the large Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) phase III clinical trial
S0016 (NCT00006721). We will also evaluate FL24Cx in two additional NCTN clinical trials in FL.
Furthermore, we will evaluate FL24Cx performance in subgroups defined on initial treatment approach, age,
race/ethnicity, and other clinical factors as well as incorporate use of FL24Cx in the context of clinical models,
further enhancing clinical utility. This application is highly responsive to PAR-20-313 (Assay Validation for
High Quality Markers for NCI-supported Clinical Trials) and at the completion of this study, we will have
rigorously validated FL24Cx to identify patients at high risk of early clinical failure, which is a missing clinical
tool to rapidly conduct informative trials and effectively manage FL patients in the clinic."
10949001,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Breast cancer (BC) remains the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women in the United
States and late-stage metastatic BC remains incurable. The recent approval of immune checkpoint
inhibitors targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 in metastatic triple-negative BC (TNBC) demonstrates that
immunotherapies may be an effective approach to decrease BC mortalities. However, over half of
metastatic BC patients develop metastasis to the liver, a site that responds poorly to immunotherapies.
Despite high prevalence and mortality rates, few research programs focus on BC liver metastasis and little
is known about the impact of metastatic BC cells on the liver microenvironment. My K99/R00 proposal will
fill this gap in knowledge by equipping me with the training to become an independent tenure-track faculty
at a research-intensive institution with a program on BC metastasis, especially liver metastasis, research.
 My postdoctoral work supported by an NCI-T32 and NCI-F32 explored factors secreted by TNBC to
support lung metastasis via immune suppression. My first-author paper showed that aggressive TNBC
secrete cytokines to enhance the number of pro-tumor macrophages. Currently, I am testing the impact of
TNBC heme metabolism by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) on immune suppression via its metabolite bilirubin
(BR). I demonstrated for the first time that TNBC cells secrete BR to alter macrophage polarization and
function. However, HO-1 and BR have never been studied in BC liver metastasis, even though my
preliminary data and work from others showed that HO-1 and BR were elevated in BC patients with liver
metastasis compared to those with metastasis to other sites. The overall goals of this proposal are to: 1)
test the impact of tumor cell-HO-1 on immune cells in the metastatic liver via its regulation of suppressive
cytokines and BR; 2) assess the effects of combined HO-1 and PD-1 inhibition on liver metastatic
outgrowth; and 3) test the impact of BC liver metastasis metabolic reprogramming on HO-1 expression.
 During the mentored K99 phase, I will work with experts in animal procedures, liver disease, tumor
immunology and metabolomics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (CU AMC). Under
their guidance, I will test the effects of BC liver metastasis-HO-1 on checkpoint inhibitor resistance via
promotion of T cell-mediated immune suppression (Aim 1). Throughout the K99 and R00 phases, I will
also assess the impact of tumor cell-BR on liver cells including resident macrophages known as Kupffer
cells (Aim 2). In the R00 phase, I will test the impact of BC liver metastasis-specific metabolic
reprogramming via HIF-1α on HO-1 and determine if this further supports local immune suppression (Aim

10928239,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over 250,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually in the US alone, and about 80% of these 
will be estrogen receptor-α positive (ER+). Despite great progress in treating this ER+ disease by endocrine 
therapy, resistance to this treatment remains a major problem, causing the majority of deaths from breast cancer. 
Our clinical studies on resistance have found that inactivation of the NF1 (for neurofibromatosis type 1) gene, 
which may occur in as much as 20% of primary ER+ breast cancer patients, correlates with a poor outcome in 
tamoxifen-treated patients. NF1 encodes neurofibromin, best known as a Ras repressor (a GTPase Activating 
Protein, or GAP), but the scientific premise of this project stems from our discovery that besides activating Ras, 
loss of NF1 also globally enhances estradiol (E2)-dependent gene expression, thus permitting the cells to grow 
in lower levels of E2 or even in tamoxifen, because NF1 also directly interacts with ER as a transcriptional corepressor. In contrast to their lack of response to E2-deprivation or tamoxifen treatment, NF1-depleted cells still 
respond to fulvestrant, a SERD (Selective ER Degrader), and although the reduced repression of Ras-Raf 
signaling in NF1-depleted cells still allows promotion of cell survival/growth, this in turn could be blocked 
pharmacologically by FDA-approved kinase inhibitors. This project will therefore investigate the hypothesis that 
NF1-deficient ER+ breast tumors should be treated by a SERD together with inhibitors blocking the Ras-Raf 
pathway. To assess whether NF1-status in patient tumors can differentiate treatment responses to various 
endocrine agents, Aim 1 will first establish an effective diagnosis for NF1-deficiency and then analyze how NF1-
status impacts long-term treatment responses in two large randomized neoadjuvant clinical trials, ALTERNATE 
and P024. The former compares fulvestrant vs. AI (anastrozole), while the latter compares tamoxifen vs. another 
AI (letrozole). In addition, we propose that NF1-deficient ER+ breast cancer should be treated by a SERD 
combined with kinase inhibitors targeting the Ras-Raf pathway, so that Aim 2 will conduct preclinical modeling 
to examine new generation oral SERDs and Ras effector kinase inhibitors to find the best combination to drive 
clinical trial design and encourage pharma interest in trial support. A Phase-2 clinical trial to further this treatment 
concept has been planned, for which we already have pharma interest and commitment. We will support this 
trial here by developing technologies to assess how NF1-heterogeneity impacts treatment response. Finally, 
Aim 3 will analyze kinome reprograming after SERD treatment in primary NF1-deficient patients (Aim 1) and in 
preclinical models (Aim 2) by a mass spectrometry-based micro-scaled platform called KiP (Kinome Profiling). 
While our primary objective is to assess whether the use of a SERD in NF1-depleted tumors can lead to 
compensatory Ras-Raf activation, the KiP platform is intrinsically unbiased and may also discover additional 
kinases driving SERD resistance. The successful execution of this project may stop the progression of the NF1-
deficient subset of ER+ aggressive breast cancer early in its tracks."

RFA MH-23-265 identifies a crucial need for validated outcome-focused quality measures to incentivize quality
improvement, inform consumers’ choices regarding care providers, and motivate systematic assessment of
outcomes in community practice. Quality measures based in patient-reported depression outcomes are now
included in National Committee for Quality Assurance Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set
(HEDIS) “report cards” for healthcare systems and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Merit-based
Incentive Payment System (MIPS) program to adjust fee-for-service Medicare payments. Similar measures
are proposed to assess and reward the quality of anxiety treatment.
While outcome-based quality measures should reward more effective care, implementation must guard against
perpetuating or exacerbating inequities. Incentives intended to be race-neutral, or even those aiming to reduce
disparities, can have inequitable consequences, penalizing those serving more Black and Hispanic patients.
Four specific aspects of existing depression measures may exacerbate inequities:
• Broad denominator definitions, including patients with widely varying treatment history and prognosis
• Preference for measures of remission rather than proportional improvement or response
• Focus on relatively narrow outcome windows as late as 12 months after initiating treatment
• Considering all observations without recorded outcome scores to be treatment failures
Data regarding current depression measures both demonstrate substantial racial and ethnic disparities and
raise concerns regarding specific design decisions that may reinforce or exacerbate inequities. While these
biases could be addressed by detailed standardization or adjustment, benefits of more complex measures
must be weighed against the value of simplicity and transparency to measurement users. We propose to use
data from 5 large health systems, including over 350,000 episodes of care for depression to evaluate biases in
existing and proposed outcome-based quality measures. Specific aims include:
Aim 1 – Identify patient characteristics that lead to lower HEDIS/MIPS quality scores for those serving more
 Black and Hispanic patients by measuring to the populations they serve rather than the care they provide.
Aim 2 – Adjust quality measures to account for differences in patient populations identified in Aim 1 and
 compare ranking from adjusted measures to existing HEDIS/MIPS measures.
Aim 3 – Evaluate how altering specific aspects of existing depression measures can reduce bias in
 comparisons of care effectiveness without introducing unnecessary complexity.
Aim 4 – Extend analyses for Aims 1-3 to proposed outcome-focused quality measures for anxiety.
Aim 5 – In collaboration with a range of interested parties, develop proposals for improved outcome-focused
 quality measures for depression and anxiety."
10949002,"Project Summary
 Malignant melanoma is a very aggressive form of cancer in humans. Due to its capacity for metastasis
and resistance to standard therapeutics, it is extremely difficult to cure. Thus, the median survival of patients with
metastatic melanoma is only 8.5 months. Gain of cellular invasive capability occurs in primary melanomas, is
prerequisite for metastasis, and is thought to be a critical step in melanoma progression. The Rho GTPase Rac1
is a critical oncoprotein in melanoma which drives tumor progression, cell invasion, and metastasis. A gain-of-
function mutation of Rac1 (P29S) is reported to be the third most frequent mutation in sun-exposed melanoma,
and is associated with increased disease aggressiveness and resistance to standard-of-care therapeutics.
 Our laboratory previously uncovered a fundamental connection between GTP metabolism enzymes
(GMEs) and Rac1 activity, wherein a noncytotoxic ~25% reduction in cellular GTP levels strongly suppressed
Rac1 and invasion in melanoma. Recently, we elucidated the underlying mechanism by demonstrating a
dependence of Rac1 activity on local GTP production by key rate-limiting GME inosine monophosphate
dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2). IMPDH2 directly interacts with Rac1, and disrupting this interaction suppresses
Rac1 activity and cell invasion. Moreover, our preliminary data demonstrates that IMPDH inhibition significantly
affects melanoma xenograft growth in mice.
 Importantly, Rac1P29S achieves gain-of-function (higher GTP versus GDP occupancy) relative to Rac1WT
through faster displacement of GDP and thus faster GDP/GTP nucleotide exchange. Accordingly, our published
data suggest that Rac1P29S is more sensitive to IMPDH inhibition than Rac1WT. Intriguingly, our preliminary data
uncovered a potential feed-forward mechanism whereby the activity of Rac1P29S (which is regulated by IMPDH2)
also promotes IMPDH2 expression. Therefore, in Specific Aim 1, we will evaluate the efficacy of pharmacological
suppression of IMPDH and targeting this feedback mechanism in preclinical Rac1P29S models. In Specific Aim 2,
we will investigate this feedback loop by defining the mechanism of Rac1P29S-driven IMPDH2 expression, and
characterizing the phenotypic consequences.
 We previously developed genetically-encoded GTP biosensors (GEVALs) which for the first time
visualized free GTP in living cells. By combining this tool with Rac1 activity biosensors, we recently described a
correlation between areas of the cell with high GTP and high Rac1 activity. Therefore, in Specific Aim 3, we will
characterize a newly generated Rac1P29S biosensor compatible for multiplexing with GEVALs, and directly
compare how dependence of Rac1WT versus Rac1P29S activities on local GTP in real time."
10949003,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and a leading cause of death worldwide. The degree
of CRC invasion into the large intestinal wall is associated with patient prognosis. White light endoscopy (WLE)
is used to evaluate lesions of interest within the colon, however WLE provides only morphological information,
often failing to efficiently evaluate the required resection margin or extent of tumor invasion. There is a significant
need to develop an endoscopic approach that can address these challenges. We believe this could be achieved
using spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS) in combination with surface enhanced resonance Raman
scattering (SERRS) contrast agents (CAs). The combination of the two approaches is referred to as surface
enhanced spatially offset resonance Raman spectroscopy (SESORRS). In the proposed preclinical study, I will
test the hypothesis that SESORRS endoscopy could improve existing practices for the detection, staging and
surgical resection of CRC. During the K99 mentored phase, I will build and validate the efficiency of a SORS
endoscope using ex vivo phantoms (SA1.1, SA1.2). Using Apcfl/+ and Apcfl/+;KrasG12D/+ mouse models of CRC,
we will evaluate the efficiency of SESORRS endoscopy to detect and stage CRC in vivo. Results will be
correlated with MRI, PET, and ex vivo histology (SA2.1). The biodistribution and pharmacokinetic profiles of
radiolabeled SERRS CAs will be evaluated using PET imaging (SA2.2). As an independent investigator, I will
determine the optimal dose of SERRS CAs required for SORS endoscopic imaging of CRC (SA2.3). In SA3 I
will determine and validate the advantage of using molecularly targeted-SERRS CAs over non-targeted SERRS
CAs, together with the ability of SESORRS endoscopy to assist in the surgical resection of lesions of interest by
detecting residual tumor cells on the surface, and beneath, the resection bed. If successful, SESORRS
endoscopy could be very useful in the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of CRC. This project will enable us
to predict the potential success of clinical SESORRS endoscopy and increase the likelihood of achieving
eventual clinical translation. I have a unique set of expertise in SERRS, SORS and SESORRS imaging and
believe I am highly qualified to lead, and conduct, the proposed project here at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
I also have identified the following key areas which require additional training in order to support my transition to
independence: (1) mouse models of CRC; (2) understanding the cancer biology of CRC and the influence of
genetic mutations on CRC invasion; (3) radiochemistry and PET imaging and; (4) requirements for clinical
translation. I have deliberately chosen and carefully assembled a world-class committee of mentors and advisors
including my primary mentor Dr. Kevin Haigis, as well as Dr. Conor L. Evans and Dr. Norman Nishioka who will
serve as co-mentors. My mentors are in full support of my research and career goals. I am committed to this
award and strongly believe that it will help me gain the necessary training required to enable my long-term career
goal of being an established investigator in the field of molecular imaging."
10949720,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Depressive disorders are increasingly prevalent in modern societies. Clinical depression is the leading cause of
disability worldwide and an underlying condition for two-thirds of suicidal attempts in the United States. Precision
neuromodulation and particularly transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) promise a unique technological
approach to the therapy of depression. TMS creates a well-controlled magnetic field that induces a focal electric
field in the brain and can elicit action potentials in neurons. Rhythmic TMS is already FDA-approved for major
depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and nicotine addiction. Novel TMS protocols such as
intermittent theta-burst stimulation (TBS) can rapidly induce lasting potentiation of neural circuits. In 2019, TBS
was FDA-approved for depression after it was demonstrated that a three-minute TBS session was as effective
as 40 minutes of conventional rhythmic TMS. Despite their initial success, a major challenge for TMS and TBS
remains a persistent inter- and intra-individual variability of outcomes. This is likely due to currently limited
spatiotemporal precision and lack of personalization.
Here, I propose to develop and validate spatiotemporally precise personalized TBS tailored for the therapy of
depression. For that, I will create a closed-loop TBS-EEG system that integrates spatial precision by leveraging
individual structural magnetic resonance imaging for neuronavigation and temporal precision due to real-time
electroencephalography (EEG). Using neuronavigation, I will compensate for known inter-individual variability in
the prefrontal anatomy and focus the individual center of DLPFC previously found to be an optimal TMS target
in depression. Ongoing EEG will inform the system about the excitatory/inhibitory states of the prefrontal cortex,
as reflected in the brain oscillations, to trigger stimulation pulses at the most excitable time. Further, I will improve
the functional precision by tagging the individual prefrontal brain oscillations implicated in depressive behavior
using EEG during a validated cognitive test. In particular, theta and gamma oscillations are known biomarkers
of prefrontal activity and depressive disorders. From the individual theta and gamma frequencies, I will derive
the personalized parameters of TBS. Finally, I will conduct a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in healthy
humans and a feasibility study in a clinical population to assess the long-lasting effects of the personalized TBS-
EEG on prefrontal electrophysiology and depressive behavior.
All these combined efforts will enhance our fundamental understanding of the prefrontal circuitry mechanisms
underlying depression and enable novel personalized therapy of depression within the precision-medicine
framework."
10951747,"Diffuse Midline Glioma (DMG) is an inoperable pediatric brain tumor with no good treatment options.
Our group has developed a novel treatment modality for this disease and others, using mRNA vaccines
consisting of tumor derived antigens packed into a unique lipid nanoparticle (NP). They can provide near
immediate immune induction against inciting malignancies. RNA-NPs can thus be harnessed as an
effective therapy for patients with DIPG and other refractory malignancies. In addition, DIPG has a
highly conserved H3K27M mutation that serves as an excellent target for these therapies.
Based on the above, we propose exploring the immunogenicity of RNA-NPs targeting the DIPG
H3K27M mutation, as well as the feasibility, safety, and anti-tumor activity of tumor loaded RNA-NP
vaccines in animal models. These RNA NPs have shown survival benefit in our preclinical murine model
of DMG. Among these animals with significant survival benefit, there is development of hydrocephalus,
which is thought to be secondary to increased lesion size secondary to an immunotherapeutic response
during treatment. In our clinical trials investigating RNA NPs as a treatment for canine glioma in adult
dogs, we saw a similar effect in MRI imaging of animals that became long-term survivors. Following
detailed analysis of these lesions in mouse, canine and human patients during RNA-NP therapy, there
appears to be features of both reactive gliosis and traditional pseudoprogression (immune infiltration),
suggesting a new radiographic diagnosis I have named paraprogression. I hypothesize that
paraprogression is a novel radiographic entity characterized by reactive gliosis and increased lesion size
in therapeutic responders. In this study, I aim to visualize paraprogression using advanced MRI
techniques, elucidate the mechanism behind the increase in lesion size, and combat this effect without
compromising our promising survival benefit conferred by RNA NP vaccine in our preclinical DMG
model."

10793009,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Lynch syndrome (LS), the most common inherited cause of colorectal cancer (CRC) affecting ~1.2 million Amer-
icans, carries 3-8x higher lifetime CRC risk than the general population. Colonoscopy starting early in adulthood
and repeated yearly or biennially is the only recommended surveillance strategy which translates into ~25-50
lifetime colonoscopies. This intensive colonoscopy surveillance is not ideal because: a) CRC risk varies widely
by LS gene and age, b) colonoscopies are invasive, costly, and not readily accessible to all patients, and c)
adherence is suboptimal. Personalized surveillance strategies in LS that integrate non-invasive tests with colon-
oscopy would address limitations and barriers in current clinical practice but have not been previously studied.
To address these gaps, this multi-center, prospective trial will examine performance of fecal immunochemical
test (FIT) in LS patients undergoing colonoscopy surveillance. In addition to measuring FIT test characteristics
(specificity, sensitivity, negative and positive predictive value), this study will examine LS patients' attitudes and
acceptability of non-invasive tests (Aim 1). The proposal will evaluate personalized surveillance strategies in LS
that integrate non-invasive tests and colonoscopy using simulation modeling (Aim 2). An important deliverable
is the 1st well-annotated, prospective LS biobank in the US for future studies of promising biomarkers and clinical
outcomes (Aim 3). This study is timely because of the unique opportunity to harmonize data with the UK “FIT for
Lynch” study that began recruitment in 2023 in order to evaluate FIT performance in a large, international LS
cohort. Taken together, the proposal is significant because it has potential to change paradigms of CRC surveil-
lance in order to improve the lives and longevity of LS patients."
10947351,"Project Summary/Abstract
Climate change is a global crisis and an issue of intergenerational injustice, placing disproportionate and unjust
harm on young people and future generations. Consequentially, young people are experiencing significant
climate-related psychological distress. Climate change also exacerbates existing inequalities, resulting in
worse mental health burden on youth who face greater social and environmental vulnerabilities (e.g.,
socioeconomically disadvantaged youth, Black, Indigenous, Youth of color [BIYOC]). Young people are
increasingly engaging with climate change issues through social media. Unfortunately, social media can have
emotional consequences, exposing youth to a higher volume of information about the climate crisis without
strategies for managing distress. Moreover, recent increases in racial discrimination via social media place
BIYOC at greater risk for mental health difficulties when engaging with climate activism in online spaces. The
current study will explore how minority youth experiences with climate activism via social media confer youth
risk and resilience for psychopathology and impact equity-focused climate action to inform prevention efforts
that reduce climate-related mental health consequences and race-based health disparities. In Aim 1, will use
social network analysis and content analysis to elucidate network properties and content of influential climate
activism social media accounts to inform strategies that may enhance the reach and uptake of messages
centering climate-racial justice advocacy and minority mental health promotion. Aim 2 will draw on youth
participatory action methods using ethnographic tools to explore minority youth perceptions of how engaging
with climate activism on social media impacts mental health and behaviors. In Aim 3, we will retain a subset of
youth from Aim 2 and recruit adult environmental health specialists to co-design a minority-focused climate
resilience social media campaign, informed by theory and findings from Aims 1 and 2 on resilience building,
minority-focused climate communication strategies. We will collect pilot data regarding minority youth
perceptions of campaign feasibility and acceptability, as well as youth and adult perceptions of the partnership
process. Successful completion of these aims will contribute to the NIH Climate Change and Health Initiative
Strategic Framework to understand the effects of climate change-induced stress on youth development and
NIMHD Priority Research Areas to reduce the effects of climate change among populations who experience
health disparities looking at multiple domains (i.e., behavioral, sociocultural) and multiple levels (i.e., individual,
interpersonal) of influence."
10949086,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Immunotherapies that block the checkpoint molecules programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand
PD-L1 have revolutionized cancer treatment; however, a significant number of patients display resistance to
immunotherapy, either de novo or with disease relapse after initial response [1-3]. Immunotherapy-refractory
cases have prompted insight into mechanisms of resistance, which should ultimately lead to new strategies to
expand clinical efficacy. Primary resistance is linked to lack of immune cell infiltration within the tumor
microenvironment (TME), an observation which has prompted deeper investigation into the tumor and host
factors that regulate the degree of spontaneous T cell activation and infiltration into tumor sites. One relevant
source of inter-patient heterogeneity is the variable presence of polymorphisms (SNPs) in immune-regulatory
genes, many of which have been linked previously to the propensity towards autoimmunity.
 In the F99 phase of this proposed plan, I will evaluate the utility of targeting an autoimmune-associated
gene to increase immunotherapy efficacy. A SNP in the tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 22
(PTPN22) gene is attributed with the greatest risk for autoimmune disease outside mutations in the human
leukocyte antigen locus [4-6]. PTPN22 negatively regulates the activation of multiple immune compartments,
with loss-of-function variants leading to heightened immune cell activation in mice and humans [7-8]. This
increase in immune activity is attributed to the expansion of activated CD8+ T cells, however, work reported to
date have utilized global knockout mice (KO), confounding the specific role of PTPN22 in other cell lineages
relevant for anti-tumor immunity, in particular myeloid cells. We thus developed a PTPN22fl/fl mouse to study its
effect in different immune cell types via conditional KO mouse models. I hypothesize that loss of PTPN22
augments the ability of DCs to activate antigen specific CD8+ T cells through 1) improved priming in the
tdLN or recruitment to and/or survival signaling in the TME and that 2) deletion of PTPN22 in
macrophages also may potentiate anti-tumor immunity.
 In the K00 phase of the proposed plan, I aim to identify novel targets governing anti-tumor immunity and
immunotherapy efficacy by 1) identifying autoimmune related SNPs whose loss of function variants correlate
with increased tumor immune infiltration and 2) characterizing the effect of these targets on tumor progression
and immunotherapy response through functional studies using conditional KO mice. This work holds the potential
to elucidate novel therapeutic targets to potentiate anti-tumor immunity. My ultimate goal is to become a tenure-
track faculty member at a leading academic research institution and conduct NIH funded work contributing to the
field of tumor immunology by elucidating anti-tumor immunity and developing novel immunotherapies."
10949088,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the adaptive immune response, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) continuously “crawl” seeking evidence of foreign
peptide fragments on the surface of other cells. Once the T cell encounters a target cell with foreign or mutant
peptides, then it is activated unleashing a potent immune response. Emerging evidence suggests that cell
mechanical forces transmitted to the T cell receptor (TCR) contribute to its high specificity in antigen recognition
and promote T-cell activation. This is not surprising, as the TCR and other T cell co-receptors bind their cognate
ligands only when two dynamic cells physically “touch”. As a first step toward understanding the role of molecular
forces in tuning T cell response, it is important that we measure the magnitude of forces transmitted to ligand-
receptor complexes and then to relate mechanical events to signaling and functional responses.
 My PhD research (F99 phase) has focused on developing methods to measure and elucidate the role of
mechanical forces in immune response. I have designed a microparticle tension senor that allows one to quantify
receptor forces in high throughput and also to measure forces at curved cell junctions. Additionally, I used this
assay to screen the dose-response function of drugs that modulate cell mechanics. Because T cell responses
are fine tuned by an array of co-receptors, I tested the role of mechanics in LFA-1 function. In this work, I
demonstrated that the magnitude of LFA-1 integrin forces fine tunes TCR triggered activation and antigen
discrimination. In addition, I revealed mechanically active LFA-1 defines the permissive zones for cytotoxic
secretion, and suppression of LFA-1 forces significantly abrogates cytotoxicity.
 My work suggests that receptors cooperate to tune T-cell responses. For the remainder of my F99 phase,
I will investigate the mechano-communication between receptor forces. Specifically, I will develop a DNA origami
nano device to pattern ligands and measure spatiotemporal colocalization of mechanical events. Afterwards, I
will proceed to test this hypothesis on cell plasma membrane by engineering tension probes on the surface of
living cells. This will enable one to control and measure TCR-forces at authentic cell-cell junctions that mimic the
chemical and physical properties of the immune synapse.
 For my postdoctoral work (K00 phase), I aim to improve upon current cancer therapies by leveraging T
cell mechanics in boosting the specificity of immune response. In adoptive cell therapy (ACT), after therapeutic
T-cell reinfusion, adjuvant drugs such as cytokines need to be administered to boost immune reconstitution.
However, nonspecific drug release causes side effects and T-cell exhaustion. To address this challenge, I will
decorate T-cells with DNA cages that mechanically trigger the release of encapsuled drugs at the tumor zone. If
successful, this work will significantly enhance the ACT efficiency and offer the first example that links
mechanobiology to cancer immunotherapy."

The overarching goal of the Clinical Pharmacology and Analytical Chemistry (CPAC) Core is to facilitate the 
development of safe, effective strategies for HIV prevention, treatment and cure. To achieve this goal, the CPAC 
Core provides pharmacology and bioanalytical expertise to advance research within and beyond the UNC CFAR 
through the following specific aims: (1) provide services to expedite translation of HIV research into therapeutic 
strategies, (2) introduce new services to respond to evolving HIV research needs, (3) interact within and beyond 
the UNC CFAR to enhance HIV research collaborations, (4) support scientific working groups, research interest 
groups, early stage investigators, and investigators new to HIV to develop the next generation of scientific 
leadership, (5) prioritize dissemination/outreach, strategic planning, and evaluation to maximize impact, and (6) 
follow standardized policies and procedures to promote harmonious intra-CFAR interaction. The CPAC Core 
executes these aims by proactively engaging investigators to identify and deliver services essential for HIV 
pharmacology research. The Core contributes to the design, management, analysis, and publication of HIV 
research by assisting with hypothesis framing, study design, and grant/proposal development, by facilitating 
multidisciplinary and translational approaches to clinical study design and conduct, and by selecting or 
generating optimal bioanalytical or pharmacometric methods, with subsequent provision of analyses, in both 
preclinical and clinical settings. New services are developed to respond to the evolving needs of the HIV research 
community working within priority research areas as well as tailored to individual investigator requests. Early 
stage investigators and investigators new to HIV research receive the highest priority for Core services. Strong 
institutional support from the UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy allows the Core to take full advantage of 
existing infrastructure and resources, including contacts with faculty renowned for their expertise in specialized 
fields of pharmacology. The Core Co-Directors, Drs. Angela Kashuba and Mackenzie Cottrell, are responsible 
for Core management and strategic planning, in consultation with the Core’s Internal and External Advisory 
Boards, as well as through surveys of the CFAR membership and discussions at CFAR retreats."

Pediatric Critical Care Medicine incorporates a multidisciplinary approach to address the medical needs of the
most fragile population of critically ill and injured children. While current mortality rates at most academic, tertiary 
care children’s hospitals are below 5%, certain disease processes, notably sepsis and acute respiratory distress 
syndrome which are often accompanied with the presence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), 
remain associated with significantly higher mortality rates and utilize substantial health care resources. Despite 
this, the occurrences of these most challenging diseases do not occur sufficiently often at any one center to 
enable an effective, single-site study that will advance both our understanding and management of these 
diseases. Mindful of this reality, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human 
Development (NICHD) demonstrated great insight and vision in funding an infrastructure to create a multi-center 
research network, the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN). Our Pediatric Critical 
Care program at the University of Michigan, and the division Critical Care Medicine at the Children’s Hospital of 
Wisconsin and the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) who will participate as our ancillary site, have the 
infrastructure to allow us to actively participate in a number of multi-site studies. In addition to possessing this 
infrastructure, we also believe both sites have a team of investigators who can make important scientific and 
leadership contributions to the field. As a result, we are applying to participate within CPCCRN as a Clinical Site 
to assist in executing a large clinical trial investigating the efficacy of GM-CSF in critically ill children with sepsis
entitled, Personalized Immunomodulation in Sepsis-induced MODS. We have the infrastructure and intellectual 
capacity to contribute in a meaningful way to the on-going growth and success of this research network that is 
committed to improving both the short- and long-term outcomes of critically ill and injured children. The goals of 
this proposal are for the Division of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine at the University of Michigan and our partner 
ancillary site, the Division of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin to collaborate
fully with the Executive Committee, the Data Coordinating Center and the other CPCCRN sites. In combination 
with our partner ancillary site, our site will provide access to over 100 PICU beds with over 4500 annual 
admissions, enabling us to participate fully in the “Personalized Immunomodulation in Sepsis-induced MODS” 
trial described in the overall component of this application. Our site proposal has three specific aims to achieve 
these goals: 1) to actively collaborate in implementation of the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research 
Network clinical trial, 2) to provide opportunities for young investigators at the University of Michigan, as well as 
the Medical College of Wisconsin, to participate in CPCCRN meetings, committees, or trial implementation with 
the goal of developing these promising and talented individuals into fundable clinician scientists, 3) to implement 
the Personalized Immunomodulation in Sepsis-induced MODS trial."
10916284,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chromosome segregation is driven by a spindle machinery that distributes copies of the
genome between daughter cells. In eggs and their progenitor oocytes, chromosomes are segregated in a
specialized meiotic division program. Oocytes and eggs are remarkably vulnerable to chromosome
segregation errors that give rise to aneuploidy in embryos, a leading cause of spontaneous miscarriages
and developmental disorders. Embryo aneuploidy can nonetheless arise even after error-free completion
of meiotic chromosome segregation. However, our understanding of the underlying causes of embryo-specific
aneuploidies has been restricted by a tendency to focus only on meiosis-derived aneuploidies.
Until recently, it was believed that microtubules are the only cytoskeletal components
required for chromosome segregation. This view was successfully challenged by our discovery of spindle
F-actin in oocytes and eggs that boost chromosome-spindle attachments and prevent aneuploidy. How is
spindle F-actin assembled and how does it exert its function at the chromosome-microtubule interface?
These are among outstanding questions raised by this paradigm shift in our understanding of cell division.
A major goal of my lab is to understand the mechanisms that safeguard accurate
chromosome segregation in mammalian oocytes and embryos. Driven by our discovery that spindle F-actin
constitutes one such protection mechanism, we are combining advanced microscopy assays with
rapid protein degradation tools to identify proteins required for spindle F-actin assembly and function in
oocytes. This approach has revealed key actin- and microtubule-binding proteins that govern oocyte
chromosome segregation, some of which were independently implicated in sporadic miscarriages and
developmental disorders in recent genetic studies of infertility patients. We propose to build on this
progress and study the origins of embryo-specific aneuploidy by 1) expanding our candidate-based rapid
protein degradation screens to a larger subset of actin-microtubule crosstalk proteins, and 2) developing
a new biochemical and proteomics-coupled experimental pipeline for unbiased identification of novel
spindle F-actin assembly proteins in oocytes and embryos. Furthermore, we will take direct experimental
approaches of adding or removing centrosomes using microinjection and laser microsurgery tools to
address why spindle-shaped F-actin structures are unique to acentrosomal spindles. Early mouse embryo
mitotic divisions, which are executed without canonical centrosomes, will provide us with an attractive
experimental model in which to answer this long-standing question in cell biology.
When this research is completed, we will have discovered and functionally characterized
spindle F-actin assembly proteins in oocytes and embryos. Overall, this study will reveal how distinct
cytoskeletal systems cooperate to drive accurate chromosome segregation in early development."
10953167,"ABSTRACT: Investigating Sex-Specific Mechanisms of a Small Molecule Drug in Huntington's
Disease for Enhanced Women's Health
 Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder with a complex clinical
presentation affecting both males and females. Despite its autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, sex-
specific differences in disease manifestation and progression have been observed, likely influenced by
hormonal, genetic, and other factors. Presently, a cure for HD remains elusive, and the existing treatments
primarily focus on alleviating symptoms and managing disease progression, albeit with limited efficacy.
Therefore, new approaches for the treatment of HD are urgently needed.
 In our pursuit of finding a potential therapeutic candidate for HD, we utilized a novel in-silico fragment
scanning approach targeting the surface of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) polyQ. This led us to identify GLYN122
as a promising candidate. In vitro experiments revealed that GLYN122 directly binds to mHTT, reducing its
levels and inducing autophagy in neurons. Most exciting, n vivo studies usingGLYN122 demonstrated the
ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, reducing mHTT levels in the cortex and striatum of the R6/2 mouse
model of HD and subsequently improving motor symptoms. Intriguingly, female R6/2 mice treated with
GLYN122 exhibited significant improvements in rotarod performance at 10 weeks of age, whereas male
counterparts displayed impaired performance at 8 weeks of age. To advance our understanding of these sex-
specific responses to GLYN122 and their underlying mechanisms, we propose to leverage the infrastructure of
the Molecular Center of Health and Disease (MCHD)-COBRE. Our research will focus on both male and
female HD mouse models, comprehensively assessing behavioral, neuropathological, and molecular aspects.
To achieve our objective, we propose to: (1) Investigate sex differences in the therapeutic effects of GLYN122
on motor deficits and neuropathological features in the R6/2 mouse model of HD; and (2) Explore sex
differences in mechanistic studies of GLYN122's effects on gene expression and transcriptional regulation in
HD. We will assess motor function and neuropathological features using behavioral assessments and
histological analyses, respectively. The cores (B-C) of the MCHD-COBRE will uniquely allow us to conduct
single cell RNAseq and spatial gene expression analyses, examining how GLYN122 affects gene expression
and transcriptional regulation in a cell type specific manner.
 Our research aims to uncover how GLYN122 affects Huntington's disease (HD) in a sex-specific
manner, enhancing its potential as a personalized therapeutic strategy. This aligns with the goals of
Administrative Supplements for Research on Women’s Health in the IDeA States (Notice Number: NOT-GM-
22-005), which emphasize studying the influence of sex and gender on complex therapeutic interventions. By
exploring sex-specific responses to interventions like GLYN122, we seek to improve tailored treatments for
HD, advancing research relevant to women's health."

Decades of research have generated knowledge and tools with the potential to prevent all new HIV infections,
to ultimately end the HIV epidemic in the United States and worldwide, and to improve the lives of people living
with HIV. To date, reality has fallen short of these goals, in part due to pressing unmet needs. The Tennessee
Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) is located in the Southeastern United States, the region with the greatest
number of new HIV infections, and of persons living with HIV. This CFAR was established in 2015, under the
leadership of Prof. Simon Mallal, as a three-way partnership between a research-intensive medical institution
(Vanderbilt University Medical Center, VUMC), a historically black medical college (Meharry Medical College,
MMC), and an academically engaged state health department (Tennessee Department of Health, TDH). This
partnership has fostered collaborations that would be unimaginable without CFAR. For example, results of an
analysis by VUMC and MMC investigators using TDH surveillance data has affected statewide public policy and
law regarding needle exchange, reducing the likelihood of a potentially devastating HIV outbreak in rural
Tennessee. To end the epidemic, it is becoming increasingly important to pursue community-engaged research,
to include both people living with HIV and those at high risk. Toward this end, this CFAR has newly partnered
with a fourth institution, Nashville CARES, a sophisticated community-based organization with a 25-year
exclusive focus on people living with HIV and those at high risk. Through this four-way partnership, our vision is
to have transformative, local and global translational impact. Guided by this vision, our mission is to coordinate
the complementary institutional and community strengths and resources of VUMC, MMC, TDH and CARES to
most effectively reduce the burden of HIV/AIDS and generalize these benefits nationally and globally. Work of
this CFAR aligns with National Institutes of Health high priorities for NIH/AIDS research. To fulfill our mission,
this CFAR will pursue four specific aims: 1) To support multidisciplinary HIV research that leverages the highly
collaborative local environment to build impactful team science among the four institutions of the CFAR; 2) To
nurture and support career development of junior investigators, so as to grow the number and diversity of the
next generation of HIV researchers; 3) To specifically enable HIV research opportunities for MMC investigators,
to include engagement with investigators and resources across the CFAR, and leveraging team science; and 4)
To continue to grow a broad emphasis on HIV-focused community-engaged research that pervades the CFAR,

Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) are blood disorders caused by defective hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that
clonally expand and fail to produce blood cells of sufficient quality and quantity. Germline heterozygous
mutations in DDX41, an essential RNA Helicase, are the most common cause of inherited predisposition to MDS.
These mutations are typically frameshifts and cause loss of full-length protein. Patients with these mutations
have normal health into adulthood but have an elevated risk of developing MDS with a median age of 69 years.
The cellular and molecular mechanisms by which these mutations contribute to MDS pathogenesis remain poorly
defined. The most common co-mutation in these patients is acquired missense mutation of the other DDX41
allele, often causing the amino acid substitution R525H. We developed two conditional mutant Ddx41 alleles to
model the germline loss-of-expression mutation and the acquired R525H mutation in mice. We found that mice
with hematopoietic-specific, heterozygous loss of Ddx41 live normal length lives and have predominantly normal
hematopoiesis with only a modest reduction in red blood cell number. In contrast, the combination of one loss-
of-expression allele and the R525H-mutant allele causes profound cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in proliferative
hematopoietic progenitor cells. This observation calls into question why the R525H mutation arises and how the
mutant clones that acquire it can expand to contribute to disease. In patients, the acquired mutation has a median
variant allele frequency of just 10%, indicating it occurs in a non-dominant clone, consistent with reduced
proliferative capacity. In this project, we plan to develop models of DDX41-mutated MDS that account for the
cellular and temporal context of mutation acquisition, including DDX41-heterozygosity in hematopoietic and non-
hematopoietic cells during natural aging and the acquisition of the R525H mutation in only a subset of HSC at
an advanced age. To do this, we will age large cohorts of constitutive Ddx41+/- mice and Ddx41+/flox;Vav-Cre
(hematopoietic-specific) mice to at least 24 months of age. We will also cross these models with a genetic model
of accelerated aging to drive more rapid disease development. Finally, we will induce expression of the R525H
mutation in a subset of HSC in the context of Ddx41+/- bone marrow to mimic the mixed clonality of MDS patient
bone marrow. We hypothesize that these genetic models, which accurately follow the natural progression of the
disease in vivo, will yield MDS-like disease states that can be further studied to elucidate the cellular and
molecular mechanisms of MDS pathogenesis. The ultimate goal of these studies is to fully understand the cause
of MDS predisposition in patients with DDX41 mutations such that we can rationally design strategies to prevent
or treat the disease."

Tuberculosis continues to kill about 1 million people including children each year with 8 million new cases.
Regrettably, coinfection with HIV-1 has aggravated the problem because HIV-1 depletes CD4 T cells, which are
the main defense mechanism against tuberculosis. For the reason, BCG, which is a live attenuated vaccine
against tuberculosis, cannot be given to people living with HIV. We recently discovered that Sirtuin type of
protein and histone deacetylates play a major role in regulating the growth of both M. tuberculosis and HIV-1 in
human macrophages and drug targeting Sirtuins could control both pathogens in cell culture models and in
humanized mice. Therefore, we propose to investigate Sirtuin-dependent intervention to understand how TB and
HIV-1 infections induce these enzymes and how we can develop novel immunochemotherapy for confections.
Specifically:
Aim-1: We will analyze the impact of early Mtb and HIV infection on Sirtuin gene and protein induction in
macrophages and identify their epigenetic targets. We will examine the hypothesis that Mtb-induced Sirtuin-2
can augment HIV-1 replication, whereas HIV-1 induced Sirtuin-2, in turn enhances Mtb growth in MФs thereby
aggravating coinfections. We will then develop an immunochemotherapy (ICT) using a combination of Sirtuin
drugs, TB and HIV targeting drugs to kill and eradicate both HIV-1 and M. tuberculosis in macrophages. Aim-2:
We will investigate the effect of Sirtuin drugs on early and late stages of TB-HIV-1 coinfection using humanized
mice and determine whether ICT can eradicate confections. Aim-3: Tuberculosis granulomas can restrict growth
of M. tuberculosis pathogen, although prior infection with HIV-1 can deplete CD4 T cells and affect granuloma
formation. We will use a TB-HIV coinfection model of humanized mice to determine if Sirtuin-drug therapy can
activate macrophages of granulomas and increase host-defense against tuberculosis. Our overall goal is to
develop innovative immune defense-based intervention methods to eradicate TB-HIV coinfections."
10946957,"Project Summary/Abstract
Intrusive memories of a traumatic experience are prevalent among individuals exposed to trauma and are leading
predictors of the onset, maintenance, and severity of transdiagnostic post-traumatic mental health difficulties.
Clinical accounts of these intrusive memories highlight their vivid, mostly visual, sensory details that emerge
involuntarily to intrude on conscious thought and elicit a spontaneous reliving of the trauma in the “here and
now”. Despite these sensory-rich features, extant biological models of trauma-related intrusive memories (TR-
IMs) have largely overlooked the sensory cortex in favor of a prefrontal cortex-hippocampus circuit. The present
proposal aims to fill this gap through a multilevel characterization of intrinsic sensory cortical disinhibition and its
impacts on large-scale neural networks and the day-to-day phenomenological experience of TR-IMs. Combining
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), electroencephalography (EEG), and functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) in trauma-exposed adults (N = 75), this project will link lower levels of inhibitory neural activity
(alpha oscillations) and an imbalance in excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmitter systems (glutamate/GABA) to
perturbations in the intrinsic functional organization of resting-state neural network dynamics. Ecological
momentary assessments (EMAs) of TR-IMs in this sample will further link such sensory cortical disinhibition to
the vivid, sensory-perceptual properties of TR-IMs, offering a novel candidate mechanism for therapeutic
interventions in sensory cortical disinhibition. An additional sample of non-trauma exposed adults (N = 25) with
intrusive memories of non-traumatic negative life events will undergo the same neuroimaging and EMA protocol
to further delineate the specificity of this mechanism to trauma exposure. Taken together, this project will offer
the first multilevel characterization of the sensory system in survivors of trauma, spanning molecules, circuits,
and ecological self-reports, and pave the way for future investigations utilizing neuromodulation to
mechanistically test the proposed sensory cortical disinhibition model of trauma intrusions. Drawing on the
expertise from a complementary team of mentors (Drs. Isabelle Rosso, Fei Du, and Diego Pizzagalli) and
collaborators (Drs. Christian Webb, Joshua Brown, Lauren Bylsma, and Fabio Ferrarelli), the applicant will
receive in-depth, hands-on training in 1) neurochemistry methods and analysis, 2) ecological momentary
assessments, 3) multimodal data integration and conceptual model development, and 4) neuromodulation
techniques for mechanistic and therapeutic research. The acquired data and proposed training plan will launch
the applicant into an independent research career at McLean Hospital, integrating multimodal neuroimaging,
ambulatory clinical assessments, and advanced neuromodulation techniques to develop novel, mechanism-
based interventions for transdiagnostic post-traumatic sequelae."

 A causal hallmark of brain aging and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is loss of proteostasis, the maintenance of
proteome health through several processes, including protien degradation/clearance (hereafter, ‘turnover’).
Neuronal proteostasis is exceptionally vulnerable during aging and AD as evidenced by the accumulation of
dysfunctional or toxic neuronal proteins, such as pTau and Aβ, causal for neuron dysfunction and degeneration.
While there is an appreciation for the role of dysregulated proteostasis in brain aging and AD, much remains to
be understood about the dynamics of neuronal protein turnover (NPT), consequences of aberrant NPT,
and NPT regulators during aging and AD. I hypothesize that NPT is compromised with aging and AD,
ultimately worsening age and AD phenotypes, and NPT is at least partially regulated by lysosomal biology and
microglia. I am uniquely positioned to address my hypotheses thanks to my establishment of a new in vivo model
of bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT). BONCAT permits the tagging of newly
synthesized proteins with an azide-bearing phenylalanine (AzF) in a cell-specific manner. Tagged proteins can
be pulled down and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). When AzF is provided to BONCAT mice in a pulse-
chase administration scheme and mice are sacrificed at different time points in the chase, tagged proteins can
be pulled down and their reduction over the chase/time, representative of turnover, can be examined. I have
performed this experiment in young and aged neuronal-BONCAT mice, finding >800 relatively longer-lived
proteins (RLLPs) with aging, many of which are in pathways of neurodegeneration. Here, I propose to perform
an identical experiment in AD models, compare the results to aging, and use an in vitro human transdifferentiated
neuron model in conjunction with targeted protein degradation to determine the pathological consequences of
select RLLPs common to aging and AD. I will additionally combine BONCAT with a novel lysosome
immunoprecipitation (IP) method, LysoTag, to understand the causality of autophagic/lysosomal dysfunction in
age/AD NPT aberrations. Lastly, I will apply BONCAT to understand how microglia regulate NPT by (1) examining
neuronal protein uptake by microglia and (2) determining how deletion of Trem2, a microglia-specific AD risk
factor, alters NPT. Cumulatively, the proposal will address what NPT changes occur with aging/AD, how the
changes affect neuronal health and pathology, and how the lysosome and microglia act as intrinsic and extrinsic
regulators of NPT. Findings will hold promise to identify new targets to promote healthy brain aging. Through
continued training with the K99/R00 award, I will learn new methodologies (MS acquisition/analysis; lysosome
IP; targeted protein degradation) and concepts (proteostasis; autophagy) and participate in critical professional
development workshops/classes. The research and training proposed herein will empower me to be a successful
and impactful independent researcher and mentor."
10949016,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Metastatic relapse may occur in patients with ER+ breast cancer decades after original diagnosis. Most breast
cancer related deaths are caused by metastasis and thus identifying at-risk patients and developing therapies to
prevent reactivation are a crucial challenge. These efforts have been impeded by a lack of understanding of
cancer cell dormancy in the bone marrow, believed to be the cellular source of metastatic relapse. It is not well
understood how tumor cells interact with the bone marrow microenvironment and how these interactions regulate
tumor cell dormancy and escape. My proposed research seeks to develop a mouse model of dormancy and
investigate the spatial organization of the bone marrow niche in patient samples in the mentored K99 phase and
develop a biomaterial model of dormancy in the independent R00 phase. I hypothesize (i) cancer stem cells are
a subset of disseminated tumor cells responsible for metastatic relapse and (ii) the bone marrow niche, including
the healthy stem cell niche, facilitates dormancy and reactivation of these cells. In Aim 1, I will develop a novel
mouse model of hormone responsive breast cancer dormancy in bone marrow and evaluate the presence,
phenotype, and microenvironmental regulation of disseminated tumor cells using optical tissue clearing/3D
imaging of whole bone. In Aim 2, I will investigate the hypothesis that tumor cell interactions with the bone marrow
niche control tumor cell phenotype via high dimensional spatial analysis of bone marrow biopsies from patients
with breast cancer including imaging mass cytometry (IMC) and spatial single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq).
In Aim 3, I will develop a biomaterial model of the dormant bone marrow niche via creating mechanical mimics
of the three distinct compartments of bone marrow and evaluate the role of mechanosensing in induction and
maintenance of dormancy. In the K99 phase of the award, Prof Max Wicha will serve as my main mentor. Dr.
Wicha is a pioneer in the cancer stem cell field and is an expert in breast cancer biology and metastasis. I will
work with and consult my collaborators and mentoring team, including Prof Fei Wen (imaging mass cytometry),
Evan Keller (single cell spatial analysis program), Dr. Dafydd Thomas (pathology core), Prof Gary Luker
(microscopy), Prof Monika Burness (breast cancer clinical oncology) and Prof Sofia Merjaver (breast cancer
molecular biology). My K99 training will consist of developing a novel mouse model of bone marrow dormancy
and learning bioinformatics approaches to analyze spatial contributions to cellular phenotype in IMC and
scRNAseq data to propel me toward developing a synthetic dormant bone marrow niche mimic using
biomaterials during the independent R00 phase. In sum, the proposed research will address an urgent, unmet
need to identify the role of the bone marrow niche in breast cancer dormancy and reactivation, which may provide
a path forward for identifying patients at higher risk of metastasis and developing therapies against reactivation."

The Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT) is the only international scientific society
dedicated exclusively to the field of nicotine and tobacco research. SRNT has more than 1,100 members from
over 40 countries, with approximately 85 percent of those members being affiliated with U.S. institutions,
including universities, Federal agencies, research and related organizations. The overall objective of the SRNT
is to stimulate advancement in the field of nicotine and tobacco research through the presentation of timely and
cutting-edge research, discussion, and networking; this objective is largely carried out through presentation of
1,000+ papers/posters/symposia/plenary lectures at its Annual Meeting. It is the hallmark conference in the
field where investigators, advocates, and policymakers can learn about the latest scientific findings, including
novel products in the marketplace and effective interventions and policies to reduce tobacco use in the U.S.
and in other countries. The SRNT Annual Meeting provides a crucial venue for the presentation of the rapidly
evolving tobacco regulatory science research findings to the major keyholders in research and policy. The aims
of this conference grant are to: 1) ensure that tobacco regulatory science content is presented in ways that are
maximally informative to FDA and to researchers in the field; and 2) to support the career of trainees and early
career investigators in tobacco regulatory science via opportunities for special oral sessions, professional
development forums, travel awards, and other recognition. To meet both aims, SRNT’s Program Committee
will meet regularly throughout the year to plan the content and format of the SRNT 2024 Annual Meeting,
aligning the presentation of scientific content with research priorities in the Tobacco Regulatory Science
Program (TRSP). The Committee will curate paper sessions on specific topics that highlight advances in the
area, foster scientific discussion and debate, and stimulate collaboration across researchers. The conference
grant will also support 10 travel awards for trainees and early career investigators presenting on content
related to the FDA and NIH Tobacco Regulatory Science Program research priorities. These interactions will
facilitate the development of novel questions and approaches to tobacco regulatory science research and
support the careers of future researchers in tobacco regulatory science.
 Although 85% of SRNT members are based in the US, SRNT is an international membership
association. Therefor the Annual Meeting must be held outside the US periodically; the last non-US Annual
Meeting was held in 2017. While the 2024 Annual Meeting will take place in the UK the vast majority of
attendees and presenters will be from the United States as is the case every year. Furthermore, all conference
planning including abstract submission system development, management, and execution; Program
Committee support and Program development; website and mobile app development; online hosting of
sessions presented; grant and finance management; graphic design; and all other logistical arrangements
have been and will be managed exclusively in the US by SRNT’s management company, The Rees Group,
Inc, a small business in Madison, WI. No grant funds will be paid to any non-US vendor or company, and only
US residents will receive travel grants funded by this R13."

Research priorities for the Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) include “Evaluation of toxicity from exposures to
complex mixtures of tobacco-related constituents in ENDS aerosol, waterpipe smoke, cigar smoke, and
smokeless tobacco using toxicological assays such as in vivo, in silico, as well as in vitro models that are more
physiologically relevant to humans.” Although CTP regulatory guidance documents include genotoxicity and
other in vitro assays in the types of toxicity information required for submissions, there is no standardized
guidance or regulatory approved methods for the evaluation of various tobacco products, including ENDS.
Therefore, the Institute for In Vitro Sciences (IIVS), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, has organized a
Workshop Series to identify, discuss and develop recommendations for the best scientific/technical
approaches for generating and interpreting in vitro assay data for comparing toxicity within and across tobacco
product classes. Designed as true working meetings, expert stakeholders will discuss and develop
recommendations that will then be published. The initial focus of the series (2018 – 2023) has been on the use
of the regulatory genetic toxicology assays (Ames test, in vitro mammalian assays for cytogenetic damage and
gene mutation) with various types of tobacco and nicotine products. Going forward we will finalize
recommendations for the use of the genetic toxicology assays and transition to an emphasis on human in vitro
models of potential target tissue, some of which can be utilized as disease models. These workshops provide a
unique opportunity for multiple stakeholders to share their expertise and will provide published resources that
regulatory agencies, academic laboratories, and industry may use as they address the public health issues
related to the use of tobacco products. Some of workshop reports may serve as authoritative publications that
can be referenced for optimal methodologies and data interpretation. So far, the workshops (1-8) have
identified important issues for using in vitro assays for evaluating tobacco products and have focused on
several of CTP’s high-priority topics. Multiple working groups have been established to collect background
information, to hold discussions between workshops, and to develop recommendations that are discussed
during the workshops. Multiple sets of recommendations have resulted from these workshops. Four
manuscripts have been published, one is in press, and five are in preparation. “Recommendations for the use
of the in vitro mammalian micronucleus test to compare within and between tobacco and nicotine containing
products” will be addressed in Workshop 10, and “Considerations and methods to quantitatively compare
toxicity results within and among tobacco and nicotine containing products” will be addressed in Workshop 11."

Resource (CISR), a microscopy core with a 20+ year history of successful microscopy management, training,
and acquisition of new technology. This instrument capable of fast-freezing live or fixed samples in vitreous ice
for downstream applications including freeze-substitution TEM, cryo-FIBSEM, and cryo-ET. This equipment is
essential to progress the research of the 7 Major Users within Vanderbilt and the VBI with projects surrounding
neuronal cell biology, synapse assembly and plasticity, synaptic signaling, glutamate receptors, and
communication between cell populations. These molecular and cellular investigations will advance already
funded NIMH and NIH projects totaling over $4M in FY23 in the areas of psychiatric disorders, Alzheimer’s, ALS,
learning and memory, Rett syndrome (RTT), childhood neurodegenerative diseases and more.
The proposed high-pressure freezing system is based on the needs of the VBI and Major Users to capture
neuronal processes with the highest resolution and fidelity possible to understand fundamental advance these
NIMH and NIH funded projects. The Leica EM ICE high-pressure freezer includes: 1) The base unit high-
pressure freezing that uses pressurized liquid nitrogen to both generate pressure and cool samples
simultaneously; 2) Electric and light stimulation modules to capture synaptic events at the point of freezing 3) A
cell and tissue incubator system to load live samples into the EM ICE; 4) Sapphire based freezing modules to
allow correlative light and electron microscopy either before or after freezing, and conventional flat carriers for
freeze-substitution and freeze-fracture/etch applications. This system would be housed in renovated electron
microscopy suite in Medical Center North which is directly adjacent to the VBI and the majority of the User labs.
Vanderbilt University is providing financial support to promote the long-term operation of the instrument. If
awarded, the Office of the Dean of Basic Sciences is committed to providing $75,896 for CISR service contracts,
staff salary, computer purchases and upgrades, and reduction in user fees over the first 5 years. Technical
support and training of new users will be facilitated by the exceptional staff within the CISR, which has a greater
than 20-year history of assisting over 300 labs on campus in both sample preparation and imaging. Moreover,
this equipment will be housed in newly renovated electron microscopy space that is centrally located near the
Major User group. Collectively, the proposed high-pressure freezing system, together with outstanding
institutional and core facility support, will enable the long-term objective of supporting and advancing
neuroscience and mental health research Vanderbilt."

Candidate: Mark K. Meiselbach is an early career health economist and health services researcher. His long-
term career goal is to become a leading mental health services researcher whose research informs policies to
improve access to mental and behavioral health treatment for underserved populations.
Research Context: There is a growing mental health crisis among older adults, but most older adults with
mental illness do not receive treatment. This may be exacerbated by the rapid growth of Medicare Advantage
(MA), which now enrolls most Medicare beneficiaries, as Dr. Meiselbach’s recent work shows that few
psychiatrists accept MA plans compared to traditional Medicare or other forms of insurance. There is a critical
need to understand access to mental health specialists in MA and how networks for mental health specialists
in MA impact mental health care and outcomes for older adults.
Specific Aims: Using Medicare claims data with novel data linkages, we will 1) characterize variation in
geographic access to mental health specialists for older adults; 2) evaluate the impact of access to in-network
mental health specialists in MA on utilization of mental health care and clinical outcomes among older adults in
MA; and 3) investigate patient- and provider-level factors that modify the impact of access to in-network mental
health specialists on utilization of mental health care and clinical outcomes.
Career Development Plan: Dr. Meiselbach has a strong foundation in health policy, economics, and
econometrics and substantial experience working with administrative claims data and other large databases.
To achieve his long-term career goals, however, he needs to bolster his skillset to better understand how the
quantitative findings of his research relate to the experience of patients and clinicians and how to translate
these findings to meaningful policy change. Through this K01 career development award, he will receive
training to 1) enhance his clinical understanding of mental health treatment in older adults, 2) gain expertise in
geospatial measurement and modeling, 3) become expert in causal inference in mental health research, and 4)
develop independence and leadership skills to inform policies that improve access to mental health care. Dr.
Meiselbach’s mentorship team includes experts in mental health services research, geriatrics and geriatric
psychiatry, spatial statistics, causal inference, economics, and policy dissemination.
Research Goals: The goal of this research is to evaluate the impact of access to mental health specialists on
older adults and identify the geographic areas and factors associated with worse access. Provider networks in
MA are a mutable policy target. These findings can directly inform policies, such as network adequacy
regulation, to improve access to mental health care and outcomes for older adults. The proposed study is
closely aligned with NIMH’s strategic goal 4 to: Advance Mental Health Services to Strengthen Public Health,
Objective 4.1: Improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and reach of mental health services through research."

THIRD COAST CFAR: OVERALL
The broad, long-term mission of the Third Coast Center for AIDS Research (TC CFAR) is to use our
trans-disciplinary collaborations to power transformational advances across the translational spectrum
from discovery to implementation of effective interventions - and end HIV. Many local resources at
Northwestern University (UC), the University of Chicago (UC), and community partners have been, and
will continue to be, brought to bear on this mission. The allowable Funded Research Base (FRB)
increased by 47%, and projects became more trans-disciplinary, from FY14 to FY18. Nimble and
opportunistic strategic planning (by the Administrative Core, AC) and robust growth in seed funding
and mentoring programs (by the Developmental Core, DC) led to those successes, and to choosing
specific, high-priority HIV research topics as foci for a second term. Institutional support has increased.
The Overall scientific aims were also chosen based on each of the 3 scientific Cores having a user
base and expert resources with strengths on each aim. Each of these Cores has also worked to extend
their resources and expertise to researchers outside their own domains, and thereby helped build
collaborations. The following Overall aims build on our solid foundation, and will direct each scientific
Core, in concert with the AC and the DC, to synergistically advance the science needed to end HIV.
Overall Aim 1: To continue and expand collaborative research that will slow, and eventually stop, the
HIV epidemic by improving continuums of HIV prevention and care.
Overall Aim 2: To advance understanding of accelerated aging-related illnesses (non-AIDS
comorbidities) that occur despite suppression of HIV viremia.
Overall Aim 3: To speed discovery and empower development of transformative scientific innovations
that will improve HIV prevention and treatment for persons living with HIV."
10948994,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a recalcitrant cancer that causes 250,000 deaths
worldwide each year. Patients with SCLC initially respond to cytotoxic therapies but almost
invariably relapse with therapy resistant disease. Moreover, when diagnosed, many patients have
metastases in distant organs including the liver, which represents a major impediment to
successful therapy. The metastatic cascade involves cancer cell interactions with many normal
cell types, which are thought to provide by pro- and anti-metastatic signals. Recent studies have
shown that endothelial cells (ECs) play important and diverse roles in metastasis of different
cancer types. However, our understanding of the molecular and cellular interactions between
SCLC cells and ECs in liver metastasis remains incomplete and no therapies exist to prevent or
stop these interactions, which marks great therapeutic possibilities for target treatment for SCLC
patients in clinic. In this proposed study, I hypothesize that SCLC-EC interactions alter the cell
state of both cell types and these changes are critical for SCLC liver metastasis. To
systemically study the reciprocal interactions between SCLC cells and ECs, I have developed an
innovative method to qualitatively record physical interactions between various cell types (GFP-
based Touching Nexus, G-baToN). Meanwhile, my mentors' labs have generated somatic
CRISPR genome editing mouse models and high-throughput tumor barcode sequencing
platforms which I will employ to deconvolute metastatic burden, metastatic seeding, and clonal
expansion in SCLC liver metastasis. By leveraging all these cutting-edge techniques, this project
aims to characterize the role of SCLC-activated ECs in SCLC liver metastasis through studying
the function of the CXCLs-CXCR2 axis (Aim 1) and other cell-cell interaction related EC genes
(Aim 2). On the other hand, this project will also quantitatively assess the impact of EC-induced
SCLC alternations in liver metastasis (Aim 3). Taken together, this project will uncover new
mechanistic insights in SCLC metastasis, establish new strategies for investigating cancer-
stromal interactions in vitro and in vivo, and identify new therapeutic possibilities to better treat
SCLC patients."
10948999,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Early onset breast cancer (BC) incidence has increased dramatically worldwide, including in the U.S. where the
greatest increase has occurred in young non-Hispanic Black (NHB) women. Identifying the modifiable causes of
early onset BC is critical for reducing health inequities, a top priority for public health and BC prevention, and
addresses one of the NCI’s 2020 provocative questions on the etiology of cancers in adults under age 40.
Physical activity in adulthood is an established risk factor for cancer, and the long latency of tumorigenesis
suggests that physical activity in adolescence may play an important role in the development of early onset BC.
However, there is currently limited epidemiologic data, especially from racially diverse cohorts, to support this. It
is essential that we address this major gap in the evidence-base. The overarching goal of this study is to elucidate
the role of adolescent physical activity in the risk of and outcomes from early onset BC, including whether
physical activity impacts breast tissue biomarkers in adolescent girls and young women. Aim 1 (K99) will evaluate
adolescent physical activity in association with early onset BC risk and outcomes after diagnosis in young women
across the continuum of BC susceptibility using survival modeling approaches coupled with causal methods,
including Mendelian randomization and sibling set analyses. This aim will use existing data from a racially diverse
family-based cohort of 31,640 women that is enriched for BC family history (BCFH) and includes 7,703 (1,422
NHB or Hispanic) women diagnosed with BC before age 50 (3,108 diagnosed before age 40). Aim 2 (K99) will
determine if physical activity is associated with intermediate markers of BC risk in adolescent girls, including
timing of breast development and breast tissue composition (BTC) measured by optical spectroscopy (OS). This
aim will use existing prospective data from two adolescent cohorts, including a multiethnic cohort of 1,040 girls
that is enriched for BCFH and a cohort of 216 NHB and Hispanic girls in NYC. Aim 3 (R00) will evaluate if
adolescent physical activity is associated with structural and metabolic differences in the breast tissue of young
women under age 40 and determine if these alterations are associated with early onset BC risk. This aim will be
completed during the independent R00 phase by conducting a case-control study in 150 women under age 40,
newly diagnosed with BC, and 300 matched controls (sample ≥50% NHB or Hispanic). BTC will be measured in
cases and controls using OS and mammography. Taken together, this study will provide the most comprehensive
evaluation of adolescent physical activity and early onset BC to date, which is needed to move the field of BC
prevention research forward in developing novel intervention strategies for populations at increased risk of early
onset disease. This research will be complemented by experiential and didactic training in molecular and genetic
epidemiology, advanced statistical methods, physical activity research, and intervention design, as well as career
development activities. This K99/R00 award will thus facilitate the long-term career objective of leading an
independent research program studying modifiers of cancer risk that are amenable to early life intervention."
10947143,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Soil-transmitted parasitic nematodes infect over a billion people around the world and can cause devastating
and sometimes fatal illness. Despite this massive health burden, the biology of parasitic nematodes remains
almost entirely unexplored. For example, we lack basic knowledge about the physiological specializations and
sensory behaviors that enable these gastrointestinal parasites to locate and infect hosts - processes that could
be targets for novel therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, virtually nothing is known about how parasitism of
mammals arose, multiple times independently, from the evolutionarily conserved genomes, neural circuits, and
physiology of nematodes.
I have developed the potentially fatal human parasite Strongyloides stercoralis as a powerful new model to
investigate the sensory adaptations of species with direct relevance to global health. In this proposal, we aim
to understand how temperature cues shape the specialized behavioral and physiological responses of
soil-transmitted parasitic nematodes. This proposal is a unique approach that centers the underlying biology
the human parasites themselves and lies at the intersection between parasitology, neuroscience, genetics, and
molecular biology. Our central hypothesis is that parasitism of mammals requires dramatic shifts in
thermal behavior and physiology that arise from an evolutionarily common cluster of molecular and
cellular adaptations. First, we leverage high-resolution quantitative behavioral assays to define the role of
temperature in driving the parasite-specific behaviors and physiological responses of S. stercoralis across their
complex life cycle, experiments we hope will establish a new platform for the development of novel therapies
that block the remarkable ability of parasitic worms to locate human hosts and survive the extreme thermal
environments of their bodies. Next, we will map the neural circuits underlying thermosensation in S. stercoralis,
using newly optimized tools for studying neuronal function in parasitic worms. These experiments will reveal the
cellular links between thermal behaviors and molecular substrates and resolve how worm neural circuits evolved
to support human parasitism. Finally, we will leverage our expertise in the comparative and functional parasite
genomics to identify the genetic and molecular substrates of parasite-specific thermosensory responses in
Strongyloides and other parasitic nematode species; a first, critical step towards designing novel and broadly
effective anti-parasitic drugs capable of disrupting infections. The results of these studies will reveal key
mechanisms underlying the unique thermal adaptability of mammalian parasitic nematodes, providing
an essential foundation to enable the development of novel interventional strategies. Although focused
on soil-transmitted parasitic nematodes, if successful this work should provide insights into other helminths, such
as schistosomes, which also actively invade mammalian hosts."

10951932,"Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a relatively new non-invasive electrical stimulation
technique (tES) where a sinusoidal oscillating low-voltage electric current is applied to the brain through
electrodes on the scalp. TACS is investigated for a broad range of medical and performance indications to
manipulate brain activity. The physiological mechanisms underlying tACS effects are still under debate. The
effects of tACS are generally mixed and controversial since they depend on many stimulation parameters, such
as stimulation duration, intensity, electrodes montage and size, stimulation phase, and frequency. Therefore,
further pre-clinical mechanistic investigation is needed to reach a comprehensive understanding of tACS effects.
Understanding the cellular mechanisms of tACS will increase the rigor of enduring studies and provide a rational
foundation for dose optimization. The majority of mechanistic studies have focused exclusively on the direct
effects of tACS on neuronal membranes. A recent study showed that tACS rapidly and transiently increases
cerebral blood flow in anesthetized mice, but the mechanism remained unclear. In previous studies, we have
demonstrated nitric oxide-dependent direct effects on cerebral vascular endothelium and microcirculation of
another tES modality – transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). However, the dose-dependent effects and
the NOS subtype involved were not studied and thus unknown. Drs. Mersedeh Bahr-Hosseini and Marom
Bikson, in the recent review in Brain Stimulation Journal, concluded that a primary vascular effect of transcranial
electrostimulation is highly suggested based on various preclinical and clinical studies and that further studies
are warranted to investigate the mechanisms underlying the vascular response. Based on our results obtained
for tDCS and considering that the effects of tACS and tDCS might be both similar and dissimilar, we propose to
test the hypothesis that tES directly and transiently modulates the endothelial function of microvasculature, which
could modulate neuronal activity. Thus, the objective of the proposed work is to dissect and differentiate the
mechanisms of tACS and tDCS effects on vascular endothelium and cerebral microcirculation. The rationale is
that tACS and tDCS facilitate sustained nitric oxide-dependent changes in cerebral microvasculature and so in
the neuronal microenvironment. The approach includes in-vivo awake multiphoton laser scanning microscopy of
cerebral microvascular tone, circulation, and blood-brain barrier permeability during and after tACS and tDCS
with the use of nitric oxide synthase modulators and eNOS and nNOS knockout mice and the determination of
molecular responses of microvascular endothelium. As understanding each cellular target of stimulation is
necessary for a complete mechanism, the modulation of microvasculature by tACS and tDCS, combined with
neuronal effects, is significant and innovative to research. This proposed research will determine the feasibility
of the direct effects of tACS and tDCS on cerebral microvasculature and foresee the influence of these changes
on neuronal activity."
10947250,"Abstract
The prevalence of multidrug resistance in Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Acinetobacter baumannii) is rising at an alarming rate, rendering many (if not all) antibiotics ineffective when
used alone. The rate of new drug development is unlikely to keep pace with the increase in multidrug
resistance. Combination therapy is often used clinically as a last resort. However, considering the numerous
possibilities, combination therapy are selected by clinicians mostly based on anecdotal experience and
intuition. A robust method to guide rational selection of combination therapy would be crucial to delay returning
to the pre-antibiotic era.
Our long-term goal is to optimize clinical use of antibiotics to combat the emergence of resistance. The
objective of this application is to refine a novel precision medicine platform (monitoring device and data
processing algorithm) that will guide the design of combination therapy. If short-term experimental data can be
used to predict the response of patient-specific bacteria to clinically relevant antibiotic exposures, effective
treatment strategies could be formulated rationally by identifying the best possible combination. Clinicians
could be guided in the selection of combination therapy, without comprehensively knowledge of the resistance
mechanism(s) involved. We plan to accomplish the objective of the application as follows: (1) identify useful
antibiotic combinations against multidrug resistant bacteria; and (2) validate the mathematical model
predictions with clinical outcomes.
In this application, the proposed approach will be illustrated by experimental data with P. aeruginosa, A.
baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, the proposed model-based system is not confined to a
specific antimicrobial agent - pathogen combination. It could be extrapolated to other antimicrobial agents
(e.g., antibacterials, antifungals and antiretrovirals) with different mechanisms of action, as well as to other
pathogens (e.g., Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Candida auris, and HIV) with different microbiological characteristics."
10946969,"Learning and memory is profoundly impaired in patients with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) and Alzheimer’s
Disease (AD), with devastating consequences on everyday actions such as the ability to safely navigate back
home. Temporal lobe structures such as the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus are critical for
the brain’s ability to create, update, and use internal representations of a dynamic external world. While decades
of research have revealed how MEC neurons—whose firing rate and patterns encode an animal’s position,
orientation, and speed in the environment—can build a static, reliable “map” of the physical environment, less is
known about how these maps can be flexibly updated to meet changing behavioral demands. Specifically, how
are abstract cognitive features, such as having to avoid an accident-prone traffic intersection or pick up groceries
on the way home, integrated into neural maps of the environment to guide behavior? Better understanding the
neural circuits and computations which govern flexible spatial processing in MEC is a crucial step towards
identifying vulnerabilities in the entorhinal-hippocampal network which may be targeted to alleviate cognitive
impairments. Recent advances in high-density electrophysiological recording techniques have generated critical
insights about the organization and diversity of information encoded by MEC neurons. In parallel, advances in
3D video recordings techniques and machine-learning algorithms have unlocked access to the rich dynamics of
rodent behavior. In this proposal, we combine these state-of-the-art techniques to densely sample single-unit
neural activity and behavioral dynamics at high resolution in freely-moving mice performing tasks associated
with different cognitive demands, while deploying optogenetic perturbations and an unbiased statistical model of
neural encoding. This strategy will allow us to rigorously assess how diverse physical and abstract features of
the environment are encoded by hundreds of simultaneously recorded neurons across brain regions. Our
overarching hypothesis is that flexible transformations of MEC maps are shaped by distinct neural circuits
conveying physical versus abstract features of the environment. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that changes
in cognitive demands transform neural maps by recruiting a diverse repertoire of spatial and behavioral variables
to be flexibly encoded by MEC neurons. In Aim 2, we will examine if changes in physical features of the
environment drive coordinated transformations of spatial representations across MEC and upstream regions
such as the anterior thalamic nucleus. In Aim 3, we will determine if cognitive signals conveyed by the thalamic
nucleus reuniens enable transformations of MEC spatial representations. This proposal will identify circuit-level
substrates that influence which, when, and how transformations of MEC representations occur. By revealing how
flexible MEC spatial processing is orchestrated by two thalamic regions which, alongside MEC and hippocampus
exhibit pathological hallmarks in TLE and AD, this work will advance our understanding of entorhinal-
hippocampal network function in health and disease."
10973547,"Justification: High inpatient readmissions among Veterans with SUDs constitutes a costly and persistent
healthcare problem. VHA Handbook 1160.06 guides the development and implementation of recovery-oriented
mental health (MH) services, although significant service gaps remain on VA inpatient settings. ‘Combined
Recovery Program (CRP)’ is designed to address these gaps by enhancing stabilization of Veterans with SUDs
beyond hospital discharge and consists of ‘Group Motivational Interviewing’, an adaptation of motivational
interviewing; and ‘Life Skills for Housing Maintenance’, involving skills training for enhancing housing stability.
To be added to CRP, Stable & Able (S&A) is a VA Home Telehealth (HT) nurse-monitored program providing
assessment and self-management skills in the post-hospitalization phase.
Gaps Addressed: This proposal addresses VA research priorities: access to care and MH, benefitting Veterans
with SUDs. A significant proportion of these Veterans exhibit homelessness and suicidality. Study objectives
address SAIL MH Composite measures ‘PDE1’ to increase Post-Discharge Treatment Engagement in MH care;
and ‘HRF7’ to increase care processes for Veterans at high risk for suicide. During the COVID-19 pandemic,
telehealth solutions offer safe treatment options as well as reduce isolation.
Innovativeness: This proposal is consistent with 2018 MISSION Act in priority areas: mental illness, SUD, and
housing instability via a technology-enabled format and through addressing gaps in the current inpatient recovery
model involving limited availability of staff training in and availability of recovery-oriented services. CRP and S&A
present innovative/novel interventions ready for deployment. Both CRP and S&A were designed specifically to
assist high risk Veterans with SUDs to remain stably housed. S&A is conveniently provided via App using an
iPad, cell phone, or the Medtronic Commander Flex and allows 3 mos. of daily monitoring by trained HT staff.
Specific Aim I: Assess the relative effects of Treatment Engagement and Substance Use [and SUD-related
problems] between CRP+S&A vs. CRP and CRP+S&A vs. TAU by 3-mos follow-up.
Primary Hypothesis 1a: Treatment Engagement: Participants in CRP + S&A will attend more outpatient SUD
treatment sessions and general MH treatment sessions compared to participants in CRP and to TAU.
Primary Hypothesis 1b: Substance Use: Participants in CRP + S&A will lower quantity and frequency of
substance use and SUD-related problems compared to participants in CRP and to TAU.
 Secondary Hypothesis 1c: Preventable Services: Participants in CRP + S&A will reduce Preventable
 Healthcare Services (hospital readmissions and ED visits) compared to participants in CRP and to TAU.
 Secondary Hypothesis 1d: Participants in CRP + S&A will report Greater QoL; # of Days Living in Stable
 Housing; and # of Days Engaging in Community Events and/or Activities compared to CRP and to TAU.
Specific Aim II: Conduct Veteran participant thematic interviews and Staff ‘focus’ interviews to assess qualitative
facilitators and barriers to implementation.
Project Methods: 195 Veterans with SUDs in the Charleston VAMC inpatient setting will be recruited.
Participants will be randomly assigned to: (1) CRP + S&A; (2) CRP; and (3) TAU. Participants will be followed-
up at 1 and 3-months and data analyzed using mixed methods. Investigators of this project plan to evaluate
implementation of the interventions proposed in other VA inpatient programs within the VISN through future
implementation projects and will utilize study findings in partnership for improving SAIL performance measures.
Description of Primary Outcomes: A. Treatment Engagement (measured in SUD and general MH treatment
sessions attended); B. Substance Use (measured in quantity and frequency) and SUD-related problems.
Secondary outcomes: C. Preventable Services (measured in hospital readmissions and ED visits) and D. Quality
of Life, #Days Living in Stable Housing, and # Days Engaging in Community Events and/or Activities."

Mutations in the ZEB2 transcription factor (TF) gene are the cause of Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MOWS), an
intellectual and developmental disability (IDD). While MOWS is due primarily to large deletions or premature
stop codons in ZEB2, little is known about rare missense variants in the gene. To date, there has not been a
genome-wide identification of ZEB2 DNA binding sites and its target genes in IDD-relevant cells. This proposal
aims to fill this knowledge gap using modified protocols developed in the Myers Lab for chromatin
immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). The proposal applies these methods
to identify the wild-type (WT) ZEB2 binding sites in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as well as in
neuronal cells differentiated from these iPSCs; these cell types are highly relevant for IDD research. The lab’s
recently published method for assaying missense variants in TF genes will be used to perform the experiment
for five clinically-identified variants across domains of the ZEB2 gene. Differential binding will be assessed in
these variant cells, as well as the genomic association sites for two essential cofactors for ZEB2: SMAD1 and
CTBP1. This information will further clarify both WT and mutant ZEB2 functional activity. Finally, analytical
methods will be used to establish likely target genes for ZEB2 regulatory activity, and RNA-seq will be
performed to measure gene expression, correlating differential expression in variant cell lines with differential
binding. This work will be highly impactful for ZEB2 and MOWS research and future clinical diagnoses and will
lay the foundation for potential therapeutic interventions."
10954139,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Skipping the hospital: Acute hospital care at home for people living with dementia
 In 2020, Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) affected 5.8 million Americans and
represented the fastest growing segment of our population.1 It was the sixth leading cause of death in the US;
1 in 3 older adults died of ADRD; and cost of care was $305 billion. A constant for people living with dementia
(PLWD) is hospitalization: PLWD are hospitalized at twice the rate as older adults without ADRD.2,3 Well-
documented is the harm of hospitalization: 1 in 3 will lose functional status; 1 in 5 will become delirious.4,5 The
harm of hospitalization is magnified in PLWD: they have 5 times the odds of an adverse event.6,7
 Acute hospital care at home (AHCaH) was specifically developed as a substitutive delivery model to
help avoid these common harms for older adults while receiving the care that they need at home. The
current model provides hospital-level care in the home after presenting to the emergency department (ED) with
an acute illness such as infection or heart failure. AHCaH includes twice daily in-home nurse visits, daily
physician visits, physical and occupational therapy, intravenous medications, biometric monitoring, in-home
diagnostics, home health aide care, and 24/7 response. Serious illness conversations (SICs) at home for
applicable patients are essential for setting goals of care and ideal given the home environment. Prior studies
including several randomized controlled trials demonstrated significant improvements in 30-day readmission,
safety, and cost.8–15 The impact on family caregivers and clinicians caring for PLWD is understudied. The
mechanism of action for home hospital is patients are more physically active, sleep better, have more days at
home in a familiar environment with improved locus of control and experience, and have less hospital-acquired
disability.”16 Home hospital care is now approved at over 296 hospitals in 37 states.
 There exists a critical need to better serve PLWD and their family caregivers when they become acutely ill.
Despite its focus on older adults, few home hospital efforts specifically target PLWD and may decline such
patients due to insufficient family caregiver support in the home, perceived risk of caring for PLWD in the
home, and lack of clear goals of care. We propose a 3-part PLWD-specific year-long pre-enrolled AHCaH
pathway: 1) in-home SIC and caregiver resourcing; 2) video and in-home acute illness evaluation on demand
including mobile integrated health paramedic and home health aide; and 3) as needed and as appropriate
AHCaH with additional ADRD resources including home health aide care and delirium prevention measures.
Our overarching aim is to implement and evaluate (NIH Stage III) an AHCaH pathway specifically for
PLWD that will serve as a national model. We will evaluate in a randomized controlled trial the effect of a pre-
enrollment AHCaH pathway on quality of life over 12 months for persons with moderate to severe dementia
(Aim 1). We will evaluate the experiences of family caregivers using a mixed-methods approach (quantitative
and qualitative) in both pre-enrolled home hospital and usual care (Aim 2)."
10953849,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are common and debilitating conditions. Financial
hardship, a multidimensional construct of financial strain, financial stress and asset depletion, is common in
AD/ADRD due to exorbitant out-of-pocket spending such as for long-term care, lower work productivity and
income for their caregivers that can last for decades after disease onset, and difficulty deciding between
nursing home care or home-based care while negotiating insurance coverage. People from historically
marginalized groups can experience a double disparity with fewer financial resources to manage AD/ADRD
and a greater risk of AD/ADRD. Screening for financial hardship in AD/ADRD is key for addressing the needs
of patients and caregivers but critical barriers include a lack of suitable screening measures. Current measures
are very general and meant for people without chronic medical conditions or are specific to other diseases. To
fill this gap, this study will create a suite of measures that can screen for financial hardship in people with
AD/ADRD and their families and caregivers. The measures will include a set to assess caregiver burden; a set
to assess patient hardship as reported by the caregiver for patients who cannot report for themselves; and a
set of patient-reported measures for patients that are able to report for themselves. To create these financial
hardship screening measures, the project will conduct the following aims. Aim 1- Develop financial hardship
screening measures for Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: Using interviews with both caregivers and
people with AD/ADRD, key indicators of financial hardship that are unique to AD/ADRD and the point in the
lifespan in which it occurs will be identified. The ways that social and caregiver network size affect financial
hardship will also be explored. Using the interviews and previous measures, preliminary measures will be
created and will be reviewed by experts and a patient and caregiver advisory board. Aim 2- Create item
response theory-based screening measures for financial hardship measures in Alzheimer's Disease and
related dementias: Large samples of people with AD/ADRD (n=1000) and caregivers (n=1000) will be surveyed
and item response theory will be used to evaluate and revise the measures and create scoring algorithms. A
sample of additional caregivers matched to primary caregivers (n=400) will also be recruited to evaluate
interrater reliability of the measures. Aim 3- Evaluate the financial hardship measures across patient and
caregiver populations: Using the sample from Aim 2 and item response theory, we will evaluate the financial
hardship screening measures across the following groups to ensure they are unbiased and reflect true
differences: race/ethnicity; patient comorbidities; stage of AD/ADRD; caregiver relationship; social network
size; number of caregivers; financial support provided; and caregiver's own health status (disability,
comorbidities). The resulting measures will improve identification of financial hardship in AD/ADRD."

Cancer diagnosis, treatment, and management can challenge romantic relationships. For individuals in
committed partnerships, cancer is a dyadic endeavor that requires interpersonal communication to adapt to the
couples’ new reality. For individuals who have been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer (MBC), effective
communication with their partner(s) is especially important for providing support and sustaining closeness.
Maintaining sexual intimacy, in particular, has been linked to positive cancer management outcomes and
quality of life for individuals with breast cancer. Communication can help facilitate sexual well-being and is
especially important in the advanced stages of breast cancer when partners must establish new norms and
expectations for expressing their sexual desire and intimacy. Despite the importance of sexuality for metastatic
breast cancer patients (MBCPs) and their partners, little research has explored how MBCPs communicate
about the impact of breast cancer on sexuality and intimacy. Identifying specific forms and features of talk that
may help or hinder couples as they navigate intimacy in the context of MBC is a pivotal first step in
understanding if and how communication can benefit individual and relational well-being. The proposed pilot
study has three aims: 1) to identify themes in MBCPs’ communication about sexuality and intimacy; 2) to
determine whether specific features of communication are associated with the sexual satisfaction, relational
satisfaction, and individual well-being of MBCPs; and 3) to determine the feasibility of collecting data on
sexuality and intimacy from partners of MBCPs. Pilot data will be collected via an online survey of 82 MBCPs.
The survey will consist of validated scales and open-ended questions. Participants will have the option to
respond to the open-ended questions using Phonic, an audio-recording survey software, increasing
accessibility for MBCPs with a range of abilities. Feasibility of collecting additional data from 25% of MCBPs’
partners will also be determined, and concordance between MBCPs’ and their partners’ communication will be
explored. Thematic analysis, correlations, and an exploratory mediation model will be employed to address the
study aims. Using a communication-based approach, this project will provide preliminary data regarding the
relationships between communication and sexual, relational, and individual well-being, and determine the
feasibility of collecting data from partners of individuals with MBC. The findings of the pilot study will address
the dearth of research on communication about sexuality among MBCPs and identify forms and features of
communication that MBCPs find beneficial when navigating sexuality and intimacy in their relationship."
10954670,"IMPRINT for ADRD will consist of two key tracks, combining immersion in the lived experiences
of people affected by Alzheimer’s with training in key aspects of entrepreneurship. Specifically,
the course will include lessons on key elements of biology and pathophysiology, as well as the
social & lifestyle determinants that impact an ADRD patient’s health. It will include an
exploration of novel design solutions, such as a digital phenotyping, as well as data science
tools to elucidate options for earlier detection and prevention. In addition, participants will
observe and potentially engage with patients in their care environments through in-field
ethnography. Entrepreneurship training will provide an immersive, inductive learning approach
to guide participants and teams on the path from ideation to market, including how to define a
problem, methodical approach to solution development. Together, these two tracks combine a
patient-centric, technical, and ethical methods that will help participants develop effective,
inclusive and comprehensive evidence-based interventions and/or treatments to enhance
outcomes for people aﬀected by Alzheimer’s and related dementia diseases.
The program will be built on best practices for healthcare-related innovation and
entrepreneurship. Key components of the program will be led by academic and industry
experts in Alzheimer’s and related dementias, clinical development and evaluation, FDA, legal
and regulatory issues, entrepreneurship, SBIR/STTR grant writing, and more. We will
collaborate with colleagues and programs from UC Berkeley, UC San Francisco, industry,
foundations, memory care centers, and other relevant stakeholders and/or partners.
The pedagogical approach will combine project based learning to foster discovery of solutions
with adult social learning theory (e,g, cooperative learning, building on each subsequent
activity, reinforced by in-ﬁeld interactions with senior care centers and health technology
companies.
Program participants will comprise a cohort of 12-15 graduate students and postdocs from
diverse backgrounds, disciplines, and interests, with a focus on attracting applicants from
underrepresented communities. The IMPRINT program is a one-year, hybrid model, with 15
days of immersive interactive (~12 days at course launch and 5 days at the end) that will cover
team building, site visits, prototyping sessions, and final presentations, combined with weekly
remote sessions (2 hrs/session x 2 sessions/week). Participants will receive a Certificate in
Entrepreneurship & Technology in ADRD upon completion."
10950246,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The proposed K01 application will strongly support Dr. Raymond Hernandez's long-term career goal of
developing tools usable in interventions to promote efficient and effective recovery from strain. In the recovery
from work literature, strain refers to effects (e.g., on affect, physiology, fatigue levels, etc.) of exposure to
stressors or any other demands. The symptoms of strain can be alleviated with sufficient engagement in
recovery activities. If strain is allowed to accumulate however, it can lead to negative outcomes such as
increased likelihood and absenteeism and lower job performance. Strain is frequently allowed to accrue
because its symptoms are often unobservable and there are no established objective strain measures, making
strain easier to ignore. In the US, insufficient recovery from work-related stress and associated strain has been
estimated to cost $125 billion annually from productivity losses and healthcare spending.
The proposed K01 study aims to perform secondary data analysis on several existing datasets to investigate
whether digital health technology tools that measure physiological functions such as heart rate variability
(HRV) and performance-based measures such as mobile cognitive testing can serve as objective indicators of
strain. This application is in response to the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
strategic goal to “promote safe and healthy work design and well-being”, particularly its intermediate goals
focused on “Total Worker Health”. It is also in response to the Healthy Work Design and Well-Being cross-
sector objective of promoting a sustainable work-nonwork interface.
Mentored research towards completion of study aims will be supplemented with structured career development
activities. These activities will fill critical gaps in Dr. Hernandez's past training by enabling him to achieve the
following career goals: developing knowledge of passively collected physiological data, learning nuances of
ambulatory cognitive assessment, obtaining knowledge of factors influencing use of mobile health technologies
(e.g., how to promote uptake of mobile technologies by healthcare systems), and professional development for
career scientists (e.g., grant writing). I will be supported by a highly qualified mentorship team, and by the
outstanding training environment provided to young researchers by the University of Southern California.
A desired end outcome is for mobile measures of cognitive performance and HRV to augment existing worker
recovery interventions as objective measures of strain levels, usable by occupational health practitioners (e.g.,
to monitor and document progress in recovery interventions), employers, and employees. An expected
intermediate outcome is an R01 proposal for more rigorous validity/usability tests of mobile strain indicators.
Expected outputs after completion of this proposal include multiple publications that illuminate the types of
HRV/cognition measures with associations with strain, and Dr. Hernandez's attainment of the expertise
necessary to develop novel ways of utilizing digital health technologies to help reduce workers' strain levels."
10972774,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Natural scenes are cluttered with multiple objects that compete for neural representation due to limited
processing capacity. Mechanisms for selective processing, broadly referred to as visual attention, are therefore
needed to prioritize relevant stimuli. Classic studies of spatial attention have largely ignored its temporal
dynamics, assuming that associated neural and behavioral effects were continuous for the duration of attentional
deployment. Recent studies, however, have provided compelling evidence, in both humans and monkeys, that
spatial attention fluctuates over time, sampling the environment in theta-rhythmic cycles (~4-8 Hz), associated
with alternating periods of either enhanced or diminished perceptual sensitivity. We have begun to uncover the
neural basis for the rhythmic properties of spatial attention, both in humans and monkeys, across the large-scale
network that subserves attention. We found that the phase of intrinsic theta rhythms across fronto-parietal cortex
and, in macaques, also in the pulvinar, predicted behavioral outcome. Neural evidence suggests that theta
rhythms organize neural population activity into two alternating states: One that promotes sampling visual
information from the presently attended location, and another one that promotes shifting attention to a new
location in the visual field. We have synthesized our findings and previous evidence into a novel framework, a
rhythmic theory of attention. Based on this framework, our central hypothesis for the proposed project is that
low-frequency rhythms serve as a clocking mechanism to coordinate sensory and motor processes in the
attention system and that these rhythms flexibly adjust to changing behavioral demands (e.g., varying cueing
context). Using identical attention tasks in humans and macaques, we will establish common behavioral patterns
and relate them to intracranial neural activity in both species. This approach aids in developing models for human
brain function, bridging the mesoscopic level of human intracranial EEG to cell-type specific neural population
dynamics (e.g., laminar recordings) and causal manipulations (e.g., electrical microstimulation) obtainable in an
animal model. Further, our studies will be among the first to record from the human thalamus. We will use
‘behavior-as-glue’ to guide our comparison of neural mechanisms across primate species and levels of analyses.
Specifically, we will (i) investigate mechanisms for coordinating functional conflicts between visual and motor
processes across the human brain and in functionally specialized populations of neurons in macaque FEF, LIP
and pulvinar, (ii) investigate mechanisms for fronto-parietal and thalamic control in organizing visual processes
(including in macaque V4 at the laminar level), and (iii) investigate a causal role for pulvino-cortical interactions
in shaping attention behaviors. Impairments of selective attention have devastating consequences on human
health (e.g., after stroke, and in neuropsychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia). The significance of the
proposed research is that it will test hypotheses from a novel and potentially paradigm-shifting framework using
innovative and cutting-edge approaches at the level of cognitive large-scale networks and linked to behavior."
10973105,"Positive-sense single-strand RNA viruses [(+)RNA viruses] are responsible for a significant portion of human
infections and represent a high risk for new and emerging human diseases. This group of viruses includes
flaviviruses such as dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and West Nile Virus (WNV), which are collectively
responsible for >400 million human infections each year. Changes in human population distribution and climate
change that drive movement of insect populations that mediate spread of flaviviruses into new environments
increase the risk of widespread infections in naïve populations. This risk is exemplified by the 2016 outbreak of
Zika virus in South America and is enhanced by the current lack of effective vaccines or antivirals. Studies aimed
at determining the mechanisms of virus infection and interactions between viruses and host cells are vital to
understanding and controlling these pathogens.
The objectives of this study are to interrogate the mechanisms by which flaviviruses utilize host protein
networks that facilitate viral replication and to investigate methods to disrupt these processes. All studied
(+)RNA viruses replicate in host membranes with the majority requiring the ER for the formation of their viral
replication organelles (vROs) that have a high level of morphological conservation between distantly related
(+)RNA virus species. Despite widespread infection, relatively little is known about the specific contribution of
host proteins to the formation or structure of (+)RNA virus vROs. Our preliminary experiments have identified
a network of host membrane factors that are critical to DENV and ZIKV replication, likely having a role in the
formation of vROs. In our first aim, we will define the role of these host membrane proteins in the formation
of vROs for two closely related flaviviruses, DENV and ZIKV. To determine if these host proteins are directly
involved in vRO biogenesis, we will employ unique virus expression and infection systems, which allow
precise evaluation of each step in the virus replication cycle, in combination with integrated microscopy and
biochemical approaches. We will also expand our analysis to determine if the identified host factors have
common functions for other (+)RNA viruses. In our second aim, we will use gene manipulation and
mutagenesis to mechanistically interrogate the function of specific host membrane factors in virus replication
and vRO formation.
 This work will significantly advance understanding of the mechanisms underpinning flavivirus
manipulation of ER membranes, furnishing novel insights into fundamental viral processes likely to be
shared by a broad range of (+)RNA viruses."
10807084,"ABSTRACT - PROJECT 1
An effective HCV vaccine to prevent chronic infection will need to induce robust T and B cell responses shortly 
after exposure in the susceptible host, the overall goal of this U19. Project 1 focuses on a structure-guided approach to develop an immunogen that increases the neutralization potency/affinity of elicited 
broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) to conserved epitopes and particularly to those epitopes 
associated with neutralization synergy. It will be an optimized mutant (mt) E1E2 heterodimer that maintains 
native conformational structures for multiple bNAb epitopes to minimize viral escape. The increasing 
information on E2 crystal structures made possible by human monoclonal antibodies (HMAbs) that we 
and others have isolated and characterized as bNAbs, provides a strong foundation for the molecular 
approaches in rational design. A critical and complementary element is the availability of a high-resolution, 
functional map of both bNAb and non-neutralizing epitopes in E2 and E1E2. We have developed a large 
database on immunogenic domains on E2 that is derived from epitope mapping studies with a large panel of 
E2 bNAbs. We have also developed a large panel of bNAbs to E1E2 that will contribute to structural studies on 
E1E2 heterodimer in Project 4. In addition, Project 1 is built on substantial achievements with native 
recombinant wild-type (wt) E1E2 heterodimer as a vaccine against HCV. We have developed the necessary 
production and purification processes and tested to show that our wt E1E2 expresses many bNAbs 
epitopes and that antisera generated from vaccinated mice, guinea pigs, chimpanzees and humans contains 
bNAbs. However, there are gaps in the breadth of protection against some genotypes 2, 3 and 7 HCV isolates. 
Thus, a benchmark is to design a mt E1E2 that elicits antisera more able to neutralize these genotype isolates 
while maintaining a high level of neutralization towards the other genotype isolates achieved with wt E1E2. We 
propose to accomplish this goal by the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Structure-guided modeling to redesign 
E1E2 structures to optimize presentation of E1E2 bNAb epitopes; Aim 2. Expression, purification, and 
characterization of modified/mutant E1E2 heterodimers; and Aim 3. Immunological characterization of 
candidate E1E2 vaccines to select optimized E1E2. Finally, we aim to combine optimized E1E2 with powerful 
adjuvants to enhance neutralizing antibody titers (Project 3). Aim 4 is then the immunological 
characterization of NHP receiving an HCV vaccine optimized for bNAbs and T cell responses"

The goal of Project 3 is to assess in nonhuman primates (NHPs), immunization strategies aimed at 
inducing HCV-specific bnAbs and TRMs in the liver. In particular, we will assess the magnitude and 
durability of bnAb responses induced by immunization with HCV E1/E2 antigens administered with adjuvants; 
and T cell responses induced by sequential immunization with heterologous viral vectors expressing HCV 
NS3-NS5b mosaic antigens. Our recent work has demonstrated the adjuvant capacity of TLR7/8 ligand 3M-052 
to potently stimulate robust and durable nAb responses as well as remarkably long-lived plasma cells 
(LLPCs) in bone marrow, similar to responses observed with live viral vaccines. Therefore, in Aim 1 we will 
evaluate the capacity of 3M-052/alum to stimulate a high magnitude and durability of HCV E1/E2 specific 
bnAb responses. As a comparator, we will use a novel adjuvant, composed of a liposome, a TLR4 agonist 
(monophosphoryl lipid A, MPL) and the saponin called QS-21, (Lipo/ QS-21/ MPL), which was recently shown 
to induce a superior HCV glycoprotein-specific T cell response in mice. 
Aim 1: To determine the capacity of 3M-052/alum and Lipo/QS-21/MPL to adjuvant antigenspecific immune responses to HCV E1/E2. In this aim, we will test the hypothesis that immunization with 
HCV E1/E2 with adjuvant results in robust and sustained nAb responses in NHPs. 
In the case of T cells, our recent results demonstrate that vaccination induced CD8+ TRMs and 
nAb responses can synergize to provide enhanced protection against viral acquisition to mucosal infectioN. 
Using single cell transcriptional profiling we demonstrated that reactivation of TRMs in mucosal tissues 
stimulates anti-viral restriction factors in mucosal myeloid cells, thereby creating a restrictive local environment 
for viral entry. We hypothesize that an HCV vaccine that induces antigen-specific liver TRMs and 
nAbs will confer superior protection against HCV, through a similar mechanism involving local innate 
antiviral responses in myeloid cells and hepatocytes in the liver. 
Aim 2: To characterize the innate and adaptive immune responses induced by sequential 
immunization with heterologous viral vectors expressing HCV NS3-NS5b mosaic antigens, followed by 
immunization with E1/E2 and NS3-5 antigens plus adjuvant. We will immunize NHPs sequentially with 
Ad48 and MVA expressing Mosaic NS3-5, (to induce NS3-5 specific CD8+ T cells), followed by immunization 
with soluble HCV E1/E2 antigens (to induce nAbs), and soluble NS3-5 antigens (to boost the CD8+ T cell 
response primed by viral vectors), administered with an adjuvant. We will analyze the innate and adaptive 
response in three sub-aims."

Despite extensive research efforts to understand the biology of hepatitis C virus (HCV), it remains a major human 
pathogen without a vaccine. In addition, there is a remarkable absence of information regarding the structure of 
the virion and organization of its component proteins. We intend to use our extensive structural biology 
experience with the related flaviviruses, to focus on determining the structure of the viral glycoproteins, the virus 
particle, and complexes of potent neutralizing antibodies bound to the surface glycoproteins. This project will rely 
heavily on and interact extensively with Project 1 to interrogate the structure and provide guidance into the 
features of the glycoproteins that are important for eliciting broad and potent neutralizing antibodies. Iterative 
analysis and re-engineering of the E1E2 glycoproteins will be conducted to guide the antibody component of a 
dual B and T cell HCV vaccine, the focus of this U19 proposal. This specific project will use three aims to 
determine the structure of the E1E2 heterodimer, the virus particle, and neutralizing antibody Fabs bound to the 
glycoproteins. Based on biophysical and immunological assays, computational modeling and structure analyses, 
the E1E2 glycoproteins will be engineered to present epitopes that elicit strong neutralizing and broadly reactive 
antibodies and minimize the presentation of decoy non-productive epitopes. Furthermore, the organization of 
the glycoproteins and the structure of the virus particle will be determined. The tools of molecular virology, 
biophysics, computational modeling, x-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy will be used to produce 
atomic-level details of the epitope landscape of HCV. The gained structural information will be utilized to design 
novel antigens in Project 1, determine the structures of designed immunogens experimentally in Project 4 and 
tested in vivo in Projects 1, 2 and 3. We will guide Project 1 at various times during the project to allow them to 
utilize the optimal E1E2 immunogen for studies in guinea pigs and, ultimately, a lead candidate for an optimized 
E1E2 immunogen for nonhuman primate studies. This information will be invaluable in deciphering the nature of 
neutralizing antibodies and their mechanisms of action against HCV and will shed light on the assembly and 
entry of hepatitis C virions."
10807083,"ABSTRACT – CORE B (NONHUMAN PRIMATE CORE)
After over 3 decades since the discovery of Hepatitis C virus as one cause of hepatitis and cancer in patients, a 
preventive vaccine is still not available. More alarming is the fact that precise correlates of protection remain 
elusive. While passively administered neutralizing antibodies have been able to prevent initiation of infection in 
chimpanzees, the same treatment in the context of established infection just gave rise to mutants no longer 
susceptible to neutralization by this particular Mab and without apparent decrease in replication fitness. 
Conversely, spontaneous resolution of the infection as seen in about 25% of patient appears to primarily rely on 
cell mediated immune responses such as intra-hepatic CTLs. Generating such response via immunization has 
been a steep challenge given the multiple mechanism used by the virus to evade the effector antiviral responses. 
While recent development of antiviral agents have succeeded in the elimination of the majority of treated patients, 
this cure is expensive and patients having cleared infection therapeutically generally do not develop protective 
responses to a reinfection. To make matters worse, subclinical HCV infection not only does not generate 
protective response against superinfection but appears to paralyze many cell mediated effector immune 
functions, via the recruitment of regulatory T cells in the liver. 
Thus, generating potent and lasting protective mechanisms against HCV infection will require novel approaches, 
targeting both humoral and cell mediated antiviral responses, which is the goal of this collaborative program. 
The generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies will be attempted using HCV E1/E2 wild-type and optimized 
scaffolds that will minimize the presentation of non or subtype only neutralizing epitopes while presenting 
conserved epitopes across the 7 HCV genotypes along with potent adjuvants. A second approach will use a 
combination of live attenuated viral vector presenting non structural proteins Mosaic recombinant proteins in 
efforts to generate potent CTLs to HCV. This nonhuman primate Core will allow for testing each approach 
separately and in combination in a host that closely mimic the human immune system and repertoire, allowing 
for optimization of the responses and their analyses ex vivo for efficacy. This will be accomplished in a series of 
studies using the Indian origin macaque model of immunization, which will allow for repeated sampling and 
procurement of blood and bone marrow samples as well as biopsies of draining lymph nodes and liver of the 
entire monitoring period to Projects 2 and 3."

CANDIDATE: I am a postdoctoral research associate in the laboratory of Dr. Gretchen E. Diehl in the
Immunology Program at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. I obtained my PhD working in gut
microbiota and systemic lupus erythematosus under the supervision of Dr. Martin Kriegel. My current research
applies the techniques I learned in my postdoc and graduate school to assess the role of gut microbes in the
thymic development of microbiota-specific T cells and how these T cells can modulate disease in susceptible
hosts. To elucidate this process, I used a tetramer-based approach to identify and track antigen-specific T cells
expansion in the thymus before they distribute and differentiate in the periphery. I plan to study how this
process is altered in autoimmunity. My proposed research and mentoring plan will provide me the required
foundation to transition into an independent researcher with a long-term career goal to understand how
microbiota-specific T cell responses arise and define how they exacerbate lupus pathogenesis. To achieve this
goal, together with my mentoring team, I have developed a career plan that will 1) increase my technical skills,
2) refine my scientific scope, 3) improve my communication skills, and 4) expand my scientific network.
RESEARCH: Lupus development is associated with intestinal dysbiosis in patients and mouse models.
Dysbiosis in lupus is characterized by pathobiont overgrowth and is linked to dysregulated immune responses
that exacerbate pathogenesis. In my graduate work, I found increased pathobionts including Lactobacillus
reuteri in mouse lupus models and subsets of SLE patients. I showed L. reuteri translocated systemically,
leading to increased inflammatory pathways and proinflammatory T cells which exacerbated systemic
inflammation and worsened lupus pathogenesis. In my postdoctoral work, I am investigating how differentiation
of microbiota-specific T cells is regulated during development and its effects in inflammatory processes. While
we and others find peripheral expansion of microbiota-specific T cells with effector function in adult mice, in
young mice we surprisingly found microbiota-specific T cells first expanded in the thymus, a site not previously
known to allow for antigen-specific T cell expansion. I aim to synergize the knowledge generated during my
graduate and postdoctoral training to determine if thymic development of L. reuteri-specific T cells is amplified
in lupus susceptible hosts and to assess their role in lupus exacerbation. I will develop this proposal by 1)
Determining how thymic microbiota-specific T cells modulate lupus pathogenesis and 2) Defining how lupus
pathobionts modulate pathobiont-specific T cells expansion.
ENVIRONMENT: The laboratory is part of the Immunology program at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center, a state-of-the-art research institute. Furthermore, my mentoring committee and collaborators will
provide the required scientific and non-scientific support for the research and career development proposed."
10974072,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Wnt signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that regulates several cellular behaviors such as
cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, and migration to promote tissue homeostasis. Of note, the Wg/Wnt
signaling pathway is important for tissue patterning and is often deregulated in epithelial cancers. Secreted Wnt
ligands are distributed in the extracellular space to promote paracrine and long-range signaling in target cells.
These paracrine and long-range functions of Wnts are dependent on extracellular Wnt availability, which in part
is dictated by cell-surface glypican, Dally-like protein (Dlp). In this proposal, I will focus on molecular mechanisms
that dictate Dlp-mediated regulation of Wnt availability and signaling.
 Dlp’s role in regulating Wnt signaling has been described as ‘biphasic’: By continual binding and release,
Dlp simultaneously promotes long-range signaling and restricts paracrine signaling, ensuring proper ligand
availability at both ranges. The Page-McCaw lab established Drosophila germarium, a tissue where oogenesis
occurs, as a model to study mechanisms that define Wnt signaling ranges, and identified a novel Dlp/Mmp2
(Matrix Metalloprotease 2) module that modulates paracrine and long-range Wnt signaling in the germarium.
Specifically, I found that proteolytic cleavage of Dlp by Mmp2 alters its subcellular localization and function to
modulate Wnt availability. Additionally, my preliminary data suggest that Dlp/Mmp2 may regulate Wnt signaling
in epithelial tumors to promote tumor growth. In Aim 1, I will investigate the molecular events that occur
downstream of proteolytic cleavage of Dlp to modulate Wg/Wnt availability and signaling in the germarium and
tumors.
 The extracellular Wnt distribution is tightly linked with its production and secretion. I found that Dlp can
modulate Wg (Wnt-1) production in source cells in the germarium. Wg production in source cells in germaria is
tightly regulated and this regulation is crucial for proper oogenesis. Additionally, I found that Dlp interacts with
non-ligand proteins (a finding that has not been previously reported) that communicate with intracellular
cytoskeletal machinery, potentially to modulate cell adhesion and/or shape. In Aim 2, I will investigate novel
mechanisms of how Dlp regulates Wnt ligand production and long-range Wg distribution to facilitate long-range
Wg signaling. These investigations will uncover previously unappreciated roles of cell-surface glypicans in
regulating Wnt signaling and elucidate novel paradigms of developmental strategies employed in multicellular
organisms to maintain tissue homeostasis."
10949543,"Cannabis use among pregnant people is on the rise. This trend is likely to be continue, especially among
people who are younger or those live in states where cannabis is legal. Yet, pregnant people may not be
aware of the potential risks. Prenatal exposure to cannabis has been consistently linked to low birth weight.
Our pilot data further suggests that prenatal exposure to cannabis is associated with rapid growth in the first
three years of life followed by increased adiposity and glucose at age 5 years. However, important gaps in
knowledge remain. It is unclear whether a particular cannabinoid may be driving this association, as
epidemiologic studies have examined the independent or joint effects of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-
THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Additionally, there is a need to identify protective factors that mitigate risk, given
that this exposure may have occurred in the past. Furthermore, it is unknown whether there are developmental
windows in which the offspring may be more susceptible to these cannabinoids. In response to NOT-DA-22-
003, our overarching goal is to determine when and how prenatal exposure to cannabis impacts childhood
adiposity and cardiometabolic health. These specific health traits are relevant to adult health as they track
across the lifespan and have been previously collected in our rich Colorado-based cohort (Healthy Start;
R01DK076648). Pregnant people were recruited between 2010 and 2014, amid state-wide legalization of
cannabis for recreational use but prior to widespread health messaging about the potential harm to the fetus.
We propose to measure Δ9-THC and CBD in maternal serum (collected at ~17 and ~27 weeks gestation) and
in umbilical cord blood. Our central hypothesis is that prenatal exposure to cannabis will be associated with
increased adiposity and altered cardiometabolic traits at age 5 years. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that
the associations between Δ9-THC/CBD and child health will be stronger among those with co-exposure to
tobacco and mitigated by a longer duration of breastfeeding and higher intakes of key nutrients. In Aim 2, we
will examine windows of susceptibility in which prenatal exposure to Δ9-THC and/or CBD influences growth
and cardiometabolic health among the 5-year-old offspring. we will identify windows of heightened
susceptibility. This exploratory study includes a well-characterized, observational cohort with a relatively high
prevalence of exposure (13% at mid-gestation) and a novel on cardiometabolic outcomes, making it uniquely
positioned to advance our understanding of when and how prenatal exposure to cannabis influences child
health. Results may inform future targeted interventions to limit the effects of exposure during pregnancy."

Hybrid healthcare delivery is an integral part of the new healthcare landscape, connecting patients and clinicians
using a combination of in-person and telehealth modalities. Hybrid models transform traditional chronic disease
management, which is episodic, reactive, and expensive, to an approach that is adaptive, preventative, and
efficient. As such, they stand to have a significant impact on the care of 133 million US adults (roughly 1 in 2)
with at least one chronic illness. Unfortunately, the adoption, sustainability, and scalability of hybrid models in
chronic disease are threatened by the inability to monitor disease activity and progression during telehealth visits.
Such is the case in interstitial lung disease (ILD), a group of complex, chronic pulmonary diseases with
unpredictable disease courses. Fortunately, remote patient monitoring (RPM) is a feasible, acceptable, and
accurate approach to monitoring chronic disease activity and progression. In ILD clinical trials, remote spirometry
and oximetry can reliably monitor lung function and blood oxygen levels and predict disease progression and
clinic-based assessments. However, in the US, RPM has yet to be adopted into routine ILD practice. The
objective of this application is to bridge this gap by determining how to make RPM data accessible and actionable
in ILD hybrid care models. We propose to leverage the computational power of artificial intelligence to provide
RPM-informed clinical decision support (CDS) at the point of care. The specific aims are to: (1) identify provider
and health-system level barriers to an RPM-informed CDS tool, (2) evaluate the performance of ILD-risk
classification algorithms using RPM data (3) assess the implementation and effectiveness potential of an RPM-
informed CDS tool designed to identify patients at high risk for accelerated progression. The lessons learned in
ILD are likely to be generalizable to other chronic disease models, amplifying the impact of this research.
These aims will be achieved using implementation science, mixed methods, cognitive informatics, and
interventional study design and they address the NHLBI research priority areas to leverage emerging
opportunities in data science and to optimize implementation research. The studies are novel in their
application of complimentary methodologies to develop point-of-care CDS in ILD, with an eye towards broad
dissemination. The proposed studies are informed by Dr. Farrand’s expertise as an ILD physician and supported
by her research program which leverages digital health tools and implementation science methodologies to
improve the delivery of high-quality, safe, and effective care in chronic lung diseases. During this award, Dr.
Farrand will undertake training in four areas: 1) applying implementation science frameworks to design,
implement, and evaluate interventions, 2) conducting qualitative and mixed methods research, 3) applying
cognitive informatics to design and integrate artificial intelligence into clinical practice, and 4) designing
interventional studies. Dr. Farrand has assembled a mentorship team with content, methodologic, and practical
expertise to ensure completion of the proposed research and training and successful transition to independence."

of tissues, can similarly prime the pancreas to promote or prevent tumor development. The two aims in our
proposal investigate effects of two HFDs chosen specifically because they are enriched for classes of fatty acids
known to have distinct biological effects. Aim 1 examines the effects of a HFD comprised of lard (HFLD), which
contains mostly saturated long chain fatty acids that are associated with obesity, on PDA tumorigenesis. To
study how HFLD may prime the pancreas for tumor growth, we will use scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq to define
dietary effects on healthy pancreas. We will also leverage our newly developed CYTO-Tag mouse to rapidly
isolate acinar cells for metabolomics, thus allowing us to draw connections between changes in gene expression,
chromatin structure, and metabolism in acinar cells in the context of HFLD. We will then use a tamoxifen-
inducible Ptf1a-CreERT/LSL-KrasG12D (iKC) model to study the effects of HFLD on tumor growth, and use an
orthotopic tumor model generated from HFLD-conditioned iKC acinar cells to distinguish between acinar cell-
intrinsic and -extrinsic tumor growth mechanisms. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of a HFD comprised of
coconut oil (HFCD), isocalorically matched with the HFLD, on PDA tumor growth. Coconut oil is comprised of
medium chain saturated fatty acids. It is a common dietary fat “swap” patients use when attempting to eat
healthier, particularly in a ketogenic diet, but the effects of HFCD on PDA tumor growth are not known. We will
use scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, and our CYTO-Tag mouse to characterize the effects of HFCD on healthy
pancreas, followed by tumor growth experiments in iKC mice. We will begin to pinpoint mechanisms underlying
any observed effects on tumor growth through studies in orthotopic tumor models using HFCD-conditioned
acinar cells. Aim 2 will define the effects of HFCD on tumor growth for the first time, and because our HFLD and
HFCD are isocaloric, we will be able to directly compare effects of these diets on tumor growth. Understanding
the molecular basis underlying differential effects of compositionally distinct HFD will enable more informed
dietary recommendations for patients to potentially reduce cancer risk."

The purpose of this research project is to provide research and career development training for Ms.
Kiari R. Kinnie, a doctoral student in Nursing at University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). This
administrative supplement, in response to PA-23-189: “Research Supplements to Promote Diversity
in Health-Related Research”, will expand the RO1 funded parent project titled, “Epigenomic and
Gene Expression Signatures of Chronic Low Back Pain (Aroke, PI). This supplement will support the
final year of pre-doctoral education, training, research, and mentorship of an outstanding student who
has obtained significant strides despite poverty and other significant adversities. Ms. Kinnie is a
registered nurse with significant desire to cultivate research to mitigate pain disparities of
disadvantaged populations. The primary aim of this research project is to determine the extent in
which epigenetic modification’s influences the relationship between resilience and chronic low back
pain (chronic LBP). Thus, we will examine how epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation
and cortisol levels: 1) differ between individuals with high and low resilience and 2) how these levels
predict chronic low back pain outcomes, such as functioning, disability, and pain severity, 3) differ
between Black and white individuals. The career development component of this supplement will
afford Ms. Kinnie with opportunities to acquire specific specialized research and educational training
in Epigenetics, disseminate research at national and international conferences, and access multiple
levels of mentorship. This administrative supplement will allow Ms. Kinnie an equal opportunity to
become a successful independent researcher. This project will be overseen by primary mentor, Dr.
Edwin Aroke, a minority researcher with clinical and research expertise in nursing, chronic pain, and
epigenetic research. This expertise in combination, with Ms. Kinnie’s determination and passion for
innovative nursing research, will provide Ms. Kinnie with the excellent foundation to pursue her own
program of research."
10974796,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Single-cell sequencing circumvents the averaging artifacts associated with traditional bulk population data and
has seen rapid technological developments over the past few years. This offers new opportunities to study
genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic heterogeneity at the cellular level without cell type confounding, but it
also requires novel analytical approaches. One major challenge in such genomic studies is the lack of rigorous
methods for integrating bulk-tissue and single-cell sequencing data and for aligning multi-modal single-cell omics
data. The research program of my lab centers around developing statistical/computational methods and
bioinformatics tools to better utilize and analyze different types of next-generation sequencing data, with a special
focus on detecting structural variants, deciphering genomic and transcriptomic heterogeneity, and assessing
cellular heterogeneity by single-cell omics approaches. Our long-term vision is to introduce problems arising
from new biomedical data to the statistics community and to provide data-driven statistical methods and open-
source tools to biomedical researchers for better data analysis and experimental design. Specifically, in the next
five years, our proposed program of research will focus on the following interconnected objectives: (i) bulk omics
deconvolution aided by single-cell sequencing, followed by association testing with clinical variables; (ii) joint
modeling of bulk genomic sequencing and single-cell transcriptomic sequencing data to simultaneously infer
DNA and RNA variation at the single-cell level; and (iii) multi-modal alignment of single-cell omics data. During
this period, we will keep collaborating with experimental labs, applying our developed methods to interrogate
cellular heterogeneity under both biological and clinical settings. We will provide our methods as freely available
and open-source R packages, which will include extensive tutorials and workflows that are accessible and useful
to the biomedical research community."
10974807,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a syndrome of new hypertension (HTN) with organ damage that occurs in
3-8% of pregnancies and is a leading cause of maternal mortality. Women who survive PE have
a substantially increased risk of future HTN, heart attack and stroke by unknown mechanisms.
These women have enhanced blood pressure and vasoconstriction responses to HTN stress that
persists months to years after PE. In male mice, T cells are necessary for hypertension and
effector memory T cells contribute to exacerbated responses to repetitive hypertensive stresses.
To explore mechanisms driving post-PE HTN, we modified two models of PE; one is induced by
overexpression of the anti-angiogenic soluble VEGF receptor 1 (sFlt1) during pregnancy and the
other is induced by hypoxia during pregnancy. I confirmed that both models cause increased sFlt1
and other features of PE seen in humans. Preliminary data in the sFlt1 model reveals that despite
post-partum sFlt1 levels and blood pressure normalizing: (1) post-partum microvascular
structure/function abnormalities persist; (2) post-partum HTN stimuli results in an exacerbated
blood pressure response, microvascular vasoconstriction and microvascular expression of the T-
cell chemokine, CCL5; and (3) kidney effector memory T cells are significantly increased after
HTN stimuli. Thus, I propose to test the hypothesis that experimental PE causes long-term T cell-
mediated changes in the microvasculature and kidney that increase sensitivity to post-partum
HTN stimuli. Aim 1 will examine if T cells are necessary for persistent vascular remodeling and
dysfunction after PE. T cell populations, migration and cytokine expression will be measured
during and after PE and in response to hypertensive stimuli. T cells will then be depleted and
blood pressure and vascular structure/function analyzed. Aim 2 will determine if adoptive transfer
of T cells exposed to PE is sufficient to induce the vascular and kidney changes associated with
post-PE HTN. Aim 3 will test the specific role of memory T cells in exacerbating the response to
hypertensive stimuli after PE. Completion of the aims will provide new insight into the mechanism
driving the substantial increase in HTN risk after PE, thereby supporting the NIH mission to
improve maternal health. The proposal will also allow me to gain new expertise in HTN diseases
of pregnancy and foundational immunology techniques. The mentoring team assembled on this
application, with expertise in cardiovascular immunology, nephrology, pregnancy and vascular
biology, the environment at Tufts Medical Center and Tufts University and the training plan
proposed will further strengthen my ability to become an independent investigator studying
mechanisms driving heart diseases in women."

10954581,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Each year, nearly 2 million Americans receive a cancer diagnosis, with surgical removal being the primary
treatment approach for solid tumors. Nowhere are the challenges and benefits of high precision surgery more
apparent than in the brain where maximal resection is the primary therapeutic approach and where healthy tissue
must be preserved. For glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), one of the deadliest and treatment-resistant
malignancies, the extent of surgical resection provides the best indication of overall survival which is why
establishing maximum safe boundaries is a fundamental neuro-surgical objective. Despite two decades of
relentless improvements in surgical techniques, the median survival for GBM remains at 16 months using best-
practice radiosurgery with temozolomide. Advancements in diagnostic and imaging capabilities must be matched
by surgical practices to be effective. Consequently, as imaging modalities such as MRI, CT, or ultrasound have
improved in resolution, sensitivity, and specificity, so has the precision of surgical tools, such robotic surgery
systems or navigation systems, and minimally or non-invasive methods such as laparoscopies, radio-frequency
ablation, radiosurgery, and high intensity focused ultrasound. However, these methods struggle to achieve a
resolution beyond 2 mm, which is a significant hurdle when precision is crucial for the resection of complex
tumors near critical structures.
In this application, UNC-Chapel Hill and Caltech will collaborate to develop non-invasive transcranial volumetric
super-resolution imaging, targeted contrast agents, and image-guided focused ultrasound surgery. Our proposal
focuses on combining these techniques to resolve the persistent challenges of a) identifying tumor boundaries
b) targeting them with ultrasound, and c) establishing interaction between imaging and therapy systems to avoid
and/or target critical microvasculature. Advancements in imaging resolution (10 µm) will be matched by the co-
registered focused ultrasound beams (750 µm diameter, 50 µm positional accuracy). New ultrasound array
designs combined with super-harmonic sequences will enable the targeting of GV contrast agents as well as
freely circulating microbubble contrast agents that quantitatively image the intra- and extra-tumoral microvascular
environment. A programmable ultrasound scanner platform will control both the proposed therapy array and a
3D imaging array which will allow high-precision volumetric targeting and monitoring as well as enabling
sophisticated feedback between thermoablation and its effect on tumor microvasculature. If successful, this
project will thus enable effective surgical interventions in the highest mortality tumors."
10954146,"Project Summary/Abstract:
There is a compelling need to develop treatments for mental deficiencies from fetal exposure to alcohol. The
impairments are often lifelong and while early intervention services may help reduce some of the effects of
alcohol exposure, there are no cures or adequate specific medical treatments for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum
Disorders (FASD) presently available. Results from studies in humans and animal models suggest that a
disruption in neuronal plasticity is the underlying mechanism responsible for the cognitive impairments caused
by fetal alcohol exposure. Vinpocetine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, has been shown in multiple animal
studies, including multiple models of FASD, to improve neuronal plasticity. Therefore, we hypothesize that
vinpocetine may ameliorate the deficits observed in this condition. However, we recently found that the doses
of vinpocetine that are commonly used in humans produce blood levels that are much lower than effective
levels in animal models. Thus, higher doses in humans are needed to produce levels that match effective
levels in animals. Further, dose-response curves are not available from the prior animal studies. Therefore, in
the R61, specific aim 1 is designed to characterize the dose/plasma concentrations response curve for
vinpocetine effects in several FASD animal models. Although vinpocetine is well tolerated in humans at doses
that are typically used, the tolerability of the higher doses is not known. Specific aim 2 in the R61 will determine
the maximum tolerated oral dose of vinpocetine in healthy adult volunteers and develop pilot data on
pharmacokinetic time curve for vinpocetine effects. The data gathered in the proposed series of animal studies
and the Phase I healthy human dose escalation study in the R61 portion will guide specific aim 3, which will
establish a multicenter research team, develop tools for data management and research oversight, develop the
experimental research design, refine a protocol including dosages for the subsequent Phase I and Phase II
studies in the R33, and prepare an operations and procedures manual for the FASD human studies. In the
R33, we propose Phase I and Phase II studies to assess safety and potential cognitive efficacy of doses of
vinpocetine (guided by the findings of the R61 studies) in treating adolescents and adults with FASD.
Therefore, specific aim 4 will assess the safety of doses of vinpocetine in adolescents, while specific aim 5 will
assess the efficacy and safety of vinpocetine to enhance cognition in adolescents and adults with FASD in a
Phase II study. The Phase II study will provide data to determine optimal dose, effect sizes, and best
neuropsychological assessment to be used as the main outcome for a future Phase III trial."

Suicidal ideation (SI) is prevalent and impairing in youth and can lead to restrictive and
intensive care. There is a critical need to develop and test scalable brief interventions
conducive to enhancing least-restrictive, cost-efficient, and accessible support, and which
target drivers of SI in youth. This R61/R33 application addresses this need via a brief
intervention module for youth experiencing subacute SI (i.e., SI which does not necessitate
intensive, restrictive services) which targets an established driver of SI, perceived
burdensomeness toward others (PB). This R61/R33 proposal builds on pilot findings by first
demonstrating the ability of the brief module to engage the target now in a rigorous
randomized controlled trial (RCT; R61) and then evaluating the module embedded within a
larger CBT protocol in preparation for a larger clinical trial (R33). We will measure the target
using established and novel measures recently developed and validated by the MPIs with an
eye toward establishing multimethod measurement of PB for a possible larger clinical trial.
The proposed intervention module addresses current empirical and clinical gaps in the
following ways: The intervention module (1) precisely targets a suicide-related interpersonal
risk factor, leveraging the MPIs recent clinical trial findings and in congruence with a large
body of work on suicide etiology and theory; (2) is easily combined with standard therapies via
simplicity from a streamlined manual and intuitive concepts, (3) and is highly scalable via a
cognitive-behavioral approach with high resource efficiency (e.g., minimal therapist training,
little session time needed). The study is therefore congruent with NIMH Strategy 3.2.A:
“Developing multi-modal intervention strategies that combine the simultaneous application of
established or novel [psychosocial interventions] to selectively access specific therapeutic
targets.”"
10954155,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The incidence of hematological malignancies is higher in persons living with PLWH (Persons living with HIV
(Human Immunodeficiency Virus)). The risk of developing classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) in PLWH is 5-26
times the general population. The US (United States) HIV/AIDS Cancer Match study documented a 1.63-fold
increase in the incidence of CHL in PLWH after the introduction of ART compared to the pre-ART era.
CHL is an unusual B-cell malignancy with <5% tumor cells amidst >95% benign cells composed of immune
and stromal cells. Most are of the mixed cellularity histological subtype of CHL, and 80-100% of CHL in PLWH
are EBV-associated. Our previous study, using a limited panel of antibodies, showed that the immune
microenvironment of CHL in PLWH differs from those seen in immunocompetent patients. Furthermore, the
immune microenvironment plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of CHL. DNA from leukocytes in untreated
HIV-infected individuals show DNA methylation changes indicative of aging. Combination ART can partly
reverse epigenetic aging but does not entirely correct it.
We hypothesize that the persistent epigenetic alterations within the immune cells in PLWH on long-
term combination ART result in altered and aberrant gene expression in the immune cells. In the
context of the presence of sufficient numbers of CD4+ T cells, the abnormal immune cells contribute to
the pathogenesis of classic Hodgkin lymphoma; they are responsible for the increased relative risk of
developing CHL in PLWH on combination ART.
We propose to identify persistent transcriptomic changes in immune cells in benign lymph nodes of PLWH on
combination ART and address whether these or related changes can be documented in CHL samples of
PLWH. We will select benign/reactive lymph nodes from 21 PLWH on ART and 21 age-matched non-PLWH
groups, and CHL samples from 26 PLWH and 26 age-matched and EBV-association matched non-PLWH
individuals. We will include paired benign lymph node and CHL samples from the same patients in the study.
RNA extracted from the samples will be evaluated by Bulk RNA Barcoding and Sequencing (BRB-seq) and by
Nanostring nCounter analysis. For nCounter analysis, we will use a panel ~100 genes representative of
immune response to hematolymphoid tumors, to identify differentially expressed RNAs and to validate the
results of BRB-Seq. Tissue microarrays will be prepared from the paraffin blocks, and spatial transcriptomics
and protein expression will be undertaken using the CosMXTM Spatial Molecular Image analysis system to
evaluate the tissue microenvironment in a single-cell and spatial context. The differential RNA expression not
addressed by CosMXTM will be addressed by multiplex-immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization
(RNAscope). The innovative BRB-seq that we propose to validate will significantly reduce the costs of RNA
sequencing and expression analysis."
10973903,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Asthma remains a significant healthcare burden for children and has a long-term impact on their
development and health. Inhaled corticosteroids are key for managing asthmatic symptoms and disease
progression. However, children with severe asthma are insensitive or resistant corticosteroid therapies, leading
to the need for systemic use at high doses. Airway smooth muscle (ASM) is a key structural cell that regulates
airway function and tone. In severe pediatric asthma, airway inflammation, hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and
remodeling continues despite aggressive corticosteroid treatments. Yet the underlying biological mechanisms of
corticosteroid insensitivity or resistance, particularly in ASM, remain undefined. Studies have reported
associations between Th1 inflammation, as indicated by increased Th1 lymphocyte airway infiltration and IFNγ
levels, and severe asthma. Additionally, we recently showed that combined exposure to IFNγ and TNFα uniquely
induces corticosteroid resistance in ASM. These data have led us to hypothesize that IFNγ and TNFα interactions
enable pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, notably NFκB and JAK/Stat1, to remain activated in the presence
of corticosteroids. Via 2 Specific Aims, we will use novel mouse and human models of corticosteroid resistance
to examine airway inflammation, hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and remodeling in ASM. Specific Aim 1 will test
the hypothesis that IFNγ enhances airway hyperresponsiveness and remodeling in ASM during steroid resistant
allergic airway inflammation. While Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that combined exposure to IFNγ and
TNFα opens chromatin structure, leading to corticosteroid resistance in human pediatric ASM. This proposal will
involve using cellular, molecular, and bioinformatic approaches to understand how interactions between IFNγ
and TNFα enhance Ca2+ regulatory mechanisms and transcriptional regulation in ASM. Furthermore, we will
examine whether targeting the JAK/Stat pathway can improve corticosteroid sensitivity in ASM and improve
airway function. These novel studies will expand the current understanding of how airway structural cells, such
as ASM, develop corticosteroid resistance while also beginning to define mechanisms that mediate corticosteroid
resistance in severe pediatric asthma."

therapeutic hypotheses. The TEPs will consist of: gene knockout reagents and cell lines; purified target
proteins for functional studies and for the development of antibodies and inhibitors; and structures of proteins
and protein:ligand complexes, to understand protein functions and support drug development. Target selection
and the definition of the required experimental tools will be determined in consultation with the Bioinformatics

 4. Generate high-resolution structures of the proteins with small molecules bound."
10954115,"PROJECT SUMMARY ASSAY CORE
The Emory-Sage-SGC-Jax TREAT-AD Assay Development and Screen Core (Assay Core) serves as a
technology platform to provide innovative and informative assays for target assessment, for high throughput
screening of challenging targets and evaluation of biological perturbagens, and for functional characterization
of biological and chemical probes in in vitro and in vivo models. The Assay Core has established an innovative
operational structure that harnesses a wide range of expertise and capabilities for AD target evaluation and
chemical and biological probe discovery from both public and private sectors. The Core will be organized with
an operational hub at Emory University and spokes of expanded capabilities with world-leading Associated
Partners, who will contribute specialized assays, screens, and biological expertise. Associated Partners
include the University of Pittsburgh with AD animal models for in vivo target engagement and efficacy studies,
the University of California San Francisco for expertise in CRISPR-based functional genomics in human iPSC-
derived neural cells, the Jackson Laboratory for bioinformatics and data analysis, the University of Washington
for in-depth target biology, and the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC) for rich experience in diverse
assays and screens. With our demonstrated capabilities and combined complementary expertise and
integrated operation with Bioinformatics, Structural Biology, Med Chem, and Admin and Data Cores, we
will support the overarching goal of TREAT-AD by developing hypothesis-driven and informative assays,
creating experimental reagents, and validating probes to populate Target Enabling Packages (TEPs) for each
prioritized target to catalyze robust evaluation of a diverse set of therapeutic hypotheses. The Assay Core aims
(i) to provide experimental assay evidence in AD-relevant cell systems to advance nominated targets through a
tiered pipeline to enable target identification and prioritization, (ii) to evaluate validated tools/probes that enable
modulation of targets, (iii) to support studies of the disease-modifying role of identified biological or chemical
probes in AD pathogenesis for target prosecution and biological insights. Over the 5-year project, completion of
these aims will generate experimental evidence for up to 100 nominated targets (~10-20 per year) for
development of assay packages and will test a minimum of 5 target-specific probes per year. For each target,
all reagents and tools will be released as TEPs to the scientific community."
10954116,"PROJECT SUMMARY MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY CORE
The Emory-Sage-SGC-Jax TREAT-AD Center Medicinal Chemistry (MedChem) Core, led by Dr. Alison
Axtman, aims to contribute a key component of Target Enabling Packages (TEPs): a small molecule. At
minimum, this small molecule will represent a chemical starting point, validated to bind to its target, in need of
further optimization in terms of on-target potency and proteome-wide selectivity. Ideally, this small molecule will
prove suitable for optimization by the MedChem Core into a chemical probe that can be shared with the
scientific community to interrogate and vet poorly characterized AD protein targets. The track record of the
Axtman lab, which is part of the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC), supports that delivery of chemical
probes is both feasible and routinely executed for a variety of targets.
Purified protein and assays developed by the Structural Biology Core (StrucBio Core) will enable the
MedChem Core to engage in hit discovery, specifically employing DNA-encoded library screening with
machine learning (DEL/ML) as part of novel public-private partnerships with XChem and other partners (Open
DEL/ML, Aim 1). As part of a unique approach, Open DEL/ML will deposit previously proprietary DEL
screening data into the public domain in an ML-enabling format, enabling the community to build models of “hit
space” and to use the models to predict commercially-available drug-like hits. Access to purified protein and
assays will also facilitate characterization of putative hit compounds within the MedChem Core. The
physicochemical properties of these small molecules will be assessed in tandem (Aim 2). Finally, if a confirmed
hit has physicochemical properties to support its optimization, the MedChem Core will iteratively design sets of
drug-like analogs and evaluate them using a hierarchy of embedded assays to probe target affinity, selectivity,
cellular activity, and in vitro ADME properties. Chemical probes that achieve the desired activity in these
assays will advance into in vivo assessment of plasma/brain PK and target engagement, and will be
considered for advancement to models of AD. Compounds that proceed to hit to probe optimization are likely
amongst the best available for a given protein target and thus would be great candidates for inclusion in the AD
Informer Set (Aim 3).

1. Quantify a comprehensive set of neurovascular and behavioral responses to established human
migraine triggers and cortical spreading depression (CSD) using the microchip/video platform.
2. Use the microchip/video platform to characterize the effects of acute migraine therapies on the
response to established migraine triggers and CSD to validate the platform as a useful tool for the
discovery and characterization of acute therapies
3. Use the microchip /video platform to characterize the effects of migraine preventive therapies.
Key findings will be independently replicated at two different institutions.
The platform described in this proposal represents a significant advance in our efforts to find new approaches
to the treatment of migraine, a highly prevalent and disabling nervous system disorder."

Our goal is to develop and assess the clinical potential of quantitative imaging biomarkers of masticatory
myofascial pain syndrome (MMPS). MMPS afflicts nearly 10% of Americans. Many treatments have been
proposed. However, the lack of a reliable non-invasive tool for evaluating changes in myofiber microstructure
has been a major hindrance in assessing existing treatment methods and developing new therapies for
myofascial pain.
 We have recently developed methods to measure and analyze Diffusion Tensor MR Imaging (DTI) data
with varying diffusion times, DTI(t): from the time-dependent diffusion signal transverse to fibers, we extract
anatomical maps of myofiber diameter and sarcolemma permeability to water molecules, and from the time-
dependent diffusion signal along the myofibers, our preliminary results reveal sensitivity to the sarcomere
length. This innovative non-invasive quantitative approach, referred to as the random permeable barrier model
(RPBM), is based on effective medium theory, and has been validated using Monte Carlo simulations and
animal models, as well as tested in human skeletal muscle studies.
 The proposed biomarkers are the RPBM parameters for myofiber diameter, sarcolemma permeability and
sarcomere length scale. These biomarkers are highly favorable biophysical parameters of interest to study
myofiber integrity in myofascial pain syndrome (MPS): Indeed, sarcomeres have been shown to be abnormally
contracted/shortened and myofibers enlarged in myofascial trigger points observed in MPS. Treatments of
MPS including botulinum toxin A treatment may lead to reduction of myofiber diameter. Furthermore, study of
the entire muscle rather than local biopsy is needed to understand the initiation of myofascial trigger points,
which may occur when exceeding a given threshold in case of muscle overuse, trauma or psychological stress.
 In the R61 phase, we will develop and optimize the RPBM method to measure myofiber changes
associated with MMPS, with the following three aims: in Aim 1 we will establish an optimal 15-minute long MRI
protocol and processing pipeline to robustly estimate RPBM parameters. Aim2 is to establish an optimal MRI
protocol that includes the optimized 15-min DTI(t) and a 15-min protocol for conventional quantitative MRI
measures including T1, T2, and fat fraction, and evaluate their repeatability and reproducibility. Aim 3 is to
assess the diagnostic performance of the RPBM parameters.
 In the R33 phase with a clinical trial, we will determine the RPBM parameters and their combinations that
best assess and predict treatment response in MMPS. Once completed, the same RPBM method can be
directly applied to assessing other musculoskeletal areas, such as the shoulder, the upper/lower back and the
pelvis."

Fuchs Endothelial Cornel Dystrophy (FECD), a common age-related dystrophy, which is more prevalent in
women and smokers, is of unknown etiology. In FECD, corneal endothelial (CE) cell loss is accompanied by
abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition in the form of guttae. Our laboratory was the first to link
oxidative DNA damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in FECD pathogenesis. Specifically, we have shown that
ultraviolet-A (UVA) light, by triggering estrogen oxidizing enzyme, CYP1B1, induced greatest FECD phenotype
in female and estrogen-treated male mice due to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage. Estrogen and UVA
induced ATM-driven G2/M cell cycle arrest; however, deficient DNA repair system, led to net DNA damage
resulting in senescent and endothelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes seen in FECD. Still, a
unifying mechanism of how UVA and smoking induce greater FECD phenotype with guttae formation in aging
females is unknown. Building upon our previous findings, we propose to investigate if UVA, age, and smoking–
induced oxidant-antioxidant imbalance leads to polyploidy and fibrosis by causing cell cycle arrest-driven ECM
deposition; and if this imbalance causes activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), the upstream inducer of
CYP1B1, which leads to melatonin breakdown to N-acetylserotonin (increased NAS/melatonin ratio) and
estrogen oxidation affecting mitochondrial DNA repair and biogenesis resulting in senescence seen in FECD.
Our study is significant, as understanding the effect of environmental stressors on sex-dependent mechanisms
involved in CE cell loss will provide new treatment targets for FECD. To achieve these aims, we will use our
newly developed non-genetic mouse model of FECD along with immortalized human CE cell lines, aqueous
humor, and ex vivo specimens of genotyped FECD donors. Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Determine whether
UVA, age, and smoking lead to cell cycle-dependent polyploidization and subsequent senescence that results
in profibrotic phenotype in FECD. This aim is based on the hypothesis that G2/M phase arrest leads to
polyploidization of CE, which protects from acute injury, but with prolonged stress promotes senescence and
fibrosis seen in guttae formation. Aim 2: Determine whether AhR and CYP1B1 activation, from UVA and
smoking, increase NAS/melatonin ratio causing greater DNA damage and CE cell loss in females. This aim is
based on the hypothesis that co-stimulatory effect of estrogen on AhR activates the CYP-family of enzymes
that cause greater estrogen and melatonin metabolism in females in FECD. Aim 3: Determine the role of
mitochondrial melatonin metabolism on DNA repair and mitochondrial biogenesis during the cell cycle arrest.
This aim is based on the hypothesis that mitochondrial translocation of CYP1B1 increases NAS/melatonin ratio
and leads to cell cycle-dependent DNA repair deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction in FECD and aging."

Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) are a broad category of congenital neurological disease characterized by
a wide range of cognitive and behavioral impairments. The etiology of NDD remains elusive, with genetic and
epigenetic factors playing crucial roles in its pathogenesis. Recent advances in genomics have provided valuable
insights into the role of dynamic chromatin reorganization in neurodevelopment and neurodevelopmental
disorders. One key protein involved in chromatin organization is CTCF, which is known for its pivotal role in
regulating gene expression by facilitating long-range chromatin interactions and global chromatin organization,
and was recently identified as the causative gene for a rare NDD referred to as CTCF-related disorder (CRD).
However, the precise mechanisms by which CTCF contributes to neural differentiation-dependent chromatin
organization and NDD pathogenesis are poorly understood. The central aim of this project is to elucidate the
function of CTCF in chromatin organization and transcriptional dynamics during neural differentiation by studying
the molecular and cellular consequence of two CRD-associated CTCF mutations in human pluripotent stem cells
(hPSCs), hPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs), and NPC-derived neural organoids. Preliminary data
indicate that CTCF is a critical regulator of the dynamic transcriptional changes that occur during neural
differentiation. Our research will employ a multi-pronged approach, utilizing both 2D and 3D models of human
neural differentiation. We will use state-of-the-art chromatin conformation capture techniques such as Hi-ChIP
and lamina-associated domain (LAD) mapping to examine the role of CTCF in shaping neural differentiation-
dependent long-range chromatin interactions and nuclear architecture. Moreover, we will utilize neural organoids
to investigate the impact of CTCF mutations on neuronal differentiation, maturation, and function. The outcomes
of this research have significant implications for our understanding of CRD pathogenesis. By uncovering the role
of CTCF in neural differentiation-dependent chromatin organization, we hope to identify potential mechanisms
that contribute to the development of CRD and other neurodevelopmental disorders that stem from dysfunctional
chromatin regulation. In summary, this pilot project grant application seeks funding to investigate the role of
CTCF in neural differentiation and neurodevelopment. Through an integrated approach combining genomics,
epigenomics, and functional analyses, this research aims to shed light on the intricate molecular mechanism
underlying CRD and ultimately contribute to the development of targeted therapies and diagnostic tools for this
complex neurodevelopmental disorder."
10954053,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While there have been tremendous advances in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast
cancer, late-stage ER+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC) has very poor prognosis. The chief reason for this is
tumor endocrine resistance, wherein tumors do not respond to ER-targeting therapies. Endocrine resistance is
the major reason for breast cancer mortality, and a primary challenge in the treatment of ER+ MBC. The most
well known mechanism of endocrine resistance is hotspot activating mutations in ER that lead to ligand
independence. These hotspot mutations are effectively inhibited by the newest class of endocrine therapy,
novel oral selective ER degraders (SERDs), and serve as a biomarker for SERD responsive tumors.
We found a novel non-hotspot ER variant of unknown significance, and double hotspot mutations (in cis, on the
same ER molecule) from clinical whole-exome sequencing of tumors with acquired resistance to ER inhibition.
These single and double mutations are frequent, with the latter present in ~5% of resistant tumors. Without
preclinical characterization, these variants represent an unknown entity in terms of biology and therapy
response. In pilot studies, we found they confer strong resistance to select ER and CDK4/6-targeting therapies,
and that structure modeling suggests they are predicted to alter ER binding to its ligand, inhibitors, and/or
transcriptional co-factors. Robust preclinical studies in well-established models of breast cancer are required
before these findings can be translated to the clinic.
In this application, we propose comprehensive preclinical characterization of these prevalent novel ER variants
through two specific aims: 1) assess oncogenic potential and downstream signaling by novel ER variants,
specifically to determine how they dysregulate downstream ER transactivation, through transcriptomic,
epigenomic, and proteomic profiling, reporter assays, and structure modeling, and 2) profile their response to
targeted therapies in cell line, patient-derived organoid, and animal xenograft models. At the end of the grant
term, we expect to a) validate novel ER variants as potential biomarkers that may predict resistance to ER and
CDK4/6 inhibitors, particularly the novel SERDs, b) identify the structural basis by which these novel variants,
and particularly, double hotspot mutations dysregulate ER, and c) identify potential targetable nodes for tumors
that acquire these novel ER mutations. Our results would help design clinical trials to overcome resistance,
and that may avoid unnecessary additional burden of toxicity in heavily pre-treated patients. Developing
biomarkers that predict response to oral SERDs will also enable the stratification of patients whose tumors
express these novel ER variants onto alternate therapeutic regimens without delay (precision medicine). These
studies have strong potential to reduce the mortality associated with breast cancer, and are thus, well-aligned
with the mission of the NCI."

Adverse experiences during childhood and adolescence, especially social isolation and/or disrupted peer
interactions, are major risk factors for the emergence of anxiety and depressive disorders in adulthood.
However, the neural mechanisms through which adolescent social isolation increases the risk for developing
mental illnesses remain poorly understood. The NIMH has established a Research Domain Criteria matrix to
identify molecular and neural mechanisms of various domains of mental function. In this proposal, we utilize
the domain of negative valence systems (NVS; specifically, the constructs of potential/acute threat and loss) to
investigate mechanisms of stress-related problems that are seeded during adolescence. The prefrontal cortex
(PFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and basolateral amygdala (BLA), and especially serotonergic innervation of
these regions from the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR), are all strongly implicated in the dysregulation of NVS. The
DR itself is modulated by corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) projections, including from the bed nucleus of the
stria terminalis (BNST), which regulates stress responses. Our previous studies demonstrate that socially
isolating animals during a critical juncture in development, from early to mid- adolescence (postnatal day (P) 21
to P42) followed by re-socialization, significantly increases hyper-reactivity to aversive stimuli in adulthood. We
also find that the deleterious effects of adolescent social isolation (ASIR) are attenuated by CRF receptor
antagonism within DR, and that ASIR up-regulates CRF2 receptor expression in the DR, resulting in prolonged
serotonin (5-HT) release in the NAc. ASIR also enhances stress-related activity in NVS-related subregions of
the DR which project to PFC, NAc and BLA. Together, these findings support the proposal that isolation-
induced dysregulation of NVS could result from CRF mechanisms in the DR and activation of specific DR
serotonergic outputs. In Aim 1, we will investigate the role of CRF input to the DR on ASIR. We hypothesize
that optogenetic inhibition of CRF outputs within the BNST-DR circuit of isolation-reared Crh-Cre rats will
decrease reactivity to aversive stimuli. In Aim 2, we will determine how ASIR alters neuronal properties and
CRF receptors in key DR output circuits (DR-PFC, DR-NAc, DR-BLA) associated with NVS. We predict that
isolation-reared rats will exhibit altered intrinsic and synaptic excitability, and greater CRF enhancement of
firing (measured with ex vivo brain slice electrophysiology) along with alterations in CRF receptor mRNA
expression in DR-PFC, DR-NAc, and DR-BLA neural circuits. Overall, the studies proposed here will identify
critical neuronal circuit(s) and signaling mechanisms that mediate expression of dysregulated NVS after ASIR."

Schizophrenia (Sz) is a severe mental disorder that affects ~.5% of the population worldwide and is associated
with significant increases in both disability and mortality. Disability is attributable in part to the effects of
cognitive impairments and experiential negative symptoms, while excess mortality is attributable in part to the
effects of increased suicidality early in the disorder and of negative modifiable health risk factors later in the
illness. EEG- and fMRI-based methods have been used extensively to investigate neural mechanisms, but
paradigms and methods differ extensively across groups. Small-scale studies implicate increased urgency as a
risk factor for both aggression and suicidality in schizophrenia, and of loneliness as a driver of increased health
risk but await replication in larger studies. The lack of availability of large scale, open databases that
incorporate both brain imaging and health & wellness information is thus a major barrier to scientific advance in
the field of Sz. The present study leverages the technology and data of the ongoing NIMH-funded (MH124045)
Rockland Sample II (NKI-RSII) study of normal development to create an open data set of multi-modal brain,
physiology and behavior for Sz. As the NKI-RSII, both raw and processed data will be shared online along with
analysis routines and will represent an open resource for clinical investigation. The NKI-RSI (n=1400) and RSII
(n=600) studies collect and share extensive neuroimaging, neurophysiological, physiological and deep
phenotyping data from a community-ascertained, cross-sectional, lifespan sample (ages 6–85 years old).
Design of NKI-RSII was guided by three major themes: 1) multimodal measurement and integration across
functional domains, 2) ecological sampling (e.g., wearables, sensors, smartphone apps), and 3) enhanced
physiological phenotyping for cardiovascular fitness and obesity. Specific multi-modal measures include task-,
resting-state (R-), and natural vision (NV-) fMRI, diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), and naturalistic EEG (NV-
EEG) implemented through the recently developed Mobile Body/Brain Imaging (MoBI)-EEG platform. Relative
brain age (RBA) is calculated using novel multimodal algorithms. Behavioral assessments are drawn from the
NIH Toolbox library and include measures of Companionship, Life Satisfaction and Social Distress. Impulsivity
is evaluated using the UPPS-P. Disability is evaluated using the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule.
Ecological sampling is used to supplement behavioral assessments. Consistent with NKI-RSII procedures, all
data will be shared prospectively via the International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative (INDI) and the
NIMH Data Archive (NDA). Despite the extensive investment in the NKI-RSI and RSII initiatives and the goals
of eventual neuropsychiatric use, no patient data sets are presently collected. This project leverages these
resources to collect a rich data set capable of supporting integrated investigation across neural-, behavioral-
and health-related levels, and will address key hypotheses related to causes and treatment target identification
for the extensive disability and excess mortality associated with Sz."

Adolescent conduct problems, such as aggression, defiance, violence, and criminality, represent a major public
health concern with substantial costs to individuals, their families, and larger society. Current evidence-based
programming addressing adolescent conduct problems is resource intensive and has limited effectiveness.
The proposed R34 study will investigate the feasibility of using a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) as a
new approach to preventing escalations in conduct problems among at-risk youth in a school setting. MBIs
have been demonstrated to support the development of effective self-control, a key risk factor underlying
adolescent conduct problems. However, MBIs have not previously been evaluated for their effectiveness in
preventing the development of serious conduct problems. Notably, previous implementations of MBIs with
adolescents have been limited by a lack of generalization of mindfulness skills in daily life, particularly during
times of stress. The proposed study will enhance an existing evidence-based MBI, Learning to BREATHE
(L2B), with a recently-developed mobile app designed to support greater generalization of skills in daily life and
times of stress. The proposed study will be completed in two primary phases, including Phase 1, a small pilot

 Tissue damage due to injury, disease, or congenital defect continues to be a critical clinical obstacle in
human health. Regenerative medicine-based therapies are a promising strategy, yet the critical determinants of
success are the immune response and fibrosis. Typically, in tissue repair, inflammation is closely controlled
before remodeling by activated fibroblasts, whose presence is also tightly regulated. Immunomodulation is a
promising strategy to avoid fibrotic outcomes, yet it is not the immune cells that directly participate in tissue
remodeling and collagen production. Therefore, it is critical to understand how immune cells coordinate stromal
cells to promote tissue repair or fibrosis. In fibrosis, evidence suggests that chronic immune cell infiltration and
proinflammatory cytokines accompany fibroblasts poised to promote fibrosis. Those fibroblasts are characterized
by aberrant mechanotransduction (i.e. sensing “normal”/soft as stiff/scarred) leading to the overproduction of
ECM. We now know that immune cells and fibroblasts exist as phenotypically distinct subpopulations, including
those with a molecular signature tied to fibrosis. Whether inflammatory signals elicit distinct fibroblast
subpopulations with aberrant mechanotransduction in fibrosis is unknown and is a key objective. Understanding
the relationship between inflammation and fibroblast heterogeneity is essential to predict the regenerative
potential of therapies. I hypothesize that fibroblast subpopulations exist during fibrosis with aberrant
mechanotransduction that is regulated by inflammatory signaling. During the mentored K99 phase of this
application, I will identify the immune and fibroblast subpopulations that emerge during tissue regeneration and
fibrosis leveraging non-fibrotic/regenerative microporous annealed particle hydrogels (MAP gels) and fibrotic
nonporous bulk hydrogels (NP gels). I will determine the mechanotransductive differences across those
subpopulations by purifying them with identified markers and measuring ECM production, myofibroblastic
differentiation, integrin activation, and focal adhesion signaling. I will identify signaling pathways necessary for
the phenotypes unique to fibroblast subpopulations. I will validate these findings by confirming the identified
fibroblast subpopulations and signaling pathways in fibrotic clinical implants. I will continue my scientific and
professional development in preparation for the independent phase with consistent guidance from my scientific
advisory committee, diversity advisory committee, and collaborators. During the independent phase, I will
determine mediators unique to regenerative and fibrotic microenvironments using MAP and NP gels. I determine
if IL-1 signaling in fibroblasts is necessary for fibrosis by implanting NP gels in fibroblast-specific IL-1RI knockout
mice. I will also determine whether IL-1 signaling is sufficient to promote fibrosis using MAP gels conjugated with
IL-1?. We pose an innovative hypothesis that seeks to bridge the gap between inflammation and disrupted
mechanotransduction distinctive of fibrotic disorders. This proposal will equip me with scientific and professional
training that will enable me to launch a successful and diverse research program as an independent investigator."

 Cocaine addiction is a multidimensional psychiatric disorder with pathophysiology that seems to involve
abnormally strong learned associations. These types of learned associations are thought to be encoding within
patterns of sparsely distributed neurons, called neuronal ensembles. Relatively little is known about how
neuronal ensembles controlling cocaine-seeking differ from those underlying natural reward seeking. We have
recently found that a small molecule, Rac1, is differentially expressed in cocaine-paired neuronal ensembles
compared to food-paired ensembles. This molecule may represent a unique molecular adaptation that defines
the cocaine-seeking ensemble. There is, therefore, a critical need to determine the role or Rac1 in cocaine-
seeking ensembles. The long-term goal is to determine the neural mechanisms underlying drug memories to
enable development of clinically useful therapies to alleviate craving and relapse of cocaine use disorder. The
overall objective in this application is to the role of Rac1 in the behavioral, structural, and activity of cocaine-
ensemble neurons. Our central hypothesis is that Rac1 signaling is integral to cocaine-induced
neuroadaptations, driving neuroadaptations that increase the cue-reactivity of cocaine ensemble neurons and
drive cocaine-seeking behavior. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding how Rac1
expression effects the neuronal ensembles governing cocaine-seeking behavior will provide new opportunities
for developing experimental therapeutics to treating cocaine use disorder. To attain the overall objectives, the
following specific aims will be pursued: 1) Determine the impact of IL ensemble Rac1 activity on cocaine-seeking
behavior; 2) Identify changes in cellular structure within cocaine-associated neuronal ensembles; and 3)
Determine the role of Rac1 activity on cue reactivity of cocaine ensemble neurons. The research proposed in
this application is innovative because it dissects the role of Rac1 within neuronal ensembles in cocaine self-
administration compared to food-seeking ensembles using several cutting-edge methods. These contributions
will have significant impact because they are expected to have determined how Rac1 drives adaptations within
the neuronal ensembles mediating cocaine-seeking."
10954040,"Image-guided thermal ablation (IGTA) is a minimally invasive, low cost, and accessible cancer treatment for
patients including those who are too ill to be candidates for surgery or radiotherapy. However, it remains under-
utilized due to relatively higher recurrence rates. This is likely due to inaccurate estimates of treatment zone
boundaries. This research program proposes to address this challenge by applying advanced techniques in
image analysis (specifically deep learning) to detect and mitigate potentially undetected incomplete treatment in
liver tumor ablation through multiple stages of the procedure and follow-up period. These critical improvements
will help broaden the applicability and increase the success rate of IGTA, while maintaining its many advantages.
Specifically, we will develop a novel fully automated pipeline of kidney segmentation and registration based on
deep learning that could reduce the impact of undetected incomplete treatment, improve years of cancer-free
survival, and make IGTA a more attractive therapy for more patients. We hypothesize that 1) deep learning
techniques can segment the kidney and the renal lesion in a manner indistinguishable from experienced
radiologists and 2) deep learning can supplant biomedical modeling in generating deformation vector fields at a
speed that is suitable for clinical application. The deliverables from our work would improve the treatment of renal
tumor in several ways. First, the 3-dimensional assessment of delivered ablation zone based on pre-operative
diagnostic quality images will establish “virtual margins” when the patient is still on the table and allow real-time
adjustments by the operator to decrease recurrence rates. Second, the inclusion of the entire process within a
single deep learning architecture will make a single, easily implementable program for the clinic.
The proposed research is interdisciplinary, engaging clinicians and imaging scientists in a comprehensive effort
to curate a large amount of high quality treatment imaging and to leverage this data in developing deep learning
algorithms for segmentation and registration, and prediction strategies that are well-suited to this problem domain.
The technology would facilitate identification of incomplete treatment in real-time and use pre-operative
diagnostic quality images to improve accuracy in estimating the treatment zone, resulting in a decrease in the
rate of post-treatment recurrence."

Transcription growth factor beta (TGFβ) is a pleiotropic cytokine with a significant role in creating an
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. High levels of TGFβ are strongly associated with poor cancer
prognosis, but there are currently no non-invasive methods available to quantify the cytokine in vivo. This
proposal describes the design and evaluation of a novel biologic positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer
to selectively and quantitatively detect TGFβ in vivo. The proposed biologic construct is a recombinant protein
incorporating the extracellular domain of human TGFβ receptor II (TβRII) linked to the Fc fragment of human
IgG2 via the antibody hinge region. This recombinant protein was further modified by appending 1,4,7-
triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA) copper chelator via a p-SCN-Bn reactive moiety. The resulting
precursor molecule will be labeled with 64Cu to produce the active radiotracer, 64Cu-Fc:TβRII. The 64Cu-Fc:TβRII
radiotracer will be evaluated for preclinical efficacy by imaging mice using small animal PET-MRI. This proposal
aims to assess the efficacy of 64Cu-Fc:TβRII including a dose titration experiment to determine the optimal
dosage and incubation time for the radiotracer, a blocking study, a comparison of in vivo PET standardized
uptake values (SUVs) with ex vivo tumor lysate TGFβ concentrations in four murine tumor models, and an
experiment to detect changes in TGFβ expression before and after radiation therapy."
10954354,"ABSTRACT. Mania/hypomania, the defining symptom of Bipolar Disorder (BD), is extremely disabling, leading
to significantly impaired health and psychosocial function. Yet, current treatments often have severe side effects;
and relapse rates are high. Pathophysiologically-based treatments, guided by an understanding of the
neurobiological mechanisms predisposing to mania/hypomania in BD, are urgently needed to treat and reduce
recurrence of this defining BD symptom. We seek to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying two
key characteristics that predispose to, and are associated with, mania/hypomania: elevated reward sensitivity/
goal overvaluation and higher than normal levels of often risky, approach-oriented decision-making and behavior,
which can be triggered in uncertain reward expectancy (RE) and approach-avoidance decision-making contexts.
Based on our prior work, we hypothesize that these characteristics result from: abnormally elevated activity and
connectivity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC)-reward network (RNet) but abnormally low or no change
in activity and connectivity in the central executive network (CEN), and lower CEN-RNet connectivity, especially
in the latter decision-making context, for which the etiology is elevated dopamine (DA) release in the RNet. Our
goal is to rigorously assess RNet and CEN DA release in 40 unmedicated euthymic BD adults experiencing
subsyndromal mania/hypomania, and 40 healthy control adults (HC), using positron emission tomography (PET)
during oral amphetamine (AMPH) challenge. By examining relationships among RNet and CEN fMRI activity,
functional and effective connectivity (FC, EC), DA release, and subsyndromal mania/hypomania and AMPH-
induced increases in mania/hypomania, we will advance understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms
underlying mania/hypomania predisposition in BD. We will use [11C]raclopride PET and AMPH challenge to
measure striatal DA release; [11C]FLB457 PET and AMPH challenge to measure cortical DA release; and
midbrain (substantia nigra pars compacta/ventral tegmental area, SNc/VTA) neuromelanin contrast-to-noise
ratio (NM CNR) as a measure of cumulative DA synthesis, to examine relationships between this measure and
AMPH-induced DA release. We aim to: 1. Compare groups on: left vlPFC-RNet activity, FC and EC during
uncertain RE and approach-avoidance decision-making; right dlPFC-CEN activity, FC and EC, and CEN-RNet
FC, EC, during the latter context; and indices of approach-avoidance decision-making; 2. Compare groups on,
and examine relationships among: RNet and CEN striatal and prefrontal cortical PET-measured DA release, and
SNc/VTA NM CNR; 3. Examine associations among RNet and CEN DA release, network-respective fMRI
measures, and indices of approach-avoidance decision-making; 4. Examine relationships among AMPH-induced
changes in, and subsyndromal baseline, mania/hypomania and imaging measures; and group differences in
AMPH-induced changes in mania/hypomania. Our work will elucidate neural network DA release abnormalities
predisposing to mania/hypomania, to help develop targeted therapeutics with fewer side effects."
10972716,"Youth brought into the legal system face diminished psychological wellbeing and heightened psychological distress compared with peers who have not been arrested, on average, impairing current quality of life and long-term whole person health. Emotion dysregulation appears to contribute to low wellbeing and high distress on the individual level, and it can be improved via mindfulness meditation. Meditation can be taught by smartphone app, reaching youth on probation in their daily lives. In a prior study (K99/R00DA047890), we collaborated with a range of stakeholders in Chicago Cook County, the 2nd largest juvenile legal system in the U.S., to identify determinants (i.e., barriers and facilitators) of implementing a 1-month mindfulness meditation app with youth on probation, create a multi-component implementation plan, and run a fully remote feasibility clinical trial. Preliminary mixed-methods data strongly supported feasibility, including successful recruitment, enrollment, and randomization of n=50 youth on probation; high objective app usage (i.e., adherence); and high retention at 1 (86%) and 6 (81%) months. Study activities included adapting an app comprised of evidence-based meditation practices for relevance to youth on probation, creating a control app matched for time and structure, and automating systems to identify and re-engage non-users of both apps. Now, our team faces critical barriers to building on these successes and running a fully-powered trial that can produce effectiveness and implementation data generalizable beyond a single site. On the individual level, youths’ backgrounds differ across legal systems; determining if youth from diverse backgrounds will adequately adhere to the meditation app is a key concern. Organizationally, marked heterogeneity across legal systems precludes uniform approaches to recruiting, enrolling, and retaining youth, and can impact health and implementation outcomes. The proposed study will thus expand feasibility testing into 4 rural and urban counties (i.e., sites) in 2 new states: Oregon and New York. Our team will form relationships in each county and conduct theoretically-guided interviews to (a) identify determinants of implementing the meditation app and running the trial at each site, and (b) guide corresponding refinements to our recruitment, retention, and other procedures. Youth on probation (n=120; 30/site) will then be individually randomized to use the meditation or control app for 30 days. Youth will report on health outcomes (wellbeing and distress) at baseline, 1, and 6 months, and complete “bursts” of ecological momentary assessment at baseline and 1 month to capture the mechanistic target (emotion dysregulation) in real time. Also at 1 month, youth, officers, and leadership at each site will interview on feasibility. These mixed-methods data will inform the development of a hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial spanning diverse counties in Oregon, Illinois, and New York. The present study is thus a carefully-designed step toward promoting scalable programming that holds the potential to improve whole person health and help address health disparities among legal-involved youth."

Cells in the human body are exposed to a broad range of mechanical forces. Cells respond to such mechanical
stimuli with the expression of specific mechanoresponsive genes, enabling the cells to adapt to their physical
environment. This ‘mechanotransduction’ process is particularly important in tissues subjected to large and
highly variable mechanical stresses, such as skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and skin, where impaired
mechanotransduction can lead to muscular dystrophy, heart disease, and other pathologies. Research on
mechanotransduction mechanisms has typically focused on proteins at the cell surface and in the cytoskeleton,
along with the signaling pathways activated by these proteins. Recent studies and our preliminary data using
advanced techniques to detect rapid changes in gene expression, however, found that mechanical stimulation
induces expression of mechanoresponsive genes faster than the time needed for cytoplasmic signaling
cascades to reach the nuclear interior, suggesting the existence of novel, yet to be determined
mechanotransduction mechanisms. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify the mechanism
responsible for this ‘ultra-rapid’ induction of mechanoresponsive genes and to determine the functional
consequences of impaired nuclear mechanotransduction. Given the importance of mechanotransduction in
muscle development, maintenance, and disease, the proposed research will focus on skeletal muscle cells.
Nonetheless, insights gained from this research are expected to be also broadly applicable to many other cell
types. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the nucleus is not just a receiver of cytoplasmic
mechanotransduction signals, but actively participates in transducing mechanical forces in changes in gene
expression. Supporting this idea, deletion or mutation of nuclear envelope proteins that physically connect the
nucleus to the cytoskeleton, such as lamins and components of the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton
(LINC) complex, lead to impaired activation of mechanoresponsive genes and cause various muscle diseases.
Nonetheless, how these proteins, and the nucleus in general, participate in cellular mechanotransduction and
interface with established mechanotransduction pathways remains unresolved. The specific aims of the
proposed work are to (1) determine the molecular mechanisms for the ultra-rapid mechanically induced gene
expression and (2) define the role of nucleo-cytoskeletal force transmission, the LINC complex, and lamins in
the mechanotransduction process in muscle cells. The long-term goal is to understand the fundamental
mechanisms by which cells sense and respond to their physical environment, and to determine the effect of
disease-causing mutations on this process. Gaining better mechanistic insights into how mechanical stimulation
activates mechanoresponsive genes in skeletal muscle is critical to the development of new targeted therapeutic
approaches for diseases such as muscular dystrophy caused by perturbed cellular mechanotransduction."
10973050,"We propose to generate and validate a novel model that incorporates human cerebral cortical neurons and glia, vascular endothelial cells, neural crest pericytes and microglia from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The goal is a model with improved construct, face, and predictive validity to study the cerebro-vascular interactions common to Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias (ADRD). The NINDS 2022 ADRD summit report describes the need for such a model. In prior studies we developed a reproducible human 3D cerebral cortex organoid model tested across 63 iPSC lines with 90% success. It improved efficiency in organoid production from 10% to approaching 100%. Organoids grown with the protocol have uniform size, shape, predictable growth curves and cell composition. Single cell transcriptome studies demonstrate high overlap between iPSC lines from different donors, an important advance for studies of both genetic and sporadic disease. We also recently developed an iPSC-derived 3D vasculature model forming robust, vessel-like structures of endothelial cells and pericytes in an inert hydrogel. Preliminary studies demonstrate that these two advanced models can be integrated to generate a human cell 3D cerebro-vascular model. In Aim 1, the R61 phase, we will optimize the incorporation of these two models to achieve greatest reproducibility of cell composition reflecting vascularized cerebral cortical tissue in vivo. The model will be generated from at least three different PSEN1 mutation iPSC lines versus healthy controls. There is significant need for this model given that current PSEN1 mutation transgenic and knock-in mouse models lack several key features of neuro- and vascular pathology seen in human disease. Quantitative metrics will be used to assess efficiency and reproducibility of the model and its ability to reproduce PSEN1 mutation cortical pathology, including cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). With the achievement of prospectively determined quantitative criteria, we will advance to the R33 phase of the project. In Aim 2, the PSEN1 mutation models will be examined for face, construct, and predictive validity. This phase will include collaborators with expertise in examining PSEN1 mutation carrier tissue pathology, brain single nuclear transcriptomes, metabolomics, lipidomics, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition. We will assess established characteristics of PSEN1 mutation-induced cerebral pathology, such as altered expression of A40,42 and 43, and tau. Validation tests will include those used for clinical evaluation where test sensitivity, dynamic range and predictive value are known. The predictive validity of the model will be assessed by comparing PSEN1 mutation to genetic controls, including CRISPR engineered isogenic control lines. In addition, we will assess the impact of antibody therapies that are approved for PSEN1 mutation carriers, to determine whether they can bind A species, offset other signs of pathology, and offer insight pertinent to drug-related vascular side-effects. We will demonstrate independent replication of the model in a different institution lab to demonstrate robustness. Transparent sharing of detailed protocols and data will aid adoption of the model."

term consequences. It has been shown that intestinal inflammation can lead to enteric neuronal injury and
subsequent intestinal dysfunction, including disorders of gut motility. Damage to the enteric nervous system
(ENS) may also contribute to the development and severity of intestinal inflammation. Therefore, the ENS
emerges as a critical participant in immunomodulation within the gut. Previous studies have demonstrated
that cholinergic neurons directly interact with muscularis macrophages, and their numbers are reduced in
inflammation. Our preliminary data show for the first time that selective optogenetic stimulation of cholinergic
neurons attenuates colitis, while ablation of enteric cholinergic neurons worsens inflammation in DSS-
induced acute colitis. We hypothesize that enteric cholinergic signalling can be harnessed as a novel
therapeutic strategy for the treatment of IBD. In the proposed study, we will first determine the mechanism
by which cholinergic signaling attenuates inflammation by investigating the impact of cholinergic neuronal
activation on muscularis macrophage polarization and cytokine production. Second, we will use optogenetics
to selectively stimulate enteric cholinergic neurons in Winnie mice, a well-established model of chronic colitis
that closely resembles human IBD to determine the effect of cholinergic signaling on disease onset and the
severity of inflammation. As parameters of anti-inflammatory activity, we will investigate changes in
morphology and inflammatory indices, as well as changes in smooth muscle contractility and motility as
measured by organ bath experiments and electromyography. These studies will provide important insights
into the mechanisms by which cholinergic neurons can improve colitis and offer a potential novel treatment
strategy for IBD."

Although venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a disease of aging, the current evidence base neglects older
adults’ priorities, which prevents patients and clinicians from making individualized VTE treatment decisions.
VTE and its treatment are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality for older adults, yet existing data
offer few insights into real-world VTE outcomes in older adults, and the current age-agnostic decision
framework does not incorporate their unique experiences or values. Aging-focused evidence on VTE that
expands beyond disease-focused predictors and outcomes would guide a new paradigm for treatment and
improved quality of care.
My overarching goal is to build a backbone of data to support individualized treatment decisions among older
adults with VTE using qualitative methods to elucidate core decision-making priorities, high-quality existing
data to detail how VTE is associated with aging-related characteristics and outcomes, and risk prediction
modeling to estimate bleeding risk specific to older adults on long-term anticoagulants to prevent recurrent
VTE. These insights will inform subsequent interventions to align VTE treatment with current best practices
from geriatrics and older adults’ values.
We propose the following Aims: Aim 1) Engage stakeholders to identify core components of individualized VTE
treatment decision-making for older adults, Aim 2) Use two powerful and complementary existing data sources
to describe the presentation, treatment, and outcomes of VTE in two large cohorts of older adults with VTE,
and Aim 3) Develop and externally validate a clinical risk model incorporating geriatric syndromes to predict
anticoagulation-related bleeding in older adults after VTE. This proposal will have a significant impact because
it will produce evidence to guide a paradigm for VTE treatment that is founded on older adults’ experiences
and priorities and will result in improved care. Through this award, I will obtain advanced training in stakeholder
engagement, user-centered design and clinical trials of design aids, experience building a real-world cohort
and advanced causal inference methods, and risk prediction modeling, along with mentorship from national
leaders in the field. This research and training will provide a foundation for my long-term goal of transitioning to
an independent researcher to develop interventions to improve the health and well-being of older adults with
non-malignant hematologic diseases."
10954517,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is one of the most common forms of acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain, 
a common cause for opioid use, and affects 10-15% of patients seen in general medical clinics. Central to this 
syndrome are myofascial trigger points (MTrPs), hard, palpable, discrete, and localized nodules that produce 
referred pain and local tenderness at the site upon compression. Despite its prevalence and clinical significance, 
the pathophysiology of MPS is not well understood. The subjective nature of current diagnostic methods and a 
lack of objective markers of MPS, hinders the precision of diagnosis and treatment. There is therefore a clinical 
need for improved diagnostic tools sensitive to the complex multifactorial (compositional, vascular and 
neurogenic) factors of MPS, that can unravel the intricate mechanisms of MPS and enhance patient care.
Imaging offers objective measures of multiple disease features to improve the diagnosis and assessment of 
MTrPs and MPS. MRI, with its excellent soft-tissue contrast, can provide detailed anatomical information of 
skeletal muscle and fascia. Further, quantitative methods can probe muscle microstructure [Diffusion Tensor 
Imaging (DTI) and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI)], microcirculatory velocity [Intravoxel Incoherent Motion 
(IVIM)], local contraction (dynamic Diffusion Weighted Imaging), muscle and fascial fibrosis and densification 
[Ultra-Short Echo Time (UTE) MRI]. Synergistically, PET imaging, with its sensitivity to functional and metabolic 
process, provides a tool for assessment of inflammatory processes including neurogenic inflammation.
This work aims to develop PET and MRI methods to identify novel imaging biomarkers that can diagnose and 
characterize MTrPs in MPS. Our Specific Aims are (1) develop clinically-translatable [18F]FDG PET-MRI imaging 
markers that can reflect disease and pain mechanisms and characterize MTrPs in MPS; (2) evaluate whether 
PET and MRI biomarkers are able to differentiate the microstructural, compositional, functional and metabolic 
changes in MPS patients from normal myofascial and neurogenic features in age and sex matched controls as 
between MPS patients with pain in their upper back muscles (Trapezius, Rhomboid Major an Minor, and Levator 
Scapulae) and the same muscles on their non-painful contralateral side. If successful, based on an receiver 
operator characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.7, we will (3) evaluate our imaging approaches 
in a single-blind randomized clinical trial of patients being treated with ultrasound guided muscle anesthetic 
injections and a sham injection to evaluate treatment response and differences between treatment groups.
The significance of our work is the development of novel biomarkers that can objectively diagnosis and 
characterize tissue level changes in MTrPs and MPS . Our key innovation is the development of PET and MRI 
tools to assess specific mechanisms of theorized MPS and MTrPs pathophysiology as well as mechanisms of 
pain generation in MPS. Our investigative team includes experts in novel imaging techniques, clinical 
assessment and treatment of pain, and clinical studies evaluating both imaging markers and treatment response."

There has been an increase in availability of evidence-based approaches for interventions and mental health
service delivery in low-resource settings. In low- and middle-income countries this includes delivery of services
by people who are not mental health specialists in primary care and community settings. However, there
continues to be major gaps in delivery of evidence-based mental health services. In order to improve service
delivery, we propose a quality assessment tool that can be completed by people with lived experience of
mental health conditions who use services in primary care settings. When service users rate the quality of the
care they receive, this feedback can be provided to health system managers and policy makers to aid in their
decision making for improved mental health services. The quality assessment tool will be co-created by
patients and their caregivers using health services (demand side in the healthcare system) and managers and
policy makers (supply side in the healthcare system). Based on this co-creation process, service users will be
able to complete assessments to rate quality indicators such as communication skills of service providers, the
physical space for confidential clinical encounters, the availability of medication, referrals for psychological
services, and use of patient education materials. The tool will differ from standard patient satisfaction tools that
typically use subjective Likert scoring. Instead, the assessment tool will be based on a series of observations of
provider behaviors, treatment and educational resources, and facility infrastructure. The quality assessment
tool will be designed using the formatting of the World Health Organization Ensuring Quality in Psychological
Support and Mental Health Helping Skill (EQUIP) platform, with the intention that the tool could eventually be
made freely available on the platform alongside other care ratings resources. By completion of this research
study, there will be an EQUIP quality assessment tool that can be completed by service users. The tool will
have been piloted in two low-resource settings: Liberia and Nepal. There will also be adequate capacity
building and other formative work completed to conduct a larger scale multi-site evaluation of quality
improvement using this tool rated by health care service users."

10973042,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Individuals with Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are significantly more
likely to have increased AD biomarkers (e.g. amyloid β) and higher risks of developing Alzheimer’s Disease
and Related Dementias (ADRD). Sleep disturbances have been associated with increased risks preclinical AD,
ADRD, and all-cause dementia. However, most of these studies focus on sleep’s association with the
incidence of SCD, MCI, or dementia individually, rather than the progression of cognitive impairment from SCD
to MCI to dementia. The latter is of key clinical importance when attempting to halt or treat AD progression. In
addition to sleep, recent studies have shown that physical frailty is also closely interrelated with cognitive
impairment, with evidence that they predict one another, share common risk factors, and have similar potential
mechanisms. The co-existence of both physical frailty and cognitive impairment (MCI/SCD), also known as
cognitive frailty, is supposed to be a predictor of severe health consequences with the synergic negative
effects of both. However, this synergic effect on future cognitive decline and progression to dementia is still
underexamined in the literature. Moreover, given the interrelationship between physical frailty and cognitive
impairment, it is possible that physical frailty moderates the associations between sleep disturbances and
progression from SCD/MCI to dementia. Therefore, the overall goal of this project is to investigate the roles of
sleep disturbances and physical frailty in SCD/MCI’s cognitive progression and explore whether physical frailty
is a moderator of sleep’s association with the cognitive progression. In the F99 phase, the PI will use six waves
of longitudinal Health and Retirement Study data from the 2010 to 2020 to examine the associations of
baseline self-reported insomnia symptoms and physical frailty with 10-year cognitive trajectories and
subsequent incidence of MCI/dementia in SCD. In the K00 phase, the PI will shift the population to MCI, a
more advanced AD stage, with a focus on actigraphy-measured sleep and neuroimaging cognition measures.
The PI will use the UK Biobank data to examine the associations of sleep (both actigraphy-derived and self-
reported) and physical frailty with brain structure (magnetic resonance imaging data), subsequent cognitive
function, and incident ADRD among older adults with MCI. In both phases, physical frailty will be examined as
a moderator in the associations between sleep and cognitive outcomes. This research will help to pinpoint at-
risk populations for ADRD, advance understanding of the roles of sleep and physical frailty in ADRD
progression in SCD and MCI, and suggest strategies for delaying AD/dementia progression through the lens of
sleep and physical frailty. Further, the training objectives nested in the F99 and K00 phases of this award will
allow the PI to gain necessary knowledges and skills to develop into an independent investigator in aging
research, with a focus on the sleep and cognitive health in older adults."
10973118,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hypertensive stimuli activate innate and adaptive immune cells which then act on target organs such as the
kidney and vasculature causing tissue injury/inflammation and hypertensive end-organ damage. We and others
have shown that depleting subsets of immune cells or individual cytokines in rodent models is indeed protective
against these deleterious effects of hypertension. Yet there are currently no immunomodulatory therapies for
hypertension, which affects nearly 50% of adults worldwide. A major reason for this is that immunosuppressive
therapies would render a large percentage of people susceptible to infection and malignancy. A final common
pathway of immune activation in experimental and human hypertension is the skewing of T cell subsets towards
pro-inflammatory T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which secrete interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and IL-21, and away from anti-
inflammatory regulatory T cells (Treg). There is emerging evidence that Rho-associated protein kinase 2
(ROCK2) acts as a molecular switch in T helper cells by promoting Th17 differentiation, via phosphorylation of
STAT3 and IRF4, and inhibiting Treg differentiation. In this proposal, we will test the novel hypothesis that
hypertension is associated with activation of a ROCK2/STAT3/IRF4 pathway in T cells that leads to increased
Th17/Treg ratios and exacerbated hypertension and inflammatory damage. Furthermore, we propose that
selectively inhibiting ROCK2 will restore a homeostatic T cell balance without causing global
immunosuppression. A novel orally bioavailable selective ROCK2 inhibitor, KD025, has completed phase 2/3
clinical trials for IL-17A/IL-21 mediated autoimmune diseases with a favorable safety profile and no apparent
increased risk of infection. We have novel preliminary data that KD025 significantly reduces BP and increases
Treg/Th17 cell ratios in the kidney in response to experimental hypertension. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will
use inducible conditional ROCK2 deficient mice to determine cell-specific roles of ROCK2 in hypertension. To
determine whether T cell ROCK2 deletion restores the Th17/Treg balance in hypertension with minimal effects
on other cell types, we will use a novel single cell technique, called CITE-Seq, to phenotype circulating leukocytes
as well as perform functional assays of immune function using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) model of systemic
inflammation. In Aim 2, we will determine the effect of KD025 on BP, Th17/Treg balance, end-organ damage,
and LPS-induced inflammation in response to hypertensive stimuli. In Aim 3, we will use peripheral blood T cells
from normotensive and hypertensive humans to determine whether T cell ROCK2 activity is increased in
hypertension. To determine causality, we will adoptively transfer T cells from humans into immunodeficient mice
to determine whether human T cells promote hypertension and renal/vascular inflammation in a ROCK2
dependent manner in humanized mice. Our team is uniquely poised to conduct these translational studies that
will potentially transform immunomodulatory therapies for hypertension and its associated complications."
10973119,"Project Abstract:
Circuit assembly, the collection of sequential developmental steps that ultimately lead to the formation of
synapses, is a conserved process that determines organismal function and behavior. In humans, billions of
neurons make trillions of synapses, and proper circuit function depends on correct synaptic partnerships.
Perturbations in circuit assembly can lead to devastating neurodevelopmental diseases. While it is generally
accepted that synaptic connectivity is determined by cell surface receptor interactions, only a relatively small
number of these receptors have been identified, and the developmental signaling pathways downstream of these
molecules remain mostly uncharacterized. Given the complexity of nervous systems, we need to expedite the
discovery of neural receptor/ligand pairs and learn how they signal in order to understand brain development
and the physiology of diseases where neural wiring is fundamental. Our labs leverage biochemical and genetic
insights into cell surface protein interactions to identify new connectivity codes and corresponding signaling
pathways. Previously, in an unbiased protein interaction biochemical screen, we identified two Drosophila
interaction networks within the immunoglobulin superfamily – Dprs/DIPs and Beats/Sides. These “interaction
codes” guide cell-cell interactions that underlie circuit assembly. Most members of these families bind each other
in a complex yet specific manner; for example, each Dpr can interact with a specific subset of DIPs and vice
versa. The expression patterns of these proteins are stereotyped, and combinatorial expression of Dprs, DIPs,
Beats and/or Sides has been observed, likely serving as unique identity markers on cell surfaces. Deletion of
these proteins lead to neural connectivity phenotypes, and specifically for Dpr11 and DIP-γ, misregulation of
BMP signaling and neuronal death. Here, we propose to uncover the molecular pathways that are downstream
of Dpr-DIP interactions and discover and study other cell surface receptors and secreted proteins that mediate
Dpr/DIP function via direct interactions. Our exciting preliminary results already revealed new co-receptors, and
follow-up experiments will include biophysical and structural characterization of these new interactions, followed
by signaling assays in culture and genetic perturbations in vivo to establish functional roles for these interactions.
Furthermore, we will reveal the structural basis of Beat-Side interactions, examine their complexes, manipulate
the hetero and homodimeric binding abilities of these proteins and test them using established phenotypes in
the embryonic and larval neuromuscular system."

 No vaccines are currently licensed to prevent human brucellosis and existing vaccines for
livestock are not entirely efficacious. In humans and other animals, Brucella can cause a lifelong
infection. However, mechanisms underlying the ability of Brucella to subvert adaptive immunity
remain unclear. In this proposal we show that vaccine elicited antibodies alter host metabolism to
protect the host against Brucella to some degree. Therefore, in Specific Aim #1 of this proposal
we will determine how vaccine-elicited IgM and class switched antibodies alter tissue metabolism
to restrict Brucella infection. We also found that Brucella encodes virulence factors that mediate
evasion of humoral immunity. Therefore, in Specific Aim #2 of this proposal we will identify
mechanisms by which Brucella subverts antibody mediated immunity. Collectively, our results will
enhance our understanding of how current vaccines protect the host, and how Brucella is able to
subvert adaptive immunity, and thus could improve the rational design of highly effective vaccines
for Brucella."

 Hypertension disproportionately affects Black women and is a key risk factor for cardiovascular
disease, a leading cause of death. As many as 39.9% of Black women have hypertension compared to
Asian women (21.9%), Hispanic women (28%), and White women (25.6%). Among women with
hypertension, Black women are 2.3 times more likely than white women to have uncontrolled blood
pressure (BP). Physical activity can reduce hypertension risk and incidence, but rates are low among
Black women. The vast majority of Black women (83.3%), are not meeting the national guidelines for
physical activity. Stress is known as a key risk factor for hypertension as well as a major barrier to
physical activity among Black women.
 To address hypertension and physical activity disparities among Black women, we propose a
technology-delivered mindful walking intervention to reduce stress, increase PA, and ultimately reduce
blood pressure in Black women with hypertension. We will leverage culturally-relevant frameworks on
stress among Black women such as the Superwoman Schema to understand the role of stress on health
outcomes in Black women to tailor the intervention. We will conduct focus groups with N=30 Black
women with hypertension who are insufficiently active to gather insights about 1) barriers and facilitators
to engaging in physical activity, 2) views of the Superwoman Schema, and 3) perspectives on a remotely
delivered mindful walking intervention, including the modality, goals, walking pad, and content. Using
the ORBIT model for intervention design, we will then develop and test the intervention in a 1-arm proof
of concept study. Findings will inform the development of the intervention in preparation for an efficacy
trial. We will enroll N=30 Black women into a 12-week Facebook-delivered mindful walking
intervention. Feasibility outcomes will include recruitment, retention, engagement, and acceptability.
Following this proof-of-concept test, we will conduct post intervention focus groups with participants to
further refine the intervention.
 Building on Dr. Kalinowski’s prior pilot work on mindfulness and hypertension in Black women,
this study will provide her with training in designing, developing, and implementing technology-delivered
physical activity interventions to reduce CVD risk among Black women. This project contributes to Dr.
Kalinowski’s long-term goal of designing technology-delivered physical activity interventions that can be
leveraged to reduce CVD burden among Black women. Dr. Kalinowski has access to a rich research
environment at the University of Connecticut along with expert mentors who are dedicated to her training

10949827,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common non-cutaneous cancer in U.S. men and causes sexual dysfunction
in up to 90% of patients. Sexual dysfunction is associated with long-term reductions in psychological health
and quality of life. Addressing sexual dysfunction is a critical component of PCa care that requires effective
patient-provider communication, as communication facilitates access to evidence-based sexual dysfunction
therapies. Our prior qualitative studies identified gaps in patient-provider communication about sexual health
as a key barrier to patients’ sexual recovery. Although most U.S. patients receive sexual health counseling
from PCa providers, many patients do not discuss their sexual health concerns with providers despite a desire
for help. PCa patients face significant barriers to communicating with providers about sexual dysfunction,
including loss of confidence due to impaired masculinity as a result of dysfunction. Furthermore, lack of patient
communication about sexual health is associated with worse quality of life. Although there is a critical need for
an intervention to improve PCa patients’ sexual health communication with providers, no efficacious
interventions exist. Starting the Conversation (STC) is an evidence-based sexual health communication skills
training intervention that has proven efficacious in improving breast cancer patients’ self-efficacy for sexual
health communication with providers, rates of sexual health communication with providers, and sexual health.
STC is a patient-facing, self-directed, multimedia intervention, and the core elements of the skills training are
broadly applicable across cancer type and stage. However, in its current format, STC focuses on female
cancer survivors’ sexual health concerns and does not address PCa patients’ barriers to communication.
Therefore, to address the critical need for an intervention to improve PCa patients’ sexual health
communication with providers, we propose to rigorously adapt STC for PCa and to pilot test the adapted
intervention. In Aim 1, we will conduct focus groups with PCa patients and individual interviews with PCa
providers to identify barriers and facilitators of patient-provider communication about sexual health in PCa care
and elicit feedback to adapt STC for PCa. In Aim 2, we will conduct usability testing with PCa patients to refine
the intervention. In Aim 3, we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of STC adapted for PCa to assess
feasibility outcomes and preliminary effects of STC on patients’ self-efficacy for sexual health communication
with providers, rates of sexual health communication with providers, and sexual health. Conducting this study
will contribute to Dr. Gupta’s development into an independent investigator with expertise in sexual health and
urologic cancer survivorship, community engagement in research, development of behavioral interventions
(with a focus on patient-provider communication), design and conduct of behavioral intervention trials, and
dissemination and implementation science. Findings from this study will generate preliminary data for a future
NCI R01 submission for a definitive efficacy trial of the proposed intervention."

AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), is applying state-of-the-art metabolomics and lipidomics technologies
combined with genomic and imaging data to map metabolic failures across the spectrum and trajectory of AD-
ADRDs. The ADMC is part of the Accelerating Medicines Partnership for AD (AMP-AD), a flagship precompetitive
partnership that brings government, industry, and nonprofit organizations together to transform the current model
for developing new AD diagnostics and treatments. Our work confirmed that peripheral metabolic changes,
influenced by the exposome, inform about cognitive and brain imaging changes and ATN markers for disease,
highlighting peripheral and central changes are connected in part, through the metabolome. The Alzheimer Gut
Microbiome Project (AGMP) that we launched in partnership with ten AD Research Centers (ADRC) and large
diet and lifestyle interventions (POINTER, MIND, BEAT-AD) aims to define the influences of the gut microbiome,
diet, and gut-brain axis in AD. This research infrastructure is building the first AD molecular atlas that captures
exposome influences on AD-associated metabolomic profiles. Five metabolomic centers of excellence are
completing a ring trial to identify environmental chemical exposures, dietary components, and drug signatures
that when linked to gut microbiome and metabolomic data will define exposome profiles associated with
AD/ADRDs. In this U01, we leverage a large NIA-funded collaborative infrastructure, connections to 10 ADRCs,
and access to unique community-based longitudinal cohort studies and biobanks (FHS, ROSMAP, Rotterdam,
UK Biobank) to: (i) expand coverage of the chemical exposome in blood and brain, and (ii) link identified
signatures to brain aging, incident dementia, and AD. Human data generated in this project will inform and be
informed by results from complementary preclinical exposome studies in AD mouse models (AG-24-023) and
cell-based systems (AG-24-241). A long-standing partnership with Sage Bionetworks allows for rapid sharing of
exposome data collected under this application through the AD Knowledge Portal. We will leverage data
generated under the AMP-AD, AGMP, and this U01 to enable data harmonization with existing data generated
in the AMP-AD and AGMP with the goal of integrating of complex exposure data across multiple cohorts. This
project provides an unparalleled opportunity to create a deeper understanding of how the exposome interacts
with genetics, gut microbiome, and metabolome to modulate AD pathogenesis, potentially leading to novel
therapeutic approaches and preventative measures for AD that address ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic
diversity. Our European and USA partners connect us with large exposome initiatives including in the
Netherlands and “The Human Health Exposure Analysis Resource” (HHEAR) network."

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has become a powerful tool for studying the underlying
functional architecture of brain networks by tracking temporal correlations in the activity of different brain regions;
a technique called resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC). Recently, individualized methods of rs-FC have
revealed reliable differences in functional organization between individuals and group averages that have been
implicated with differences in behavior. These precision fMRI methods involve collecting extended amounts of
rs-FC data across multiple sessions for each subject and the use of advanced denoising techniques to improve
the quality of the data. Individual-specific networks have not been examined in older adults yet, even though
group-average studies suggest that brain networks change systematically over the course of the lifespan and as
a function of disease, both in cortical and cerebellar regions. I propose the use of a dataset of highly sampled
older adults, ages 60-75 (N = 38), and younger adults, ages 18-30 (N = 38), to create individual-specific
parcellations and network representations using high-quality anatomical and rs-FC data. In Aim 1, I will examine
whether the properties of individualized networks in older adults differ compared to young adults. In Aim 2, I will
examine whether the networks affected in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) differ from those affected in healthy aging,
particularly in the cerebellum. Preliminary data suggests that, with sufficient high-quality data, cortical networks
in young adults are stable across days (r > 0.85), supporting their endophenotypic nature and potential for use
as biomarkers. This study will be the first to use individualized measures in older adults to provide a better
understanding of neurodevelopmental changes to rs-FC that may be relevant to behavior. Individualized network
topology has previously been found to be predictive of behavioral and cognitive measurements, suggesting that
it may be a promising avenue to search for biomarkers of cognitive decline. My pre-doctoral work (Aim 1) will set
the benchmark for using precision fMRI with an older population to study the relationship between brain network
variability and cognitive decline. My post-doctoral goal (Aim 2) is to apply these methodologies to the study of
AD-related changes to the functional architecture of the brain and how these changes drive hallmark cognitive
symptoms. This project will also provide ample opportunities for additional scientific and professional training.
My training goals will focus on gaining theoretical and practical knowledge of defining individualized functional
networks and brain parcellations, ensuring the quality of anatomical images using FreeSurfer, and applying
special considerations to obtain reliable signal from cerebellar data. Professional development goals will center
on mentoring practices and science communication. These skills will be key to my future career as an
independent researcher dedicated to elucidating the relationship between individual differences in networks and
cognitive changes in healthy and pathological aging and fostering diversity and inclusion in academia."

Status epilepticus (SE) is a common neurologic emergency that fails to respond to first- and second-line anti-seizure medications (ASMs) in about one third of instances, thus progressing to refractory SE (RSE). Patients with RSE are at grave risk for neurological morbidity and mortality. The recently completed NIH-funded Established SE Treatment Trial (ESETT) highlights the need for improved SE therapies. In that study, >50% of people who failed to respond to the first line agent (i.e. a benzodiazepine; BDZ also failed to respond to the commonly used intravenous (i.v.) second-line agents (e.g. fosphenytoin, valproate, or levetiracetam (LEV)). An improved second-line injectable ASM, with higher likelihood to terminate SE than presently-available injectable ASMs, is thus an important unmet medical need. Of the currently available ASMs, topiramate (TPM) is an attractive medication to evaluate for seizure suppression in treatment-resistant SE given (1) its multimodal mechanism of action, (2) favorable data from parenteral administration in cases of highly resistant SE, and (3) its potential for neuroprotection. Oral and nasogastric tube TPM can ameliorate RSE and super-refractory SE (SRSE, a condition where seizures persist for more than 24 hours) where numerous other ASMs have failed. Yet, TPM is not clinically available for i.v. administration, which is the route of choice in SE treatment. We (PrevEp, Inc.) developed a novel, intellectual property-protected i.v. TPM formulation (PrevEp004) using the FDA-approved excipient meglumine, which provides excellent i.v. tolerability and enables rapid TPM administration across ages for treatment of SE/RSE. We now propose to test the PrevEp004 capacity to terminate SE/RSE. We will (1) measure the tolerability and efficacy of i.v. TPM (PrevEp004) in comparison to i.v. LEV in the rat lithium-pilocarpine model of established SE, following treatment with a BDZ to mimic a realistic clinical situation, using a randomized, blinded design with continuous video EEG monitoring of treatment outcome; (2) measure plasma and brain pharmacokinetics (PK) of the most effective dose of i.v. TPM in rats in order to determine effective drug plasma and brain concentrations to target in clinical trials; (3) further optimize the novel i.v. formulation of PrevEp004 (i.v. TPM), and establish a GMP manufacturing process for the i.v. formulation to enable clinical trial supply; (4) Evaluate the toxicity of the i.v. TPM formulation in rats by conducting a GLP compliant multiple dose toxicity study with i.v. administration of PrevEp004; and (5) prepare a pre-IND meeting with the FDA to enable clinical trials using data obtained from aims 1-4. The pilocarpine experiments and PK studies will be done by Dr. Goodkin at UVA. The pharmaceutical development will be done with Dr. Rogawski at UCD. Expected outcome: Within two years of funding we will (a) test PrevEp004 tolerability and efficacy in an etiologically realistic rat SE model; (b) develop a suitable PrevEp004 formulation and characterize its safety; and (c) conduct a pre-IND meeting to enable the future conduct of a phase I and Ila program in volunteers and SE/RSE patients as a step toward the first-in-human proof of concept (PoC) study, which will be the basis of a subsequent SBIR phase II application. Beyond the scope of this proposal, PrevEp004 may also serve as an i.v. TPM replacement that can be used in instances where patients (>2 million in US) who apply TPM for seizure or migraine management cannot tolerate enteric medication (e.g. after gastrointestinal surgery)."

This is an application for a Beeson K76 award for Dr. Matthew Growdon, a geriatrician-researcher at University
of California, San Francisco (UCSF). One-third of older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and Related
Dementias (ADRD) live alone. A critical but understudied challenge facing people with dementia (PWD) who
live alone is the safe and effective use of medications. Due to cognitive impairment, PWD are more likely to
misuse medications than those without dementia; compounding this risk, PWD who live alone are more likely
to lack support for medication management than those who live with others. Balancing potential benefits and
harms of therapy for PWD living alone is paramount. Yet, prior research on prescribing practices, supports, and
medication-related experiences for this vulnerable population is scant, impeding targeted interventions. There
is an urgent need for an evidence-informed framework for addressing medication management in PWD who
live alone to guide clinicians in prescribing decisions, support PWD who live alone, and inform interventions to
improve care. The objectives of this proposal are to characterize medication use and supports among PWD
who live alone, to understand key perspectives on their use of medications, and to develop a stakeholder-
informed clinical decision framework that will guide future interventions to optimize medication use in this
group. Mentored by an extraordinary team led by Dr. Michael Steinman at UCSF, Dr. Growdon will: 1) Evaluate
medication use and medication management supports among PWD who live alone using National Health and
Aging Trends Survey data merged with Medicare claims; 2) Conduct qualitative interviews with PWD who live
alone, their care partners, and multidisciplinary clinicians to understand medication-related experiences and
needs; and 3) Develop and refine a clinical decision framework and set of prioritized interventions attuned to
medication optimization for PWD who live alone by conducting focus groups with PWD who live alone, care
partners, and clinicians as well as a transdisciplinary expert Delphi panel informed by findings from Aims 1 and
2. These Aims dovetail with career development activities focused on: 1) Advanced pharmacoepidemiology; 2)
Rigorous qualitative research skills with socially vulnerable older adults; 3) Stakeholder engagement and
intervention development in dementia care; and 4) Leadership skills. This Beeson K76 proposal will advance
much-needed knowledge of the epidemiology and lived experiences of medication use and supports among
PWD who live alone. This knowledge will directly inform an innovative stakeholder-informed clinical decision
framework and intervention strategies to optimize medication use, forming the basis for a compelling R01
proposal to improve prescribing quality and outcomes for older adults with ADRD who live alone. It will also
provide advanced research skills and valuable data to launch Dr. Growdon's career as a leading independent
investigator improving prescribing quality for older adults with ADRD and social vulnerability."

As Americans enter the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are also in a mental health crisis. Emerging
adults in particular are experiencing a high prevalence of anxiety, depression, suicidality, and psychosis
compared to pre-pandemic levels. A slowed economy, increased social isolation, loss of typical support systems,
and financial instability abruptly hit just as emerging adults were transitioning from adolescence to adulthood,
potentially disrupting typical milestones such as leaving home, pursuing higher education, starting vocations,
and becoming financially independent. The pandemic has also underscored persistent health inequalities that
exist between White Americans and racial/ethnic minorities, due at least in part to experiences of discrimination.
Living in poverty is an additional risk factor for mental health problems, and is a vastly different experience for
White and minoritized individuals due to environmental and social factors afforded to different racial/ethnic
groups. In addition, neighborhood characteristics and community type (i.e., rural, urban) can intersect with
racial/ethnic identity to increase risk or offer protection from mental health problems. The genetically-informative
Early Steps Multisite (ESM) study of 731 racially/ethnically diverse low-income families presents a unique
opportunity to examine how a sample of at-risk emerging adults, prospectively followed since age two and now
in their early twenties, are coping within the context of the pandemic. The ESM sample was recruited at Women,
Infant, and Children centers in three geographically, socioeconomically, and racially/ethnically diverse
communities: Eugene, OR; Pittsburgh, PA; and Charlottesville, VA. Participating families were randomly
assigned to receive the Family Check-Up (FCU) intervention annually from child age 2 to 10.5, or to participate
in study assessments without intervention. Assessments continued at child ages 14, 16, and 19, including two
pandemic-related surveys focused on mental health, and participant genotyping. Recruited from diverse sites,
the ESM can examine community- and neighborhood-level effects on mental health risk and resilience.
Continuing this longitudinal study, we will assess participants at ages 22 and 24, including a clinical diagnostic
interview of depression, anxiety, and psychosis. With a wealth of prospective data on neighborhood risk,
experiences of discrimination, and mental health, we propose to examine direct, interactive, and cascading
effects on mental health outcomes. Our first aim is to investigate whether race/ethnicity and discriminatory
experiences shift the developmental trajectories of mental health, and whether protective ecological factors
mitigate these risks. Our second aim is to test genetic moderation of risk and resilience on emerging adult mental
health. Our third aim is to examine the long-term preventive effects of the FCU on mental health, in the context
of growing up in poverty, and, more recently, the pandemic, while focusing on who is able to glean the largest
benefit from this intervention. Following this emerging adult sample would provide unique data on the persistence
of intervention effects on mental health during the transition to adulthood in the context of a pandemic."

Despite overrepresentation in the end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) population, African American/Black and
Latinx/Hispanic patients are less likely to have optimal transitions to ESKD care including lower rates of a
modality associated with better clinical and quality of life benefits: home dialysis. Social risk factors are major
contributors to disparities in home dialysis utilization. Black and Hispanic patients are more likely to be
unaware of home dialysis options due to inadequate pre-ESKD care, have lower patient engagement, and
have other health-related social needs (such as housing insecurity or instability, transportation barriers, food
insecurity, limited social support, and financial toxicity), which can influence home dialysis acceptance and
receipt. Thus, interventions to address racial and ethnic disparities will require a multipronged approach to
address both care delivery and social risk factors that undermine home dialysis uptake. Our preliminary work in
a predominantly Black and Hispanic population showed the benefits of an interdisciplinary care (IDC) chronic
kidney disease (CKD) clinic, which included nurse practitioner education and care coordination, to improve
care delivery. We propose a multifaceted intervention that will include IDC and integration of a Community
Health Worker (CHW) into the CKD care process to optimize social care navigation, enhance patient
engagement, and increase home dialysis use. To evaluate the intervention, we will conduct a pilot, pragmatic,
randomized, parallel arm trial, the CHOOSE Home Trial: Community Health Workers in an Interdisciplinary
Outpatient CKD Clinic to Optimize Social Care Navigation, Patient Engagement, and Home Dialysis Utilization.
We will enroll 106 participants with advanced CKD from nephrology clinics in the Bronx, NY, a sample
composed of predominantly Black and Hispanic patients. Participants will be randomized to the CHOOSE
Home intervention (CHW + IDC) vs. control (IDC alone). Our study aims are to: 1) utilize a community-
engaged approach with input from diverse community partners to refine the CHOOSE Home Trial; and 2)
evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and possible effect of the CHOOSE Home Intervention. Feasibility and
acceptability will be evaluated using complementary quantitative and qualitative measures and organized into
the dimensions of the RE-AIM framework. We hypothesize that the CHOOSE Home intervention is feasible
and may lead to increased home dialysis utilization by more effectively addressing health-related social needs
and fostering greater patient engagement. This proposal brings together experts in CKD care, SDOH, health
equity, implementation and community-engaged research. The results will be used to inform further studies in
CKD care delivery to reduce health inequities in home dialysis use and improve the quality of life for patients
with CKD."

Young adults’ initiation and use of e-cigarettes are on the rise in the U.S. E-cigarette use produces toxicants, is
addictive, and is associated with future use of combustible tobacco products among young adults. The
situation is compounded by aggressive e-cigarette marketing, which often features flavors, models, marketing
claims, and price promotions. Evidence has shown the strong influence of tobacco marketing on the initiation
and use of tobacco products among young adults, especially young adults who are naïve to tobacco. Thus, a
timely public health response comprising more regulation on e-cigarette marketing is needed to prevent and
reduce e-cigarette uptake among this group. Although e-cigarette marketing has been pervasive and is rapidly
growing, there is a lack of studies examining the influence of e-cigarette advertisement features on young
adults’ reactions and other behavioral antecedents. The proposed project will examine the influence of four e-
cigarette advertisement features (flavors, models, marketing claims, and price promotions) among young adult
non-tobacco users (including never users and experimenters) who are susceptible to e-cigarette use. This
study will pursue two Specific Aims: Aim 1 is to identify key features of e-cigarette advertisements that lead to
greater attention, cognitive arousal, and positive emotional responses; and Aim 2 is to determine whether
edited e-cigarette advertisements without key features lead to reduced positive e-cigarette perceptions and
behavioral intentions compared to original, unaltered advertisements. The Aim 1 study will use within-subjects
design and adopt eye-tracking technology equipped with pupil diameter assessment and facial expression
analysis among 70 young adults. The Aim 2 study will adopt a between-subjects comparative randomized
experiment among 900 nationally representative young adults enrolled in an online panel. Individual
differences (e.g., biological sex and tobacco use history) in neurocognitive reactions and e-cigarette related
perceptions and behavioral intentions will also be assessed for the two studies. The proposed research will
innovatively use neuroscience technologies to objectively measure young adults’ neurocognitive reactions to e-
cigarette advertisements and help draw causal inferences between viewing e-cigarette advertisements
features and immediate perceptions and intentions of using e-cigarettes. This research is directly relevant to
the development of the FDA’s policymaking efforts to reduce the impact of e-cigarette advertisements on
potential uptake of e-cigarettes among young adults who are naïve to tobacco products."

The purpose of this K23 proposal is to facilitate Dr. Neeraj Patel’s development into an independent surgeon
scientist who will partner with communities, generate community-centered input, and design and implement
interventions to reduce inequities in pediatric sports medicine. Hundreds of thousands of youth athletes require
surgery for knee injuries annually. The incidence of operative knee injuries has skyrocketed, but surgery can
be delayed due to late recognition and barriers, such as insurance, language, and difficulty navigating the
healthcare system. Delays may have lifelong effects, including arthritis, persistent instability, poor patient
reported outcomes, and reoperation. There is little patient-centered research on barriers to orthopaedic care,
and none on interventions to reduce disparities in pediatric sports medicine. To accomplish his long-term
goals, Dr. Patel requires training in community engaged research (CEnR), qualitative methods, and
implementation science. He will achieve these training goals through a comprehensive career development
plan that includes strong mentoring, focused didactics, growing collaborations, and experiential training. This
will guide him towards national expertise in disciplines where few orthopaedic surgeons have any background.
His primary mentor is Dr. Rinad Beidas, an international leader in implementation science with extensive
record of federally funded community research and mentorship. The mentoring team also includes a diverse,
multidisciplinary group of researchers with complementary expertise: Drs. Namratha Kandula (CEnR and
intervention design), Matthew Davis (pediatric CER and population health research), and Julie Johnson
(qualitative methods). Dr. Patel’s development will be bolstered by the robust resources of Lurie Children’s
Hospital and Northwestern University. The proposed study will focus on Hispanic children, a growing
population nationally and 38% of the Chicago’s children, who are at increased risk of delayed knee surgery
and its sequelae compared to white, non-Hispanic patients. The overall objectives are to identify barriers to
timely knee surgery in Hispanic athletes and develop an intervention to implement evidence on expedient
treatment. Under the lens of the Health Equity Implementation Framework, the specific aims are to: (1) identify
barriers and facilitators to timely care of knee injuries for Hispanic high school athletes; (2) design an evidence-
based, culturally-tailored intervention for Hispanic athletes, families, and coaches to reduce delays in
evaluation of acute knee injuries via user-centered principles; and (3) evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and
appropriateness of the culturally-tailored intervention in a pilot study of Hispanic youth soccer leagues. The
proposed aims will drive creation of a future community trial of a culturally-tailored intervention, which will be
the basis for R03 and R01 funding applications. In the process, Dr. Patel will become an expert in CEnR,
qualitative methods, and implementation science, establishing him as one of the only orthopaedic surgeons
conducting health equity CER and a resource for others seeking to address orthopaedic disparities."

 Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a non-invasive, 3-dimensional imaging method to
visualize and quantify microvasculature throughout the retina. The proposed study evaluates the clinical utility
of OCTA measurements compared to standard structural measurements of the optic nerve head (ONH), retinal
nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macula measured using the current clinical imaging standard, spectral domain
optical coherence tomography (OCT) to predict and detect progression of disease in glaucoma suspects and
glaucoma patients. Our research, and that of others, has shown that superficial retinal vessel density
(proportion of measured area composed of blood vessels) in the ONH region and macula is less dense in open
angle glaucoma (OAG) eyes than in healthy eyes. Moreover, diagnostic accuracy is improved with increasing
disease severity. Research from our laboratory suggests that the diagnostic accuracy of vessel density is
similar to that of OCT-measured RNFL thickness, and that vessel density is reduced in retinal regions
associated with localized visual field (VF) defects. These cross-sectional results strongly suggest that OCTA
measurements reflect damage to tissues relevant to the pathophysiology of OAG. In a longitudinal study, the
mean rate of change in macula vessel density was shown to be significantly faster in OAG eyes than in
glaucoma suspect or healthy eyes. Finally, recent results indicate that shallow machine learning analyses of
combinations of OCTA measurements can improve classification of healthy and glaucoma eyes compared to
standard instrument measurements as can deep learning analyses of OCTA enface images. The current study
provides a unique opportunity to extend the longitudinal OCTA data that has already been collected from 480
eyes racially diverse individuals for up to 10 years to investigate vessel density change over time in healthy,
glaucoma suspect and OAG eyes, and to compare it to other imaging modalities. The aims of this study are 1)
to improve our understandingof the relative change over time of OCTA and OCT measurements in healthy and
diseased eyes to identify true disease-related change more accurately and 2) to improve our understanding of
the risk of developing glaucomatous progression using statistical and deep learning-based analyses of multi-
modal OCTA and OCT measurements. The proposed studies will enhance our understanding of age and
glaucoma-related change in vessel density and retinal tissue thickness allowing us to predict and detect
change more accurately, thus possibly slowing the rate of progression and consequently reducing the risk of
reduction of vision related quality of life, including blindness."
10973557,"Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) impacts 11-20% of Veterans, and 70-88% of Veterans with
PTSD have comorbid insomnia disorder. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the recommended
first-line treatment for insomnia disorder; however, using this approach with Veterans who have PTSD presents
challenges and treatment gains are attenuated. There is emerging evidence that the theoretical underpinning
and specific exercises of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) present a viable approach to improving
sleep when combined with evidence-based behavioral strategies. We have developed an ACT-based insomnia
treatment, called ""Acceptance and the Behavioral Changes to Treat Insomnia (ABC-I),"" which combines core
behavioral components (sleep restriction, stimulus control, sleep hygiene, relaxation) with ACT-based
techniques. Our preliminary work suggests ABC-I is highly effective for Veterans with PTSD.
Significance/Impact: Poor sleep is experienced by up to 90% of individuals with PTSD, and typically does not
resolve with PTSD treatment. Insomnia disorder is associated with a host of negative outcomes, including
increased suicidal ideation, poor health and low quality of life. The current study will address this important
clinical issue by evaluating the possible benefits of a novel treatment for insomnia disorder that is comorbid with
PTSD. The proposal is responsive to the HSR&D Cross-Cutting Priority Area of Mental Health/PTSD.
Innovation: The proposed project is innovative in several ways. It addresses a challenging issue among
Veterans - sleep disturbance in the context of PTSD. ABC-I treatment is also innovative, combining known
effective behavioral strategies with ACT, an evidence-based approach for depression and anxiety. The trial
design allows for simultaneous superiority and non-inferiority testing and will lead to rapid adoption of this new
treatment if it is effective for PTSD symptoms and non-inferior to CBT-I for sleep symptoms.
Specific Aims: The proposed study has 4 specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the benefits of ABC-I in reducing PTSD symptoms (PCL-5 score without sleep
item) among Veterans with comorbid PTSD and insomnia disorder as compared to CBT-I. Hypothesis 1: ABC-
I will result in greater reduction of PTSD symptoms compared to CBT-I at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up.
 Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the effectiveness of ABC-I in improving insomnia symptoms (ISI score) and sleep
quality (diary-based sleep efficiency, PSQI score), among Veterans with comorbid PTSD and insomnia disorder
as compared to CBT-I. Hypothesis 2, ABC-I will be non-inferior to CBT-I in improving insomnia symptoms and
sleep quality, at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up.
 Exploratory Aim 3: Determine changes in ACT-related process and outcome measures from before to after
ABC-I, including psychological flexibility, [experiential avoidance], mindfulness, value-consistent behavior,
depression, anxiety and quality of life.
 Exploratory Aim 4: Explore the potential benefits of ABC-I and CBT-I in reducing suicidal ideation among
Veterans with comorbid PTSD and insomnia disorder.
Methodology: The proposed study will address the following PICOT question: Among Veterans with comorbid
PTSD and Insomnia Disorder (population; n=200 randomized), how does ABC-I (intervention) compare to CBT-
I (comparisons) in improving insomnia, PTSD symptoms and ACT-related measures (outcomes), over a 6-month
follow-up period? The proposed analytic plan will simultaneously address superiority of ABC-I over CBT-I for
improving PTSD symptoms and non-inferiority of ABC-I compared to CBT-I for improving insomnia symptoms.
Implementation/Next Steps: The outcomes of the proposed study will be of interest to multiple stakeholders,
including local sleep medicine services and the national programs targeting sleep disorders among Veterans.
Findings will be disseminated across multiple pathways within and beyond VA."
10954134,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is on the rise globally, including among Hispanic/Latinos (H/L). Despite growing evidence
of the importance of diet in UC, few clinical trials have examined the impact of diet on inflammation–especially
among H/L. The long-term goal of our team is to develop evidence-based, personalized dietary treatments for
UC that consider individual patient-factors including cultural food preferences to improve both disease
inflammation and adherence. From our pilot data, we have evidence that cultural, native diets may help to
decrease disease inflammation compared to Western diets and that stool microbiome signatures may provide
guidance on future flares. We also have pilot data from my K23 cohort suggesting that H/L patients with UC carry
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) pathway genetic variants in enzymes that alter the imbalance of n-6 to n-3
PUFA ratios in the blood and tissues. These levels in prior studies have been associated with UC risk. The
overall objectives of this study are then to test the effect of a culturally tailored low fat (1:1 ratio of n-6 to n-3),
high fiber diet on disease remission in H/L patients with mild to moderate UC. We will also will test whether
baseline individual factors such as the stool microbiome composition and circulating blood levels of PUFAs
impact diet-mediated inflammation. The central hypothesis is that patients will have a greater likelihood of
achieving disease remission by week 8 on the culturally tailored diet than when on their usual diet. Further,
individual factors such as stool microbiome composition and PUFA blood levels will predict response to diet
therapy. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine the effect of a
culturally tailored anti-inflammatory Hispanic diet on UC inflammation; 2) Identify the stool microbiota
composition and functional metabolites underpinning the relationship between diet and UC inflammation; and 3)
Evaluate the influence of PUFA metabolism on UC inflammation. Under the first aim, we will evaluate the efficacy
of a culturally tailored, high fiber and low-fat diet using a cross-over design on 122 patients with mild to moderate
UC. Our primary outcome will be clinical and biochemical remission using the validated simple clinical colitis
index (SCCAI) and Fecal Calprotectin (FC) at week 8. Patients will receive catered meals for the diet intervention
and stipends for groceries when on placebo diet. Under the second aim, we will examine microbiota abundance
and microbiota-derived metabolites at baseline and that associate with changes occurring from the diet
intervention and among responders/non-responders to diet. The third aim examines the influence of PUFA
metabolism (including PUFA serum levels) as predictors of disease inflammation and response to diet. The
proposed research is significant because we are developing an evidence-based anti-inflammatory diet for UC
tested in a controlled clinical trial that also considers cultural foods, which is unprecedented in prior studies. Our
research is innovative because it is the first attempt to tailor dietary therapy in UC that examines individualized
predictors of response to diet."
10954200,"Building on the extensive genome wide association studies (GWAS) of coronary artery disease (CAD), and
single cell characterization of atherosclerosis, we have shown that the smooth muscle cell (SMC) lineage
harbors much of the risk for vascular disease. Further, these data indicate that SMC can assume two disease-
related transition states linked to disease risk. We identified TCF21 as a protective CAD GWAS gene and
showed that it regulates a disease-related transition of medial SMC to a fibroblast-like phenotype, producing
cells we term “fibromyocytes” (FMC). Further, we and others have found that SMC can also transition to a
second phenotype, characterized by expression of genes known for their role in endochondral bone formation
and intimal vascular calcification. We showed in mouse genetic models that this chondrogenic process, which
gives rise to cells we term “chondromyocytes” (CMC) is actively inhibited by the CAD GWAS protective Tgfb1
signaling molecules Smad3 and Zeb2, and promoted by the CAD GWAS causal factors Pdgfd and Twist1.
Further, recent transcriptomic and epigenomic (multi-omic) single cell studies indicate that FMC and CMC are
the end products of disparate trajectories that SMC differentially traverse in the disease setting. Our central
hypothesis for this work postulates that these trajectories are specified by enhancers and key
regulatory transcription factors (TFs) that mediate the branch point directionality of transition
commitment, and that these cis- and trans-acting genetic modulators underlie the fundamental
mechanisms of CAD gene causality in the SMC lineage. Algorithms that link disease variation and disease
scRNAseq data show that disease genetic risk resides in cell state changes from SMC to FMC and SMC to
CMC, making it imperative that we investigate the enhancers, related TFs, and regulons that mediate these
phenotype transitions. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will generate and analyze a time-course of single cell multi-
omic data from a mouse atherosclerosis model to map the epigenomic and transcriptomic regulatory elements
that mediate SMC transition to the FMC and CMC trajectories. We will perform similar studies with mice
targeted for CAD associated genes that promote or inhibit disease risk, to identify differences between the cis-
and trans-acting factors, and disease-related regulons that determine the disease trajectories and directionality
of disease risk. In Aim 2 we will perform multi-omic assays on human coronary lesions of varying severity to
examine the molecular mechanisms that mediate SMC transitions in human disease. Finally, in Aim 3, we will
perform in vitro enhancer PerturbSeq in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells to validate computational
results from previous Aims, and further characterize downstream targets and gene regulatory networks of
transition enhancers and TFs. The proposed studies will identify cellular and molecular mechanisms that
mediate SMC transitions to FMC and CMC, and the relationship of these transitions to vascular calcification
and disease risk."

The Virology and Molecular Biomarkers (VMB) Core (Core J) provides state-of-the-art resources to catalyze 
basic, translational, clinical, and behavioral HIV/SIV research in support of Emory CFAR’s mission. The Core 
comprises three highly collaborative units with complementary resources and expertise. The Translational 
Virology Unit (TVU), develops and implements viral quantitative assays supporting primarily nonhuman primate 
(NHP) models of AIDS pathogenesis, prevention, therapy, and cure research. The CLIA/CAP-certified Clinical 
Virology Unit (CVU), provides virologic and molecular diagnostic assays for clinical, translational, and 
behavioral studies of HIV infection, sexually transmitted infections (STI), co-infections, and related syndromes. 
The Viral Reservoirs Unit (VRU) develops and implements assays that quantify the viral reservoir on 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) to support cure research. The VMB Core provides innovative, standardized, high 
throughput viral quantitative assays, nimbly adapts to the needs of HIV/SIV researchers in an ever-evolving 
field, and serves as a resource for training early-stage investigators in molecular virologic assays. 
The Core effectively responds to the needs of an evolving field through the development, validation, and 
provision of: 1) standardized plasma viral load assays for HIV, SIV, and SHIV; 2) cell-associated DNA and 
RNA assays for SIV and HIV; 3) molecular diagnostic assays for HIV-associated co-infections (HBV, HCV, 
CMV) and STIs; 4) HIV/SIV quantitative assays in non-standard specimens; and 5) molecular assays to 
measure the viral reservoir under ART. The Core expanded its services with the addition of the VRU to support 
HIV cure research, including the establishment, maintenance, and eradication of the persistent reservoir of 
latently infected cells under ART. In the next project period, the VMB Core will further the range and overall 
performance of provided assays and services and leverage the Illumina MiSeq deep sequencing platform to 
characterize virus integration sites, viral evolution in response to new therapies, and the relationship of the 
genital/gut microbiomes with HIV transmission/pathogenesis. The Core will continue training activities in 
molecular virological techniques and gene assays, providing expert consultation, and expanding opportunities 
for stakeholder engagement through these specific aims:
Aim 1. Expand the capacity of the Translational Virology Unit to provide a greater range of assays to support 
studies of pathogenesis, prevention, and therapy of SIV/SHIV in NHPs.
Aim 2. Provide established and novel assays required for HIV human subjects research and clinical trials 
through customized clinical testing in the CLIA-certified Clinical Virology Unit.

SyImmun Core will provide an array of high-throughput multi-omic single cell profiling techniques, including 
scRNA-Seq, CITE-Seq (Cellular Indexing of Transcripts and Epitopes, which allows integration of single cell 
transcriptomic and proteomic data), and single cell ATAC-Seq, which allows single cell epigenetic analysis. 
Training will be provided to investigators on the design of flow cytometric and single cell multi-omic 
experiments, along with a suite of courses that provide introductory and intermediate level courses in analytic 
tools used for the analysis of these data sets. Bioinformatic and biostatistical support and analytic tools will also 
be provided through the Core. The Systems Immunology Core proposes the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Provide the highest quality flow cytometry data, cell sorting services, and analytic tools to Emory CFAR 
Members in support of groundbreaking Immunology research;
Aim 2: Support an array of single cell multi-omics techniques, including scRNA-Seq, CITE-Seq and ATAC-Seq 
and outstanding bioinformatic and biostatistical expertise in collaboration with the Biostatistics and 
Bioinformatics Core;
Aim 3: Train CFAR Members in the state-of-the-art design and analysis of flow cytometric and single cell multi-omic techniques. These services will provide Emory CFAR Members with unprecedented access to a wide 
range of tools in support of groundbreaking research to better understand immune function in HIV and SIV 
infection, and to further develop novel approaches to prevent and cure HIV infection."

The Clinical Research Core (CRC) (Core D) provides services to support researchers conducting human 
subjects research studies investigating the pathogenesis of HIV disease, treatment and prevention of HIV, 
strategies to eliminate HIV from those who are infected, and the reduction of the long-term morbidity among 
those with HIV infection. The Clinical Core will enable the conduct of scientifically rigorous HIV clinical and 
translational research through the provision of state-of-the-art research infrastructure including shared 
research space, laboratory services, and expert consultation in clinical research methods and study 
implementation. To support investigators engaged in these activities the Core will expand the use of a 
sophisticated clinical database, the “HIV Disease Registry” (>32,031 unique patients cared for at Emory-associated facilities, with 6,066,481 patient encounters representing over 123,972 person years of clinically 
relevant data). The CRC will provide access to a diverse array of biological specimens and data from 
populations traditionally under-represented in HIV research, including minority women, adolescents, pregnant 
women, and minority men who have sex with men. The Core’s specimen repository provides access to 
specimens and data from populations critical to high priority research questions, including elite controllers, 
long-term non-progressors, people with acute HIV infection and/or acute HCV coinfection, and high-risk sero-negative men and women. The Core will foster career development of ESI and scientists new to HIV
translational research. The CRC proposes the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1. Facilitate the conduct of groundbreaking and community-responsive HIV clinical research via state-of-the-art research infrastructure, expansion of services to advance pediatric and adolescent research, and 
collaboration with the CFAR Community Liaison Council for greater harmonization of multiple community 
advisory boards to promote greater community engagement in all aspects of clinical research. 
Aim 2. Expand the use of the HIV Disease Registry to enhance international data sharing, expand data 
collection from Grady’s pediatric and adolescent population, and add data from Emory Healthcare.
Aim 3. Provide access to data-linked biological specimens from diverse populations, including 
underrepresented groups in HIV research; renew the focus on children, adolescents, and young adults, while 
continuing to strengthen the participation of women; and expand our biobank for emerging research such as 
SARS CoV-2/HIV coinfection and vaccines.
Aim 4. Foster career development for the next generation of HIV researchers through Core services and 
programs and through collaboration with the Developmental Core."

The Prevention and Implementation Sciences (PAIS) Core (Core C) is dedicated to supporting rigorous, 
high-impact team science and accelerating the highest caliber HIV prevention, behavioral science, and 
implementation science research in support of NIH research priorities and the Ending the HIV Epidemic 
Initiative (EHE). In the current funding cycle, PAIS developed a successful service center model, launched the 
Study Management and RetenTion System (SMART) study platform, and co-developed the Planning for 
Success grant writing initiative. The PAIS Core will continue these successful initiatives and will develop new 
services to advance prevention science objectives. A goal of the Core is to provide training and support in 
implementation science to bridge implementation chasms that impede progress toward reaching the EHE 
goals. The proposed Aims expand beyond traditional sociobehavioral sciences to integrate novel technologies 
(e.g., mHealth), theoretical advancements (e.g., implementation frameworks), and web-based platforms for 
service provision. Collectively, these expansions will enhance the Core’s impact and promote the CFAR priority 
of conducting groundbreaking, transdisciplinary science.
mHealth and implementation science approaches, grounded in sociobehavioral sciences, offer promising 
avenues to achieve EHE and NIH research priorities by supporting scale-up of successful interventions. Given 
EHE’s ambitious goals, scaling-up evidence-based interventions (e.g., PrEP, HIV testing) through traditional 
physical access channels and in-person interventions will be challenging. mHealth approaches provide rapidly 
scalable solutions, and all Emory CFAR Members will benefit from the Core’s apps and survey support 
services that shorten the time from concept to funded research. Implementation Science approaches offer 
critical frameworks and methods to elucidate the determinants of implementation, and to scale-up mHealth and 
other efficacious approaches vital to achieving EHE goals. They also hold great promise for achieving health 
equity by facilitating uptake of efficacious interventions among structurally marginalized populations. A new 
training program, Collaboration for Success (CfS), will make PAIS Core services more accessible through a 
series of virtual and in-person meetings and by making datasets available to facilitate novel research and to 
strengthen grant applications. Building on the Core’s strengths in sociobehavioral science methods and in 
collaboration with CFAR Cores and SWGs, the PAIS Core will support rigorous transdisciplinary HIV research
through the following specific aims.
Aim 1. Facilitate cutting-edge technology-based HIV prevention and implementation science research.
Aim 2. Support the rigorous application of IS approaches in CFAR and NIH proposals and research.
Aim 3. Enhance access to sociobehavioral and biomedical HIV prevention research resources."

An estimated 6 million adults aged 60 and over in the United States have Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias (AD/ADRD) at a cost of $345 billion per year. Older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), an
intermediate stage between typical aging and dementia, are 3-5 times more likely to progress to AD than those
with normal cognition. Although new pharmacological interventions for dementia appear to slow disease
progression by about 6 months, they do not cure the disease or improve quality of life, and are often
contraindicated or discontinued due to significant side effects. Thus, there is a compelling need to continue
testing non-pharmacological alternatives for slowing disease progression. Late-life engagement in cognitively
challenging activities has been associated with decreased risk of cognitive decline; however, not all older
adults, particularly those with MCI, remain cognitively active. Music-based interventions (MBIs) are a promising
strategy for addressing cognitive inactivity in late-life. Group singing, in particular, is an appealing approach
because it is a multi-domain process that involves the complex interplay of numerous brain regions. Research
has shown that group singing facilitates social bonding and benefits health and cognition in community-
dwelling elders as well as in patients with dementia. However, few studies to date have investigated the effects
of group singing for older adults with MCI. Because internet-based interventions can improve quality of life and
decrease social isolation and depression in older adults, including older adults with MCI, the proposed project
will develop, refine, and test the effects of an online group singing intervention for older adults with MCI in two
phases. In Phase 1, we will develop and refine an online group singing intervention that uses the JackTripTM
Virtual Studio, a platform that provides an audio-visual setup similar to Zoom but with minimal latency delays
allow singers to achieve the “same room” experience. We will aim to test the feasibility of the MBI Toolkit
principles and affect all three Science of Behavior Change (SOBC) targets (i.e., interpersonal and social
processes, stress reactivity, and self-regulation) with the intervention. In Phase 2, we will conduct a 2-arm
randomized pilot trial to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the online group singing intervention versus
an attention control condition according to the NIH MBI Toolkit principles and guidelines. We will also examine
the feasibility of administering the assessments of the proposed SOBC targets of our online group singing
intervention. The successful completion of this study will support a subsequent, larger randomized
effectiveness trial that will rigorously evaluate our online group singing intervention versus an active attention
control as a viable intervention for MCI and other brain disorders of aging."

Dr. Daniel Shalev is an Assistant Professor of Medicine and Psychiatry at Weill Cornell with expertise in
psychiatry, palliative medicine, and behavioral geriatrics. His career goals are to 1) become a leading
investigator in mental health delivery for older adults with serious illness and thereby 2) to improve mental
health outcomes for older adults with serious illness. Research: Over 70% of deaths in the United States are
due to chronic illness. The burden of serious medical illnesses like cancer, heart failure, and chronic lung
disease falls disproportionately on older adults. As the population of older adults grows, so too will the impact
of serious chronic illnesses. The standard of care for older adults with serious illness includes geriatric
palliative care, a multidisciplinary approach to palliative care that emphasizes longitudinal care, multimorbidity,
and quality of life. Psychiatric and psychological symptoms like depression and anxiety are common among
older adults living with serious illness and have a significant impact on outcomes such as quality of life. Mental
health is a core focus of palliative care. Older adults face distinct barriers to accessing mental health care that
make them particularly likely to depend on palliative care clinicians for mental health services. However,
palliative care clinicians may face barriers to assessing and managing such symptoms leading to gaps in care.
The objective of this proposal is to adapt the Collaborative Care Model to the palliative care setting to improve
depression and anxiety care for older adults. The Collaborative Care Model integrates mental health services
into medical care that has been validated in over 90 clinical trials. The model involves embedding a social
worker and psychiatrist in a medical setting to provide direct patient care and guide medical clinicians in
improving their mental health skills and knowledge. This study will utilize the Method for Program Adaptation
through Community Engagement, an intervention adaptation method co-designed by Dr. Shalev’s primary
mentor Dr. Cary Reid, to create the Collaborative Care Model for Palliative Care (CoCM-PAL) (Aim 1) and to
conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of CoCM-PAL (Aim 2). Completion of the proposed study will
generate key pilot data for a large efficacy trial of CoCM-PAL. Career Development: Dr. Shalev has assembled
a multidisciplinary team of mentors (Primary Mentor: Dr. Cary Reid, Co-Mentors: Dr. Vicki Jackson, Dr. Jesse
Fann, and Dr. Catherine Riffin) and advisors (Dr. Harold Pincus, Dr. Kelly McConnell, Dr. Mark Lachs) with
expertise in geriatric serious illness care, geriatric mental health, and Collaborative Care. His career
development plan focuses on training in 1) behavioral intervention/design and clinical trials for older adults with
serious illness 2) integration of implementation science into early phase of intervention research, 3) clinical
care of older adults with both serious illness and mental health needs, and 4) leadership and grant writing.
This Beeson award will provide Dr. Shalev with the skills, experience, and mentorship to become a leading
investigator in mental health services for older adults with serious illness."
10974318,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Annually, traumatic injuries affect roughly 3 million people in the US and account for over $650B in costs.
Many patients are resilient and recover well emotionally, but over 20% (~600,000 people per year) develop
mental health problems such as posttraumatic stress disorder and depression, both major risk factors for social
and occupational impairment; poor physical health and quality of life; and lost productivity, work, and financial
resources. Most trauma centers do not address the mental health recovery of patients after a traumatic injury.
This gap in the quality of patient care, combined with unique barriers to mental health services that traumatic
injury patients face, necessitates a cost-effective intervention that meets the needs of these patients at each
stage of the recovery process. We will test the Trauma Resilience and Recovery Program (TRRP), a scalable,
sustainable technology-enhanced intervention to support the mental health recovery of patients who have
experienced a traumatic injury. The model includes education, risk screening, and brief intervention at the
bedside (Step 1); symptom self-monitoring and continued education via a daily text messaging system (Step
2); mental health screening at 30 days via chatbot or telephone (Step 3); and, when appropriate, mental health
treatment referrals (Step 4). Our previous work has provided strong support for the acceptability and feasibility
of TRRP: (1) 98% of patients approached at Step 1 by TRRP staff at the bedside enroll in mental health follow-
up, (2) more than 2 in 3 patients enroll in the symptom self-monitoring system (Step 2), and (3) 75% of patients
who screen positive for PTSD or depression at the 30-day call (Step 3) accept treatment referrals (Step 4).
TRRP staff has provided mental health follow-up to over 8,000 patients to date, only about 400 of whom would
have received mental health follow-up services under usual-care conditions based on the results of our needs
assessment. We are implementing TRRP in 12 trauma centers in the Carolinas, 4 of which already have fully
implemented it. This experience has informed the approach we propose to use in partnership with George
Washington University (GWU) hospital. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial with 1-year follow up of
TRRP vs. enhanced usual care with 350 patients at GWU, which serves a diverse population of ~2000
traumatic injury patients per year (15% penetrating mechanism). Engagement in mental health services and
clinical and functional outcomes will be assessed 3, 6, and 12 months post-baseline by trained interviewers
blind to study condition. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with 20 TRRP patients who have experienced
violent trauma as well as 15 African American and 15 Latinx patients who have experienced non-violent
trauma. These data will inform improvements to the TRRP model as well as the implementation process in
preparation for a future hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial with 8 trauma centers. This body of work is
critical to informing the field as it continues to move toward national standards and recommendations."
10973368,"Project Summary – Maintaining active high-fidelity replication despite a constant barrage of DNA damage or
blocks that are encountered by the replisome requires several inherent genomic protective functions. An
immediate first ‘on-the-fly’ response can be the recruitment of translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerase to
directly bypass damage that stalls a high-fidelity (HiFi) polymerase. However, this process is complex and
multidimensional and requires separate substitution events that can recruit one of several TLS polymerases,
facilitate insertion opposite the lesion and beyond, and then substitute back to the HiFi polymerase. Although
TLS polymerases have generally accurate insertions opposite cognate lesions, their fidelity opposite
undamaged DNA must be restrained to prevent downstream mutations giving rise to cancer initiation. The
kinetic and structural mechanisms for TLS insertions have been widely studied, providing a wealth of
information on lesion specificities; however, these results are primarily derived from truncated core polymerase
enzymes that lack N- and C-terminal domains important for interacting with replisome components to facilitate
TLS substitutions. Moreover, the molecular and structural mechanisms to limit downstream synthesis after
insertion by TLS polymerases are unexplored. We hypothesize that intrinsic contacts outside the active site of
TLS DNA polymerases restrict synthesis downstream of a lesion to maintain genomic fidelity. To test this
hypothesis, we will validate our preliminary data showing that specific ‘pink-trigger’ residues in TLS
polymerases sense synthesis at distinct positions past lesions to kinetically promote dissociation. Utilizing
primarily full-length human DNA polymerase enzymes, accessory factors, and stabilizing bridges, we will
characterize the substitution steps needed to bypass several cognate lesions, validating important contact
points that help recruit, synthesize past, and enable reinstatement of HiFi DNA polymerases. The proposed
research program is highly integrated using advanced biochemical, enzymological, kinetic, and structural
approaches to better understand the entire TLS process and will be performed by several excellent
undergraduate and graduate student researchers providing a significant health science training opportunity at a
primarily undergraduate university. Results from this proposal will provide a clearer understanding of the steps
and contacts required to perform efficient TLS but also restrict downstream low-fidelity synthesis past template
lesions. Conclusions from these studies will be influential in providing insights into patient mutations leading to
cancer and rapid aging as well as identifying novel targets to prevent chemoresistance."

Many minoritized populations, such as older adults from Black/African American, Latinx/a/o, and
socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, are disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's Disease and
Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRDs). Yet, these populations are chronically under-included in
research, which has serious scientific and ethical ramifications and is a priority outlined in National Strategy for
Recruitment and Participation in Alzheimer’s Disease Clinical Research. This highlights an urgent need for novel
research inclusion efforts. Therefore, the overall goal of this K01 Mentored Research Scientist Career
Development proposal is to address this critical need by providing Dr. Miriam Ashford with protected time to
obtain necessary training and research skills to become an independent scientist who develops novel theory-
driven, community-engaged initiatives to improve the inclusion of minoritized older adults into AD/ADRD
research. The short-term research goal is to develop and evaluate novel digital research inclusion efforts which
consider the intersection of ethnocultural identity (Black/African American & Latinx/a/o) and education
background (operationalized as years of education). This project will be implemented in partnership with two
existing Community Science Partnership Boards. The development of the inclusion efforts (messaging & design)
will be informed by a behavior change theory (Reasoned Action Approach). A sequential mixed-method design
will be applied as follows: In Aim 1, a quantitative cross-sectional survey will be developed and administered
among older Black/African American and Latinx/a/o adults to identify theory-based factors (based on the
Reasoned Action Approach) associated with greater intention to participate in different AD/ADRD research
settings (remote online assessment, remote blood biomarker collection, and in-clinic observational), and to
elucidate the role of intersectionality to intentions. In Aim 2, preliminary inclusion efforts will be created together
with the Community Science Partnership Boards and informed by findings from Aim 1. The acceptability of the
preliminary efforts will be iteratively evaluated and refined using qualitative focus groups with older Black/African
American and Latinx/a/o adults. In Aim 3, the efforts developed in Aim 2 will be piloted to facilitate enrollment in
two AD/ADRD studies with on-going digital recruitment: the Brain Health Registry and the Alzheimer’s Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative-4. Findings from this research will provide preliminary data for an R01 application to
evaluate the piloted digital inclusion efforts using a randomized experimental approach in Brain Health Registry,
Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, and additional AD/ADRD clinical studies. To accomplish these
Aims and Dr. Ashford’s goal of becoming an independent researcher, she will engage in the following training
supported by a multidisciplinary expert mentorship team: 1) community-engaged and intersectionality research,
2) clinical and remote culturally-informed AD/ADRD assessment, 3) communication for behavior change, 4)
mixed-methods research, and 5) professional development for research independence."

Eosinophilic inflammation is a key feature of many human pathologies, and therapeutic targeting of eosinophils
is of clinical interest, as illustrated by the new class of eosinophil-depleting drugs in development for allergic
and inflammatory diseases. The full potential and consequences of these drugs are active areas of medical
research, particularly as eosinophil depletion does not uniformly cause symptom reduction. Despite their post-
mitotic state and short circulating lifespan, eosinophils can persist for days to weeks in certain tissue
environments. Increasingly, there is evidence of a positive role of long-lived, “tissue-resident” eosinophils in
tissue structure development and maintenance that counters the historic view of eosinophils as only having
pro-inflammatory functions. Given the prevalence of eosinophilic inflammatory conditions and development of
eosinophil-depleting drugs, there is a significant need to understand 1) which factors enable eosinophil
differentiation, 2) how differentiated eosinophils interact with the surrounding tissue, and 3) what molecular
events prolong survival of an otherwise short-lived post-mitotic cell. This project will elucidate the regulation
and function of tissue-resident eosinophils at steady state and during allergic disease. We hypothesize that
eosinophils respond to pro-survival signals in the epithelial environment by engaging cell cycle machinery to
prevent apoptosis and support rapid gene expression during specialization. The three research areas will 1)
target cell cycle machinery to manipulate eosinophil specialization in mucosal tissue, 2) delineate pre- and
post-transcriptional events in eosinophil re-specialization, and 3) define and inhibit pathogenic functions of
specialized eosinophils. These studies are technically and conceptually innovative in that they use high-
sensitivity immunoassays, 3D organotypic tissue models, next-generation sequencing, and chromatin looping
technologies to expand on paradigm-shifting evidence of a dynamic, long-lasting role of eosinophils in tissue.
The technical approach is creative and designed to address eosinophil functions that are poorly understood but
central to understanding and treating eosinophilic diseases, type 2 allergic diseases, autoimmune pathologies,
and certain cancers. This research is ideally suited to the NIAID DP2 award due to its potentially transformative
effect on the understanding of granulocyte biology. The applicant is well suited to lead the proposed work given
her technical and analytical skill, research productivity, and success in creative problem-solving and
collaborative project development. The DP2 award will augment the resources accompanying her newly
independent position and allow Dr. Dunn to apply impactful new technologies to a clinically relevant but
understudied area of eosinophil biology that has broader implications for the converging fields of clinical
immunology, personalized medicine, and nuclear structure."

Exposure to household air pollution from the use of traditional energy sources is a top-ten risk factor for morbidity
and mortality worldwide. Emissions from traditional energy sources in the home create unhealthy levels of
household air pollution and the issue is pervasive. Approximately 3 billion people rely on fuels like wood,
charcoal, and kerosene to support needs such as cooking, heating, and lighting. Approximately 80% of the
population in Rwanda uses such fuels, making exposure to household air pollution the 3rd leading contributor to
the burden of disease in this country. Exposure to household air pollution is also a problem in the developed
world. Nearly 30 million Americans burn solid fuels as their primary source of heating energy.
Nearly 50 years of research on ‘cleaner’ household energy technologies has demonstrated only modest global
impact, due to a combination of economic, cultural, and technologic barriers that prevent access to and usage
of clean energy. A further limitation is that nearly all household energy interventions, to date, have focused on
replacing only a single energy source (i.e., replacing just cooking, or just lighting) with a more modern technology.
We propose to address these issues by conducting a randomized controlled trial that (1) focuses on total
household energy (2) in a country that evinces readiness for alternative forms of energy, (3) by forming a public-
private partnership to promote technological solutions that are consumer-focused and market sustainable, (4)
by investigating outcome measures that are clinically actionable and strongly linked to morbidity/mortality, and
(5) by developing project outputs that can inform policymakers with cost-benefit information. We hypothesize
that a whole-house energy intervention (replacing all primitive forms of energy within the home with cleaner,
modern forms) will produce meaningful reductions in household air pollution and health benefits in rural Rwandan
homes. The randomized controlled trial will substitute traditional forms of household energy (biomass for cooking
and kerosene for lighting) with solar power and liquefied petroleum gas stoves in rural Rwanda. Participants will
be followed for 3 years with repeated measurements of household air pollution exposure (24-hour fine particulate
matter and black carbon), energy usage, and health. Primary health endpoints will include blood pressure in
adult women and men and lung-function growth in children; secondary health endpoints include blood pressure
in children and lung-function change in adults.
The long-term goals of this research are to increase the clinical knowledge-base on the health effects on
household air pollution, to demonstrate that a whole-house energy intervention will produce meaningful
household air pollution reductions and health benefits in rural Rwandan homes, to elucidate the relationship
between fuel subsidy levels and household air pollution exposure, and to demonstrate that scalable solutions to
the household air pollution disease burden are achievable via public-private-governmental partnerships."

Many individuals living with serious psychiatric disorders – including those that span the psychosis, autism, and
anxiety spectrums – experience significant social dysfunction and disability secondary to mental illness.
Unfortunately, social impairments are generally not addressed by psychiatric medications and psychosocial
interventions for social dysfunction are often difficult to access or otherwise limited in their scope (i.e., intended
for a discrete diagnostic group) or clinical benefit. Thus, novel therapeutics capable of addressing social
dysfunction across diagnostic groups are needed but will rely on improved understanding of the neurobiological
mechanisms that underlie these impairments. Notably, social cognition – and in particular, mentalizing (i.e., the
ability to make inferences about the mental states of others) – plays an important role in functional outcomes
among individuals with mental illness. Though mentalizing has known neural underpinning in the cerebral brain
regions that comprise the mentalizing network (MN; i.e., medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, temporoparietal
junction), emerging data suggests that the posterior cerebellum (Crus II) plays a critical role in social cognitive
processing that has not been examined among individuals with serious mental illness. More specifically, the
posterior cerebellum may act as a forward controller with cerebral MN regions – which, given the accessibility of
the cerebellum for neurostimulation relative to cerebral regions of the MN, may have critical implications for
translational interventions. In this proposed project, we will develop a brain network model of dynamic
interactions between key brain regions involved in mentalizing among a transdiagnostic sample of youth and
young adults (14-30) selected specifically for prominent social dysfunction secondary to a psychiatric illness. By
investigating network models in a sample of individuals during the phase of life in which the majority of mental
illnesses emerge or escalate, we can minimize the influence of confounding factors related to more chronic
illness or long-term use of psychiatric medications. Crucially, we will also examine the extent to which cerebellar
activity and connectivity is associated with lab-based, validated measures of functional and social-cognitive
performance to better understand neural factors that may be most impactful on critical functional outcomes.
Findings from this study have notable potential to define a novel treatment target for a future translational clinical
trial studying neuromodulation of cerebellar regions most strongly associated with devastating and difficult-to-
treat social dysfunction."

Financial hardship (including financial stress, financial strain, asset depletion, and financial toxicity) is a highly
relevant construct among the 5.7 million people with a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s
disease related dementias (ADRD) and their caregiving unit. In 2022, the total lifetime cost of care for a patient
with ADRD was estimated at more than $400K with ~208K of which are borne out directly by the family of the
person with ADRD— either through out-of-pocket health expenses, long-term care expenses or from the value
of unpaid care. In addition, few families affected by ADRD have sufficient long-term care insurance or can
afford to pay out-of-pocket for long-term care services for as long as the services are needed. There are also
hidden costs incurred by families and caregivers including lost wages, terminated careers, responsibility of
paying bills and expenses for their loved one with ADRD, and declining physical and mental health for the care
provider as well as the care recipient. Yet, these economic estimates tell only part of the story; financial
hardship also includes financial stress (the anxiety or psychological distress regarding expenses), financial
strain (the objective lack of money to pay monthly bills), asset depletion (the impact on a persons’ life savings),
and financial toxicity (the cost-associated reduction in health-related quality of life). While we know that the
impact that financial hardship has on families can be astronomical, we know very little about how to quantify
these difficulties or where to focus public health efforts to lessen these effects. To address this gap, we
propose developing a new measurement system that can capture the multi-faceted aspects of financial
hardship experienced by these families. Specifically, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with family
members of people living with ADRD to identify the most impactful aspects of financial hardship. We will use
this information, along with an in-depth scoping review and input from clinical and research experts, to develop
a new case report form and new item pools. Next, we will employ a large-scale field-testing study (N=400
families of people with ADRD; a minimum of n=100 racial/ethnic minority families), to test the new item pools.
State-of-the art statistical analysis methods will be used to identify the best items for the new financial hardship
measures. This approach has the advantage of allowing the new measures to be administered as static long-
forms, static short-forms, or as dynamic computer adaptive tests (CATs) or “smart tests” where items are
selected based on a participant’s previous response. Ultimately, these new measures will advance the field by
allowing us to characterize and prioritize the different aspects of financial hardship that are impacting these
families, as well as identify those families that are at high risk for financial hardship and associated deleterious
health and financial outcomes."

Mustard gas causes severe epithelial and deep tissue injury resulting in blisters, pain, delayed wound healing, and
scarring. The complex mechanism of tissue damage following nitrogen mustard (NM) and sulfur mustard (SM)
exposure involves an initial phase of rapid damage. This phase is characterized by acute damage to epidermal
keratinocytes and to the basement membrane attaching the top layers of the skin with the underlying dermis. This
initiates a cascade of reactions including the release of inflammatory cytokines that signal for the migration of
immune cells into the skin from the circulation. The activity of tissue-infiltrating immune cells constitutes a
secondary ‘hit’ to the initial, chemical-induced burn. This culminates in prolonged skin inflammation leading to
protracted healing and scarring. In a clinical trial, we acquired skin tissue from human subjects experimentally
exposed to NM. From those studies we collected ‘omics’ data, which we have utilized to guide experimental models
and translationally relevant milestones in the development of therapeutic strategies. In preliminary studies, we
hypothesized that the skin’s response to NM would be blunted via the topical application of a persistent, stable
radical scavenger in the form of a synthetic mimetic of human eumelanin. That is, by mimicking the natural function
of melanin as a skin protective antioxidant, we would set the wound site on a path towards reparative healing.
Indeed, in studies in mice and in human skin explants, we observed that topically applied synthetic melanin particles
(SMPs) significantly increase the rate of repair. Therefore, in the UG3 phase, we will leverage our experience with
mustard and our abundant access to fresh human skin tissue, to evaluate a select group of SMPs for their ability
to mitigate the initial injury and to accelerate wound healing. The first selection criterion will be the ability of a given
SMP to prevent sub-epidermal separation (blistering) in human skin explants. The second criterion is mitigation of
keratinocyte necrosis. The third is a demonstration of inhibition of key biomarkers of epidermal damage. These
criteria, tested in human skin explants, will lead to the advancement of six candidates for in vivo evaluation in our
established NM mouse model. Here, the first criterion is a demonstration of reduced wound area size (early-stage)
and rapid re-epithelialization (late-stage). Next, a successful SMP will lead to reduced scar formation and inhibition
of hallmark skin damaging factors. This algorithm will lead to endpoint-driven prioritization and selection of two
SMPs; a lead and back-up candidate to bring forward to the next phase. In the UH3 phase, we will evaluate the
two SMPs in a NM porcine model. This model is adapted from FDA-enabling studies that includes a demonstration
of in vivo 21-day wound reduction coupled with assessment using a 15-point histology grading instrument. Studies
in this phase will involve optimization of the drug vehicle, dose and dosing schedule. This will position the lead
candidate for advancement to the final evaluation of the same model with SM exposure in collaboration with a
contract research organization (CRO). The result will be the identification of a lead Target Product Profile and a
dataset from small and large animals that are aligned with our regulatory strategy for clinical translation of the SMP."

The ability of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) to establish life-long chronic infection in most infected individuals
makes it unique among RNA viruses. The molecular properties of the HCV genome and proteins are extensively
characterized, but how they contribute to HCV persistence and immunopathogenesis remains poorly
understood. This project seeks to identify the regions of the HCV genome that evolved to evade or modulate
immunity to establish chronic infection. We isolated a rodent HCV-like virus (RHV) from a brown rat (Rattus
norvegicus), RHV-rn1 (Rn-1), to develop surrogate animal models for HCV since Rn-1 established life-long
chronic infection in rats and showed the potential for adaptation in lab mice. However, so far, Rn-1 studies have
revealed two significant limitations. First, immunocompetent mice do not develop HCV-like prolonged or
chronic infections. Second, although lab rats develop chronic infections, the lack of immunological and genetic
resources limits their usefulness. A recent study described chronic Rn-1 infection in the collaborative cross (CC)-
071 mice; however, this CC strain is more susceptible to many Flaviviruses, and its mutated IRF3 gene,
suppressed IFN signaling and T cell immunity, and diverse MHC haplotype limits its usefulness. Thus, an
informative animal model to study the mechanism underlying spontaneous chronic HCV-like infections remains
elusive and is critical for advancing this field. Finally, we identified a mouse-adapted variant Rn-2m that can
establish prolonged or chronic viremia in normal lab mice. Subsequently, we identified the parent rat isolate Rn-
2 and its infection cleared within 3-4 weeks in mice, like Rn-1 infection. We also determined that chronic Rn-2m
infection in mice leads to suppression of liver infiltrating leukocytes and virus-specific CD8 T cells, indicating
that the mechanisms underlying the persistence of Rn-2m resemble that of HCV. Thus, there is a solid rationale
for using Rn-2m as a surrogate for HCV to achieve the following two specific aims: Specific Aim 1 is to identify
the genomic regions and mutations that allow Rn-2m to establish chronic infection. Specific Aim 2 is to compare
the nature of infection and biological properties of Rn-2 and Rn-2m. We expect to identify the mutations (Aim-
1) that determine the unique biological properties of Rn-2m (Aim-2). This knowledge will gain new insights into
the mechanism of HCV immune evasion. Additionally, proposed studies are critical for the informative use of
this new animal model that develops spontaneous long-term chronic infection of a hepatotropic RNA virus."

cardiovascular disease and aging, focused on the impact of cardiovascular treatments on cognition, function,
and global quality of life in older adults. My clinical expertise as an interventional cardiologist combined with my
research training through my Master’s in Health Sciences and Clinical Research have positioned me to
accomplish this goal. I have a track record of success and independent funding for my aging research through
a GEMSSTAR award, two Pepper Center grants, and a PCORI Healthy Aging award.
Mentors and Environment: This project will be supported by a world-class mentorship team, including Dr.
Thomas Gill (Geriatrics), a global leader in randomized trials in older adults and Director of the Yale Program
on Aging (PoA) and Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC), as well as co-mentors

Mentored Research Project: Older adults with cardiovascular disease frequently cite maintenance of
cognitive function as their top health priority. Recent randomized trials have begun to investigate whether
commonly used cardiovascular treatments can modify the risk of developing cognitive impairment or dementia.
Stable ischemic heart disease is one of the most commonly treated conditions impacting older adults, with
beta-blockers & calcium channel blockers considered the two first-line anti-anginal treatments. To date, these
agents have not been adequately tested in older populations and their long-term effect on cognitive
outcomes is unknown. We will leverage existing longitudinal data from the SPRINT MIND trial as well as
prospective randomized trial data from the PCORI-sponsored LIVEBETTER trial to rigorously evaluate the
effect of these two commonly used medication classes on cognitive status over time, mild cognitive
impairment, and the incidence of dementia among older adults."
10973005,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Development is an inherently dynamic process that operates on diverse timescales. Coordinating gene
expression, cell fate determination, and tissue growth is crucial in development, but our understanding is limited.
Through genetic analyses of C. elegans temporal patterning, we have discovered a molecular clock, composed
of circadian clock orthologs, that coordinates cell fate specification to developmental pace. It accomplishes this
task by generating oscillatory patterns of transcription that exhibit highly reproducible onset phases, durations,
and amplitudes. This clock regulates the transcriptional dosage of key microRNA (miRNA) genes that program
temporal cell fate transitions during development. The experiments outlined in this proposal aim to understand
the molecular underpinnings of this clock by determining the structures of three separate complexes
(protein::protein and protein::DNA) that assemble and disassemble in a specific order to tailor dynamic miRNA
transcriptional patterns. We will then use this knowledge to engineer clock component mutations that alter
features of these dynamic interactions. We will validate how these novel mutants affect complex assembly in
vitro and how they disturb development in vivo. Specifically, we hypothesize that these tailored mutations, both
loss-of- and gain-of-function, will alter miRNA transcriptional output by disrupting specific features of oscillatory
transcription (phase, amplitude, or duration). We will quantify changes in miRNA expression in these mutants by
directly monitoring miRNA transcriptional dynamics in mutant animals using a new state-of-the-art imaging
platform. This imaging system will also enable us to directly correlate changes in transcriptional dynamics to
alterations in temporal stem cell division patterns during development. In addition, we aim to use biochemical
strategies to identify the ligands that coordinate clock transcription factors. Identifying these ligands will reveal
how miRNA expression patterns sync across tissues to organize temporal patterning. Notably, many of the
physical interactions between the clock components we aim to study in the nematode system are conserved
between the mammalian orthologs. Therefore, these studies will not only shed light on how the timing of gene
expression contributes to developmental robustness but also may illuminate how transcription is coordinated
with metabolic changes during development."

Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting has been making a revolutionary impact on building living tissues and organs.
Despite several attempts, vascularization is still an unmet problem for 3D bioprinting of scalable tissues and
organs. In spite of significant efforts reported to generate vascular networks in 3D printed tissues, the gold
standard is still the use of sacrificial inks, which has several shortcomings such as the need for extensive post-
processing efforts to remove sacrificial inks, inability to remove these inks from low aspect-ratio features (i.e.,
highly thin, long vascular networks) and the residuals remaining from inks that usually interfere with biological
function of cells inhibiting their adhesion and spread. In this project, we propose a highly novel technology
through harnessing the power of compressibility of air in yield-stress gels and unveil 3D printing of air (3DAirP),
which is an intangible ink. The process will induce open-channel network generation in yield-stress gels in a
single step, which will overcome the outstanding limitations with the use of sacrificial inks. Moreover, the
proposed 3DAirP technology will facilitate the generation of vascular channels (up to the minimum diameter of
~125 µm) at an unprecedented printing speed (i.e., >10-folds faster than 3D printing of sacrificial inks). In Specific
Aim 1, we propose to develop 3DAirP technology, which has the capability of rapidly generating open stable
channels in yield-stress gels. We will investigate the interplay among the viscoelastic properties of yield-stress
gels and governing physical forces during 3DAirP, and how such interplay will enable us to dissect the knowledge
for directly laying down the air channels to produce stable vascular networks in engineered tissues. To exemplify
the technology, we will demonstrate two unique applications including (i) a scalable vascularized bone tissue
and (ii) an atherosclerosis model on a chip, both in vitro. In Specific Aim 2, we will reconfigure the technology for
3DAirP intraoperatively that will facilitate air channel generation under surgical settings. To exemplify its utility,
we will demonstrate two unique applications including (i) intraoperative 3DAirP within bioprinted bone constructs
in critical-sized rat calvarial defects and (ii) coupling intraoperative 3DAirP with a new microsurgery technique to
rapidly induce angiogenesis and orient vascular ingrowth in rat hindlimbs. In this regard, we have formed a
complementary collaboration that merges essential domain knowledge in bioprinting, 3D printing process and
instrument development, biomaterials, vascularization, microsurgery, craniofacial surgery, biomechanics and
simulation, and bone and vascular tissue engineering with the depth necessary to propel the proposed work
towards meaningful advances that would otherwise not be possible. Successful completion of the proposed work
is anticipated to give rise to an advanced 3D printing technology for rapid generation of vascular networks
towards fabrication of scalable tissues and organs."
10972878,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Clinical disorders of fear and anxiety, including trauma- and stressor-related disorders, represent an enormous
public health burden. Unfortunately, cognitive-behavioral therapies, such as exposure therapy, that are aimed
at reducing pathological fear are vulnerable to relapse. This is particularly problematic for patients under high
levels of stress, which undermines exposure-based therapies by impairing extinction learning and promoting
fear relapse. Despite years of work elucidating the neural circuitry for extinction, the neural mechanisms
responsible for stress-induced extinction impairments remain poorly understood. In previous work on this
project, we established that stress recruits bottom-up neuromodulatory circuits that inhibit the medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain area that is critical for extinction learning. We have now shown that that
noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) are critical for stress-induced extinction impairments, such
as the immediate shock deficit. Critically, chemogenetic activation of noradrenergic LC neurons induces
basolateral amygdala (BLA) hyperexcitability, which in turn drives feed-forward inhibition of the mPFC.
Preliminary data indicate that stress-sensitive corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons in the central
nucleus of the amygdala (CEA) drive extinction learning deficits. Based on this, we propose a novel hypothesis
that CEA-CRF+ neurons drive LC-NE projections to the BLA, which results in both BLA hyperexcitability and
impaired extinction learning. We propose three specific aims to test this hypothesis using a combination of in
vivo electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and intersectional opt0genetic manipulations in male and female rats.
The first specific aim examines whether CEA-CRF+ projections to the LC are necessary and sufficient for stress-
induced increases in BLA hyperexcitability and extinction learning deficits. The second specific aim examines
explores whether noradrenergic modulation of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the BLA regulates stress-
induced hyperexcitability and extinction deficits. Lastly, the third specific aim examines whether the BLA is
critical for transducing stress-induced activation of CEA-CRF+ and LC➙BLA circuits to undermine mPFC
activity and extinction learning. The outcomes of these aims will advance a novel circuit mechanism for stress-
induced extinction impairments. Understanding this mechanism will facilitate the development of novel
pharmacotherapeutic approaches that optimally engage mPFC circuits to promote extinction learning under
stress."

We propose to implement and assess THRIVE-DM, an expansion of our existing THRIVE health-related social
needs (HRSN) screening and referral program, with the aim of maximizing the proportion of T2DM patients
with HRSN who connect to social services and use these services to address HRSN and improve their T2DM
outcomes. This will be achieved through developing, implementing, and evaluating the THRIVE-DM
intervention, which enhances THRIVE in 3 key ways: 1) a community health worker-led referral support
protocol; 2) a community-engaged and patient-centered case management working group; and 3) a data-
driven triage tool to identify patients who are well-suited for a low versus high support strategy to connect with
social services. Together these innovations aim to increase patients’ ability to receive services that mitigate or
even resolve their HRSN, while also ensuring high acceptability among both patients and social service
providers. We will conduct a hybrid type 3 implementation-effectiveness trial to assess the feasibility and
preliminary effectiveness of the THRIVE-DM intervention. The rationale underlying this proposal encompasses
two key foundations. First, it recognizes that HRSN screening and referral initiatives, while valuable, tend to
favor individuals with a stronger locus of control, greater socioeconomic resources, superior health status, and
enhanced social capital, facilitating their successful navigation of referrals and participation in subsequent
programs. Whereas, individuals who lack these advantages achieve lower levels of success. Second, it
acknowledges the challenge of effectively allocating health system-based resources to effectively implement
closed-loop HRSN service referral linkages based on individual patient characteristics. Consequently, patients
with T2DM exhibiting greater or more severe HRSN may encounter barriers to accessing social services due to
these very same social needs. Moreover, these patients may also experience difficulties in managing their
T2DM, partly as a result of these unaddressed social needs. Thus, enhanced HRSN screening and referral
protocols, complemented by community-engaged case management based on the complexity of HRSN, build
upon our existing program to facilitate more successful connections between patients and social services.
Successfully alleviating HRSN that directly affect patients' ability to manage T2DM is a mechanism by which,
at scale, we can reduce inequities in T2DM management. However, community-level interventions addressing
the root causes of HRSN must occur simultaneously to eliminate these inequities. The proposed work will pilot
the implementation of enhanced, tiered, case management HRSN screening and referral protocols for patients
with uncontrolled T2DM. We will assess the feasibility of data collection on key person-centered clinical
outcome measures to evaluate the effectiveness of this enhanced protocol in mitigating self-identified HRSN
among T2DM patients and its impact on connections with social services, and hemoglobin A1C levels."

The goal of this project is to refine our gene therapy strategy for Xeroderma Pigmentosum-Cockayne Syndrome
(XP-CS), with the ultimate aim of improving the neurological outcomes and life expectancy for this disorder. XP-
CS is a rare, inherited DNA repair disorder that is characterized by an accelerated aging phenotype and
prominent, severe neurodegenerative complications mirroring those seen in classic Cockayne syndrome (CS),
including cognitive dysfunction, brain atrophy, neurodevelopmental delays, peripheral neuropathy, brain atrophy,
and dementia. There are several genetic subtypes of XP-CS, including one associated with pathogenic variants
in the gene ERCC5 (XPG). We have found that the Xpg-/- mouse accurately recapitulates key features of the XP-
CS phenotype, including neurological features. We have also developed a first generation adeno-associated
virus (AAV) vector capable of delivering ERCC5 that shows great promise but requires further development prior
to translation into human clinical trials. Our preliminary studies using the first generation vector in the Xpg-/-
mouse point to a clear path towards optimizing this approach, including capsid optimization, promoter
optimization, delivery optimization, dose tuning, toxicity studies, and biomarker evaluations. We expect that our
proposed studies will lead to a gene therapy strategy that overcomes many of the obstacles to translation into a
Phase 1 human clinical trial. The knowledge obtained from these studies will be generalizable, and will accelerate
the development of gene therapies for other genetic subtypes of XP-CS."

 Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating, rapidly progressive gastrointestinal disease of
prematurity that affects ~10% of neonates born at < 1500 grams. The risk of NEC is highest for the most
preterm neonates, and one infant dies from NEC in the United States each day. The mortality rate for NEC
approaches 50% if surgical resection of necrotic bowel is required. Intestinal injury in NEC results from a
dysregulated cycle of unrestrained inflammation and intestinal epithelial cell damage. Despite four decades of
research, outcomes have not improved for neonates with NEC due to critical knowledge gaps in our
understanding of mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis. The studies outlined in this proposal will
characterize new signaling mechanisms regulating intestinal epithelial injury in NEC, determine how
these pathways are modulated by microbial metabolites, and use this knowledge to identify new
dietary strategies or therapeutic targets. Our laboratory found that activation of the aryl hydrocarbon
receptor (AhR) by the dietary ligand indole-3-carbinol (I3C) downregulates the expression of inflammatory
cytokines and reduces intestinal injury during experimental NEC. We will now advance our understanding of
the anti-inflammatory signaling pathways in the neonatal intestine by examining a pathway closely related to
AhR characterized by activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). In
adult murine colitis models, Nrf2 agonists attenuate intestinal injury. Similarly, our preliminary data reveal that
dietary Nrf2 agonist administration reduces inflammation in our murine model of NEC and our unique and
innovative microfluidic model incorporating patient-derived intestinal epithelial cells and microbiome. Based on
our preliminary data and the published literature, we hypothesize that intestinal epithelial injury will be (1)
exaggerated in the absence of Nrf2 signaling in intestinal epithelial cells, (2) downregulated by Nrf2 agonist
production by intestinal microbes, and (3) significantly attenuated by therapeutic agents activating the Nrf2
pathway. For these studies, we will utilize specialized genetically modified strains of mice, a humanized NEC
model, and our microfluidic model incorporating human neonatal intestinal epithelium.
 The K08 candidate is a neonatologist-scientist who has transitioned her research focus to intestinal
epithelial cell biology and host-pathogen interactions in the developing intestinal tract. Her mentor, Dr. Misty
Good, is an international expert in this field and is completely dedicated to the candidate’s success. The
extensive training plan outlined in his proposal will facilitate the achievement of her goal of leading an R01-
funded laboratory dedicated to improving the health of vulnerable neonates through research focused on
intestinal biology and the pathophysiology of NEC."

Proper transmission of visual information relies on photoreceptors forming appropriate synaptic connections
during development. Nearly all retinal diseases that lead to blindness are caused by loss of photoreceptors
connections. Thus, elucidating the molecular mechanisms that mediate proper photoreceptor connectivity may
lead to better therapies to treat patients with retinal diseases. During development, photoreceptors first synapse
selectively to horizontal cells, where the dendrites of horizontal cells synapse to cone photoreceptors and the
axon connects to rod photoreceptors. Cones and rods then synapse to their respective bipolar target. Cones
synapse to cone bipolars and rods to rod bipolars. The molecular mechanisms that guide selective wiring of the
different photoreceptors to their distinct synaptic partners remains poorly understood. Our data shows the L1 cell
adhesion molecule Neurofascin (Nfasc) is localized to the synaptic layer during development and expressed in
rods, horizontal cells, and rod bipolars. Moreover, we find disruption of Nfasc results in rod synaptic defects and
abnormal rod-driven visual responses. As Nfasc is known to mediate adhesive interactions between neurons,
we propose Nfasc is a key molecule mediating selective connectivity of rods to horizontal cells and then to rod
bipolars. In addition, we find other cell adhesion molecules that are known to work alongside Nfasc (i.e. Caspr,
Cntn1, Nrcam), to be expressed in the complementary cone pathway. Thereby, we hypothesize that restricted
expression of cell adhesion molecules mediates selective wiring of the different photoreceptors to their respective
targets. To test our hypothesis, we will mouse transgenics, in vivo genetic manipulations, and single neuron
labeling approaches to identify the key molecular interactions that guide photoreceptors to synapse selectively
to different partners. The proposed research will elucidate the adhesive molecular interactions that instruct
selective wiring of photoreceptors to horizontal cells (Aim 1) and to bipolar neurons (Aim 2). Through these
experiments, we will uncover the molecular mechanisms involved in complex wiring of neural circuits during
development. This knowledge will be necessary to develop new strategies to restore vision in those with retinal
diseases."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has the highest mortality rate of all major cancers. While
immunotherapy has revolutionized treatment for numerous cancers, such treatments for patients with
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have not been successful. Failure of the current immunotherapeutic
approaches are due to numerous features of pancreatic tumors including; poor immunogenicity and a highly
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Macrophages are considered as a focal point for
interventional studies during PDAC given that they regulate immunosuppression, promote a pro-fibrotic
microenvironment, as well as play an essential role in promoting tumor progression along local nerves. The
autonomic nervous system work in close partnership with local macrophages. Autonomic nerves stimulate
cytokine and chemokine production in macrophages that contribute to their aforementioned functions,
however, the signaling mechanisms by which nerves communicate with the immune system and coordinate the
release of tumorigenic factors are unknown. Based on our preliminary data, I hypothesize that noradrenaline
(NA) released from sympathetic nerves binds to adrenergic receptors on sympathetic nerve associated
macrophages (SAMs), which consequently support tumor progression. To study the communication between
local pancreatic nerves and immune cells, we are using ex vivo pancreatic tissue slices from human and
mouse PDAC tumors. With this technological platform, we are able to visualize nerves, macrophages, and
tumor cells with minimal disruption from their natural state. We will characterize [Ca2+]i responses in
macrophages in response to autonomic neurotransmitters, as well as use a targeted in-vivo approach in order
to determine if blocking adrenergic signaling within immune cells promotes anti-tumor responses. Combined
with our preliminary physiological data, we will use molecular approaches to further explore this crosstalk. We
expect our results to identify communication networks between macrophages, tumor cells and autonomic
nerves in the setting of PDAC perineural invasion that will prompt new therapeutic approaches for this dedaly
disease."

Geoffrey Gusoff, MD, MBA, MS is a clinician-researcher, family physician, and post-doctoral fellow in the
National Clinician Scholars Program at UCLA. Dr. Gusoff’s work integrates insights from business, clinical
care, and aging research and focuses on the impacts of participatory business models like home care
cooperatives on job quality, care quality, and access in long-term care. Severe workforce shortages and high
turnover rates among home health aides (HHAs) increasingly prevent older adults from accessing the care
they need to age in place. Studies suggest HHA shortages and turnover are largely driven by poor working
conditions, including irregular hours, low wages, and the exclusion of HHAs from workplace decisions (e.g.
patient care planning). In this landscape of high turnover and poor working conditions, home care cooperatives
– businesses designed to prioritize HHA participation in workplace decisions – have achieved higher wages,
greater patient retention, and half the turnover rates of other home care businesses according to industry data.
This data suggests the cooperative model may be associated with better worker retention, job quality, and care
quality, but empiric research is needed to investigate these potential associations and their underlying
mechanisms. This proposal will develop and deploy a survey to HHAs at cooperative and non-cooperative
home care agencies to measure the association between the cooperative model and HHA workforce outcomes
(turnover, job quality, and care quality) and evaluate potential mechanisms of that association. With the goal of
creating a marketable tool to improve the lives of HHAs and their patients across the US, the proposal will also
partner with home care cooperatives to design and pilot test a digital training product aimed at improving HHA
turnover, job quality, and care quality by deepening HHA workplace participation. To effectively complete the
proposed studies and lay the foundation for a successful career in long-term care research and entrepreneurial
innovation, Dr. Gusoff will complete needed training in survey design, geriatrics, and implementation science.
To fill critical gaps in his business training to date, he will also complete an “MBA 2.0” in cooperative
entrepreneurship, which will provide the practical skills needed to develop transformative, participatory
business models within the long-term care sector. To accomplish these research and training aims, Dr. Gusoff
will draw on a diverse mentorship team of national and international experts including Primary Research
Mentor Catherine Sarkisian (geriatrics and community partnerships), Entrepreneurial Mentor David Hammer
(Executive Director of ICA Group, the leading home care cooperative developer in the US), Ron Hays (survey
development and psychometric evaluation), Moira Inkelas (implementation science), Madeline Sterling (home

The overarching goal of our project is to understand how immune cells impact the brain during aging, with the
objective of restoring old brain function. The brain has long been considered an ‘immuno-privileged organ’.
However, emerging studies have shown that immune cells infiltrate the brain in neurodegenerative diseases
such as Alzheimer’s disease and during aging. A key remaining challenge is to understand how immune cells
impact the brain during aging and to determine how to use this knowledge to restore functionality of old brain
and treat neurodegenerative diseases? We have been performing single cell transcriptomic studies to
understand how interventions that affect inflammation and immune cell infiltration impact the function of cells in
the brain. New experiments are currently underway, with studies of mice treated with engineered checkpoint
inhibitors, anti-inflammatory cytokines, and injury stimuli, forming the initial foundations. Importantly, we have in
parallel spearheaded new spatial transcriptomics studies. This recent work has revealed an unprecedented
glimpse into how T cells impact their neighboring cells. These findings would not be possible to assess with
single cell RNA-seq experiments, as those are from dissociated cells and lose spatial information. Thus, we are
submitting this proposal for an Administrative Supplement to apply spatial transcriptomics to one cohort of mice
to explore the power of this technology to drive future studies of spatial brain aging. This work should give a
fundamental understanding of the mechanistic impact of T cell on different cell types in the brain. Knowledge
from our study should pave the way for building transformative strategies, including new immunotherapies, for
the restoration of a pristine tissue, which will be a critical step for improving brain function during aging and age-
related diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease."

health conditions are more likely to experience mobility decline and our preliminary data show they also have
decreased diet quality when compared to older non-Veterans. They further report that their reduced physical
activity and poor dietary quality are related to a lack of access to exercise facilities, poor habits, and lack of
motivation or boredom. While a multitude of interventions have attempted to address poor diet and physical
inactivity in older adult; most have utilized resource-intensive professionally led diet OR exercise interventions,
and few have focused on the unique needs of older Veterans. Peer support offers a potentially low-cost, easily
scalable approach to encourage long-term dietary and physical activity change.

percentage of underrepresented minority Veteran populations (Baltimore, MD and San Antonio, TX). We will
accomplish this through two specific aims. Aim 1: Develop a theory-driven, peer-led nutrition and exercise

the peer-led intervention, to asses reach (recruitment, retention), adoption (satisfaction, perceived utility,

10954206,"As a cure for the life-threatening hemoglobinopathy of sickle cell disease (SCD), gene therapy has immense
potential, avoiding the burdens with allogeneic transplant of finding an appropriate donor and the risk of graft
versus host disease. Collecting an adequate number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) for gene modification,
however, often requires at least 2 days and sometimes multiple cycles of leukapheresis, imposing a cost and
logistical burden. Chemotherapy conditioning prior to infusion of the modified HSCs is myeloablative with weeks
until neutrophil, lymphoid, and platelet recovery, imposing infectious and transfusion-related risks. These issues
are significant quality of life concerns in the United States, where about 100,000 people live with SCD, and are
likely to limit access to SCD gene therapy to highly experienced transplant centers. In lower and middle income
countries such as in sub-Saharan Africa, where about 236,000 babies are born each year with SCD, however,
these issues may be insurmountable barriers to SCD gene therapy implementation. This proposal aims to
address these impediments to equity of access to SCD gene therapy by evaluating a likely-to-be cost-effective
and easy method to increase HSC homing and engraftment. In the non-SCD autologous transplant setting, the
flow-through fraction after CD34+ HSC immunomagnetic selection is known to contain accessory/immune cells
associated with improved HSC homing and engraftment. We hypothesize that, in the SCD autologous transplant
setting, co-infusing with the CD34+ cells part of the CD34-negative fraction, which is normally discarded after
immunomagnetic CD34+ cell selection, will assist with HSC homing and engraftment. Using the immune and
accessory cells left over from CD34+ cell selection of SCD cord blood units and SCD plerixafor-mobilized
apheresis products, we will immunophenotype the accessory fraction and determine in vitro homing efficiency of
a product’s CD34+ cells incubated alone (control arm) and with (experimental arm) its flow through cells (Aim
1). We will also perform transplant studies in immunodeficient mice with CD34+ cells alone (control arm) and
with (experimental arm) its flow through cells to look for improvement in human cell engraftment (Aim 2).
Altogether, we believe that evaluating the effectiveness of adding back the CD34- flow through after CD34+ gene
modification may offer a cost-effective method for increasing equity of access to SCD gene therapy."

Natural environments present numerous challenges to the visual system, including the presence
of large and frequent changes in light intensity. Such changes occur when an animal moves from
sunlight into shadow, or when it shifts its gaze from a bright to a darker area in a scene (e.g., sky
versus shaded ground). These changes can occur frequently, e.g. many times per minute, and
the intensity changes can be as large as 50-100-fold. These sudden, frequent, and large changes
in light intensity present a challenge to the retina, which must transmit a reliable visual signal as
it dynamically adapts to the new intensity: this adaptation is likely to be only partial, because the
intensity is likely to change again within the next few seconds. Furthermore, adaptation
mechanisms triggered by these changes in light intensity alter the spatial and temporal integration
of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) receptive fields, which is tantamount to changing the neural code
sent to downstream brain circuits. How can reliable visual signaling be achieved when the code
is in perpetual flux? These dynamic lighting conditions differ substantially from those typically
probed in laboratory experiments, where the mean and contrast of stimuli are often held
approximately constant. The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand how naturalistic
dynamic intensity conditions impact retinal function and visual signaling. We hypothesize that by
examining retinal coding under these dynamic intensity conditions, we will learn how diverse
adaptation mechanisms work in concert across multiple cell types to provide a reliable signal to
downstream brain areas in natural environments. This work is significant because it will advance
our understanding of how the visual system copes with rapid and naturalistic changes in light
intensity. Aim 1 will determine the role of adaptation in phototransduction in shaping RGC
responses. Aim 2 will probe the contribution of RGC spike generation. And Aim 3 will determine
the impact of adaptation in intermediate circuitry, with a focus on the role of AII amacrine cells.
These mechanisms will be linked using a CNN-based framework that permits study not only of
how the individual mechanisms work, but how they interact and collectively shape RGC
responses. These aims will reveal how adaptation in distinct loci of retinal processing
(photoreceptors, interneurons and RGCs) shape the encoding of visual features in dynamic
environments. Furthermore, they will reveal how key RGC types in the primate and rodent visual
systems deal with naturalistic fluctuations in light intensity as they visually scan and move through
the environment."

 Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that predominantly affects women and
is more prevalent among non-white individuals, including those of Black, Hispanic and Asian ancestries. Disease
in SLE can target a variety of organs, including the skin, joints, kidneys, lung, brain, and cardiovascular system,
which can make diagnosis difficult. SLE is characterized by the breakdown of tolerance to nuclear antigens; thus
individuals with SLE have circulating anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs) that recognize complex antigens such as
nucleic acids, and DNA-associated or RNA-associated proteins, including histones or ribonucleoprotein (RNP)
subunits. These ANAs form nucleic acid-containing immune complexes (ICs) that are recognized by and trigger
inflammatory responses from Fc receptor (FcR)-expressing immune cells. In this way, ANA-ICs facilitate nucleic
acid internalization and delivery to endosomes where the RNA and DNA sensing Toll-like receptors (TLR) 7 and
9 reside, thereby allowing aberrant responses to autologous nucleic acids in SLE. Plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs)
abundantly express TLR7 and TLR9, and thus are key mediators of responses to nucleic acid-containing ICs by
producing large quantities of type I IFNs, crucial cytokines in SLE. While most studies have focused on how IgG
isotype ANAs contribute to SLE pathogenesis, we have discovered a critical role for IgA isotype autoantibodies
in pDC responses to nucleic acid-containing ICs in SLE. We found that most individuals with SLE have a broad
array of IgA autoantibodies to antigens to which they also have IgG. We showed that pDCs express the IgA-
binding FcαRI in addition to the IgG-binding FcγRIIa. Using an innovative in vitro system employing serum from
individuals with SLE to generate ICs with potent pDC stimulatory function, we found a novel and critical function
for IgA1 antibodies in pDC type I IFN production in response to RNA-containing RNPs. FcαR and FcγRIIa acted
synergistically to induce type I IFN production by facilitating internalization of ICs, and pDCs from individuals with
SLE had higher IC internalization and FcαRI expression than those from HCs. Thus, we have uncovered an
important role of IgA1 and FcαR in pDC responses in SLE that we will further study here. The premise of this
proposal is that IgA anti-nuclear autoantibodies are important contributors to SLE pathogenesis through
enhancement of pDC type I IFN production in response to nucleic acid-containing ICs. Here we will use primary
human samples from individuals with SLE along with novel research tools we have developed to 1) determine
the mechanisms underlying the potent synergy between IgA1 and IgG in Sm/RNP ICs, and 2) determine how
IgA autoantibodies to nucleic acid-associated antigens relate to SLE. Together these studies will lead to a better
mechanistic understanding of how IgA and IgA-producing B cells contribute to type I IFN production in SLE."

Research Component (RC) 2 includes the development and validation of novel animal models that model a
specific pain type, and/or the development and validation of novel outcome measures. Dr. Scherrer has
participated in a consensus meeting of the Preclinical Pain Research Consortium for Investigating Safety and
Efficacy (PPRECISE) Working Group, sponsored by the Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial
Translations, Innovations, Opportunities, and Networks (ACTTION), a public-private partnership with the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration. This working group was tasked with making recommendations to improve
experimental design and reporting transparency and minimize conscious and unconscious experimental bias to
increase scientific rigor, reproducibility, and translatability in the pain field. Based on the conclusions of this
working group, we propose to develop and validate three novel outcome measures that bring innovative, state-
of-the-art machine learning, optical recording of neural activity in behaving mice, and analytic methods from the
systems neuroscience field into the field of pain drug discovery. These novel outcome measures will be used in
RC5 in vivo efficacy studies to elevate the scientific rigor and translatability of our antinociceptive NTSR1 asset
discoveries. In Aim 1, we implement machine learning–based outcome measures to standardize and automate
in vivo efficacy studies of NTSR1 assets. Manual scoring of rodent nocifensive behaviors by humans is inherently
subjective and varies considerably between experimenters, weakening data robustness and leading to
reproducibility issues. Another limitation of manual scoring is the low throughput of the method. We will develop
and validate the use of DeepEthogram, a machine learning pipeline for supervised behavior classification from
raw pixels, to reproducibly and automatically score reflexive and affective-motivational pain behaviors to evaluate
the antinociceptive efficacy of drugs. In Aim 2, we develop Ca2+ imaging methods to simultaneously test the
effect of NTSR1 assets on pain behaviors and on amygdalar activity. Because a number of factors can contribute
to reducing nocifensive motor responses following administration of an asset, relying exclusively on behavioral
outcome measures in rodent efficacy studies may not suffice to predict translatability. Here, we will develop and
validate methods to use the miniature microscope (miniscope) technology and express the Ca2+ indicator
GCaMP8f in NTSR1-expressing amygdalar neurons to simultaneously record both the activity of these neurons
and pain behaviors in response to antinociceptive drugs. In Aim 3, to further test the effect of NTSR1 assets
against pain experience, we will develop and validate the use of the “Crystal Skull” technology to image the effect
of antinociceptive drugs on pain representation in neocortex, including areas implicated in the sensory-
discriminative and affective-motivational aspects of pain, such as the primary somatosensory cortex and
cingulate cortex."

Research Component (RC) 3 includes the 1) development of new in vitro and/or ex vivo assays, and 2) screening
and/or rational design efforts to identify and characterize novel assets for pain conditions/disorders. Our team
has already established binding as well as G protein and arrestin signaling in vitro assays to comprehensively
profile NTSR1 ligands, including ligands with complex allosteric modulator activities such as SBI-553. Here we
propose to 1) develop a novel ex vivo assay enabling electrophysiological recording of NTSR1 ligand modulation
of NTSR1-expressing amygdalar neuron excitability in brain slices (Aim 1), and 2) perform an ultra-large-scale
computational screen and structure-guided early optimization of NTSR1 assets (Aim 2). For Aim 1, we will cross
mice in which expression of the DNA recombinase Cre is driven by the prompter of the Ntsr1 gene (Ntsr1Cre
mice) with Ai14 reporter mice to generate Ntsr1Cre::Ai14 mice, in which NTSR1-expressing neurons are labeled
with the red fluorescent protein tdTomato. We will then slice the brains and perform whole-cell patch-clamp
recordings, in both voltage- and current-clamp modes, on visually identified fluorescent neurons, to record
standard parameters of neuronal excitability (e.g., membrane potential, rheobase, action potential firing
frequency), as in our previous studies, in this case focusing on amygdalar neurons. For Aim 2, we develop an
ultra-large-scale computational screen and structure-guided early optimization of NTSR1 assets. We will dock a
library of 5 billion make-on-demand molecules against the NTSR1 allosteric site, seeking novel chemotypes with
the best possible physical properties (e.g., cLogP <3.5, molecular weight <350). High-ranking molecules will be
synthesized and tested in vitro. In addition, we will perform directed medicinal chemistry at the allosteric site to
optimize signaling selectivity, potency, and pharmacokinetic properties, both for SBI-553 itself, and new
chemotypes emerging from the large-library docking studies. SBI-553 analogs will be profiled in vitro using our
(Roth) TRUPATH bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) platform, which enables an unbiased
interrogation of individual G protein subunit combinations and arrestins at individual GPCRs like NTSR1, as we
have shown recently (Krumm et al., Biochemistry, 2023). Active molecules are optimized for affinity, signaling
selectivity, and physical properties in a structure-based approach. Multiple previous studies by our team
(Shoichet, Roth, Scherrer) have employed this approach to optimize GPCR ligands (e.g., Manglik et al., Nature,
2016; Alon et al., Nature, 2021; Fink et al., Science, 2022; Kaplan et al., Nature, 2022). This ample experience,
combined with the characteristics of the NTSR1 site, make us optimistic about prospects for success."

Research Component (RC) 4 includes the development of pharmacodynamic (PD) markers that indicate the
molecular target engagement of the pain assets, typically representing engagement of a molecular component
in the pathway mediating the biological effects of therapeutic target modulation, such as receptor occupancy or
gene transcription. Our major goals here in RC4 are to develop pre-clinical PD markers to test target engagement
by the novel NTSR1 asset generated in RC3 and tested for in vivo efficacy in RC5, and to develop a PD marker
that will also be suitable to measure NTSR1 occupancy in the human brain. GPCRs, including our target NTSR1,
typically undergo internalization following activation and signaling. In Aim 1, we will take advantage of a novel
Ntsr1Venus knockin mouse published very recently to develop an NTSR1 internalization PD assay for profiling, in
NTSR1-expressing amygdalar neurons, the activation of NTSR1 by the new asset developed in RC3. Noxious
stimuli induce activation of neurons throughout CNS pain circuits to generate pain perception, including its
affective-motivational dimension. In Aim 2, we therefore develop a transformative unbiased PD assay based on
the inhibition of c-fos transcription that combines mouse genetics, whole-brain tissue clearing, and light-sheet
microscopy to mark, in thousands to millions of individual neurons throughout the brain, the antinociceptive
activity of new pain assets, such as the NTSR1 asset generated in RC3. A third goal of RC4 is to develop a PD
marker to track binding of our novel asset to NTSR1 in the CNS in real time through positron emission
tomography (PET). Although other PET imaging assets have been reported for NTSR1, these agents are
antagonists and/or do not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Instead, a brain-penetrant radioactive close analog
of the NTSR1 allosteric modulator SBI-553 is desired for the present project to reflect the pharmacodynamics
and pharmacokinetics of the agent that we use in other RCs. Our team has extensive experience with developing
NTSR1-targeted PET agents. In Aim 3, we synthetize and validate a radiolabeled SBI-553 analog to evaluate
CNS NTSR1 occupancy in rodents and humans. For Aim 1, we will use a novel Ntsr1Venus knockin mouse that
expresses an NTSR1 receptor with the Venus fluorescent protein attached to its C-terminus. We will develop a
PD marker to quantify target engagement based on NTSR1 internalization in amygdalar neurons following
systemic administration of NTSR1 assets. For Aim 2, will develop a PD marker that quantifies the inhibition of
noxious stimulus–induced c-fos transcription throughout the brain following systemically administered NTSR1
assets, using mouse genetics, tissue-clearing, and light-sheet microscopy techniques. For Aim 3, two medicinal
chemistry approaches, one using 11C isotopic labeling and the other focused on 18F, will be pursued to generate
radiolabeled SBI-553 analogs. Small-animal PET imaging of the new NTSR1 targeting agent will be performed
in C57BL6/J mice and NTSR1 KO mice to evaluate in vivo specificity, pharmacokinetics of radiolabeled analogs,
and BBB permeability."

Increased risks of chronic illnesses, including Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD), have
been linked to exposures to ambient air pollution, particularly fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Despite the
observed epidemiological evidence, central and unsolved questions remain on what components of PM2.5 (e.g.,
sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, elemental carbon, organic carbon, metals, etc.) are most neurotoxic and how they
contribute to the observed risk of developing AD/ADRD. A better understanding of the specific exposure
components and underlying causal biological mechanisms and pathways revealing the link between PM2.5
toxicants and AD/ADRD will provide valuable insight into disease etiology and pathophysiology and inform
environmental regulation and health policy to reduce disease burden of AD/ADRD. Although omics
applications in environmental health research are still nascent, several studies conducted by our team and
others demonstrate that various single omics approaches, including epigenomics, proteomics, and
metabolomics can be used to sensitively map internal biological perturbations following exposures to PM2.5.
We propose deeper molecular profiling to investigate the molecular connections underlying the neurotoxicity of
individual PM2.5 pollutants and mixtures using high resolution spatio-temporal modeling of PM2.5 components as
well as targeted and untargeted profiling of PM2.5 toxicants in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain tissue.
The body’s biological response to these toxicants will be determined by measuring perturbations in DNA
methylation, proteins, and metabolites in the same tissues. Our study will be based on three well-
characterized, diverse cohorts with comprehensive assessment of AD/ADRD and related indicators and
biomarkers. Participants come from two longitudinal cohort studies prospectively followed at biennial clinical
visits and a brain bank from the same study area. They span a wide range of age and cognitive status and
reflect the racial diversity of Georgia (i.e., 32% African American). Replication of significant findings will be
done in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We will 1) characterize individual exposures
to chemical and metal components of PM2.5 and determine their impact on AD/ADRD risk; 2) elucidate patterns
of biological perturbations in single- and multi-omics signatures of the brain associated with PM2.5 toxicants
(modelled individually and as mixtures) and how they manifest in CSF and blood of individuals with versus
without AD/ADRD; and 3) determine the relative contribution of environmental and genetic factors to AD/ADRD
risk. This study provides a critical opportunity to address research gaps in molecular mechanisms underlying
PM2.5 toxicants neurotoxicity and their role in the development of AD/ADRD, supporting future efforts that aim
to inform environmental regulation and health policy to mitigate air pollution-related risk for AD/ADRD.
Moreover, it provides a critical opportunity to enrich deeply phenotyped AD/ADRD cohorts with state-of-the-art
exposure assessment and omics profiling to understand the environmental impact on AD/ADRD."

Protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is tightly regulated by an intricate network of finely tuned cellular pathways.
Among the pathways required for responding to internal or external cellular insults is the Integrated Stress
Response, which halts general protein production while specifically increasing production of a select subset of
“pro-survival” proteins. As we age, our cells decline in their ability to maintain proteostasis, serving as a hallmark
for a range of age-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, and amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis. This pathological loss of proteostasis correlates with increases in ISR activity, establishing the
importance of gaining a detailed understanding of the mechanisms involved in ISR activation. Four kinases serve
as upstream triggers of the ISR. Each kinase is activated by distinct forms of cellular stress, but all convergently
phosphorylate the eIF2α translation complex to activate the ISR pathway. One of these kinases, Heme-
Regulated Inhibitor (HRI), was recently shown to signal mitochondrial stress to the ISR via a protein called
DELE1. The HRI kinase is the principal mediator of ISR activation in neurons with perturbed proteostasis, and
is thus of particular relevance to age-related brain diseases. However, the detailed mechanism through which
DELE1 activates this kinase to relay mitochondrial stress to the ISR is unknown. Recent structural and cellular
studies on the DELE1 protein from our group have shown that that ISR activation is dependent on oligomerization
of DELE1 in the cytosol. Our high-resolution single particle cryo-EM structure of DELE1, combined with
biochemical and cellular studies, indicate that the higher-order assembly likely serves as a structural scaffold for
HRI binding and activation. We plan to elucidate how interactions between DELE1, HRI, and eIF2α transduce
mitochondrial stress to ISR activity using single-particle cryo-EM, crystallographic, and functional studies.
Atomic-level descriptions of the interacting elements of this pathway could enable us to precisely counter human
mitochondrial pathologies without impacting the capacity of cells to respond to other stresses, such as ER stress
or viral infections. We will use a range of complementary methodologies to probe the mechanistic underpinnings
of the DELE1-HRI-eIF2α pathway to gain much-needed insights into this branch of ISR activation. We will
combine biophysical, biochemical, structural, and cellular studies in three Aims that: 1) tests our hypothesis that
DELE1 oligomerization leads to auto- or trans-phosphorylation of bound HRI kinases; 2) defines the role of
cleavage in DELE1 oligomerization and ISR activation; and 3) examine the structural details of eIF2α recruitment
to HRI and the mechanism of its activation. These studies will provide a comprehensive, mechanistic description
of the key interactions that relay mitochondrial stress to the ISR, and will provide novel avenues to specifically
target the DELE1-HRI-eIF2α pathway to tune both the mitochondrial signaling and the adaptive ISR signaling
for therapeutic interventions."

Oxidative stress is associated with reduced left ventricular (LV) function and correlates with the severity of heart
failure in patients. We have recently demonstrated that Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) becomes
reversibly oxidized and inactivated in pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and that PTP1B
inactivation causes profound changes in thyroid hormone responsiveness. We showed that inhibiting the
synthesis of triiodothyronine (T3) rescued the exacerbated pressure overload-induced hypertrophy and improved
myocardial contractility and systolic function in cardiomyocyte-specific PTP1B knockout mice (PTP1B cKO). We
hypothesize that as hypertrophy develops, the inhibition of the cardioprotective activity of PTP1B by cellular
oxidants leads to T3-mediated changes contributing to pathological hypertrophy. Based on our recently
published data in which we demonstrate that breaking the interaction between 14-3-3ζ and PTP1B prevents its
inactivation in vivo, we also hypothesize that ectopic expression of a peptide derived from PTP1B, will both
prevent the oxidation and inactivation of PTP1B in myocytes, and prevent pathological thyroid hormone
signaling, left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure. We propose the following specific aims to test this
hypothesis.1) Determine the molecular mechanisms controlling PTP1B oxidation and downstream thyroid
hormone signaling in cardiac hypertrophy. 2) Investigate the potential therapeutic and anti-hypertrophic effects
of a novel PTP1B peptide that destabilizes the oxidized form of PTP1B and increases its catalytic activity in vivo.
Understanding how PTP1B regulates thyroid hormone-mediated hypertrophy will provide critical insight into
molecular mechanisms involved in cardiac hypertrophy and lead to novel strategies of therapeutic intervention
in heart failure."
10978190,"Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) affect the development of the nervous system, leading to abnormal 
brain function which may affect emotion and self-control. Obesity is an important co-morbidity of NDDs and 
are thought to arise from the impairment of important feeding-relevant circuits. Early life stress (ELS) can 
remodel feeding relevant circuits and contribute to obesity, yet the underlying mechanisms driving these 
changes are unknown. The current project aims to provide a link between early life stress and obesity. Our 
preliminary data show that in adult rodents, chemogenetic inhibition of neurotensin-expressing neurons in 
the lateral septum (LSNTS) increases standard chow intake. When exposed to HFD, silencing of LSNTS 
neurons increase HFD intake and accelerates obesity. Interestingly, LSNTS neurons respond to stressful but 
also to rewarding stimuli (i.e. HFD) and are key to the brain circuitry regulating feeding behavior. 
Additionally, ELS has been shown to alter neuronal activity in the LS and affect motivated behaviors, such 
as social interaction. We will extend these preliminary data to test the hypothesis that ELS reprograms 
LSNTS neurons activity downregulating important molecular pathways, ultimately impacting feeding 
behavior. In Aim 1, we will employ in vivo calcium imaging to monitor changes in the activity of LSNTS 
neurons to better understand how ELS alters LSNTS neuronal encoding of rewarding information and how 
these changes impact binge eating behavior and HFD consumption. In Aim 2, we will use cell type-specific 
molecular profiling (viralTRAP) and next-generation sequencing to molecularly profile LSNTS neurons in ELS 
and control mice to assess which specific gene transcripts are altered by ELS. Together, our study will 
clarify how ELS contributes to obesity by affecting feeding-relevant specific circuits in the brain. The project 
will benefit from the CNDD cores for behavioral assays, in vivo imaging, bioinformatics approaches, and 
advanced biostatistical consulting. The career development and mentorship will help the PI obtain future 
NIH R01 funding to facilitate the transition to an established investigator in the field of 
neurodevelopment and its disorders."

Cancer radiation therapy generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause both single and double-strand
DNA breaks that rapidly recruit and activate Poly ADP-ribose polymerase 1 and 2 (PARP1&2). Dual-specificity
inhibitors for PARP1 and 2 (PARPi) are promising treatments for BRCA1 or 2-deficient cancers, alone or in
combination with radiation. Progressive fatigue, a common side effect of radiation therapy, is often associated
with anemia. Severe anemia and the related therapy-induced MDS/AML are also the most common dose-limiting
toxicity of PARPi, causing the FDA to withdraw two PARPi from maintenance therapy in 2022. But why radiation
and PARPi preferentially target erythropoiesis than other genotoxic therapies (e.g., cisplatin or nucleoside
analogs) remains elusive. A major clinical challenge for combination therapy is minimizing bone marrow toxicity.
Active PARP1&2 uses NAD+ as a substrate to covalent link ADP-ribose (ADPr) to themselves and other proteins
to generate Poly-ADPr (PAR) chains. While all negatively charged, PAR can come in many different flavors.
PARP1 and 2 can ribosylate substrate proteins on different residues - Serine, Glutamine, and Aspartate. PAR
chains can be short (a few ADP-riboses) or long, straight, or branched. Histone PARylation Factor 1 (HPF1) is
a newly discovered PARP1&2 regulator. HPF1 is essential for initiating serine PARylation by PARP1&2 and
suppresses PAR chain elongation. Alteration in the PAR chain structure and organization could affect some but
not other PAR-binding proteins (readers), leading to different biological impacts. In preliminary studies, we
showed that 1) PARPi-induced acute hematological toxicity requires the presence of PARP1 protein; 2) HPF1 is
critical for both PARP1 and PARP2 auto-PARylation during normal replication and in DNA damage response; 3)
Yet, HPF1 is dispensable for hematopoiesis and murine development. 4) Hpf1/Parp1 double knockout (DKO)
mice have no measurable development defects. 5) But, Hpf1/Parp2 DKO mice with Parp1 expression died
embryonically with severe anemia. Based on these and other data, we hypothesize that HPF1 might be a
promising target for cancer therapy by balancing DNA damage response vs. normal hematological
function. We further hypothesize that HPF1 cooperates with PARP2 to regulate PARP1 activation and
dynamics during normal hematopoiesis with implications in radiation and PARPi-induced bone marrow
toxicity. To test this, we propose to determine 1) how Hpf1 and Parp2 collaborate to regulate Parp1 dynamics
at damage sites; 2) how HPF1 regulates the substrate and PAR chain structural specificity upon DNA damage;
3) how HPF1 deletion or inactivation (E284A) causes hematopoietic failure by increasing PARP1 protein
accumulation. The results will uncover previously unrecognized structural functions of Hpf1 in radiation and
PARPi-induced hematological toxicity, address the substrate and PAR chain specificity of PARP1 activation
during normal replication, radiation, and cancer therapy, and eventually provide the strategy to mitigate the
hematological toxicity."

10974012,"Neurodegenerative diseases, including glaucoma, substantially alter quality of life of our affected Veterans.
Glaucoma remains a leading cause of irreversible blindness. Currently affecting over 60 million individuals
worldwide, this insidious age-dependent optic neuropathy is characterized by a gradual loss of retinal ganglion
cell (RGC) neurons and is projected to impact nearly 112 million people within 20 years. The global prevalence
of glaucoma for population aged 40-80 years is an alarming 3.5%. An elevated prevalence among our aging
Veteran population is no exception. Implications for the US health care system are equally daunting, with an
estimated 7.3 million Americans expected to be debilitated by primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), the most
common form of glaucoma, within 30 years. Despite being an extraordinarily significant socioeconomic burden,
the treatment of US Veterans with glaucoma remains limited and palliative.
Several multicenter studies have identified elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) as a primary risk factor for the
onset and progression of POAG. While the pathophysiology leading to elevated IOP in affected patients remains
poorly understood, several new therapeutic strategies that address this concern appear promising. Of
significance, however, is the fact that up to one-third of POAG patients exhibit IOP levels within the normal range.
While many laboratories, including our own, have focused on the development and advancement of novel
therapeutic strategies for the management of IOP, a critical review of the literature reveals a paucity of
experimental studies addressing the mechanistic cause of normal-tension glaucoma. The development of
targeted therapeutic strategies directed at the cause of normal tension glaucoma is critical for the advanced
management of these affected Veterans.
In this BLR&D Merit Review validation pilot project, we propose to advance our current on-going BLR&D-funded
studies by determining the effect of pressure gradient differentials across the lamina cribrosa on optic nerve
head and retinal morphometrics and on RGC neuronal function using guinea pigs as a novel anatomically-
relevant animal model of human optic neuropathic disorders. The design of this validation study will closely follow
that detailed in Ostrin and Wildsoet (2016) and Yang et al. (2014) using a lumbar-peritoneal CSF shunt to
modulate CSF pressure.
Hypothesis: Chronic reduction of cerebrospinal fluid pressure in guinea pigs will elicit quantifiable changes in
optic nerve head morphometry and alter RGC neuronal function. The hypothesis of this study will be tested with
the following two Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 will determine, in vivo, time-dependent effects of cerebrospinal
fluid pressure reduction on RGC neuronal function in guinea pigs as quantified by pattern electroretinography.
Specific Aim 2 will determine the time-dependent effects of cerebrospinal fluid pressure reduction on optic nerve
head and retinal morphometrics in guinea pigs as quantified by histological, immunohistochemical, and electron
micrographic analyses.
The goal of this study is to (i) validate in accordance with the RFA BX-20-042 and (ii) extend the findings of
Ostrin and Wildsoet (2016) and Yang et al. (2014) on the applicability of guinea pigs as a relevant clinically useful
model of human optic neuropathic disorders. Novel findings produced by this study will determine the role
pressure gradient differential across the lamina cribrosa play in the development of human optic neuropathies."
10973371,"1. Project Summary
De novo and ultra-rare copy-number variants (CNVs) often underlie the genetic etiology of pediatric and
neurodevelopmental diseases. As such, CNVs provide opportunities to study critical dosage sensitive genes, as
well timing and origin of structural variation formation (SV). SV results from distinct mutational mechanisms,
including DNA recombination, replication, and repair-associated processes, each leaving specific genomic scars
and identifiable signatures that can be accessed with appropriate sequencing methodologies. We and others
have shown that DNA repair mechanisms, such as break-induced replication (BIR) and microhomology-mediated
break-induced replication (MMBIR), largely contribute to germline SV formation in genomic disorders as well as
somatic events in cancer. The error-prone nature of BIR/MMBIR may lead to SVs characterized as complex
genomic rearrangements (CGRs) due to insertions of templated segments at the junctions as well as
amplification or deletion of genomic segments concomitantly with inversion formation. Our preliminary data
indicate that BIR and MMBIR are prone to occur in genomic regions laden with large repeats, here called highly‐
similar intrachromosomal repeats (HSIRs), often leading to nonrecurrent CNVs that perturb nearby dosage
sensitive genes. At least 70 genetic syndromes are known to be caused by nonrecurrent CNVs, but the
contribution of HSIRs to the underlying molecular mechanism has not been established. We hypothesize that
i) a relevant fraction of de novo nonrecurrent CNVs are generated by BIR on which HSIRs provide
substrate for ectopic recombination and template-switching; ii) inverted and direct HSIRs have distinct
roles in the formation of such CNVs; iii) genetic diseases caused by nonrecurrent CNVs present highly
diverse genomic structure that contributes to variability in gene and disease expression. These
hypotheses will be tested by virtue of the following aims: (1) to identify nonrecurrent CNVs in disease cohorts
and to investigate the features of repeats at the breakpoint junctions (Aim 1); (2) to investigate whether the
genomic structure of pathogenic CNVs at the Xq28 locus contributes to allele-specific phenotypic differences;
(3) to define the impact of the genomic structure of pathogenic CNVs to an individual transcriptome with
implication for disease expression (Aim 3). In all, we will combine extensive genomic and transcriptomic analysis
with robust phenotypic characterization to investigate the molecular properties of pathogenic HSIR-mediated
CNVs. This work will fill an important gap in knowledge concerning the role of genomic repeats
underlying the formation of SVs. Of particular interest is the establishment of the relative impact of HSIRs
on the generation of CGRs. Moreover, we will establish the clinical and biological relevance of HSIR-
mediated nonrecurrent CNVs for disease expression. In summary, this application will strongly impact our
understanding of human biological processes and disease mechanisms with broad implications for the diagnosis
of birth defects, neurodevelopment, and cancer."
10974463,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Dr. Caitlyn Katzelnick has been working with investigators in the National Center for Spinal
Cord Injury (SCI) and Immobilizing Conditions at the VA Medical Center, Bronx, NY for eight
years as a senior research coordinator. Along with her Primary Mentor, Dr. Wecht, Caitlyn has
been studying the effects of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and cognitive dysfunction post SCI,
and the results of her Doctoral dissertation suggest that increased arterial stiffness in
individuals with SCI may relate to the degree of decentralized sympathetic cardiovascular
control and increased reliance on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) for
maintenance of orthostatic blood pressure (BP). Recent evidence indicates that increased
arterial stiffness is an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease risk, which may
contribute to the heightened cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the SCI, compared to the
general population. Increased reliance on the RAAS is believed to mitigate orthostatic falls in
BP and reduce the severity of symptoms reporting; however, findings in the general population
link the RAAS with vascular restructuring and remodeling. Therefore, clinical intervention to
stabilize and normalize BP should be a priority in hypotensive individuals with SCI. Advances in
methods of neuromodulation of the spinal processes offer a non-pharmacologic approach to
restore endogenous autonomic cardiovascular control and improve orthostatic BP control.
Based on our present understanding of the somatovisceral integration within the spinal cord, it
is plausible that transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (TSCS) can be targeted to excite and
modulate appropriate spinal autonomic circuitry to rapidly normalize orthostatic BP; however,
electrode placement and stimulation parameter mapping is needed to optimize orthostatic BP
control. Therefore, our primary aim is to identify an individualized map using noninvasive
TSCS of the spinal autonomic circuitry that results in an increase of seated BP. Our secondary
aim is to compare BP, plasma concentrations of norepinephrine, renin and aldosterone during a
head-up tilt with and without optimal TSCS. This investigation will be completed at the brand-
new Center of Spinal Stimulation, located at the Kessler Foundation, which is home to our VA
satellite center. Dr. Katzelnick will have access to all the necessary facilities and equipment
including: TSCS, electromyography (EMG) and cardiovascular. The CDA-1 will provide Dr.
Katzelnick with the advanced skill training, clinical research experience, and mentorship to
facilitate her growth into an independent VA investigator. Training objectives include: 1)
administering and mapping TSCS; 2) gaining an understanding of EMG recordings and
analysis; and 3) assaying the RAAS hormones. Dr. Katzelnick will take academic courses to
advance her knowledge base in grant writing, cardiovascular physiology, statistics, biophysics
and EMG. Her mentors encompass various relevant scientific backgrounds, which converge with
a similar understanding of secondary consequences after a SCI. It is anticipated that these data
will begin to establish a standard methodology for TSCS mapping of spinal autonomic circuits to
promote restoration of cardiovascular health, and overall well-being in Veterans with
immobilizing conditions. Standardized TSCS methodology will be used in future grant
applications, including a CDA-2 application, to promote improved vitality and quality of life in
Veterans with SCI."

The National Human Genome Research Institute’s 2020 strategic vision charts a path toward an audacious
goal – that in 10 years genomic medicine will simply be medicine. Today, though, genomic medicine is neither
routine nor equitably distributed. Contributing factors include lack of structured genomic data in the electronic
health record (EHR) to facilitate point-of-care decision support, limited portability of genomic data across health
systems, and inadequate access to genomic medicine expertise in rural and other underserved communities.
We propose to address these challenges as a Clinical Site in the Genomic-Enabled Learning Health System
(gLHS) Network. We will use implementation science methods and learning health system (LHS) principles to
generate genomic medicine resources that can be implemented effectively across diverse healthcare settings.
Geisinger is an established LHS and recognized leader in genomics, with the world’s largest biobank-based
genomic screening program. Geisinger provides care in all medical specialties across the lifespan to a largely
rural, socioeconomically diverse patient population. Our LHS is enabled by a robust research, innovation and
data infrastructure. Further, our investigator team includes national leaders in genomic medicine, experts in
genomic and clinical data science, implementation science, health communication, and decision science, and
representatives from community health systems that differ from Geisinger in key characteristics. In Year 1 of
the gLHS Network we will collaborate with the Network to identify genomic medicine interventions that aim to
have significant population health impact: 1) genomic screening in primary care for clinically actionable disease
risk; 2) EHR-integrated implementation of PGx for patients age 50+ on multiple medications; and 3) EHR-
integrated clinician- and patient-facing clinical decision support for managing hereditary cancer risk. In Years 2-
4 we will implement and evaluate the genomic medicine interventions selected by the Network. We will use the
Conceptual Model of Implementation Research (CMIR) to inform outcomes to assess across the interventions.
Grounding this cycle of implementation and evaluation in the CMIR will allow us to take the same theoretical
approach regardless of which interventions the Network selects. And it will allow identification of core
implementation elements and documentation of institution-specific adaptations to standardize outcomes and
lower barriers to implementation of resources in other health systems. In the final grant year, we will use
Implementation Mapping and a sustainability framework to inform design of qualitative interviews with key
operational and strategic leaders in our community partners’ health systems. We will then adapt the Network-
selected resources and implementation strategies according to findings from the qualitative interviews, using
implementation science frameworks to document adaptations to resources and strategies. Through the gLHS
Network, we expect to produce resources and strategies for implementation that will substantially advance
NHGRI’s audacious goal of routine, equitable genomic medicine."

The field of sight restoration has made dramatic progress over the last decade. Two types of
retinal implants have been commercially approved, and several other designs are in development
worldwide. In addition, two groups are actively implanting and developing cortical electronic
implants. The first optogenetic clinical trial has begun, with many others likely in the next two
years. Within a decade, many blind individuals are likely to be offered a wide range of options
for sight restoration that depend on widely different technologies.
Interactions between implant electronics and the underlying neurophysiology of the retina or
cortex mean that the vision provided by most of these technologies will differ substantially from
normal sight. The question of this proposal is – What role can cortical plasticity play in helping
patients make use of this artificial visual input?
Over the past 15 years our research group has been generating computational models, developed
using a combination of physiological and psychophysical data, which can predict the percepts
that patients might experience for a variety of sight recovery technologies. We propose to use
these models to simulate, within visually normal participants, four critical neurophysiological
distortions inherent in sight restoration technologies:
Aim 1. Abnormal neuronal population responses during retinal stimulation: Simultaneous stimulation of
on and off cells.
Aim 2. Spatial distortions: Stimulation of retinal ganglion cell axons.
Aim 3. Abnormal cortical neuronal population responses: Distortions induced by the V1 neural
architecture.
Aim 4. Temporal blurring due to slow optogenetic kinetics.
Our goal is to use normally sighted participants, viewing distorted visual input, as ‘virtual
patients’ to learn which spatiotemporal distortions can be compensated for by plasticity, and
which must be compensated for in device design. This will provide device manufacturers with a
more nuanced understanding of the abilities and limits of visual perceptual adaptability.
Finally, this work will provide novel insights regarding the fundamental mechanisms of cortical
plasticity by asking whether, in adulthood, it is possible to reconfigure the fundamental building blocks
of visual perception?"
10953964,"ABSTRACT: Visual pigments initiate the human visual experience, making them of great physiological interest,
and also are affected in retinal diseases. Accordingly, numerous research efforts have been devoted to
characterizing their structure-function relationships. Despite these efforts, critical gaps remain in our
understanding of visual pigment photochemistry and signaling properties. Knowledge of this fundamental visual
physiology is necessary to make accelerated progress in developing treatments for associated retinopathies. At
the heart of all visual pigments is a retinaldehyde chromophore that undergoes a cis-trans isomerization upon
absorption of a photon of a suitable wavelength. This complex reaction, which proceeds through several
photointermediates, triggers the conformational changes necessary for the propagation of a light stimulus into a
biochemical response. This photoactivation process ends with the hydrolysis and release of retinaldehyde, which
is required for renewal of the receptor light-sensitive state and hence continuous visual function. Fundamental
questions remain regarding receptor structure, mechanisms and modulators of hydrolysis of the retinaldehyde
Schiff base, and the modes of interaction of small molecule therapeutic candidates.
Here, we will pursue four specific aims that employ newly developed tools and approaches that we believe will
overcome previously insurmountable experimental challenges. 1) Elucidate structures of rhodopsin
photointermediates stabilized by nanobodies. Using a novel series of camelid antibodies that arrest the
rhodopsin photocycle, we will perform a detailed structure-function characterization of metarhodopsin
intermediates. 2) Define the kinetics of hydrolysis of the retinaldehyde chromophores of rhodopsin and cone
opsin pigments in native membranes. We have developed a novel mass spectrometry-based method that can,
for the first time, directly detect the retinal conjugation state of visual pigments in native membranes; we will
use this method to determine key rate constants necessary to model the interplay between visual pigment
bleaching cycles and the regenerative visual cycles. 3) Assess the influence of cytosolic effectors and visual
cycle components on the rate of hydrolysis of rhodopsin chromophore in knockout mouse models. Using the
methods described in Aim 2, we will characterize the rate of Schiff base hydrolysis in Arr1-/-, Grk1-/-, Abca4-/-,
and Rdh8-/- mice, providing new insights into how light and dark adaptation are modulated by
phototransduction and visual cycle proteins. 4) Characterize the molecular architecture of rhodopsin
complexes with lipids and small molecules using native mass spectrometry. Using the native MS technique, we
will quantify phospholipids that associate with rhodopsin in its various activation states. We will also validate
the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of small molecule therapeutic candidates in vivo. We believe the
information gleaned from these studies will enhance our understanding of retinal diseases at the molecular
level and enable the development of novel strategies for their treatment."
10972820,"HMGA1 Chromatin Regulators in Pancreatic Carcinogenesis
ABSTRACT
Background: We propose to elucidate mechanisms mediated by High Mobility Group A1 (HMGA1)
chromatin regulators in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) are highly
lethal cancers characterized by invasive tumor cells and a dense desmoplastic stroma. HMGA1 gene expression
is activated during embryogenesis, but silenced postnatally in most adult, differentiated tissues. In diverse,
cancers, such as PDAC, HMGA1 becomes re-expressed where high levels portend adverse outcomes. HMGA1
the role of HMGA1 in pancreatic carcinogenesis is only beginning to emerge. Here, we focus on actionable
pathways downstream of HMGA1 as novel therapeutic targets in PDAC.
Our scientific premise that HMGA1 drives tumor progression in PDAC is based on the following preliminary
results: 1) HMGA1 is highly overexpressed in PDAC where high levels predict decreased survival, 2) As we
recently published (JCI, 2023), silencing HMGA1 blocks diverse oncogenic properties in PDAC cell lines while
depleting tumor-initiator cells in xenografts, 3) In KPC mice with PDAC driven by mutant Kras and Tp53,
deficiency of HMGA1 disrupts tumorigenesis while prolonging survival. 4) Surprisingly, loss of just a single
Hmga1 allele within the pancreatic epithelium is sufficient to impair both tumor and stroma formation in KPC
mice, 5) Mechanistically, HMGA1 functions as an epigenetic switch by activating transcriptional networks
involved in proliferation and oncogenic transformation in PDAC cell line models, including the FGF19 growth
factor gene, 6) Targeting FGF19 gene expression or function by FGFR4 receptor blockade in xenograft models
disrupts tumor and stroma formation, 7) Most importantly, tumors with high expression of both HMGA1 and
FGF19 define a molecular subclass of human PDAC with exceptionally poor outcomes. 8) In KPC mice, Hmga1
deficiency within pancreatic epithelium results in increasing immune cell infiltration in pancreatic tumors,
suggesting that HMGA1 also drives immune evasion by
Together, these intriguing results support the following hypotheses: 1) HMGA1 is required for PDAC
progression and stroma formation through epigenetic alterations and gene networks that foster aberrant
proliferation, differentiation, and TME signaling. 2) HMGA1 within tumor cells modulates the TME to promote
immune evasion, 3) Targeting pathways governed by HMGA1 will provide novel therapeutic strategies.
Aims/Approach: To test this, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) To precisely define HMGA1-
dependent mechanisms in tumor progression using KPC mice and primary human tumors, and, 2) To test
targeting HMGA1 pathways for therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models.
Impact: This work should reveal new paradigms for PDAC pathogenesis and lead to novel approaches
to treat, or even prevent, these profoundly recalcitrant tumors."
10973074,"PROJECT SUMMARY (PI: YU)
Since bones and cartilage (B&C) are common sites of serious degenerative diseases (e.g. cancer, arthritis,
osteoporosis), a strategy to localize therapeutic agents to skeletal tissue (for high efficacy) with minimal
distribution to other sites (for low side effects) could lead to significant improvement in treating a wide range of
debilitating conditions. Recent advances in antibody therapy have produced promising drugs for rheumatoid
arthritis (e.g. infliximab, abatacept); however they have off-site, target related side effects due to systemic
immune suppression. Due to these side effects, mainly serious infection, patients need to be screened for
therapy, and co- or concurrent administration of two types of immune modulatory drugs is not practiced
although such approach may treat RA symptoms better. Based on a new understanding of RA biology and our
recent findings that collagen hybridizing peptide (CHP) can bind to degraded collagen in skeletal tissues
undergoing pathologic resorption, we propose to develop joint targeted antibody therapy that can seek and
bind to collagens degraded by rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In aim 1, we will synthesize new CHP structures that
have high affinity to denatured collagen. In aim 2, we plan to develop RA joint-targeted anti-TNF-a therapy by
conjugating CHP to Fab that can neutralize mouse TNF-a. In aim 3, we will study the pharmacological
properties, efficacy, and systemic immune suppression of the Fab-CHP conjugates in RA mouse models.
Latest understanding of RA disease mechanism teaches that immune activations in RA take place locally at the
disease site and most of TNF-a are produced by the inflamed tissue. Since off-site side effects are the major
limitation of antibody therapy, the ability to localize immunomodulatory drugs could lead to high efficacy and
low side effects. The success of this work may lead to an entirely new platform for antibody therapy for RA and
other autoimmune diseases."

The overarching goal of this NIH/DoD/VA Pain Management Collaboratory project, wHOPE (Whole Health
Options for Pain Education) is to generate evidence for the VA Whole Health model in addressing chronic pain
in a national sample of veterans across six geographically distinct VA healthcare systems. Specifically, we will
evaluate a Whole Health Team (WHT), including a medical provider with training in integrative medicine, a CIH
provider (e.g., yoga instructor, acupuncturist, nutritionist) and a Whole Health coach that collaborates with
patients to develop a Personalized Health Plan, emphasizing non-pharmacological approaches to pain
management. Specific Aim 1 is to determine whether a Whole Health Team approach is superior to Primary
Care Group Education (PC-GE, modified group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Pain), and whether
both are superior to VA Usual Primary Care (UPC) in decreasing pain interference in veterans with moderate
to severe chronic pain (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes include changes in pain severity, quality of
life, non-pharmacological therapies, use of pain medications (including opioids), and mental health symptoms
in trial participants across the three study arms. To collect patient-reported outcomes, masked telephone
assessments will be conducted at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Aim 2 is to conduct a process evaluation
of the two active interventions (WHT and PC-GE) and a budget impact analysis that includes costs to
implement the two active interventions and control (UPC) to inform the development of an implementation
toolkit for scaling and dissemination. Eligible participants are veterans reporting moderate to severe chronic
pain present every day or nearly every day for ≥ 6 months. The total sample size for the population is based on
our main study aim/hypothesis and is N=765. This breaks down to n=341 in each of the active interventions
(WHT and PC-GE) and n=83 in the control (UPC). Results of this UG3/UH3 Pain Management Collaboratory
project will contribute to the overall mission of the NIH/DoD/VA initiative to build national-level infrastructure
that supports non-pharmacologic pain management in veterans and military service personnel. As the study
has been conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, Aim 3 will use a nationwide cohort of veterans from the
entire VA system to investigate the differential impact of the COVID pandemic on racial/ethnic minority,
women, and rural Veterans’ use of Whole Health and CIH services for chronic pain management."
10973694,"Project Summary

Investigating the neural bases of social behavior is critical for our understanding of complex, high-level cognition. Despite recent efforts to examine complex social cognition on a neural level, there are still many questions left unanswered. One prominent question is whether internal states typically associated with motivation and arousal can also be found in social domains. Internal states are indexed by continuous neural activity patterns that fluctuate over time and reliably predict specific behaviors. So far, internal states predictive of social behavior, known as social states, have only been shown in flies and mice. These results are foundational for the study of social states but cannot speak to complex social behaviors found in other species. Nonhuman primates exhibit some of the richest social behaviors that are likely guided by social states. Preliminary data in our lab shows that specific neural states predict social gaze during dyadic social interactions and expressing social preferences in macaques. This early evidence supports future endeavors in characterizing primate social states, including those described in this proposal. Internal states are often impacted by external environmental factors. For social states, this may include incoming social information from the environment such as visual or auditory communication from conspecifics. Such states may also be systematically affected by prosocial and antagonistic communication. However, whether social states are systematically influenced by social environmental information, and are therefore vulnerable to manipulation, is unknown. It is also unknown what regions of the brain may be implicated in social states. A prime candidate region for investigating this question is the basolateral amygdala (BLA), an area known for its broad involvement in social cognition and internal states. This proposal introduces the overarching hypothesis that social behaviors are driven by internal states and are vulnerable to changes by external social stimuli. In Aim 1 I will investigate whether visual and auditory stimuli carrying specific social information (‘social stimulus conditioning’) impacts specific behaviors involving social attention and perception. Potential impacts by social stimulus conditioning will be evaluated across two behavioral paradigms and provide knowledge on whether social states are generalized. In Aim 2, I will expand this research to include neural investigations of social states including possible involvement of the BLA. Neural states predicting specific social behaviors will be characterized through machine learning approaches. This will be the first study to compare social stimulus conditioning and social state induction in nonhuman primates. Overall, this proposal will address novel questions of primate social states and further our understanding of neural mechanisms underlying complex social behavior."
10972902,"Coiled-helix-coiled-helix domain containing protein 10 (CHCHD10, D10) is the first mitochondrial protein to be
associated with familial frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The normal function
of D10 remains unknown, but to date several pathogenic D10 mutations have been reported. Our most recent
studies have demonstrated that mutant D10 forms fibrillar amyloid aggregates that could participate in the
pathogenesis of D10 frontotemporal dementia and may even contribute to Alzheimer’s disease. We propose
that accumulation of mutant D10 amyloid aggregates disrupt mitochondrial proteostasis and activate
mitochondrial integrated stress response (mtISR), leading to widespread metabolic alterations in affected
tissues. Gaps in knowledge remain on how D10 mutations affect protein structure, folding, and interactions with
mitochondrial membranes, leading to protein aggregation, amyloid formation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and
neuronal degeneration in frontotemporal dementia. The first aim of this MPI R01 application proposes to
elucidate the structural and molecular basis of D10 aggregation using an array of state-of-the art biochemical
and structural approaches. It will investigate whether D10 fibrils occur in the brain of mouse models and human
postmortem samples and whether their atomic resolution structures differ from those of D10 fibrils formed in
vitro. We propose to test whether D10 disease mutants are associated with distinct structural strains, and if D10
fibrils can lead to seeding and spreading of aggregation in cells and in vivo, as in other forms of dementia
associated with amyloid. The second aim is translational in nature and exploits the lack of detrimental
consequences of downregulating D10 in vivo. In collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, it will test the
neuroprotective and systemic effects of antisense oligonucleotides against D10 in an animal model of mutant
D10 neurodegeneration, the D10 S55L knock in (KI) mouse. The goal is to decrease the protein aggregation
burden and alleviate mtISR and pathology in this mouse model of D10 pathology. The third aim will investigate
autophagy in vivo to assess whether it is altered in D10 S55L KI mouse and test approaches to enhance
autophagy in the CNS to eliminate D10 aggregates. Moreover, since general autophagy can eliminate both
cytosolic aggregates and mitochondria, to discriminate between these two components, we will use a genetic
approach to selectively enhance mitophagy. The proposed project takes advantage of the complementary
expertise of Dr. Kawamata, an expert in modeling and studying neurodegenerative diseases and Dr. Eliezer,
an expert in protein structure and biochemistry and in alterations of protein folding and aggregation in
neurodegeneration. Successful outcomes of this project could pave the way to clinical development of
therapeutic strategies for D10-linked frontotemporal dementia."

 Primary glomerular diseases, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
(FSGS), immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), and membranous nephropathy (MN), are associated with
significant morbidity and mortality in both adults and children. Cure Glomerulonephropathy (CureGN) is a
prospective, longitudinal observational cohort study launched in 2013 to address critical knowledge gaps in the
pathogenesis, natural history, and response to therapy of these heterogeneous disorders. It is a study of
unprecedented size and remarkable depth, built by a unique collaborative interdisciplinary community. The
international consortium includes researchers with diverse expertise, affected patients and advocacy groups,
the biopharmaceutical industry, and federal funding agencies. CureGN has successfully recruited a diverse
cohort of nearly 2800 adult and pediatric participants with MCD, FSGS, IgAN and MN from more than 60
clinical study sites. Biospecimens, clinical data, and patient reported outcomes are collected to enable high-
quality clinical, mechanistic, and translational investigations. This foundational work is being conducted by a
collaborative infrastructure including the Data Coordinating Center (at the University of Michigan, Northwestern
University and Cleveland Clinic) and four Participating Clinical Centers (managed at the University of
Pennsylvania, Columbia University, University of North Carolina, and the Pediatric Nephrology Research
Consortium). CureGN is paving the way for personalized care in glomerular disease by disentangling the
heterogeneity within these disorders that are etiologically diverse but currently grouped into only four
diagnoses.
 In CureGN’s third study phase, we propose to maintain and enhance the CureGN Consortium infrastructure
and ancillary studies program to accelerate patient-relevant glomerular disease research. We will continue our
core observational study, enrolling additional participants in a recruit-to-replace strategy to maintain an active
cohort of 2000 participants with high quality clinical data and biospecimens. We will implement state of the art
tools for remote data and biospecimen collection, expand biospecimen types, and implement the use of new
mobile applications for patient engagement and medical record linkages. Mature scientific working groups,
committees and ancillary infrastructure will continue to support a multidisciplinary core and ancillary study
program to achieve the scientific goals of CureGN. We will continue our outreach to the scientific community by
enhancing CureGN’s role as an outstanding training vehicle for the next generation of glomerular disease
researchers and attracting cutting-edge, established scientists to glomerular disease through opportunity pool
grants, collaborations with patient advocacy groups and professional societies, training workshops and support
of ancillary studies from academic and industry partners. Through this coordinated effort, CureGN is prepared
to accelerate improvements in the care of patients with glomerular disease."
10973496,"Neuropathic pain arises from nervous system injuries due to trauma, disease, or neurotoxin exposure afflicts
15-20 million people in the U.S is very difficult to treat.1-6 Currently available therapeutics include anticonvulsants,
antidepressants and opioids; these have limited efficacy and possess many side effects including high abuse
liability.4 Novel non opioid based targets are needed for therapeutic intervention. We believe that we have found
such target; the Gi/o protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Gpr34. Our unbiased transcriptomic approach in a rat
model of traumatic nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain7 revealed that GPR34 increases in the dorsal horn of
the spinal cord ipsilateral to nerve injury. GPR34 is expressed in both humans and rodents and is highly
expressed in microglia.8-10 Its primary endogenous ligand is lysophosphatidylserine (LysoPS).11 Little is known
about the roles of LysoPS/GPR34 in pain. One study reported GPR34 deletion in the spinal cord reversed nerve
injury-induced neuropathic pain by suppressing pro-inflammatory responses of microglia.12 Chemical probes for
GPR34, especially antagonists, are limited with only on reported antagonists (Takeda).13 We synthesized this
compound (SLU-PP-2368) and found it antagonized LysoPS-induced β-arrestin recruitment and reversed
mechano- and cold allodynia in two rodent models7,14 with no observable side effects or engaging the
endogenous opioid system (preliminary data). This compound has poor physicochemical properties limiting its
clinical utility. Using the cryoEM structure of GPR34 bound with a synthetic agonist,15 we synthesized three
analogs (SLU-PP-2438, -2439 and -2440) with GPR34 antagonistic activity and improved solubility and stability.
Systemic and intrathecal administration of these antagonists reversed behavioral hypersensitivities in two
models of neuropathic pain7,14 (preliminary data). LysoPS (i.th.) in rodents recapitulated behavioral phenotypes
seen in the nerve-injury models and evoked dose- and time-dependent pertussis toxin-sensitive (Gαi/o-linked)
behavioral hypersensitivities that were blocked by GPR34 antagonists. Collectively, these data identify the spinal
cord as a potential site of GPR34 antagonist action that contributes to neuropathic pain. The mechanisms
engaged by LysoPS/GPR34 signaling that contribute to neuropathic pain are unknown, but studies implicate
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.11,16,17 Our driving hypothesis is that GPR34 in the
spinal cord is a non-opioid based target for therapeutic intervention with GPR34 antagonists and the analgesic
actions of GPR34 antagonists result from attenuating MAPK in microglia. We also hypothesize that identifying
CNS-active GPR34 hits will allow future development of novel GPR34 antagonists with intellectual property
potential as drug candidates for neuropathic pain. Results from our studies are anticipated to develop a strong
biological rationale and establish a multidisciplinary team and infrastructure to develop CNS-penetrant selective
GPR34 antagonists that will be used for a therapeutics development plan to enable a future application for RFA-
NS-21-015, thereby directly addressing RFA-NS-21-029."
10974466,"Background and Objective: One in five older adults has Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a precursor of
dementia. Apathy, a profound loss of initiative and motivation, is seen in as high as 60% of patients with MCI.
Patients with apathy often neglect activities they are fully capable of, related to self-care and physical activity,
which leads to long term impairment and disability. Apathy is associated with impaired executive function,
increased caregiver burden, and higher rates of conversion to dementia. Treatment of apathy in MCI has the
potential to improve the psychological and cognitive health status of Veterans enabling them to function more
fully in society. Apathy treatment may also fundamentally alter the trajectory of neurodegeneration. However,
apathy research sorely lacks: non-pharmacological treatments, objective measurements, biomarkers, and
knowledge whether treatment of apathy improves function, reduces caregiver burden, and decreases
conversion from MCI to dementia. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied to the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has yielded promising results in apathy treatment.
The study will examine the efficacy of rTMS treatment on apathy and related measures such as cognition,
functional status, quality of life, and caregiver burden. Lasting effects of these changes during long-term
follow-up will also be examined. An innovation of the proposal is to use a cognitive response from a single
session of rTMS to predict a behavioral response to the longer course of treatment. The study also proposes
to test two promising candidates for validity as biomarkers for apathy research. Finally, the study will explore
if rTMS treatment influences the rates of conversion of MCI to dementia.
Research Plan: A three phase study has been designed. Phase I will consist of comprehensive
assessment and a single session of stimulation in participants eligible for rTMS (N = 75). Phase II will be a
double-blind sham controlled randomized trial of rTMS for apathy (N = 50). Phase III will be a series of
assessments annually till the end of the study to ascertain rates of conversion to dementia (N = 125).
Aim 1 will determine the efficacy and lasting effects of rTMS in treating apathy in MCI compared to sham
treatment. Aim 2 will determine the efficacy and lasting effects of rTMS on cognition, functional status, quality
of life, and caregiver burden compared to sham treatment. Aim 3 will determine the predictive validity of
changes in executive function (Conner's Continuous Performance Test) and biomarker (Brain Derived
Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)) correlates of apathy after a single session of active rTMS to the overall change
in apathy after 4-weeks of treatment. Aim 4 will compare the rates of conversion of MCI to dementia in those
that received rTMS to sham treatment. This exploratory aim will enable determination of the effect size for
preventing/delaying dementia and serve as the foundation for a larger, more definitive study.
Methods: Older Veterans (N = 125) meeting the modified Mayo Clinic criteria for MCI will be enrolled. Their
behavioral profile (Neuropsychiatric Inventory), apathy, physical function, memory, executive function, and
caregiver burden will be assessed at regular intervals. Blood will be drawn three times to estimate ApoE4
carrier status and BDNF levels. Actigraphs will be used to measure physical activity correlates of apathy. Fifty
participants will undergo 20 treatments with either active rTMS coil or sham coil. Yearly assessments for
incident dementia will be done. Hypotheses related to the primary outcome measures will be tested with 80%
power to detect at least 0.7 standard deviations difference in means between the active and sham groups.
Clinical Relevance: Knowledge gained from the successful completion of this project will help improve the
management of apathy, decrease caregiver burden, and improve the quality of life of veterans with MCI.
Results from this study can be readily translated to clinical practice as rTMS is currently available for
depression treatment in many VA medical centers."
10974500,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Comprised of six distinct layers, the cerebral cortex is the key brain structure for all of our cognitive
abilities, ranging from sensation to decision making to movement. Each layer contains distinct cell types differing
in their genes, biophysical properties, and connectivity with other parts of the nervous system. Yet how these
diverse cortical layers and cell types are involved in any given behavior remains unresolved. Moreover, we
currently lack insight into how aging impacts interactions between cortical layers, which severely limits our
understanding of how aging alters cortical circuit function. At the most basic level, the cortex can be divided into
deep and superficial layers, each of which receives a complete copy of sensory information from the thalamus.
This suggests that the two sets of layers constitute different processing systems, which begs the question: what
are the possible purposes of these parallel networks? Because these processing streams differ in input, output,
intrinsic membrane, synaptic integration, and spike generation properties, I hypothesize that deep and superficial
layers have unique, independent functions. This also raises the intriguing possibility that these pathways are
differentially susceptible to aging. I hypothesize that aging leads to layer-specific changes that ultimately lead to
unique age-related deficits in cortical circuit function.
 Investigating the functions and age-related changes in deep and superficial cortical networks requires a
cortex-dependent task. In Dr. Bruno’s lab at Columbia University (F99), I developed a whisker-mediated texture
discrimination task for head-fixed mice, demonstrated that this behavior requires the cortex, and revealed that
both deep and superficial layers are involved in processing texture information (Aim 1.0, progress report). I
propose to characterize the sensorimotor strategies required for this behavior (Aim 1.1) and how layer-specific
manipulations alter texture representation in the deep and superficial layers (Aim 1.2). Understanding the
computations performed by individual layers will not only expand our understanding of the complex cortical
circuitry, but will also provide insight into how aging and neurodegeneration – which often involve dysfunction of
specific cortical cell types, layers, and their pathways – may be mitigated through the development of targeted
therapies. In Dr. Tsai’s lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (K00), I will develop a novel therapy that
galvanizes the brain’s own mechanisms to noninvasively improve cognitive and behavioral health in aged and
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) model mice. To do so, I will first identify how aging and AD alter learning, performance,
sensorimotor strategies (Aim 2.1), and sensory processing across cortical circuits (Aim 2.2) on my texture
discrimination task. These findings will inform the development of a noninvasive therapy that stimulates cortical
circuits to protect sensory and motor functions from aging and AD pathology (Aim 2.3). This proposal will advance
our limited understanding of how aging dynamically alters cortical circuits in vivo and may lead to an effective
intervention to prevent age and disease-related functional impairments in human patients."

 Acquired cognitive impairment associated with aging, neurocognitive disorders, like Alzheimer’s disease, and traumatic brain injury (TBI) pose major challenges to healthcare systems throughout the world. To facilitate successful aging, effective methods are needed for monitoring cognition in order to detect early signs of impaired cognition and dementia. However, the effectiveness of existing neuropsychological assessments is thwarted by their sporadicity, difficulty in accounting for the context-dependent nature of patients’ health (e.g., having a “good” or a “bad” day), and reliance on frequently inaccurate patient and caregiver reports. Thus, new approaches are needed for objective and ecologically valid assessment of cognitive function and for early detection of impaired cognition associated with neurocognitive disorders like Alzheimer’s disease and TBI.
 Current mHealth and AI approaches enable continuous context inference from smartphone use and location data. Patient reports of Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs) can be greatly enhanced with continuous, objective context inferences from passively collected smartphone-based data that can contribute to earlier and more accurate diagnoses of neurocognitive disorder including Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia. Cross-sectional studies involving younger and older adults suggest that characteristics of an individual’s mobile application use and typing speed correlate with working memory, attention, and psychomotor function. Therefore, the proposed augmentation of clinical assessments with continuous and objective estimates of cognitive changes derived computationally and unobtrusively from mobile application use characteristics and motor interactions has the potential to inform both the early detection and diagnosis of impaired cognition associated with neurocognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease and TBI, and potentially treatment selection for their amelioration.
 The central hypothesis to be tested in this longitudinal study is that changes in cognition, including impaired cognition associated with Alzheimer’s disease and other neurocognitive disorders, can be inferred from smartphone data. 
 In the F99 phase, Mr. Kos will a) augment existing measures derived from IADLs and lifespace mobility with analogous measures inferred from mobile location-finding systems (e.g., GPS) and application use data, and b) propose a digital biomarker for tracking cognitive changes and impaired cognition based on temporal patterns in application use and motor interactions with smartphones. Validation will be conducted on 80 middle-aged individuals; 20 with subjective cognitive impairment, 20 with diagnosed Mild Cognitive Impairment, 20 with TBI, and 20 cognitively intact controls.
In the K00 phase, Mr. Kos will select the subset of these measures determined to be most applicable to tracking cognitive changes and impaired cognition and, thus, prime for detecting early signs of Alzheimer’s disease and other types of neurocognitive disorder in older adults. Their refinement and validation in clinical trials using biomarkers and brain imaging data will enable developing a mechanistic understanding of a) the relationships between impaired cognition, Alzheimer’s disease, and neurocognitive changes including TBI and b) how these relationships are reflected in interactions with mobile technologies."
10974673,"A defining property of cancers that lack intrinsic immune surveillance is the absence of costimulatory context in
myeloid cells—macrophages and dendritic cells (DC)—preventing tumor antigen cross presentation and CD8+T
cell priming. There is overwhelming empirical evidence that tumor antigen-specific antitumor immunity requires
endogenous, sustained type-I interferon (IFN) release in myeloid cells. To accomplish this, multiple strategies of
activating diverse pattern recognition receptors (PRR) were devised for clinical investigation. Several key deficits
of such small molecule PRR agonists have prevented breakthrough clinical progress: they lack target specificity
for myeloid cells; they do not produce the multilayered, carefully orchestrated innate signaling cascades elicited
by innate sensing of natural pathogen challenge; they often produce toxic inflammatory patterns unsuitable for
generating antitumor CD8+T cell immunity, eg. due to release of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) cytokines.
 We are investigating PVSRIPO, the highly attenuated rhino:poliovirus chimera for cancer immunotherapy.
PVSRIPO, like its poliovirus parent, has natural target tropism for macrophages/DCs. Infection of myeloid cells is
non-cytopathogenic; rather, it elicits endogenous, sustained type-I IFN release due to activation of the MDA5
PRR. The PVSRIPO innate signature is type-I IFN dominant, due to polar TBK1-IRF3 signaling, lacks notorious
CRS cytokines, and was shown to mediate polyfunctional antitumor CD8+T cell responses that were qualitatively
superior to those elicited by other PRR agonists. CD8+T cells from PVSRIPO-treated tumor-bearing mice
exhibited significantly greater antitumor activity in adoptive T cell assays compared to toll-like receptor (TLR)-
agonists. Thus, the macrophage/DC-targeted, multilayered and “PRR-contextualized” type-I IFN dominant
pattern of PVSRIPO may be optimal for invigorating tumor antigen cross presentation and CD8+T cell priming.
 We hypothesize that promising results with PVSRIPO in Ph1 clinical trials in recurrent glioblastoma
and -melanoma are due to its peculiar and unique type-I IFN signature in myeloid cells; and that intrinsic
factors that repress innate responsiveness in myeloid cells pose obstacles to PVSRIPO clinical
effectiveness. MDA5/RIG-I-mediated type-I IFN responses in myeloid cells are highly susceptible to prevailing
metabolic conditions, in particular glycolytic metabolism/lactate production. Our premise is that unraveling the
nexus linking viral RNA replication and MDA5-TBK1-IRF3 innate signaling to glycolytic metabolism will
enable new immunotherapy approaches that enhance innate type-I IFN responses with metabolic
modifiers. We propose the following Specific Aims: (1) Determine the landscape of glycolytic metabolism in
MDA5-sensed viral infection of myeloid cells; (2) Elucidate the role of glycolytic metabolism in the innate
inflammatory response in myeloid cells; (3) Determine if modulating glycolytic pathways can bolster anti-glioma
responses to PVSRIPO and enhance antitumor immunity after virotherapy."

The Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES) Project seeks to
broaden and deepen our scientific understanding of language development by
providing new ways of analyzing real world face-to-face interactions. The
computational tools that had been developed in the previous phases of the
project constitute the primary methodological basis for new empirical research on
the development of spontaneous use of a first language. This work has resulted
in over 10,000 published articles examining all aspects of language development,
including word learning, sound learning, grammatical development, and
communicative development. All of the programs and data sets are provided
over the web without charge to researchers. The database that has been
collected using these tools is now the largest database on natural spoken
language interactions available anywhere. However, we can achieve still greater
efficiency and analytic precision by building even more powerful computational
tools. The next phase of this project will develop new techniques to support
analytic methods in the study of language development. These methods include
rapid computer-assisted transcription of interactions, diarization of daylong audio
recordings made in the home, automatic analysis of morphological and syntactic
structures, a simple user interface for searches, web-based support for
collaborative commentary between research groups, construction of standard
comparison group norms, and methods for moving data between different
programs for alternative analyses. In addition, we will promote the use of the
database and programs by constructing web-based tutorials, by improving the
current user interface, and by conducting workshops and presentations at
conferences."
10974122,"Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. Because elevated intraocular pressure
(IOP) and IOP fluctuations are the primary risk factors for loss of visual field, the current standard of care
for adult-onset glaucoma includes treatment with IOP-lowering medications, which are typically delivered topically
as eye drops. Unfortunately, the need for self-administration negatively affects patient compliance. Moreover,
there are a limited number of drug families that are in use. In a major step toward addressing the limitations of
currently marketed IOP-lowering drops, we engineered a novel non-irritative microemulsion (ME) formulation that
provides extended release of pregabalin (PRG)¾a repurposed FDA-approved drug with a new mechanism of
action for IOP-lowering. While our ME has many features that position it to fill major gap in IOP management, it
requires daily self-dosing. To directly address this unmet clinical need, we will optimize and evaluate the
IOP-lowering properties and safety of a subconjunctival biodegradable electrospun depot containing
PRG. OculoTherapy’s long-term research goal is to develop therapies that preserve vision in glaucoma patients.
In this current SBIR Phase I application, we test the hypothesis that a subconjunctival depot comprised of slowly
biodegradable and biocompatible nanospun polymers can be engineered to provide zero order release of
PRG, which will maintain IOP in the physiological range until the depot is spent. Our objective is to ultimately
achieve 6 months of release from a single depot. Our hypothesis is supported our preliminary data demonstrating
that PRG-loaded nanofibers comprised of a polymeric blend provide release of PRG with only 54.4% of loaded
drug being released after 21 weeks, demonstrating that 6 months of release from a single depot is well within
range. Overall strengths of this project include: 1) a strong and experienced interdisciplinary OculoTherapy team;
2) engineering of an innovative delivery strategy using a polymeric biocompatible depot that is expected to
provide extended drug release; 3) the use of a highly promising FDA-approved drug that is being repurposed as a
glaucoma therapeutic; and 4) the potential for a highly significant increase in patient adherence because the need
for daily input from the patient is eliminated. In this Phase I SBIR proposal, we provide proof-of-concept data and
address key feasibility questions by establishing the safety and efficacy of a bioengineered
subconjunctivally placed polymer depot. Aim 1: We test the hypothesis that a subconjunctival electrospun depot
comprised of biodegradable and biocompatible polymers can provide up to 6 months of zero order release of
PRG. Several polymers and polymer blends will be evaluated either alone or in combination. Aim 2: We test the
hypothesis that our subconjunctival PRG depot is biocompatible and efficacious. IOP and safety will be evaluated.
Ocular biodistribution studies will also be performed. Minimum performance metrics include: 1) a sustained
decrease in IOP for 6 months from a single depot; 2) no significant development of tolerance or foreign body
response; and 3) an intraocular distribution of the drug that correlates with its effect on IOP reduction."
10972708,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Microorganisms produce molecules of vast structural and functional diversity. In particular, the polyketide class
of natural products holds a profound track record for being repurposed as medicinally relevant molecules.
Polyketides are natively produced by multi-enzyme assemblies called synthases. Within each polyketide
synthase (PKS) an acyl carrier protein (ACP) plays the central role of transferring and presenting molecular
building blocks and intermediates to its team of enzymatic partners. The strategic redesign of PKSs presents
an exciting and sustainable route to access new antibiotics and anticancer agents; However, the success of
any redesign approach hinges on a thorough understanding of how ACPs interact with different substrates and
enzymes during the biosynthetic process. In particular, how ACPs select their molecular building blocks is a
foundational question that if answered could enable the strategic engineering of PKSs to incorporate desired
structures at targeted locations on the polyketide product. The goal of this study is to uncover the molecular
ground rules for why some ACPs strictly accept a single substrate through an acyl transferase (AT) facilitated
exchange whereas others can bypass the gate-keeping AT and ‘self-acylate’ with a broader range of
substrates. This will be accomplished by 1) connecting ACP self-acylation ability to ACP sequence and
secondary structure, 2) characterizing ACP conformational dynamics and substrate scope, and 3) engineering
ACPs to display modified acylation properties.
Innovative methods, such as site-specific vibrational spectroscopy, will be used to connect fast ACP
conformational dynamics to acylation properties, providing unprecedented temporal insights. The approach to
PKS engineering is novel in that critical ACP-protein interactions, which when disrupted often lead to system
failure, will be maintained. Thus, these studies directly address the limited substrate scope of native polyketide
biosynthetic pathways as an alternative route to unlocking access to novel polyketides. Over 30 undergraduate
students will engage in this work at the chemistry-biology interface through independent research projects and
course-based undergraduate research experiences, thereby expanding the impact of the proposed research
into training the next generation of critical thinkers and innovators."

 Primary glomerular diseases, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental
glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), and membranous nephropathy (MN), are
associated with significant morbidity and mortality in both adults and children. The Cure Glomerulonephropathy
(CureGN) study launched in 2013 to address critical knowledge gaps in the disease pathogenesis, natural
history, and response to therapy of these heterogeneous disorders. It is a study of unprecedented size and
remarkable depth, built by a unique collaborative interdisciplinary community. The international consortium
includes researchers with diverse expertise, affected patients and advocacy groups, the biopharmaceutical
industry, and federal funding agencies. CureGN has successfully recruited a diverse cohort of nearly 2800
adult and pediatric participants with MCD, FSGS, IgAN and MN from more than 60 clinical study sites into a
prospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study. Biospecimens, clinical data, and patient reported
outcomes are collected to enable high-quality clinical, mechanistic, and translational investigations. This
foundational work is being conducted by a well-functioning collaborative group including the Data Coordinating
Center (at the University of Michigan, Northwestern University and Cleveland Clinic) and four Participating
Clinical Centers (managed at the University of Pennsylvania, Columbia University, University of North Carolina,
and the Pediatric Nephrology Research Consortium). CureGN will pave the way for personalized care in
glomerular disease by disentangling the heterogeneity of disorders that are etiologically diverse but currently
grouped into only four diagnoses.
 In CureGN’s third study phase, we propose to maintain and enhance the CureGN Consortium
infrastructure and ancillary study program to accelerate patient-relevant glomerular disease research. We will
continue our core observational study, enrolling additional participants in a recruit-to-replace strategy to
maintain an active cohort of 2000 participants with high quality clinical data and biomaterials. We will
implement state of the art data collection tools including remote data and biospecimen collection, new
biospecimen types, and use of mobile devices for patient facing engagement and medical record linkages.
Mature scientific working groups, committees and ancillary infrastructure will continue to support a core and
ancillary study program to achieve the scientific goals of CureGN. We will continue outreach to the scientific
community by expanding CureGN’s role as an outstanding training vehicle for the next generation of
glomerular disease researchers and attracting cutting-edge, established scientists to glomerular disease
through opportunity pool grants, collaborations with patient advocacy groups and professional societies,
training workshops and support of ancillary studies from academic and industry partners. Through this
coordinated effort, CureGN is prepared to accelerate the improvement care of glomerular disease patients."

Montana Technological University is commonly referred to as “Montana Tech” and will
be denoted as such throughout this proposal narrative. This proposal is for a single TPG
supporting two academic training programs; one conducted at the undergraduate level,
and the other conducted at the graduate level:
1. Undergraduate: BS Occupational Safety and Health Academic Training Program,
2. Graduate: MS Industrial Hygiene Academic Training Program which includes:
 a. MS Industrial Hygiene campus degree program (referred herein as MS IH
 Program), and the
 b. MS Industrial Hygiene Distance Learning/Professional Track degree program
 (referred herein as MS IH Distance Learning Program)
The three degrees are currently supported by our most recent TPG application;
however, they were previously submitted as a single academic training program. Our
revised approach which seeks support for two academic training programs is intended to
enhance the clarity of our application. All programs are managed and housed in the
Safety, Health, and Industrial Hygiene (SHIH) Department. Five faculty members in the
Department are substantially involved in teaching and research, while one faculty
member serves in a part-time program management role. The SHIH Department faculty
work harmoniously to achieve department and degree program goals and objectives.
The five faculty members are considered key personnel for both training programs.
The primary goal of our training programs is the education of capable graduates to help
meet the ever-growing demand for health and safety leadership in the U.S. This goal is
supported by four updated objectives: 1) maintaining high quality inclusive curricula to
meet the diverse needs of our constituents, 2) managing programs to enhance
enrollment and graduate placement numbers and to promote diversity within our
programs, 3) developing engaging student experiences, both professional and research-
based, and 4) sustaining high quality faculty. The continued development of our
programs is helping to meet a strong industry demand for well-trained OSH and IH
professionals in a region that has a small number of programs. The growth of our MS IH
Distance Learning Program has expanded beyond a regional presence with successful
graduates employed throughout the US. This outcome translates directly to the urgent
need for well-prepared OSH and IH professionals, particularly in the Mountain West
region.
The NIOSH TPG grant provides funds for valuable program enhancement, primarily
through student scholarships. We propose to support 14 undergraduate students
through the BS OSH Academic Training Program and 13 graduate students (5 MS IH
and 8 MS IH Distance Learning) through the MS IH Academic Training Program per
year. Additional enhancements include student conference registration, student travel,
and faculty development. The anticipated duration for trainee support is 1-3 years, with
exceptions being kept within term restrictions provided by NIOSH. NIOSH support
unquestionably enhances program quality and recognition, which in turn supports our
primary goal of producing capable OSH and IH graduates."

The neurovascular unit (NVU) is responsible for the maintenance of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity,
cerebral homeostasis, and control of cerebral blood flow. Evidence indicates that traumatic brain injury (TBI)
alters the NVU functions and impairs the integrity of BBB; however, the mechanism is still poorly understood.
Cells have been discovered to possess phenotype-dependent intrinsic chirality, which not only reflects cellular
behaviors but also influences tissue/organ morphogenesis and physiological functions. The goal of this
proposal is to evaluate the TBI-induced changes in cell chirality and cell-cell interactions of microglia, neurons,
and brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) within the NVU. We use a pre-established TBI animal
model, combined with novel biological and engineering techniques, to complete the aims of the proposed
project. Aim 1 determines the chirality, polarization, and organelles positioning of microglia and neurons, as
well as the physical interactions between microglia and neurons after TBI. Aim 2 examines the TBI-induced
changes in the chirality of BMECs and the interaction between microglia and BMECs. Results obtained from
this project will reveal the relationship between cell chirality and cell-cell interactions of microglia, neurons, and
BMECs within the NVU. Thus, the accomplishment of this project will provide novel knowledge on cell chirality
regulation and mechanisms of NVU function, which will further set the foundation for developing cell-specific
therapeutics that can be translated to various neurological disorders."
10973206,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common cause of congenital infection, affecting an estimated 0.6-
0.7% of newborns in the USA. Depending on the timing of maternal primary infection, congenital infection can
result in severe clinical consequences and neurodevelopmental sequelae, making HCMV the leading cause of
sensorineural hearing loss in newborns. The monocyte-macrophage lineage plays a vital role in HCMV infection
in humans. Placental macrophages, known as Hofbauer cells (HBCs), therefore likely serve as a crucial barrier
to HCMV transmission to the fetus, but their role in this process is largely underexplored. The role of humoral
immunity in controlling HCMV and preventing congenital infection is complex. Anti-HCMV antibodies can perform
both neutralizing and cell activation functions, but even in the presence of specific antibody, latent HCMV has
the ability to reactivate, and patients can become reinfected with new strains. Nonetheless, reactivation and
reinfection are both associated with a much lower risk of congenital infection, suggesting that humoral immunity
is at least partly effective at preventing transmission to the fetus. With CMV vaccines now in Phase 3 trials, it is
important that we improve our understanding of HCMV antibody functioning in the placenta, including via HBCs,
which express Fc receptors, and like other macrophages, are able to perform neutralising and non-neutralising
anti-HCMV functions. The role of viral glycoproteins in HCMV entry and infection is another critical area of
investigation with profound implications for both basic virology and clinical therapeutics. These glycoproteins
serve as the mediators of virus-host cell interactions, facilitating attachment, fusion, and internalization
processes. Moreover, they play a pivotal role in immune evasion strategies employed by HCMV. Viral
glycoprotein interactions with host cells are at least partly mediated by their interaction with lectins, proteins that
recognize endogenous and/or pathogen-associated glycans. While the role of lectins in HCMV infection at the
maternal-fetal interface is poorly understood, it could offer innovative targets for therapeutic intervention.
Understanding the precise molecular mechanisms by which these glycoproteins orchestrate the entry process,
including at the maternal-fetal interface, is of paramount importance for developing targeted antiviral interventions
and can inform the design of vaccines and therapeutics. To help attain these goals, the specific aims of our
proposal are to: 1) Interrogate the temporal response of HBCs to human cytomegalovirus infection, 2) Elucidate
the role of maternal Ab in HCMV infection of HBC, 3) Identify lectin-glycan interactions involved in HCMV infection
of HBCs. Through combining several methodologies including Quantitative Temporal Viromics, functional
antibody assays, a human lectin binding array, glycomics/glycoproteomics/glycolipidomics and glycan-binding
arrays, complemented by functional in vitro investigations, performed in HBCs across gestation, we will provide
an unprecedented and overdue insight into HBC responses to viral infection."

10974824,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death world-wide. Two main reasons for this are atherosclerosis,
which narrows major arteries, and thrombosis, which results in occlusive blood clots. Despite the ongoing health
burden, the translation of experimental therapies has stalled. A common challenge for therapies addressing
atherosclerosis and thrombosis is their poor localization in sites of disease such as atherosclerotic plaque and
thrombi. Thus, there is a pressing clinical need to develop novel targeting strategies to improve therapeutic
accumulation in these sites. I hypothesize that cell-mediated delivery of nanoparticle-encapsulated therapies will
improve site-specific therapeutic accumulation to treat atherosclerosis and thrombosis. To test this, I will employ
next-generation nanoparticle synthesis technologies (Flash NanoPrecipitation (FNP) and inverse FNP) coupled
with cell-mediated delivery for the directed delivery of therapies to atherosclerotic plaque and thrombi. FNP and
iFNP are new polymeric nanoparticle synthesis technologies that uniquely address challenges related to
scalability for manufacturing. To direct these nanoparticles to sites of vascular injury, I will employ cell-mediated
delivery. In this method, nanoparticles can be either loaded into cells ex vivo or decorated with ligands to exploit
interactions with internalization receptors specifically expressed on pertinent cells in vivo. Atherosclerosis and
venous thrombosis are two disease settings characterized by immunological cell infiltration; as such, they are
uniquely suited for the application of cell-mediated delivery of nano-encapsulated therapies. With respect to
atherosclerosis, circulating activated monocytes infiltrate into the inflamed arterial wall and differentiate into
macrophages, which are centrally important to atherogenesis. Notably, these cells over-express an
internalization receptor for folic acid: folate receptor-beta. Herein, I will develop therapeutic-carrying
nanoparticles conjugated to folic acid, with the goal of being specifically internalized by activated
monocytes/macrophages thereby employing these immune cells as delivery vehicles for the localization of drug
to atherosclerotic plaque. As oxidative stress is a key driver of atherosclerotic progression, I will focus on
delivering antioxidant interventions. An equally innovative strategy using exogenous neutrophils can be used to
treat thrombosis. A key challenge in our treatment of thrombosis is a time-dependent decrease in treatment
efficacy, as aging thrombi become increasingly difficult for clot-dissolving (thrombolytic) enzymes to penetrate.
Moreover, high doses of thrombolytic enzymes can lead to dangerous bleeding. I propose to address this
penetration issue by utilizing neutrophils as cell carriers of thrombolytic proteins encapsulated in polymeric
nanoparticles. Neutrophils actively infiltrate thrombi, and can be rapidly loaded ex vivo with polymeric
nanoparticles. Employing neutrophils as a delivery vehicle would address the issue of clot penetration and could
circumvent the problem of bleeding. Overall, my project aims to develop novel cell-mediated therapeutic delivery
platforms with the goal of preventing atherosclerotic plaque progression and treatment of thrombosis."
10973211,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Aging is a complex process characterized by many hallmarks, such as DNA instability, epigenetic changes, and
loss of protein homeostasis. Cellular rejuvenation, which aims to restore cells to a youthful state, offers hope to
counteract aging and its associated diseases. Recent advances in epigenetic reprogramming using Yamanaka
factors (a set of four transcription factors) have rejuvenated aged cells to youthful states and extended lifespan
in mice. However, the clinical use of Yamanaka factors is limited due to their tumorigenic risk and full
reprogramming potential. Therefore, it is important to find new rejuvenating transcription factors that are safer
and more potent than the Yamanaka factors. The Li lab has recently developed a systematic approach and
identified ~30 potential rejuvenation transcription factors. They have identified ~30 transcription factors that can
restore youthful gene expression patterns in aged human fibroblasts in vitro. Critically, they also validated a few
top hits with cellular and molecular phenotyping of aging hallmarks. However, the underlying mechanisms by
which these transcription factors/chromatin modifiers rejuvenate aged cells, and the ability of these transcription
factors to rejuvenate other types of aged cells (such as post-mitotic cells) are unknown.
To better prepare me for such research, I propose to continue my training in cell/molecular biology by
investigating how BRWD3 regulates DNA replication and epigenetic modifications (F99 Aims). This will not only
enhance my comprehensive skill set for mechanistic studies, but also deepen my understanding and
investigative strategies for chromatin-associated proteins, which are central to my proposed F00 aging research.
During the K00 phase, I will leverage my molecular research expertise and the Li lab's system-level approaches
to advance our understanding of cellular rejuvenation. I propose to dissect the mechanism of a top rejuvenation
candidate and identify its key targets responsible for rejuvenation (K00 Aim 2.1). I will also use the induced
neurons with the system-level approaches developed by the Li lab to explore the rejuvenation potential of the
top 30 transcription factors in aged neurons (post-mitotic). Collectively, these experiments will not only deepen
our understanding of the rejuvenation mechanism, but also shed light on rejuvenation approaches for overlooked
post-mitotic cells, leading to the discovery of safer and more universal rejuvenation solutions for both mitotic and
post-mitotic cells."
10973729,"Project Summary/Abstract
Microglia, resident immune cells of the central nervous system, utilize G-protein signaling to accomplish different
tasks. Gi-signaling is used to perform process outgrowth, while Gs signaling is engaged during periods of
neuronal hypoactivity (such as anesthesia). However, very little is known about microglial Gq calcium signaling.
Partially, this is due to the fact that microglia rarely display calcium transients at rest. On the other hand, microglia
greatly elevate their calcium signaling in the period that follows status epilepticus—a prolonged seizure state
predictive of later epilepsy development. The purpose of microglial calcium signaling during epilepsy
development is not known, but is hypothesized to be a component of microglial phagocytosis. Most microglial
calcium signaling in epilepsy development is attributable to P2Y6 receptor signaling—a Gq-calcium receptor
activated by a key purine. P2Y6 is best described for its role in phagocytosis, but that has not been fully explored
in epilepsy development. (Innovation) The current proposal will utilize a novel mouse line that allows for the
simultaneous examination of microglial calcium activity and process movement in the living animal (using two-
photon microscopy). (Aim 1) This line will be used to test the role of P2Y6 in microglial phagocytosis, after
neurons are selectively killed through excitotoxicity using optogenetic techniques. In parallel, tissue studies will
be conducted across key time points in epilepsy development to determine if the loss of the P2Y6 pathway
prevents proper clearance of dead/dying neurons after status epilepticus. The prolonged presence of dying
neurons is pro-inflammatory and hypothesized to negatively affect neuronal network dynamics in the long term.
(Aim 2) For these reasons, we will test multiple aspects of long-term P2Y6 signaling loss during epilepsy
development. We will determine the long-term pro-inflammatory effects of P2Y6 signaling loss. Additionally, we
will use miniscope technology and 24/7 video EEG to determine whether the loss of P2Y6 calcium signaling and
its putative phagocytosis alters network dysregulation or epilepsy risk.
The proposed research will enhance the candidate’s experience in using advanced techniques to probe neuronal
circuit function. Such training is directly related to the candidate’s goal of independently studying key glial
pathways and how they influence complex neuronal circuits during epilepsy development. These studies will be
performed at the Mayo Clinic under the supervision of experts in glia (Dr. Long-Jun Wu), epilepsy (Dr. Greg
Worrell and Dr. Peyman Golshani), and miniscope technology (Dr. Luis Lujan and Dr. Peyman Golshani)."
10973591,"Project Summary/Abstract
Background: Relatively few Veterans screening positive for hazardous drinking in primary care (PC) receive
alcohol care in the year following their alcohol screening. This suggests that existing VHA options for linking
Veterans in need of alcohol care, including those with comorbid hazardous drinking and PTSD and/or
depression (A-MH), are not effective. To that end, we have identified and propose to pilot test a promising
evidence-based intervention, Strengths-based Linkage to Alcohol Care (SLAC). SLAC has the potential to
increase linkage to alcohol care, as well as to improve drinking and mental health outcomes, among Veterans
with A-MH in PC.
Significance: Existing VHA options such as VHA-recommended brief alcohol counseling do not improve
linkage to alcohol care, suggesting a critical need for more intensive but practical efforts to link Veterans with
A-MH to care. This proposal directly addresses HSR&D priorities in the areas of Access to Care, Mental Health
(PTSD), and Primary Care by testing a novel approach (SLAC) to linking Veterans with A-MH to VA and non-
VA alcohol care and to improve their drinking and mental health outcomes.
Innovation and Impact: The proposed project is highly innovative because it offers a solution to the critical
gap in VHA care in which most Veterans in need of alcohol care do not receive it. It tests a strategy to increase
linkage to alcohol care that is both intensive enough to produce change, yet feasible to use in busy clinical
settings with too-high demand on too-few staff members. A highly innovative feature of SLAC is that it teaches
PC providers how to link Veterans with A-MH to alcohol care, which may help normalize conversations about
patients’ alcohol use and their care options in PC as part of the provider role. PC providers’ lack of knowledge
on how to treat hazardous drinking is a substantial obstacle to Veterans receiving alcohol care. Additional
unique and innovative features of SLAC are that it uses patients’ self-identified strengths, abilities, and skills to
help them link to an alcohol care option.
Specific Aims: Our two aims are (Aim 1): To adapt SLAC for use among Veterans with A-MH and for delivery
by telephone in the VHA PC setting. We will conduct qualitative interviews with Veterans, PC staff, and our
VACO operational partners to ensure that the content and format of SLAC are adapted so they are relevant
and acceptable to these stakeholders. (Aim 2): To determine (a) the feasibility of conducting a larger scale
randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test SLAC’s effectiveness and (b) SLAC’s acceptability among Veterans
with A-MH in PC, and to explore (c) the efficacy of SLAC in this Veteran population. To achieve Aim 2, we will
conduct a multi-site pilot RCT of SLAC at two VA medical facilities (Little Rock, AR and Palo Alto, CA). To
achieve Aims 2a-b, we will measure the feasibility (e.g., rates of enrollment and follow-up, fidelity to the SLAC
intervention) of conducting a subsequent larger RCT (to test SLAC’s effectiveness) and SLAC’s acceptability
(SLAC completion rates, satisfaction with SLAC) among Veterans. To achieve Aim 2c, we will explore the
efficacy of SLAC to improve Veterans’ linkage to and utilization of alcohol care, and their alcohol and mental
health outcomes, at 3-month follow-up.
Methodology: We will use (Aim 1) qualitative interviews to adapt SLAC for Veterans with A-MH and for PC,
and (Aim 2) conduct a multi-site, pilot RCT. Debriefing interviews with Veterans will follow the pilot RCT.
Next Steps/Implementation: Should our findings justify a subsequent project, we plan to propose a fully
powered, multi-site study, using a Hybrid design, to test SLAC’s clinical effectiveness when delivered in VHA
PC while observing and gathering information on the implementation potential of SLAC in this setting. Our
operations partners are committed to implementing SLAC nationally should it be found to be effective."

 The neural crest (NC) is a stem cell population that originates within the forming central nervous
system. NC cells delaminate from the neuroepithelium by undergoing a spatiotemporally regulated epithelial-to-
mesenchymal transition (EMT) that proceeds in a coordinated wave head-to-tail to exit from the neural tube.
Cranial NC cells, which arise in the head region of the embryo and are the only NC population in vivo with the
ability to differentiate into craniofacial skeleton and cartilage, are indispensable for the development of the face;
mutations affecting NC development result in numerous diseases and malformations affecting the craniofacial
structures (e.g. Treacher Collins syndrome, cleft palate, etc.). Thus, a thorough understanding of the regulation
of cranial NC EMT is essential to identify the etiology of craniofacial abnormalities.
 To date, research has focused on unraveling early events governing cranial NC induction at the neural
plate border and the mechanism of delamination from the neural tube. However, little is known about the
regulatory changes governing the timing of NC EMT and exit from the neural tube. My preliminary studies
demonstrate that a Wnt pathway antagonist, Draxin, plays an important role in controlling the timing of NC
EMT, perturbations of which have negative consequences for cranial NC migration. This role for Draxin is
particularly interesting in light of the fact that the Wnt signaling pathway has been shown to be a major driver of
NC development. The goal of this Proposal is to investigate the molecular mechanism by which Draxin affects
cranial NC EMT, with focus on its role in Wnt signaling. To this end, the Specific Aims of this Proposal seek to
combine chick embryology with state-of-the-art imaging and biochemistry to:
 1) Characterize the interaction of Draxin and Wnt signaling in cranial NC EMT;
 2) Identify the role of Draxin in the regulation of cell adhesion proteins;
 3) Characterize the post-transcriptional regulation of Draxin; and
 4) Identify the role of Draxin in the regulation of extracellular matrix proteins.
 The results of this Proposal will significantly enhance our understanding of the regulation of cranial NC
EMT and migration, providing new scientific avenues for translational research applications in the treatment of
craniofacial defects."
10954667,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Up to half of depressed older adults do not respond to an initial antidepressant, and fewer than 20% achieve
remission. Using a robust multi-site clinical trial network, we have completed two landmark randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) showing that augmentation of current antidepressant with aripiprazole (ARI) or bupropion (BUP)
results in a 29% remission rate in TRLLD. In response to RFA-MH-24-120, we will use this and other existing
clinical trial data to design and evaluate a clinical decision support tool, the Biotype-assigned Augmentation
Approach in Resistant Late-Life Depression (BAARD), to improve treatment selection using precision
biomedical information. With integrated expertise in geroscience, psychopharmacology, cognition, molecular
subtyping, neuroimaging, computational psychiatry, and qualitative research methods represented on our
research team, we will use existing demographic, clinical, cognitive, genetic, proteomic, and high quality
neuroimaging on ~700 participants to develop and test the BAARD tool.
UG3 Phase Specific Aims: Design and Validate the BAARD Decision Support Tool.
Aim 1, Yr 1: Develop the BAARD tool for treatment selection in TRLLD using data from two large multi-center
trials (‘IRL-GRey’ & ‘OPTIMUM’) and the embedded biomarker study (‘OPT-Neuro’) (total N~700).
Aim 2, Yr 2: Refine the BAARD biotype profile & analytic approach using data from individuals diagnosed with
major depressive disorder (MDD) or treatment resistant depression (TRD) from the Canadian Biomarker
Integration Network in Depression (CANBIND, N~200) and UK Biobank (UKB, N~2,400) studies, respectively.
Go-no-go threshold for Yrs 1-2: To proceed to the proposed UH3 RCT phase (N=300), our BAARD tool must
achieve a combined predicted remission rate of ≥46% in cross-validation. This corresponds to a balanced
accuracy of ≥75% for remission prediction in test data and will be assessed at the end of Yr 1 and Yr 2.
UH3 Phase Specific Aims: Test the BAARD Decision Support Tool in a Prospective RCT.
Aim 3, Yrs 3-5: In the UH3 phase, we will randomize 300 adults aged ≥60 yrs with TRLLD (2:1) to BAARD tool-
assigned treatment vs. randomized treatment assignment (1:1 ARI:BUP) and compare remission rates based on
the Montgomery Asberg Rating Scale score (MADRS score<10) following 10 weeks of treatment.
Hypothesis: The remission rate in the group treated with ARI or BUP based on BAARD predictions will be at
least 17% higher than the remission rate observed in the randomly treated comparison group (e.g., 46% vs.
29%).
Go-no-Go threshold for Yrs 3-5: The annual threshold for proceeding with the RCT will be based on participant
enrollment milestones (first by end of Q9; 50% by end of Q12; 100% by end of Q15).
Exploratory Aim, Yrs 4-5: Obtain stakeholder input on acceptability and appropriateness of BAARD and explore
facilitators and barriers to implementation in future clinical trials, and eventually, routine clinical care."
10953800,"Children and youth with special health care needs (CYSHCN)—which include children with chronic conditions
such as Asthma, Autism, Depression, Down Syndrome, or Spina Bifida—are at greater risk of developing
hospital complications following physical trauma. However, the mechanisms behind this elevated risk are
unknown. A major roadblock to uncovering potential mechanisms is a lack of understanding of the family
perspective of the care given to the injured child with special health care needs. Therefore, the proposal
objective is to identify factors contributing to poor care quality such as hospital complications through a
qualitative assessment of the experiences of parents and other family caregivers seeking emergency care for
their injured child with special health care needs. This project will engage families representing a range of
special health care needs to provide their experiences and perspectives of emergency care of injured
CYSHCN, and thus addresses a major roadblock in the field. The central hypothesis is that a lack of timely,
integrated, anticipatory, and accommodating care as reported by family caregivers will negatively affect injury
outcomes in CYSHCN. This hypothesis will be examined through the following specific aim: Assess family
caregiver experiences seeking emergency care for injured CYSHCN. In this aim, a demographic questionnaire
will be paired with a semi-structured interview guide to collect qualitative data from family caregivers of
CYSHCN. At least 35 family caregivers will be surveyed and interviewed, consisting of a purposive sample
representing physical, developmental, and behavioral/emotional special health care needs. In addition to local
recruitment, the study team will partner with two organizations that have a national reach to ensure diversity in
recruited family caregivers. The data will be analyzed using a rapid analysis approach, where both inductive
and deductive modalities will be employed. The proposed research is innovative because it focuses on injury
as the reason for CYSHCN accessing emergency care and incorporates the family caregiver voice. The
proposed research is significant because successful completion of this project will elucidate the mechanisms
behind adverse outcomes in injured CYSHCN, where the family caregiver-identified factors in the R03 will
complement the provider-identified factors from the current KL2 project. Together with the KL2, this R03 will
inform interventions for R21 and R01 proposals to improve emergency health care delivery for injured
CYSHCN. As a result, it will support the PI to transition to a fully independent academic translational scientist."
10954001,"Project Summary – Through 170 years of bile acid (BA) chemistry research, our knowledge of
mammalian BA conjugation was limited to the amino acids glycine and taurine. Our group recently
discovered that the gut microbiome can also conjugate BAs with a wide variety of amino acids, which
has changed our fundamental understanding of BA biochemistry. These compounds are called
‘microbially conjugated bile acids’ (MCBAs), they are common in humans, particularly those with
inflammatory bowel disease, and are at similar concentrations to other host-produced BAs making them
physiologically relevant. Furthermore, we recently discovered they are made by unrecognized
transferase activity of the bacterial enzyme bile salt hydrolase (BSH/T), which itself has been studied
for decades. Here we will explore how MCBAs are made by the microbiome and how their signaling
properties can alter disease outcomes in a mouse model of gut inflammation.
 In our preliminary data, we show myriad gut bacteria produce MCBAs and we have evidence
that there is selective pressure on the BSH/T for its acyl-transfer properties. In controlled murine and
cell culture experiments, we show that MCBAs agonize gut BA receptors such as FXR and TGR5, which
can alter inflammatory signaling properties in gut epithelial cells. Analysis of human samples shows that
MCBAs are at physiologically relevant concentrations in the gut and can enter circulation. Therefore,
we believe MCBAs contribute to host-microbiome crosstalk with potential implications for gut health.
We also show that BA conjugation by the host is important for overall health in the mouse DSS-model
of gut inflammation. This proposal will therefore test the hypothesis that MCBAs alter can alter disease
outcomes in the DSS-model due to their bioactivity which is dependent on the specific amino acid
conjugated. We will use a diverse approach including microbiology, cell receptor assays, and a knockout
mouse model that lacks host-BA conjugation to understand the role of these compounds in GI health.
 We have three principle aims: 1) Define the microbiology of MCBA production and their
resistance to subsequent hydrolysis, 2) Determine their agonist activity on the ileal receptor FXR in vitro
and in vivo, and 3) Show that MCBAs affect outcomes in the DSS-model of GI inflammation using BA
conjugation knockout and wildtype mice. Michigan State provides all the resources needed to complete
the project and the PI has assembled an integrative team with broad expertise. This project will explore
the basic science of MCBAs creating a platform for research on their impacts on human health. If we
can better understand the signaling and physiological role of MCBAs they could be developed as drugs
to treat myriad GI diseases. Results from this project will further emphasize the importance of the
chemical crosstalk between us and our microbiome for maintaining human health."
10954120,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 It has now been two decades since the clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR) criteria were first
formulated in service of the goal of preventing psychotic disorders, one of the most urgent unmet clinical
needs in behavioral health if not in all of medicine. As with most psychiatric patients, CHR patients benefit
from psychotherapies but are also often left with important treatment needs not fully addressed. Despite
the critical public health need, drug development for CHR is viewed in many quarters as risky. The
Foundation for the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Mental Health along with other
public and private partners established the Psychosis Risk Outcomes Network (ProNET) and the
Accelerating Medicines Partnership® Schizophrenia Observational Study (AMP® SCZ) in 2020 to develop
tools to parse the heterogeneity of the CHR syndrome and de-risk the drug development that could lead
to improvement of symptoms and functioning in CHR patients and ultimately to the prevention of
schizophrenia. The current project, the Psychosis Risk Outcomes Compound Assessment Network
(ProCAN), follows up on this successful previous initiative and will establish infrastructure to determine, in
partnership with the Clinical Trials Data Processing Analysis and Coordination Center (CT-DPACC),
whether the biological, digital, cognitive, and clinical outcome measures developed in AMP SCZ are
viable as drug development tools (DDTs) for use in Phase 2 clinical trials in participants at clinical high
risk for psychosis (CHR). One or two Phase 2-ready compounds will be studied, each selected by the
AMP SCZ Compound Selection Committee. Aim 1 will evaluate the potential of selected compound(s) to
detect a signal in CHR participants on one or more biological, digital, cognitive, or clinical outcome
measures developed in the AMP SCZ Observational Study within a 16 week time frame. We propose two
trials, each with 15 sites, each with three arms and 65 participants per arm (total per trial N=195), and
each with the Network RFA specified maximum 16 week follow-up. Compound safety will also be
evaluated. Aim 2 will determine whether biomarkers developed in the AMP SCZ Observational Study
and/or novel biomarkers can act as pharmacodynamic readouts of drug response and/or provide insights
into proposed mechanisms or pathways underlying CHR for psychosis. We propose biomarker timepoints
at baseline and 8 and 16 weeks. If outcome or biomarker signals are detected, findings will pave the way
for further development of phase-specific and safe new interventions to benefit CHR patients and their
families and communities."
10954561,"In response to the escalating opioid crisis in the United States, there is an urgent need for effective intervention strategies. Opioid overdoses can induce dangerous respiratory depression, leading to critical hypoxia and potential mortality. Current harm reduction measures include the provision of naloxone to drug users, their supporters, and first responders to swiftly counteract opioid effects. However, these interventions may be insufficient given that more than half of opioid-induced fatalities occur at home, often unwitnessed. To address this urgent public health issue, BioSensics and Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) present ODAlert—an innovative wearable device designed to detect and alert users and first responders of potential opioid overdoses. Affixed to the user's abdomen via a biocompatible patch, ODAlert continually monitors respiratory patterns, issuing an auditory alarm and contacting first responders upon detection of respiratory cessation. As initial steps for developing ODAlert, we performed stakeholder interviews with 10 adults with opioid use disorder (OUD) and 10 clinical experts who treat OUD to guide the design of ODAlert such as sensor placement, form factor, and functionality. Based on these surveys, an optimal sensor was identified; namely, a wearable device affixed to the user's abdomen via a biocompatible patch. We developed algorithms for detection of respiratory cessation using a reference wearable device on the abdomen with over 92% sensitivity and specificity in a 10-adult pilot study. Moreover, we submitted a Pre-submission request to the FDA (Q222234) and received feedback about the clinical validation study design to support a De Novo application for ODAlert. Encouraged by these initial results, we are now applying for Blueprint funding to facilitate development, clinical validation, market readiness, FDA approval and commercialization of ODAlert. In Phase I, we will complete the development of ODAlert sensor, optimize battery, deploy real-time algorithms, and secure IDE and IRB approval. In Phase II, we will complete the development of ODAlert and its mobile app, conduct a clinical validation study with opioid- experienced adults (n=30) via a cross-over randomized study, and also evaluate ODAlert's performance in a 6- week study on adults (n=60) with OUD for submission as a part of the De Novo application to the FDA. ODAlert can have significant multiple-level impact: 1) Public health: It introduces a warning system for opioid overdoses, aiming to reduce mortality rates; 2) Technological innovation: ODAlert represents a leap in wearable healthcare tech, inspiring potential life-saving devices; 3) Policy and regulatory: Securing FDA approval for ODAlert can inform policy around wearable-based health devices and set a precedent; 4) Clinical practice: If widely accepted, ODAlert will transform care standards for overdose-prone patients; 5) Patient self-management: ODAlert can empower individuals with OUD by providing a tool to manage their condition and heighten overdose awareness, potentially enhancing health outcomes; and 6) Future Research: The study could foster new research directions in wearable health technology, like an automatic naloxone injection system."

This is a pathfinder project that will begin by developing a prototype of a dashboard for routine
outcomes monitoring in psychotherapy and mental health clinics in the two hospitals. The
feasibility study will be carried out in Kisumu and Nairobi in public health clinics.
Our specific aims include mapping of the effectiveness of psychotherapy as practiced in regular
clinical practice at key sites in Kenya, in general and for specific diagnostic subgroups. This aim
will be realized by implementing a Routine Outcome Monitoring system (ROM). Such systems
have been used in other parts of the world, and are known to improve treatment effectiveness.
Other sub-aims include:
Aim 1 To adapt and extend the develop a contextualized prototype ofMarBar ROM system
developed in Ecuador to Kisumu and Nairobi in Kenya
Aim 2 To test feasibility, cost, efficacy and sustainability of the use of MarBar-Africa over 6
months pathfinder pilot in two clinics in Nairobi and Kisumu
Aim 3 To carry out an exploratory analysis of the trajectories of distress, improvement of
functioning and quality of life of study participants to identify characteristics of patients and
treatments of those who are successfully remitted from those not.
The information gained from the project will be used for optimizing treatment of mental disorders
in Kenya and strengthen regional Kenyan public hospital partnerships. A long-term aim is to
develop sustainable clinical excellence demonstration sites in Kenya and other neighboring East
African countries, developing and testing methods that will be continually informed and refined
by empirical data collected at these sites. Our group has previously done successful pilot
research at two sites in Nairobi, Kenya, that has generated several publications in renowned
international journals and useful information to clinics and patients. The feasibility of the project
will be ensured by our group’s extensive and broad knowledge of psychotherapy research,
clinical psychology, psychiatry, implementation science, and of local contexts in both counties.
We believe the project has the potential of providing information that will be immediately useful
to clinicians and patients at the studied sites, and in the long run to patients throughout the Sub-
Saharan African continent."
10954406,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Malaria morbidity and mortality rates have rebounded in recent years and threaten to further increase,
as a predicted consequence of the recent emergence and spread in east Africa of Plasmodium
falciparum (Pf) strains resistant to first-line artemisinin (ART) derivatives. ART resistance is likely to
increase selective pressure on the partner drugs used in ART-based combination therapy, as evidenced
in Uganda where parasites are also displaying decreased susceptibility to the first-line partner drug,
lumefantrine. Recent data suggest that the dissemination of ART-resistant strains across sub-Saharan
Africa will require mutations in the primary determinant k13 as well as additional determinants that can
augment resistance and overcome fitness costs associated with mutant k13. To identify these
determinants, we genetically crossed a drug-sensitive African parasite with an ART-resistant parasite
from Southeast Asia, where resistance arose a decade earlier. By comparing the genome sequences
and ART susceptibility profiles of recombinant progeny, we associated ART resistance with mutant k13
and two additional, physically unlinked loci. In Aim 1, we propose to test the role of the prioritized
candidates mrp1 and arps10, by CRISPR/Cas9 editing their mutations into the ART-resistant parent
and several African culture-adapted strains. We will then assess their ability to mitigate mutant k13’s
fitness costs, thus enabling ART-resistant parasites to successfully compete with drug-sensitive strains
and disseminate throughout African parasite populations. We will also assess the contribution of other
genes implicated from in vitro or small animal model studies. In Aim 2, we will define the multigenic
basis of Pf resistance to quinine, a former first-line drug that represents a viable alternative to
intravenous artesunate for the management of severe malaria in regions where ART resistance
becomes prevalent. Candidate physically unlinked genes, including dmt1, a putative transporter related
to pfcrt, as well as ftsh1 and samc, have been identified from a second genetic cross involving an Asian
quinine-resistant parasite and a sensitive African strain. In Aim 3, we will leverage preliminary data to
explore Pf resistance to ZY-19489 and MMV688533, two promising antimalarial candidates in clinical
trials. We will also assess the resistance risks of the registered drugs lumefantrine and pyronaridine
where the knowledge gap is acute, as well as ferroquine and INE963 that are in clinical trials. These
experiments, which take advantage of our unique panel of hyper-mutable African and Asian strains, will
identify which of these candidate therapeutics are resistance-refractory. Achieving the goals of our
project will yield important insights into the multigenic basis of ART and quinine resistance, deliver novel
molecular markers to track the dissemination of multidrug-resistant Pf malaria, and inform the
development of future therapeutics."
10973000,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Subsidies for contraception and even the right to use contraception are often justified on the basis of their
benefits to women’s socioeconomic lives. While the benefits of expanding contraceptive access have been
documented, reductions in access are now under consideration. Because reductions in access operate
differently than expansions, they will not simply reverse the effects of expansions. Therefore, it is critical to
understand how such reductions impact women’s social and economic outcomes.
This project uses newly-developed data and one of the earliest and largest reductions in access to
contraception to generate the first estimates of reduced contraceptive access in the US.
The project will estimate the causal impact of reduced access to contraception using a massive policy
experiment in Texas. In 2011, Texas decreased its grant-based contraceptive funding program by 2/3 and
deprioritized dedicated family planning providers. These actions caused clinic closures, reduced access to the
most effective methods, and were associated with increases in teen fertility.
In partnership with the U.S. Census Bureau, the project will (Aim 1A) expand an individual-level longitudinal
dataset, Reproduction in People’s Lives (RIPL), recording women’s fertility and human capital formation for
nearly all reproductive-age U.S. women 2000-2026. RIPL links restricted individual-level microdata for the
entire United States from the Census Numident, Master Address File–Auxiliary Reference File, three decennial
Censuses, individual IRS tax filings, the Census Household Composition Key, and the 2005-2026 American
Community Survey. The project will also (Aim 1B) integrate original survey-based and administrative clinic-
level data on the spatial intensity of Texas reductions in contraceptive access into RIPL. And importantly, the
project will (Aim 1C) yield a modular version of RIPL, so researchers on Census Bureau-approved projects
can use our documented code to construct components of RIPL for replication, extension, and their own use.
Changes in life course outcomes as Texans experienced reductions in access contraception will be compared
to changes in comparison states using a difference-in-differences approach. In this way the project will (Aim 2)
assess the impact of reductions in access to contraception on women’s fertility over their life course. Similarly,
the project will (Aim 3) assess the impact of reductions in access to contraception on women’s economic
outcomes and human capital accumulation. For each outcome, whether impacts vary by age at exposure,
family of origin socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity, as well as whether fertility mediates the impact of
reduced access (Aim 4) on women’s socioeconomic lives will be assessed.
Project findings will inform ongoing debates over the causal effects of access to contraception and fertility
timing on socioeconomic outcomes. The data and methods developed may also be used by researchers on
other approved projects to investigate the life course in ways previously prevented by data limitations."
10973062,"Summary
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed non-skin cancer in American men. A majority of localized
PCa can be effectively managed by radiation and surgery, with a 5-year survival rate of over 99%. However,
resistance to frontline treatment inevitably develops, leading to castration-resistant PCa (CRPC), with a median
survival of only 4-6 years. EZH2 is a Polycomb group protein that constitutes the Polycomb Repressive Complex
2 (PRC2) along with two other core subunits, SUZ12 and EED. EZH2 is among the most up-regulated genes in
CRPC and a well-established therapeutic target. EZH2 depletion leads to cellular senescence and abolishes
PCa growth. EZH2, when in the PRC2 complex, methylates histone 3 lysine 27 and several recently reported
non-histone substrates, leading to PCa progression. These functions of PRC2-EZH2 could be blocked by
enzymatic EZH2 inhibitors, such as EPZ-6438. However, enzymatic EZH2 inhibitors have limited growth-
inhibitory effects in PCa. Accordingly, recent studies have revealed the non-enzymatic roles of EZH2 in activating
target genes such as AR. This function is independent of PRC2 and is rather mediated by coactivators such as
P300 and c-Myc. A number of PROTACs have been recently developed, hoping to degrade all EZH2 proteins.
Unfortunately, these PROTACs remained largely ineffective, as they were mostly derived from enzymatic EZH2
inhibitors, which were shown only able to bind EZH2 in the trimeric PRC2 complex and thus unable to degrade
non-PRC2 EZH2. Addressing this significantly unaddressed gap, we propose to develop a series of PROTACs
using the first small molecule that we have identified that binds isolated EZH2 protein (solo EZH2). We propose
that these solo-EZH2 PROTACs will degrade newly synthesized EZH2 proteins, ultimately disassociating all
EZH2 complexes and fully blocking EZH2 functions. We will test their targets and efficacy in PCa models. We
will also use the PROTACs to dissect out the catalytic and non-catalytic roles of EZH2 in various stages of PCa.
Ultimately, we will optimize lead compounds in terms of favorable pharmacokinetics and toxicity profiles, having
a significant and near-term impact on the development of new treatment strategies for prostate and other cancers."
10973135,"ABSTRACT
Adults 60 years and older are the fastest growing subpopulation of patients with inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD), and are soon forecasted to represent >1 million individuals living in the U.S with IBD. The mainstay of
therapy for older adults with IBD is biologic therapy, but when these agents fail, surgery is required. Overall,
despite the growing armamentarium of biologic therapies, more than 20% of older adults with IBD will
ultimately require surgery. Further, surgical emergency and complication rates among older adults with IBD are
twice as high as compared to younger adults with IBD, with mortality rates reported as ten-fold higher. This, in
part, is due to an initial deferral of surgery, given the higher perceived risk of an adverse operative outcome
associated with increasing chronological age. Paradoxically, however, this delay can contribute to the
heightened surgical risk observed by increasing time on corticosteroids, and by leading to prolonged periods of
inflammation and malnutrition, which can precipitate physiologic and cognitive decline among older adults. In
order to shift the age-old practice of deferring surgical treatment due to chronological age alone, we aim to
address three critical knowledge gaps in the field: (1) Derive and validate a model predicting which older adults
with IBD will ultimately require disease-related surgery; (2) Derive a preoperative model predicting risk of a
major adverse postoperative event (we will include measures of sarcopenia, cognition, and malnutrition); and
(3) Identify patient and clinician barriers that contribute to surgical delays among older adults with IBD. In order
to complete this work, we have developed a mentorship team that has complementary expertise in aging-
related research, geriatric and surgical care, risk modeling, qualitative analyses, decision support, and career
development. This team, coupled with the rich environment in which this work will be completed, will help the
candidate meet his career goals: (1) Develop expertise in aging-related research and geriatric care; (2) Learn
advanced statistical modeling; (3) Obtain formal training in qualitative and mixed methods analysis; and (4)
Apply for and obtain R01 grant funding. In all, by identifying who is likely to need surgery, what preoperative
factors contribute to the risk of surgical complications, and which barriers exist for surgical care among older
adults with IBD, we can shift current practice and reduce delays when surgery is required. This can improve
outcomes for thousands of older adults with IBD, and help identify avenues for future intervention."
10973137,"SUMMARY
The central concept in this project is that exposure of existing estrogen receptor (ER) and
progesterone (PR) positive (ER+/PR+) breast tumors to heavy metal pollutants promotes the
emergence of tumor cells that lack PR expression and function. While ER+/PR+ breast cancer
have excellent prognosis and respond well to treatments, ER+/PR- do not and often progress to
high lethal recurrent metastatic disease. Hence, we propose that environmental arsenic, lead or
mixtures of these metals present in particulate air pollution and water supplies, poses a grave risk
for the successful treatment of women with ER+/PR+ breast cancer via promoting the
reprogramming of these tumors to ER+/PR- phenotypes. In addition, we found that phenotypic
reprogramming by heavy metals involves changes in the cellular nuclear redox state. As reactive
oxygen species (ROS) increase in the nucleus, vastly because of heavy-metal induced
mitochondrial dysfunction, progesterone receptor gene expression is suppressed unleashing
phenotypic reprogramming. We also found that quenching these ROS at the origin (mitochondria)
or the nucleus (site of activity) reverses the suppression of PR expression by iAs and Pb and to
a large extent resensitizes metal-transformed breast cancer cells to the anti-neoplastic action of
first line selective estrogen receptor modulators, often the most accessible therapy for low income
and minority populations. Since, we now have FDA-approved, as well as, novel proprietary
compounds to suppress nuclear ROS in tumor cells, this strategy may lead to much needed
adjuvant therapies to mitigate some of the most devastating health effects of heavy metal
contaminants affecting most heavily low income and minority breast cancer patients. Therefore
the goals of this project are: 1) Determine how nuclear ROS-driven epigenetic reprogramming
impacts ER+/PR+ tumor transitions to treatment refractory ER+/PR- phenotypes; 2) Determine if
suppressing ROS in the nucleus restores treatment effectiveness in xenograft tumor models of
metal-transformed cells; 3) Determine if FDA-approved pharmacologic mitochondrial ROS
scavengers are effective in resensitizing metal-transformed tumor cells to chemotherapy."

This application validates a minimally invasive, multi-stage artificial intelligence (AI)-based cytologic, histologic and
epigenetic biomarker to identify oral premalignant lesions (OPL) with high risk of progression to oral cavity squamous cell
carcinoma (OSCC), using a massive existing data set and a prospective study in racially and socioeconomically diverse OPL
patients. OSCC patients suffer from a 5-year mortality rate of 40%, accounting for one death per hour. Up to 10% of the
U.S. population has oral lesions, of which a small proportion are high-risk OPLs that transform to OSCC. Major challenges
exist in monitoring and risk stratifying these OPLs. While grade is used to recommend treatment, its prognostic value is low.
There is currently no reliable clinical, histologic or molecular marker to determine individual risk in patients with the same
dysplasia grade. The quality of OPL grading in hematoxylin eosin (HE) stained slides is based on the availability of a
surgeon and pathologist, typically absent in resource-constrained locations. Currently, noninvasive sampling that can be
used in settings with restricted access to care, have not been validated to replace tissue diagnosis. Herein we design a staged
approach to diagnosing and monitoring OPLs, using cytology, histology, and epigenomics in a step-wise fashion in order to
minimize diagnostic invasiveness. Our approach will automate and improve prognostication of OPL risk by using deep
learning. Our central hypothesis is that histologic and molecular patterns within OPLs can be risk-stratified using deep
learning to individualize prognosis in patients with the same apparent OPL grade. We test our hypothesis through a series
of scientific aims, which taken together, create a paradigm shift in management of OPLs by establishing a layered strategy
that escalates the complexity of the diagnostic test (from brush swabs to surgical biopsy) with escalating cancer risk. Our
study proceeds with the following 3 aims. 1) Train deep learning based digital pathology models for oral premalignant
lesion progression risk prediction. We will use a longitudinal cohort with known cancer outcomes to train deep learning
models using cytology and histology, respectively, to predict risk of progression to OSCC. 2) Validate and merge cytology
and histology with epigenomic signatures to create the multi-stage, multi-modal PROSPECT score using multiple cohorts.
We will refine the digital cytology and histology biomarkers in a separate existing validation cohort with known cancer
outcomes. Next, we will use brush swabs to predict biologically relevant epigenomic alterations in the transition from OPL
to OSCC. We will create the PROSPECT score (Premalignant Oral Lesions Pathology and Epigenetic Risk Prediction Tool),
which is a risk score that combines the cytologic, histologic, and epigenetic scores sequentially with clinical information to
predict risk of cancer progression. 3) Test the PROSPECT score in a prospective, multi-institutional clinical study of OPL
patients enrolled in geographically and racially diverse populations. We will refine our PROSPECT score to perform
robustly in brush biopsies and tissues from a separate prospective cohort of OPL patients, which will be recruited during the
course of this study from four clinical sites, where the patient populations possess diversity in race, socioeconomics, and
health disparities indices. Testing of the PROSPECT score in this prospective cohort will set the stage for a large-scale
clinical study to use non-invasive brush swabs to monitor OPL with higher accuracy than current clinical standards."
10973053,"SUMMARY
Opioids are the most widely used analgesics but are also heavily abused substances. Their adverse actions
include peripheral side effects, dependence and tolerance which severely limit utility of opioid analgesics for
long term pain management. The µ-opioid receptor (MOR) is the primary target of opioid analgesia, addiction,
and withdrawal. Thus, efforts to develop safer opioid treatments as well as manage addiction and withdrawal
will require a much deeper understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms that regulate MOR
signaling and trafficking.
 Our long-term goal is to use unbiased forward genetics to dissect the MOR signaling network using
behavioral responses to opioids as a phenotypic readout. Towards this goal, we deploy a transgenic MOR
(tgMOR) model where mammalian MOR is expressed in the C. elegans nervous system. This imbues C.
elegans with opioid-sensitive behaviors. Importantly, tgMOR animals exhibit the behavioral hallmarks of opioid
responses in mammals including acute depressant effects, desensitization, and tolerance. We previously used
forward genetics and the tgMOR C. elegans model to discover two novel regulators of MOR signaling: 1) The
GPR139 orphan receptor and 2) the Ptchd1 receptor. Importantly, GPR139 and Ptdhd1 regulate opioid
sensitivity and tolerance from C. elegans through rodents. Thus, our strategy has revealed major new players
in MOR signaling, and we are uniquely positioned to break further new ground in opioid receptor biology.
 Our goal for the next funding period is to build on our success by continuing to identify novel
regulators of opioid signaling while performing deep mechanistic studies on validated gene candidates.
Towards this goal, our first aim focuses on using forward genetics and the tgMOR C. elegans model to identify
new genetic players that affect opioid drug responsivity and MOR signaling. We focus on two principal
phenotypic categories of tgMOR mutants, opioid hypersensitive and hyposensitive mutants. We plan to pursue
and fully validate a subset of mutants from each phenotypic category. To demonstrate the conserved nature of
potential candidates, we deploy two complementary approaches: an engineered yeast model of MOR
signaling, and mammalian cell-based MOR signaling assays. In the second aim, we pivot to deep mechanistic
studies with two players that we identified as regulators of MOR-mediated behavior using forward genetics with
C. elegans. We deploy a combination of targeted C. elegans genetics, and a comprehensive battery of cell-
based assays to monitor MOR trafficking and various aspects of MOR signaling. The third aim pivots to begin
addressing the molecular landscape of how MOR interconnects with other GPCR signaling networks. We aim
to build upon our success with the tgMOR C. elegans model by developing new engineered models of GPCR
signaling in C. elegans. Moreover, we plan to deploy unbiased, forward genetics to interrogate opioid-related
GPCRs for the first time in any system."

The COVID-19 pandemic poses a sustained threat to the wellbeing of all children, but particularly for low-
income, racially minoritized, and special needs subgroups. This unpredictable, complex, racialized crisis has
exposed millions of children to massive disruptions of their educational contexts when schools closed, with
growing accounts of associated learning loss, social isolation, and emotional distress. Scholars have mobilized
to study the pandemic, yet much of this emerging research draws on small, relatively homogeneous (mostly
white) samples, limiting applicability to the subgroups most affected by this pandemic and its multisystem
disruptions (e.g., Latinx [including ELL]; Black; children with special needs). Little of this new research contains
extensive, repeated measures of pre-COVID-19 child functioning. Nor does it capture the multisystem
culturally-embedded protective factors likely to influence short- and longer-term developmental recovery for the
current US child population. Thus, there is an urgent need for culturally-relevant, longitudinal research
spanning the period from before the pandemic and continuing, on diverse samples of children to inform current
and future pandemic preparation and response efforts. The proposed project fills this gap by capturing
children’s pre-k-1st grade pre-pandemic functioning and following them through - and well beyond - the period
of widespread quarantines and school closures, as they enter adolescence. Leveraging data from an existing,
ongoing, large, highly diverse sample of low-income students in Title I schools who have been followed since
they were preschoolers in 2016, the proposed study will (Aim 1a) determine the impacts of COVID-19
disruptions when schools were closed on children’s short-term outcomes in the years immediately following
school reopening (3rd-5th grade); (Aim 1b) investigate how short-term outcomes are exacerbated or mitigated
by individual differences in children’s pre-COVID-19 strengths and vulnerabilities; (Aim 2a) explore the longer-
term impacts of disruption on development by adding repeated measurement of children’s outcomes in the
longer term following school reopening, through 9th grade; and (2b) identify the most potent features of
children’s post-school-reopening family, school, and peer contexts – including culturally-embedded family
factors – that mitigate the longer-term impacts (through 9th grade) of COVID-19 disruption on recovery of
consequential early adolescent outcomes, including mental health. By determining effects of educational and
family-based disruptions during school closures, and family disruptions that continue after schools reopened,
on varying developmental trajectories, and identifying culturally-embedded protective factors, this project
moves well beyond identifying risk groups to specifying shared and unique aspects of children’s family, school,
and peer contexts that promote long-term resilience in a highly diverse sample. It thus holds tremendous
promise for advancing knowledge to improve public health and inform current and future disaster preparation,
relief, and recovery efforts tailored to children especially susceptible to negative outcomes."
10974565,"Groundwater contamination with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is a widespread issue throughout the
United States. Over 50% of more than 3500 groundwater samples collected from 98 major drinking water
supply aquifers from 1985-2001 contained at least one anthropogenic contaminant, with VOCs detected
most frequently. Among the top 15 VOCs detected, eight were chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs):
chloroform (CF), perchloroethylene (PCE), trichloroethylene (TCE), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA),
cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (cis-DCE), trans-1,2-dichloroethylene (trans-DCE), dichloromethane (DCM),
and 1,1-dichloroethane (1,1-DCA). All of these CAHs are listed by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention as being likely human carcinogens. Of increasing concern are emerging co-contaminants, such
as 1,4-dioxane (1,4-D), which is also a likely human carcinogen. Common remediation techniques, such
as pump-and-treat, are not sustainable for treating contaminant mixtures that slowly diffuse from low
permeability zones in the subsurface. These issues highlight the need for long-term, passive, and
economical remediation techniques.
Passive and sustainable systems are proposed for the aerobic cometabolism of emerging contaminants, such
as 1,4-D, that are mixed with CAHs. These passive systems will be created by co-encapsulating axenic
bacterial cultures with a slow release compound (SRC) in hydrogel beads. The SRC will slowly hydrolyze
in the beads to produce an alcohol, which will serve as a microbial growth substrate and as an inducer for
non-specific contaminant-degrading monooxygenases. Groundwater contaminants will diffuse into the
hydrogels where they will be cometabolically transformed to non-toxic products. In preliminary studies,
the alkane-oxidizing bacterium Rhodococcus rhodochrous ATCC 21198 was co-encapsulated with an
orthosilicate SRC in a gellan gum hydrogel. Continuous degradation of 1,1,1-TCA, cis-DCE, and 1,4-D
was maintained for over 300 days. In the proposed work, proteomic analyses of this model bacterium will
be performed to identify the active monooxygenases and to characterize the enzymatic and physiological
changes that ultimately limit the long-term activity of this bacterium in the encapsulated systems. Genome-
enabled approaches will also be used to rationally identify other microorganisms with different
monooxygenase compliments that can also be co-encapsulated with SRCs to achieve the degradation of a
broad range of emerging contaminants. Material science research will determine how to produce hydrogels
beads that maintain mechanical integrity for extended periods, focusing on processes that can be easily
scaled-up for producing large quantities of beads needed for in-situ treatment. The beads will then be used
in different platforms at the laboratory scale to create passive permeable reactive barriers. The hydrogel
beads might also be used for treating contaminated soils and sediments and other emerging contaminants."

Development fashions 1011 neurons in the brain that form 1014 tightly regulated synaptic connections which un-
derlie cognition and emotion. Numerous neuropsychiatric diseases arise from even small genetic perturbations
or environmental insults affecting synapse development, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizo-
phrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and intellectual disability. Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (A-
GPCRs) are the second largest and least understood GPCR family. They play critical roles in brain development
and function and are increasingly linked to human disease, lending urgency to their study, especially given their
untapped potential as therapeutic targets. A-GPCRs are characterized by an extracellular N-terminal fragment
(NTF) containing multiple adhesion domains, a GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, and a C-terminal
fragment (CTF) that includes a 7-transmembrane GPCR domain and an intracellular tail. Most A-GPCRs
undergo GAIN-mediated autoproteolytic cleavage, resulting in non-covalently associated NTF/CTF hetero-
dimers. In the last decade, autoagonistic ‘Stachel sequences’ were discovered just C-terminal to the GAIN cut
sites, giving rise to a ‘canonical’ A-GPCR activation model, in which ligand binding causes NTF/CTF dissociation,
unveiling Stachel, which binds and activates the GPCR. However, this model does not apply to all A-GPCR
signaling, because A-GPCRs have additional signal domains, and GAIN cleavage, Stachel activation, and GPCR
signaling may or may not be utilized in a given A-GPCR signal. We study the BAI A-GPCR subfamily (BAI1-3),
whose members are expressed throughout the brain and regulate a growing list of neuronal processes, including
excitatory synaptogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and axon/dendrite growth. In this proposal, we will test the contri-
butions of BAIs, particularly BAI1, to diverse aspects of excitatory synapse regulation, including (1) presynaptic
development and function, (2) postsynaptic stabilization and plasticity, and (3) activity-dependent refinement of
hippocampal synapses in brain circuits important for learning and memory. For each process, we will elucidate
BAI1’s mechanism of action to test our hypothesis that BAIs sense specific cellular and molecular cues and relay
this information to distinct Rho GTPase signaling pathways, thereby directing different facets of synaptic
development and function independently. As other A-GPCR subfamilies exhibit functional clustering, we will also
consider the roles of BAI2 and 3 in these processes to test whether this is a common feature of A-GPCRs. This
proposal tackles complex signaling pathways to answer basic questions of A-GPCR biology, reveal key
mechanisms of neurodevelopment and function, and build a framework for testing the potential of BAIs (and
other A-GPCRs) as therapeutic targets by illuminating how they can be targeted to manipulate specific processes
among the many they govern. As BAIs are implicated in ASD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, cognitive ability,
mood regulation, and brain cancer, our results could advance understanding of these disorders."

Asymmetric transition metal catalysis has proven time and time again to be a crucial strategy in the
pharmaceutical industry. The development of novel methods for accessing common organic scaffolds with
improvements in the areas of atom-economy and selectivity has supported the mass production of valuable drug
molecules. Hydroacylation is a powerful catalytic tool in which a hydrogen and an acyl group are added across
a site of unsaturation via transition metal catalysis. This has the potential to be useful in the construction of
carbonyl motifs for synthetic drug discovery. Azetidines are four-membered cyclic amines that can be found in
drug candidates and natural products such as Nicotianamine and Ximelagatran. Our goal, described herein, is
to explore the potential for a Rh-catalyzed asymmetric hydroacylation of azetines to generate novel azetidine
scaffolds. Switching the ligand of choice, chiral Josiphos versus 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane dppe, allows
a regiodivergent strategy for the construction of chiral azetidines and achiral compounds. Building off of this
work, we also aim to develop further hydroacylation methods to gain access to several other strained ring
systems, which have been found to provide favorable structural and physicochemical properties necessary for
molecular optimization in modern medicinal chemistry."
10973506,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The number of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease or Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) in
the U.S. is projected to increase to 9 million by 2030 (from 6.7 million in 2023). Approximately 1 million of these
individuals will identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or another sexual or gender minority
(SGM). SGM older adults have fewer options for informal (unpaid) care as they are more likely be single, live
alone, and be kin-less, often relying on chosen care contributors—those who provide direct care or who
contribute financially to dementia care. SGM older adults also experience greater financial hardship than their
non-SGM peers due to disparities in earnings, fewer opportunities to build savings, and limited access to social
and legal programs. A diagnosis of AD/ADRD can not only be emotionally devastating for persons living with
dementia (PLWD) and their care contributors, but also financially devastating, as AD/ADRD is often cited as
the most expensive disease in the world, with the majority of the financial burden falling to PLWD and their
care contributors. As financial hardship is associated with worse mental and physical health outcomes and
lower health-related quality of life, SGM PLWD—who have been historically marginalized and already
experience disproportionate health and financial inequities—are at even greater risk for adverse
consequences. Taken together, SGM PLWD and their care contributors may represent a previously overlooked
priority population who are especially vulnerable to greater financial hardship and subsequent negative health
outcomes compared to their non-SGM peers, indicating the need to screen and prioritize interventions for this
group. However, no validated measures exist to assess financial hardship in the context of AD/ADRD nor
among SGM PLWD who may have unique support networks involving families of choice. This project will
address the need for an inclusive measure of AD/ADRD-related financial hardship (Inclusive Screener for
AD/ADRD Financial Expenses or I-SAFE) for use by care contributors to SGM and non-SGM PLWD.
Developing and psychometrically validating an inclusive measure of financial hardship in the context of
AD/ADRD will lay the groundwork for future intervention studies designed to reduce financial and health
inequities among SGM (an NIH-designated health disparities population) and non-SGM PLWD and their care
contributors. By incorporating one or more care contributors—which attends to the specific disease trajectory
of AD/ADRD—and expanding the concept of family to include non-kin care contributors, I-SAFE will further the
current measurement of financial hardship and be inclusive enough to capture the unique needs of SGM
PLWD and their care contributors. With projections regarding increasing numbers of older adults (SGM and
non-SGM) with AD/ADRD, growing diversity of the population, and rising costs of healthcare, this study has the
potential to make a significant impact on the lives of SGM and non-SGM PLWD and their care contributors."

Title: Insulin regulates aging-associated genes through chromatin topology
 Insulin signaling plays an important role in controlling metabolic homeostasis, with its dysregulation
linked to various metabolic diseases associated with aging, including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity.
Inhibiting insulin signaling has been shown to prolong lifespan and postpone aging-associated diseases across
various animal species. However, the mechanism by which insulin activity controls aging and related metabolic
syndromes remain unclear. In mouse liver, a significant portion of insulin-regulated genes are associated with
aging. Among them, the expression level of Tmtc2 (transmembrane and tetratricopeptide repeat containing
protein 2), a novel Ca2+ regulator, significantly declines with aging, insulin treatment and insulin-associated
metabolic conditions. This project has three objectives.
 1) Aim 1.1 (F99): This project determines how Tmtc2 controls cell response to stress and senescence
through Ca2+ homeostasis. Tmtc2 will be knocked down followed by the identification of cell response to
metabolic stress. Mechanistically, Ca2+ channels and pumps interacting with Tmtc2 will be defined.
 2) Aim 1.2 (F99): This project defines how insulin regulates chromatin topology through transcription
factor (TF)-mediated alterations in CTCF binding, subsequently regulating the expression of novel aging-
associated genes. Chromatin topology will be defined upon insulin treatment followed by the identification of
how TFs mediates this process.
 3) Aim 2 (K00): This project further identifies how altered DNA methylation remodels the genomic
template in aging cells to alter CTCF binding and chromatin loops, shifting the transcriptional impact of insulin
and permitting aging-associated metabolic dysfunction. Differential DNA methylation landscape in hepatocytes
from young and old mice will be defined, and its functional implications in the alterations of CTCF occupancy
and chromatin topology in aging will be identified.
 This proposal has the potential to provide new genes or DNA elements as targets to achieve liver
rejuvenation and the reversal of insulin resistance, which is associated with aging. This project also has the
potential to shed light on the fundamental mechanism by which aging shifts cell response to insulin."
10973514,"Alzheimer disease (AD) exacts enormous personal and financial burdens in the aging. People with Down syndrome (DS) (i.e., trisomy 21, HSA21) are at markedly increased risk of AD, a disorder called DS-AD. The clinical and pathological hallmarks of AD are replicated in AD-DS. More than 80% of those living beyond age 65 are diagnosed with DS-AD. The emergence of DS-AD is thus essentially inevitable in the DS elderly and serves as the leading cause of death. DS-AD thus constitutes the largest population in which a genetic lesion causes AD. An important insight into DS-AD is that increased dose of the gene for APP, present on HSA21, is necessary. Findings in mouse models of DS-AD concur, demonstrating a necessary role for increased APP dose and expression for DS-AD neurodegenerative phenotypes. Studies of DS-AD mouse models have provided important insights, but no current model captures all the pathological features of DS-AD. Three important missing features are: amyloid plaques, congophilic angiopathy, and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). We propose to develop and validate a DS-AD model to capture these phenotypes. We will genetically modify the TcMAC21 mouse. This mouse carries an essentially full copy of HSA21 in addition to two copies of homologous mouse chromosomes. To replicate DS-AD amyloid pathology we will humanize the Aβ sequence in mouse APP by crossing with mice in which the Aβ peptide sequence in mouse APP has been humanized, thus conferring a human pattern for processing with increases in APP-C99 and its Aβ products. To introduce human-like tau pathology, including NFTs, the resulting mouse (TcMAC21:APP/hu/hu/hu) will be crossed with mice deleted for mouse tau that express a transgene encoding wild type human Tau. In addition to amyloid and tau pathology we predict the genetically modified TcMAC21 mice will replicate key DS-AD phenotypes. Our hypothesis is that the TcMAC21 mouse will model key pathological features and age-related changes in molecular, cellular and circuit function characteristic of DS-AD. In the R61 Phase: Specific Aim 1 (Project Years 1-3), we will demonstrate feasibility and scale of use, and internally validate it by documenting measures of molecular, cellular, and synaptic age-related phenotypes characteristic of DS-AD with rigor, precision, reliability, and sensitivity, and dependence on APP gene dose. Go/NoGo criteria must be satisfied for moving to the R33 Phase: Specific Aim 2 (Project Years 4,5) in which we will externally validate, through demonstrations of : face validity: 1) measures of cognition; 2) clinical biomarkers, including Aβ42, Aβ40, p-tau species and NFL; construct validity: 1) presence and structure of amyloid plaques and congophilic angiopathy; 2) aggregates of phosphorylated tau; 3) neuroinflammation, including changes in microglia and astrocytes; 4) deficits in synapse number and function; 5) neuron loss; and 6) transcriptomic/genomic signatures; and predictive validity: 1) demonstrate that reducing APP gene copy number prevents/reverses DS-AD linked signatures; and 2) show that clinically feasible interventions prevent and/or reverse DS-AD phenotypes. A valid model will accelerate the ability to understand and treat DS-AD."
10974843,"Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) play major roles in atherosclerosis, a leading cause of cardiovascular disease
(CVD). SMCs can be beneficial or detrimental in atherosclerosis, depending on their transdifferentiation
trajectories into atheroprotective (e.g., fibroblast-like cell) or atherogenic (e.g., macrophage) cell types. My recent
work, combining an SMC-lineage tracing murine model and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), revealed
a novel SMC-derived cell type, “SEM” cell (termed because of co-expression of stem cell, endothelial cell, and
monocyte markers). SMC-derived SEM-like cells have also been identified by other groups. SEM cells highly
express genes related to proatherogenic functions (e.g., inflammation) and may be the precursors for other SMC-
derived cell types (e.g., fibrochondrocyte, macrophage), through which SEM cells may modulate vulnerability
and stability of atherosclerotic lesions. My proof of principle studies in mouse models showed that activation of
retinoic acid (RA) signaling inhibited SMC to SEM cell transition, reduced atherosclerotic burden, and promoted
fibrous cap stability in atherosclerosis. These findings suggest the following central hypotheses: 1) activation of
RA signaling attenuates SMC to SEM cell transition by directly suppressing expression of key SEM cell marker
genes; 2) activation of RA signaling represses proatherogenic functions (e.g., inflammation) of SEM cells during
disease progression; 3) activation of RA signaling is beneficial in established atherosclerosis and accelerates
disease regression by promoting SEM cell atheroprotective functions and differentiation trajectories while
suppressing atheroprone features of SEM cells. These hypotheses will be addressed through the following aims:
Aim 1 (K99 phase) will determine if RA signaling inhibits the SMC to SEM cell transition via RAR/RXR/EZH2-
mediated repression of SEM cell marker genes; Aim 2 (K99 phase) will determine if RA signaling attenuates
SEM cell inflammation during atherosclerosis progression through LXR-mediated repression of inflammatory
genes; Aim 3 (R00 phase) will apply SMC-lineage tracing and atherosclerosis regression mouse models to
determine if RA signaling drives differentiation trajectories of SEM cells towards atheroprotective rather than
atherogenic cell types in advanced atherosclerosis (Aim 3A) and promotes SEM cell apoptosis and subsequent
resorption via macrophage efferocytosis during disease regression (Aim 3B). The proposed studies will be
accomplished in the setting of a comprehensive career development program designed to provide the candidate
with scientific and leadership skills that facilitate the successful transition to an independent investigator in the
field of atherosclerotic CVD. At the K99 phase, the candidate will continue to obtain expertise in molecular,
cellular, and biochemical techniques as well as SMC-lineage tracing and mechanistic and functional investigation
of RA signaling and SEM cells in atherosclerosis mouse models for progressing, advanced, and regressing
lesions. The expert advisory team will guide the candidate in research training, manuscript and grant proposal
preparation, and ultimately in the transition to an independence career over the course of the award period."
10974871,"Stroke remains a major cause of death and disability in the U.S. Identifying modifiable risk factors to develop
effective prevention is the best strategy for reducing the burden of this disease. Racial and geographic
variations in stroke mortality has been observed in the U.S. for decades. However, the reasons for these
variations are still unclear. The impact of radon exposure in relation to human health has been increasingly
recognized. Radon is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas, formed through the radioactive decay of radium-
226, which enters homes, and other buildings, through cracks and penetrations in the building substructure.
Radon has been classified as a human lung carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer
since 1988. Recently, some studies conducted in countries outside the U.S. have linked radon, even at low
levels of exposure, to the risk of stroke. In the U.S., county-level radon exposure has been associated with
elevated mortality from cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The overarching goal of this project is to
examine the association between radon exposure and stroke risk and to investigate whether geographic
variation of radon concentration is related to the distribution of stroke rate in the U.S. Specifically, we will
examine radon exposure at both county- and household-level in relation to the risk of ischemic stroke. In
addition, we will explore the underlying mechanisms by linking radon exposure to blood pressure,
hypertension, lipid profile, and hemostatic and inflammatory biomarkers. Radon exposure is rising steadily
within the modern North American residential environment. The proposed study will be the first to assess radon
exposure and stroke risk in the U.S. general population, including both male and female African Americans and
Caucasians. Since randomized clinical trial on radon exposure is not feasible, findings from this project will
provide insights into the racial and geographic variations of stroke rate in the U.S. and possibly identify a
potential modifiable risk factor for stroke."
10973322,"Abstract
Alzheimer’s’ disease (AD) affects an estimated 6.7 million people aged 65 and older in the US and the number
could grow to 13.8 million by 2060. Despite major efforts to address the impacts of AD, two recently FDA
approved therapies show limited clinical efficacy. Hence there is a need to identify additional therapeutic targets
and facilitate discovery of biomarkers for early detection of the disease. To date, most research has focused on
development of biomarkers for early detection to identify individuals at risk and for enrollment in clinical trials.
Most of these biomarkers are either too expensive, not practical for routine sampling in clinical settings or not
predictive of preclinical AD. Our overarching goal is to identify new biomarkers that reflect early loss of cognitive
status and progression to AD through a simple blood test, and to provide potential insights into disease etiology
using molecular approaches that we have successfully applied in the cardiovascular disease research field.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-protein coding RNAs that are stable in plasma and serve as potential
biomarkers of AD. Moreover, miRNAs are potential therapeutic targets by virtue of their role in gene silencing at
the post-transcriptional level, to prevent production of specific proteins. The proposed studies will address gaps
in AD research by using untargeted and unbiased approaches to identify miRNA biomarkers to discriminate
individuals with early and late-stage AD status, including individuals with mild cognitive impairment with or without
amyloid deposit, a rare group of patients that receive little or no attention in research but are critical for inclusion
in clinical trials. In parallel, we will use a multiomics approach, in contrast to most previous studies that have
used targeted and single omic approaches, to analyze miRNA, mRNA, and protein data derived from temporal
and frontal cortex brain regions from same individuals, respectively, to provide insights into potential regulatory
mechanisms that participant in onset and AD progression. Our central hypothesis is that AD-related miRNAs
are diagnostic biomarkers for early onset and later stages of AD development and that dysregulated miRNAs
and their targets participate in AD pathophysiology, and hence could be utilized for disease attenuation. We will
leverage plasma and brain samples archived at the Wake Forest Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center
(WFADRC) and the University of Washington Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (UWADRC) to test our
hypothesis with the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Identify circulating miRNA biomarkers associated with
individuals at distinct stages of AD progression. Aim 2: Identify potential miRNA regulatory targets underlying
early cognitive impairment and progression to AD. Overall, our study impacts are two-fold: 1) identify potential
blood-based miRNA biomarkers of early cognitive dysfunction, providing avenues for early disease detection
through a simple and relatively inexpensive blood drop test and 2) provide critical insights into novel therapeutic
targets for treatment of early-stage AD."

Autoimmunity”
While heredity is a primary predisposing factor for autoimmunity, cumulative exposures to
environmental factors such as toxic stressors and diet greatly impact latency and severity
autoimmune diseases such as lupus. Our goal is to understand how lupus triggering by an
ubiquitous environmental toxicant can be prevented by dietary modulation of cellular lipids. This
goal is predicated on preliminary studies revealing that 1)airway exposure to crystalline silica, a
recognized autoimmune disease risk factor, triggers early onset of systemic autoimmunity and
glomerulonephritis in the lupus-prone female NZBWF1 mouse and 2)supplementing their diets
with the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a well-known dietary supplement
extracted from cold-water fish, dose-dependently blocks this triggering. Here, we will employ in
vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo approaches to test the hypothesis that DHA consumption prevents silica-
triggered autoimmunity by suppressing inflammatory mediator production, death, and self-antigen
release in alveolar macrophages of NZBWF1 mice. Revealing DHA mechanisms against silica-

subsequent flaring via lung as well as how manipulating cellular lipids through diet can be
exploited to prevent environmental triggering of human autoimmune disease."

detecting changes in somatic genomic sequence, copy number, or methylation status. Many biological and
clinical events, such as hematopoiesis, fibrosis, and tumorigenesis, are executed via global changes in
transcriptional regulation. My PhD advisor Dr. Daniel Kim and I have established a platform for exRNA liquid
biopsy in human blood-plasma that has demonstrated significant diagnostic and monitoring potential in both
Pancreatic cancer and COVID-19 patients. I propose to continue this research to complete my PhD by
assessing diagnostic performance of the exRNA platform in a new cohort of 60 lung adenocarcinoma
(LUAD) patients with matched controls. Furthermore, I will apply my expertise in exRNA liquid biopsies to
assay the transcriptional dynamics of hematopoiesis and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow
(BM) niche. Currently, bone marrow biopsies or aspirations are used to determine bone marrow health and
production. These techniques are costly and require sedation and/or pain relief for the subject and have the
potential to lead to long term discomfort, infection, excessive bleeding, and other side-effects. BM aspirations
remain a critical diagnostic and monitoring tool for HSC transplant recovery, leukemias and lymphomas, blood
cell pathologies, and infections of unknown origin but the primary readout remains identification and counting of
cell types. I hypothesize that hematopoietic lineages within the BM secrete exRNA that reflect cell state and
identity that can be used in a non-invasive RNA liquid biopsy for detailed study of transcription and populations
within the BM. I propose to identify exRNA expressed and secreted by HSCs and the remaining
hematopoietic lineage in order to develop a platform to deconvolute peripheral blood into constituent

Candidate Goals and Mission Relevance: The applicant’s broad, long-term objective is to investigate how high-
(circuit/behavioral) and low- (subcellular/molecular) level organizational principles of the brain cooperate to drive
learning. The proposed research activities will build a foundation for this long-term goal and, in so doing, will
promote BRAIN 2025 Report goals by integrating new technological and conceptual approaches to causally link
intracellular Ca2+ release (ICR) from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to neural activity dynamics and behavior.
Project description: Dendritic Ca2+ is central to neural plasticity mechanisms allowing animals to adapt to the
environment. ICR has long been thought to shape these mechanisms. The applicant recently carried out the first
investigation of ICR in mammalian neurons in vivo to uncover how this subcellular phenomenon shapes
experience-dependent feature selectivity across the dendritic arbor of pyramidal neurons (PNs) in mouse
hippocampal area CA1. This work raises important questions regarding when, where, and how ICR is engaged
to support learning. The applicant will address these questions in the following Aims:
Aim 1. Characterize plasticity-associated ER Ca2+ dynamics in dendrites in vivo (K99): To achieve this
Aim, the applicant will perform simultaneous dual-color, dual-plane in vivo 2-photon imaging of cytosolic and ER-
resident Ca2+ in dendrites of single CA1 PNs during head-fixed spatial navigation of novel virtual environments.
Aim 2. Define the synaptic logic tying intracellular Ca2+ release to in vivo synaptic plasticity (K99/R00):
The applicant will first create a novel molecular tool to optogenetically induce ICR (Aim 2.1; K99). The applicant
will then combine this precise interventional tool with single-cell imaging, inducible blockade of presynaptic
release, and optogenetic dampening of ICR to dissect the synaptic logic by which ICR participates in plasticity
induction in behaving mice. (Aim 2.2; R00).
Aim 3. Dissect excitatory circuit-molecular mechanisms driving intracellular Ca2+ release in vivo (R00):
The candidate will optogenetically activate specific excitatory projections onto distinct dendritic compartments of
single CA1PNs while monitoring ER Ca2+ dynamics in behaving mice. Local pharmacological manipulations will
dissect contributions of the two canonical pathways that convert presynaptic excitatory input to postsynaptic ICR.
Career development plan: The applicant will extend a highly complementary Co-Mentorship arrangement
between Drs. Franck Polleux and Attila Losonczy who possess deep expertise in cellular/molecular/genetic and
in vivo/behavioral approaches, respectively. The applicant will receive robust consultative support from Dr.
Stefano Fusi of Columbia’s Center for Theoretical Neuroscience and Dr. Darcy Peterka, Director of Cellular

 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 200 genetic loci for breast cancer. To
translate these findings into an improved understanding of cancer biology, and thus, disease prevention and
treatment, it is essential to identify the target genes of these loci. However, causal genes (and the underlying
biological mechanisms) remain unknown for most of the GWAS-identified breast cancer risk loci despite recent
publications of transcriptome-wide association studies that have discovered a few putative causal genes.
Proteins, the final gene products, are key working molecules for cellular functions. Thus, proteins have a more
direct impact on disease risk than mRNAs. In addition, protein levels and mRNA levels are only moderately
correlated, with the median correlation being only 0.46, and for many genes, the correlation is close to zero.
Therefore, compared with investigating RNAs, directly investigating proteins may be more likely to reveal
causal genes and underlying biological mechanisms. We propose a novel proteogenomics study to identify
putative target proteins for breast cancer by capitalizing on multiple existing unique resources, 1) normal fresh-
frozen breast tissue samples from over 5,000 cancer-free women in the Susan G. Komen Tissue Bank (KTB);
2) proteomics and genomics data in 125 breast cancer tissue samples in the Clinical Proteomic Tumor
Analysis Consortium (CPTAC); and 3) GWAS data of ~ 427,000 breast cancer cases and controls from three
large consortia. We will conduct a well-powered proteome-wide association study (PWAS) by integrating
genomics and proteomics data in breast tissues in three racial groups (Aim 1). We will prospectively validate
the promising breast cancer risk proteins in pre-diagnostic normal breast tissues in a nested case-control study
including 120 incidence breast cancer cases and 480 individually matched controls (Aim 2). We will evaluate
the biological functions of the top breast cancer risk proteins by conducting a series of bioinformatics analyses
and in vitro functional assays (Aim 3). The proposed study will be conducted by an interdisciplinary
collaborative team of experts in breast cancer, epidemiology, genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics, and
biostatistics, with almost 20 years of collaboration. This proposed project is extremely cost-efficient because
breast tissue samples and the genomics data for Aim 1 will be available at no cost to this proposed study. The
proposed study is highly innovative as it is the first prospective breast tissue-based proteomics study and also
the first proteogenomics study by integrating genomics and proteomics data. Our study will be highly significant
and impactful by 1) unveiling the target proteins for future mechanistic research; 2) improving our
understanding of the genetic and biological basis for breast cancer; and 3) having important implications for
disease prevention and treatment for this common malignancy."

Primary glomerular diseases, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
(FSGS), immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), and membranous nephropathy (MN), are associated with
significant morbidity and mortality in both adults and children. The Cure Glomerulonephropathy (CureGN)
study launched in 2013 to address critical knowledge gaps in the disease pathogenesis, natural history, and
response to therapy of these heterogeneous disorders. It is a study of unprecedented size and remarkable
depth, built by a unique, collaborative, interdisciplinary community. The international consortium includes
researchers with diverse expertise, affected patients and advocacy groups, the biopharmaceutical industry,
and federal funding agencies. CureGN has successfully recruited a diverse cohort of nearly 2800 adult and
pediatric participants with MCD, FSGS, IgAN, and MN from more than 60 clinical study sites into a prospective,
longitudinal, observational cohort study. Biospecimens, clinical data, and patient-reported outcomes are
collected to enable high-quality clinical, mechanistic, and translational investigations. This foundational work is
being conducted by a well-functioning collaborative group including the Data Coordinating Center (at the
University of Michigan, Northwestern University, and Cleveland Clinic) and four Participating Clinical Centers
(managed at the University of Pennsylvania, Columbia University, University of North Carolina, and the
Pediatric Nephrology Research Consortium). CureGN will pave the way for personalized care in glomerular
disease by disentangling the heterogeneity of disorders that are etiologically diverse but currently grouped into
only four diagnoses.
In CureGN’s third study phase, we propose to maintain and enhance the CureGN Consortium infrastructure
and ancillary study program to accelerate patient-relevant glomerular disease research. We will continue our
core observational study, enrolling additional participants in a recruit-to-replace strategy to maintain an active
cohort of 2000 participants with high-quality clinical data and biomaterials. We will implement state-of-the-art
data collection tools including remote data and biospecimen collection, new biospecimen types, and use of
mobile devices for patient-facing engagement and medical record linkages. Mature scientific working groups,
committees and ancillary infrastructure will continue to support a multidisciplinary core and ancillary study
program to achieve the scientific goals of CureGN. We will continue outreach to the scientific community by
expanding CureGN’s role as an outstanding training vehicle for the next generation of glomerular disease
researchers and attracting cutting-edge, established scientists to glomerular disease through opportunity pool
grants, collaborations with patient advocacy groups and professional societies, training workshops, and
support of ancillary studies from academic and industry partners. Through this coordinated effort, CureGN is
prepared to accelerate the improvement care of glomerular disease patients."
10949173,"Project Summary
The last five years have been the hottest on record with urban areas suffering the brunt of
increased temperatures through the urban heat island (UHI) effect. During periods of
heatwaves, the UHI effect further increases local temperatures through and iterative process of
increased energy use and storage, with urban areas commonly being 5-10C warmer than rural
areas. The impact of heatwaves on human health are seen with increased morbidity and
mortality during periods of heatwaves. Furthermore, there is increasing recognition of the
detrimental impact of warming global temperatures on kidney functioning. The goal of this work
is to 1) expand on previous work that established the relationship between heat waves and
hospitalization due to kidney dysfunction by investigating potential environmental moderators
(e.g., impervious land use, decreased green space, and being historically redlined) of this
association; 2) utilize the knowledge to action theory of intervention development to translate
these research findings into preliminary community action; and 3) obtain advanced skills and
expertise in applied environmental health for reducing environmental health disparities due to a
changing climate. This work will set the foundation for a larger, in-depth study aimed at testing
and evaluating interventions to decrease the impacts of heatwaves on human health.
Establishing community partnerships during the knowledge to action aim study will be
paramount for future intervention refinement and evaluation. Future studies will continue to
utilize the knowledge to action framework and principles of community based participatory
research to develop innovative methodologies for decreasing environmental health disparities
and creating health equity."
10953913,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
CD8+ T cells are critical determinants of the anti-tumor immune response. The TCF1+ progenitor-exhausted
subset of CD8+ T cells is critical to their therapeutic efficacy, providing a more durable response than their TCF1-
more effector-like counterparts. However, the mechanisms underlying the generation and maintenance of this
TCF1+ differentiation state remain unclear. T cell metabolism has been intimately linked to differentiation, and
recent work from our group and others has begun to interrogate the potential of manipulation of metabolic
pathways to alter differentiation. This R03 proposal aims more comprehensively to identify metabolic enzymes
controlling the generation of TCF1+ progenitor cells for further functional and mechanistic studies, and
characterize key transcriptomic and metabolic characteristics of TCF1+ cells induced under different conditions.
The first aim, Identifying metabolic enzymes whose loss results in an altered T cell differentiation state,
will interrogate the effect of loss of specific metabolic enzymes on TCF1+ progenitor cell generation across
multiple TCR affinities. A CRISPR/Cas9 screen in vitro will target enzymes from pathways upregulated upon T
cell activation. Candidate genes regulating TCF1 expression and T cell differentiation will be identified by
sequencing and functionally validated by flow cytometric and metabolic analyses. Finally, effects of target
manipulation on anti-tumor efficacy will be evaluated in vivo in mice and in an immunocompetent human patient-
derived organoid system.
The second aim, Identifying transcriptional and metabolic characteristics of TCF1+ progenitor-like cells
induced by different metabolic alterations, will determine core properties of these cells. Using drugs and
cytokine cocktails known to induce this TCF1+ population through differing mechanisms, activated T cells will be
manipulated in vitro to identify transcriptomic and metabolomic similarities and differences. Pharmacological
agents targeting hits identified in Aim 1 will also be tested.
Data from these aims will allow me to identify both therapeutically targetable nodes for TCF1+ progenitor state
induction, and key transcriptional and metabolic characteristics of TCF1+ progenitor cells, including their core
characteristics and intrinsic heterogeneity. These data will be leveraged to identify high-quality candidates for
future mechanistic studies, and provide a basis for a future R01 submission and career transition from a KL2-
supported scholar to an independent investigator."

The major goal of Phase 2 of COBRE funding of the Mississippi Center of Excellence in Perinatal Research 
(MS CEPR) is to further the sustainability of an innovative, nationally recognized center of excellence in 
perinatal research spanning the spectrum from adverse pregnancy to subsequent health outcomes in mothers 
and offspring. More specifically, perinatal research encompasses the study of disease states that occur during 
gestation and early post-natal development that result in long-term adverse consequences in the mother and 
offspring across their lifespans. Research focuses on the integrative relationships and health disparities in
adverse pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and developmental programming of cardiovascular, renal, 
metabolic and behavioral diseases. This is an important area for research especially in light of the increasing 
evidence of long term health consequences brought about by adverse fetal environment, and subsequent low 
birth weight. An adverse perinatal environment is thought to account at least in part for the development of 
obesity, cardiovascular, renal, and behavioral diseases later in life for male and female offspring, and 
predispose the mothers for increased risk of these diseases with aging. This is especially important for 
Mississippi since we have one of the highest rates of preeclampsia, low birth weight, preterm labor, obesity, 
cardiovascular, renal and metabolic diseases and hypertension in the United States. The addition of COVID19 and the complications associated with it further add to disproportionate levels of morbidity and mortality in
both our Caucasian and African American populations. Thus, Phase 2 of this COBRE will continue to improve 
sustainability and research excellence in the MS CEPR by providing infrastructure and capacity for continued 
building of a multidisciplinary, diverse group of basic, clinical and population scientists working on the common
synergistic theme of perinatal diseases and health disparities and to facilitate their collaborations. Specific 
Aims of the Administrative, Mentoring and Education Core A are to provide leadership for all aspects of the MS 
CEPR; coordinate and provide support for all Center-related activities; maintain and improve mentoring and 
education programs for MS CEPR research project leaders (RPLs) or pilot project leaders (PPLs); interface 
with the NIGMS, the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) administration, the UMMC Office of 
Research and Sponsored Programs including Pre- and Post-Award Centers, the departments represented by
RPLs and PPLs; recruit, train, and mentor a diverse group of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to 
provide the next generation of perinatal researchers and to provide mentoring experience for RPLs and PPLs 
as needed; organize networking meetings and seminars as well as meetings of the Executive Committee, 
Internal and External Advisory Committees; and increase the number of investigators at UMMC who focus on 
perinatal research by working with department chairs to hire new perinatal investigators."

10861022,"Project Summary/Abstract – Project 4 Radiation Pneumonitis/Fibrosis
There is a critical, unmet need to develop medical countermeasures (MCM) for the mitigation of the 
delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE), namely radiation pneumonitis/fibrosis, in victims 
successfully treated for acute radiation sickness following a radiological or nuclear incident. The overall objective 
of project 4 is to complete activities necessary to bring BIO 300 (“BIO 300”) nanosuspension (Humanetics 
Corporation, Edina, MN) towards approval under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Animal Rule 
regulatory pathway for the indication to increase survival in individuals acutely exposed to pulmonary-toxic doses 
of radiation [e.g. delayed effects of acute radiation-exposure (DEARE)-lung]. Our published data indicates BIO 
300 (400 mg/kg, QD, oral gavage) confers a significant improvement in survival from DEARE-lung when 
treatment is started 24 hours after exposure to life-threatening doses of radiation and continued for six weeks
(5). Further, clinical data demonstrate an excellent safety profile when BIO 300 is administered as a daily oral 
regimen (500 - 1500 mg) over a minimum duration of six weeks. 
Project 4 is highly interactive with the other Projects and Cores within the INTERACT Consortium. Studies 
in Aim 1 are designed to optimize the BIO 300 dosing regimen to maximize the likelihood of survival from DEARE-lung. Higher drug exposure has been observed in murine and non-human primate models when BIO 300 is 
administered by intramuscular (IM) injection versus oral administration. Therefore, IM administration may further 
improve the therapeutic benefit of BIO 300 on 220-day survival and mitigation of lung damage beyond that 
observed with oral dosing. Specific Aim 2 will be conducted in collaboration with Core B-Multispecies Efficacy 
and Pharmacometric Modeling. Experiments in this aim are designed to identify and validate plasma-based 
pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers associated with BIO 300 mediated ERb activation and downstream effects 
on cellular senescence in rodents and NHP. A systems biology approach incorporating pharmacometric 
modeling will be utilized, and will incorporate known BIO 300-mediated effects on PD biomarkers in cancer 
patients undergoing clinical radiation therapy to relate the proposed mechanism of action of BIO 300 in animal 
models to the presumed mechanism in humans. The role of cellular senescence in DEARE-lung is further 
explored in Aim 3 through the testing of senolytic agents alone or in combination with BIO 300. Further, Aim 3
will address knowledge gaps relevant to the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying ARS evolving towards 
DEARE and testing of novel senolytic agents (BCL-xL-P) through strong collaborations with Projects 1, 2, and 
3. Power calculations and statistical analysis for Project 4 will be performed by the biostatistician in Core A -
Administrative Core. The proposed Aims are only achievable through a cooperative research agreement, as 
proposed by the INTERACT Consortium, whose members bring together expertise in every major area required 
to probe the complex biological processes orchestrating radiation damage in lung tissue and discover new 
biomarkers for tissue injury and recovery."

10954409,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In Jackson, MS, decades of under-investment in public water system infrastructure have resulted in severe
disruptions to water access and diminished water quality. Jackson has been under a consent decree since 2012
for failing to meet operational and maintenance standards and continues to have boil water notices issued
regularly, eliciting concern about the health effects of chronic water contaminant exposures. Despite emerging
recognition of the importance of environmental exposures in cardiometabolic-cardiovascular disease (CM-CVD)
risk, few epidemiologic studies have investigated the CM-CVD effects of public water contaminants, even though
these data can prioritize policy-based solutions to limit their impact. In this context, the flagship NHLBI/NIMHD-
funded Jackson Heart Study (JHS), a prospective cohort study of 5,306 African-American adults, offers a rare
opportunity to evaluate the effects of chronic water contaminant exposures on CM-CVD. In preparation for this
application, we extracted all 165,580 compliance monitoring records (2000-2023) collected by the Mississippi
Department of Health for 74 water systems serving Madison, Hinds, and Rankin counties comprising JHS
(encompassing 38 unique ZIP codes), demonstrating (1) substantial temporal variability (seasonal/yearly) in
prioritized water contaminants (e.g., total trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids, lead) across these water systems;
(2) select water contaminants linked to CM-CVD (e.g., lead, disinfection byproducts) are higher in water systems
serving JHS communities compared to those nationwide. Strikingly, disinfection byproducts and lead are largely
unrelated to source water and are directly related to the deterioration and management of water system
infrastructure, relevant to the ongoing Jackson water crisis. Our central hypothesis is that water toxicants
(captured by water system monitoring records and quantification of ≈1000 circulating chemicals in the blood
[“molecular exposome”] pioneered by our group) will be associated with CM-CVD phenotypes over ≈2 decades
in JHS. In Aim 1, we quantify 26 public water contaminant exposures (including disinfection byproducts,
inorganic metals, radionuclides, organic compounds) for all JHS participants over ≈2 decades and measure their
association with key CM-CVD risk factors (e.g., blood pressure, insulin resistance, obesity). Aim 2 provides a
complementary biochemical approach, quantifying relation of the molecular exposome–and its changes over
time–with these environmental exposures over ≈2 decades and measuring their relation to CM-CVD phenotypes.
In Aim 3, we examine association of both water monitoring records and biochemical exposures (molecular
exposome) with 20-year incident CVD risk, including how these relations may be mediated by the effect of water
contaminant exposures on traditional CM-CVD risk factors. If successful, this application will define the
importance of water toxicant exposures to CM-CVD over 2 decades in a highly vulnerable, minoritized community
with a contaminated water supply, with direct implications for policy. Resources generated here will be accessible
to the scientific community for future discovery and comparison to other populations."
10972838,"Project Summary/Abstract
Inflammation is a central pathologic mechanism across a variety of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular,
metabolic, and pulmonary disorders. Current approaches to disease management center on non-specific
strategies to attenuate local and systemic inflammation to improve health outcomes. However, emerging data
supports the presence of endogenous mechanisms increasing an individual’s capacity to resolve inflammation,
highlighting a yet untapped novel therapeutic target. New insights into the resolution of inflammation reveal this
process can be mediated by lipid-derived specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), which trigger a cascade
of events that attenuate the inflammatory response. SPMs have been implicated in the resolution of
inflammation in a variety of diseases such as cardiovascular disease, COVID-19, and asthma; however, their
role in resolving inflammation and counteracting lung injury in COPD patients is unknown. The objective of this
proposal is to determine if greater plasma circulating SPM concentrations (reflecting individual capacity to
resolve inflammation) are associated with improved respiratory outcomes in individuals with emphysema. To
accomplish this, we will leverage data from the robustly-phenotyped and diverse Subpopulations and
Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS) cohort with available biospecimens in
BIOLINCC. We will then validate our findings in The Losartan Effects on Emphysema Progression (LEEP)
cohort. This proposal will accomplish the following specific aims: in SA 1: we will characterize circulating SPM
concentrations as a biomarker for decreased potential to resolve chronic inflammation across two diverse
populations of emphysema patients and identify risk factors (e.g.race/ethnicity, economic deprivation, etc.) for
low SPM status. We hypothesize that there will be clear disparities in SPM across subpopulations reflecting
differences in resilience to inflammatory insults. In SA 2: we will determine the association between circulating
SPM concentrations and COPD health outcomes (i.e., lung function, respiratory symptoms) across two
populations of emphysema patients. We hypothesize that greater SPM status will be associated with greater
lung function and decreased respiratory morbidity. This work is directly related to the mission of NHLBI as it will
provide foundational evidence for SPMs as an emerging therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of
COPD, stimulating basic discoveries about the causes of, and resilience factors for, lung disease and enabling
the translation of these findings into clinical practice."

 Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves a long prodromal stage where β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques accumulate
before clinical symptom onset. Yet, the molecular factors that underlie the striking heterogeneity in the onset,
accumulation, and response to AD neuropathology are poorly understood. Advances in imaging genetics offer
an opportunity to move the field towards precision interventions by deconvolving the clinical heterogeneity by
using sensitive imaging biomarkers and genetics to nominate novel targets for intervention.
 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 70+ genetic loci linked to AD, shedding light
on disease mechanisms. However, traditional case/control designs are limited by clinical misdiagnosis. My
prior work has leveraged imaging-derived traits as a more precise phenotype closer to disease biology in
genetic studies. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), computational imaging analysis, and
harmonization allow us to extract quantitative features from images that humans cannot see at a scale that can
facilitate well-powered GWAS with more precise traits.
 We will leverage one such advanced modeling algorithm to estimate the age of Aβ+ onset from
16,000+ harmonized Aβ positron emission tomography (PET) from the AD Sequencing Project-Phenotype
Harmonization Consortium (Contact-PI: Dr. Timothy Hohman--primary mentor). Characterizing the genetic
architecture of Aβ+ onset can provide insight into the AD cascade of our research participants decades before
they joined our studies. Our initial work has shown that the age of Aβ+ onset varies significantly (40 to over 90
years) but is a heritable trait. Beyond APOE, in a subset of the cohort we propose here, we have found that
genes involved in Aβ clearance pathways seem to influence age of Aβ+ onset. Additionally, biological sex
appears to play a significant role.
 In this proposal, I will expand upon this preliminary work to characterize the association of established
AD-risk loci with age of Aβ+ onset, identify novel genetic drivers of age of Aβ+ onset leveraging state-of-the-art
genome-wide approaches, and identify sex-specific genetic drivers of age of Aβ+. We will use cutting-edge
methods that allow for inclusion of admixed individuals (rather than traditional exclusionary approaches) and
that account for sex as a biological variable. I will receive training from world experts in AI and advanced
analyses of large-scale image datasets, cutting-edge genomic analyses, the neurobiology of aging and clinical
geriatrics, and important career development skills for a successful physician-scientist career.
 This K76 research proposal – along with the parallel detailed training plan that expands upon my
expertise in genetics and radiology– uniquely position me as a leader and expert at the intersection of imaging
and genetics to lead the way in developing more precise treatment strategies in AD and related dementias."
10974954,"Summary Abstract: Protein Networks as Synergistic Drivers of Membrane Remodeling
Membrane curvature is required for many cellular processes, from assembly of highly curved trafficking vesicles
to extension of needle-like filopodia. Consequently, defects in membrane curvature play a role in most human
diseases, including altered recycling of receptors in cancer and diabetes, targeting of filopodia by pathogens,
and hijacking of vesicle traffic during virus replication. Therefore, understanding the basic molecular mechanisms
that drive membrane remodeling is essential to our knowledge of cellular physiology and human disease.
 Research on membrane curvature has primarily focused on individual protein domains with specialized
structures, such as crescent-shaped scaffolds and wedge-like amphipathic insertions. While this work has
provided invaluable insights, this “structure-centric” perspective ignores two essential facts. First, most
membrane remodeling proteins contain large intrinsically disordered domains in addition to structured domains.
And second these disordered domains drive assembly of large, multi-valent protein networks.
During the past 5 years, our group has made pioneering discoveries in support of the hypothesis
that disordered protein networks are essential drivers of membrane remodeling in the cell. Specifically,
using clathrin-mediated endocytosis as a model pathway, we showed that intrinsically disordered domains
generate steric pressure at membrane surfaces. This pressure provides a surprisingly potent driving force for
membrane bending, especially when coupled synergistically to the contributions of structured domains. This
work was the first to reveal the membrane remodeling abilities of disordered proteins, examples of which have
since been discovered in diverse areas of biology. Additionally, we have recently found that disordered domains
within endocytic proteins drive assembly of liquid-like protein networks which efficiently initiate endocytosis.
Importantly, this liquid-like behavior has the potential to resolve a long-standing paradox by explaining how
curved membrane structures can be simultaneously highly interconnected, yet dynamic and flexible.
 These findings suggest urgent questions about the role of disordered protein networks in the key steps
of membrane remodeling: (i) initiation, (ii) curvature induction, and (iii) cargo selection. First, how do protein
networks initiate remodeling events, controlling their spatial and temporal dynamics? Second, once an event is
initiated, how do protein networks bend membranes, stabilizing either a convex or a concave shape? Third, as
the membrane bends, how does the protein network select cargo, such as transmembrane proteins, which are
essential to the structure’s biological function? Building on our recent discoveries, this work will shift the paradigm
for understanding membrane curvature beyond its present focus on in vitro structure-function relationships
toward an understanding of disordered protein networks. By demonstrating novel synergistic mechanisms, this
research will provide a blueprint for the study of protein networks at membrane surfaces throughout the cell."

Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and death in the United States. Acid accumulation in
the brain during ischemic stroke causes neurotoxicity and irreversible tissue damage. Understanding the
factors that contribute to acid-induced cell death during ischemic stroke is thus critical to define the
pathological process and develop effective treatment strategies. The proton-activated chloride (PAC) channel
(also known as ASOR or PAORAC) is a recently discovered cellular pH-sensor that plays a critical role in
determining the outcome of brain damage after ischemic stroke. Under acidic conditions, the activation of PAC
allows an influx of chloride current into the neuron which further causes cell swelling and death. In 2019, the
PAC gene was cloned by two independent groups and was found to be a novel chloride channel. In 2020, I
revealed the first near-atomic cryo-EM structures of the human PAC channel at two different conformational
states, including an apo state and a proton-bound non-conducting state. Our study provided a wealth of
information about channel stoichiometry, domain architecture, and anion selectivity mechanisms of PAC. While
promising progress has been made towards understanding the function of this channel, a complete picture of
how PAC responds to environmental acidification is still obscure due to the limited knowledge about the pH-
sensor and the lack of an open state structure. Likewise, although the PAC current is sensitive to several non-
specific chloride channel blockers, their inhibition mechanisms are unexplored. The long-term objective of this
research is to unveil the molecular principles underlying PAC channel function in both physiological and
pathological conditions, and to develop specific compounds that could be used to mitigate the effect of
ischemic stroke in patients. In this K99/R00 proposal, will carry out a comprehensive structural and functional
investigation of PAC by revealing its pH-sensing residues and the associated structural mechanisms (Aim 1). I
will also explore strategies to obtain an open state structure of PAC and provide detailed mechanistic
knowledge about its voltage-dependent gating mechanisms (Aim 2). I will also study the PAC channel in its
native state by purifying endogenous PAC protein from mouse brain (Aim 3). Lastly, I will investigate small
molecule-mediated inhibition mechanisms through combined structural and functional approaches (Aim 4).
The mentored phase of the award will be conducted at Van Andel Institute under the supervision of Dr. Juan
Du. During this time, I will receive additional training in membrane protein structure determination, patch-clamp
electrophysiology experiments, and endogenous protein purification techniques. These components are not
only essential for the completion of the research but will also prepare me to become an independent
investigator in the near future."

Our lives unfold over time, weaving rich, dynamic, and multisensory information into a continuous experience.
However, we remember this as a series of discrete events. For example, the memory of a two-hour movie
consists of a few memorable moments tied to the main story. During encoding, we segment deviant events and
associate relevant events. During retrieval, we utilize the temporal association among encoded events to search
for specific memory information. The hippocampus (HPC), prefrontal cortex (PFC) and substantia nigra (SN) are
thought to support cognitive computations (i.e., conceptual prediction, prediction error detection, temporal
association) that are critical for the encoding and retrieval of episodic memory. However, how these three regions
work together to facilitate the construction of episodic memory in humans remains unclear. The proposed study
aims to address this by identifying neural dynamics in the HPC-PFC-SN network and revealing circuit-level neural
mechanisms of event segmentation and its relationship with human episodic memory.
The central hypothesis is that event segmentation, which is influential in episodic memory formation and retrieval,
emerges from the difference between the HPC perceptual predictions and received sensory inputs, which is
tracked by dopaminergic neurons in the SN to update event models stored in the PFC. To test this, I will record
both single neuron activity and local field potential signals in the HPC-PFC-SN network while patients, who have
depth electrodes implanted for clinical purposes, encode, and retrieve the memory of semi-realistic experience
created by well-controlled video clips. I will also build a computational model that can rigorously reproduce the
observed behavioral and neural signatures. The trained model will be used as a proxy of the HPC-PFC-SN
network to study the causal link between this tripartite network and memory behaviors by simulating
computational “lesions”, which will provide insightful guidance for real electrical stimulation.
To achieve the proposed goals, I will pursue training mentored by a group of experts in different fields, including
the intraoperative recordings (Dr. Ziv Williams and Dr. Adam Mamelak), analyses of inter-regional neural
dynamics and electrical stimulation (Dr. Ueli Rutishauser), and computational modeling (Dr. Gabriel Kreiman).
The comprehensive analytic approaches spinning from behavior measurements, invasive neural recordings from
both microscopic and mesoscopic levels, computational modeling and electrical stimulation will provide valuable
opportunities to strengthen our understanding of human episodic memory system. The expected outcomes of
this proposal will potentially advance the development of therapeutic interventions for memory-related disorders."

In mammals, 5-methylcytosine is the most common form of DNA methylation, and the level of methylation of
some specific CpG sites shows a strong correlation with age. These correlations can be used to build machine
learning-based models that can accurately predict the age of biological samples. Because these models can
quantify age with very high accuracy, researchers have termed them epigenetic aging clocks (e.g., Horvath’s
pan-tissue epigenetic clock and Hannum’s blood-based epigenetic clock). However, the reliability of existing
epigenetic clocks is limited, as they are built based on pure correlations, and it is unclear whether age-
associated methylation changes are causal to aging-related phenotypes. A new generation of epigenetic
clocks built on causal information will be more reliable and can enable the possibility of large-scale screening
of anti-aging interventions.
For the F99 phase of this proposal, I performed epigenome-wide Mendelian Randomization to identify CpGs
potentially causal to aging-related traits. This causal information was then incorporated into epigenetic clock
models to build causality-informed aging clocks, which are shown to separate age-related damage from
adaptation, namely DamAge and AdaptAge. I also built ClockBase, a database that contains over 300,000
experimental samples from GEO with the epigenetic age pre-calculated. I plan to further standardize the
sample information using large language models and apply the causality-informed biomarkers to screen for
anti-aging interventions.
In the K00 phase, I will use the protein language model and protein design tool to expand the universe of anti-
aging interventions. Specifically, I will study the protein structural features across mammalian species with
various lifespans to understand which features are associated with longevity. Then, I can incorporate this
information into protein design and optimize existing proteins to support a longer lifespan.
This proposal will advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying aging by incorporating
causality into epigenetic clock models. By distinguishing between age-related damage and adaptation, we can
develop more precise and informative aging biomarkers, which will have significant implications for aging
research and potential clinical applications. The K00 phase of the project will pioneer the application of protein
language models and protein design tools in aging research. Ultimately, it could pave the way for a completely
new branch of aging research – treating aging through the gradual redesign of the proteome."

Social Determinants of Health (SDoH), or the environment and conditions in which one lives, can greatly
impact one’s health and quality of life. In the White House conference on Hunger, Nutrition and Health, the
president stressed the importance of good nutrition and healthy eating on child academic and health
outcomes.1 The Council outlined a national strategy that included the need to improve food access and
affordability, integrate nutrition programs and education in healthcare, provide support for these activities
through Medicaid and Medicare, and increase nutrition and food security research.2 Thus, there is an urgent
need to develop and test effective and acceptable workflows that connect families experiencing food insecurity
with healthy nutrition support programs. In this proposal, we will conduct a pilot type 2 hybrid effectiveness-
implementation trial of the I-FRESH (Implementing Food Referrals for Equity and Sustained Health)
program using a Roll-Out Implementation Optimization (ROIO) design among families with children with
nutrition-related illnesses who receive Medicaid or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
benefits. I-FRESH, our food security nutrition support program that was developed with several community
stakeholders, involves 4 main components: screening and identification of families experiencing food insecurity
(FI); social worker/care navigator-led discussions with families to determine need and readiness to receive
support; referrals and assistance to engage with these programs; and follow-up assessments to determine fit,
track utilization, and determine need for additional referrals. This program will be tested at Rady Children’s
Hospital San Diego in the Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes, Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver
Disease, and general gastroenterology clinics as these conditions are heavily affected by nutritional intake.
These settings are conducive to testing the initial implementation and effectiveness of the program because
they already have dietitian and social work support and built the FI screener in the electronic health record. To
aid in this work, we have obtained funding from USDA/NIFA to provide nutrition incentives or a fruit and
vegetable prescription (FVRx) program to families receiving SNAP benefits. We will apply the PRISM4, 5
implementation determinant framework and RE-AIM6, 7 implementation outcome framework to guide
implementation processes and evaluation, and engage stakeholders. The specific aims of this proposal are:
1) To engage our Community, Clinical, Administrative, and Research Advisory Board (CARAB) to refine and
optimize the program before and after each roll-out in 4 clinics; 2) To assess implementation outcomes; and 3)
To examine preliminary impact and effectiveness outcomes on family-level food insecurity and pediatric
nutrition-related health outcomes. This information will be important as health system leaders, insurance
providers, community programs, public health agencies, and policy makers strive to integrate these programs
into our healthcare system."
10972936,"ABSTRACT
Spinal cord injury (SCI) interrupts blood flow, and the O2 partial pressure (PO2) in the injured spinal cord drops
to near zero. This contributes to necrosis and secondary injury. Our central hypothesis is that increasing O2
delivery to the injured cervical spinal cord will attenuate inflammation and neuronal cell loss, thereby preserving
breathing function. The vast majority of prior O2 therapy studies after SCI use hyperbaric O2 (HBO), and there is
considerable support that HBO reduces inflammation and secondary neurodegeneration. However, HBO
consists of 100% O2 (hyperoxia), which is easy to implement, but at elevated pressure (hyperbaria), which is
challenging to implement. Preliminary data indicate that the more challenging hyperbaria may not be needed.
Specifically, normobaric hyperoxia (i.e., 100% O2 at ambient pressure) rapidly restores spinal PO2 after acute
SCI and triggers anti-inflammatory mechanisms with a specific impact on microglia. Neuroinflammation after SCI
contributes to scarring and neuronal loss, and impairs plasticity in spinal respiratory motor pathways. Thus, Aim
1 will determine if normobaric O2 therapy, initiated acutely (i.e., hours-days) after cervical SCI (cSCI), increases
spinal PO2, mitigates microglial-driven spinal neuroinflammation, and preserves breathing ability. Preliminary
data also indicate that a 1-hour per day treatment with normobaric hyperoxia has only a modest impact on
secondary neuronal loss after SCI (i.e., neuroprotection). However, more robust neuroprotection can be
achieved with HBO therapy. Since the fundamental difference between normo- and hyperbaric therapy is total
blood O2, we predict that supplementing O2 delivery through alternate means will enable normobaric therapy to
achieve greater neuroprotection. To test this idea, we will study perfluorocarbons - molecules that increase
plasma O2 solubility and delivery to the injured spinal cord. Preliminary data show that treatment with a “next
generation” perfluorocarbon known as NanO2 is safe, well tolerated, and preserves spinal tissues post-SCI. In
Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that combining normobaric hyperoxia with NanO2 acutely after cervical SCI
synergistically increases spinal PO2, and promotes neuroprotection in primary (acute) and secondary cSCI. The
proposed work will utilize our established cervical SCI models in the rat, including mid-cervical contusion and C2
hemilesion. Outcome measures include 1) cell-specific molecular responses (e.g., neurons, astrocytes and
microglia) via flow cytometry, 2) spinal immunohistochemistry and histological neuron counts, 3) in vivo magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) for visualizing lesion volume, and ex vivo MRI for evaluating neural tracts in high-
resolution (tractography), 4) respiratory outcomes including diaphragm EMG and breathing in unanesthetized
rats, and direct measure of phrenic nerve output in anesthetized rats, and 5) spinal O2 measurements (intraspinal
optode)."

Preserving and repairing injured neurons is the primary goal of treatments for brain injuries. Yet, delivering
therapeutics specifically to neurons has been a challenge due many factor. Increased glucose uptake and its
hypermetabolism, is a hallmark of injury or evolving injury in neurons in many pathological conditions (e.g.
seizures, stroke, trauma). Delivering drugs specifically to injured neurons in the area of pathology, would
address a significant gap in neuroprotective approaches, opening new treatment avenues for acute CNS
disorders. We seek to address this gap by developing novel dendrimers that take advantage of altered glucose
transport in injured neurons, without a need for a targeting ligand or antibody.
Previously, our group developed hydroxyl polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers that specifically targeted
reactive brain microglia/macrophages and attenuated neuroinflammation and injury in multiple models of brain
injury, and now are in early Phase 2 clinical trials. This application aims to develop and validate a novel
dendrimer made primarily from glucose that preferentially targets injured neurons. We have designed non-
degradable dendrimers made primarily of glucose building blocks, that can facilitate enhanced uptake due to
multivalent surface interactions with glucose transporters. We hypothesize that glucose dendrimers will localize
primarily into injured neurons, enabling sustained delivery of drugs for neuroprotection and preventing neuronal
loss. Importantly, our preliminary data, with a generation-2 glucose dendrimer (GD2) with 24 glucose
molecules on the surface, suggests that they specifically localize in injured/active neurons in vitro and four
clinically-relevant, diverse in vivo models of acute neuronal injury. Glucose dendrimer-ketamine conjugate
(GD2-ket) is more effective than ketamine alone in suppressing clinical seizures in an established rodent
epilepsy model. We will test our hypothesis by performing experiments in the following aims: Aim 1: Determine
the extent and specific mechanisms of glucose-dendrimers (GD) uptake in neurons. Aim 2: Evaluate in vivo
cellular biodistribution and pharmacokinetics (PK) of systemic glucose-dendrimers in a mouse model of acute
neuronal injury induced by epilepsy; Aim 3: Determine efficacy of glucose-dendrimer-ketamine conjugates in
rodent model of epilepsy. The proposed glucose dendrimer platform can impact treatments for multiple CNS
disorders, especially in the acute phase, opening new avenues for nanomaterials. Our team has the
combination of dendrimer nanomedicine, neuroscience, epilepsy, and brain injury expertise to carry out the
proposed studies and enable translation from the bench to bedside."
10949480,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Mitochondrial dysfunction (MD) plays a central role in the pathophysiology of many human diseases
commonly referred as non-communicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs are non-infectious, non-transmissible
disorders characterized by low-grade chronic inflammation, among which the most common are obesity, insulin
resistance, diabetes, forms of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. NCDs affect
an estimated 41 million people each year. Additionally, MD has also been implicated in aging and age-related
diseases, including neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, which represent
the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States, with cost for long-term and hospice care calculated to be
around 200 billion dollars per year. One cause of MD is an increase in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations
resulting in impaired oxidative phosphorylation that leads to loss of bioenergetic homeostasis, increased cell
apoptosis, and senescence. To address the role of mtDNA mutations on tissue/organ homeostasis, two
independent groups developed a knock-in mouse expressing a proofreading-deficient version of the nucleus-
encoded catalytic subunit of mtDNA polymerase-γ (PolgA). The mtDNA mutator mouse model demonstrates a
cause-and-effect relationship between slowly increasing somatic mtDNA mutation levels and several phenotypes
associated with aging that manifest much earlier in life, including reduced lifespan, weight loss, alopecia, anemia,
kyphosis, osteoporosis, sarcopenia, and loss of subcutaneous fat. Although this mouse model has been key to
understand the effect of mtDNA mutations driven MD on organismal health, the global MD results in overall
tissue/organ dysfunction and makes it difficult to dissect how different tissues are affected and compensate for
MD, since it has not possible to separate single organ dysfunction from other organs equally affected by MD.
Moreover, due to the overall marked and severe progeroid phenotypes that affect the auditory, visual, and
ambulatory systems in this model, it has not been possible to test how MD affects brain health and cognition. To
overcome this limitation, we have generated a novel knock-in inducible mtDNA mutator mouse (RJA-
PolgACDS/CDS) with both spatial and temporal regulation capabilities that will allow us to study the effect of mtDNA
mutation-induced MD in single tissues at different time-points. The overall goal of this proposal is to validate this
new mouse model and demonstrate its utility in studying the role of MD in a broad range of human diseases. We
will test its temporal and spatial inducibility by crossing it with a whole-body expressing Cre mouse (Aim 1) as
well as inducible (CreERT2) and muscle-specific (ACTA1-Cre) Cre-expressing mouse lines (Aim 2). The
proposed work is highly responsive in addressing important knowledge gaps in understanding the role of MD on
organ homeostasis, including its role on onset and progression of many human diseases. Successful completion
of this work will provide a novel and unique animal model to investigate the relationship between MD and several
diseases and will provide a novel platform to investigate therapeutic strategies to target these pathologies."

 This is a K23 award application for Dr. Laura Graham Holmes, a clinical psychologist with expertise in autism,
to independently conduct research to develop psychosocial interventions that will improve mental health and
quality of life for autistic adults. The K23 will provide her with the support necessary to acquire critical skills in
three key career development areas: 1) community-engaged intervention development; 2) clinical trial design
and evaluation of implementation; 3) developing ethical data and safety monitoring protocols for populations at
heightened risk for suicide. To achieve her goals, Dr. Graham Holmes has assembled an interdisciplinary
mentoring team comprised of Dr. Susan White (Co-Primary Mentor), a recognized leader in psychosocial
intervention development in autism, Dr. Sarit Golub (Co-Primary Mentor), a leading expert in clinical trials and
implementation research with sexual and gender minority populations, and Dr. Carla Mazefsky (Co-Mentor), a
pioneer in research on emotion dysregulation and suicide in autism. Complementing these experts, Dr. Graham
Holmes also has a 5 member advisory committee to support her proposed development of a psychosocial
intervention for sexual and gender minority autistic adults.
 A substantial proportion of autistic people identify as sexual or gender minorities (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender or gender non-conforming). Current evidence demonstrates that autistic sexual and gender minority
people are at increased risk for co-occurring mental health conditions including depression, anxiety, and suicide
attempts compared to autistic cisgender heterosexual adults and report more unmet mental health care needs.
Dr. Graham Holmes’ objective is to address the lack of available evidence-based psychosocial interventions for
this population. Her research will result in preliminary data to support a clinical trial to test a novel community-
based minority stress intervention for sexual and gender minority autistic people. The intervention will adapt
evidence-based principles for addressing minority stress among sexual and gender minorities using a co-
designed, co-facilitated, online group psychoeducation intervention approach. She proposes the following
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Gather formative qualitative data from autistic sexual and gender minority people and
professionals with relevant experience to inform the development of the Autistic LGBTQIA+ AffIrming
InterVEntion (ALIVE); Aim 2: Pilot test and refine the intervention content, delivery, and efficacy and
implementation measures via a randomized controlled trial in preparation for a Hybrid Type 1 (efficacy +
implementation) clinical trial.
 The proposed research is significant because it will result in an accessible, scalable intervention for a
vulnerable, underserved population. The proposed research is innovative because it uses an evidence-based
approach designed to address minority stress that will be adapted via a community-engaged process for a
population with multiple intersecting minority identities."
10954562,"Urinary tract obstruction causes kidney injury, which, if left uncorrected, may lead to an irreversible renal loss
especially in infants. The pathophysiology of neonatal obstructive nephropathy has been a focus of considerable
research interests for decades, but significant gaps in understanding include vascular mechanisms that underlie
impairment of renal microcirculation. In the present application, we propose a novel concept that alterations of
newborn renal vascular resistance (RVR) and perfusion by acute ureteral obstruction are mediated by reactive
oxygen species-driven biosynthesis of peptidase endothelin-converting enzyme 1, which proteolytically processes
multiple renal big endothelins (ET1-3) to their vasoactive isoforms. ET-derived renal diacylglycerol (DAG) activates
renal vascular smooth muscle cell TRPC3 channels, leading to receptor-operated extracellular calcium entry,
prolonged vasoconstriction, RVR elevation, and hypoperfusion. To investigate these concepts, we will utilize
newborn pigs that are maintained under intensive care as a preclinical model for reversible urinary tract obstruction
in infants. These pigs and a novel TRPC3 knockout neonatal rat strain will be used to delineate calcium-dependent
signal transduction mechanisms in renal vascular smooth muscle cells that mediate 1) persistent hypoperfusion,
2) kidney injury, and 3) impaired myogenic renal autoregulation during and after acute urinary tract obstruction.
The proposed studies in this application will accrue mechanistic data that will not only improve our understanding
of neonatal renal vasculopathy but may lead to potential diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets for obstructive
renal insufficiency in newborns."
10954498,"Project Summary and Abstract
 Stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and
depression, are serious mental illnesses that occur twice as frequently in women compared to men.
Despite this disparity, we do not understand the biological basis of these sex differences. A key
feature of stress-related disorders such as PTSD is hyperarousal, which contributes to cognitive
flexibility deficits. The neuropeptides orexins, known to promote arousal and the stress response, are
altered in PTSD patients; increased orexin expression has been reported in women compared to men
in postmortem clinical populations. My previous research demonstrates that female rats exhibit higher
levels of orexins compared with male rats, contributing to impaired habituation to repeated stress and
subsequent cognitive flexibility deficits. However, the brain areas and specific receptors that orexins
target to cause sex-specific cognitive deficits after stress are unclear. Importantly, the orbitofrontal
cortex (OFC) is known to play a role in cognitive flexibility, and both the orexin 1 and 2 receptors
(Ox1R and Ox2R) are present in this brain area. Another important question that remains unanswered
is the mechanism by which orexins are upregulated in females compared with males. The gonadal
hormone estrogen is a likely candidate, as our previous data indicate that estrogen and orexin levels
are positively correlated and females in proestrus (when estrogen levels peak) show higher orexin
system activity and cognitive deficits after stress. Thus, the proposed research aims to understand
how orexins contribute to sex-specific cognitive deficits after stress and the mechanism behind sex
differences in the orexin system. Specifically, Aim 1 of this proposal will use a newly developed orexin
sensor paired with fiber photometry to examine real time orexin binding in the OFC to understand how
orexins lead to sex-specific cognitive deficits after stress. Aim 2 will examine the mechanism behind
sex differences in the orexin system by manipulating estrogen levels and assaying orexin measures
and cognitively flexibility after stress. We will also test whether estrogen exerts its actions via the G
protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), which is highly expressed in orexin neurons. These
findings will have immediate implications for treatment, as orexin antagonists are currently used to
treat insomnia, so it is crucial we understand how this neuropeptide system differs between males and
females, as there may be a future need to develop sex-specific guidelines in dosing. Moreover,
orexins regulate stress responses, food intake, autonomic responses, and emotional memory and
thereby contribute to a variety of psychiatric symptoms. In this way, targeting orexins may treat a
broad range of psychiatric symptoms in a sex-specific manner."

Transcription plays an oversized role in determining proper inflammatory response in immune cells such as
macrophages (MF). Transcriptional master regulators of MFs are thought to be the main drivers of chromatin
reprogramming during myeloid cell differentiation, polarization and activation. However, recent studies have
expanded this “developmental TF-centric” model and suggest that signal-dependent TFs, in particular
repressors, likely to have a pioneer role in the shaping the MF epigenome. Such an expanded model also
predicts that active transcriptional repression and chromatin bookmarking by signal-dependent master
regulators is a key mechanism for the safeguarding the enhancer repertoire and proper deployment and
resolution of an inflammatory response. Recently, we identified such a signal-dependent TF, the heme-
regulated repressor BACH1 (BTB Domain and CNC Homolog 1), with properties of a master regulator of the MF
epigenome. Our preliminary data is contrary to current dogma about this TF and also challenging the
current view of inflammatory gene regulation. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that BACH1 acts
as a pioneering repressor, signal-dependent master regulator and an epigenomic safeguard that plays
a key role during macrophage differentiation and polarization/specification by actively repressing
enhancers, genome-wide, controlling inflammatory, metabolic and differentiation-specific genes with effects on
the baseline, amplitude and proper kinetics of the inflammatory gene expression. We propose three interrelated
and integrated but independent Specific Aims in which we will combine new genetic mouse models with cutting
edge molecular biology approaches to establish BACH1 as a critical modulator of MF inflammatory gene
expression and subtype specification. Our approaches aim to provide deep mechanistic insights on BACH1
function on active repression, pioneering, transcriptional activation, 3D chromatin structure and inflammatory
gene expression and establish BACH1 as a novel signal-dependent master regulator and as part of the core
hardwired transcriptional circuit of MFs. Moreover, results from the proposed work are expected to push the field
forward by providing a mechanistic framework of how heme, a molecule vital for life and cell metabolism but
cytotoxic when in excess, can affect the differentiation and inflammatory potential of MFs."

SUMMARY
The goal of the Research Resources Core B of the Mississippi Center of Excellence in Perinatal Research (MS 
CEPR) COBRE in Phase 2 is to continue to provide investigators and trainees with access to state-of-the-art 
equipment and technical expertise needed to perform their research. During Phase 1, new Sub-cores were 
developed: Animal and Telemetry, Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) and Flow Cytometry, 
Mitochondrial Research, Confocal Microscopy, Pediatric Echocardiography, Genomics, and Statistical 
Analyses. New state-of-the-art equipment was purchased for these Sub-cores by UMMC and the MS CEPR 
COBRE. Two of these Sub-cores are now independent revenue neutral recharge centers, the Pediatric Echo 
and Genomics Sub-cores. For Phase 2, a new sub-core was added, the Clinical Research Sub-core, that 
provides support for research project leaders (RPLs) and pilot project leaders (PPLs) in performing clinical 
studies. Faculty and staff of Core B interact closely with RPLs and PPLs and their trainees, and are dedicated 
to providing coordinated and collaborative resources to support their research. In addition, Core B personnel 
provide expert assistance in the use of existing methods but are also available for development of new 
methods and assays, improvement of existing assays, provide interpretation of results and data, provide 
training, technical support, and supervision for equipment and analytical tools. The MS CEPR Sub-cores are 
unique and their expertise is not available in the other COBREs on campus (the Cardiorenal and Metabolic 
Diseases Research COBRE (P20 GM104357) (CMDR, now in Phase 2) or the Center for Psychiatric 
Neurosciences COBRE (P30 GM103328, now completed Phase 3)) or the University of Southern Mississippi 
INBRE program, but are available to their investigators. The Specific Aims of the Research Resources Core B 
in Phase 2 include the following: 1) To continue to support and adapt state-of-the-art research services to meet 
the needs of RPLs and PPLs and facilitate recruitment of new investigators and center members; 2) To 
continue to provide access to, maintenance, training and supervision in use of state-of-the-art equipment for all 
investigators, staff and students, internal and external; 3) To optimize all assays and core services, to provide 
improvement in existing assays and services, and to assist in the interpretation of results and data; 4) To 
develop a recharge center business model for all Sub-cores in Core B that is compliant with federal funding 
guidelines to provide sustainability of Core B services, equipment, and facilities. The services of Core B are 
absolutely necessary for the successful completion of the studies described in Projects 1-3 and will be an asset 
to PPLs as well. In addition, other investigators, both intramural and extramural, have access to the Research 
Resources Core B services."
10861019,"The growing threat of terrorist events involving radiation, as well as the potential for radiation accidents, 
underscores the need for effective medical countermeasures (MCM) against radiation. The blood-forming system 
is the most sensitive tissue to radiation, resulting in the hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) after 
high dose radiation exposure and death from infection and/or bleeding if untreated. Survivors of H-ARS suffer 
later in life by the delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE), a number of chronic illnesses affecting 
multiple organ systems. To date, Neupogen (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, G-CSF), Neulasta 
(pegylated-G-CSF), and Leukine® (GM-CSF) are the only MCM approved by the FDA for treatment of H-ARS, 
and will be given as first-line treatments for individuals exposed to high dose radiation. This proposal brings 
together uniquely qualified investigators with a long-term productive collaboration studying the efficacy of 16,16 
dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (dmPGE2) in H-ARS and DEARE and hematopoietic regeneration. Dr. Orschell is a 
radiobiologist and experimental hematologist who developed and validated models of H-ARS in mice of all ages 
and strains. Dr. Pelus is a leader in hematopoietic stem cell biology and eicosanoid biology. Together, the Co-PIs have shown that a single dose of dmPGE2 given up to 30hr after lethal radiation exposure, significantly 
enhanced 30 day survival and hematopoietic recovery. With collaborator Dr. Miller, the team has shown that 
dmPGE2 given as a radioprotectant before irradiation provides significant alleviation of hematopoietic, lymphoid, 
cardiac and renal DEARE. However, dmPGE2, nor any of the three licensed MCM listed above, have shown 
efficacy for DEARE when given as radiomitigators (after irradiation). Collaborator Dr. Zhou, an expert in DEARE 
and senescence, has recently joined the group to test the ability of novel Bcl-xl-targeting senolytic agents to 
alleviate DEARE in mice treated with dmPGE2 as a radiomitigator. The PIs will test the hypothesis that dmPGE2
fulfills all the requirements of an ideal MCM for H-ARS and when used in conjunction with senolytics in survivors, 
embodies an effective strategy to mitigate both the acute and delayed toxicities of lethal radiation exposure. The 
following Specific Aims will be tested: 1a) determine the optimal dosing regimen and delayed administration 
schedule of dmPGE2 in well-established young adult, pediatric, and Jackson Diversity Outbred mouse models
of H-ARS, and b) perform PK of dmPGE2 in primates, 2) establish the transcriptional mechanisms affected when 
dmPGE2 is administered as a radiomitigator 24hr after exposure and identify the target hematopoietic cell 
population(s), and 3) explore combinatorial activity of dmPGE2 with: a) RP-1, a novel non-lipid LPA2 receptor 
agonist (with Dr. Tigyi), b) Neupogen®, and c) a novel senolytic MCM (with Dr. Zhou) to determine if co-administration provides superior efficacy in H-ARS and/or DEARE in mouse models compared to either MCM 
singly. Our data thus far combined with those from successful completion of this proposal will move dmPGE2
further towards development for approval as a MCM for use in a mass causality event for the benefit of mankind."
10861021,"A nuclear blast or other mass casualty radiation event will necessarily cause multiorgan radiation 
toxicities compounded by physical trauma and thermal burns. Deaths will result from complex and combined 
organ injuries that occur in a time- and dose-dependent manner. While the strategic national stockpile includes 
agents for hematological acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS), no candidates are approved for gastrointestinal 
ARS (GI-ARS) and few if any candidates are approved for other organs. As cutaneous radiation injury [CRI 
(blistering, bleeding)] when combined with H/GI-ARS can lead to death, an agent that aids multiple epithelial 
tissues for combined injuries would be an ideal medical countermeasure. In light of the far-reaching potential of 
FGFs, we developed an FGF-2 peptide mimetic, FGF-PT; this alternative to the full-length protein is 
economical, easily scaled and synthesized, and has a long storage life. We hypothesize that the pluripotent 
effects of FGF-PT on epithelial, mesenchymal, and endothelial cells, which include preservation and 
proliferation of progenitor cells, maintenance of normal cellular maturation and function, and improved 
tissue perfusion, will mitigate combined radiation injury syndromes. We propose to test this hypothesis 
through the following Specific Aims: 
 Aim 1: We will move FGF-PT toward an investigational new drug (IND) application for GI-ARS. We 
have already discussed the pre-IND process with representatives of NIAID, FDA, and BARDA. Based on this 
meeting, we propose a 6-step process to confirm mitigation benefit and mechanism of action in a GI-ARS/HARS model in Wistar Rats. Studies will include pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and toxicity 
testing in rats followed by PK and PD in Rhesus macaques to determine the drug dose and schedule for full 
good laboratory practice (GLP) testing in rats and macaques in separate follow-up studies. 
 Aim 2: We have shown that FGFs can mitigate radiation dermatitis and improve platelet function 
following irradiation. In this aim, we will elucidate the role of both systemic and topical FGF-PT for CRI using an 
NIH Swiss model (strontium-90 beta burn) and Göttingen minipig model. In the minipig, we will test our models 
for allometric scaling between mouse, rat, monkey, and pig, and employ a radiation burn healing model (16 
sites of 4x4 cm /minipig) developed by Core B. 
 At the completion of Year 3, we expect to have sufficient knowledge of dose, schedule, mechanism of 
action, human relevance, and safety to design a “pivotal” study for both the rat and monkey, according to the 
Animal Rule, for GI-ARS under GLP conditions. Funding for that study will be sought in Year 4. Near the 
completion of Year 4, we expect to have similar evidence for CRI. While minipigs are expected to play a key 
role, the CRI NIAID meeting this month (May 2019) has not yet recommended a model design. In Year 5, we 
will refine our approach to meet criteria more clearly defined at that time for FDA approval of agents for CRI."
10861020,"The US population at large, and particularly military personnel and first responders, are at risk of radiation expo-sure due to the explosion of a nuclear device, a nuclear reactor accident, and the threat of radiation terrorism. 
There is no radiation medical countermeasure (RCM) drug approved by the FDA that meets the criterion of a 
gastrointestinal (GI) radiomitigator – an agent which mitigates the acute GI radiation syndrome (GI-ARS) when 
administered after the exposure. Ionizing radiation kills cells that are unable to repair their DNA, primarily via 
mitotic catastrophe and apoptotic cell death. Post-irradiation genotoxic stress and cell injury is an unsolved 
medical problem. A critical barrier to progress in development of RCM drugs is that a traditional human 
clinical trial is not an option. Therefore, FDA approval of a RCM is done under the Animal Rule that requires 
detailed understanding of its mechanism of action, demonstration of its safety, and efficacy in animal models, 
and its safety in humans. In this transitional research proposal, we propose studies to fully satisfy the mech-anism of action requirement of the Animal rule for Radioprotectin-1 (RP-1) a new radiation mitigator we devel-oped with previous NIAID funding and develop a single-dose extended release formulation that meets CONPOS 
requirements of a RCM. Our overall goal is to prepare RP-1 for regulatory approval as a first-in-class synthetic 
GI radiation mitigator. RP-1 is the first specific agonist of the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor subtype 2 
(LPA2) with picomolar EC50, which reduces radiation injury-induced mortality in mice. Our central hypothesis
is that RP-1–activated, uniquely long-lasting (> 16h) signaling mediated by the LPA2 G protein-coupled receptor 
(GPCR), is responsible for mitigation of genotoxic stress and promotion of cell survival. Our hypothesis predicts 
that RP-1 achieves this via 1) obligate stimulation of the LPA2 GPCR, 2) sequential recruitment of supramolecular 
signaling interactomes responsible for the long duration of its action, 3) augmentation of DNA repair and 4) 
enhanced survival of LGR5 intestinal stem cells (ISC). Our objectives are: 1) determine in detail the unique 
molecular mechanism of how RP-1 acts via LPA2 to recruit the interactomes required for overcoming genotoxic 
stress, and 2) identify the specific subpopulation of ISC that is protected by RP-1 in vivo using transgenic mice 
that express fluorescent protein in the LGR5 marker bearing ISC and 3) develop a single dose extended release 
nanoparticle formulation that mitigates the GI-ARS. Although this information is necessary to move RP-1 forward 
toward regulatory approval, the body of knowledge we will generate also represents significant and previously 
unknown information concerning radioprotective signaling mechanisms.Our expected outcomes will include 1) 
establishing that LPA2-dependent recruitment of the IEX-1–TRIP6–ERK1/2-AKT interactome is required for mit-igation of genotoxic stress; 2) defining the role of RP-1 effects that enhance DNA-dependent Protein Kinase-dependent DNA repair and prosurvival signals; 3) demonstrating that RP-1 is an effective mitigator of GI-ARS 
by protecting ISC in mice; 4) a single-dose extended-release RP-1 formulation. The impact of our project will 
directly affect our first-response options in treating patients with radiation injury. The aims of the project are:
Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that RP-1 via LPA2 mediates long-lasting activation of DNA repair and pro-survival signaling in LGR-5 positive intestinal stem cells.
Aim 2. Develop a nanoparticle-based extended-release RP-1 formulation for the treatment of the GI-ARS 
of mice and Rhesus macaques.
All data obtained will be used for a RP-1 Drug Master file and presented to the FDA during our PRE-IND meeting 
in the final year of the project and shared with the research community at large."

We propose to meet the need of the NIAID Centers for Medical Countermeasures Against Radiation 
Consortium (CMCRC) for 1) administrative infrastructure to organize interactions and facilitate collaboration 
among CMCRC investigators, 2) oversight of programs using funds to stimulate Pilot Studies, 3) timely sharing 
of CMCRC-generated data, biomarkers, (animal) models and reagents among CMCRC investigators and with 
the research community, and, 4) biostatistics and bioinformatics support, in response to AI-10-012, with staff 
who bring years of experience working along similar lines in the NHLBI Progenitor Cell Biology Consortium 
(PCBC) Administrative Coordinating Center (ACC) and the Progenitor Cell Translational Consortium (PCTC) 
Administrative Coordinating Center (ACC). The proposed investigators and staff have extensive experience in 
coordinating centers, organization of meetings, collaborative research under cooperative agreements, 
consortium infrastructure, web site, communications, monitoring and documentation. 
We will adapt and advance our infrastructure (hardware, software, web sites and links, offices, office 
equipment and staff) in place for the PCBC ACC and PCTC ACC to extend to the CMCRC resulting in an 
immediate, running start for the CMCRC Consortium-wide Coordinating Center (CCC) on day one. We will 
proceed to expand the functions of the extant infrastructure to additional, innovative use of social media to 
reach all corners of the CMCRC community and out to the broader research community. The CMCRC 
Consortium-wide Coordinating Center will follow procedures it has established and is using for other NIH-supported coordinating centers to perform administrative tasks necessary to conduct consortium meetings and 
conference calls, prepare agendas and minutes, administer funds for training and education and support a web 
site for communications, transmission of data, information and descriptions of methods (e.g., protocols) and 
requests for reagents, biomaterials and (animal) models to be shared. 
Our proposal is both highly efficient and innovative because of the expertise and experience of our 
investigators, the uninterruptable nature of their backup for each other and the uninterruptable nature of the 
systems we will extend and update from the PCBC and PCTC to the CMCRC. The channeling of resources to 
translational research, basic research necessary to support translational research and the extension of our 
infrastructure through social media will be substantial."
10927254,"A lack of diversity in STEM continues to be a persistent problem, limiting our capacity to address 
pressing problems facing individuals, institutions, communities, and our society as a whole. 
Although many initiatives exist on our campuses to promote diversity and include 
underrepresented populations at the student level, diversity in the STEM professoriate remains 
low. For lasting change to occur and to truly include URM faculty in our institutions of higher 
learning, we need to identify approaches that can be implemented by universities to transform 
hiring, faculty engagement, and tenure and promotion processes. Modeled on the Meyerhoff 
Scholars Program, the UM FIRST initiative will work toward effecting institutional, departmental, 
and faculty-level changes to foster inclusive excellence at both the University of Maryland School 
of Medicine (UMSOM) and the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC). 
The goals of the Evaluation Core team are to work collaboratively across UMSOM and UMBC, 
as well as with the NIH FIRST Coordination and Evaluation Center (CEC) to assess, monitor, and 
track program activities. Using a mixed methods approach, the Evaluation Core will assess the 
impact of the UM FIRST Initiative in addition to providing ongoing feedback throughout the project 
to inform modifications in the UM FIRST activities. 
The evaluation will examine several primary and intermediate outcomes of UM FIRST. The 
primary outcomes of interest include: examining the change in percent of new faculty hires 
representing URM groups at the institution and department level; examining the change in 
percent of URM faculty retained at the institution and department level, and; examining the 
impact of the UM FIRST initiative on academic productivity of UM FIRST cluster hires. The 
intermediate outcomes of interest include: an increase in URM representation among new 
faculty applicant pools at the institution and department level; the successful hiring of UM FIRST 
faculty cluster hires across UMBC and UMSOM; documented change in written institution hiring 
policies; documented change in written APT policies; a significant increase in institution DEI 
culture and climate; an increase in institutional commitment to DEI among leadership, STEM 
faculty and their departments, and among UM FIRST faculty cluster hires and their mentors, 
and; the successful implementation of UM FIRST Faculty Development Core activities."
10807085,"ABSTRACT – PROJECT 2
A central hypothesis of this Program is that humoral and cellular adaptive immune responses synergize to control 
HCV infection. The objective of Project 2 is to develop an HCV vaccine component that elicits pan-genotypic 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cell memory. When combined with a vaccine component designed to elicit broadly neutralizing 
antibodies (Project 1), we expect to generate immunity equaling or exceeding protective adaptive responses 
acquired naturally by spontaneous resolution of acute HCV infection. 
Several observations indicate that vaccine-induced T cell immunity will be essential for protection. Initial control 
of acute HCV replication is temporally associated with onset of a functional T cell response. Infections resolve 
only if this response is sustained. Durable T cell memory develops and may prevent persistence upon re-infection. Antibody-mediated depletion of CD8+ or CD4+ T cells from immune chimpanzees before re-infection 
caused prolonged or persistent infection. Finally, protection against heterologous HCV genotypes has been 
observed in immune chimpanzees, but can fail suggesting that HCV genetic diversity limits protective T cell 
memory.
Two major challenges for vaccine development are (i) the tremendous genetic diversity of HCV genotypes and 
(ii) the lack of an animal challenge model to assess vaccine efficacy. To provide broad T cell immunity, a 
tetravalent vaccine comprised of conserved HCV non-structural proteins from HCV gt1a, 1b, gt2, and gt3 
sequences will be assessed. NS antigens will be designed computationally from a large number of available 
HCV sequences, resulting in Mosaics that disfavor inclusion of uncommon amino acids that would otherwise 
elicit less productive vaccine- or virus strain-specific T cell responses. Mosaics are indistinguishable from natural 
HCV proteins in sequence and processing for HLA presentation to T cells. Mosaic transgenes will be delivered 
by two viral vectors, Ad48 (a rare human subtype) and MVA, that can be translated for human vaccination. 
A key unanswered question is whether vaccines generate tissue-resident memory T cells, and whether they are 
equivalent to those elicited by spontaneous resolution of infection. We will undertake the first characterization of 
liver-resident CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations from chimpanzees that spontaneously resolved HCV infection. 
This analysis will use cryopreserved liver mononuclear cells collected with NIH support before the moratorium 
on chimpanzee use in biomedical research. Key measures of quality (breadth, frequency and function) will be 
established, and compared with tissue-resident T cells primed in rhesus macaques with the tetravalent Mosaic 
vaccine. In co-operation with Project 3, T cells will also be compared by Cite-Seq to provide integrated cellular 
protein and transcriptome measurements. These comparisons are expected to provide a surrogate measure of 
efficacy for vaccine-primed T cells in the absence of a virus challenge model."

Psychiatric illnesses affect millions of Americans and can be associated with substantial emotional and
financial hardship for both those who are affected and their families. In fact, these illnesses are responsible for
a substantial portion of the disability associated with chronic medical conditions overall, in large part because
they 1) tend to be persistent or recurring throughout the lifespan, and 2) often lead to impairments in day-to-
day functioning. However, despite these well-known consequences of psychiatric conditions, there are still very
few validated, evidence-based, transdiagnostic interventions that are explicitly focused on the prevention of the
onset of these conditions and the associated disability. Thus, in this application, we propose to conduct a
randomized clinical trial of a four-session, group-based behavioral intervention called Resilience Training (RT)
that was previously shown in a randomized, waitlist-controlled trial to significantly reduce levels of subthreshold
symptoms of psychosis (often called “psychotic experiences” or PEs) and other transdiagnostic symptoms of
psychiatric illnesses in young adults (college students) with these symptoms. It has been well-established that
the presence of subclinical psychopathology including PEs is associated with an increased risk for the
subsequent development of a range of psychiatric illnesses, including psychotic, mood, anxiety and substance
use disorders, as well as suicidal behaviors and functional impairment. Therefore, in the proposed trial, we will
test whether RT leads to reductions in PEs and the distress associated with them, and reductions in anxiety,
depression and suicidality, in young adults with PEs, over a two year period. This trial will also investigate
whether RT leads to a reduction in emotion reactivity, a reflection of stress sensitivity, and improves the
functional connectivity and function of the hippocampus, a brain region involved in the body’s responses to
stress. Moreover, this project will evaluate whether RT positively impacts objective outcomes in college
students that reflect academic functioning and psychological health, including course credits earned, retention
in college and use of psychiatric crisis services, in addition to clinical outcomes, such as symptom levels and
the onset of psychiatric disorders. Lastly, the project will test whether the predicted mediating mechanisms of
RT (the reduction in emotion reactivity and improvements in hippocampal connectivity and function) are
responsible for any of its positive effects on functional and clinical outcomes. Overall, if the preventive efficacy
of RT is demonstrated, the results of this study will lay the foundation for dissemination of RT within a wide
range of communities where young people spend their time, on college campuses as well as in vocational and
employee training programs, primary care clinics, and work settings."

Candidate and Career Development Plan: This REDI Mentored Entrepreneurial Career Development Award
(K01) will support Otis (Shaun) Owens, Ph.D. to establish an independent program of translational research for
supporting aging-in-place for African-Americans living with ADRD and their care partners. Dr. Owens is an
Associate Professor at the University of South Carolina’s College of Social Work with expertise in developing
technology-based programs to support healthy aging. Dr. Owens will strengthen and address gaps in his
experience through a mentored training program focusing on: (1) advancing his knowledge of remote monitoring
technologies for aging-in-place among community-dwelling individuals living with ADRD (2) developing skills in the
quantitative research methods used to analyze and visualize longitudinal sensor data from remote monitoring
technologies; and (3) building the entrepreneurial acumen for transforming academic innovations into
commercially viable products or services. Mentoring and Environment: Dr. Owens is supported by a team of
senior researchers/mentors, including Dr. Sue Levkoff in ADRD, Drs. Jeffrey Kaye in remote monitoring
technologies/data analytics, and Mr. Larry Frye in entrepreneurship. Training activities will take place at two highly
collaborative research environments i.e., the University of South Carolina, and Oregon Health & Science
University. Research: Rural, low-income African-Americans have the highest ADRD incidence and prevalence
rates but have the least access to formal quality dementia-relate care. To support aging-in-place among
individuals living with ADRD, there is growing evidence that demonstrates remote monitoring technologies can
augment care partners and other support services by facilitating the completion of activities of daily living and
maintaining communication between individuals living with ADRD and their care partners. Despite the success of
remote technologies, no studies have investigated the impact of remote monitoring on the acceptability, feasibility,
and effectiveness of remote monitoring technologies among rural, lower-income African Americans living with
ADRD and their care partners. Understanding the impact of remote monitoring technology on this population can
guide the development of tailored aging-in-place interventions for rural, lower-income African Americans living with
ADRD and their care partners. Specific Aims: Among rural, low-income African Americans living with ADRD, I
seek to (1) identify barriers to aging-in-place, current technology use behaviors, and attitudes toward remote
monitoring technologies among low-income African Americans living with ADRD and their care partners and (2)
examine the usability, acceptability, and feasibility of deploying a remote monitoring system in the homes of rural
low-income African-Americans living with ADRD and their care partners for supporting activities of daily living. The
proposed mentored research and training will provide Dr. Owens with the preliminary data for larger grants (e.g.,
SBIR) to support his long-term goal of establishing an independent research program that produces commercially
viable solutions for promoting aging-in-place among individuals living with ADRD and their care partners."

This project is a collaboration between SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University (Brooklyn, NY), the
University of Ibadan (Ibadan, Nigeria) and the University of the West Indies (St. Augustine, Trinidad and
Tobago), which aims to examine differences in clinical presentation, health outcome, and treatment
response among patients with psychotic disorders around the world, with a novel emphasis on the Global
South. Building on extensive pilot work in the INTREPID I and INTREPID II studies, which laid the
groundwork for the identification of untreated psychosis in these locales, we newly incorporate a matched
cohort of patients receiving inpatient psychiatric care in these settings, and via collaboration with Stanley
Center for Psychiatric Research, all participants will undergo state-of-the-art whole genome sequencing
(WGS). We will benchmark the current generalizability of current polygenic scores to these populations,
and estimate the prevalence of rare, deleterious genomic variations (e.g. copy number variants) of known
neurodevelopmental relevance. The resultant clinical and genomic data will serve as the basis for
comparative analyses of these populations with US-based and international studies of psychosis in diverse
populations, namely VA Cooperative Studies Program #572 and the Million Veteran Program, and the
NIMH-supported Populations Underrepresented in Mental illness Association Studies (PUMAS) and All of
Us (AoU) studies, particularly with respect to illness presentation, treatment response, and comorbid
physical health problems. Collaboration with and equitable participation in large-scale, international
research consortia is a major focus of this project, which will also support two trainees at the University of
Ibadan, and the establishment of expanded, diverse-ancestry study cohort, with detailed data on untreated

10973533,"This is a Beeson K76 Career Development Award for Dr. Sara LaHue, a fellowship-trained inpatient neurologist (neurohospitalist) clinician-investigator. Dr. LaHue requests 5 years of salary and research support to provide protected time and training to study delirium risk factors and associated longitudinal clinical trajectories in older adults with acute mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Delirium is a sudden change in mental status affecting over 7 million hospitalized adults in the United States annually and is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD), functional and cognitive decline, and death. Dr. LaHue’s long-term goal is to become a leading expert in geriatric inpatient neurology, applying an aging biology lens to advance delirium diagnostics and therapeutics to improve health outcomes for older hospitalized adults. This project will advance her career development through investigating post- traumatic delirium as a high-impact, patient-focused outcome with substantive importance to both geriatrics and neurology. While Dr. LaHue is uniquely qualified to pursue her career goals, additional advanced training in four areas is critical for her success: (1) aging biology research methods, (2) geriatric TBI research methods,
(3) advanced biostatistical methods, and (4) leadership. Dr. LaHue developed a rigorous 5-year training program with her exceptional mentoring team to gain this foundation. This application will provide preliminary data and tangible skills to support Dr. LaHue’s future NIH R01 applications and launch her independent research career. As a neurohospitalist caring for patients with delirium, Dr. LaHue recognized that patients with neurological disorders are disproportionately excluded from delirium research, limiting generalizability of existing research to these populations. Delirium affects nearly half of adults with mild-moderate TBI, yet existing knowledge is largely limited to moderate-severe TBI (despite mTBI accounting for >75% of US TBI cases) or young populations. There is a critical need to identify how baseline vulnerabilities, such as advanced biological age, inform delirium risk in geriatric TBI, and how delirium impacts both cognitive and functional outcomes, to optimize recovery for older adults with mTBI. To address these critical knowledge gaps, Dr. LaHue will investigate the following specific aims in a prospective cohort of older adults with acute mTBI: (1) identify whether biological age metrics are associated with post-traumatic delirium, (2) identify whether post- traumatic delirium is associated with longitudinal cognitive and physical function, and (3) determine the association between biological age, delirium, and longitudinal clinical outcomes. The findings will illuminate vulnerable subgroups that may benefit from targeted acute delirium management, inform clinical guidance for patients at risk for impaired recovery, and lay the foundation for a multicenter study to uncover mechanistic links between TBI, specific biological aging pathways, and delirium to inform future therapeutics."
10973464,"Abstract
 Asian Americans (AAs) have a distinct pattern of underutilization of mental health services,
characterized by delayed onset of treatment and higher attrition rates. Many depressed AAs experience
distressing somatic symptoms and focus on these symptoms more than on emotional symptoms. Depressed
patients with somatic distresses have been found to have approximately twice the outpatient and inpatient
medical care utilization and twice the annual medical care costs than non-somatizing patients. Yet, there is no
effective treatment for patients with co-occurring depression and distressing somatic symptoms. According to
embodied cognition frameworks, the mind influences the body and vice versa. Emotions impact somatic
sensations, and physical movements and shapes also impact emotions, such that integrating emotion-focused
“top-down” mind-body interventions with body-focused “bottom-up” mind-body interventions may optimize the
effectiveness of existing treatments. In this study, we leverage the embodied cognition framework to integrate
the Stress Management and Resiliency Training (SMART), a cognitive and emotion-focused, sedentary
intervention, with Qigong/Tai Chi (QTC), a somatic-focused, mind-body movement intervention, to develop
SMART-QTC, a holistic treatment for AAs with depression and distressing somatic symptoms. Guided by the
ORBIT model for developing behavioral treatments, we propose to develop and pilot test SMART-QTC
intervention for AAs with co-occurring major depressive disorder (MDD) and distressing somatic symptoms by:
(1) recruiting AAs patients with co-occurring MDD and somatic symptoms, and recruiting a stakeholder
advisory board, to identify needs, preferences, and key intervention components, (2) develop an integrated
SMART-QTC treatment manual, and (3) test feasibility and acceptability of the intervention in a pilot
randomized trial (RCT). The proposed project will provide new scientific knowledge to develop a future efficacy
trial of SMART-QTC for AAs with co-occurring MDD and distressing somatic symptoms, which will inform
future research on the development of combined psychological and physical movement interventions for other
culturally diverse populations and conditions."
10973344,"Project Summary
This is a feasibility trial testing music listening as an intervention for mental health recovery after stroke. Stroke 
disproportionally affects older individuals and is the second largest cause of death and the third leading cause 
of disability world-wide, with 75% of survivors suffering from motor impairments and more than 30% suffering 
from mental health problems (Lawrence et al., 2001; Hacket and Pickels, 2014). While worse mental health after 
stroke is related with higher risk of long-term disability and higher mortality rate (Jorgensen et al., 2016; Medeiros 
et al., 2020; Blöchl et al. 2019; Shi et al., 2017), there is a lack of affordable, easy to deliver, and accessible
interventions with minimal side effects that improve mental health in the chronic stage of stroke (Allida et al., 
2020). Intentional music listening (IML) refers to the active practice of listening to music (i.e., paying attention to 
the music without engaging in other activities). IML is one of the most popular leisure activities that people use 
to upregulate their mood (Dingle et al., 2021; Linnemann et al., 2015). In stroke, preliminary studies show that 
IML has the potential to reduce depression and anxiety at the acute stage of stroke (Särkämö et al., 2008, 2014; 
Le Danseur et al., 2019; Baylan et al., 2016). However, these preliminary studies suffer from multiple limitations, 
including small sample sizes and the lack of an objective measure of treatment dose (e.g., time engaged in IML, 
acoustic properties of the music listened to). Therefore, research has yet to provide a neuromechanistic account 
of whether and how IML improves mental health outcomes in stroke. Moreover, there are no studies assessing 
the effects of IML at the chronic stage of stroke, when long-term mental health ailments keep increasing the risk 
of disability and mortality (Jorgensen et al., 2016). Here we propose a feasibility trial testing a remote IML 
intervention in chronic stroke that is guided by the NIH Music-based Intervention Toolkit and that includes an 
objective measure of treatment dose. Our neuromechanistic framework builds connections between clinical and 
basic research and borrows the notion of “enriched environment” from animal models of stroke rehabilitation: 
increased motor, sensory, cognitive, and social contexts promote brain plasticity and recovery after brain injury 
(Matsumori et al., 2006; Söderström et al., 2009; Johansson and Belichenko, 2002). This feasibility trial will pave 
the way for future large-scale clinical trials testing whether and how IML provides an optimal enriched 
environment for mental health recovery in chronic stroke. Across two aims, we develop and test the feasibility of 
the proposed IML intervention for chronic stroke. The studies will help to validate the NIH Music-based 
Intervention Toolkit’s guiding principles and will generate pilot data to design future large-scale clinical trials that 
use IML as an intervention for brain disorders of aging."
10972735,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The purpose of this K76 career development award is to support Dr. Fullard’s long-term career goal of becoming
an independent clinician-scientist focused on improving shared decision-making for older adults with neurologic
disease, including those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI is common in older adults and can present
unique challenges to shared decision-making. In this proposal, we will examine decision-making in MCI using
Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery in people with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and MCI as a model. MCI is
common in PD and is especially pertinent to decision-making because it affects executive function, verbal
memory and processing speed, domains that are associated with the ability to weigh risks and benefits and
appreciate the consequences of a decision. In addition, people with MCI exhibit higher decisional conflict and
report more decision regret compared to their healthy counterparts, making this an ideal population for a decision
support intervention. The overall objective of this proposal is to examine the approach to decision-making for PD
patients with MCI and to improve decisional outcomes using a decision aid that addresses cognitive weaknesses.
The central hypothesis is that decisional conflict and decision quality will improve after exposure to the decision
aid. The specific aims for this proposal are to: 1) adapt and refine a DBS decision aid for PD patients with MCI
considering DBS surgery, 2) evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of the decision
aid for PD patients referred for DBS evaluation, and 3) evaluate implementation of the decision aid guided by
the RE-AIM framework. To achieve these aims, semi-structured interviews will be performed with 30 dyads of
patients with and without MCI and their care partners who have gone through the DBS evaluation process in
order to gain an in-depth understanding of the decision-making process and MCI-specific decisional needs.
Insights from these interviews will be used to adapt and refine our existing DBS decision aid to address cognitive
weaknesses in MCI. A pragmatic, randomized controlled pilot trial will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability
of the decision aid for PD patients undergoing DBS evaluation. The research aims are accompanied by a training
plan designed to address gaps in the candidate’s knowledge and prepare her to become an independent
clinician-scientist and leader in shared decision-making interventions for older adults with neurologic disease.
The training aims for this proposal are to: 1) gain expertise in mixed methods, 2) become proficient in pragmatic
clinical trial design, and 3) gain experience in implementation science. These aims will be achieved through
didactic coursework, workshops, attendance at scientific meetings, practical experience, and direct mentoring.
The candidate is mentored by experts in shared decision-making, mixed methods, neuropsychology, pragmatic
clinical trial design and implementation science. Completion of these research and training aims will result in an
MCI-sensitive intervention designed to improve decisional outcomes that will be tested for effectiveness in a
future R01 and will serve as a model for similar interventions for older adults with neurologic disease and MCI."

As large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) continue to yield now thousands of genomic loci
robustly associated with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) and schizophrenia (SCZ), the major defining challenge of the post-GWAS era is to characterize the
concrete biological mechanisms through which this polygenic variation confers disease risk, at scale. To this
end, we and others have recently developed methods and resources for systematic integration of GWAS results
with population-level functional genomic reference panels -- identifying isoform-regulation during the second
trimester of human brain development as mediating the greatest proportion of heritability across multiple
neuropsychiatric GWAS studies compared with earlier or postnatal timepoints. Yet, no studies have
characterized genetic regulation of alternative polyadenylation (APA) in the developing brain, a critical yet
understudied tissue-specific gene-regulatory mechanism with established roles in neuronal mRNA metabolism,
subcellular trafficking, and cellular differentiation. Our preliminary data indicates widespread dysregulation of
APA in stem-cell-based models and postmortem brain tissues from subjects with ASD and SCZ, as well an
outsized enrichment of psychiatric GWAS signal with APA quantitative trait loci (QTL) in the developing human
brain. This proposal seeks to integrate large-scale functional genomics, single-cell and long-read sequencing,
deep learning, and genome-editing in human neuronal stem-cell models to develop a detailed, mechanistic
understanding of APA regulation during human brain development and its contribution to neuropsychiatric
disorder pathophysiology. Specifically, we will generate a comprehensive atlas of APA regulation across
neurodevelopment, leveraging data from >3650 bulk tissue samples as well as single-nucleus RNAseq data
across >700 unique donors, including 170 with SCZ/ASD. We will train and validate a deep learning model
predicting APA changes from primary sequence. Through integration with psychiatric GWAS, we hypothesize
that APA regulation will provide substantially greater resolution to detect candidate biological mechanisms
underlying psychiatric GWAS loci. Finally, predicted SNP-UTR-disease mechanisms will be experimentally
tested via high-throughput screens and genome-engineering in iPSC-derived neurons. Together, these studies
will systematically characterize a critical, yet underexplored area of genomic regulation in the human brain across

neurobiological targets for therapeutic development and intervention."
10954052,"Summary
 Phosgene gas has been used as a terrorist weapon, in warfare and has injured many Americans in
transportation or industrial accidents. Phosgene targets the lungs, causing severe edema and lung injury after
inhalation, with high lethality in exposure victims. Despite these devastating effects, no mechanism-based
treatment for phosgene injury has been developed.
 The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a key role in cardiopulmonary homeostasis.
However, RAAS is dysregulated during acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) contributing to underlying
pathophysiology. Pro-resolving mediators that are generated during the inflammation cascade are short-lived
due to degradation by an enzyme called soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). Several pulmonary studies showed that
inhibition of sEH ameliorated the study outcomes. In our preliminary studies, we noted both dysregulation of
RAAS and pro-resolving epoxides after phosgene inhalation. We found that administration of angiotensin-
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as Captopril, Enalapril, or Lisinopril improved survival rate, decreased
pulmonary protein leak, and diminished bronchoalveolar inflammatory cell counts. Similarly, when soluble
epoxide hydrolase inhibitors (sEHIs) were administered to mice after phosgene inhalation, the survival rate
significantly improved. Therefore, targeting RAAS and sEH seems to be highly promising. In this application,
based on our strong preliminary data, we hypothesize that targeting the RAAS, including angiotensin-
converting enzyme (ACE) and aldosterone, and stimulating resolution pathways by administration of soluble
epoxide hydrolase inhibitors (sEHIs) post phosgene exposure ameliorates lung injury, leading to decreased
morbidity and improved recovery.
 The following aims are proposed: Aim 1: Screen the efficacy of RAAS modulators and sEHIs in mouse
models of phosgene gas-induced lung injury. Aim 2: Determine the pharmacokinetics of the lead drug candidate
and test the efficacy in a 48-hour observation model of swine phosgene gas-induced lung injury. Aim 3:
Determine therapeutic efficacy of the lead candidate in an extended 28-day observation swine model of
phosgene-induced lung injury.
 Successful completion of the proposed work will provide pivotal information on the development of
targeted treatment to protect against phosgene gas-induced lung injuries – a critical unmet need, and will
prepare us for Biomedical Research Development Authority (BARDA)-enabling studies and eventual FDA
approval under the animal rule."
10954351,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, affects up to 20% of children and is associated with significant physical,
emotional, and social morbidity. Up to one-third of children with atopic dermatitis have moderate-to-severe
disease and require systemic medications to achieve adequate disease control. While systemic therapies for
pediatric atopic dermatitis were historically limited and consisted of broadly immunosuppressive medications
such as methotrexate, highly efficacious and targeted systemic treatments, such as dupilumab and oral Janus
kinase inhibitors, have recently emerged. However, the optimal treatment for any individual child remains
uncertain, as real-world data on the long-term effectiveness and safety of both novel and traditional systemic
medications for pediatric atopic dermatitis remain sparse. Thus, comparative effectiveness research (CER) is
critically needed to fill these current knowledge gaps. Since new treatments for atopic dermatitis continue to
rapidly emerge and traditional randomized trials are often lengthy and expensive, pragmatic trials and
observational studies may be more efficient for CER in pediatric populations and nimbler in adapting to the
expanding treatment landscape for atopic dermatitis. The growth of large clinical research networks, such as
the national Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORnet), also provides opportunities to
leverage real-world data to conduct CER in pediatric atopic dermatitis. However, before such efforts can be
undertaken, tools to easily and accurately identify children with atopic dermatitis within clinical research
networks must be developed and methods to utilize observational data for CER in a way that ensures valid
inferences must be employed. To meet these needs, this proposal has two specific aims: (1) develop and
validate computable phenotypes for pediatric atopic dermatitis, and (2) apply a target trial emulation framework
to compare the effectiveness and safety of dupilumab and methotrexate for atopic dermatitis treatment.
Utilizing routinely-collected electronic health data held in the PCORnet common data model, this project will
apply machine learning approaches to develop validated computable phenotypes for pediatric atopic
dermatitis, including those distinguishing moderate-to-severe disease from mild disease, using structured data
elements. In the target trial emulation comparing new pediatric users of dupilumab or methotrexate for atopic
dermatitis, this project will test the hypothesis that dupilumab is associated with fewer topical medication
prescriptions, lower rates of systemic treatment switching or intensification, and lower rates of adverse effects
compared to methotrexate. This research will enable the efficient conduct of future pragmatic trials in pediatric
atopic dermatitis and provide preliminary data for large, multi-center observational CER studies that will be the
focus of future R01 applications. Ultimately, the findings from this proposal will help to meet the long-term goal
of generating an evidence base to guide systemic treatment selection for children with atopic dermatitis."
10949281,"Human behavior is fundamentally contextual. For instance, the same person will put produce onto the shelves of a grocery store if they are at work, while they take produce off the shelves if they are shopping for dinner. Impairment of contextual behaviors are hallmarks of numerous neurological disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and addictive behavior. Understanding how the brain performs contextual behavior in health may be crucial to understanding the root causes of such disorders. One hypothesis is that contextual behavior is supported by modular neural representations in relevant sensory and decision-making brain areas, where the coordinated activity of a population of neurons is confined to specific subspaces that correspond to each context. This highly structured form of neural representation has been associated with contextual behavior before. However, it is not always associated with contextual behavior; instead, contextual behavior is sometimes associated with unstructured but high-dimensional neural representations. I hypothesize that the history of task learning shapes whether unstructured or modular geometry emerges and that the learned geometry then shapes the learning of further contextual tasks. I propose to test this hypothesis through a combination of mathematical theory, artificial neural network modeling, and analysis of neural population recordings from non-human primates.

In Aim 1, I will determine when and why modular relative to unstructured representations emerge to support contextual behavior by building a theory of this emergence using artificial neural networks, and then testing the predictions of this theory in neural population recordings from sensory and decision-making brain regions as animals learn a sequence of contextual behaviors. In Aim 2, I will determine how modular relative to unstructured representations support the learning of future contextual behaviors – again by building a theory with artificial neural networks to be tested in non-human primate data. In Aim 3, I will determine how the flexibility of contextual behavior can come at the cost of behavioral precision across many different contexts, using a combination of mathematical theory and further analysis of additional neural population recordings. Together, these aims will elucidate the functional principles underlying large-scale modular organization in neural systems. Further, they will provide insight into how behavioral history influences both the performance of existing and the learning of novel contextual behaviors.

During the K99 phase of this research program, I will be located at the Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute at Columbia University. My primary mentor, Dr. Stefano Fusi, will provide me with specific training in computational and theoretical neuroscience. My co-mentor, Dr. Roozbeh Kiani, will provide me with additional training in systems neuroscience and relevant analysis techniques. Their mentorship through this project and the extensive career development resources at the Zuckerman Institute will allow me to complete my training and begin my independent faculty career as a theoretical neuroscientist at a major research university."
10953904,"Abstract:
Pelizaeus Merzbacher Disease (PMD) is a rare X-linked hypomyelinating leukodystrophy caused
by pathogenic variants in PLP, which encodes proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1) and the estimated
prevalence is 1.9 per 100,000 male births in the United States. PMD affected individuals are
currently anecdotally and empirically classified as severe (typically conatal in onset), classic or
mild but understanding surrounding early determination of disease subtype remains a critical gap
and cannot be predicted from genotype. An existing PMD validated Functional Disability Rating
Scale enables stratification of PMD by severity, but due to its age dependence and significant
floor effect, it is insufficient to discriminate severity in the context of clinical trials. As therapies
emerge for PMD, there is an urgent need for tools to discriminate disease severity in PMD early
in the disease course, which is often the optimum window for clinical trial enrollment. To address
this urgent need for a clinically informed tool, our team has established a natural history study to
collect data such as age at onset of disease and key medical events. We propose to use this
deep existing natural history data in the context of a rigorous tool-development approach. The
CHOP Leukodystrophy Center of Excellence (CHOP LCE) is uniquely suited to addressing this
gap in clinical readiness for PMD. As the data integration core for the Rare Disease Clinical
Research Network (RDCRN) funded Global Leukodystrophy Initiative Clinical Trials Network
(GLIA-CTN), the CHOP LCE has collected data on over 60 individuals affected by PMD across
the severity spectrum and curated for phenotypic and genotypic characteristics. Our team will be
able to leverage this data to support the development of an empirically developed PMD severity
scale with face and construct validity (Aim 1). We will then validate this scale prospectively in a
cohort of 30 PMD affected individuals defining its feasibility, reliability and criterion validity, and
determine context of use for future clinical trials (Aim 2). This approach will yield a validated
Clinician Reported Outcome (ClinRO) in the form of a PMD clinical severity marker, which can be
used in the context of imminent clinical trials as a tool for cohort stratification and monitoring of
longitudinal changes in disease severity."
10953908,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT …
Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is a life-saving therapy for people with severe heart and lung
failure, and its use as therapeutic support continues to increase in the United States. However, acute brain injury
(ABI) commonly occurs during this intervention, often leading to considerable disability or even death. Currently,
we lack a solid understanding of why ABI occurs during ECMO, although previous research has implicated the
potential impacts of carbon dioxide (CO2) regulation on cerebral physiology. For example, we do not have a good
understanding of the sequelae resulting from the rapid physiologic changes that accompany ECMO support in
the first 24 hours of treatment, when refractory cardiopulmonary failure in these patients is being rapidly reversed.
These patients frequently experience severe acidosis and hypercapnia prior to cannulation, which is rapidly
reversed upon ECMO initiation by adjusting sweep gas flow across the oxygenator membrane. The proposed
research aims to address this evidence gap, by improving our understanding of the early physiologic changes
that impact outcomes after ECMO initiation. We hypothesize that the acute △PaCO2, which often
accompanies the initiation of ECMO with its rapid correction of PaCO2, causes cerebral vasoconstriction
resulting in a substantial decrease in cerebral oxygen delivery and ABI. The rationale for our hypothesis is
that CO2 is a potent cerebral vasodilator and prolonged hypercapnia can impair cerebral autoregulation. Our
preliminary data provide convincing evidence that △PaCO2 represents a major mechanism for ABI in ECMO
patients, leading to poor long-term neurological and psychiatric outcomes. Our data also show that bedside
detection of ABI is feasible using readily available low-field portable brain MRI and brain injury plasma biomarkers.
Our proposed research, the DELTA ECMO ABI study (Assessing Acute Brain Injury after Rapid Reduction of
PaCO2 upon ECMO Cannulation using Portable MRI and Biomarkers) uses an innovative neuroimaging system
and plasma biomarkers to test our central hypothesis that higher peri-cannulation △PaCO2 is associated with
ABI, leading to poor long-term neuropsychiatric outcomes. We will prospectively enroll ECMO patients and
collect multiple arterial blood gas samples (every 4 hours) 24 hours pre- and post-cannulation. ABI will be
diagnosed by early low-field portable brain MRI at 24 and 72 hours along with the assessment of elevated plasma
biomarker levels and cerebral autoregulation. We will investigate whether the magnitude of peri-cannulation
ΔPaCO2 is associated with cerebral perfusion autoregulatory dysfunction and ABI (Aim 1); and whether the
presence of ABI is associated with worse 6-month neuropsychiatric outcomes (Aim 2). Our proposed research
is a high-reward project that holds significant potential to change clinical practice, by investigating an innovative
hypothesis utilizing a unique approach. Our research can significantly advance the understanding of ECMO-
associated ABI, setting the stage for the development of future approaches aimed at mitigating ABI as a
complication of ECMO therapy."

10954196,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cancer is a metabolically heterogeneous disease. At the core of most metabolic pathways, mitochondria play
central roles in cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, metastasis and therapeutic resistance. Due to
significant amount of somatic and germline mutations, cancer-relevant modifications in mitochondria are found.
While some mitochondrial modifications provide aggressive advantages to cancer cells, others are detrimental.
More understandings of how cancer cells manipulate mitochondrial modifications, replenish mitochondrial
repertoire, and regulate mitochondria related metabolisms would therefore hold great promises to tackle
cancer down. Supported by our preliminary work, we hypothesize that a small population of cancer cells, the
cancer stem cells (also known as cancer initiating cells), can horizontally transfer their mitochondria to
macrophages. Due to the predisposed modifications in mitochondria of cancer stem cells, we further
hypothesize that these cancer stem cells derived mitochondria could rewire metabolic pathways in
macrophages thus leading to alternative activation of macrophages (M2). The hypotheses will be tested by two
specific aims. We will initially test the reproducibility of the horizontal transfer of mitochondria initiated by
different types of cancers (Aim 1). We will also determine if such mitochondrial transfer is actively conducted
by cancer stem cells or passively achieved via phagocytosis by macrophages (Aim1). Once the mitochondria
of cancer stem cells are present in macrophages, we will examine how these mitochondria mask arginine
metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation and reactive oxygen species production in macrophages (Aim2).
Additionally, we will determine the polarization spectrum of macrophages in response to the acquisition of
exogenous mitochondria from cancer stem cells (Aim 2). With successful completion of this proposal, the
information collected from this R03 will not only provide new insights of new immune evasion mediated through
the horizontally mitochondrial transfer from cancer stem cells but also present an enticing target for more
effective therapeutic interventions specifically targeting the cancer stem cells or the tumor associated
macrophages. In addition, it may also serve as a proof-of-principle to apply to other types of stromal cells that
may account for other cancer related diseases."
10973548,"Background: One third of post-9/11 Veterans in VHA suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and
among those who initiate Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), up to 70% drop out before receiving an
adequate dose of treatment. Unfortunately, Veterans who drop out prematurely may never receive the most
effective components of CPT. Thus, there is an urgent need to use empirical approaches to identify the most
effective components of CPT, so that CPT can be adapted into a briefer format. The long-term goal of this line
of research is to adapt, test, and implement brief, evidence-based treatment for Veterans with PTSD. The
overall objective of the current application is to adapt CPT into a brief, effective format. The rationale is that
identifying the most effective intervention components and delivering only those components will make CPT
deliverable in a shorter timeframe, thus improving efficiency, reducing drop-out related to poor treatment
response, and ensuring that Veterans receive the most beneficial components of treatment, which will
significantly improve their quality of life.
Significance/Impact: Upon completion of this project, we expect to have produced an empirically-based, brief
version of CPT. This contribution is likely to improve clinical practice for Veterans with PTSD by providing the
most effective components at an earlier session, thus increasing the overall effectiveness of treatment and
mitigating the negative consequences of untreated PTSD, such as lost productivity, substance use, later-life
physical disability, reduced quality of life, and increased risk of suicide.
Innovation: The status quo for PTSD treatment is lengthy psychotherapy in a specialty mental health setting,
which is rarely delivered in its entirety. The proposed research is innovative because it will use a novel
engineering-inspired framework, the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST), to adapt this effective
psychotherapy into a brief format. Developing a brief, empirically-based version of CPT will open new horizons
for PTSD treatment by expanding CPT access to treatment settings where lengthier treatments are not
feasible. It will also provide effective options for Veterans who desire a briefer treatment course.
Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Using a highly efficient experimental design, identify which of five CPT
components contribute meaningfully to reduction in PTSD symptoms. We will test the effectiveness of each
component and each two-way interaction between components. Specific Aim 2: Identify mediators of
component effectiveness. We hypothesize that effects will be mediated by engagement/adherence and change
in posttraumatic cognitions. Exploratory Aim 1: Identify moderators of component effectiveness.
Methodology: The MOST is an innovative engineering-inspired framework that uses an optimization trial to
assess the performance of individual intervention components within a multicomponent intervention such as
CPT. Guided by the MOST framework, the goal of the proposed project is to empirically inform an abbreviated
version of CPT via a highly efficient fractional factorial design. Veterans (N = 270) at two VAMCs with clinically
significant PTSD symptoms who meet minimal inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive one or
more CPT components. This design will test the effectiveness of each component and each two-way
interaction between components, as measured by PTSD symptom reduction on the Clinician-administered
PTSD scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) across six months of follow-up.
Implementation/Next Steps: Upon completion of these aims, our expected outcome is an adapted,
abbreviated version of CPT that consists of the most effective elements of the intervention. The adapted
intervention will be primed for a future large scale, fully powered effectiveness trial. The adapted intervention
can be easily disseminated through the VA CPT training program and will have a positive impact on the health
and wellbeing of Veterans with PTSD."
10972862,"Project Summary
Surgical treatment via ventriculoperitoneal shunt or endoscopic 3rd ventriculostomy is currently the most
commonly used strategy to treat pediatric hydrocephalus. However, shunt-treated hydrocephalic patients
continue to experience significant lifelong neurological problems and high malfunctioning shunt replacement
surgery rates. The endoscopic choroid plexus (ChP) coagulation helps manage cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
volume by surgically removing the primary CSF production organ in the brain ventricles. However, this surgical
procedure requires neurosurgeons with extensive training and still achieves only partial ChP removal. This
study aims to evaluate a novel, potent, and less invasive ChP ablation tool in human ChP organoids and
rodent brains that can support new ways of treating neonatal hydrocephalus.
The NIH Funding Opportunity program announcement PAR-21-122 recognizes the unmet need for
translational studies for neurotherapeutics agents for treating neurological or neuromuscular disorders and
new therapeutics. In response to this opportunity, our proposal focuses on developing a new ChP ablation
tool via ChP-specific delivery of a clinically validated suicide gene. By utilizing cutting-edge techniques such
as recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector targeting ChP, human ChP organoids, robust rodent
models of neonatal hydrocephalus, and advanced MRI, including DTI and animal behavior assays, our project
aims to achieve rigorous efficacy and safety studies of this new tool.
The completion of this study will determine (1) pharmacokinetics and off-target effects and (2) the therapeutic
efficacy of this AAV-mediated ChP ablation tool, which has high potential to provide a new strategy for treating
pediatric hydrocephalus."
10973542,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is uniformly fatal with an incidence rate of 2.99-3.23 per 100,000 people. Despite recent
therapeutic advances, our understanding of tumor biology in GBM remains incurable with median survivals of
less than two years. Critical unanswered questions contributing to this dismal prognosis that elude clarification
through traditional analysis of human clinical material or small animal models include i) how does surgical trauma
impact GBM development and adjacent brain tumor microenvironments, ii) what are the unique cellular and
molecular properties of residual infiltrating tumor cells during disease progression, and iii) how do surgically
induced selection pressures generate de novo molecular and cellular heterogeneity not present in unresected
surgical samples. Development of a cure or at least a treatment that would provide significant quality of life
improvements in GBM patients is ultimately limited by the lack of animal models that reproduce the hallmark
features of GBM tumor. Typically, rodent models are used to study GBM; however, rodents differ vastly from
humans (e.g., brain size and complexity), making surgical interventions difficult to simulate. By contrast, the mini-
pig brain is remarkably like the human brain and its larger size permits relevant surgical and imaging studies.
Therefore, we propose to develop a first-in-kind syngeneic (intact immune system) glioma model in mini-pigs to
recapitulate hallmark features of human glioma. Development of this model will support studies heretofore
impossible in rodent models or human patients. Thus far, we have established oncogene activated transformed
pig glioma cell lines from pig brains and confirmed their tumorigenic capabilities in mouse models and onco-
minipigs. In the proposed research, we will determine the optimum engraftment conditions of these oncogene
activated transformed pig cells by implanting them into host pig brain under chronic vs transient
immunosuppressive microenvironment. We will also study the impact of provincial treatment of anti-inflammatory
and immune suppressive drugs. To eliminate any potential impact of immune activation between different donors
and hosts, we will repeat the same approach to induce in vivo viral oncogenesis. The relevance of the proposed
syngeneic pig model will be established through analysis of accepted hallmark MR imaging, stereotactic guided
intracranial surgery, and pathology features of the human disease, followed by immune phenotyping.
Development of a large animal glioma model is expected to facilitate new insight into human glioma biology. As
a first step, we propose to test the hypothesis that mini-pig syngeneic glioma models will recapitulate key features
of the human disease. Further, these models are expected to provide a robust new platform for future studies
not possible in rodent models or practically achievable through analysis of patient-derived material. This includes,
but is not limited to, the evaluation of new therapies, imaging studies, and surgical techniques. Finally,
development of this large animal model will enable not only us, but the larger scientific community, to answer
clinically relevant questions applicable to GBM and other brain metastatic cancers."
10973244,"Project Summary/Abstract
Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) present with numerous deficits in organization, planning,
prioritizing, memory, and materials management (OPM). Yet OPMs are critical to successful academic
performance. There is a particular demand for these OPM skills as children transition to the middle school
environment which is associated with numerous challenges including increased expectations for achievement
and behavior, copious homework assignments, increased demands on organization and planning/time
management, learning that moves from rote tasks to abstract conceptual learning, etc. Not surprisingly, given
their OPM problems and social challenges, children with ASD evidence high levels of academic problems in
middle school. In fact, during middle schools years, the academic performance of youth with ASD is on
average 5 years below their typical peers. Yet there are no evidence-based interventions for middle school
youth with ASD. Using an iterative and collaborative design process, we developed an intervention, Achieving
Independence & Mastery in School (AIMS), for middle-school youth with ASD without intellectual disability (ID).
AIMS has been tailored to address the unique learning styles of youth with ASD. Preliminary evidence
suggests that AIMS improves OPM and that improvements in OPM are associated with improved academic
functioning. As a next step, an adequately powered randomized clinical trial comparing AIMS to an active
comparison control (ACC) is needed to confirm that AIMS engages OPM and that change in OPM is
associated with improvement in academic functioning. Fully included middle school youth with ASD (n=224)
will be randomized to AIMS or ACC. At baseline, post, and two critical school year follow-ups, we will
comprehensively assess OPM and academic outcomes. The aims are to examine the efficacy of AIMS on 1)
improving OPM and 2) academic functioning. We hypothesize that the AIMS group will have higher OPM
scores and improved academic functioning compared to the ACC group at post-intervention (primary endpoint)
and follow-up. The third aim is to assess whether changes in OPM mediate changes in academic functioning.
We hypothesize that the relation between AIMS and academic functioning improvement is mediated by OPM
changes. We will also explore maintenance of OPM gains, determine the optimal time to deliver AIMS, and
identify moderators of treatment success. AIMS has the potential to impact a large number of youths with ASD
since over 50% of the population are fully included in the general education classroom. The lifetime cost for an
individual with ASD is estimated to be $1.4 million/patient with the largest costs for special education and
parental productivity loss. Thus, NICHD ASD research priorities include developing novel treatments delivered
during pivotal transitions (e.g., middle school) to improve outcomes."
10974392,"For millions of patients who suffer from a variety of painful conditions, opioid analgesics can provide decisive pain relief in part by decreasing the aversion normally associated with pain perception (i.e., the characteristic unpleasant quality of pain experience, regardless of etiology). Mechanistically, this analgesia against pain unpleasantness is associated with the binding of opioids to specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the mu opioid receptors, particularly in brain pathways that contribute to the affective-motivational dimension of pain. However, mu opioid receptors are also broadly expressed outside of pain circuits, where opioids produce unacceptably dangerous side effects including addiction and potentially fatal respiratory depression. Crucially, the human genome contains hundreds of other GPCRs with distinct expression profiles. Thus, because GPCRs are highly druggable proteins, developing small molecules that engage non-opioid, non-addictive GPCRs in affective-motivational pain circuits is an attractive strategy to develop safer analgesics that reduce pain unpleasantness more safely and across all pain conditions. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team comprising pain biologists, neuroscientists, physicians, GPCR pharmacologists, and medicinal chemists; advisors with pharmaceutical industry, drug development, intellectual property, and commercialization experience; and representatives from patient advocacy groups. In our previous work, we discovered an ensemble of neurons in the amygdala that encodes pain unpleasantness and demonstrated that interfering with amygdalar neural activity using artificially expressed GPCRs (DREADDs) significantly diminished pain affective- motivational behaviors in mice. We next launched an analgesic target discovery project combining mouse genetic tools, single-cell RNA sequencing, and bioinformatics methods to catalog GPCRs present in the amygdalar neurons active during pain. After generating this catalog, we histologically validated expression of these GPCRs and conducted preliminary antinociceptive efficacy tests, using known GPCR ligands. This work identified an amygdalar GPCR with antinociceptive properties. Furthermore, engagement of this target is not reinforcing in rodents. Although existing ligands were sufficient to demonstrate the antinociceptive potential of this GPCR, our next objective is to develop small molecules with optimized physical, PD, and PK properties. Toward this aim, our team proposes to use medicinal chemistry and computational docking techniques as in our previous study based on the recent resolution of several cryo-EM structures. Further, given that translational efforts can fail due to insufficient understanding of the target biology and its conservation in humans, we will expand our understanding of this GPCR biology by investigating signaling and its distribution in human tissues."
10949284,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite advances across the cervical cancer care continuum – screening, treatment, and survivorship care,
women with social vulnerability (i.e. poverty, rural residence, racial or ethnically underserved), and women with
obesity or type 2 diabetes (T2D) are significantly more likely to die from cervical cancer. Obesity and T2D often
co-occur, and women with social vulnerability i.e., living in poverty, rural areas, and racial/ethnic minoritized
groups, are more likely to be diagnosed with the conditions. Thus, there is a critical need to adapt evidence-
based interventions that address SDoH barriers to engaging in the cervical cancer care continuum among
women with chronic conditions and social vulnerability. Training: I am shifting my research from examining the
etiology of chronic conditions (cancer, obesity, and T2D) and associated health-protective behaviors to
focusing on adapting evidence-based interventions to mitigate cancer outcomes in individuals with chronic
conditions. The proposed K01 career development training builds upon my prior experience by focusing on
three areas that require additional training: (1) Enhance skills in biomedical informatics and biostatistics, (2)
Build skills in developing evidence-based interventions to address cancer disparities, and (3) Develop
expertise in multi-level implementation science theories and methods. Accordingly, the proposed K01 will
provide protected time to receive the necessary training to advance my expertise and propel me to become an
independent implementation scientist focused on improving cancer outcomes in populations living with T2D,
obesity, and social vulnerability. Research: The availability of large real-world health data sets with electronic
health records and claims data provides an opportunity to better identify populations to be targeted for
interventions. We will analyze OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Network data using latent class analysis to
examine which degree combinations of factors (obesity, T2D, or SV) are associated with risk profiles of
cervical cancer diagnosis. We will then use Intervention Mapping to guide the process of adapting the
PINPOINT intervention – (Preventing CervIcal caNcer through HPV self-cOllection and patIent NavigaTion) for
women with high-risk profiles for cervical cancer. The Health Belief Model to understand factors influencing
implementation outcomes. Proctor’s Framework for Implementation Outcomes will be used to evaluate the
PINPOINT intervention. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that the PINPOINT intervention will be
acceptable and feasible in supporting the cervical cancer continuum of care for women with multiple
vulnerabilities. Summary: Findings will inform an R01 grant application to the NCI to test the effectiveness of
the developed intervention in a fully powered sample. By the end of this award, I will develop expertise in
implementation science, positioning myself to become an independent implementation scientist."
10949617,"Symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (KOA) affects an estimated 30 million adults in the U.S. and contributes to more
than $27 billion in annual healthcare costs. The discordance between pain presentation and structural damage
in KOA is a crucial issue that hampers both effective clinical management and development of disease-modifying
therapies. This is in part related to different pain phenotypes (nociceptive, nociplastic and neuropathic-like)
underlying the chronic pain experience in KOA. Structural pathology thought to contribute to nociceptive pain in
KOA include MRI-detected bone marrow lesions (BML), effusion/synovitis, meniscal root tears and extrusion,
and CT-detected intra-articular mineralization. In contrast, in patients with “neuropathic-like” and/or “nociplastic”
pain, those joint alterations are less likely to explain pain. The first aim investigates the relationship between
knee imaging biomarkers (MRI, CT) and pain phenotypes (nociceptive vs. neuropathic-like or nociplastic). The
second aim investigates the relation between pain phenotypes and imaging biomarkers to persistent pain, 6
months post knee replacement. In the third aim, I will attempt to identify the relation of co-existing knee imaging
biomarkers (on MRI and CT) to pain phenotypes. This proposal brings multiple disciplines and fields of expertise
(rheumatology, radiology, pain, psychology and neuroscience) to advance our knowledge on the relationship
between structural damage and pain phenotypes in KOA. This funding opportunity is critical to help me transition
toward independent research and R01 funding. I will have protected time for this project and a highly supportive
academic environment. I will have access to leading experts in the fields outlined above, in addition to formal
coursework and career development series through Harvard Medical School, Harvard T.H. Chan School of
Public Health and the Massachusetts General Hospital. As a musculoskeletal radiologist with strong research
background in imaging biomarkers of KOA, this proposal will provide me with training in advanced epidemiology
and biostatistics, pain research and assessment tools, as well as expertise in conducting clinical investigations
of imaging biomarkers of chronic KOA pain. Successful completion of these aims may lead towards improved
clinical trial designs targeting the “right therapies to the right patient” based on underlying pain phenotypes, and
selection of appropriate structural outcomes related to those phenotypes. Ultimately, this work will enhance the
success of identifying promising treatments for millions of people living with KOA."

predisposed infection remain unclear, few specific targets linking T/HS to elevated risk of sepsis have been
identified. This proposal aims to address this important clinical problem by elucidating a previously unknown
mechanism of T/HS regulation of immunometabolism that predisposes patients to infection. Here, we focus
on the formation of a positive feedback loop for 12(S)-HETE-ALOX15, which is an unusual mechanism for
the metabolite,12(S)-HETE, to upregulate the expression of its rate-limiting enzyme ALOX15.
 Emerging studies have demonstrated the important role of fatty acids (FAs) in the regulation of
inflammation. A previous study identified plasma 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid [12(S)-HETE] as a
biomarker predicting trauma patient mortality, where 12(S)-HETE levels in non-surviving patients with severe
trauma are 5-time higher than those in trauma survivors at the time of hospital admission. 12(S)-HETE is a
metabolite from arachidonic acid (AA) generated by lipoxygenases. ALOX15, a lipoxygenase, is the rate-
limiting enzyme in generating 12(S)-HETE. In our preliminary studies, we observed that 1) 12(S)-HETE
increased host susceptibility to infection following T/HS; 2) 12(S)-HETE induces enhanced ALOX15
expression in macrophages (MPs), which forms a positive feedback loop that leads to enhanced generation
of 12(S)-HETE, augmented MP death, and decreased bacteria clearance; and 3) blocking the feedback loop
by genetic deletion of 12(S)-HETE receptor GPR31 or suppression of ALOX15 increased the bacteria
clearance ability in the lungs and improved the survival rate following post-T/HS infection. Based on these
findings, we hypothesize that the 12(S)-HETE-induced ALOX15 expression forms a positive feedback
loop and serves as a novel mechanism underlying T/HS-predisposed sepsis. Blocking the feedback
loop by ALOX15 inhibitor may present a therapeutic and preventive strategy for T/HS-predisposed
sepsis. We propose two specific aims to test this hypothesis: Aim 1 is to determine the mechanism of 12(S)-
HETE upregulation of ALOX15 expression in T/HS; and Aim 2 is to determine the role of 12(S)-HETE-
ALOX15 feedback loop in the mechanism of T/HS-predisposed sepsis.
 To our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to evaluate the role of the T/HS-induced 12(S)-HETE-
ALOX15 feedback loop in infection and sepsis susceptibility. We reason that the metabolite-enzyme
feedback loop may represent an unexplored mechanism of T/HS-primed infection. Understanding this
mechanism may provide a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of post-T/HS sepsis."

Single-cell spatial technologies hold the promise of understanding spatially-resolved cell state and discovering
how cells interact locally to create complex tissues and organisms. In contrast to bulk sequencing or disassoci-
ated cells, with spatial genomic data we may catalog the diversity of cells and cellular environments in healthy
and diseased tissues, characterize cell types and healthy variation in cell state and cellular collectives, and study
the effects of local environment on cell state. However, spatial genomics technologies also pose important
challenges to analytic methods, specifically, they have small fields-of-view, they are hard to normalize and align
across samples, and there are limited genomic markers assayed.
This proposal aims to construct queryable, multiscale, reference-free, annotated 3D tissue atlases to study how
cells organize into tissues using 2D slices from spatial genomics technologies such as MERFISH, Slide-seqV2,
MIBI, or even histology images. These 3D tissue atlases will allow us to align spatial genomics data and
disassociated single-cell data to a 3D coordinate system. The atlases may be queried at specific 3D coordinates,
within regions of interest, or for specific cell types for expected values of genomic markers. The atlases will be
annotated with landmarks noting regions of interest, with genomic markers to identify those regions.
Our objectives are to develop methods that build 3D tissue atlases from 2D spatial genomics samples with-out
reference coordinate systems, to validate these methods by building and annotating 3D atlases for mouse heart,
mouse brain, and human glioblastoma tumors using existing data, and, to identify the local influence of each
aligned cell in the atlases. We will rely heavily on our expertise in Gaussian processes to infer smooth functions
across spatial coordinates. The resulting atlases are able to capture cell-type specific relationships, spatial
differential expression, regions of interest, and landmarks, allow integration of multimodal data and robust
imputation of missing data, and are flexible with respect to biological scale, resolution, and field-of-view.
To accomplish these goals, in aim one, we will develop methods to build and annotate referencefree, queryable,
multiscale 3D tissue atlases from 2D spatial genomics samples. In aim two, for validation, we will build atlases
with existing data for developing mouse heart, adult mouse brain, and human glioblastoma tumors. We will
develop an experimental design module to allow users to robustly design their own tissue atlas with min-imal
spatial genomics samples, and create a software package including a graphical user interface to visualize,
explore, and analyze atlases. In aim three, we will build methods to identify the regions of local influence of each
cell and cell type in an atlas. All methods will be available in GitHub through a user-friendly package. The three
atlases will be publicly available to allow data alignment and searches or queries. We hope to create methods
that allow single labs on limited budgets to build and study 3D tissue atlases for their tissue of interest."

10974395,"ABSTRACT
Research Component (RC) 1 includes the validation of novel therapeutic targets for pain and the study of their
biology. In our previous work, we discovered an ensemble of neurons in the amygdala that encodes pain
unpleasantness across pain modalities (heat, cold, mechanical) and pain types (acute, chronic neuropathic).
Furthermore, altering the activity of these amygdalar neurons using artificially expressed GPCRs (DREADDs,
Roth lab) significantly diminished pain affective-motivational behaviors in mice, in both acute and chronic
neuropathic pain models, and without altering withdrawal reflexes, anxiety or reward. Consequently, engaging a
target in the nociceptive amygdalar neurons that produce pain unpleasantness may be an effective approach to
manage many, if not all, pain types, including those with different peripheral localizations and mechanisms, those
of CNS origin, and even those for which we lack sufficient mechanistic understanding to treat the pain at its
source. Building on these exciting findings, we launched an analgesic target discovery project in which we
combined mouse genetic tools, single-cell RNA sequencing, and bioinformatics methods to label, sequence, and
catalog GPCRs present in nociceptive amygdalar neurons. After generating this catalog, we validated expression
of a dozen of GPCRs in the mouse amygdala using spatial transcriptomics. Next, we conducted a behavioral
screen in mice to test the ability of known ligands for these GPCRs, either purchased or synthesized by our
team, to reduce pain affective-motivational behaviors. This screen identified five amygdalar GPCRs with
antinociceptive properties. Among these, we focused our attention on neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) because
previous studies have established that NTSR1 agonists are not rewarding and that engaging NTSR1 can even
reduce addictive behaviors in rodents. Both PD149163, a balanced/unbiased, brain-penetrant neurotensin (NTS)
peptide fragment 8-13 analog, and SBI-553, an NTSR1 negative allosteric modulator (NAM) at Gq and weaker
positive allosteric modulator with intrinsic agonist activity at beta-arrestin (PAM-agonist), reduced pain affective-
motivational behaviors in male mice. However, balanced/unbiased activation of NTSR1 with NTS or PD149163
produces dose-limiting side effects that could both confound antinociceptive readouts and hinder translation. In
contrast, SBI-553 lacks these side effects. We thus continued our evaluation of NTSR1 as an antinociceptive
target with SBI-553, and found that SBI-553 antinociceptive properties were lost in NTSR1 knockout mice,
validating on-target antinociceptive activity. In RC1, we expand validation studies to include other pain models
and further elucidate the biology of our target, NTSR1, focusing on signaling and expression in the human brain,
to inform optimized novel small molecule development and testing in RCs 3–5 and evaluate translation potential.
In Aim 1, we validate NTSR1 antinociceptive properties in mouse models of clinically relevant pain. In Aim 2, we
establish which NTSR1 signaling pathways produce antinociception. In Aim 3, we resolve NTSR1 comparative
expression in mouse and human tissues."
10972763,"SUMMARY
Aging is associated with a decline in the neural substrates and sensorimotor processes subserving speech
motor control. In addition, aging-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease may lead to
severe motor speech impairments. Prior efforts to incorporate known principles of motor learning into motor
speech treatment programs are impeded by the lack of empirical data on how the aging process affects
different forms of speech motor learning at both the behavioral and neural level. In my predoctoral work at the
University of Washington (F99 phase), my dissertation focuses on two distinct forms of speech motor learning:
auditory-motor adaptation and syllable sequence learning. No previous studies have directly compared the
neural bases of these forms of motor learning or investigated how they are affected by aging. The central
hypothesis of this project is that speech adaptation and syllable sequence learning rely largely on distinct
cortical-subcortical networks and, therefore, are differentially affected by the aging process. In Aim 1.1, I
investigate the subcortical contributions to both forms of motor learning by comparing individuals with
Parkinson’s disease who have DBS electrodes implanted in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in the cortico-basal
ganglia circuit, individuals with essential tremor who have DBS electrodes implanted in the ventrolateral
nucleus of the thalamus (Vim) in the cortico-cerebellar circuit, and age-matched control participants. Analyses
are based on both behavioral data from DBS ON/OFF conditions and neural data from a subgroup of patients
whose DBS device allows sensing from the implanted nuclei. In Aim 1.2, I directly study the effects of aging
itself on speech motor learning by using EEG to compare cortical neural activity associated with speech
auditory-motor adaptation and syllable sequence learning in healthy older adults versus healthy younger
adults. In the postdoctoral phase at the University of California San Franciso (K00 phase), I will then further
expand my expertise and skills in aging research as applied to speech neuroscience. In Aim 2, I will focus on
multimodal neuroimaging and computational modeling to investigate how sensorimotor neuronal networks in
the aging brain support different forms of speech motor learning through functional reorganization, and how
such reorganization can be accounted for in computational models of speech motor control. This program of
training and research will prepare me for a productive career in aging research and speech neuroscience.
Findings from the series of studies will advance our understanding of aging-related changes in the speech
sensorimotor system and inform the development of effective behavioral and neuromodulation treatments for
aging-related motor speech disorders."
10954577,"Influenza virus causes significant illness and mortality in the U.S. and worldwide. Vaccines offer
some protection, but must be continuously tailored to mutations of the virus. Some strains of
influenza are resistant to one or more of the limited number of available anti-viral drugs. New
strategies which attack invariant features of the virus are urgently needed. The viral surface
glycoprotein hemagglutinin allows the virus to bind to host cells and enter. Entry depends on
high density clusters of hemagglutinin within the viral membrane, but the mechanism of cluster
formation is unknown. Assembly depends on hemagglutinin co-clustering with other viral
components, including the matrix protein M1, in the host cell plasma membrane. This project will
address the fundamental questions of how hemagglutinin forms clusters, how hemagglutinin
and M1 co-cluster, and the role of host cell components in these key viral processes. We
recently discovered that hemagglutinin and M1 both interact with host cell phosphoinositides,
which are able to control important cell signaling and protein trafficking pathways that have been
implicated previously in infection. This project will investigate the mechanism of interaction
between hemagglutinin, M1, and the phosphoinositides PI4P and PIP2 using super-resolution
microscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations, targeting the
portions of hemagglutinin that are invariant and therefore less likely to mutate over time. Results
will help identify new targets for anti-viral drugs and illuminate how influenza is able to exploit
host cell membrane organization for its own life cycle."
10953829,"Project Summary. In this K76 proposal, I outline a comprehensive 5-year training program that will support my
transition to independence as an emerging leader. The proposal focuses on development and rigorous testing of an
intervention to improve integration of geriatric principles into surgical care of older adults undergoing fecal ostomy
surgery. This significant and innovative plan is directly tied to my training and career development goals. Background:
Fecal ostomy surgery impacts biopsychosocial outcomes of older adults; however, surgeons are not trained to address
geriatric needs that exist among this growing surgical patient population. Developing interventions for surgical teams
(i.e., surgeons, nurses, and medical assistants) to address geriatric needs when facing fecal ostomy surgery is an
unexplored opportunity to improve biopsychosocial outcomes, including quality of life and functional independence, in
this growing patient population. Specific aims and research design: I aim to develop the first version of the Geriatric
Assessment Strategy for Ostomy Management and Adaptation (GA-STOMA) intervention and methodology through 1:1
interviews with older adults 30-90 days after fecal ostomy surgery and care-partners when available (up to N=30) (Aim
1a), with additional input from focus groups of key clinical stakeholders (surgeons, geriatricians, surgical nurses, ostomy
nurses, nutritionists, physical therapists, and social workers) (N=6 focus groups, up to n=24 participants) (Aim 1b). Next,
I will examine usability and acceptability of GA-STOMA via an open pilot (N=16 participants) with exit interviews and pre-
post assessments. GA-STOMA intervention and methodology will be refined (Aim 2). Finally, I will evaluate feasibility of
GA-STOMA in a single arm clinical trial (N=60 patients) at an outpatient surgical clinic following predetermined
benchmarks with a run-in historical control (Aim 3). These findings will inform a hybrid efficacy/effectiveness cluster
randomized clinical trial of GA-STOMA through the R01 mechanisms to determine intervention impact on patient quality
of life. Training: My aims are supported by training goals to develop expertise in: 1) clinical geriatrics; 2) mixed-methods
data integration to inform intervention development and refinement; 3) clinical trial methodology focusing on efficacy
and effectiveness trials; and 4) leadership training. These training goals are support by 1) my expert mentorship team
led by my primary mentor Dr. Christine Ritchie (a geriatrician and palliative care physician with expertise in mixed-
methods research and clinical trials), 2) a rich institutional environment (Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard
Medical School), and 3) targeted coursework, scientific meetings and planned publications. Relevance to NIA: This K76 is
in line with NIA’s 2020-2025 Strategic Directions for Research Goal C, to “develop effective interventions to maintain
health, well-being, and function and prevent or reduce the burden of age-related diseases, disorders, and disabilities”.
Impact: As a surgeon-scientist and emerging leader with expertise in colorectal diseases I recognize the critical need to
improve biopsychosocial outcomes among older adults facing surgery. Experiences gained through this proposal are
foundational to my path to research independence as a national leader at the intersection of geriatrics and colorectal
surgery."
10954327,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Malaria, which results from infection with Plasmodium parasites, is a significant global health problem
with nearly 250 million clinical cases and over 600,000 deaths annually worldwide. With growing anti-malarial
drug and insecticide resistance, new therapeutic strategies and highly effective vaccines are urgently needed.
Protection against symptomatic disease develops after years of repeated exposures to Plasmodium parasites.
However, there is no definitive evidence of long-lived, sterilizing immunity in humans following repeated
exposure to Plasmodium parasites, and clinical immunity to malaria rapidly wanes in the absence of re-
infection. Similarly, the limited protection offered by the most advanced malaria vaccines lose efficacy quickly
in malaria endemic areas. Dysregulated inflammation is thought to contribute to the short-lived response to
Plasmodium. The cellular processes impairing the acquisition and maintenance of cellular and humoral
immunity to Plasmodium are not known. Therapies that boost the robustness and durability of the immune
response could be transformative in vaccine development. This project centers on investigating an IL-15
cytokine-based therapy that enhances the immune response to Plasmodium infection and vaccination.
 The proposed studies will utilize novel peptide:MHC class II and B cell tetramers in experimental
Plasmodium infection and vaccination mouse models. We found that in the context of Plasmodium infection in
mice, IL-15 therapy promotes the differentiation of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, which are critical for promoting
long-lived and high-quality antibody responses. In the context of whole sporozoite Plasmodium vaccination, IL-
15 therapy increases the number of liver-resident CD8 T memory (Trm) cells and antibody levels, suggesting
that IL-15 could be harnessed as an adjuvant to enhance Plasmodium vaccine immunogenicity. In this
proposal, we will define the mechanism by which IL-15 therapy promotes Tfh differentiation as well as germinal
center formation and antibody generation in the context of Plasmodium infection using novel conditional
knockout mouse models and our novel tetramer reagents (Aim 1). We will also define the impact of IL-15
therapy as a vaccine adjuvant to enhance CD8 T cell responses as well as CD4 T cell and B cell/antibody
responses to a whole sporozoite Plasmodium vaccine (Aim 2). These studies will define the mechanistic
pathways induced by IL-15 treatment that enhance Plasmodium control to both understand the disease more
completely and develop therapies that exploit these pathways. Overall, these studies will deliver foundational
knowledge of the naturally-acquired and vaccine-elicited immune response to Plasmodium. This information
will be leveraged for the rational design of vaccination strategies to improve anti-Plasmodium immunity."
10944195,"Project Abstract
 Pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) occurs in >15,000 children annually in the United States, most
of whom do not survive to hospital discharge. As less than 5% of pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(CPR) guideline recommendations are supported by high-quality evidence, there are significant knowledge
gaps regarding optimal resuscitation techniques. Since pediatric IHCA represents a heterogenous process that
results from the progression of many disease states, CPR physiology and the response to therapies also vary
among patients. Therefore, our group has aimed to advance CPR beyond “one-size-fits-all” care and toward
more patient-specific methods with an overarching objective of developing personalized, physiology-directed
CPR strategies that account for both known patient characteristics and real-time physiology.
 A central component of in-hospital CPR is the administration of epinephrine, which is universally
recommended during cardiac arrest to augment systemic vascular resistance, thereby increasing diastolic blood
pressure (DBP) and coronary perfusion pressure to enhance the likelihood of return of spontaneous circulation
(ROSC). Recent laboratory data and our 2023 clinical study identified substantial variability in the DBP
response to epinephrine and found that a more robust increase in DBP after administration of the first dose of
epinephrine is associated with higher rates of ROSC. As data are conflicting regarding ideal dosing strategies
during pediatric IHCA, we postulate that epinephrine is beneficial during CPR in some clinical scenarios and
potentially deleterious in others. Furthering our understanding of this variability in physiologic response will
facilitate the development of methods of personalized, physiology-directed CPR to improve IHCA outcomes.
 Due to limitations in currently available datasets, a prospectively designed study is necessary to address
this topic. Thus, we will leverage the existing infrastructure in 20 sites of the Pediatric Resuscitation Quality
Collaborative (pediRES-Q), a network specifically designed to study IHCA, to prospectively collect extensive
granular data including epinephrine dose timing and physiologic waveforms from bedside monitoring systems.
In Aim 1, we will examine the physiologic response to epinephrine in greater detail and will build on exciting
preliminary data to expand the applicability of this work to patients without invasive monitoring, investigating
the pulse oximetry waveform as a non-invasive marker of CPR physiology and of epinephrine response in
particular. In Aim 2, we will determine how the physiologic response to epinephrine impacts the relationship
between epinephrine dosing strategies and outcomes. Finally, in Aim 3, through a well-established
collaboration with machine learning experts, we will develop models to predict the response to epinephrine
and subsequent CPR outcomes. The successful completion of these aims will expand our understanding of how
epinephrine dosing and resuscitation in general can be tailored to individual patients and will facilitate the
design of future interventional trials of physiology-directed CPR."
10952766,"ABSTRACT
Tobacco use causes one third of cancer-related mortality. Decades of tobacco control progress are threatened
by the promotion and popularity of e-cigarettes (colloquially called “vaping”) by adolescents. Almost a decade
ago, e-cigarettes became the most common tobacco product used by adolescents. In 2022, 2.55 million U.S.
middle and high school students currently used e-cigarettes. Recently new “pod vape” devices have increased
in popularity; they are highly discreet and deliver high levels of nicotine increasing addictive potential.
Adolescent vaping is associated cigarette smoking initiation, and e-cigarette use increases risk of asthma,
adverse cardiovascular effects, and is likely to increase risk of lung cancer. To address this problem, flexible,
scalable evidence-based interventions are needed to help adolescents quit.
However, there are few adolescent interventions for e-cigarette use with rigorous evaluation data. To the best
of our knowledge, no vaping cessation programs are delivered on social media. In 2022, 62% of adolescents
used Instagram, and 50% of adolescents used it at least once a day. We developed the program, “Quit the Hit”
that takes place in direct message groups on Instagram to support cessation among mid to late-stage
adolescents aged 13-21. The program was co-created with hundreds of adolescents and has been evaluated
in a randomized controlled trial. Preliminary data show significantly higher end of program abstinence rate in
the intervention arm than in the control (52% vs. 35%). Quit the Hit is promoted using social media advertising
and it is administered by expert facilitators. To expand the reach and assess the effectiveness of the Quit
the Hit, we propose to develop and evaluate a scalable version, the Quit the Hit Toolkit (QTHT) that can be
implemented by school districts, community organizations, and other groups. We propose three Aims.
Aim 1. Adapt the Quit the Hit Toolkit (QTHT) for implementation by youth serving organizations, assessing
organizational needs and capacities to implement the program, training materials and supports for providers,
and resources and guides for promotion and adoption. Aim 2. Evaluate the effectiveness of the QTHT
implemented with community partner organizations in a parallel-arm randomized controlled trial. Aim 3.
Document and Assess the implementation of the QTHT including treatment fidelity and adaptations,
organizational capacity, facilitators/barriers to implementation, and types of technical assistance needed to
sustain the intervention. We will evaluate the implementation using the RE-AIM framework.
We will use a Type 1 Hybrid Effectiveness/Implementation Design that speeds translation from research to
practice by enabling us to test the intervention’s effectiveness while also gathering information on its potential
for large scale implementation in diverse settings. We have established partnerships with state health
departments, the California State Board of Education, and the Stanford Tobacco Prevention Toolkit which has
reached over 2.7 million youth for future dissemination."
10952278,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The human genome and that of its experimental surrogate, the mouse, contain a haploid DNA content of
approximately three gigabase pairs (3 X 109 bp) and an estimated 20,000 genes. Interrogating this complex
landscape of genes and developing community resources around them have traditionally involved modifying the
genome on a gene-by-gene and resource-by-resource basis with tremendous effort and at great cost. For
example, to create an animal resource containing a knockout of each mouse gene, the International Mouse
Knockout Consortium has had to target each of 20,000 unique sequences at a combined cost of close to $1
billion (USD). Contributing to the funding and labor burden is the fact that each experiment is dependent upon
the technically challenging and labor-intensive microinjection of DNAs into fertilized oocytes, or embryonic stem
cells into early developmental stage mouse blastocysts. Creating even a second, new genome-wide resource
based on each of 20,000 genes could conceivably require repeating the costly process yet again.
 To move beyond the one-by-one approach for developing genome-wide resources, outlined/envisioned in
this proposal, is a powerful combinatorial technology to sequentially marry functional DNA sequences (encoding,
for example, reporters, recombinases, cell-ablating toxins, protein interaction domains, and nucleases) to each
of thousands of unique mouse genes already marked with a uniform (lacZ-) sequence tag.
 The potential for a breakthrough in genome analysis studies at the heart of the proposal comes from the
combination of two powerful and proven technologies — first, Prime Editing, a CRISPR technology employing
Reverse Transcriptase to insert DNA sequences at points of DNA modification; and second, expression of Prime
Editing machinery directly from the genome (rather than administering it exogenously).
 The key aspect of the proposed experiments is to exploit the exquisite specificity of Prime Editing to guide
the reverse transcription of pegRNA edits/cargoes to multiple, specific, previously (e.g., lacZ-) tagged loci.
Importantly, successful Prime Editing from specific pegRNAs will afford the opportunity to distribute novel
functional sequences to thousands of mouse genes without any need for the costly, time-consuming
microinjection of zygotes or embryonic stem cells.
 Full implementation of such as system has the potential to accelerate the development, increase the number,
and decrease the cost of mouse genome-wide resources by orders of magnitude, and to move strain
development efforts from a gene-by-gene method to a more massively parallel approach. The combinatorial
nature of the technology and the adaptability of the system to incorporate the latest in new technological
developments will allow a longstanding contribution to human health."

The proposed University of Mississippi (UM) Botanical Dietary Supplements Research Center (BDSRC) is 
focused on filling in knowledge gaps related to the potential for the Spirulina-based product, ImmulinaTM, to 
promote resilience against and/or recovery from influenza and, by extension, other respiratory viral infections. 
During the 2017-18 reporting year in the U.S. alone, influenza resulted in 959,000 patient hospitalizations and 
79,400 deaths.
The UM BDSRC will be composed of an Administration Core, a Botanical Core, and two research projects. 
Project 2, Evaluation of ImmulinaTM Oral Supplement for Host Resistance to Influenza Virus Infection, will be 
directed by Gailen Marshall, MD, PhD, Professor and Executive Director of the Mississippi Clinical Research 
and Trials Center at UM Medical Center. Working closely with him will be Khalid Ashfaq, PhD, DVM, DTVM.
Project 2 is designed to include studies utilizing both mouse models (Years 1-2) and biomarker-based 
human models (Years 3-5) aimed at establishing the impact of ImmulinaTM supplementation on increasing host 
resilience against the pathogenic effects of influenza virus infection. It will investigate the following 
hypothesis: ImmulinaTM given in its optimal oral form will alter the host antiviral immune response, manifested 
by increases in NK cell numbers and/or activity, anti-flu H and N antibody titers, and CD8+ cytotoxic T 
lymphocytes (CTL) against flu-infected cells. 
To investigate our hypothesis, we will achieve the following specific aims:
1. Evaluate oral administration of ImmulinaTM in three non-lethal mouse models of resilience against influenza 
A virus infection (prophylaxis, prodrome and recovery) to determine the most effective utility of ImmulinaTM
for enhancing host immunity to improve antiviral resilience; 
2. Confirm that activation of the TLR2 signaling pathway by Braun-type lipoproteins is a primary causal 
mechanism through which ImmulinaTM enhances host immunity against antiviral infection; 
3. Determine the optimal form and dosage of the ImmulinaTM-based supplement in the human model that will 
maximize effects on increasing NK cell numbers and/or activity, increased supporting cytokines (IL-15, ILγ2, IGNg), influenza-specific antibody titers and CTL numbers; 
4. Establish the timeline for optimal NK, cytokine, antibody and CTL responses in terms of both initial changes 
and maximal changes and duration of the change once the ImmulinaTM is discontinued in normal and 
immune compromised (elderly) human research participants; and 
5. Examine the effects of routine influenzas vaccine given before, during, or after ImmulinaTM use to 
investigate influenza antigen-specific immune responses in individuals receiving ImmulinaTM supplement vs 
placebo."
10945941,"Genetically engineered mammalian cells have demonstrated enormous clinical potential, especially as cancer
therapy. Also, immune cells equipped with a single-input reporter circuit for tumor detection can achieve higher
sensitivity than traditional imaging and blood-based diagnostics in mice, thus highlighting their potential as diag-
nostic devices. While promising, a major challenge in cell-based therapeutics and diagnostics is sensitivity. As
such, installing signal amplification genetic circuits will greatly improve the sensitivity and performance of cell-
based devices. Furthermore, most therapeutics and diagnostics rely on detecting a single biomarker, drastically
limiting their specificity. Genetic circuits that can robustly and efficiently integrate multiple inputs, logically pro-
cess the information, and produce the desired outputs will be required to address this challenge.
One of the most important tools for genetic circuit engineering in mammalian cells is the site-specific recom-
binase. An advantage of a recombinase-based gene expression circuit is its ability to amplify weak input signals.
Furthermore, our lab and others have shown that recombinases are especially suitable for logic circuit engineer-
ing. We have also identified many split locations within several orthogonal recombinases, which were leveraged
to develop a large collection of small-molecule inducible recombinases with enhanced performance.
While we have a powerful collection of recombinase-based gene circuits, there are significant gaps in our toolkit
that severely limit their applicability. For instance, it remains challenging to connect recombinase to input sen-
sors that display minimal basal activity and sufficient dynamic range, which degrades the performance of recom-
binase-based circuits. Moreover, multi-input recombinase circuits typically require multiple orthogonal recom-
binases. Since recombinase can permanently modify DNA, it has a natural memory capability, which prevents
them from distinguishing sequential (e.g., A then B) vs. simultaneous appearance (A AND B) of inputs. Therefore,
it would be desirable to develop circuits that can integrate various inputs with as few recombinases as possible.
For this proposed work, we will develop digital enhancer circuits and self-assembled split recombinases for com-
binatorial logic sensing to amplify signals and improve specificity. We will demonstrate their applications in the
context of cellular diagnostic devices for ovarian cancer. To achieve our objectives, we will;
Aim 1: Design a recombinase-shRNA-based digital enhancer circuit to amplify input signals
Aim 2: Design a library of self-assembled split recombinases for combinatorial logic circuits
Our team has all the necessary expertise to accomplish this work, as demonstrated by our published work in
engineering recombinase circuits, in vivo tumor diagnostics, and tumor-targeting immune cells in vivo. Success
from this proposed work will lead to a transformative platform for engineering cellular diagnostic devices. Fur-
thermore, our work will also set the foundation for using engineered cells to detect other pathological conditions,
such as inflammation."

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive disease that results in lung scarring and breathing
difficulty with a median survival of 2-5 years following diagnosis. Although the underlying mechanisms are poorly
understood, fibroblastic foci develop around alveoli as dense regions of extracellular matrix (ECM) and activated
fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. These stiff fibrotic lesions are implicated in the pathogenesis of IPF as poorer
outcomes are observed in patients with more fibroblastic foci. Age is a major risk factor in IPF, and aging
pathways, including the senescence-associated secretory pathway (SASP) and development of apoptosis-
resistant fibroblasts, have been implicated in IPF. However, the interplay between ECM mechanosensing and
aging in IPF remains poorly understood, and this lack of understanding limits the development of therapeutic
agents. The objective of this project is to elucidate the contributions of FAK mechanosensing to ECM remodeling,
senescence, apoptosis-resistance, and SASP in pulmonary fibrosis. Our central hypothesis is that aging-
associated dysregulation of FAK mechanosignaling drives pulmonary fibrosis. We will exploit a novel in vitro 3D
bioengineered microtissue model that mimics healthy and diseased lung tissue to dissect FAK mechanosignaling
in senescent fibroblasts and an IPF-relevant aged mouse model to evaluate inhaled microparticles delivering
FAK inhibitors in alleviating pulmonary fibrosis. Aim 1. Engineer microtissues using human primary fibroblasts
isolated from IPF and healthy donors to model senescence and ECM remodeling in pulmonary fibrosis. Aim 2.
Assess the role of FAK in regulating senescent phenotype, apoptosis, SASP, and ECM remodeling in NHLF and
DHLF-IPF microtissues. Aim 3. Evaluate the therapeutic effects of inhaled microparticles delivering FAK inhibitor
in modulating fibroblast senescence and alleviating pulmonary fibrosis in a bleomycin-induced lung injury model
in aged mice. This research will provide new insights into cell-ECM interactions driving disease and identify
therapeutic targets for the treatment of IPF."

Nutrient homeostasis in most living cells is mediated by membrane carrier proteins, which facilitate the
translocation of small molecule metabolites across cellular membranes. Despite their clear roles in physiology
and disease, many of the small molecule carriers in mammals are poorly studied owing to their hydrophobicity.
Indeed, approximately 30% of these carriers still do not have known substrates or physiological functions. Among
small molecule metabolites, choline is a vitamin-like metabolite that is indispensable for cellular and organismal
viability. Choline is a dietary component that is critical for the structural integrity of cell membranes, one carbon
metabolism, signaling, cholinergic neurotransmission, and lipid and cholesterol transport and metabolism. Most
human cells need to import choline from their extracellular environment. Since serum choline concentration is
~10µM in mammals, choline uptake should occur almost exclusively through high affinity plasma membrane
transporters. However, the identity of the high affinity choline transporter ubiquitously expressed across
mammalian tissues remains to be discovered.
To address this, in our preliminary work, we used a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of plasma
metabolites from a cohort of Finnish individuals and linked biochemical pathways to uncharacterized membrane
transporter genes. This analysis identified a ubiquitously expressed plasma membrane transporter, feline
leukemia virus subgroup C cellular receptor 1 (FLVCR1), as a genetic determinant of phosphocholine and
phosphatidylcholine levels in human plasma. Biochemical characterization of cells lacking FLVCR1 revealed
striking defects in choline metabolism. Additionally, FLVCR1 loss impairs proliferation of cells under choline
limitation. Building upon this observation, in this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that FLVCR1 and its close
paralog FLVCR2 are required for choline transport and homeostasis in mammals. To address this, we will first
investigate how loss of FLVCR1-mediated choline import impacts mammalian cell metabolism and physiology.
In the second aim, we propose to enhance our understanding of how FLVCR1 and FLVCR2 facilitate choline
transport using biochemical and structural studies. Specifically, we will determine structures of FLVCR1/2 in a
ligand-free condition to visualize the conformational changes associated with ligand-binding and release and use
mutagenesis to probe the role of residues that directly coordinate choline and those associated with disease.
Finally, we will determine the role of FLVCR1-mediated choline import in tissue physiology. In particular, given
the role of choline in liver metabolism, we will focus on the impact of FLVCR1 loss in liver metabolism and non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)."
10944533,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Toxicities of treating human papilloma virus-related (HPV+) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas
(OPSCCs) with radiation plus cisplatin create lifelong disabilities in survivors of this increasingly common
cancer. Reducing radiation doses and cisplatin use for HPV+ OPSCC is impeded by difficulty distinguishing a
subset of cases with high recurrence risk, and the mechanisms of therapy resistance in such patients are
unclear. These knowledge gaps contribute to both overtreating easily curable patients and ineffective therapy
for high-risk cases. Opportunity to overcome these barriers arose from our finding that the HPV+ OPSCCs
predisposed to recurrence upregulate a master driver of mitochondrial biogenesis, the PGC-1/ERR gene
regulatory axis. These tumors have potential to exploit the antioxidant systems fueled by mitochondria to
neutralize oxidative stress induced by hypoxia, nutrient depletion, metastatic spread, and current therapies.
HPV+ OPSCCs with high mitochondrial mass expressed less HPV E6 oncoprotein and more p53, its canonical
target for degradation. Because increasing E6 repressed mitochondrial biogenesis and sensitized to cisplatin
and radiation, certain tumors may find selective advantage in partly downregulating E6 while upregulating other
oncogenic drivers. Interventions to target such drivers and phenocopy the subset of E6’s activities that induce
oxidative stress offer new avenues for overcoming therapy resistance. Thus, our overall hypothesis is that p53-
induced activation of the PGC-1/ERR axis in presence of reduced E6 expression leads to poor survival for
certain HPV+ OPSCCs but also creates targetable vulnerabilities in them. Aim 1 will elucidate the interactions
among HPV E6 levels, mitochondrial mass and function, and HPV+ OPSCC progression. For this purpose, we
will dissect the contribution of E6 levels to the range of mitochondrial mass and antioxidant capacity seen
across different tumors and malignant cells in individual tumors. Altering mitochondrial mass by varying E6
levels will be tested for impact on growth, invasion, and metastasis. E6’s effects on mitochondrial function and
tumor progression will then be assessed for dependence on p53 and PGC-1α individually and combination,
and p53’s role in regulating PGC-1 expression and function will be determined in this context. Aim 2 will
define strategies to sensitize HPV+ OPSCCs with high mitochondrial mass. Effects of E6 and mitochondrial
mass on responses to radiation and cisplatin individually and in combination will be characterized in detail. The
chromatin regulatory enzymes Set7 and PRMT1, which enhance PGC-1 function and are inhibited by E6, will
then be tested for mechanistic roles in treatment resistance and for therapeutic utility in low-E6 tumors.
Similarly, ERR‘s mechanistic role in this context will be defined, and its utility as a target for sensitizing to
therapy will be tested. Testing our working model via these aims will enable prospective identification of
therapy-resistant cases and define molecular targets to treat them. This effort will also allow creation of precise
biomarkers and less toxic agents for treatment-sensitive cases, where current therapies leave lasting disability."
10952448,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The dynamics of typical visual input challenge the brain: movement of objects or caused by navigation shifts
visual information over the retina, and complicates the brain’s goal of understanding visual input as an
organized collection of objects. Visual scene segmentation occurs in the ventral - ‘what’ - stream in the primate
brain, hence prior studies have studied these circuits mostly under static conditions, since motion is thought to
be mainly processed elsewhere, in the dorsal – ‘where’ – stream. These prior studies found that the earliest
surface segmentation signal in the primate brain is selectivity for border ownership. Border ownership neurons
respond differently to an identical border in their receptive field depending on which side of the border is owned
by foreground. It is poorly understood how these circuits contribute to the processing of the dynamic, complex
visual scenes in everyday environments. Recently the applicants found that border ownership units with similar
properties as those in the brain emerge in an artificial neural network trained to predict the next frame in
natural videos, even though the network was not trained to segment objects. This indicates that these units aid
in predicting future input. The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand how border ownership units
contribute to this objective. Specific aims are to understand 1) the stimulus diet that drives the emergence of
border ownership units in artificial neural networks (Aim 1); and 2) how these units benefit the prediction of
future input in natural videos (Aim 2). To this end the applicants will perform experiments in artificial neural
networks (in silico) as well as in the non-human primate brain. This exploratory research may thus lead to a
paradigm shift in the understanding of scene segmentation circuits, which traditionally have been assumed to
perform a function typically considered under static conditions: segmenting objects from background. This
research addresses several research needs recognized by the National Eye Institute, including exploring the
connections between biological measurements and theoretical models of vision processes, and understanding
processing in higher brain areas to inform the design of next-generation cortex prostheses. Moreover, it may
lead to better diagnostic and therapeutic tools for disorders characterized by disrupted perception of complex
visual input, such as visual agnosias and schizophrenia. This project is a collaboration between Dr. Franken
(PI), an electrophysiologist with expertise in border ownership circuits in the primate brain, and Dr. Wessel (co-
I), a neurophysicist with expertise in studying visual processing (including natural videos) in a variety of
systems, including in artificial neural networks. The experiments will break new ground and extend previous
work in a new and promising direction. Our ultimate goal is to understand why neural signals that always had
been assumed to segment objects emerge in networks that have a fundamentally different objective –
predicting future input. Thus this research is high-risk high-reward. For these reasons, the proposal is closely
aligned with the purposes of the R21 funding mechanism."
10953301,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The objective of this proposal is to illuminate the fundamental mechanisms by which ubiquitin ligases
recognize and ubiquitinate substrates within protein complexes. Our interest in this topic arose after our
discovery that the multifunctional ubiquitin ligase Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC) is mutated in inherited
neurodevelopmental disorders. Studies from the Ferguson and Brown labs in APC mutant in vivo and in vitro
systems demonstrated a previously unknown role for APC-mediated ubiquitin signaling in the regulation of the
composition of neuronal heterochromatin through clearance of specific protein substrates. In post-mitotic
neurons of the developing APC mutant brain, we found that the most significantly dysregulated target of the APC
in neurons was the Chromosome-Passenger Complex (CPC), which includes the kinase Aurora B and the
scaffold INCENP. Imaging analysis showed that Aurora B and its product phosphorylated Histone 3 (p-H3,
H3S10ph) accumulate within heterochromatin in APC mutant neurons during post-mitotic terminal differentiation.
Through the proposed aims, we will examine the interaction between the APC, its target the CPC, and the CPC
product H3S10ph, to generate critical structural insight into the molecular pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental
disorders. In Aim 1, we will build upon past successes in similar experiments by producing the CPC and the APC
as purified recombinant protein complexes and dissect their interaction using in vitro enzyme assays and mass
spectrometry. In Aim 2, we will perform cryo-EM to produce a structural map of the APC interacting with the
CPC. We predict that the completion of these aims will shed light on the molecular interactions required for the
recognition and ubiquitination of the CPC by the APC, providing key mechanistic insight into chromatin regulation
by ubiquitin signaling and the pathogenesis of APC-related neurodevelopmental disorders. Through the
proposed combination of hypothesis-driven and unbiased experiments, we will build upon our discovery of the
neurodevelopmentally essential APC-CPC-H3S10ph axis. Insight gained from these aims will likely serve as the
foundation for us to expand in a multitude of long-term experimental directions in vivo and in vitro. The molecular
understanding gained from these lines of inquiry would provide critical insight that will be necessary for the
development of rational interventions for a class of debilitating diseases that represents a major unmet medical
need."
10953359,"ABSTRACT
Accurate estimates of adult death rates are critical to good science and health policy. In most
high-income countries, adult death rates are directly calculated since civil registration systems
record every death. But in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)--including most of Asia
and Africa–civil registration systems are weak. Estimates from high quality surveys could be a
promising source of information about adult mortality in these countries, but unfortunately,
decades of research have revealed that estimating adult death rates from a survey is extremely
challenging. A major obstacle is that current methods require many thousands of interviews per
survey. Large surveys are prohibitively expensive, and they make it difficult to innovate and
improve methods over time. As a result, there is a critical lack of evidence about adult mortality
in LMICs. This is a problem: without accurate adult death rates, researchers cannot evaluate the
impact of policies intended to confront deadly pandemics such as AIDS and COVID-19, quantify
the pace of population aging, produce population projections that inform social and economic
policy, or even directly measure life expectancy. This project will develop a new set of statistical
and data collection tools make it possible to collect information about adult mortality using
surveys with moderate sample sizes (n ≈ 1,000-2,000), thereby greatly expanding the potential
sources of data available to understand adult mortality in LMICs. Aim 1 will develop new
statistical methods, and apply them to already-collected pilot data; estimated death rates will be
compared to a gold standard, allowing for errors and accuracy to be calculated for each method.
Aim 2 will collect new qualitative data to help explain why the best-performing methods were
successful in this setting (as revealed by Aim 1); and help generate hypotheses that will form
the basis for a larger-scale, multi-site test of these methods in the future. The findings will form
the basis of a new website and support other tools for disseminating our results. The results will
produce tools that can be used to increase the amount of evidence available about adult death
rates around the world."

and (4) to provide sufficient quantities of standardized Immulina™ working closely with other researchers from 
the UM BDSRC and collaborating with other units of CARBON on future efficacy studies of ImmulinaTM."
10946269,"While it is generally agreed that epithelial injury is a central process in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF),
differential mechanisms that determine functional repair versus dysfunctional repair are incompletely
understood. Emerging data indicate that airway-derived progenitors can give rise to a variety of “transitional”
and proximal-like cell states that are retained in the lung parenchyma in humans with IPF, thereby suggesting
that these aberrant epithelial cell states contribute to dysfunctional repair following repetitive injury. This
proposal is focused on elucidating the mediators and pathways that contribute to dysfunctional epithelial
phenotypes that emerge in persistent lung fibrosis. In preliminary data, we compared the traditional single dose
intratracheal (IT) bleomycin (bleo) model, which causes acute injury to the lung epithelium followed by patchy,
transient fibrosis, with a multi-dose, repetitive IT bleo model, which results in persistent lung fibrosis and
“metaplastic” epithelial remodeling. By single cell RNA-sequencing, we found that repetitive IT bleo induces
several aberrant epithelial cell states that are not observed after single-dose IT bleo and share transcriptional
homology with transitional cell states observed in human IPF. Using cell fate mapping strategies, we showed
that these aberrant transitional cell states arise primarily from airway progenitors. By evaluating pathways that
were differentially activated in epithelial cells after repetitive IT bleo, we found up-regulation of Hypoxia-
inducible factor (HIF) signaling. Epithelial-specific deletion of HIF1/2 dramatically reduced fibrosis and
metaplastic-appearing epithelial remodeling in the repetitive IT bleo model. Further, treatment with a specific
HIF2 inhibitor restored epithelial structure towards normal and enhanced generation of airway progenitor-
derived AT2 and AT1 cells after repetitive injury. Consistent with these data, HIF2 inhibition in mouse, as well
as human, alveolar organoids promoted alveolar epithelial cell fate of airway-derived progenitors. Based on
these preliminary data, we hypothesize that persistent fibrosis occurs in the lungs when repair capacity of AT2
progenitor cells is exceeded and airway precursors are unable to functionally regenerate a normal alveolar
epithelial barrier. HIF2 activation alters the differentiation potential of airway progenitor cells, resulting in
“proximal-like” cell fates that impair alveolar recovery and potentiate local profibrotic signaling. Specific Aims
will: 1) identify factors that drive dysfunctional epithelial states present in persistent lung fibrosis, 2) determine
the impact of HIF signaling in preventing functional alveolar repair after repetitive injury, and 3) investigate the
niche-specific mechanisms that regulate persistent lung fibrosis. Together these novel studies will identify the
origins and functions of airway-derived epithelial cell states that are directly related to the metaplastic epithelial
phenotypes observed in human IPF. This work will facilitate development of therapeutic strategies to enhance
functional alveolar repair and improve outcomes in IPF."

Obesity poses a major health risk, contributing to elevated morbidity and mortality from cancer, cardiovascular
disease, and diabetes. Children living in rural areas have higher rates of obesity than their urban counterparts.
Based upon our extensive prior work, we propose a multilevel factorial design randomized controlled trial with
interventions at the clinic and individual patient level to treat pediatric obesity among underserved rural children
and families. The individual intervention is an mHealth rurally tailored pediatric obesity behavioral intervention
(iAmHealthy) vs. Newsletter control while the clinic level intervention is a cluster randomized stepped wedge
(Healthy Clinic intervention) designed to improve clinics’ treatment of children with overweight and obesity. The
iAmHealthy intervention is a rurally tailored empirically supported family-based behavioral group program
targeting the families of children who are overweight or obese and providing 26 contact hours of group and
individual intervention. The Healthy Clinic intervention is designed to improve provider office processes using a
bundled intervention of provider prompts, skills training and intervention tools implemented with performance
feedback targeted at the implementation of the American Academy of Pediatrics 2023 Clinical Practice Guideline.
This study will be the first to assess both clinic level and patient level pediatric obesity interventions tailored to
the unique barriers in rural pediatric populations. Four states (AR, KS, NE, SC), who are members of the ECHO
IDeA State Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN) and participated in a previous feasibility study of the
iAmHealthy intervention (NCT04142034) in rural medical clinics have each recruited four medical clinics who
care for rural children. In each rural clinic, investigators will recruit 32 caregiver/child dyads who will be randomly
assigned to iAmHealthy (n=16) or Newsletter (n=16), for a total of 512 child/caregiver dyads. Aim 1 assesses
the effectiveness of the iAmHealthy intervention vs Newsletter control with an outcome of a healthier BMI for
children. Aim 2 assesses the effectiveness of the Healthy Clinic intervention with the outcome of identification
and treatment of children with overweight and obesity. In Aim 3 we compare the effectiveness of the combination
of the iAmHealthy intervention and the Healthy Clinic intervention to each individual intervention and to no
intervention. The current proposal studies two easily disseminable multilevel interventions and their combination
to address modifiable risk factors for cancer in rural populations, specifically pediatric obesity. These findings
could significantly change the way medical clinics care for the 41% of rural children who are overweight or obese."

In the United States, millions of individuals with diabetes suffer from diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) that negatively
impact physical function, reduce quality of life, increase the risk of amputation, and drive up healthcare utilization
and costs. These ulcers frequently recur after healing, making it imperative to prevent their recurrence to avoid
adverse limb outcomes, major amputation, and death. Although offloading foot pressure is vital for DFU healing
and prevention, many patients find it difficult to adhere to offloading treatment recommendations following
healing. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a lifestyle-focused occupational therapy (OT) intervention
to help patients develop self-care routines and habits that support consistent offloading and foot care. The pilot
randomized controlled trial will enroll 60 participants with healed DFUs and randomly assign them to either the
OT intervention group or a control group. This mixed-methods study has three aims over two years. Aim 1 is to
determine if the OT intervention is feasible for patients at risk of DFU recurrence; Aim 2 is to assess patient and
provider satisfaction with the OT intervention and the role that occupational therapists play in diabetic limb care
using surveys, interviews, and focus groups; and Aim 3 is to compare DFU recurrence rates and changes in
diabetes distress and quality of life between the two groups in pre- and post-evaluation. The lifestyle-focused
OT intervention is expected to be feasible and acceptable to patients and providers in DFU prevention. It may
improve adherence to offloading treatment and patient-reported outcomes. This study will provide preliminary
data on this patient-centered approach to prevent DFU recurrence and improve care for this high-risk population.
The results of this feasibility study will support an R01 submission that will rigorously evaluate the cost-
effectiveness of the OT intervention through a large randomized clinical trial. The ultimate goal of this R03
proposal is to enhance the ability of the PI (Dr. Tan) to transition to an independent investigator by providing pilot
data to help support a subsequent R01 proposal."

10953958,"ABSTRACT:
Infections caused by double stranded DNA viruses are a common complication after allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), occurring in 82% of patients undergoing
transplant at our institution. These infections are a significant source of both morbidity and
mortality in the post-HSCT setting. Commercially available anti-viral medications have
inadequate response rates, prolong hospitalizations, and have narrow therapeutic indexes with
high toxicity rates. Additionally, there are no effective anti-viral medications for two of the more
common viruses, BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) and adenovirus. An alternative approach for viral
management is the use of virus-specific T-cells (VST); this cellular therapy approach uses
peripheral blood from healthy donors to generate highly expanded and viral directed T-cell
populations given as a simple intravenous infusion. This therapy has shown itself across
multiple clinical trials to be safe and highly effective for the treatment of viremia and invasive
viral disease caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), BKPyV, and
adenovirus. The generalizability of this therapy has increased through use of partially-HLA
matched, ‘off-the-shelf’ third-party VSTs where a product from a VST bank is chosen for a
patient based off of anti-viral activity of the product and the degree of human leukocyte antigen
(HLA) matching. However, while response rates are excellent (on the order of 70-90%
depending on the virus), treatment failures occur even when a good and rationally chosen
product is given.
In this proposal we aim to improve understanding of the mechanisms underlying treatment
success and failure following VST infusion. We hypothesize that both patient- and virus- specific
factors facilitate the effective response to third-party VSTs and that treatment non-response is
due to definable and non-mutually exclusive defects in one or both of these areas. We will use
pre- and post-infusion samples collected from patients enrolled on an active third-party VST
treatment study to complete these aims. From a recipient perspective, we believe that failure of
VST persistence, inadequate antigen presentation, and failure of initial T-cell expansion can be
detected in patients with poor response. From a viral perspective, we will use epitope mapping
and NGS sequencing of viral genome to explore the role of both non-conservation of antigenic
epitopes and antigen escape. We believe that these experiments will generate generalizable
data on mechanisms behind VST treatment with potential implications for improving the therapy
moving forward."
10954466,"An innovative device for management of neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury Neuropathic pain (NP) after spinal cord injury (SCI) is common and debilitating, and has increasingly been recognized as an important contributor to suffering, poor rehabilitation outcomes and reduced quality of life. Different non-invasive neurodomulatory techniques via peripheral (TENS) or central (tDCS) electrical stimulation have been used. However, their effectiveness is still limited and controversial. We have recently developed a novel, non- invasive, non-pharmacological intervention – Breathing-controlled electrical stimulation (BreEStim) for neuropathic pain management. Our preliminary work has shown that that BreEStim could produce effective analgesic effects in SCI+NP patients via central neuromodulation mechanisms. Though clinically effective, the BreEStim apparatus is currently a customized apparatus for laboratory use only. A stand-alone BreEStim device is needed for routine clinical use. The planned BreEStim device will be developed by our industry partner, Soterix Medical Inc (SMI). The device will then be tested in a single-center randomized controlled clinical trial at our research center. Accordingly, we would like to pursue the following specific aims. UG3 Specific Aim 1: Develop an integrated BreEStim device under FDA Quality Systems UH3 Specific Aim 2: Examine efficacy and safety of BreEStim in a single-center  randomized controlled clinical trial UH3 Specific Aim 3: Iterate device hardware, obtain IEC certification, and advance  regulatory process. At the completion of this project, pending promising clinical outcome, the results will establish that the developed BreEStim device is safe and effective. We will accordingly engage the FDA on the evidence needed to support the intended use. If a larger multicenter trial is necessary for marketing clearance, we will engage the FDA about trial design and pathway for approval.

10945252,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated, demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS)
and a leading cause of disability in young adults. MS white matter lesions are easily visible on clinical magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) and are the target of current treatments. However, white matter lesions are poor
predictors of disability, and prevention of white matter lesion formation does not stop gradual disability worsening
in later stages of disease, when white matter lesion formation is rare. Cortical lesions are also common in MS,
can be extensive, and are associated with disability and disability worsening over time. Cortical lesions are
thought to form due to overlying meningeal inflammation and thus they may respond differently to treatment than
white matter lesions, in which inflammatory mediators come from parenchymal veins. Here we propose to further
our understanding of MS cortical lesion formation and repair in early MS, the immunological mechanisms
underlying these processes, and the impact of these processes on the clinical course of disease.
New MRI methods applied at ultra-high field strength (7 tesla, T), some of which we helped to develop, now allow
us to sensitively visualize cortical lesions in vivo and track their formation and repair. With these methods, we
and others have demonstrated that cortical lesions are common, even early in disease, and are associated with
disability. We have also found that cortical lesion burden, but not white matter lesion burden, predicts subsequent
worsening of motor disability. Our recent data demonstrate that cortical lesion formation is rare in longstanding
disease, and so we hypothesize that cortical lesions form early in disease and then lead to subsequent gradual
worsening of disability over time. Here, we propose to follow a cohort of adults with newly diagnosed MS for 3
years with 7T MRI (including 0.5mm3 T1 and motion and B0-corrected T2* weighted imaging), motor and cognitive
evaluation, and blood collection at baseline, year 1, and year 3. A subset of participants will also undergo
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection at baseline. We will determine how cortical and white matter demyelination
are related in early MS and their relative contributions to physical and cognitive disability and disability worsening
over time (Aim 1). Using annual MRI data as well as data from short interval MRI follow-up (baseline, month 3,
month 6) in a subset of participants, we will measure changes in cortical lesions over time and characterize
cortical lesion growth, repair, and chronic inflammation (Aim 2). Finally, we will use single cell transcriptomics,
proteomics, and flow cytometry in blood and CSF to determine how cortical lesion burden is related to immune
activation in the periphery and the CNS (Aim 3).
This work will lead to key advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology, natural history, and clinical
implications of cortical lesions in early MS, which will be essential the future development and testing of
treatments targeting cortical lesion formation and repair."

which undergoes an especially complicated series of co- and post-translational proteolytic processing steps to
generate multiple membrane-anchored, membrane-associated, and secreted glycoproteins. The overarching
goal of this highly interwoven collaborative project is to address the critical gaps in our understanding of the
architecture and assembly of the membrane-bound, virion-incorporated, and secreted glycoprotein
components and complexes, and their functions in virion assembly, entry, host cell subversion, and disease.
The collaborative team is anchored by K. Chandran (Einstein; BSL-2 virus models, genetic approaches,
mechanistic virology, antibody discovery), J. McLellan (UT-Austin; structural virology, protein engineering), E.
Harris (UC-Berkeley; virus-host interactions underlying pathogenesis, viral toxins), and A. Herbert and S.
Monticelli (USAMRIID/The Geneva Foundation; mechanisms of infection and pathogenesis by authentic viruses
at BSL-4). We also leverage the unique expertise of S. Sidoli (Einstein; mass spectrometry). Rigorous
preliminary research by our interdisciplinary team has uncovered evidence that GP38 is both an integral
component of the CCHFV entry glycoprotein complex and a secreted `toxin' that can subvert host
endothelial barriers to cause vascular leak and/or facilitate viral dissemination. Building on these and other
findings, we will determine high-resolution structures of CCHFV glycoprotein complexes and discover novel
human monoclonal antibodies (Aim 1); elucidate mechanisms of CCHFV assembly, entry, and antibody action
(Aim 2); and uncover entry-independent mechanisms of viral pathogenesis mediated by CCHFV GP38 and
investigate the mechanisms by which anti-GP38 antibodies protect against CCHV infection and disease (Aim 3).
We expect to deliver analyses of the structure, assembly, and functions of the `Swiss army knife' that is the
CCHFV glycoprotein complex at an unprecedented level of molecular detail and identify viral Achilles' heels for
the development of urgently needed CCHFV medical countermeasures."

Osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) has been used clinically to improve the quality of life for several 
medical conditions and injuries; however, limited data is available on the brain’s response to this innovative 
treatment. Cranial OMM (cOMM) involves the gentle application of manual force to the head and the axial spine, 
subsequently affecting the patient by releasing soft tissue restrictions. This technique enhances motion of the 
tissues and fluid flow through the brain through natural channels and helps to regulate tissue fluid flows in the 
body as well as balancing the autonomic nervous system. We expect that cOMM will help to clear inflammatory 
molecules from the brain in clinical challenges such as traumatic brain injury (TBI). To elucidate the mechanistic 
effects of this integrative health approach utilizing cOMM, studies will focus on the cholinergic system. Multiple 
studies and preliminary data consistently demonstrate that significant dysregulation in cholinergic 
neurotransmission mechanisms occurs in injured rodent brains, which is intricately linked to neurological 
phenotypes such as cognitive impairment and other neurologic dysfunctions. This underscores the profound 
importance of exploring the therapeutic potential of cOMM in mitigating these adverse effects. There is a critical 
need to ascertain the interactions of physiological (e.g., neural, musculoskeletal, immune) and psychological 
systems in response to force-based interventions such as cOMM. Using TBI as a platform, the broad, long-term 
objective of this study is to evaluate the neuro-biological effect of cOMM as a non-invasive approach to alleviate 
symptoms and enhance neural tissue recovery. Using a preclinical model, we will investigate if cOMM can 
mitigate behavioral patterns seen following repetitive closed head brain injury. We will use biomedical MR 
imaging and molecular biology techniques to measure brain fluid flow and track inflammation with and without 
cOMM treatment. Our study will include both males and females because it has been shown that neurological 
symptoms, severity of injury and hence possibly changes in fluid flow in the brain are different between sexes, 
which will allow refinement of cOMM treatment depending on sex. Collectively, we will be the first to provide 
evidence for the clinically observed effects following cOMM when used as an intervention for TBI and resulting 
acute and chronic symptoms."

The actin cytoskeleton impacts virtually every function of a human cell. Sophisticated regulatory mechanisms
ensure that actin polymerizes when and where it is needed, and the assembly of actin filaments de novo is
driven by proteins called nucleation factors. While the cytoskeleton is known to provide structure and generate
forces in cellular processes that maintain viability, how it affects programmed cell death in response to stress is
not well understood. To address this question, we are investigating the mechanisms by which actin nucleation
factors from the mammalian Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP) family control apoptosis following DNA
damage. Our recent studies demonstrate that the WASP-family members JMY and WHAMM activate the
Arp2/3 complex to assemble a juxtanuclear F-actin-rich territory that regulates apoptotic signaling. The
cytoskeletal territory (I) serves as a compartment for coupling the biogenesis of apoptosomes to the localized
processing of caspases, and (II) sequesters the active caspases to temporarily protect the rest of the cell from
proteolytic cleavage. However, the molecular interactions between the apoptotic components and cytoskeletal
factors are not known. The specific goals of this project are to (1) define how apoptosome proteins and the
actin nucleation machinery interact in early apoptosis, and (2) determine how caspases disrupt F-actin-rich
territories to execute terminal apoptosis. To accomplish the first goal, we will (a) deplete the core apoptosome
components cytochrome c and/or Apaf-1 and define the localization patterns of JMY, WHAMM, and their
functional domains in fixed and live apoptotic cells; (b) characterize the physical interactions between
apoptosomal proteins and actin nucleation factors in vitro; (c) systematically quantify the abilities of purified
JMY, WHAMM, and Arp2/3 complex to polymerize actin in isolation, in the presence of each other, and in a
cytochrome c-regulated manner in vitro; and (d) measure the effects of precise JMY and WHAMM mutants on
actin assembly, apoptosome organization, and caspase activation in cells. To accomplish the second goal, we
will (a) deplete or mutate several caspases to identify the ones needed for dismantling F-actin-rich territories in
cells; (b) determine if caspases can cleave F-actin, G-actin, and actin-binding proteins in vitro; (c) define the
roles of actin crosslinking, bundling, capping, severing, and depolymerizing proteins on territory stability and
localization of a caspase inhibitor in cells; and (d) ascertain whether disease-associated actin mutants are
resistant to caspase cleavage and affect terminal apoptotic signaling in cells. Collectively, our results will
provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of communication between key components of the
intrinsic apoptotic signaling cascade and the actin cytoskeleton."

Despite 100 years and countless scientific advances since the devastating flu pandemic
of 1918, viral respiratory illnesses remain a great pandemic threat. The current COVID-
19 outbreak has only emphasized our inability to deal with these deadly viruses. A major
shortcoming in treatment is the inability to reduce the massive and life-threatening
pulmonary inflammation and injury caused by infection. As we work to develop
therapeutic approaches, our lab has turned to the one population that is consistently
protected from severe viral pneumonias: children. We postulate that by identifying the
mechanisms behind this youthful privilege, we can develop novel therapies to reduce the
deadly pneumonia that occurs during severe fatal infection. While just as likely to become
infected during viral pandemics, children (ages 4-18) do not typically undergo the severe
pulmonary inflammation or mortality that can occur in adults. We are able to recapitulate
this protection in prepubescent mice (p23-27) during fatal pandemic flu infection. Our
preliminary data show that young mice are less susceptible to mortality and do not
undergo the severe pneumonia that is common during severe infection. Moreover, we
have discovered that prepubescent mice have sustained output of newly produced CD4+
recent thymic emigrants (RTEs) which migrate to the lung during infection. It has been
commonly thought that these cells are unimportant during infection as they are
phenotypically “immature”, yet our preliminary data show that thymectomy and removal
of RTEs prior to infection leads to exuberant pulmonary inflammation and increased
mortality. Further, tracheal instillation of CD4+RTEs during infection reduces pulmonary
inflammation, suggesting these cells have ant-inflammatory properties. Taken together,
these data lead us to our central hypothesis that sustained output of anti-inflammatory
CD4+ RTEs reduces influenza induced pulmonary inflammation. The overall objectives
of this exploratory R21 application is to, for the first time, demonstrate the importance of
CD4 RTEs in an infectious inflammatory setting and to identify how they reduce
inflammation. The rationale for this proposed work is that it will allow for the identification
of potential cellular and immune therapies that can be used to reduce life threatening
inflammation."
10953206,"PROJECT SUMMARY Genome instability is the underlying cause of many diseases including premature
aging, neurodegeneration, cancer, and immunodeficiency. Genome integrity is maintained by at least six major
DNA repair pathways, each of which specializes in the repair of distinct types of DNA damage or replication
errors. Inefficient DNA repair in any of these pathways can lead to the accumulation of DNA damage,
mutations, and disease. Thus, to study the mechanisms by which DNA repair protects against disease, we
need to know the status of all DNA repair pathways in human cells. Mutational signatures provide valuable
insights into DNA repair, but they have several important limitations. Mutational signatures may not reflect the
current status of DNA repair, and the bulk sequencing most commonly used to measure mutational signatures
can miss important cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Furthermore, the relationship to the functional status of DNA
repair remains poorly understood for many mutational signatures. Direct measurements of DNA repair would
overcome these obstacles, but technology capable of the necessary large-scale functional analyses of DNA
repair have not been available. We will address this long unmet need by developing high-throughput functional
assays and an advanced analytical framework for single-cell resolution measurements of all major DNA repair
pathways. Our strategy is based on our well-established and widely applied fluorescence multiplex host cell
reactivation (FM-HCR) assays, which report the ability of cells to repair site-specific DNA lesions incorporated
into fluorescent reporter plasmids. Using a sequencing approach (HCR-Seq) that is firmly established in our
preliminary data, we will generate a library of reporter plasmids that can signal DNA repair capacity by a
change in the abundance or sequence of a reporter transcript, instead of a fluorescent signal. Following
transient transfection of 500 cell lines (transfected in 20 pools of approximately 25 cell lines each), reporter
transcripts and host cell transcriptomes will be analyzed by single-cell RNAseq. The resulting dataset will
generate an unprecedented resource: comprehensive multi-pathway DNA repair analyses with single-cell
resolution in 500 highly characterized cell lines that are part of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. This dataset
will be integrated with existing sequencing and proteomics data to identify relationships of DNA repair capacity
with mutational signatures, genomic and epigenomic somatic alterations, and gene and drug dependencies.
The dataset will also provide an unprecedented view of cell-to-cell heterogeneity with respect to DNA repair
that can be interpreted in the context of host cell transcriptomes, as we have shown for cell cycle-dependent
regulation of DNA repair. Our dataset and approach will be shared with the scientific community in the Broad
DepMap Portal to advance future projects aimed at understanding the biological mechanisms underlying
genome instability and the potential for translational work aimed at predicting and preventing its consequences
for human health."
10952496,"Musculoskeletal (MSK) pain is a major burden on the US population, representing the leading cause of disability
and non-cancer reason for opioids prescriptions, as well as the top health care spending category in the country.
Physical therapy (PT) has been shown to be effective in reducing pain and disability among patients with MSK
pain. PT has also been shown to help reduce health care spending related to MSK pain by reducing the utilization
of major cost drivers, such as imaging and surgery. However, the effects of PT are closely tied to patients’
engagement with PT care, especially how often they complete prescribed home exercises. Unfortunately, these
rates are often low, which means patients are not experiencing the full benefit of PT and are likely going on to
receive more invasive procedures or use opioids following a “non-response” to PT. In 2021, new procedural
codes were announced by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that facilitate the use of Remote
Therapeutic Monitoring (RTM) by physical therapists. RTM is a point of care mobile health (mHealth) solution
that includes the integration of a mobile application into the PT episode of care. Through the use of a digital RTM
platform, RTM allows physical therapists to assign exercises to patients in a mobile application, track their
adherence to home exercise programs, and to track patient progress through the use of patient-reported surveys
administered through the mobile application. While RTM stands to improve patients’ experiences with PT and
the effectiveness of PT, little to no research has been conducted on the effectiveness of RTM-enhanced PT nor
has research been conducted examining the feasibility of implementing RTM in health care systems. As such,
there is an urgent need for research examining the use of RTM among patients with MSK pain. To address this
gap, we propose a phased project (R21/R33) that will examine the feasibility, effectiveness, and implementation
of RTM at a large US academic health care system. During the R21 phase of the project, we will examine the
feasibility of implementing RTM among a pilot group of physical therapists that provide care for patients with
MSK pain (R21 Aim 1). We will also elicit feedback from these physical therapists and their patients receiving
RTM to refine our approach to delivering RTM (R21 Aim 2). Informed by our experiences during the R21 project
phase, the R33 project phase will include full-scale implementation of RTM among all MSK physical therapists
at our institution. During this project phase we will utilize routinely collected patient-reported data (i.e., PROMIS)
to examine the clinical effectiveness of RTM-enhanced PT compared to standard PT (R33 Aim 1), the influence
of RTM-enhanced PT on cost and downstream health care utilization (e.g., imaging, opioids) (R33 Aim 2), and
key implementation outcomes based on the RE-AIM framework. This study will represent one of the first studies
of RTM-enhanced PT and is likely to have major implications for the use of RTM services in the US. Our team
plans to leverage the experience and data we obtain during this project to inform the development of a multi-
center clinical trial examining the clinical and cost-effectiveness of RTM outside of our institution."

We and others have shown that basal tumors, which comprise <20% of PDAC tumors, are resistant to the first-
line chemotherapy regimen FOLFIRINOX. We show that basal tumors are significantly enriched in receptor
tyrosine kinases, including EGFR. While EGFR inhibitors have been consistently disappointing in PDAC, our
analysis of two clinical trials where patients were treated with gemcitabine in combination with an EGFR
inhibitor, shows that the negative results are very likely driven by the previous lack of knowledge of subtypes.
In both clinical trials, patients with basal tumors significantly benefit from EGFR inhibitor treatment. It is
noteworthy that the survival of patients with basal subtype tumors is significantly worse than patients with
classical tumors. We show that, for the very first time, basal patients who receive anti-EGFR therapy benefit
from EGFR inhibitor therapy (patients with classical subtype tumors do not), and can achieve equivalent
outcome to classical patients. Our findings strongly support that the positive subgroup analysis of basal
patients is explained by the higher EGFR kinase expression found in basal tumors. These data strongly
support our hypothesis that targeting subtype-specific kinases will be key to promising precision oncology
approaches for kinase inhibitors in PDAC. We propose a multi-disciplinary team of a translational researcher
(Yeh), kinome expert (Johnson), and medical oncologist (Somasundaram), that takes the next step in
determining if EGFR inhibitors should be repurposed for patients with basal subtype tumors, and leverages a
transformative high sensitivity method of defining the kinome in low input samples such as biopsies, to identify
targeted approaches specifically for basal subtype tumors."

Down syndrome (DS) is a complex genetic disorder with significant physical, cognitive, and behavioral
manifestations. Individuals with DS are also more likely to develop certain health conditions including those
related to dysfunctional metabolism, such as obesity and diabetes. Further, converging lines of evidence suggest
that cellular metabolism is a critical regulator of neurodevelopment, and that metabolites play key roles in
regulating neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation fate specification required for proper brain development.
Despite this, studies have largely overlooked the influence of cellular metabolism on the neurodevelopmental
deficits that contribute to DS pathophysiology. This study aims to comprehensively investigate the intricate
nuclear-metabolic interplay in DS. Our multifaceted approach utilizing human stem cell and mouse models will
decode the molecular, cellular, and tissue level role of cellular metabolism on the brain etiologies observed in
DS. We aim to characterize and modulate the nuclear-metabolic axis at three levels during neurodevelopment:
1) glycolysis, 2) lipid/cholesterol metabolism, and 3) histone acetylation. Findings from this study will provide
critical insights into the mechanisms underlying aberrant brain development in DS and will uncover promising
therapeutic strategies to ameliorate the impact of dysfunctional neurogenesis. Further, our work will shed light
on the broader understanding of the nuclear-metabolic interplay during fate specification, differentiation,
proliferation and brain morphogenesis. Ultimately, this research will provide the blueprint for exploring the role
of the nuclear-metabolic axis broadly in neurodevelopmental disorders, beyond DS, and provide unexplored
therapeutic avenues to improve the lives of individuals living with this disorder."

This submission is in response to PAS-23-086, Small R01s for Clinical Trials Targeting Diseases within the
Mission of NIDDK.
 Hypothyroidism is a common condition associated with excess of cardiovascular risk and poor quality of
life which are not completely abrogated by treatment with levothyroxine (synthetic T4, LT4), potentially
because of the inability to compensate for the loss of T3 secreted by the thyroid gland. Experimental data in
animal models indicate that only combination LT4 and liothyronine (synthetic T3, LT3) can restore normal
concentrations of thyroid hormones across the tissues target of the hormonal action. Clinical trials based on
LT4/LT3 combination therapy and desiccated thyroid extracts (containing T3) have provided conflicting data,
but the plurality of the results indicates a preference toward T3-containing therapies when compared to LT4
alone. Conversely, the short half-life of T3 poses concern of cardiovascular toxicity due to fluctuating levels of
T3, particularly when LT3 is prescribed in single dose. No study has systematically assessed the optimal dose
and frequency of LT3 administration in LT4/LT3 combination therapy. There is an unmet need to define a safe,
effective, and feasible regimen to be applied in large trials aimed at assessing LT4/LT3 therapy efficacy and
safety.
 We have conducted clinical studies aimed at characterizing the pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics of LT3 and, more recently, we completed a R21-sponsored LT4/LT3 combination therapy
clinical trial in patients undergoing total thyroidectomy. The data suggest that LT4/LT3 combination therapy is
effective in normalizing thyroid hormone levels and in preventing the rise in serum cholesterol and weight when
compared to LT4 alone. Moreover, our results from a prior study appear to negate a clinical role of rapid T3
action, supporting the use of LT3 in single administration. These original findings serve as foundation for the
current proposal.
 Hypothesis: A once daily administration of LT4/LT3 combination therapy will be (i) effective yet safe,
(ii) comparable to a twice daily LT4/LT3 administration regimen, and (iii) superior to LT4 therapy in improving
clinically relevant indices of thyroid hormone action.
 To test this hypothesis, we propose a randomized, three-arm, double-blind, controlled, escalating
dose parallel pilot study in which 90 patients with hypothyroidism (30 each group) will be randomized to six
months of treatment with LT4, LT4/LT3 with LT3 once daily, or LT4/LT3 with LT3 twice daily.
 This novel and rigorous study based on our original observations will fill the knowledge gap of effects
and dosing of LT4/LT3 combination therapy, laying the foundation for large multicenter trial(s) able to
demonstrate the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of LT4/LT3 combination therapy, fulfilling the aims of PAS-23-
086."

Early life conditions shape later life health outcomes such as mortality. However, it is not known which early
conditions really matter and why. And are these conditions modifiable by policy? The absence of data that
inform both where individuals lived during childhood and adult health outcomes substantially limits studies on
this topic. To fill this significant gap, we propose constructing a new dataset to investigate the causal impacts
of two environmental conditions that can be modified by local authorities and that likely affect lifetime health:
the quality of school that children attend and the infectious disease environment in which they grow up.
Previous literature typically relies on state-level measures of school quality and uses all-cause early life
mortality in large areas (such as countries or states) as proxies for infectious disease environment. However,
both of these conditions vary enormously within states. In this proposed study, we will construct a new
dataset linking individual childhood environment determinants at a granular level to longevity for large
representative samples of Blacks and Whites (Aim 1). To our knowledge, it will be the largest individual
dataset that follows U.S. residents from birth to death among individuals that survive to middle age. Despite
abundant association studies on how these two conditions affect lifetime health and other outcomes, causal
evidence is rare. We will investigate the causal effects of school quality on adult health and longevity
(Aim 2). We will examine the extent to which individuals who attended high-quality schools in their city of birth
obtained more schooling, had greater returns to the same level of schooling, and lived longer than those who
attended low-quality schools, separately by race. We will follow the approaches of previous work (e.g.,
leveraging state minimum teacher wages) estimating the effects of school quality on economic outcomes but
apply them to investigate effects of substate-level school quality (e.g., average teacher salaries) on longevity.
We will estimate the causal effects of childhood infectious disease exposure on adult health and
longevity (Aim 3). To estimate causal effects of childhood infections (measured by city-level infectious
disease mortality), we will build on existing evidence that there was an important reduction in infectious
disease mortality in cities in the 1920s due to a reduction in immigration and the associated improvement in
living conditions that prevailed in cities. We will also conduct the analysis separately by race. Lastly, we will
examine the interaction of childhood education environment and infectious disease environment on
longevity and their joint effects on racial disparities (Aim 4). We will empirically test if these two
environments complement each other separately by race. We will assess the extent to which these two key
childhood environments explain inequality and racial disparities in longevity."

 Neck pain is a common cause of disability with 33.6 million disability-adjusted life years in the U.S. The
cost for neck pain due to production loss and sick leave are almost nine times higher compared to the
health care costs. However, neck pain is a relative understudied condition with no efficacious treatment
currently available. The first-line treatments are oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to
decrease herniated disc induced inflammation, however, these oral treatments may cause gastrointestinal tract
ulcer/bleeding, liver and kidney injuries. Non-invasive patches can avoid the side effects of oral administration,
but often lack in efficacy due to limited drug penetration blocked by natural skin barrier—stratum corneum. Our
recent development of film electronics that allow to be integrated onto any surface provides an opportunity to
develop this electronic device controlled smart transdermal microneedle pain patch. In this project, we propose
to develop a wireless soft electronics enabled smart microneedle drug delivery patch to manage neck
pain by integrating electronic devices with thermo-responsive therapeutic microneedles. Successful completion
of this project will promote a multimodal patient-centered smart patch in reducing risk for GI upset and first-pass
metabolism of oral drugs and avoiding opioid addiction."

Older adults, and particularly those with Parkinson disease (PD), may experience walking difficulties that
negatively impact their daily function and quality of life. This project will examine the impact of music and
singing on walking performance, with the goal of understanding what types of rhythmic cues are most helpful to
people with Parkinson disease and older adults. Our pilot work suggests that imagined, mental singing while
walking helps people walk faster with greater stability, whereas walking to music also helps people walk faster
but with reduced stability. In Aim 1, we will compare walking while mentally singing to walking while listening to
music, using personalized cues tailored to each person's walking performance. We will also test whether finger
tapping, a rhythmic task similar to walking in many ways, responds similarly while mentally singing and
listening to music. In Aim 2, we will investigate the brain mechanisms underlying the enhancements in
movement performance seen with mental singing or music listening. We will use magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) to measure brain activity during finger tapping with and without various cues to understand which areas
of the brain are more or less responsive to different types of cues. Using the information gained in the first two
aims, we will then conduct an intervention study in Aim 3 to compare and contrast the effects of music-based
vs. singing-based training for people with PD. We will determine which training method results in the greatest
improvements in walking and tapping performance and measure changes in brain activity with training. We will
also ask the participants how acceptable and usable the different training approaches are. This work is among
the first to focus on singing as an intervention to improve walking in PD and is innovative in its use of this
novel, untapped, highly accessible, adaptable, low-cost approach that has the potential to enhance walking,
thereby improving everyday function and quality of life for people with PD."

This work will develop an innovative infusion device that leverages new electronics and sensor
capabilities to produce a medical device that improves intravenous (IV) infusion delivery. IV
infusions are among most common healthcare procedures administered worldwide; an
estimated 80% of hospital patients receive some IV therapy. Infusions are also increasingly
delivered outside of hospital settings, in homes, long-term care facilities, surge settings and
other alternate site care (ASC) environments. ASC infusions, in particular, are a critical
healthcare trend because they increase access to care by eliminating obstacles such as patient
transportation, pathogen exposure for the immunocompromised, and inpatient costs. While
infusion is critical infrastructure for healthcare delivery, the technologies to deliver it have not
kept up with changing needs in the sector. This proposal builds on a clinically-validated
infusion monitoring system, the DripAssist Infusion Rate Monitor, to create a closed-loop,
digitally-connected infusion platform capable of administering even potentially complex drug
regimes in both acute and ASC settings. This technology-enabled gravity infusion delivery
system with automatic flow adjustment, what we call DripAssist Control, will use low cost
sensors to accurately measure the volume of fluid in a drop. This is an experimental study that
will collect data in silico across a predetermined set of dependent and independent variables.
Large data sets will be collected to which both conventional statistical analysis and machine
learning methods will be applied. Our research will utilize rich information confirmed to be
present in outputs of an existing preliminary benchtop system to establish new data processing
methods for measuring drop volume. Once refined, these methods will be optimized into a
closed-loop flow control system, which will be developed into a form and fit device and tested
within clinical settings with realistic constraints and variability. We have three Aims in this
work. Aim 1: establishing two benchtop systems that can broadly identify the drip volume
rating of an infusion set through a novel detection process. Aim 2: optimize our sensing and
actuating algorithms to clinically acceptable precision and accuracy. Aim 3: perform closed-loop
control system integration and preclinical development work to attain a working prototype
device that can be tested for usability and established regulatory standards. We believe our
work can create a bold shift in clinical practice by introducing novel instrumentation and
sensors and producing a simpler infusion delivery device that matches the precision and
accuracy of expensive pump platforms."
10945367,"Cancer patients with elevated depressive symptoms have higher rates of cancer mortality, recurrence,
diminished quality of life (QoL), healthcare expenditure, and chemotherapy nonadherence. Depression also
partially drives racial/ethnic cancer disparities. As such, several advisory groups recommend depression
screening and evidence-based treatment across the cancer continuum. However, only one in four depressed
cancer patients receives evidence-based treatment for depression due to: (1) suboptimal oncologist
referral/prescribing/training compounded by complex algorithms in treatment guidelines; (2) low patient uptake
due to knowledge gaps, cancer-related physical symptoms, stigma; and (3) organizational factors like clinic
culture, resources, and leadership support all resulting in poor patient-provider communication, one-size-fits all
SW referrals, high no show rates and little actual delivery of evidence-based treatment. Despite several
systematic reviews/meta-analyses supporting the effectiveness of several treatments for depression in cancer
patients, few if any theory and equity-informed, multi-level implementation trials exist. There is an urgent need
for hybrid III effectiveness-implementation psycho-oncology trials.
 We propose to test a strategy for efficiently and sustainably delivering complex treatment algorithms/
guidelines, facilitating efficient communication/triage/referral processes for oncology teams within existing
mental health infrastructures, and increasing the proportion of patients who receive evidence-based treatment.
Informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) 2.0, implementation mapping
and user-centered design principles we arrived at iCan DepCare centered around a digital psychoeducation-
activation tool (completed in clinic, infusion sites or home) with treatment selection support (e.g., urgency/
severity/preference based recommendations for SW/financial counseling, individual/group therapy, medication,
exercise OR watchful waiting with linkage to adjunctive pain/mood/exercise apps/resources) and technical
assistance with education/feedback of tool results for oncology/mental health teams to address contextual
barriers to treatment uptake and move clinics along the behavioral integration continuum. Feasibility is
supported by usability testing and a pilot RCT of a prototype; focus groups with racial/ethnic minority cancer
patients/oncology teams; a feasibility study; and vast experience delivering TA, all demonstrating a signal for
usability, effectiveness, and integration into clinical workflows (e.g., leveraging existing screening/treatment).
 We propose to use conjoint analyses to refine our strategy before conducting a clinic-level cluster
randomized trial, informed by the equity and sustainability enhanced REAIM framework, to test the effect of
iCan DepCare (vs. usual care) on treatment optimization, implementation indices, and costs in 18 prostate,
lung, gastrointestinal and breast cancer clinics in community and academic settings serving socioeconomically
diverse patients (n=1900 patients with moderate-severe depressive symptoms)."

Half of heart failure (HF) patients die suddenly, termed as sudden cardiac death (SCD), while HF affects over 5
million people in the United State alone. The current ACC/HF/AHA guidelines recommend implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy for the secondary prevention of SCD and primary prevention in HF
patients. However, significant mortality benefits in ICD implanted HF patients was not shown in randomized
clinical trials. Therefore, development of effective therapies is urgently needed. HF myocardium exhibits
electrophysiologic pathological remodeling that underlies the development of non-reentrant mechanisms
(triggered activity) as well as slowing of conduction in nonischemic HF human hearts that underlie development
of reentry. Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ mishandling impairs excitation-contraction coupling, to play a key role
in triggered arrhythmia in HF. Our group recently discovered a previously unknown form of kinase-on-kinase
crosstalk where JNK2 enhances CaMKII gene expression and activity, CaMKII-regulated SR Ca mishandling
(leak/overload), arrhythmic Ca activities, and triggered delayed afterdepolarization (DADs) in the heart. We
further demonstrated a JNK2-specific action (independent of CaMKII) in SR Ca overload via enhanced SERCA2
Ca uptake, which exacerbates the JNK2-CaMKII-evoked diastolic SR Ca leak and arrhythmogenesis. In addition,
we found that JNK2 downregulates gap junction Cx43 gene expression and impairs cell-to-cell communication,
which promotes reentrant substrate to sustain triggered activities. Our pilot studies show that JNK2 is markedly
activated and upregulated in explanted failing left ventricles (LV) from dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients
compared to healthy control hearts suggesting that JNK2 could be an unexplored contributor to SCD in HF. Although
our preliminary data suggest a key implication for JNK2 in the mechanisms leading to SCD, the upstream
pathway leading to this upregulation of JNK2 remains unknown. Importantly, downregulation of the Potassium
Channel Interacting Protein, KChIP2, has been linked to arrhythmias and SCD. In the absence of KChIP2 there
is enhanced susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias, while restoring KChIP2 expression in a rodent model of
hypertrophy delayed the progression to HF and reduced arrhythmias. Importantly, we demonstrated that KChIP2
is found in the nucleus where it can act as a transcriptional repressor suggesting it could contribute to arrhythmia
mechanisms through transcriptional regulation of cardiac genes. Our preliminary data suggest that KChIP2 can
bind and repress the expression of JNK2. Thus, our central hypothesis for this proposal is that the KChIP2-JNK2
axis plays a critical role in mechanisms leading to arrhythmias and SCD. This proposal will aim on answering
two important questions: 1) how does KChIP2 regulate JNK2 expression? 2) how does the KChIP2-JNK2 axis
promote SCD in HF? Importantly, we will test therapeutic interventions of overexpression of KChIP2 and/or
inhibition of JNK2 as novel anti-arrhythmia strategies for HF patients."

biopsy (LB) to guide the treatment of MEs and advanced MBCs.
 Problem. Drug targets and predictors of response for MBC are tremendous unmet clinical needs. Procuring
solid metastatic tissue can be challenging due to the inaccessibility of disease sites and the risks associated with
tissue collection. A major impetus for this proposed research is the opportunity for LB to circumvent these
limitations. ME circulating tumor cells (ME-CTCs) can serve as surrogates for metastatic tissue for molecular
characterization. However, the low proportion of METCs relative to immune cells in many MEs complicates
profiling efforts.
 Solution. We have collaborated with Deepcell (DC), a company that developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-
assisted, morphology-based approach to isolate ME-CTCs. DC’s biomarker-agnostic platform provides an
advantage over traditional biomarker-based tumor enrichment methods by creating morphological atlases of ME-
CTCs for mining novel biomarkers of treatment response and resistance. Our pilot studies demonstrate the
feasibility of molecular characterization of ME-CTCs isolated using the DC platform.
 Hypothesis. We hypothesize that isolating ME-CTCs using the DC platform and downstream profiling can
facilitate the development of LB tools for evaluating known actionable breast cancer (BCa) biomarkers (e.g.,
ER/PR/HER2, PIK3CA & ESR1 mutations) and discovering new predictive molecular and morphology-based
biomarkers and drug targets.
 Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will first validate the DC platform using primary cells from MEs and ME-derived
organoids. Next, we will use the validated platform to isolate ME-CTCs, generate copy number and mutation
profiles of these cells and matched archival tumors, compare the status of genes frequently mutated in BCa
(e.g., PIK3CA and ESR1), and detect ME-CTC-specific aberrations. In Aim 2, we will perform single-cell RNA
sequencing and immunocytochemistry of isolated ME-CTCs and ME-derived organoids to discover expression-
based biomarkers and assess the status of known BCa biomarkers (e.g., ER/PR/HER2). In Aim 3, we will perform
correlative analyses between treatment response vs. ME-CTC morphology and molecular signatures (Aims 1 &
2) and use ME-derived organoids for validation studies.
 Translational impact. Developing a platform for isolating tumor cells from MEs and liquid biopsy tools to
discover novel response biomarkers and drug targets can transform the treatment of MEs from a palliative setting
to a therapeutic opportunity to improve the outcomes of patients who develop these devastating complications."

The diversity of cell states observed across development, aging, and disease is regulated by the epigenome, an
intricate medley of chromatin states, chemical modifications, protein interactions, and three-dimensional
structures in the nucleus. We and others have developed techniques such as ATAC-seq, CUT&Tag, and In situ
Genome Sequencing (IGS) that use Tn5 transposase to selectively measure different components of the
epigenome, increasingly at single-cell resolution. However, these techniques all suffer from poor yield due to an
inherent challenge: the amount of physical space available for enzymatic reactions in the nucleus is limited. To
address this challenge, we propose a new platform called Expansion Genomics, which will leverage physical
expansion of biological samples to de-crowd the nucleus, vastly increasing the resolution of single-cell and
spatial epigenomics methods. In Aim 1, we describe Single-cell Expansion Genomics, which will combine
expansion with modern single-cell techniques to enable high-throughput, multi-modal measurements without the
need for specialized microfluidic devices. In Aim 2, we describe Spatial Expansion Genomics, which will integrate
expansion with multiplexed spatial imaging approaches to reveal the organization of the epigenome at
nanoscale. These technologies will be designed with ease and accessibility as a guiding principle to facilitate
widespread adoption and broaden our understanding of gene regulatory mechanisms."

Rates of potentially life-threatening IgE mediated food allergy continue to rise, and therapeutic options are
limited. Understanding how to alter immune tolerance in patients with food allergy is paramount to the
development of new therapies. Two types of food allergen immunotherapy, oral immunotherapy (OIT) and
sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT), rely on the administration of gradually increasing amounts of allergen to
induce tolerance. For some children, these therapies can induce a state described as remission, where the
protection against allergic reactions lasts weeks to months after stopping therapy. While current research has
focused on the adaptive immune responses to immunotherapy, the immunologic milieu necessary for these
responses is not known. Using metabolomic profiling, the large-scale quantification of metabolites by mass-
spectrometry, we identified 3 major pathways (bile acids, arachidonic acids, and histidine metabolites) with
known roles in modulating T cell biology that differentiate children who develop remission versus those who do
not. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the role that immunomodulatory metabolites play in the
remission of food allergies induced by immunotherapy. In Aim 1, we will validate the presence of protective
metabolomic signatures of bile acids, arachidonic acids, and histidine pathways in remission using samples
from an interventional trial of OIT in young children. We will then assess how these metabolites change with
immune biomarkers of remission (serology, basophil reactivity, and T cell cytokines). While there are many
similarities in the mechanisms of OIT and SLIT, there is growing evidence for differences in the
pathophysiology of remission induced by these two types of immunotherapy. Based on this, we will study the
immunometabolism of remission in SLIT in Aim 2. Using samples from an interventional trial of SLIT, we will
characterize the presence of these three immunomodulatory metabolite pathways in remission and assess
how these pathways relate to immune biomarkers of remission. Finally, we will compare the metabolomic
profiles of SLIT and OIT to identify shared and disparate pathways between the two types of therapy. We
anticipate that this work will identify mechanisms of allergic tolerance in immunotherapy and inform the
development of new therapies."

Deficits in neuronal development are observed in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders (NDs), and while
research on NDs has historically focused on intrinsic changes within neurons, recent work has identified that
alterations to astrocytes also occur and have functional impact. Unbiased proteomic approaches have identified
a dysregulation in astrocyte protein secretion occurs in astrocytes isolated and cultured from Rett Syndrome
(RTT), Down Syndrome (DS), and Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) model mice when compared to wild-type (WT),
with strong overlap across disorders in protein secretion alterations, suggesting convergent dysregulation. This
proposal focuses on altered protein secretion from astrocytes in Rett Syndrome, a disorder caused by a loss-of-
function mutation of the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (Mecp2) gene. In mouse models of RTT astrocyte-specific
restoration of Mecp2 improves key phenotypes including altered neuronal morphology and motor behavior,
showing that correcting astrocyte dysfunction is beneficial. The goal of the current proposal is to determine if
correcting altered release of specific astrocyte-secreted proteins that impact neuronal development is sufficient
to ameliorate RTT phenotypes, with a focus on the class 3 semaphorin, Sema3c, which shows increased release
from astrocytes in all three NDs. Class 3 semaphorins regulate axon guidance, dendritic spines, and synapse
formation, leading to the hypothesis that increased Sema3c causes dysregulation of these developmental
process in RTT. Preliminary experiments demonstrate RTT mice with reduced levels of astrocyte Sema3c show
phenotypic improvement including increased body weight and corrected anxiety-like behavior. Aim 1 addresses
how this occurs on a cellular level by asking if Sema3c reduction impacts neuronal morphology, synaptic balance,
and synaptic function. In vitro experiments show that increasing the level of Sema3c is sufficient to inhibit neurite
outgrowth, suggesting upregulation of Sema3c contributes to reduced dendritic arbor size and spine density that
are observed in RTT. To identify how Sema3c signals to neurons to inhibit their development in RTT, proximity
labeling with TurboID is used to identify the in vivo Sema3c protein interactome, analyzed by mass spectrometry.
This Aim will provide mechanistic insight into how increased Sema3c in RTT drives neurodevelopmental
dysregulation, and how reducing Sema3c may improve RTT phenotypes. Prior work that identified altered protein
secretion from astrocytes in RTT studied early postnatal astrocytes in isolation from other cell types. To ask how
astrocyte-neuron interaction is altered in RTT in vivo at later ages when phenotypes emerge, Aim 2 uses TurboID
proximity labeling to identify the secreted and plasma membrane proteins of astrocytes and neurons in the cortex
of RTT and WT mice. These datasets will identify further potential therapeutic targets for neurodevelopmental
disorders. Together these Aims address the role of astrocyte Sema3c in underlying RTT phenotypes, and identify
protein-level changes in astrocyte-neuron communication in RTT in vivo, using mouse molecular genetic tools
and innovative in vivo proximity labeling proteomic approaches."

As the global population ages, unraveling the fundamental mechanisms behind aging and devising strategies
to extend our years of healthy living has gained paramount significance. Aging-related musculoskeletal
disorders like osteoarthritis, tendinopathy, sarcopenia, and osteoporosis are some of the most prevalent and
incapacitating conditions linked to advancing age. While conventional pathways in aging research have
historically prepared trainees for academic careers, this approach now falls short, given the predominantly non-
academic landscape of post-training career prospects. To unlock the full potential of aging research for
enhancing human health and overall well-being, it's imperative to diversify and cultivate numerous career
trajectories for scientists. This Aging Research and Entrepreneurial Development Immersion (REDI) R25
proposal aims to provide outstanding training in aging research and exposure to multiple career paths,
such as biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, medical device industry, and academic research. This training will
equip scientists with the skills and knowledge necessary to translate their research successfully and have a
greater impact on society. The Aging-REDI (A-REDI) program has the following goals: (1) To provide
comprehensive training in translational aging research and diverse career paths across academia, industry,
and entrepreneurship; (2) To cultivate practical experience in various dimensions of translational research;
(3) To develop exceptional communication and presentation skills; and (4) to foster a collaborative,
interdisciplinary, and inclusive training environment. To accomplish these goals, the A-REDI program entails
an initial 6-month didactic stipend-based participation period for 15 total doctoral or postdoctoral trainees,
followed by a 6-month immersive period to advance the translation of academic research projects. Support for
translation will be provided through contract service providers (regulatory, clinical, and business consultants),
lawyers (corporate, transactional, and intellectual property support), and health/life science entrepreneurs. The
A-REDI curriculum and associated available funding will enable trainees to pursue research in aging, while
simultaneously offering them a deeper understanding of the steps required to translate their findings into viable
products and explore careers outside of academia that allow them to continue work in aging research. This
training plan will not only enable publications and abstract submissions, but also new IP generation, the
formation of new startups, and exposure to careers in aging innovation."

Air pollution constitutes a multifaceted environmental challenge with far-reaching implications for public health
and policy formulation. This research aims to deepen our understanding of the combined effects of air pollution
mixtures on health outcomes. By quantifying the health impacts of pollution mixtures, we can improve risk as-
sessments, design more effective regulatory policies, and develop comprehensive strategies for monitoring and
mitigating multiple pollutants. Air pollution presents distinctive analytical challenges due to its high-dimensional
nature, as well as the presence of between-pollutant correlations due to common sources, transport, and atmo-
spheric chemistry. Conventional methodologies, which either isolate individual pollutant constituents or naively
reduce dimensionality, often yield imprecise assessments of combined effects. These shortcomings are often
due to oversights of confounding factors when performing dimension reduction, potentially leading to less ef-
fective policy decisions to protect public health. To address these challenges, this research proposes innovative
dimension reduction techniques based on causal structural models. These techniques aim to preserve the causal
relationships between air pollution mixtures and health outcomes while making minimal assumptions about data
distribution. Successful completion of these aims promises more accurate assessments of air pollution’s impact
on health. We further intend to employ a diverse array of established techniques, alongside our own novel ap-
proaches, on a comprehensive dataset of emergency department visits in Atlanta, spanning over two decades.
Specifically, building upon previous single-pollutant analyses, we will examine short-term health effects of differ-
ent air pollution mixtures, including criteria pollutants, fine particulate species, and volatile organic compounds.
This endeavor will serve to quantify the tangible health ramifications of air pollution within a real-world context.
Insights from this application will inform public health interventions, enhance air quality standards, and support
evidence-based policy decisions. We also anticipate that the methodology can be applied to other environmental
mixtures of concern beyond air pollution. In summary, this research bridges critical gaps in understanding the
health effects of air pollution by pioneering innovative dimension reduction techniques. By preserving causal
relationships, it enhances the accuracy of assessments and offers more informed policy recommendations. With
a team of leading experts in causal inference and air pollution epidemiology, this research is uniquely positioned
to improve community well-being through health protection."

Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation (HSCT) represents the only curative therapy for most hematologic
disease including leukemia. HSCT requires donor HSCs to engage with the proper supporting niche, survive,
proliferate, and differentiate into mature blood lineages. Recent studies suggest that “stress hematopoiesis”,
including that which occurs post-HSCT, is subject to distinct regulation compared steady-state hematopoiesis.
A better understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate transplanted HSCs and their engraftment is
necessary to improve HSCT, especially in situations where transplant is limited by small cell numbers (e.g. cord
blood) or potentially compromised by ex vivo manipulation (e.g. gene therapy). Towards this, the main goal of
this project is to identify and characterize novel key intrinsic regulators of HSCT. My work reveals high expression
of multiple GPRASPs (G-Protein Coupled Receptor Associated Sorting Proteins) (e.g. Gprasp1 and Gprasp2) in
HSCs, relative to downstream progenitors. I have also found that both GPRASP1 and GPRASP2 act as negative
regulators of HSCT. Gprasp-deficient HSCs present enhanced homing, survival and quiescence during
transplant. This phenotype appears dependent on Cxcr4, a master regulator of HSCs function, whose sequence
contains a putative GASP-binding motif. Indeed, ectopic Cxcr4 enhances HSC homing, survival and quiescence
during transplant, phenocopying loss of Gprasp1 or Gprasp2. Further, my preliminary studies show that, upon
Gprasp1 or Gprasp2 loss, CXCR4 is stabilized and accumulates on HSCs, sensitizing them to SDF-1. CXCR4
has also been implicated in regulating cell-to-cell contact between B-cell progenitors and stroma cells.
Interesting, my recent data suggests that GPRASP loss may also perturb B-cell production by blocking the
differentiation of lymphoid progenitors. Finally, although HSCs as a population are highly enriched for Gprasp1
and Gprasp2 expression, my recent analyses of single cell gene expression data and single HSCs by
immunofluorescence reveals that the expression of these genes is heterogeneous amongst individual HSCs.
This differential expression corresponds with distinct gene expression profiles (e.g. stemness, cell cycle, B-cell
differentiation). Although clonal analyses have revealed that even highly purified HSCs display diverse
differentiation potential, the molecular regulation of this functional heterogeneity is currently poorly understood.
Thus, I hypothesize that multiple GPRASP family members regulate HSC transplantation and B-cell
differentiation, and correlate with HSC functional heterogeneity. The mentored phase of this proposal will occur
at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, under Dr. Shannon McKinney-Freeman. In the independent phase, I
will confirm and extend my studies of the molecular link between GPRASPs and CXCR4 in HSCT and B-cell
differentiation, as well as exploit novel molecular reporters to refine HSC functional heterogeneity. The
institutional resources and academic environment and the planned courses outlined in my proposal will ensure
my successful transition to independence."
10951645,"Candida albicans is among the most significant human fungal pathogens. It can undergo two well-studied cell
type transitions, yeast-hyphal and white-opaque. The yeast-hyphal transition is required for both virulence and
biofilm formation; the white-opaque transition is required for mating. Each transition occurs in distinct growth
conditions, and the regulatory network that governs the transitions seems structured to ensure that the
transitions are mutually exclusive.
 Our recent studies indicate that two white-opaque regulators, Wor1 and Wor3, have unexpected
positive roles in biofilm and hypha formation and in host cell damage and virulence. Importantly, we find that
Wor3-regulated genes are not the typical hypha-associated genes that are already known to promote biofilm,
hyphae, and virulence. Our objective is to use this newly discovered role of Wor3 to define new mediators of
biofilm and hypha formation and virulence, and to use the analytical strategies that were successful for Wor3 to
test the roles of other white-opaque regulators in these central pathogenicity traits.
 The analysis of Wor3 has exploited two genetic interaction strategies. One is an overexpression-
rescue assay, in which we ask if increased expression of one gene can overcome the phenotypic defect of a
deletion mutant in another gene. The second is a synthetic defect assay, in which as ask if a deletion mutation
in one gene causes a unique or prominent phenotype when combined with a deletion mutation in another
gene. Our proposed studies apply these assays systematically to the other Wor regulators in combination with
well-known regulators of hypha and biofilm formation to define new gene functions and targets. Our specific
aims are to define functional roles of Wor regulators in biofilm and hypha formation, and to define functional
roles of Wor regulators in host interaction and virulence. Our longer-term goal is to use novel targets of Wor
regulators to define new determinants of pathogenicity and biofilm persistence."

Women are disproportionally susceptible to osteoporosis with generally poorer treatment outcomes. For
decades, research regarding this difference was focused on the action of sex hormones. More recently,
genetic, and epigenetic mechanisms have been recognized to significantly contribute to sex differences in
bone mass. There is a critical need to understand the contribution of genetic differences to sex-bias in bone
mass regulation, especially those linked to sex chromosomes.
We observed that loss of the X-linked chromatin modifying enzyme, KDM5C, increases bone mass exclusively
in females. The objective of this proposal is to determine the mechanisms by which KDM5C regulates female
bone mass. We hypothesize that KDM5C transcriptionally programs a wide spectrum of genes that act
synergistically to regulate osteoclast (OC) differentiation and function, and that inhibition of KDM5C will prevent
age and pathology-induced bone loss. We, Dr. Tao Yang (MPI, expert in skeletal biology) and Dr. Connie
Krawczyk (MPI, expert in immunology and metabolism), have assembled a motivated team to address this
hypothesis. We will first investigate how loss of KDM5C affects OC function, how OCs communicate with
osteoblasts (OB) via cross-talk, and OC energy metabolism. We will also define how KDM5C regulates
epigenetic programming in OC progenitors, using genomic and epigenetic profiling analyses. Finally, as a first
step toward the development of therapeutics, we will examine the impact of KDM5C deletion and
pharmacological inhibition on estrogen-deficiency induced, inflammation induced, or age-related mouse
models of osteoporosis.
Impact: In this study, we will define how KDM5C-mediated epigenetic programming of OC regulates bone
mass in females. These results will help to establish a multifaceted molecular network integrating epigenetic
status, gene expression, metabolism, and bone microenvironment for a better understanding of OC
programming and bone mass regulation between sexes. This is an important step toward our long-term goal to
uncover the genetic factors and their mechanisms that can be targeted to improve women’s bone health."

Innovation in chronic disease management is urgently needed to effectively control hypertension (HTN) in
Ghana and Nigeria. Both countries are suffering silent epidemics of chronic diseases with rates closely
resembling those of high-income countries. Uncontrolled HTN causes cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic
kidney disease, and premature death. However, HTN is poorly controlled in both countries due to patient-,
provider, and system-level barriers. A pressing global health challenge is implementing evidence-based and
contextually appropriate strategies to improve chronic disease management in Ghana and Nigeria. Multilevel
interventions improve HTN control. For instance, team-based care, a health systems-level and organizational
intervention, improves the quality of HTN care. Telehealth can be enhanced with home blood pressure
monitoring (HBPM) to address patient-, and provider-level barriers. The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred
efforts to increase access to timely and appropriate care through re-engineering primary care to be patient-
centered and digitally enabled. Sphygmo Home, a remote telemonitoring app that links with validated blood
pressure (BP) and glucose monitoring devices, is a promising solution to improve patients’ self-management of
chronic disease. In a previous pilot study, we investigated the impact of a multilevel and digitally-enabled home-
based intervention compared to enhanced usual care (UC). After 12 months, 80.5% in the intervention arm,
compared to 24.2% in the enhanced UC arm, had controlled BP (p <0.001). Given the promising findings, we
designed a larger scale trial, consisting of an innovative multilevel intervention linking HBPM with a
telemonitoring platform (Sphygmo Home app), team-based care including physicians and nurses, and the
use of simplified hypertension treatment protocol at hospitals, to improve HTN control. Using a hybrid type 2
effectiveness-implementation design among 800 adults with uncontrolled HTN clustered in 16 hospitals
across 3 regions (Ashanti, Northern, and Bono) in Ghana and in Ondo state, Nigeria, we seek to 1) Assess the
effect of the ADHINCRA Program in improving BP control at 12 months using a stepped wedge cluster
randomized trial of adults with uncontrolled HTN (systolic BP ≥140 mm Hg) and 2) Use the Pragmatic Robust
Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) to evaluate the reach, adoption, and maintenance of the
ADHINCRA Program at 12- and 24-months post-randomization and explore contextual factors that are
associated with the adoption and maintenance of the program in each site using the Service Availability and
Readiness Assessment (SARA) tool. Through early and continued stakeholder engagement with health system
leaders, providers, and patients, we seek to close the wide “know-do-gap” and reduce global chronic disease
disparities. We also propose a comprehensive dissemination strategy to reach critical audiences and achieve
buy-in, policy, and practice change."

The cerebellum is involved in refining motor and cognitive-affective processes in diverse complex behaviors
that engage neuromodulatory systems. However, how neuromodulation dynamically adapts cerebellar
processing to the ever-changing demands of physiological state and behavioral context remains a critical
knowledge gap. Especially the mechanisms of peptidergic neuromodulation remain elusive because slow-
acting signals were long thought to play a minor role in cerebellar function. However, recent large-scale gene
expression studies revealed a wealth of neuropeptide receptor types in the mouse cerebellar cortex,
suggesting that they may have a profound impact on cerebellar processing. Among those receptors, we
identified receptors for oxytocin, a highly conserved neuropeptide associated with diverse social behaviors.
We, therefore, hypothesize that the cerebellum is part of the oxytocin-sensitive brain networks that facilitate
social behavior in specific physiological contexts. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the fundamental
cellular and circuit mechanisms by which oxytocin regulates cerebellar processing. The cerebellar cortex is
composed of three layers and relatively few cell types. Synaptic input from sensory and higher-order brain
areas arrives via mossy fibers that are integrated in granule cells of the input layer. Granule cell axons then
excite interneurons and the cerebellar cortical output neurons, the Purkinje cells. The excitability of granule
cells critically depends on inhibition provided by Golgi interneurons. Our initial findings suggest that oxytocin
robustly excites Golgi interneurons, leading to an increased inhibitory tone in the input layer. We propose that
this mechanism dynamically regulates granule cell excitability, the integration of mossy fiber input, and
ultimately Purkinje cell output. To test these hypotheses, we first aim to determine the types and distribution of
oxytocin-binding receptors across the cerebellar cortex and investigate the effects of oxytocin on neuronal
activity and synaptic transmission. We will then examine the circuit mechanisms that underlie the remarkably
robust Golgi cell network excitation by oxytocin. Finally, we aim to better understand the effects of oxytocin on
cerebellar cortical oscillations and Purkinje cell output in awake behaving mice. Our study will establish the
cerebellum as an oxytocin-sensitive brain region and form the basis for investigating how peptidergic
neuromodulation reconfigures cerebellar output to control behavior, potentially bridging the gap between the
cognitive-affective and motor effects of oxytocin in affiliative behaviors. These findings might be relevant for
numerous neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and neurological disorders characterized by impairments in both
the social communication and motor domains."

Sleep patterns characterized by truncated weekday sleep followed by weekend recovery sleep (‘social jetlag’)
often begin to emerge during pre-adolescence (8-12 years). Research from our team has demonstrated that
this sleep pattern adversely impacts positive valence systems (PVS) in ways that elevate risk for depression
and other psychiatric disorders. Heightened neuroplasticity and re-organization of reward-related brain regions
present during this period of the lifespan likely confer a unique opportunity for prevention and intervention, but
research on sleep-affective relations during this vulnerable period of development remains limited. The present
set of studies will examine mechanistic pathways between behavioral and neurophysiological (EEG) sleep
patterns and PVS in social and non-social contexts during pre-adolescence. Study 1 includes an intensive one-
year longitudinal burst design with a non-clinical sample of youth (N = 290; ages 8-12). At three separate
assessment waves (6 months apart), participants will complete a 14-day monitoring period including objective
sleep using actigraphy, daily video diaries and surveys, passive audio recordings of naturalistic social
interactions, and a series of behavioral tasks to assess reward responsiveness, learning, and valuation. This
longitudinal study is complemented by Study 2, which includes a separate sample of non-clinical youth (N =
64; ages 10-12) who will complete an experimental protocol using a randomized crossover design. Participants
will stay in the laboratory with a friend for two 5-night visits where dyads will simultaneously undergo multiple
nights of sleep restriction followed by recovery sleep, as well as 5 nights of healthy sleep. Each evening in the
lab, participants will complete surveys and paradigms assessing social and non-social reward responsiveness,
learning, and valuation. A daily recorded interaction period with their peer will also be coded for positive social
behaviors (approach behaviors, affective synchrony, positive affective expression, and gaze patterns using eye
tracking). Participants will also complete polysomnography during each night of the laboratory protocols and
changes in sleep EEG (i.e., rapid eye movement sleep) will be examined as a mechanism underlying daytime
socioemotional changes. Additional analyses for both studies focus on how biological sex modifies
socioemotional vulnerability to sleep patterns. The proposed research addresses multiple critical gaps in
scientific knowledge surrounding the impact of sleep on the development of reward systems and social
functioning during pre-adolescence. Specific aims leverage RDoC, including PVS and Arousal/Regulatory
systems, and support NIMH’s strategic plan to chart mental illness trajectories and determine when, where,
and how to intervene. Results will inform theories of these neurodevelopmental processes to better inform
prevention and treatment efforts."

 Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is the most common bone fragility disease, with an incidence of approximately 1
in 10,000-20,000 worldwide and 25,000–50,000 in the US. OI is an inherited genetic disorder, and symptoms
include low bone mass, recurrent bone fractures following minor trauma, bowing of the long bones, vertebral
compression, scoliosis, bone pain, stunted growth, and ligamentous and joint laxity. Up to 85% of OI patients
have autosomal dominant mutations in either the COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene that encodes the pro-1(I) or pro-
2(I) polypeptide chains of type I collagen, the major structural protein of bone. Current drug treatments primarily
focus on improving bone mineralization and show limited success because they cannot correct these mutations
that disrupt collagen production. In addition, currently developing OI cell therapy has several challenges, such as
limited mesenchymal stem cells from healthy donors, susceptibility to transplantation damage, bone targeting
complexities, and immune rejection risks. To address these unmet needs, this proposal will develop and evaluate
in vivo gene editing strategies to repair collagen mutations in mouse models of OI using bone-targeting
recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV). Gene editing is one of the promising gene therapy approaches for
rare diseases. However, it has not been reported that “gene editing based gene therapy for OI patients and its
preclinical animal models. Recently, we confirmed that the CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing approach could
reverse the OI animal phenotypes with gene correction of the mutation site. However, the Cas9-based gene
editing strategy induced a small percentage of off-target effects such as insertion, deletion, and replacement,
which is an inevitable problem accompanied by the blunt-end double-strand DNA break (DSB) induced by the
Cas9 protein and NHEJ, one of two DNA repairing processes of DSB. To avoid DSB-induced off-target effects,
we will utilize 1) single-strand DNA break using a Cas9-nickase (Prime-Editing, PE), 2) staggered double-strand
DNA break using Cas12a, 3) non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) inhibition, and 4) homology-directed repair
(HDR) boosting. Successful completion of these aims will provide a proof-of-concept demonstration and compare
the therapeutic efficacy of bone-targeting rAAV-based genome editing strategies to treat OI. Our skeletal gene
therapy will not only provide OI patients with alternative treatment options but also develop a new platform that
can be applied to treat other skeletal diseases."

 The development of efficacious medications for AUD remains a high research priority with current emphases
on identifying novel molecular targets and efficiently screening new compounds. Pharmacological modulation of the
kynurenine pathway (KP) represents a promising novel target for AUD. The KP is a complex enzymatic cascade with
each step producing biologically active metabolites that are critically involved in diverse physiological and pathological
processes. Chronic alcohol exposure produces dysregulation of the KP, particularly as evidenced by decreased levels
of the neuroprotective metabolite kynurenic acid (KYNA) and increased levels of the neurotoxic metabolite quinolinic
acid (QUIN). This metabolic shift is associated with various alcohol-related pathologies in animals and humans. Thus,
a medication that targets the KP to restore KYNA and attenuate QUIN levels may be an effective treatment for AUD.
The enzyme kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) is a major gatekeeper of the KP and resultant KYNA levels. KMO
inhibition shifts the KP towards KYNA production in brain and away from QUIN production. Critically, KMO inhibition in
rodents, through its increase in brain KYNA levels, decreases alcohol self-administration, preference, cue-reactivity,
and relapse behaviors. However, KMO-inhibitors have not been tested in humans because of presumed lack of
availability. Diclofenac is an FDA-approved Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug that was recently discovered to
inhibit KMO activity. Consistent with KMO inhibition, diclofenac increases KYNA levels in the brain and periphery of
rodents. However, it remains unknown whether diclofenac increases KYNA levels and affects alcohol-related
behaviors in humans at approved, safe dosages. In a Phase Ia/b proof of concept study, we will test the
pharmacological mechanism, optimal dosing, tolerability, and initial efficacy of diclofenac as a potential novel
treatment for AUD. We will conduct a randomized, double-blind, dose-escalating, placebo-controlled, cross-over study
in which individuals with AUD (n=24) complete four sessions where they receive diclofenac (25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg)
or placebo. Our primary aim is to identify the dose by which diclofenac, vs. placebo, produces changes to the KP
indicative of KMO inhibition (e.g., increasing KYNA levels). We will also assess whether diclofenac, vs. placebo,
decreases tonic alcohol craving and negative mood, attenuates alcohol cue-reactivity, and improves cognitive
function. Findings will inform subsequent studies testing diclofenac for AUD as well as other disorders for which KMO
inhibition has been identified as a pharmacological target of interest."

Uveitis is a common cause of blindness in the United States. The specific cause of uveitis is often unknown,
making it difficult to implement targeted testing and treatment. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence
(AI) and ultrahigh-resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT), we will develop novel tools to help diagnose
and classify uveitis by characterizing the distribution and type of inflammatory response within the eye. OCT
will be used to image multiple areas in the aqueous and vitreous media of the eye and count the density of
inflammatory cells. AI analysis will further classify cell types to aid in differential diagnosis. Protein levels in the
media will be estimated based on the intensity of background scattering. Together, the cell count and protein
level can be used to monitor the patient’s disease severity and response to treatment. The precision of OCT is
ideal for clinical trials, where precise outcome measures can accelerate drug development and save costs. To
further these goals, specific aims of the project are:
 (1) Develop ultrahigh-resolution OCT for imaging the anterior and vitreous media of the eye.
 (2) Quantify and classify inflammation in the aqueous and vitreous humor of uveitis patients. We will
 develop OCT-based biomarkers to aid in the differential diagnosis of uveitis and assessment of
 disease severity."

as identifiable and quantifiable label for individual nanoparticles in a pooled mixture. However,
notwithstanding the exponentially growing number of novel gene-carrying nanoparticles,
researchers have not been equally attracted to in vivo high-throughput screening via this
barcoding technology. The long-term objective of our proposed study is to offer a broadly
accessible and therefore accepted tool for non-viral gene delivery research, by offering
several key innovative elements that address the shortcomings of the current method.
Specifically, our novel barcodes composed of deuterated peptoid, labelled Deuterated Oligo-
Peptoid Add-on as Nanoparticle Tracer (DOPANT), will demonstrate inert nanoparticle loading
process, biological stability, simplified extraction and purification protocols, as well as
affordable and sensitive detection method. To that end, the Emmitte group will synthesize
DOPANT barcodes, a library of 3-mer peptoids with varying molecular weights based on the
degree of deuteration and the choice of monomer, to be co-loaded with the genetic cargo into
nanoparticle formulations (Aim 1). The Kim group will then validate the DOPANT barcode-
labeled nanoparticles and their applications in a high-throughput biodistribution study. The
parameters in formulating a cocktail solution of multiple DOPANT-loaded nanoparticles will be
fine-tuned for optimal performance in biodistribution screening (Aim 2). Finally, DOPANT
barcode technology will be validated through a proof-of-principle, biodistribution study of 10
different mRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles in healthy mice of two strains and both sexes (Aim
3). This collaborative project brings in the complementary expertise of two research groups to
develop a novel enabling tool that can advance and accelerate the path to clinical translation
for many existing and forthcoming nanoparticle designs."

Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease with striking heterogeneity of clinical course and increasing
mortality and morbidity rates. Diagnosis is difficult and predicting disease outcomes is virtually impossible.
While it is known that sarcoidosis likely involves host genetic susceptibility and a dysregulated immune
response to any number of environmental factors, the mechanisms by which granulomas form and the
determinants of severity and disease manifestations remain elusive. Our team has been at the forefront of
genetics and transcriptomics in sarcoidosis, including the identification of genes for susceptibility, severity,
ancestry- and organ-specific effects, the first and only single-cell RNA sequencing study of sarcoidosis and the
first GWAS of pulmonary fibrosis in patients of African ancestry (AA). These findings provide the foundation for
further dissection of cellular mechanisms that lead to systemic immune dysregulation and tissue-specific
inflammatory response. Our current proposal will advance the field by filling critical gaps in sarcoidosis
research, including the lack of biomarkers for sarcoidosis diagnosis and prognosis, and the absence
of mechanistic connections between genetics, genomics, and immune profiles, in the periphery and
affected organs. We will exploit the immunological, genomic, and bioinformatic expertise of our team to apply
an innovative, iterative, and integrative multi-omic approach to discover molecular signatures characterizing
sarcoidosis and its disease burden. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will use circulating protein levels from over 200
sarcoidosis patients of AA and European ancestry (EA) and 200 controls to a) develop predictive models of
sarcoidosis susceptibility and disease burden via a novel application of machine learning, and b) define unique
immune cell subsets based on cell-specific expression of cytokines of interest, and thus identify novel
candidate genes and pathways. In Aim 2, we will identify candidate genes that are best suited for functional
and drug target studies based on integrating the data collected across multiple biological systems (including
genetic, transcriptomics, and proteomics), from multiple sample sources (including circulating immune cells
and brochoalveolar lavage). Our work will be greatly facilitated by the extensive genetic, genomic, and clinical
data available to us from our own cohorts (>2,900 EA and >3,000 AA) and the TOPMed Consortium (of which
we are members). This application includes a novel approach to integrating data across multiple biological
systems, with strong preliminary data to support the rigor and success of our proposal."
10954085,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This K76 proposal describes the five-year career development plan of Dr. Sarah Nouri, an Assistant Professor
in the Division of Palliative Medicine at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). Dr. Nouri's long-term
career goal is to become a leader in ensuring equitable access to high-quality serious illness care for
marginalized older adults. Millions of older adults in the US have serious illness and suffer due to poorly
controlled symptoms, such as pain and shortness of breath. These symptoms are difficult to monitor and often
result in emergency room visits, particularly for the >7 million homebound older adults who rely on caregivers.
Homebound older adults are more likely to have cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's Disease or Alzheimer's
Disease Related Dementias (CI/ADRD), be economically disadvantaged, and be racially or ethnically
minoritized. Caregivers experience distress related to older adults' symptom burden because of challenges
assessing symptom severity and knowing when and how to reach out to patients' primary care teams for
support. Dr. Nouri previously evaluated a caregiver-facing, paper-based Symptom Assessment (SA) Toolkit
and found it was acceptable and usable. However, study participants reported needing: 1) support for
CI/ADRD-unique neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., behavior and sleep disturbances), 2) clarification of primary
care workflows for symptom follow-up, and 3) a digital solution. Other remote symptom tools focus on people
with cancer and not older adults, exclude those with CI/ADRD, are not caregiver-facing, and were not created
with racially, ethnically, or socioeconomically diverse populations. To address these gaps, Dr. Nouri proposes
co-development and evaluation of a digital symptom assessment tool with caregivers and primary care teams
of homebound, Medicaid-enrolled older adults with serious illness (including CI/ADRD). The aims are to: 1)
adapt the SA-Toolkit content to include unique CI/ADRD-related symptoms and define an ideal implementation
strategy, 2) co-design a digital Caregiver Empowerment and Symptom Assessment tool (CARES) with
caregivers and primary care teams, and 3) conduct pilot feasibility testing of CARES. These objectives support
Dr. Nouri's career development activities focused on implementation science: 1) advanced qualitative methods,
2) intervention development with user-centered design methods, and 3) randomized trial design. Dr. Nouri will
conduct all work at UCSF with an exceptional mentoring team led by Dr. Rebecca Sudore. This proposal will
provide Dr. Nouri with the training and resources to develop the first digital symptom assessment tool to
empower caregivers of homebound older adults, including those with CI/ADRD. It will also lay the groundwork
for a randomized controlled trial of CARES and continued development of novel care delivery models to meet
the growing serious illness care needs of older adults. It will also provide advanced research and leadership
skills to launch Dr. Nouri's career as an independent investigator and leader at the intersection of aging
research, palliative medicine, and health equity for marginalized older adult populations."

 Central Nervous System (CNS) polypharmacy is a cumulative exposure to 3 or more medications
with CNS-acting properties. CNS medications include anticholinergics, antidepressants, antipsychotics,
benzodiazepines, gabapentinoids, hypnotics, opioids, and muscle relaxants. A growing number of older
Americans are prescribed multiple CNS-acting medications and are affected by CNS polypharmacy,
which is rapidly becoming a wide-spread geriatric syndrome. CNS polypharmacy leads to adverse
outcomes such as physical and cognitive impairment and medication-related falls, serious injuries,
hospitalization, diminished quality of life, and even death. Deprescribing, the systematic process of
tapering or stopping medications, offers potential to reduce the burden of CNS medications. However,
deprescribing may also result in the exacerbation of underlying symptoms for which CNS medications
were originally prescribed. Existing guidelines, such as Beers or STOPP, do not take into consideration
the complex interplay of multiple medications and individual patient’s unique clinical characteristics, which
are necessary for individualized, patient-centered care. Essential are individualized deprescribing
solutions that account for these complexities.
 This project will identify varying benefits and harms of deprescribing across individuals and
medications classes. We will then subsequently develop individualized treatment rules (ITRs) for
personalized medication discontinuation recommendations based on patients’ unique clinical
characteristics to support clinical practice. First, using causal inference methods, we will analyze
PCORNet multi-site electronic health record (EHR) data with linked Medicare claims data to quantify the
probability of medication discontinuation based on patients’ observed clinical characteristics. Then we
will employ supervised and unsupervised machine learning (ML) methods, such as decision trees and
clustering techniques, to accurately predict patient outcomes after medication class discontinuation
based on that patient’s unique clinical characteristics.
 Our team will leverage prior experience in causal inference and machine learning applied to EHR
data to estimate deprescribing's clinical benefits and harms. We'll ultimately integrate these results into
a user-friendly clinical interface, ensuring trustworthy ML and transparent model decision-making
processes. As an initial step, we'll engage clinicians, patients, and community partners early in the design
phase to assess understanding and trust in ML-based deprescribing guidance. This will prepare us for a
future large-scale clinical trial to test the efficacy in achieving deprescribing goals."

Lactation mastitis is an extremely painful and debilitating condition that affects 10-25% of breastfeeding people
and can progress to breast abscess or septic fever. This significant disease burden occurs mostly during the first
six months when birthing people are still in recovery from pregnancy and childbirth. The objective of the proposed
study is to compare classes of antibiotics on first-line treatment failure and document disparities in severity at
presentation and antibiotic prescription rates by race/ethnicity. Our central hypotheses are that some treatments
are more effective than others for avoiding treatment failure and that there are measurable disparities in severity
at presentation and treatments prescribed by race/ethnicity. We will construct a cohort of >5,000 diagnosed
mastitis cases utilizing a nationwide healthcare claims dataset and conduct rigorous analyses to explore these
hypotheses. Our team is uniquely poised to answer these critical research questions and includes an infectious
disease epidemiologist, a lactation clinician who co-authored the current mastitis treatment guidelines, and an
expert in using claims data to asses downstream impacts of medication use. Specifically, we aim to: (1) Compare
the effectiveness of classes of antibiotics (e.g., first and second generation penicillins, cephalosporins,
lincosamides, sulfonamides) prescribed for lactation mastitis on first-line treatment failure, abscess, and hospital
admission. We hypothesize that given community and hospital transmission of MRSA, short-course penicillins
will have the highest rate of first-line treatment failure. (2) Describe disparities by race/ethnicity in the severity of
mastitis at presentation and the antibiotic prescription patterns after mastitis diagnosis. We hypothesize that
given barriers to antenatal care and implicit provider bias, Black and Latina/e/x breastfeeding people will present
with more severe cases of mastitis and are prescribed antibiotics less frequently after diagnosis in comparison
with white breastfeeding people. The proposed study will make significant and novel contributions toward
understanding current patterns in antibiotic prescriptions for mastitis treatment and the relative effectiveness of
current antibiotic treatments. The formation of a mastitis diagnosis cohort using the Optum dataset will provide
a platform to assess a number of other important factors such as local antibiotic resistance patterns and to
assess the impact of changing policies (both mastitis treatment and antibiotic stewardship policies) on successful
treatment. These results will also provide information on the most effective treatments to assess in future
randomized trials. Innovative aspects of our proposal include: (1) high-quality observational studies that advance
our understanding and can guide the design of future randomized trials, (2) assessment of treatment disparities
by race/ethnicity which is critical for responding to clinical and social realities, and (3) large data that covers the
US geographically."

Autoantibodies initiate inflammation and tissue injury in patients with autoimmune disease. Antibody specificity
(for both foreign- and self-antigens) is determined by clonal selection, which is a function of survival and
proliferation of B cells at key developmental and peripheral activation bottlenecks. Autoreactive B cell clones
are primarily removed by apoptosis-dependent negative selection, and foreign antigen-specific B cells are mainly
amplified by proliferation-driven positive selection. The same extracellular ligands (e.g., CD40L and BAFF) that
drive positive selection of protective B cells also rescue self-specific B cells from apoptotic negative selection. A
key limitation in the field is that we do not currently understand the mechanisms underlying B cell responses to
selection ligands that distinguish between foreign-reactive and autoreactive B cells. We have found that the
ubiquitin ligase Itch, an essential autoimmune suppressor, specifically promotes apoptosis in negatively selected
B cells exposed to survival ligands, but not B cells responding to normal positive selection cues. CD40L and
BAFF activate the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in B cells, inducing an array of
metabolic changes to support proliferation and survival, ultimately dictating selection. Mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation has recently emerged as an essential regulator of apoptosis. We found that Itch regulates a
downstream branch of mTORC1-dependent mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation through a distinct
mechanism from its role in limiting upstream mTORC1 activation. This proposal will define Itch-regulated
metabolic pathways in B cells that distinguish selection of foreign-antigen specific as compared to autoreactive
B cell responses."

The long-term goal is to understand how basal forebrain (BF) circuits underlie cognitive functions like
sustained attention. Traditionally, BF was thought to mediate attention through its cholinergic neurons
and cortical acetylcholine release. However, recent recordings suggest that cholinergic signaling
reflects arousal and reinforcement learning instead. If not cholinergic neurons, what alternative BF
circuits support attention?
The objective of this proposal is to determine the circuit and behavioral roles of an understudied BF
population: parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons (BF-PV) that project to the cortex. Our
previous work using a sustained attention-demanding auditory detection task revealed that BF
cholinergic neurons respond to reinforcement surprises, independent of temporal fluctuations of
attention. This discovery prompted an investigation into alternative BF neuron types. Our preliminary
studies suggest that BF-PV neurons have key attributes relevant for sustained attention: their activity
predicts detection accuracy and reaction time on a trial-by-trial basis, and their optogenetic stimulation
enhances performance.
Using quantitative behavior, cell-type-specific recordings and manipulations, viral tracing, and
computational modeling, we aim to explore the link between BF-PV neurons and sustained attention.
Aim 1 will map BF-PV cortical projections and investigate whether they produce cortical gain control
through disinhibition. Aim 2 will record BF-PV neuron activity to assess how its dynamics predict
momentary attention levels during sustained attention tasks and use optogenetics to evaluate their
necessity and sufficiency. Aim 3 seeks to determine if BF-PV neurons convey motivational salience
signals that guide attention allocation.
This work will elucidate how long-range, cortex-projecting BF-PV neurons support sustained attention,
distinguishing their contributions from known cholinergic effects. Defining the computations and
connectivity underlying sustained attention will provide fundamental insights into basal forebrain circuits
for normal cognition. Illuminating this poorly understood pathway may also reveal new therapeutic
targets for attention disorders and BF-related dementias like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease."

 Despite major advances in risk stratification and clinical management, the field of lung transplantation
continues to experience persistently high waitlist mortality, increased peri-operative complications, and post-
transplant disability, with nearly 1/3 patients dying within 3-years. The NHLBI has deemed the need for
interventions to target causes for these poor outcomes as a priority to advancing the field. Over the last decade,
our team has shown that physical frailty is present in up to 1/3 of lung transplant candidates and is associated
with markedly increased risk for disability, poorer health-related quality of life, and death both before and after
lung transplantation. Screening for frailty is now recommended as part of clinical lung transplant candidacy
evaluations. Once frailty is identified, however, there are no empirically supported treatments to address it.
 Although the causes of frailty are multifactorial, exercise and lifestyle modification remain gold-standard
frailty treatments as they target key consensus mechanisms of frailty. In observational work, we showed that key
mechanisms of frailty—and treatable by lifestyle interventions—such as sarcopenia, adiposity, systemic
inflammation, and low physical activity are associated with frailty in lung transplant candidates. With this as
background, we partnered with experts in geriatrics, PR, and exercise physiology to adapt frailty interventions
designed for community-dwelling older adults to lung transplant. In two remotely-delivered pilot interventions, we
showed that frailty can be treated in small groups of highly selected lung transplant candidates and recipients.
 We are now poised to scale our remotely-delivered intervention program to treat frail lung transplant
candidates. Our Exercise-based Frailty Intervention in Lung Transplantation (XFIT) program is an 8-week
telehealth-delivered exercise-focused intervention. It integrates theoretical frameworks of behavior change to
engage participants in program of “pre-habilitation”. During the R61 milestone-driven development and
preparation phase, we will complete trainings, patient-facing materials, finalize the XFIT protocol, recruit a
DSMB, and obtain regulatory approvals. During the R33 intervention phase, we will randomize 70 patients who
reflect the diversity and spectrum of illness seen in the general lung transplant candidate population to either
XFIT or enhanced standard of care. An interventionalist with expertise in exercise physiology and remote
interventions will deliver 8 weekly sessions using video-conference software in participants’ homes. These
sessions feature one-on-one exercise training and targeting of behavioral barriers to optimizing physical activity
using motivational interviewing principles. Establishing safety is our primary outcome. We will secondarily
establish feasibility and acceptability, and explore responsiveness six-minute walk distance, frailty, PROs . We
anticipate that this first-of-its kind study in solid organ transplantation will establish fundamental safety, feasibility,
and accessibility data needed inform larger scale interventions. XFIT directly addresses NHLBI, solid-organ
transplant, and respiratory society calls for frailty interventions."

Our understanding of the biology of neuropsychiatric disease is still in the early stages. Genome-wide association
studies have identified multiple genomic loci associated with such diseases, but the biology of many of those
targets is still unknown. In this proposal, we focus on the LRRC57 gene, which was identified among the top
targets for bipolar disorder, a devastating psychiatric condition that affects millions of people around the world
and is characterized by extreme mood swings, ranging from mania to depressive episodes, each of which can
last for several days. The Lrrc57 gene encodes a 27-kDa horseshoe-shaped protein that belongs to the Leucine-
Rich Repeat domain–Containing proteins and is evolutionarily conserved. LRRC57 is expressed in neurons, and
its germline deletion is lethal in flies and worms. Despite its importance, no studies on the biology of LRRC57
have been reported in the literature. Our preliminary data show that germline Lrrc57 deletion is also lethal in
mice. Furthermore, we determined that the LRRC57 protein mediates the function of neurotrophic growth factors,
which are important for neural development, synaptic plasticity, and cognition. In preparation of this proposal, we
have produced a specific monoclonal anti-LRRC57 antibody and genetically engineered mice with global Lrrc57
deletion, mice with the conditional deletion of Lrrc57 in neurons only, and mice with the conditional
overexpression of Lrrc57 in neurons at different developmental stages. Using these tools, we propose to
elucidate the biochemical functions of LRRC57 by identifying its interacting protein partners, determining the
functional importance of those interactions, and establishing the molecular profile of the mouse brain upon Lrrc57
deletion or overexpression (Aim 1). We also propose to investigate the role of LRRC57 in neural excitability,
synaptic transmission, and long-term synaptic plasticity, with a focus on neurotrophin-dependent forms of
synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus (Aim 2). In this Aim, we will also test cognitive function and bipolar
disorder–related behaviors in mice with conditionally deleted or overexpressed Lrrc57. This work will establish
the foundation for gaining an understanding of the biology of the previously unrecognized, evolutionarily
conserved Lrrc57 gene and potentially reveal its involvement in bipolar disorder."

Motivation: This is a successor application of our successful project, Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI, R01
EB009690. MRI offers superb soft tissue contrast for children, without the ionizing radiation and cancer risk
of CT. However, MRI use has been limited due to long exams, low spatial resolution, and motion-artifacts. Thus,
MRI often requires prolonged anesthesia with breath-holds and attendant risk; hence, children often are denied
the beneﬁts of cross-sectional imaging altogether or are exposed to ionizing radiation.
The previous project addressed these concerns by creating a dedicated pediatric imaging system. Highly parallel,
high-SNR 3T receive coil arrays were developed speciﬁcally for pediatric body imaging. The high SNR was used
to accelerate scans reconstructed with parallel imaging, new motion correction algorithms, Compressed Sensing
(CS), and higher-dimensional non-Cartesian scanning. This system is now being used extensively in clinical
practice, signiﬁcantly reducing anesthesia depth and duration, and has markedly increased our MRI utilization.
Key technologies have been or are now being commercialized with GE Healthcare, including the pediatric receive
array, CS, dynamic contrast enhancement, 4D ﬂow, full-Fourier single-shot T2-weighted scanning, coil compres-
sion, and Deep Learning (DL) based image reconstruction. Siemens has licensed 21 of our patents, implemented
some of them in work-in-progress packages, and productized our coil compression and our ESPIRiT coil sensi-
tivity estimation. Philips has licensed six of our patents. This ensures broad impact.
Despite this signiﬁcant progress a substantial number of exams still require anesthesia due to patient discomfort.
This proposal focuses on one such common study, diagnosing Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Current MRI
techniques require glucagon to stop bowel motion, and this produces pain, nausea, and vomiting. Intravenous
gadolinium contrast is also required. Our goal in this project is to develop advanced MRI techniques which obviate
the need for glucagon and IV gadolinium. This will allow more patients to be studied, eliminate anesthesia, and
dramatically improve their MRI experience. The developed core technologies will impact other MRI exams as well.
Approach: The project has three development aims, validated by a fourth aim of clinical studies. Aim 1 will
enable fast dynamic 2D imaging at higher spatial and temporal resolutions. Aim 2 will develop free-breathing 3D
contrast-enhanced imaging that can resolve moving bowel, eliminating the need for intravenous glucagon. Aim 3
will enable high resolution motion-robust non-contrast characterization of the bowel wall, eliminating the need for
intravenous gadolinium. The impact of all of these developments will be assessed in children with IBD.
Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to fast, robust, broadly-applicable pediatric MRI protocols with less anesthe-
sia, making MRI safer, cheaper, and more available to children. MRI will be transformed into a workhorse modality
for IBD, improving their care and reducing CT radiation burden. The techniques will also facilitate wide application
of MRI to new applications, for both pediatric and adult diseases."

 Human patients who lose limbs due to injury or disease are faced with profound challenges for the rest
of their lives. Prostheses, while increasingly sophisticated, lack key functionalities, and amputees report
dissatisfaction with current prosthetic options. A long-term goal of regenerative medicine is to develop
therapeutic limb regeneration strategies. Yet, this goal remains in the distant future because of a fundamental
lack of scientific understanding of how to stimulate and guide a patient’s own cells to create a new limb. Animal
models are likely to be key in building this missing foundation in scientific understanding of how to regenerate a
limb. While mice offer many advantages in genetic studies, they are extremely limited in their limb regeneration
abilities—like humans, mice are only naturally capable of regenerating the extreme distal tip of their digits. Full,
natural limb regeneration has not been reported in any mammal to date. Frogs can naturally regenerate full
limbs but only as tadpoles before development is complete. In contrast, many (if not all) salamander species
studied to date can regenerate full limbs following amputation throughout life. Salamander limbs are
remarkably similar in tissue composition and anatomy to human limbs. Thus, salamanders are ideal models for
elucidating the fundamental biological processes required to regenerate limbs. Among salamanders, axolotls
have emerged as a premier model because many genetic and experimental tools have now been developed
for axolotl. An important missing piece of the overall puzzle is how stem cells are specified to form during
axolotl embryological development and how these relate to the axolotl’s ability to regenerate limbs later in life.
 Here, we propose to use modern molecular genetic tools to build a map of transcriptional control of
axolotl embryogenesis with single-cell resolution. This resource will enable us to identify the origin and nature
of stem cells in axolotl embryos, and it will enable other researchers to develop hypotheses about other cell
types as well. We will identify stem cells as they arise during development, along with the key transcripts that
distinguish these cells from other cells, which will be essential for future studies, including those directed at
understanding how limb regeneration may use stem cells. In parallel, in a complementary strategy, we will
interrogate the embryological origins of 8 putative fibroblast stem cell types we recently isolated from axolotl
limbs and demonstrated become activated to proliferate by amputation. We will extend this analysis to
developing limbs. This work is essential for understanding the contribution of stem cells to the diverse tissues
of the regenerate limb. It will also pave the way to experimentally manipulate specific stem cell populations in
future studies in order to rigorously define their activities and the factors they use to execute these functions."

Rodent animal models are key to understanding the fundamental biological mechanism and to advancing
clinically relevant testing, including aging and age-related diseases. Intimately linked to temperature, total
energy expenditure (TEE) is an important concept to understand how the weight-reduced organismal state
improves metabolism or how physical activity affects energy expenditure. Intriguingly, an age-related increase
in the energetic cost of physical activity in mice and age-related changes in physical activity energy
expenditure (PAEE) in humans suggest the utility of these metrics as biomarkers of aging. We propose to
determine age-related changes in PAEE and/or other TEE constituents and their utility as physiological
biomarkers of aging. Classical metabolic cages record only one mouse per cage, limiting the study of social
behaviors, and commercial activity monitoring platforms do not offer continuous thermal imaging, are very
expensive, and require dedicated facilities and personnel. To address these shortcomings, we are developing
a comprehensive platform for enduring thermal imaging in a controlled environment (ENTICE). Based on
conventional home cages, ENTICE has thermal and far-red cameras, a controlled food dispenser, an in-cage
mouse weighing platform, and a volunteer running wheel with direct recording of energy generated by an
animal. Thermal and far-red mages are analyzed on the fly, enabling real-time analysis of animal behaviors.
Here, we propose to longitudinally record and analyze groups of young, middle-aged, and old mice to
determine age-related changes in PAEE and/or other constituent parts of TEE and to uncover common
determinants and individual aspects (heterogeneity) of mouse aging. To enable the study of the social aspect
of aging, we will develop a deep thermal identification (DeepT-ID) model that combines deep learning neural
networks with classical image texture features for rapid and robust thermal image analysis and mouse
identification that enable distinguishing, simultaneous tracking, and analysis of several animals in the same
cage. ENTICE represents a compact, affordable (under 10K USD) platform that could be installed and
operated in an individual laboratory. We provide a comprehensive assembly tutorial and a user-friendly
Python-based software package to make behavioral studies accessible to all investigators working with mice.
We believe that the development and validation of this novel thermal imaging-based scalable, cost-effective
platform will have a significant impact, enabling the testing of candidate drugs and interventions in various
mouse models of aging and age-related diseases and capturing comprehensive behavioral and physiological
phenotypes."

The objective is to demonstrate feasibility of LQUS in human patients for assessing the severity of pulmonary
edema due to heart failure and of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The long-term goal is to develop LQUS to monitor
pulmonary edema and fibrosis with high sensitivity and specificity in real time, in vivo, in humans.
In patients with lung diseases such as pulmonary edema or fibrosis, diagnosis and monitoring is done using
chest X-ray and CT scanning, or invasive pulmonary function tests. However, these imaging modalities expose
patients to ionizing radiation, have high inter-observer variability, and are expensive and impractical for frequent
routine monitoring. Pulmonary function tests are effort dependent and coughing and shortness of breath may
affect the results. Therefore, the need for an in-vivo, point-of-care, real-time, non-ionizing, and noninvasive
quantitative monitoring of pulmonary edema is great.
Conventional ultrasound remains challenging in the lung because the air-filled alveoli cause multiple scattering.
Vertical artifacts called B-lines can be observed with various lung diseases. Although they have some diagnostic
relevance, these artifacts are operator- and system-dependent. More critically, they are qualitative and not
specific. A need exists for the development of QUS biomarkers of the lung, to monitor chronic conditions leading
to interstitial lung diseases such as cardiogenic pulmonary edema and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. We propose
to develop new LQUS-based metrics of the lung parenchyma. We will develop methods to mitigate chest-wall
effects and optimize the data acquisition for humans (Aim1), and apply LQUS methods in-vivo in humans with
HF (Aim2) and with pulmonary fibrosis (Aim3)."
10946247,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the third leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States. The vast majority of
PC are pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The etiology of PDAC is not fully understood. Basic research
supports a crucial role of certain proteins in PDAC development. Epidemiological studies also have identified
multiple candidate protein biomarkers for PDAC. However, findings with many of these protein biomarkers have
been inconsistent, potentially due to major methodological limitations, such as selection bias and uncontrolled
confounding. Besides understanding etiology, identifying causal protein biomarkers can potentially contribute to
improving risk prediction. For PC, substantial efforts have been made to identify high-risk populations for
improving PC screening. However, the performance of available PC risk prediction models remains
unsatisfactory. There are critical needs to 1) apply a novel study design with reduced limitations of conventional
biomarker studies for characterizing PC causally related protein biomarkers to improve the etiology
understanding; and 2) develop improved prediction models that may effectively facilitate PC risk assessment.
One strategy to potentially decrease limitations of unmeasured confounding is to use genetic instruments for
assessing the relationship between proteins and PDAC. While our previous studies have utilized proteins
measured in blood, it is also critical to study pancreatic ductal tissue, the most relevant tissue for PDAC
development, as levels of many proteins show tissue-specific effects. The proposed project will apply a series of
new studies to address these important knowledge gaps. Specifically, we will 1) conduct a study to identify
putative causal protein biomarkers for PDAC risk by applying novel methods (Aim 1); 2) functionally characterize
top protein biomarkers for their roles in PC biology (Aim 2); and 3) develop and validate prediction models for
PC risk, by incorporating newly identified candidate protein biomarkers and integrating results from multiple
statistical methods (Aim 3). Given the strong pilot data, unique resources, and our team's extensive expertise
and experience, we are uniquely positioned to conduct this project. Our study will generate important new
knowledge for PC etiology, and develop improved PC risk prediction models."

Clinical predictors are now firmly incorporated into routine standard-of-care in many fields of medicine, in contrast
with Psychiatry where quantitative predictors that guide clinical decision-making remain extremely
limited. Psychosis-related disorders are responsible for a substantial public health burden, for which there are
significant unmet needs that would be subserved by clinical predictors. For example, long-term outcomes vary
widely and identifying individuals with poor or advantageous future outcomes would help to optimize treatment
planning and resource allocation. Furthermore, antipsychotics are associated with adverse side effects, such as
increased risk of diabetes. In this application, we propose to use machine learning approaches to build predictors
and identify subtypes of clinical outcomes among individuals with schizophrenia, through integration of
longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), dimensional phenotyping, and genetic analyses. We will also
explore the psychosocial and ethical implications of psychiatric clinical predictors. Our long-term objective is to
advance the goals of Precision Psychiatry to achieve individualized treatment planning, outcome monitoring, and
preventive interventions. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Leverage two independent EHR
databases for outcome prediction and sub-classification of psychosis-related disorders. (a) We will use
the longitudinal PSYCKES and MarketScan databases to build machine learning-based individual-level
prediction models to forecast the onset of four major prognostic outcomes: treatment response (antipsychotic
resistance), illness severity (long-term hospitalization), medical comorbidity (diabetes), and diagnostic transition
from a psychosis-related disorder to schizophrenia. (b) We will perform cohort-level analyses using unsupervised
methods to discover novel psychosis-related diagnosis and prognosis subtypes. Aim 2: Enhance predictive
modeling through dimensional phenotyping and whole genome sequencing. (a) We will recruit n = 10,000
patients with schizophrenia from the PSYCKES database population for enriched data collection: 1) dimensional
phenotyping (cognition, exposome, and social determinants of health), and 2) whole genome sequencing to
enable calling of rare variants, structural variants, and common variants (polygenic risk). (b) We will investigate
the extent to which dimensional phenotypes and genomic data can improve the models developed in Aim 1. Aim
3: Explore the psychosocial and ethical implications of psychiatric clinical predictors. (a) We will survey
a subset of patients and their clinicians regarding their attitudes towards implementation of clinical outcome
predictors. (b) We will return pathogenic findings to patients through genetic counseling and survey the
experience of patients and their clinicians on their emotional reactions and perceptions of impairment, treatability,
and life-planning."

Globally, about 20 million infants are born with low birthweight (LBW), and these infants face a myriad of health
challenges, including difficulties in regulating body temperature, poor nutritional outcomes, increased
vulnerability to infections, and delayed development, placing emotional and financial burdens on families.
Kangaroo Care (KC), consisting of continuous skin-to-skin contact, exclusive breastfeeding, and early discharge,
is an evidence-based intervention recommended for LBW newborns to improve their survival and healthy
development, especially in low-resource settings where the risks of prematurity, neonatal hypothermia, and
neonatal mortality are disproportionately high. Despite the effectiveness of KC, widespread scale-up has been
slow due to barriers to implementation and adoption. Existing efforts have primarily focused on health systems
and policy changes, neglecting the need to support mothers and families to continue practicing KC at home.
Several sociocultural and economic factors, including lack of essential warmth-related items, cultural norms,
stigma, and limited social support, hinder the KC continuation at home. To address these challenges, we have
developed an intervention grounded in the Information, Motivation, and Behavior (IMB) model. The intervention
offers emotional, informational, and motivational peer support to mothers of LBW infants and a kit containing
low-cost, locally sourced neonatal care items to facilitate skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding. Guided by the
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,
Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework, we will conduct a type II hybrid effectiveness-
implementation study. First, we test the effectiveness of our intervention using an individual randomized
controlled trial, enrolling 328 mother-infant dyads eligible for KC from two tertiary hospitals in Ghana (Aim 1). We
hypothesize that mothers receiving the intervention will be more likely to continue KC at home 7 days after
discharge compared to those in the control group receiving the standard of care. Our primary effectiveness
outcome is any duration of skin-to-skin contact and exclusive breastfeeding at 7 days post-discharge. Second,
we will explore the implementation process including associated barriers and facilitators to implementation, using
mixed methods (Aim 2). In-depth interviews will be conducted with participants, peer supporters and healthcare
workers. Thematic analysis of the interviews will be guided by the CFIR framework and combine both inductive
and deductive approaches. Findings from this research will inform the development of effective models for KC
implementation and scale-up."

Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus, GBS) is an asymptomatic colonizer of the genital and
gastrointestinal tracts of healthy people, however, it can become a major cause of disease especially in
immunocompromised individuals and the neonate. GBS is the leading cause of neonatal meningitis and
presently there is no vaccine available. Therefore, there is much interest in discovering how GBS is able to
colonize a healthy host, interact with other microbes in the mucosa, and cause invasive disease. For years,
researchers have relied on non-targeted mutagenesis strategies such as transposon mutagenesis to discover
novel GBS virulence factors. However, these strategies have the potential to miss the impact of essential
genes, can be prone to “hotspots”, and are not ordered. Recently, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)
technologies have enabled researchers to investigate the contribution of any gene of interest rapidly by
generating a targeted knockdown. The aim of this proposal is to generate an ordered CRISPRi library in the
hypervirulent strain of GBS, COH1 (Type III, MLST-17). First, we will generate a deactivated Cas9 mutant in
GBS that is required for CRISPRi. Next, we will generate two-fold coverage knockdowns of each gene in the
GBS COH1 genome, index, and cryopreserve. The generated library will be made available to the wider GBS
community and can be utilized to investigate aspects of GBS colonization and pathogenesis such as host-
pathogen interactions, GBS colonization of gut and genital tract mucosal environments, microbe-microbe
interactions, immune evasion, and many more. Additionally, the library will be thoughtfully designed so that
guide RNA constructs, where applicable, will be effective in other commonly used laboratory strains of GBS.
Therefore our proposed library will provide not only the COH1 knockdown library to the field, but also a library
of guide RNA knockdown constructs amenable to the wider GBS community. Using the CRISPRi library, we
anticipate to propel the GBS field forward that could uncover novel interactions between the host and pathogen
that could lead to therapeutic interventions."
10951892,"A unifying pathology of age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD),
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Huntington’s disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the
accumulation of misfolded proteins and protein aggregates in the nervous system. Paradoxically, aggregation-
prone proteins are expressed in both neurons and astrocytes, yet neurons appear more vulnerable to the
accumulation of protein aggregates. These observations suggest cell-type-specific differences in how quality
control pathways are managed in neurons and astrocytes to regulate the integrity of the proteome. In fact, we
have found striking differences in how the autophagy-lysosomal pathway and the ubiquitin-proteasome system
are managed between neurons and astrocytes. Despite this knowledge, a comprehensive understanding of
the cell-type-specific pathways for regulating proteostasis in neurons versus astrocytes has not been
achieved. Moreover, the relationship between neurons and astrocytes in the context of proteotoxic
stress is largely unknown. It is well established that astrocytes play critical roles in neuronal homeostasis,
function, and neuroprotection. By contrast, astrocytes are also emerging as key players in disease
pathogenesis. However, we are only at the inception of understanding the molecular and functional properties
of neuron-astrocyte interactions in health and disease. Thus, this proposal will define the regulation of
lysosome-mediated pathways (autophagy and endolysosomal) within (Aim 1) and between (Aim 2)
astrocytes and neurons in response to proteotoxic stress elicited by fibrillar forms of a-synuclein, a
model for a-synucleinopathies including PD. To elucidate cell-type-specific responses, we developed a
robust system to coculture primary neurons and astrocytes that recapitulates morphological, proteomic, and
functional signatures of astrocytes in vivo. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that autophagy
and lysosomal pathways are adapted differently in astrocytes versus neurons, which may render
neurons preferentially vulnerable to proteotoxic stress associated with a-synuclein aggregation. To
test this hypothesis, we will (1) define the sequence of degradation of a-synuclein fibrils via lysosome-
mediated pathways within astrocytes as compared with neurons, and (2) define the role of the autophagy
receptor TAX1BP1 in the coupling of neuron-astrocyte stress responses to a-synuclein proteotoxins. We
employ live-cell imaging combined with quantitative cell biology and biochemistry to investigate these
processes at high spatiotemporal resolution in a compartment-specific manner. These studies will reveal new
concepts in how quality control pathways are managed in the neuron-astrocyte unit in response to proteotoxic
stress. This information will also inform cell-type-specific vulnerabilities in neurodegenerative disease and
enable more specific strategies to mitigate neuronal dysfunction and death."

This is a new application by an early-stage investigator with a long-term career objective of transforming
cardiovascular care using artificial intelligence and data science. The proposal focuses on aortic stenosis (AS),
a progressive narrowing of the aortic valve, which manifests in older adults and causes significant disability and
premature mortality despite minimally invasive treatment strategies. AS is either diagnosed following symptom-
driven diagnostic testing or incidentally discovered, which has simultaneously led to a vast underdiagnosis of
advanced stages of AS while identifying many with early-stage aortic valve disease without clarity on appropriate
follow-up. There is a critical need for novel screening and prognostication strategies for AS. We show that artificial
intelligence (AI) models applied to 1-lead electrocardiograms (AI-ECGs) can be a sensitive and convenient
screen for advanced (moderate/severe) AS. AI-ECG can be paired with a second, more specific, AI-enhanced
handheld cardiac point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). This AI-POCUS automates the diagnosis of advanced AS
without specialized imaging or expert evaluation. In Aim 1, we propose a multicenter pragmatic RCT evaluating
this 2-stage, AI-driven screening strategy for advanced AS. This innovative, technology-driven screening strategy
will define a new paradigm for the efficient identification of advanced AS. In addition, we evaluate a novel strategy
to bridge the critical gap in precision follow-up, especially for early-stage aortic valve disease. Early aortic valve
disease – aortic sclerosis or mild AS – affects nearly a fourth of older adults over 65 years. However, there are
no guideline recommendations on follow-up for aortic sclerosis, and recommendations for mild AS do not account
for the substantial heterogeneity in disease progression. In our preliminary investigations from a multicenter
observational cohort study, we show that a deep learning tool for echocardiographic videos – deep learning-
based aortic stenosis severity index (DASSi) – can define those at substantially elevated risk of progression to
advanced AS and adverse clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, we will conduct a multicenter, prospective evaluation of
an individualized AS progression score among older adults with aortic sclerosis or mild AS through a protocolized
Doppler echocardiogram to distinguish those with high and low rates of progression. The investigations in Aim 2
will establish the reliability of a digital biomarker for AS progression that can enable precision care and follow-
up. The work is supported by the team’s broad expertise in (a) clinical medicine, including cardiology, geriatrics,
and imaging; (b) technology, spanning informatics, data science, and AI; and (c) clinical trials, with experience in
designing and executing studies. The evidence generated from a multicenter evaluation of low-cost AI-driven
interventions can be immediately adopted and scaled to have a major public health impact. Moreover, an
objective approach to the diagnosis and follow-up of AS will reduce healthcare disparities for vulnerable patients.
Future work will build on these results and engage directly with communities using low-cost portable devices to
improve disease detection and outcomes among those without adequate healthcare access."

 Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) remains a significant and incurable health problem that will become more
prevalent as life expectancy increases. Despite the introduction of steroid 5α-reductase inhibitors (5ARI) through
inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to manage BPH and associated lower
urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), progression of LUTS was only slowed by 34% with 5ARI-response. Therefore,
the utilization of 5ARI remains ineffective in many patients, leading to the use of invasive therapies. Here we
propose to study the mechanisms of non-responsiveness to 5ARI.
 Ongoing work in our lab has focused on steroid 5α-reductase 2 (SRD5A2), the enzyme responsible for
prostatic development and growth. We have revealed that the expression of SRD5A2 is variable; in fact, 30%
of men do not express SRD5A2 in prostate tissues. Our studies indicate that the epigenetic silencing of
SRD5A2 promotes an androgenic-to-estrogenic switch in epithelial cell transcriptional regulation. To
investigate the underlying mechanism of prostate cells’ response to the restriction of DHT when SRD5A2 is
low, we generated SRD5A2 null (SRD5A2-/-) mice. With single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq), we
discovered a discrete subpopulation of luminal epithelial-2 (LE2) cells from the anterior prostate that has
increased expression of estrogen receptor α (ERα, ESR1) and PKCα in the absence of SRD5A2. This subset
may represent the emergence of an androgen-independent phenotype. Therefore, we hypothesize that
ESR1+/PKCα+ LE2 cells acquire enhanced survival potential in the absence of SRD5A2, leading to
androgen-independent prostatic survival. To identify the signaling that maintains LE2 cell and prostate
survival upon DHT restriction, we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1 will elucidate that LE2 cells are
the significant cell population resistant to SRD5A2 suppression. Aim 2 will define ER signaling that sustains
the survival of LE2 cells in the absence of SRD5A2. Aim 3 will determine LE2 cells and ER signaling in the
human prostate and their responsiveness to 5ARI therapy. Our findings have broad implications for using 5ARI
for BPH management and may open new avenues for developing novel and alternate therapies."

Tandem repeats are a prevalent class of genomic variant, prone to high frequency of mutation and known to
underlay some neurological disorders, including the trinucleotide repeat disorders, Huntington’s Disease and
spinocerebellar ataxias. To date, a systematic investigation of the role of TRs in schizophrenia has not yet been
conducted, partly owing to technical limitations in genotyping tandem repeats, as well as lack of access to large-
scale, sequenced schizophrenia cohorts.
The goal of the current project is to apply recently developed TR profiling tools to whole genome sequenced
(WGS), schizophrenia cohorts to identify variation in short tandem repeats (STRs) and variable number tandem
repeats (VNTRs), that may contribute to schizophrenia genetic risk.
The proposed systematic study of TR variation in schizophrenia has a high likelihood of uncovering novel genetic
risk factors. The study will leverage innovative algorithms for high-throughput TR genotyping applied to large
and well-powered schizophrenia cohorts. Therefore, this timely and well-powered approach could lead to novel
insights into the role of tandem repeat variation in schizophrenia and human disease, with important translational
implications."

New targets to combat Pseudomonas aeruginosa is paramount given the difficulty of treating
Pseudomonas infections and increasing drug resistance of this pathogen. A major goal has been
to target the type III secretion system that directly delivers toxins into host cells. However, this
has yet to result in a clinical therapeutic. We recently discovered an unannotated regulator,
PA1627, that controls expression of the type III secretion system. In this proposal, we will
determine the regulation of PA1627 and determine how PA1627 controls the type III secretion
system. Understanding this new level of control of the type III secretion can lead to new
possibilities for combatting P. aeruginosa."

Protein kinases function in cell signaling through regulated phosphorylation of specific substrates. Current
methods allow one to comprehensively identify the substrates of a given kinase, yet we lack general methodology
for determining which substrates are critical for specific functions of that kinase. Likewise, approaches for probing
the functional impact that phosphorylation has upon such key substrates are lacking. Here, we propose to
develop technology allowing for directed phosphorylation of a single protein kinase substrate at defined sites.
With this approach, we engineer a kinase mutant that can only phosphorylate a designer allele of one of its
substrates. To accomplish this goal we will leverage knowledge of kinase phosphorylation site specificity gained
through our recent comprehensive analysis of the human serine-threonine kinome and consequent
understanding of the structural determinants of kinase selectivity. We will establish the feasibility of this
technology using the tumor suppressor kinase LKB1 as a model system. LKB1 has a well-defined substrate
repertoire, phosphorylating and activating a set of 14 downstream protein serine-threonine kinases exclusively
on Thr residues. We will engineer LKB1 so that it instead phosphorylates Ser residues and does not act on its
endogenous substrates. We will then engineer compensating mutations in one of its key substrates, the AMP-
activated protein kinase (AMPK), to restore phosphorylation and activation by mutant LKB1. Human cancer cell
lines co-expressing these alleles will be analyzed for LKB1-dependent activation of AMPK to the exclusion of
other LKB1 substrates. To determine whether this system faithfully recapitulates endogenous signaling, we will
examine phosphorylation of established substrates downstream of AMPK, and we will globally map changes to
the phosphoproteome in response to AMPK activation. At the outcome of these studies, we will have established
a system in which a single substrate of a kinase is phosphorylated with identical dynamics as the native
substrate. Future studies will expand this approach into other LKB1 substrates, facilitating studies of how LKB1
functions as a tumor suppressor. We will ultimately apply this technology generally to other protein kinases
implicated in cancer whose critical substrates are currently unknown."
10946495,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an exquisitely painful, life-threatening, public health problem
that has substantial morbidity and limited treatment modalities. Our long-term goal is to develop focused
therapies to treat AP and mitigate disease severity. The premise is based on our discovery (1) that the
calcium-activated phosphatase calcineurin (CN) is a potent mediator of AP in the primary parenchymal cell of
the pancreas, the acinar cell, and (2) that the distinct molecular signatures underlying this potent effect can be
leveraged to develop targeted therapies for AP. The two major objectives of the current proposal are (1) to
elucidate the CN-modulated signaling pathways in AP and (2) to identify novel and potentially therapeutically
targetable, direct CN substrates within these pathways. The three Specific Aims are to: (1) Define the
phosphosignaling networks, including signatures regulated by CN activity in AP through phosphoproteomics
coupled with powerful bioinformatics; (2) characterize the role of CN in the identified pathways of mTOR and
autophagy during AP; and (3) evaluate novel CN substrate candidates that are integral to the identified
pathways. Our hypothesis, which was generated from compelling preliminary phosphoproteomic data, is that
CN mediates AP by impairing autophagy, and the mechanism for the impairment is through both (1) activation
of the upstream autophagy inhibitor mTOR and (2) direct inhibition of CN substrates in the autophagy pathway
itself. The design of the approach is that Aim 1 is an unbiased phosphoproteomic screen, using clinically and
biologically relevant AP conditions, for phosphosignals that will provide clues to CN-modulated pathways in
AP. Aim 2 is to conduct independent, empirical testing of CN modulation in AP of the identified pathways of
autophagy and mTOR, by examining canonical components and phosphosites, including the ones that were
not necessarily detected in the unbiased phosphoproteomic data. Aim 3 is a systematic identification, followed
by biochemical validation, of novel CN substrates that are integral to the identified pathways in AP. Here, we
will also probe the molecular mechanisms by which CN modulates novel substrate activity and function.
Incorporating a highly multidisciplinary team of investigators and an ideally suited environment, the proposed
studies are technologically and conceptually innovative since they utilize (1) advanced computational methods
to identify CN-regulated pathways and substrates, (2) human pancreas specimens for ex vivo culture, (3) an
innovative in vivo pressure-induced pancreatitis (PIP) model, and (4) cutting edge phosphoproteomic and
biochemical tools including BioID, which captures in cell transient low-affinity interactions between CN and its
substrate candidates. The significance of the proposal is that it creates a discovery pipeline to identify novel
CN-modulated phosphosignaling networks in AP and will provide a valuable resource to the pancreas
community that will aid in devising targeted AP therapies."

Texts describing medical advances are of keen interest to the general public. However, reliable
medical evidence is largely disseminated in peer-reviewed journal articles describing new
ﬁndings. Because such articles are wrięen in technical language intended for experts, this
“primary literature” is eﬀectively inaccessible to the general population. With very large
language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT now widely available, lay people are increasingly
turning to them for medical information. One potentially promising use is for LLMs to provide
simpliﬁed versions of medical papers. However, while LLMs can capably simplify texts
automatically, they can also still generate inaccurate, unsupported, and/or potentially
misleading information, posing a risk.
This proposal seeks to develop novel natural language processing (NLP) technologies to
mitigate risks and improve the reliability of LLM outputs for the task of medical text
simpliﬁcation. Given the high-stakes of healthcare information, we focus on building
controllable, transparent LLMs that are moderately sized, and design tools that enable
communities to strike a balance between using LLMs safely and perceiving their outputs
critically, while (potentially) improving health literacy by eventually empowering the public
with more reliable access to high-quality, newly published medical ﬁndings.
We propose several methodological safeguards. To begin, we will design the ﬁrst error
detection model for LLM-generated simpliﬁcations of medical texts, trained with
expert-annotated data focusing on factual correctness. This tool will then allow us to build safer
knowledge distillation methods, i.e., training much more eﬃcient, smaller models on examples
elicited from massive, closed models like GPT-4 calibrated by estimated conﬁdence of their
correctness. With full access to the parameters of the distilled model, we propose innovative
ways to improve the factuality and readability of the output, and to estimate the model’s
(un)certainty of its own output. We will then integrate these safety guards into a prototype,
such that they can be evaluated by medical experts and lay readers."

One of the unfortunate effects of aging is the loss of muscle mass, strength, and function, termed “sarcopenia”,
when it is not associated with an underlying disease. Sarcopenia affects 40-50% of individuals over 80 years of
age, and is a major contributor to physical disability, poor quality of life, and death among the elderly. The
molecular mechanisms responsible for sarcopenia are not well-understood. In aged muscle, myosin undergoes
chemical modifications that correlate with alterations in its structure and diminished contractile function. Guided
by our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that aging leads to altered myosin-chaperone interactions, as a result
of chemical modifications of these proteins that accumulate with age, ultimately contributing to the diminished
muscle mass of sarcopenia. Through a unique collaboration between two expert research labs, we will test this
hypothesis using a novel combination of in vitro biochemical and biophysical assays and in vivo techniques to
probe the effects of post-translational modifications on the UNC-45/Hsp90/myosin system during aging. Our
preliminary data show that during aging of adult C. elegans there is a time-dependent decrease in the steady
state levels of these proteins: first HSP-90, then UNC-45 and then myosin. During aging, we also observe a loss
of UNC-45 that is correlated with an increase in phosphorylation of the protein: we have identified several sites
of age-associated PTMs, including a phospho-serine in the HSP-90 binding TPR repeats (S111) and
phosphorylation of two conserved serines in the chaperoning domain of UNC-45 (S659 and S723). Based on
our preliminary data, we hypothesize that an important mechanism of sarcopenia is age-associated
chemical modifications of UNC-45 and myosin that reduce the stability and/or function of these crucial
muscle proteins. In this project, we will use a novel combination of biophysical and in vivo tools to test this
hypothesis at multiple scales (protein to myofibril to cell to animal). In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that
age-dependent PTMs of UNC-45 reduce its stability and/or chaperone function, thus reducing the ability of UNC-
45 to refold damaged myosin. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that age-dependent PTMs of myosin alter its
stability and/or motor activity. By creating C. elegans mutants in which residues that normally undergo post-
translational modification cannot be modified, we will test the hypothesis that such changes will result in delayed
or reduced sarcopenia. C. elegans has provided valuable insights, translatable to all animals, on myofibril
assembly and maintenance, genes responsible for longevity and aging, and is an established model for studying
sarcopenia. Our hypotheses, if confirmed, will represent a new paradigm in the biology of sarcopenia, with
potential for novel therapeutic approaches, using rational drug design to target different specific enzymes (e.g.,
protein kinases) to prevent aging-associated chemical modifications of myosin and UNC-45, and hence delaying
the onset or reducing the severity of sarcopenia in the elderly."

 White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are an important factor in the occurrence and progression of stroke,
cognitive decline, and dementia in the aging population, but pose a puzzling challenge in evaluations of
brain health and disease due to its underlying pathologic heterogeneity. While WMH are frequently
considered as a consequence of cerebral small-vessel disease (CSVD), emerging evidence suggest WMH
may also arise from non-vascular processes including Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related neurodegeneration
or neuroinflammation. Understanding the multifactorial etiologies of WMH is critical for development of much
needed therapies and preventative strategies, especially given its high prevalence in older community
persons. However, commonly used assessment methods based on global severity burden fail to address
such heterogeneity. WMH spatial patterns is a novel phenotype that can be extracted from structural MRI
data using advanced pattern analysis methods that capitalizes on variability in WMH topography across
different diseases. We previously show that machine learning (ML)-derived spatial patterns of WMH more
precisely capture the underlying heterogeneity in WMH pathology compared to standard region or lobar-
based classifications. Distinct ML-derived WMH spatial patterns have unique associations with different
WMH etiologies, distinguishing between WMH arising from CSVD subtypes (cerebral amyloid angiopathy
vs. hypertensive), AD, and normal aging. We hypothesize that focusing on ML-derived WMH spatial patterns
will greatly expand the discovery of genetic contributions to WMH, leading to better understanding of the
molecular basis of WMH and development of mechanism-based treatments. To this end, we will leverage
existing neuroimaging and genetic data resources from 7 cohorts enriched for diverse conditions with high
WMH prevalence (n=4,872) as the discovery cohort, and the UK Biobank (UKB, n>60,000) representing the
general population. This will allow us to derive distinct, disease-specific WMH spatial patterns from
neuroimaging data using machine learning, examine their biological correlation with vascular and amyloid-
related traits, and evaluate relevance of ML-derived WMH spatial patterns for predicting long-term
development of stroke or dementia (Aim 1). We will integrate molecular quantitative trait loci (QTL) data into
genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) of ML-derived WMH spatial patterns to prioritize identification of
causal, functionally active genes (Aim 2). We will perform genomics-driven drug discovery using Mendelian
randomization (MR) to identify therapeutic targets relevant to WMH (Aim 3). This project leverages the
combined expertise of the PI and assembled team in neuroimaging, genomics, and informatics. Completion
of project aims will greatly advance our understanding of genetic contributions to WMH, providing novel
mechanistic insights into the role of white matter lesions in brain health, accelerate therapeutic discovery by
identification of drug repositioning opportunities, and lay the groundwork for personalized diagnosis and
care by disentangling the heterogenous nature of WMH at the individual level."

A large percentage of children with Down Syndrome (DS) have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) that is
suboptimally treated by first-line surgical interventions. The persistence of OSA-related nightly intermittent
hypoxemia and fragmented sleep may contribute to a cognitive impairment, as well as pulmonary vascular
disease, myocardial dysfunction, reduced quality of life and daily functional impairment. While oxygen is
sometimes used when other OSA therapies fail, its efficacy and safety have not been systematically studied.
This R61/R33 is therefore designed to test the hypothesis that individuals with DS and moderate to severe OSA
will have a safe and favorable response to low-flow oxygen treatment due to its effects on directly attenuating
hypoxic episodes, with subsequent increased ventilatory stability and improvement in OSA. We further
hypothesize that oxygen supplementation will lead to improvement in neurocognition, cardiac function, sleep,
and quality of life. The R61 phase will actively engage families of patients with DS and our multi-stakeholder
team to refine and pilot the protocol and recruitment strategies to ensure that we meet our recruitment/retention
milestones in the R33 phase and we generate data most relevant to our patient population. In toto, we will
screen approximately 328 children with DS and moderate to severe OSA, 5-17 yrs of age, who failed
adenotonsillectomy, to identify oxygen responders, and then randomize 230 children to oxygen plus conservative
therapy (OXT; administered using a patient-specific dose) or conservative therapy (CT) alone (weight
management, sleep hygiene, nasal dilators) for 6 months. The primary outcome of the trial is working memory
measured by co-primary endpoints that respectively assess caregiver-reported and objectively measured
functions. Secondary outcomes include cardiac function and structure, right ventricular pressure, quality of life
and sleep measures that will be collected under the supervision of experienced, central core laboratories. Six
clinical sites experienced with pediatric clinical trials and established DS centers will participate in the trial. A
Data Coordinating Center experienced with pediatric sleep trials with a strong history of working with these
clinical sites will implement and monitor data quality control processes that addresses all stages of data handling.
This study will fill a key knowledge gap in a potentially efficacious therapy for OSA, and provide evidence to
support (or refute) the use of supplemental oxygen, as well as identify physiological markers to potentially identify
patient subgroups most likely to experience benefit from this therapy."
10951952,"Myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C), a thick filament associated protein of vertebrate striated muscle, is
a key modulator of muscle contractility. Multiple distinct skeletal muscle MyBP-C isoforms are encoded by two
genes in mammals (i.e., MYBPC1 (slow-type) and MYBPC2 (fast-type)) with mutations to these genes now
linked to human skeletal myopathies, such as distal arthrogryposis. In vitro reductionist approaches have
proposed mechanisms by which the MyBP-C N terminus modulates muscle contractility through its binding-
partner interactions with the actin-thin filament and the myosin head region. Specifically, MyBP-C is believed to
sensitize the thin filament to calcium, stabilize the myosin super-relaxed state, and/or act as a molecular “brake”
to slow myofilament sliding. However, since multiple MyBP-C isoforms are co-expressed in mammalian muscle,
it has been impossible to define which of these modulatory roles are linked to specific MyBP-C isoforms within
the context of an intact muscle, let alone how they may be altered by genetic mutations. Here we propose a
novel approach in zebrafish to generate ‘designer’ muscles exclusively expressing a single, transgene-encoded
MyBP-C isoform as desired. Our preliminary data indicate that MyBP-H, an MyBP-C family member, comprises
~95% of myosin binding protein in larval zebrafish swimming muscles. Therefore, Aim 1 makes use of the
recently developed CRISPR/Cas9 ‘GeneWeld’ method, to generate precise integration alleles by homology
mediated end joining (HMEJ) that will simultaneously: i) interrupt endogenous MyBP-H expression, and; ii) place
a DNA cassette, encoding one of two most functionally extreme MyBP-C isoforms, under regulatory control of
the most highly expressed endogenous MyBP gene locus. By this approach, we propose to create zebrafish with
“designer MyBP-C” muscles. Quantitative proteomics will enable us to determine whether transgenic MyBP-C
accumulates to wildtype levels, while immunofluorescence of FLAG-tagged transgenic MyBP-C will be used to
confirm proper subcellular localization. In Aim 2 we use biophysical assays previously developed in the Warshaw
lab to define the functional impact of transgenic MyBP-C isoforms across multiple scales. Specifically, native
myosin thick filaments will be used to assess MyBP-C “braking” action, while myofibrils will be used to assess
the presence of the super-relaxed myosin state. Data from these simplified muscle systems obtained from the
proposed “designer MyBP-C” zebrafish will be correlated with intact larval muscle mechanics. Thus, this project
will provide significant insight into how an individual MyBP-C isoform modulates both molecular and cellular
contractility in the context of intact muscle. This “designer MyBP-C” zebrafish model system will create a platform
for future mechanistic studies of MyBP-C mutations associated with human skeletal myopathies as a first step
to therapeutic design."

to changes in the composition and function of resident intestinal microbes. To gain insight into the mechanisms
responsible for a bacteria-induced barrier protective response, we have examined the roles of various
Lachnospiraceae products, including the short chain fatty acid butyrate and tryptophan metabolites and
commensal flagellins. In this proposal we explore the immunomodulatory capacity of Lachnospiraceae-derived
secondary bile acids (SBAs). Bile acids (BAs) have long been known as emulsifying agents which facilitate the
absorption of dietary lipids in the small intestine. Emerging evidence shows that BAs also potently regulate
mucosal and systemic immunity. In collaboration with the Mimee laboratory at the University of Chicago, we
have used a group II intron-based approach to target 3b-HSDH, a terminal enzyme in the biosynthesis of isoDCA,
in the prominent Lachnospiraceae species [Ruminococcus] gnavus. R. gnavus is among a small group of gut
bacteria which possess both the 3a- and 3b- HSDHs required to epimerize DCA into isoDCA. By pairing this
novel mutant R. gnavus with the Clostridial strain P. hiranonis we have created a two-strain consortium that
allows us to toggle isoDCA production on and off (while keeping other bacterial products and metabolites
constant) in mice with a replete microbiome. This innovative approach will enable an interrogation of the
mechanisms by which Lachnospiraceae-derived isoDCA modulates host immunity at homeostasis and an
assessment of its immunomodulatory potential in well-established models of intestinal inflammation. We
hypothesize that isoDCA has anti-inflammatory effects on all levels of the intestinal immune system including
intestinal epithelial cells and CD11c+ antigen presenting cells through the Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and the
G-protein coupled bile acid receptor (GPBAR1/TGR5). In the first Aim we will identify key cell types and signaling
mechanisms involved in the immunomodulatory activity of isoDCA. We will then examine the mechanisms by
which isoDCA ameliorates intestinal inflammation in Aim 2."

20 Centiloids with 88% sensitivity and 90% specificity. We propose to leverage the HABS-HD cohort plasma
samples to quantify plasma Aβ42/40 and p-tau217 levels in amyloid PET positive and negative in Hispanic and
AA populations to determine cutoffs relevant to ethnicity and race. The overarching hypothesis of this project is
that plasma biomarkers related to AD pathology present differently among diverse populations and as a result
have different relations to established clinical outcomes such as PET amyloid levels and cognitive outcomes.
To test this hypothesis, we propose to characterize plasma p-tau217 and Aβ42/40 in Mexican Americans, AA
and non-Hispanic white populations of the HABS-HD study. Additionally, we propose to investigate how other
AD hallmarks are associated with p-tau217 and Aβ42/40 in these individual populations. Resultant data will not
only document the biomarker protein levels for the HABS-HD cohort for sharing in the longitudinal study but
may also inform on whether amyloid PET scans can be reduced in the screening process."
10861996,"Buprenorphine has emerged as a leading treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), but recipients have high
early relapse rates likely due to varying degrees of dysfunction within craving and cognitive control neuronal
networks. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may have promise as adjuvant treatment for
buprenorphine initiators because considerable work on addictive substances suggests treatment targeted at the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; region involved in self-regulation) may reduce craving and drug
consumption. We will measure behavioral and brain responses following tDCS stimulation to the DLPFC
delivered during cognitive control network (CCN) priming. Participants in their first week of prescribed
buprenorphine will be assessed twice using FMRI, once prior to tDCS+CCN priming and again at the
completion of 5 sessions of tDCS+CCN priming (one week later). Task-based and resting state functional
connectivity will be used to examine networks associated with craving (CR) and cognitive control. In the UG3
phase (n=60), FMRI will provide validation of expected changes in these networks following tDCS stimulation.
Go/no go criteria for the UH3 phase will be demonstration of greater FMRI change in any node of the CR or
CCN networks AND greater change in subjective craving measured prior to (outside FMRI scan) or during an
FMRI cue reactivity task following the tDCS+CCN priming intervention compared to sham tDCS+CCN
priming. In the UH3 phase (n=100), we will perform a larger RCT (vs. sham control) to address long-term
neurobehavioral outcomes, including opioid relapse, craving, and sustained fMRI changes. Because tDCS is
safe, inexpensive and portable, if this intervention provides FMRI validation of targeted brain effects and
produces clinical response, it could have great impact augmenting the care of persons entering buprenorphine
treatment, a population at high risk for treatment failure."
10951956,"The homeostatic plasticity allows neural circuits to restore baseline function by rebalancing pre- or post-
synaptic function. Impaired homeostatic responses underlie the pathophysiology of a variety of neurological
and psychiatric diseases. The core principle of homeostatic plasticity is that synaptic strength is scaled up or
down proportionally to the degree of neural disturbance. Without this synaptic scaling, information flow can be
lost or distorted. One of the key factors that regulate neurotransmitter release and thus synaptic strength is the
abundance of voltage-gated CaV2 calcium channels at the presynaptic terminal. To elucidate the relationship
between CaV2/UNC-2 channel abundance and neurotransmitter release, we used the nematode C. elegans, a
simple genetic model organism that possesses highly conserved CaV2 channels and active zone proteins.
Using CRISPR/Cas9, we endogenously tagged CaV2/UNC-2 channels with GFP and introduced either a gain-
or loss-of-function mutation. When we compared wild-type and UNC-2 mutant forms, we found that channel
function inversely correlates with their abundance. However, our preliminary data showed that synaptic vesicle
(SV) exocytosis, but not channel function itself, dictates UNC-2 abundance. Loss of UNC-13 function, which
causes an SV exocytosis defect, increases channel abundance. In contrast, an open syntaxin mutation, which
enhances SV exocytosis by bypassing SV priming, decreases channel abundance. Based on these findings,
we hypothesize that a high rate of neurotransmitter release negatively regulates CV2/UNC-2 channel levels.
This negative feedback regulatory mechanism provides presynaptic neurons with the ability to scale up or
down neurotransmitter release by adjusting CaV2 channel levels independently of postsynaptic inputs. To
further validate our hypothesis, we will employ a wide array of SV exocytosis mutations alongside optogenetic
and chemical genetic tools to delve deeper into the mechanisms controlling presynaptic UNC-2 levels.
Concurrently, we aim to identify the core active zone proteins crucial for activity-dependent UNC-2 abundance
modulation. Completion of the project will validate a previously unidentified form of presynaptic homeostatic
plasticity that operates independently of post-synaptic inputs."
10952012,"Although immunoassays are a critical part of bioanalytical chemistry, the rapid and selective analysis of
biomolecules continues to be a complicated aspect of biomedical research. The long-term goal is to develop
single-entity electrochemistry to improve the current methods, primarily based on enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and related techniques. The PI aims to use electrochemical detection for
simultaneous qualitative and quantitative analysis down to a single bioconjugate to allow rapid routine
detection. The overall objective in this proposal is to use antibody/antigen interactions as proof of concept for
single entity amperometry: measure the current vs. time at ultramicroelectrodes (UME, diam < 30 micrometers)
that will respond to single antibody/antigen conjugates. The antibodies will be tagged to Au nanoparticles
(NPs) and detected using electrochemical reactions. The central hypothesis is that we can measure currents
from individual antibody/antigen conjugates by measuring the reaction rate of separate redox mediators. The
rationale is that electrochemical detection of antigens should be possible under conditions relevant to
biomedical analysis. We will achieve single biomolecule resolution by detecting individual bioconjugates
interacting with an electrode surface. By isolating a single bioconjugate, we will demonstrate a detection limit of
a single molecular antigen in the direct assay mode. The project will test the central hypothesis by pursuing the
following specific aims: (1) developing a redox-mediated approach suitable for antibody-NP detection. (2)
Antibody/Antigen detection in biological samples. We will study the selectivity of the technique and leveraging
electron transfer (ET) through pinholes as a suitable mechanism to overcome biofouling. This aim also
includes the effect of non-specific binding and agglomeration or aggregation. The distance between the
electrode and the NP, attached to an antibody, is relatively large for tunneling, and the distance-dependence of
ET will translate into a time-dependence of the experimental current that will be used to discriminate specific vs
non-specific interactions. To design a redox-mediated scheme, we will use Marcus theory of ET to select the
redox pairs. The detection schemes will be validated with assays used for ensemble measurements, and we
will pursue the detection of single molecules using the novel redox-mediated single-entity electrochemical
scheme. The applicant believes the proposed research is innovative because it focuses on single-entity
electrochemistry that is expected to yield single molecule detection through antibody/NP conjugates. The
proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide a novel way for the rapid and sensitive
detection of antibody/antigen interactions, with the potential of enabling simultaneous qualitative and
quantitative information with minimal supplies and electrochemical instrumentation."

While control of emissions is the most effective method of reducing air pollution exposure, people living in low
and middle-income countries (LMICs) are often exposed to many sources of air pollution simultaneously,
making a single intervention to reduce emissions difficult. High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter-based
portable air cleaners (PACs) have been demonstrated to effectively reduce particulate matter (PM) exposure
regardless of the source, but several barriers have limited their use in LMIC settings. Our overall objective in
this research is to demonstrate that an optimized PAC platform can reduce PM exposure in an LMIC
household. Our central hypothesis is that PACs can reduce PM, can remain continuously powered, and can be
used consistently within an LMIC home. We propose to test this hypothesis among 20 households within an
established cohort in Uganda in a study with the following Specific Aims: 1) Identify and optimize
environmental factors that maximize PM reduction associated with PAC use in a real-world LMIC setting; 2)
Design and test the optimal power supply for a PAC in a setting with unreliable electricity; and 3) Determine the
feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to a PAC intervention in families of children with a history of
pneumonia. In Aim 1, we will perform a series of controlled experiments in simulation settings and real-world
experiments in rural and urban households to measure the effect of PAC filtration rate and location, building
characteristics, sources and concentration of air pollution, and seasonality on the efficacy of PM reduction. In
Aim 2, we will assess the characteristics of both the power supply and demand of the PAC system, determine
the optimal components of a solar and battery backup system for powering the PAC, and create analytic
models for various scenarios of power demand and availability. In Aim 3, we will administer structured surveys,
obtain time-activity diaries, and conduct focus group discussions among adults and children in the households
participating in real-world testing of PACs. We will perform a mixed methods evaluation focused on perceptions
of benefits vs. burdens of PAC use and identify predictors of efficacy and adherence. The output of this
research will provide the scientific justification for an R01-funded intervention trial of PACs in an LMIC setting.
Current options to reduce PM exposure for people living in LMICs are limited, but following this study and a
subsequent PAC intervention trial, clinicians and policymakers will have evidence to inform recommendations
for the use of PACs."

10954686,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Myofascial Pelvic Pain (MPP) is a frequently overlooked musculoskeletal cause of chronic pelvic pain
affecting 10-20% of all adult women. Pelvic floor muscle tightening in MPP results in acidosis and
accumulation of neuroinflammatory mediators, leading to self-reinforcing pelvic pain and bowel, bladder,
and sexual dysfunction. A challenge in the management of MPP has been a lack of quantitative measures
of pelvic floor physiology capable of quantifying functional alterations in the pelvic floor musculature in 3-
dimensional space. This deficiency has in turn hampered both a greater understanding of the mechanisms
of MPP and the development of novel therapeutics. Our research group has developed an innovative
approach to identify pelvic floor muscle dysfunction using a near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS) optical,
vaginal interface designed to image and quantify in real-time oxygenation and hemodynamics regionally
throughout the pelvic floor in response to contraction and relaxation of the muscle. During the R61 phase,
we plan to validate this technology as an effective, non-invasive, and scalable method to assess pelvic floor
muscle fitness. We will seek to establish parameters to describe the severity and spatial patterns of
myofascial dysfunction and how these parameters correlate with individual muscular assessment, the
spectrum of pelvic pain manifestations, and bowel, bladder, and sexual complaints. We will also correlate
these findings with current subjective methods of pelvic floor assessment in control subjects and MPP
subjects, specifically focusing on the ability of NIRS to provide repeatable measurements independent of
user expertise and training. In the R33 phase, we will utilize this technology to examine prospective changes
in pelvic floor fitness in MPP patients following a range of myofascially-directed therapies, including
pharmacologic muscle relaxation, onabotulinumA toxin pelvic floor injection, and myofascial release
physical therapy. We will correlate NIRS outcomes and symptomatic measures with systemic inflammatory
markers pre- and post-treatment to understand better the role of neuroinflammation in the clinical syndrome
of MPP. We will also employ machine learning models to examine if this technology can be utilized to predict
responses to individual treatments. Demonstration that objective measures of muscle fitness recover as
symptoms improve following myofascially-directed therapies will provide the first direct evidence of the
underlying nature of MPP, evidence needed to evolve current therapeutic approaches. Through
interdisciplinary collaboration of specialists in urology, gynecology, integrative medicine, and computational
medicine, this novel imaging technique providing both spatial and functional evaluation of the pelvic floor
will assist in the diagnosis and management of chronic pelvic pain and promote additional research into
novel approaches to address the poorly recognized epidemic of myofascial pelvic pain in women."
10946702,"Abstract
The four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV1–4) are the leading cause of mosquito-borne viral diseases in
humans. Dengvaxia, the first licensed dengue vaccine, was recommended for individuals aged 9–45 years in
2016. In the Philippines, a school-based vaccination program was launched in April 2016 with >830,000
children receiving Dengvaxia without prior serological testing. Subsequently, DENV-seronegative children who
received Dengvaxia developed severe disease after breakthrough DENV infection (BTDI). This resulted in the
revised recommendation in 2018 that Dengvaxia be administered only to DENV-seropositive individuals. Thus,
thousands of Filipino children are at higher risk of severe dengue disease. Studies have shown the efficacy of
Dengvaxia waned over time especially among baseline DENV-seronegative recipients, underscoring a critical
need for elucidation of antibody and T-cell responses induced by Dengvaxia. Our understanding of Dengvaxia
was primarily based on efficacy trials with 3-dose regimen. A knowledge gap exists regarding the risk of severe
disease and effectiveness in the real world, where most individuals received only 1 or 2 doses and presented
with BTDI. In collaboration with the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, our recent study demonstrated the
feasibility of our DENV1–4 nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) IgG ELISA to determine the baseline DENV
serostatus of Dengvaxia recipients during both BTDI and other febrile illness (OFI) in the Philippines.
Our long-term goal is to facilitate the development of next-generation dengue vaccines and to reduce the global
disease burden of dengue. The objective is to understand the long-term effects of Dengvaxia, a chimeric yellow
fever tetravalent dengue vaccine, and the immune responses induced in the Filipino population. The central
hypothesis is that Dengvaxia induces antibody and T-cell responses inferior to natural infection, leading to
limited type-specific neutralizing antibodies, weak T-cell responses and waning vaccine efficacy especially for
baseline DENV-naïve recipients. The first aim is to determine the baseline DENV serostatus of Dengvaxia
recipients in the Philippines and assess the long-term safety and effectiveness of Dengvaxia. The second aim is
to characterize antibody and T-cell responses induced by Dengvaxia prior to and after BTDI.
The proposed research is innovative as it combines RT-PCR and IgM ELISA used in routine dengue fever
surveillance and our recently validated DENV1−4 NS1 IgG ELISA to determine baseline DENV serostatus
under field conditions and provides new insights into the safety and effectiveness of Dengvaxia after mass
vaccination through a manufacturer-independent study as opposed to that derived from vaccine efficacy trials.
Given that previous immunogenicity studies of Dengvaxia primarily focused on neutralizing antibody titers, our
in-depth study of antibody responses both qualitatively and quantitatively and T-cell responses to structural
and nonstructural proteins is highly significant. This information is translational and will facilitate the
development of next-generation live-attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine or other chimeric vaccines."

Siladosis is a rare, lysosomal storage disorder that causes fatal neurological disease that has no effective
therapy. It is caused by loss of function mutations in the NEU1 gene. The type 1 form affects young adults with
progressive vision loss and myoclonic seizures that progresses to blindness and uncontrollable movements of
arms and legs requiring physical restraint. It is fatal in middle age. The Type 2 form affects children with
developmental delay, seizures, blindness, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone deformities that progresses a semi-
vegetative state and death in childhood. We have developed and tested three adeno associated virus (AAV)
constructs: AAV9 encoding human NEU1 (AAV9-Neu1), AAV9 encoding human NEU1 with an IUDA signal
peptide(AAV_NEU1_IUDAsp) and an AAV9 with a bidirectional promoter encoding both NEU1 and its protective
protein cathepsin A (CTSA; AAV9- CTSA-bici-NEU1). These vectors were tested in wild type and sialidosis
(Neu1 -/-) mice. All three vectors appeared equivalent until 10 months when one wild type and two sialidosis
mice in the AAV9-Neu1 treatment group developed seizures. Histology of the AAV9-Neu1 cohort revealed a
diffuse cytoplasmic subcellular localization as compared to from the AAV9-NEU1-bici-CTSA cohort where there
was a vacuolated appearance consistent with lysosomal localization. For these reasons we selected the AAV9-
NEU1-bici-CTSA for clinical translation. Our team consists of Dr. Gray-Edwards (PI) is an expert in large animal
AAV gene therapy and has taken several AAV gene therapies to the clinic through testing in large animal models
of human genetic diseases. Dr. Allison Keeler (co-I) who is an expert in the immune response to AAV in humans
and is extending this expertise to better understand the immune response in AAV treated sialidosis sheep. Dr.
Tifft (collaborator) is the director of the orphan disease center at the NIH and is conducting a natural history study
in sialidosis patients. While this human natural history study is out of scope for this proposal Dr. Tifft will help
determine if changes in sheep and biomarkers evaluated correlate with human data. The experimental design
of the proposal is as follows:
Aim 1: Dose escalation, efficacy and safety in sialidosis mice. Neu1-/- and wild type mice will be used to
determine the minimum effective dose and maximum tolerated dose of AAV9-NEU1-bici-CTSA for the FDA.
Aim 2: AAV testing in a sheep model of sialidosis. We have developed a novel sheep model of sialidosis
using CRISPR Cas9 that recapitulates the human phenotype. We will use this model to refine our treatment
strategy, delivery route, immune responses and predict efficacy for future clinical trials.
Aim 3: IND enabling safety studies in wild type mice and sheep. The FDA requires the toxicology studies
using two species, including a non-rodent species. We will perform toxicology studies in sheep and rats to
establish safety before clinical trials."

An estimated 400 metric tons of plastic are produced each year worldwide and less than 10% is recycled.
Microplastics (MPs) defined as particles <5mm generated from weathering and wear of discarded plastic trash,
tires and textiles are now ubiquitous in the environment. MPs enter the body by ingestion, inhalation and contact
with skin and MPs have been identified in all human tissue types studied including blood, placenta and lung. The
impacts of internalized MPs on health are unknown. Given that MPs may be coated with toxic chemicals and
‘biofilms’ containing pathogens, and the physical presence of MPs may induce local inflammatory and immune
responses, there is urgent need to establish carcinogenic potential of MP exposures in body sites such as the
lung. In this R21 we propose to interrogate bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid for MPs in thoracic oncology
patients to gain insights on the potential relationship of MPs with lung cancer (LCa), the leading cancer diagnosis
and cause of cancer death in the US and most western countries. Prior studies have documented BAL as a
minimally invasive approach to isolate and characterize MPs in the airway of living persons. In the proposed
R21, a total of ~275 patients undergoing BAL at Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL for suspected new primary
LCa, staging of another primary neoplasm, or diagnosis of lung infection will be enrolled and a 10-mL sample of
recovered BAL fluid reserved for study of MPs. Patients with a history of surgeries or BAL of the affected lung
will be ineligible. Participants will complete a survey on demographics, smoking and occupational history, and
medical records will be reviewed to capture history of pulmonary diseases and procedures. MPs in BAL fluid will
be studied in a physics laboratory at the University of South Florida, Tampa, FL and characterized for abundance
and morphology using standard optical and Atomic Force Microscopy, and for chemical composition using
Raman spectroscopy, methods widely used in emerging studies of MPs in biologic and environmental samples.
Stringent processes will be in place to limit contamination from ambient MPs in the clinic and lab. In a series of
300 study participants, including ~25 from our recently initiated pilot study, patients with confirmed incident LCa
(~50% of the participants) will be compared to patients with other pathologies on total number of MPs in BAL
samples with adjustment for patient age, gender, race, smoking history and occupation in regression models.
Associations will be examined with LCa overall and, in exploratory analyses, with LCa subtype (i.e.,
adenocarcinoma versus other LCas). Other features of MPs including morphology, polymer subtype (e.g.,
polyethylele terephthalate (i.e., polyester); polypropylene; and semisynthetic polymer fibers (i.e., rayon)), and
surface coatings and contaminants will also be explored for associations with LCa risk. The proposed
investigation offers one of the first studies to examine MP impacts on human health with a focus on LCa. Data
generated will help fill an important knowledge gap and provide a foundation for future research on this now
ubiquitous pollutant worldwide."

Most symptomatic Latina women do not receive a diagnosis or initiate mental health (MH) treatment (Tx) when
warranted. Stigma, cultural concerns, distrust of professionals, lack of insurance, and not knowing where to get
help are barriers so many suffer from untreated depression and/or anxiety. Due to high social media and
YouTube use and high demand for story-based media among Latinas, however, our multidisciplinary team
created and tested a choice-driven, Hollywood-quality web-based app featuring transmedia storytelling videos
called Catalina: Confronting My Emotions/ Enfrentando Mis Emociones (in English and Spanish) to help
Latinas overcome barriers to initiate MH Tx. Multiple waves of theater-testing and pilot testing showed
symptomatic, untreated Latinas reported high identification with the Latina lead-character and high trust of the
Latina nurse-therapist character; all was developed using composite data from past qualitative studies with
Latinas. Using transmedia (storytelling across multiple digital platforms), the story expands beyond a traditional
episode through character-driven, interactive bonus videos and social media posts of the characters that are
also psychoeducational plus a character’s blog with links to free MH resources and recommendations of local
clinics offering low-cost Tx plus Tx locator. A Latinx cast, director, and script writer enhance socio-cultural
acceptability and bring Latinas back to re-watch videos. Access is discreet via smartphone, tablet, or computer.
Guided by Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behavior and supported in feasibility and efficacy testing, we identified
targets that mediate help-seeking behavior change including attitudes, propensity to seek help, and stigma. For
this 2-arm RCT, Aim 1 is to determine the effectiveness of the Catalina experimental transmedia web-based
app compared to a control condition (informational MH videos but no story, links to publicly available MH
websites, and Tx locator for low-cost options) across 9 months (baseline, 1, 5, and 9 months) to catalyze
therapy or pharmacotherapy initiation. Both groups will receive monthly reminder messages via text or email.
Consent procedures allow for verification from medical records if MH Tx appointments were made, kept, or
missed and if prescriptions were filled. We hypothesize that, compared to controls, a significantly greater
proportion of the Catalina group will initiate MH Tx during the 9-month study. Aim 2 is to test the mediation role
of the targets (help-seeking attitudes, propensity to seek help, and stigma) across 9 months to initiate MH Tx in
Catalina vs. control groups. The sample will include 876 English and Spanish speaking Latinas, age 18 and
older, who are untreated but symptomatic for depression and/or anxiety (>10 on PHQ8 or GAD7) and who
have internet access. All aspects of the study are done online. If hypothesized relationships are supported this
study has potential for high impact on English and Spanish speaking Latinas, for whom viable MH solutions are
often less accessible. Knowledge gained about drivers that catalyze Tx initiation will expand strategies to help
symptomatic Latinas overcome barriers and connect to needed MH Tx via our scalable app for low cost."

 The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated many existing inequalities, including access to
child care, education, and family support services. Children in low-income families and
minorities, already vulnerable, were overrepresented in areas with high rates of pandemic-
induced child care center closures. This is especially concerning in a context where children
exposed to environmental risk factors like poverty and maltreatment face significant barriers in
early identification of developmental disorders and early intervention. Child care centers can be
instrumental for timely identification and reporting developmental delays, and early intervention
is key to prevent further developmental disorders. Early education and quality child care have
been found to help vulnerable children’s development in many dimensions. Therefore, the
potential impact of the pandemic in general, and of childcare center closures in particular, on
vulnerable children’s development is concerning. To date, little is known about the quantitative
impact of these disruptions on vulnerable children’s outcomes.
 The purpose of the proposed analysis is to measure the effects of decreased access to
child care centers during the pandemic on COVID-19 pandemic on developmental screening
outcomes of infants and toddlers in low-income and at-risk families who receive services from a
home visitation program. In a context of pre-existing inequities, this project also seeks to
elucidate how structural inequalities disproportionately hurting low-income families and racial-
ethnic minorities affect this impact. Inferring causality about these issues is typically challenging
because a family’s characteristics that affect its childcare options and location decisions may
also determine the child’s developmental outcomes. To tackle this issue, we will exploit the
geographic variation in disruptions in child care centers closures during the pandemic as a
natural experiment generating exogenous variation in availability.
 Correctly assessing any expected deteriorations in the developmental progress of
vulnerable and at-risk children in these communities is crucial to determine early intervention
actions that can address this issue. Results from this work will increase our understanding of the
potential long-term consequences of the COVID-19 crisis via its effect on vulnerable children.
Our findings will also speak to the broader issue of the consequences of structural inequalities
and lack of family support for our children’s development, and can serve as guidelines for
policies and health initiatives targeted at vulnerable children and their families."
10954535,"Expand human umbilical cord blood hematopoietic stem cells with PPAR-a agonists
Abstract
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are defined by their self-renewal potential and ability to differentiate into
multiple blood lineages. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is a mainstay of life-saving therapy for
hematopoietic malignancies and hypoproliferative disorders. The use of umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived
HSCs provides many advantages over adult HSCs, including enhanced long-term immune recovery,
decreased graft versus host disease, and availability of donors from a broad population, expanding the
availability of HSCT for groups currently underrepresented in bone marrow registries. The use of haploidentical
transplants addresses many of these issues, but UCB would still be a highly useful resource if UCB units
contained sufficient numbers of HSCs. However, the low cell dose in most UCB units limits their use, as
insufficient HSCs leads to delayed engraftment, graft failure, and severe infectious complications. Even a
modest expansion of HSCs from UCB can solve many of these problems, and thus HSC expansion from UCB
has remained an important goal for the field.
Our goal is to use cryopreserved UCB from the NHLBI Biologic Biospecimen Repository to develop
new methods to expand functional HSCs for therapeutic applications. Recent studies have achieved ex
vivo expansion of HSCs using cytokine cocktails combined with small molecules, but these approaches require
exposure to high concentrations of cytokines. Cytokines induce differentiation and impair the self-renewal
function of primitive HSCs. HSC expansion with minimal cytokine exposure would therefore be ideal for clinical
applications. Our previous studies demonstrated a combination of two inhibitors (CHIR99021 and rapamycin)
maintains human and mouse long-term HSCs ex vivo in the absence of cytokines or serum. Based on this
finding, we performed a high throughput screen and identified several PPAR-a agonists, which are used
clinically to treat hypertriglyceridemia, that significantly expand long-term functional UCB HSC ex vivo while
minimizing exposure to cytokines. In this project, we will carry out studies to optimize and implement our
PPAR-a agonists-based expansion method using cryopreserved UCB stored in the NHLBI Biologic
Biospecimen Repository."
10953876,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Manganese (Mn) is a trace nutrient that is essential for viability of organisms from bacteria to humans. Mn serves as
an enzyme cofactor to help catalyze diverse chemical reactions. Mn also detoxifies and protects cells from reactive
oxygen species. For these reasons, many pathogenic and symbiotic bacteria require Mn to survive in eukaryotic host
tissues. However, excess Mn can be toxic. Therefore cells must carefully regulate the intracellular levels of Mn
through homeostasis systems. In addition to a Mn importer and exporter, a small protein of only 42 amino acids
called MntS helps control intracellular Mn levels in Escherichia coli. Despite its phenotypic connection to Mn
homeostasis, many aspects of the regulation and binding interactions of MntS are not understood.
 MntS is a member of the poorly-characterized class of small proteins (< 50 amino acids) that have unique
structural and functional properties due to their short length. Although few of the vast number of predicted small
proteins have been characterized, one emerging theme is their interaction with and regulation of larger proteins. We
have demonstrated that MntS binds and inhibits the Mn exporter MntP in E. coli. We have also showed that MntS
evolved from the signal peptide (SP) region of the SitA Mn importer. Surprisingly, the SitA SP alone can function
like MntS, making it the first example of a dual-function SP in gram-negative bacteria. Even less is known about
cleaved functional SPs than small proteins, but with a demonstrated activity in Mn homeostasis, the SitA SP is a
promising entry into characterizing fundamental aspects of bacterial SPs with second functions.
 Our overall goals are to uncover the mechanism of action of the model small protein MntS in Mn homeostasis
and to use lessons learned from MntS to understand other small proteins. We also aim to use principles identified
from studying the functional SitA SP to address basic questions about how these SPs are produced and localized in
cells. In Aim 1, we will systematically identify mutants of MntS and MntP that disrupt their interactions. We will
also test whether MntS binding causes MntP degradation. In Aim 2, we will investigate how the MntS protein is
regulated by proteolysis. We will identify the sequence determinants in MntS that lead to its rapid cellular turnover,
as well as the cellular determinants causing its degradation. In Aim 3, we will characterize how the functional SitA
SP is produced in cells and where in the cell it functions, with the goal of determining important features of the SP
that may allow us to find additional functional SPs.
 These studies will give mechanistic information about Mn homeostasis in E. coli and related enterobacteria that
may enable scientists to manipulate bacterial populations in eukaryotic hosts or the environment. In the long-term,
these findings may help decrease disease by allowing us to eliminate pathogenic bacteria and aid growth of
beneficial bacteria. Additionally, fundamental knowledge gained about functional SPs and small protein
biochemistry and physiology from these studies will further understanding of how cells function and could be used
to design novel small proteins with specific desired functions."
10946605,"Although numerous genes and loci associated with autism spectrum disorder and neurodevelopmental delay
(ASD/NDD) have been identified through genome sequencing efforts, the precise mechanisms by which most of
these genetic variants lead to the condition remain largely unknown. We propose to combine high-content in vivo
genetic screening with whole brain cytoarchitecture spatial information from neurons with loss-of-function
mutations in ASD/NDD risk genes to bridge the gap between genetic insights and mechanistic understanding.
This approach, which can be scaled to interrogate large panels of genetic variants in parallel, has the power to
reveal how these diverse gene variants converge to produce ASD/NDD, including identifying the specific brain
regions, cell types, neural circuits, developmental time windows, and molecular networks involved in the
pathogenesis of these disorders.
To achieve this, we propose to use high-resolution and multimodal phenotypic characterizations to
comprehensively map the functions in the neocortex and striatum of a set of 72 high-confidence ASD/NDD risk
genes, many of which encode transcriptional regulators. We will adapt in vivo Perturb-seq to allow high efficiency
screening across multiple developmental time points with both single-nucleus transcriptome and chromatin
accessibility readouts. These rich datasets will enable us to build gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that will
reveal shared and divergent molecular signatures associated with this set of ASD/NDD risk genes. In parallel,
we will explore how perturbation of 5 high-confidence ASD/NDD risk genes impacts cellular migration,
morphology, and long-range connectivity. Here, we will use Perturb-CAST (cytoarchitecture see-through) to
combine sparse genetic perturbations in vivo with whole mount brain clearing and light-sheet imaging to examine
brain-wide changes in cytoarchitecture across developmental time points.
This work will expand two major technologies, in vivo Perturb-seq and Perturb-CAST, which will be broadly

10945772,"Project Summary
 Biologic drugs and nanomedicines with conjugated polyethylene glycol (PEG) show extended circulation in
the blood, increasing therapeutic efficacy. The U.S. FDA has approved more than 30 PEGylated biologics,
including proteins, nucleotides, and peptides, and a few PEGylated nanomedicines, for example COVID-19
mRNA vaccines. Attached PEG chains increase the hydrodynamic radiuses of these therapeutics to reduce their
renal clearance during blood circulation. More importantly, PEG conceals therapeutics from immune cells by
repelling plasma proteins, rendering therapeutics stealth behavior. The adsorption of a few types of plasma
proteins onto therapeutics can lead to the removal of therapeutics by immune cells. PEG chains are hydrophilic
and flexible. They can repel plasma proteins through a thermodynamic-driven entropic repulsion. Despite the
unique advantage, the application of PEGylated therapeutics is limited by the presence of anti-PEG antibodies
(aPEG Abs). These antibodies not only accelerate the clearance of PEGylated therapeutics and attenuate their
efficacies but may also cause severe side effects. Varied percentages of populations were found to have pre-
existing aPEG Abs in different studies, with the percentage as high as 40%. The high prevalence is likely due to
the broad use of PEG in cosmetic and healthcare products. To further improve the pharmacokinetics of
therapeutics and circumvent the problem of aPEG Abs, researchers have strived to find PEG alternatives.
Among these alternative polymers, zwitterionic polymers have attracted the most attention. In contrast to PEG,
zwitterionic polymers repel protein adsorption by forming a hydration layer around the polymers. We hypothesize
that zwitterionic PEG (ZPEG) that combines the advantageous characteristics of both PEG and conventional
zwitterionic polymers will be superior to them in extending the circulation of therapeutics and minimize the
generation of anti-ZPEG antibodies. To develop a ZPEG to replace PEG for therapeutic delivery, we propose
the following research plans: 1) synthesize and characterize ZPEG with different chemical structures and reveal
the mechanism of enhanced blood circulation of ZPEG-modified proteins; 2) investigate the immunogenicity of
ZPEG; 3) investigate the pharmacokinetics and immune responses of nanoparticles covered with ZPEG.
Because of the broad application of PEG, an excellent PEG replacement will generate tremendous societal
impact. This project will pave the way to replace PEG with ZPEG in therapeutic delivery for minimized side effects
and consistent efficacy."

 B cell malignancies comprise more than 50% of blood cancers, approximately 85% of lymphomas, and all
myelomas. Despite recent treatment advancements that significantly prolong patient survival, many B cell
malignancies remain incurable, highlighting the necessity for a deeper understanding of the disease
pathogenesis. During the past 3 decades, research efforts on the pathogenesis of B cell malignancies have
been primarily focused on the genetic and epigenetic alterations as well as their oncogenic signaling pathways.
Recent endeavors have advanced the understanding of the influence of stromal cells and immune cell subsets
on malignant B cells in the tumor microenvironment. This new R01 project aims to elucidate novel paradigm-
shifting mechanisms of B cell tumorigenesis, treatment resistance, and relapse driven by commensal bacteria-
derived molecules. We reason that commensal bacteria outnumber human cells in the body and constitute the
largest pool of antigens for B cell antigen receptors (BCRs) and ligands for Toll-like receptors (TLRs)
expressed on B cells in humans. Although commensal bacteria have been implicated in the carcinogenesis of
other human cancers such as colon, colorectal, pancreatic, liver, lung, and breast cancers, B lymphocytes are
the only cell type of the human body that expresses specific antigen receptors (BCRs) and can produce
specific antibodies in response to commensal bacterial antigens. Even in the absence of commensal bacteria
transmigration or systemic infection, commensal bacterial antigens and ligands, in the format of soluble
molecules or large fragments, can be released from commensal bacteria via secretion, shedding, digestion, or
bacterial death-associated decomposition. Such commensal bacteria-derived soluble molecules or large
fragments, including antigens and ligands, may gain access to various B cell subsets in lymphoid organs
through the blood circulation and lymphatic drainage. However, investigation of commensal bacteria-derived
molecules in B cell tumorigenesis is lacking. We will address this critical gap in cancer research. Based on our
proof-of-concept preliminary data, we will test the central hypothesis that commensal bacterial molecules can
engage BCR and TLR signaling to drive B cell tumorigenesis, treatment resistance, and relapse. We will
further exploit such new knowledge to develop novel diagnostics and therapeutics to improve early detection
and treatment of B cell malignancies and to prevent relapse. Such commensal bacteria-based diagnostics and
therapeutics have mechanisms of action distinct from and complementary to currently available diagnostics
and therapeutics, and therefore can be easily integrated into the current standard-of-care system to transform
the management landscape of B cell malignancies and improve patient outcome."
10944383,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. While
numerous scientific advances have been made to improve the care of patients with COPD, current therapeutic
options remain limited. The growing availability of electronic health data and new computational tools have
brought an unprecedented opportunity to accelerate the discovery of new therapeutic options for COPD via the
analysis of existing health care data. We hypothesize that observational health data can be utilized to identify
drug repurposing opportunities for COPD in a valid and expeditious way.
The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a population-based analytics and data infrastructure that will
allow robust and valid evaluation of non-COPD drugs and COPD outcomes in patients with COPD, leveraging
existing claims data sources and state-of-the-art methods for causal inference. The claims data will cover U.S.
commercially insured individuals and Medicare beneficiaries. Electronic health records (EHR) and longitudinal
data from COPDGene, a cohort of almost 5,000 smokers with longitudinal collection of extensive clinical and
patient-reported data over 10-year period, will be linked to claims and used to develop, validate, or further refine
key definitions for claims-based analyses, including endpoints, COPD severity markers, and COPD subtypes.
The infrastructure will be developed using statins and diabetes medications, and further refined via emulation of
selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated non-COPD medications for the prevention of COPD
exacerbations in patients with COPD over the past decade. We will also evaluate the comparative effectiveness
of new immunomodulating agents, such as dupilumab. While many previous observational studies of repurposed
medications have been found to have substantial bias, we will build on the lessons learned in
pharmacoepidemiology over the past decade and use causal inference methods that have demonstrated high
validity in previous investigations and RCT emulation projects. Finally, as part of the project we will conduct
thorough assessment of treatment effect heterogeneity across patient subgroups, including, but not limited to
subgroups based on age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, and comedications, as well as COPD subtypes
developed as part of this proposal.
The proposed work will generate highly needed evidence on the impact of selected non-COPD medications on
COPD outcomes. More importantly, it will form the foundation for future monitoring and evaluation of repurposing
opportunities in COPD, expediting the path to discovery of new therapeutic targets for this debilitating disease."

Title: Invasive Anopheles stephensi in Ghana: Sampling Tools and Vector Population Dynamics
Anopheles stephensi, an invasive mosquito species originating from Southeast Asia and the Arabian Peninsula,
has been expanding its spread in Africa over the past decade. It was first detection in Djibouti, the Horn of Africa,
in 2012, and this event was associated with an outbreak of urban malaria. The vector has later been found in
Ethiopia in 2016 and 2018, Sudan in 2016, Somalia in 2019, Nigeria in 2020 and Kenya in 2023. The most recent
discovery of Anopheles stephensi was made in Ghana in March 2023. The discovery of An. stephensi in Ghana
is concerning due to significant knowledge gaps on the extent of spread, densities in sentinel sites and the
bionomics of An. stephensi. It has been observed that the larval ecology of An. stephensi in Ghana differs
substantially from what has been reported in the Indian subcontinent and in East Africa. Consequently, there is
a pressing need for increased research efforts to gain a deeper understanding of the larval ecology and
bionomics of this invasive species in Ghana. Moreover, the most efficient surveillance tool for An. stephensi and
other native urban African mosquito vectors have not been systematically evaluated. Data on the spread,
bionomics and sampling tools for An. stephensi is very important for making informed decisions regarding
effective interventions for An. stephensi control and elimination in Ghana. The central objective of this application
is to compare sampling tools for invasive An. stephensi and native malaria vectors, and determine the
extent of spread, densities and characterize the bionomics of An. stephensi in Ghana. The long-term goal
is to develop evidence-based sampling tools for systematic An. stephensi surveillance to enable sensitive
detection of invasion events, track the spread, and facilitate the evaluation of intervention measures. To achieve
this objective, two specific aims have been designed. In aim 1, we will systematically evaluate sampling methods
for An. stephensi and other native malaria vectors in heterogeneous urban environments. This aim will provide
data on the extent of the spread of An. stephensi and the efficient sampling tools for An. stephensi. This data
will give a better understanding of the gaps in protection, optimizing present strategies and supplemental
strategies needed to mitigate invasions. In aim 2, we will determine the extent of An. stephensi spread and
population dynamics of malaria vectors in sentinel sites in Ghana. Data from this will provide a better
understanding of the extent of spread and the mechanisms that regulate An. stephensi breeding and productivity.
Overall, data from these aims will increase our understanding of the most appropriate sampling methods for the
surveillance, the extent of spread and factors that regulate An. stephensi and native vector populations in urban
cities in Ghana. It will also provide evidence for the most efficient intervention strategies that may be particularly
effective against these invasive species."

Recently there has been compelling evidence that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) subjects, both Crohn's
disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), commonly have disrupted sleep, and disrupted sleep correlates with
the risk of disease flare. Sleep/wake cycle, immune function, metabolism and multiple biological processes are
all orchestrated by circadian rhythms. Circadian misalignment between the central circadian clock in the brain
and environment has been found to contribute to a variety of metabolic and gastrointestinal tract (GIT)
diseases. Yet, the prevalence and impact of circadian misalignment on IBD disease activity and GIT mucosal
inflammation have not been established. The long-term objective of our research is to investigate the
hypothesis that circadian malalignment worsens GIT mucosal inflammation and disease course in IBD. To test
this hypothesis, we will conduct a prospective in lab study with human subjects on the impact of circadian
misalignment in left sided mild to moderate Ulcerative Colitis. We will perform two circadian measures phase
assessments under strictly controlled laboratory conditions at: 1) baseline, and after 2) circadian misalignment
after three days of simulated night shifts in both inactive UC patients and healthy control subjects. To test the
hypothesis that UC patients (compared to healthy subject controls) are less resilient to circadian misalignment
we will assess: time impact of our protocol on circadian rhythms (Aim 1) by the following: phase angle of
entrainment [time from dim light melatonin onset to sleep onset] (Aim1a); peripheral circadian rhythms by
clock gene expression in colonic tissue from a flexible sigmoidoscopy and in subjects peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (Aim1b); and colonic clock gene expression and Per2::Luc activity over 24 hours utilizing an
in-vitro model of colonic organoids (Aim1c). Next, we will test the hypothesis that circadian misalignment will
increase colonic permeability and mucosal inflammation in UC patients (vs. Controls) (Aim2) through the
following: endoscopy score, stool calprotectin, colonic barrier (permeability, AJC proteins), and markers of
systemic barrier function and inflammation (Aim 2a); adversely impacting microbial community
structure/function (Aim 2b); and use 2D colonic organoid monolayers to explore ex-vivo barrier function by co-
culturing with TNF-α/INF-γ (Aim 2c). The results of this innovative proposal will greatly increase our
understanding of the important role circadian misalignment may have in UC disease activity and colonic
inflammation, and identify new circadian regulated targets for treatment in UC."
10953174,"Racial disparities among older adults in diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and mortality
have widened, in part due to economic recessions such as the Great Recession (2008-2009).
The Great Recession disproportionately worsened employment disruptions including precarious
employment, health, and survival for Black relative to White workers. Population health research
on employment-related health consequences of the Great Recession however do not address
vulnerability of prior exposure to precarious employment, leaving a knowledge gap regarding the
extent to which precarity during an economic recession maybe superimposed on prior work
precarity. This cumulative precarity could exacerbate health disparities for older workers.
Economic recessions also deteriorate psychosocial working conditions among those who remain
employed. It, however, remains unclear how psychosocial work conditions such as job strain
during an economic recession, influence health and mortality when they occur together with
cumulative precarity. The objective of this project, therefore, is to assess how pre-recession and
successive Great Recession precarity cumulatively shaped employment and work conditions for
older Black and White workers, and along with psychosocial working conditions impacted health
biomarker trajectories and mortality. I will use 2006-2018 data from the 1) Health and Retirement
Study (HRS) and 2) HRS- linked Occupational Information Network Data (O*NET) data to
examine the following 3 specific aims: 1) Examine Black-White differences in the independent
and co-occurring effects of pre-recession (2006) and Great Recession (2008-2010) precarity on
trajectories (2012-2018) of diabetes and CVD biomarkers (hbA1c, cholesterol, C-reactive protein,
and systolic blood pressure) and all-cause mortality, 2) Among those who remain employed during
the Great Recession, examine Black-White differences in the association of psychosocial work
conditions (job strain) with trajectories of diabetes and CVD biomarkers and all-cause mortality,
while accounting for cumulative precarity, and 3) Examine whether gender moderates
associations observed in Aims 1 and 2. This project is timely, and provides an opportunity to
explore and understand these issues as the remnants of the COVID-19 economic recession
persist, with additional and disproportionate insults on both employment and health in Blacks, the
full extent of which will not be fully elucidated for years to come. An understanding of these
associations is important to inform appropriate policies aimed at building social and health safety
nets for older workers approaching and preparing for retirement."

10952173,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The diarrheal disease shigellosis impacts 80-165 million individuals and causes an estimated 600,000 deaths
worldwide each year, primarily among children, and no effective vaccines are available. The human gut
microbiome is suspected to play a role in protection against Shigella infection, yet this is largely undefined. We
propose to investigate the role of the human gut microbiome in protection against Shigella both in a novel
mouse model and in culture.
Human challenge studies with Shigella have identified individuals resistant to infection, even among people
assumed to be naive to the pathogen. We will use stool samples collected from humans prior to Shigella
challenge to characterize microbiomes that are sensitive and resistant to Shigella challenge. We will perform
metagenomic sequencing to identify features of interest and transplant these communities into germ-free mice.
We will use Shigella susceptible mice deficient in the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome to establish a novel
humanized mouse model for shigellosis and identify factors driving microbiome-mediated protection.
Our preliminary data suggests that specific human bacterial strains can decrease S. flexneri colonization, but
are not as effective as complex human microbiomes, which can provide full protection. We will further
characterize bacterial mechanisms inhibiting Shigella growth and virulence in culture using diverse gut
bacterial culture collections and multiple experimental approaches.
New therapeutic strategies are essential for future prevention and treatment of Shigella given the expansion of
antibiotic resistant strains. This proposal will identify key bacterial species important for Shigella resistance that
can pave the way for microbial therapeutics and prophylactic regimens in high-risk individuals, including
children. It will also establish for the first time a Shigella susceptible mouse model with a human microbiome,
enabling new avenues of research into gut microbiome-Shigella interactions."
10952172,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Understanding mechanisms of drug action is important for identifying settings in which a drug will be effective,
and for interpreting – even predicting – potential mechanisms of drug resistance. For anti-cancer drugs, a key
aspect of their mechanism of action is the mechanism by which these drugs promote cell death. The first
identified death pathway was apoptosis, a form of death that is now reasonably understood. In addition, it has
long been known that cells can also die in non-apoptotic ways. The conventional wisdom had been that these
necrotic forms of death are not regulated; that is, that they do not result from activation of defined signaling
cascades or use of specific effector molecules. It is now clear that this traditional thinking is incorrect. Several
distinct forms of regulated necrosis have now been identified. As the definition of regulated cell death has
expanded, so has our understanding that anti-cancer drugs generally have the capacity to activate multiple
types of cell death. The exact composition of death types, and how/why these vary across contexts remains
challenging to study due to the lack of tools for simultaneously evaluating all mechanisms of cell death from a
single sample. To address these issues, we propose to develop a targeted sgRNA library that can be used to
infer which type of death is activated in vivo. This proposal focuses on the development, optimization, and
failure testing of this new tool, to establish the utility and resolution limits of this method. Our tool will be
evaluated in the context of drugs that inhibit histone deacetylases (HDACs), which we have previously found to
induce varied forms of cell death across doses and environments. The methods developed in this proposal
have the potential to be transformative by providing the first insights into the mechanisms of regulation for
many understudied types of necrotic death and by enabling new studies that explore how these mechanisms
vary across dose, time, and disease contexts."

Abstract
Diarrhea is a leading cause of death among children under five years of age worldwide. This problem
is particularly acute in low and middle income (LMIC) countries where access to clean water, vaccines
and medical care may be limited. Enteric human viruses, including adenovirus, astrovirus, norovirus,
rotavirus and sapovirus are major causes of diarrheal incidence, morbidity and mortality along with
bacteria and protozoa. Effective vaccines are needed for all of these viruses since the current rotavirus
vaccine is not highly effective in LMIC and there are no approved vaccines for other enteric human
viruses. Our primary goal is to discover specific antibody correlates of protection from infant viral
diarrhea caused by these five viruses. We hypothesize that the antigens we identify will be excellent
vaccine candidates for maternal and pediatric immunization. We will analyze the correlates of protection
from gastroenteritis among the enteric virus antibody specificities found in breast milk, maternal sera
and 18 week and one year old infant serum using an enteric virus protein microarray that we will
construct. The array will contain all proteins and protein fragments from the five most common viral
causes of diarrhea. The results will guide the development of vaccines against these important human
pathogens."
10952832,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Spina bifida (SB) is a viable type of neural tube defect (NTD), the second most prevalent birth defect in humans.
The genetic and environmental factors combinatorically contribute to the etiology of SB. Neuromesodermal
progenitors (NMPs) are the precursors of spinal neural tubes (SNT), yet how genetic modification and teratogen
affect NMP-mediated SNT formation is largely unknown. Model organisms have been widely used to study the
effects of genetic and environmental factors on SB. Still, they have limitations in fully recapitulating human NTDs
due to their different genetic backgrounds and subsequent drug sensitivity. Significant progress on in vitro 3D
SNT organoids has been made, yet they did not fully recapitulate the in vivo spatiotemporal microenvironment
to study the gene-environment interaction. Here, we will investigate the complex interplay between the genetic
predisposition and teratogen in NMP-mediated human SNT formation using human induced pluripotent stem
cells (hiPSCs) that recreate three-dimensional (3D) SNT organoids to fill the current scientific gaps. We will
further develop a bioengineered Spinal Neural Tube-on-a-chip (SNT Chip) model to recapitulate the
spatiotemporal microenvironment by controlling microfluidic modules to fulfill the technical gaps. Our preliminary
study supported that GPR161 has a strong genetic association with human and mouse SB and NMPs are
involved in GPR161-mediated SNT formation in mice. We will utilize GPR161 KO iPSCs-induced 3D SNT
organoids as a human-relevant SB model to investigate how GPR161 genetic modification and its interaction
with teratogens (Vismodegib and Valproic acid) affect NMP-mediated human SNT formation in both the static 3D
human SNT organoids and an SNT-Chip. This will verify how the spatiotemporal modulations with biomechanical
cues regulate the human SNT formation and the subsequent cellular and molecular profiles of human SNTs
compared to the static 3D organoid cultures. We anticipate enhancing the scientific knowledge of gene-
environmental interactions on human SNT formation and advancing the in vitro modeling of a human SNT system
with in vivo-relevant microenvironmental milieu."

The increasing aging population presents a heightened risk of neurodegenerative diseases.
Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is one of these disorders and is the most common dementia in those under 60,
results from genetic mutations, particularly GGGGCC(G4C2) hexanucleotide repeat expansions in the
C9orf72 gene. These mutations, normally occurring 2-30 times in healthy individuals, can extend to hundreds
or thousands in C9orf72-related FTD and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients. TMEM106B is another
gene that is linked with neurodegeneration and particularly FTD and codes for a transmembrane protein
localized to the lysosome. Genome Wide Association Studies have shown single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) within the TMEM106B gene confer risk for various neurodegenerative disorders. It has been
shown that TMEM106B asks as a genetic modifier for C9orf72-related FTD. This dissertation proposal
delves into the complex interaction between TMEM106B and C9orf72 by examining the interplay between
TMEM106B and GA, a dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins produced by C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat
expansions. My preliminary data shows increased C-terminal cleavage of TMEM106B when co-expressed
with GA. Thus, I hypothesize that GA interacts with TMEM106B through its perturbation of the
proteosome pathway which in turn perturbs the clearance of a TMEM106B C-terminal cleaved product
and subsequently leads to neurotoxicity. This proposal also intends to investigate the toxicity of
TMEM106B aggregate prone fibrils. These fibrils were found in patients with different
neurodegenerative disorder as well as aged individuals while absent in young disordered and control
individuals. Individuals with risk SNPs have higher burden of TMEM106B fibrils which suggests a central
role in aging and neurodegeneration. Preliminary data shows that TMEM106B overexpression leads to
neurotoxicity as well as subsequent mislocalization of nuclear RNA binding proteins (RBPs). Thus, I
will test the hypothesis that TMEM106B fibrils play an important role in neurodegeneration and
contribute to toxicity and disease pathogenesis through disruption of the NCT. The Specific Aims of
this project are to: 1) Determine the interaction of TMEM106B and C9orf72 repeat expansion; and 2)
Determine the toxicity of TMEM106B fibrils and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Successful
completion of the proposed Aims will provide insights into TMEM106B’s interaction with C9orf72
and TMEM106B fibril’s contribution to aging and disease."

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infections such as Mycobacterium abscessus (Mabs) are a
growing health concern, particularly in older and immunocompromised patient populations, and
are among the most difficult bacterial infections to eradicate. Thus, there remains a critical need
to understand the mechanisms enabling Mabs to survive prolonged exposure to lethal antibiotics.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that antibiotic tolerance is a regulated process,
controlled by pathways that sense discrete stresses, and transduce signals leading to a
coordinated cellular response that mitigates antibiotic cytotoxicity. In our preliminary data we
present the results of a Tn-Seq screen to identify genes contributing to antibiotic tolerance. We

 My long-term career goal is to become a translational researcher who uses rodent models and human
samples to facilitate innovative interventions that readily adapt to the clinic. The current proposal represents an
important step in my transition to scientific independence, and will significantly extend my training in behavioral
and developmental neuroscience, as well as provide new training in bioinformatics and translational research.
These training activities will occur within the context of a timely public health crisis seen with the opioid
epidemic. Children born to opioid-abusing mothers, including mothers stabilized on medication-assisted
treatment (MAT), are at an increased risk for cognitive deficits that frequently display as problems with
executive function (e.g., inattention, impulsivity). Work in an animal model is necessary to 1) identify the
mechanisms underlying executive function deficits in order to develop treatment strategies and 2) control for
unavoidable confounds seen in the clinic (e.g., polysubstance use). Currently there are no animal studies of
executive function after maternal opioid use and the present proposal seeks to fill this gap. Further, to
understand potential biological mechanisms, we will use an unbiased, hypothesis-driving bioinformatics
approach to discover offspring molecular signatures of maternal opioid use. Overall, the current proposal will
test the hypothesis that maternal opioid exposure, including MAT, causes executive function deficits in
adulthood that are associated with transcriptional changes within the prefrontal cortex, an area of the brain
vulnerable to environmental exposures and important for executive function.
 Specific Aim 1 (mentored phase) will examine executive function in opioid-exposed offspring, including
MAT, using the 5 choice serial reaction time task. This training will extend my expertise in developmental and
behavioral neuroscience. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that maternal opioid exposure, including
MAT, creates gene expression signatures in the prefrontal cortex that relate to executive function deficits, and
will include training (mentored phase; certificate program in Bioinformatics) and experiments (independent
phase; RNA-seq of brains from Aim 1). I will use bioinformatics strategies to integrate RNA sequencing data
and complex executive function behavioral data. Specific Aim 3 (mentored phase) will test the hypothesis that
in humans, maternal opioid exposure produces distinct epigenomic signatures that are detectable in human
DNA samples. This will take advantage of unique access to human samples from both opioid-exposed and
non-exposed children, as well as access to their paired electronic health records. This will provide critical
training in working with clinical samples and is a key aspect of my training in translational research. My training
will be further supported by regular meetings with an expert Advisory Committee, and completion of graduate
certificates in both Biomedical Informatics and Clinical & Translational Research."
10952103,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors have demonstrated efficient gene transduction in preclinical
gene therapy studies and are approved for clinical use in the US. Although we know the relevant viral genes
that facilitate rAAV replication and packaging, we have very little understanding of the cellular proteins required
to facilitate AAV replication. We also know very few of the host cell interactions with the vector genome which
impact the efficiency of rAAV transduction in target cells. Recruitment of cellular proteins to AAV genomes
promotes replication in producer cells, whereas host antiviral factors limit rAAV transduction in target cells.
Production of rAAV vectors and their use for transduction and gene therapy will benefit from a deeper
understanding of the cellular factors that interact with AAV genomes to facilitate gene expression, DNA
replication, genome encapsidation, and vector transduction. In this proposal we aim to identify cellular factors
that associate with AAV genomes. Knowledge of proteins that interact with AAV genomes will be harnessed to
improve both rAAV production and effective gene delivery. We will employ a novel proteomics technology that
identifies proteins on replicating DNA by coupling Isolation of Proteins on Nascent DNA (iPOND) with Mass
Spectrometry (MS). Our lab has extensive experience using iPOND-MS to identify cellular factors on replicating
viral DNA genomes, with existing experimental and bioinformatic pipelines for acquiring these proteomics data
and analyzing results. We are the first to employ iPOND-MS for AAV, and our preliminary data demonstrate
feasibility with an innovative approach to label AAV genomes. In Aim 1 we will adapt the iPOND-MS technique
to identify cellular factors associated with replicating wild-type AAV genomes. We will optimize labeling of AAV
genomes and identification of associated proteins, and determine their impact on AAV replication. In Aim 2 we
will identify cellular proteins associated specifically with DNA genomes of rAAV vectors. We will employ iPOND-
MS to define proteins on replicating rAAV genomes in producer cells. We will also label rAAV vector genomes
and define factors associated with labeled genomes during rAAV transduction of target cells. We will use cellular
assays to determine the impact of these host proteins on rAAV transduction. In this way we anticipate that our
results will identify the cellular factors associated with rAAV genomes that regulate both vector production and
efficient transduction of target cells. This knowledge will suggest ways that production and transduction can be
improved. This application is based on innovative proteomics methodology we have developed to identify the
repertoire of proteins associated with DNA of viral genomes. Our combined expertise and reagents make us
ideally suited for this project which has the potential to provide insights into cellular factors that can be harnessed
to improve AAV replication during rAAV vector production and gene expression during rAAV vector transduction."

Recent clinical and preclinical studies have shown that seizures can adversely interact with brain tumors to sƟmulate tumor
cell proliferaƟon and invasion. Moreover, posƟctal hypoperfusion can give rise to hypoxia-driven radiaƟon resistance and
convenƟonal anƟ-seizure drugs can limit the efficacy of chemotherapeuƟc agents. CollecƟvely, these factors complicate
the clinical management of these paƟents and degrade their quality of life (QOL). Therefore, an understanding of the
physiology underlying the “seizure-brain tumor nexus” is crucial for treaƟng brain cancer paƟents and enhancing their
QOL. However, brain tumor associated seizures occur at random, creaƟng a major obstacle for studying them with standard
imaging technologies (e.g., fMRI/PET) which only offer a few hours of imaging. While EEG can circumvent this problem, it
does not provide the spaƟal specificity required to parse the seizure-tumor nexus. AddiƟonally, most imaging technologies
also require anesthesia, which confounds the assessment of seizure-induced hemodynamic (i.e. blood flow and
oxygenaƟon) abnormaliƟes. These hurdles limit our ability to image the seizure-brain tumor nexus in vivo and elucidate
the interacƟons between seizure-induced neuronal hyperexcitaƟons, posƟctal hypoxia, tumor cell proliferaƟon and
mobilizaƟon. To address these issues, we propose to develop a new class of remotely controlled, cloud-based,
mulƟcontrast miniaturized microscopes called “NeuroVu” for characterizing the seizure-brain tumor nexus without Ɵme
constraints in unanestheƟzed or freely behaving animals. NeuroVu will be capable of real-Ɵme dual channel fluorescence
(dual-FL), dual intrinsic opƟcal signal (dual-IOS) and laser speckle contrast (LSC) imaging to enable conƟnuous in vivo
“neurosurveillance” by imaging both, the seizure-associated hyperexcited neurovascular unit and its interacƟons with
proliferaƟng brain tumor cells. A variant of NeuroVu (NeuroVuopto) will be capable of optogeneƟc-based inhibiƟon of

10948374,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 HIV remains a major global health burden, in large part because of its massive evolutionary potential to
rapidly evolve escape mutations even from multi-drug therapies. This potential has also allowed HIV to evade
the suite of human cell-intrinsic restriction factors that represent the ﬁrst line of immune defense against infection.
In particular, the viral capsid is a critical target of cell-intrinsic immunity, yet human capsid-targeting proteins like
TRIM5⍺, MxB, and TRIM34 have almost no ability to inhibit HIV. Although viral sequencing identiﬁes the many
capsid mutations sampled by natural isolates, it cannot help to parse the selective pressures that drove this suite
of mutations. For example, there is limited information on which capsid mutations allow escape from human
restriction factors, and which mutations are disallowed for interaction with virus-required host factors. This
knowledge gap leaves us with little insight into the mechanism of capsid targeting by restriction factors, and
insufﬁcient information to design capsid-targeting therapies that can evolutionarily “box in” the virus to prevent
simultaneous escape from therapies and native restriction factors. This proposal will ﬁll this knowledge gap by
comprehensively deﬁning these selective pressures for the HIV-1 capsid, using a high throughput saturating
mutagenesis approach. This approach relies on the targeted introduction of all possible single missense
mutations at all positions in the HIV-1 capsid, followed by direct measurement of their ﬁtness under different
cellular conditions. Using innovative new tools to overcome long-standing technical barriers to the stable
production of HIV-1 viral libraries, this proposal will apply saturation mutagenesis to determine the landscape of
all deleterious or allowed capsid mutations for completion of the viral life cycle as well as sensitivity to human
restriction factors. These data will comprehensively deﬁne the capsid surfaces and biochemical moieties
recognized by multiple ﬁrst-line immune defense proteins, which has eluded deﬁnition despite decades of study.
Moreover, these data will open a new avenue for designing HIV drug therapies with an evolutionary lens; this
work will identify Achille's heels of the HIV capsid, which can be targeted by therapies such that viral escape will
necessarily sensitize it to immune defense."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a highly prevalent disorder affecting over 8 million individuals worldwide. T1D causes
significant morbidity and mortality, including acute complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis as well as
chronic complications such as nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease. Developing a
deeper understanding of T1D risk factors is critical to reduce diabetes-related complications, to identify
individuals at high risk for T1D, and potentially to delay or to prevent the onset of T1D.
Because T1D is characterized by autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells, T1D risk is strongly
influenced by genetic variants related to immune function. Genetic risk for T1D can be quantified with a
polygenic score, which integrates the disease risk of causal variants from across the genome. Current
polygenic scores have demonstrated excellent predictive power to identify those individuals most likely to
develop T1D. However, most existing scores were developed and validated in individuals with European
genetic ancestry, and their predictive power declines when applied to other populations.
In this proposal, we will develop a multi-ancestry T1D polygenic score that integrates genetic variants from
diverse ancestral populations. We will apply this score to predict risk for T1D as well as for certain atypical
immune-mediated forms of diabetes, which may share genetic risk factors with T1D. Additionally, we will apply
computational methods that analyze T1D genetic risk factors to identify genetic subtypes of T1D.
The proposed project will provide advanced training in computational biology and statistical genetics. The
research setting represents an ideal environment for junior investigators, combining the world-class clinical
expertise of Massachusetts General Hospital with the innovative computational resources of the Broad Institute.
This project will provide a foundation for the candidate to apply for independent research funding and ultimately
to establish a career as a physician scientist."

 The overall goal of this K23 proposal is to provide Olivia Van Gerwen, MD, MPH with the necessary mentorship
and career development to become an independent investigator whose work will contribute to decreasing sexual
health disparities faced by transgender and gender diverse (TGD) populations. The focus of her research will be
on the vaginal health of transgender men (TGM). Testosterone can negatively impact the vaginal health of TGM
by thinning the vaginal epithelium and leading to atrophic vaginitis and vaginal dysbiosis. In addition to symptoms
(e.g., irritation, discharge, odor, dyspareunia), these changes can increase the risk of HIV and sexually
transmitted infection (STI) acquisition. Despite their significance, vaginal symptoms and infections are poorly
characterized in TGM.
 This population is underserved and have limited engagement with sexual health services, largely due to
discrimination from and mistrust of the medical establishment. Since many TGM do not undergo bottom surgery,
vaginal health is an important sexual health consideration. However, there is a critical knowledge gap in how
testosterone-prescribing healthcare providers should assess these symptoms (both through history-taking and
clinical specimen collection) in an affirming manner. Community-informed approaches are necessary to promote
more satisfactory sexual healthcare experiences for TGM and, thus, improve sexual health outcomes.
 In this study, we will perform mixed methods research to inform the development of clinical tools for use by
healthcare providers to collect both vaginal history data and clinical specimen data. This research will allow
providers to better assess and manage vaginal symptoms that TGM experience, ultimately optimizing the vaginal
health of this population and mitigating the impacts of testosterone.
Aim 1: Develop a survey instrument measuring the vaginal health of TGM on testosterone for use in clinical
settings.
Aim 2: Examine the psychometric properties of the items to finalize the instrument.
Aim 3: Characterize the acceptability and feasibility of vaginal specimen self-collection and quantify the
frequency of bacterial vaginosis (BV) among TGM on testosterone.
 With guidance from my mentorship and advisory team, I have created a training plan that will allow me to gain
expertise in mixed methods research, community engagement, and sexual and vaginal health outcomes
research through didactic coursework, hands-on training, and expert mentorship. Upon completion of the
research aims in this proposal, I will develop an R01 proposal which will utilize the tools and data generated to
develop a multi-level intervention focused on improving the patient-provider experience for TGM with vaginal
health needs."

 Adverse birth outcomes are prevalent conditions that increase the risk of morbidity and mortality during
infancy and the development of chronic metabolic diseases in adulthood. Despite being multifactorial in nature,
the causes of adverse birth outcomes, particularly concerning placental dysfunction, are not well understood.
Maternal exposure to environmental contaminants is believed to contribute to these outcomes. As a
reproductive toxicologist, Dr. Elkin's research seeks to understand the role that maternal exposure to
environmental contaminants play in contributing to adverse birth outcomes involving placental dysfunction, and
to identify mechanisms by which these aberrant effects can be mitigated or prevented. This Transition to
Independent Environmental Health Research (TIEHR) Care Award will provide Dr. Elkin the opportunity to
increase training and experience to meet: 1) research development goals, including utilization of single-nucleus
technologies and establishment of an in vitro model to represent the syncytial barrier at the maternal-fetal
interface, and 2) professional development goals, including science communication, mentoring, and
management skills. In humans, maternal exposure to the industrial solvent trichloroethylene is associated with
increased risk of low birth weight and restricted fetal growth, conditions linked to placental dysfunction. For the
research component of this project, Dr. Elkin will investigate the biological mechanisms of the trichloroethylene
metabolite S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (DCVC) contributing to restricted fetal growth by identifying
molecular factors underpinning disruption of placental function at the maternal-fetal interface. At the maternal-
fetal interface, several different cell types of trophoblast lineage have critical functions. Previously, Dr. Elkin
extensively characterized the effects of DCVC on HTR-8/SVneo cells, which model invasive extravillous
trophoblasts. Nevertheless, toxic effects on other important cell types at the maternal-fetal interface have not
been explored. Recently, Dr. Elkin's colleagues published promising preliminary data showing that DCVC
caused aberrant apoptosis, oxidative stress and inflammation in differentiated BeWo cells, a cell line that
models the interhaemal barrier of multinucleated syncytiotrophoblasts separating maternal and fetal
circulations. Using an in vitro approach, Dr. Elkin's project will expand on compelling preliminary data by: (1)
identifying other placental cell types vulnerable to DCVC at the maternal fetal interface using single-nucleus
RNA-sequencing (2) examining DCVC effects on mitochondrial energetics of differentiated
syncytiotrophoblasts and (3) determining if DCVC affects placental villous barrier function. The proposed
research will address the NIEHS goal of “advancing scientific understanding of the role that early exposure to
environmental contaminants play in impacting disease risk later in life.” The findings will inform various
stakeholders including lawmakers tasked with protecting the public and clinicians developing therapeutic
interventions to combat elevated risk of untoward complications, ultimately improving maternal/fetal outcomes."

modeling, and (3) design of prospective clinical protocols and grantsmanship.
 Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) is a rare subtype of Hodgkin
lymphoma that is most commonly treated with intensive chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy.
The majority of patients have excellent outcomes but their survival can be threatened by secondary
toxicities including cardiotoxicities. To reduce therapy associated morbidity and mortality through
de-escalation of therapy by identifying low risk patients and those at high risk of cardiotoxicity, this
proposal seeks to (1) describe cell state ecosystems predictive of outcome, (2) use circulating tumor
DNA to genotype NLPHL and establish its utility as a surveillance tool for those with advanced
stage disease, and (3) establish noninvasive testing of inherited coronary artery disease risk. This
proposal will lay the foundation for future prospective clinical trials employing microenvironmental
factors to select patients suitable for therapy de-escalation."

Genome-wide association studies have uncovered thousands of disease-associated variants that localize to
noncoding genomic regions and influence disease risk through altered cis (local) and trans (distal) gene
regulation. Though cis regulatory variation has been extensively characterized across many cell and tissue types,
trans regulatory effects are more challenging to ascertain. Trans regulation is partly mediated by transcription
factors (TFs), a class of proteins that have widespread influence on gene regulatory networks. Regulatory
elements containing TF binding sites are enriched for complex disease heritability. Interestingly, many early
onset, highly penetrant monogenic diseases are caused by coding variation in the same TFs that are implicated
in complex diseases. Together, this suggests that a shared set of regulatory networks underlies a subset of
common, complex diseases and rare, monogenic diseases. The goal of this project is to uncover regulatory
networks controlled by monogenic disease-associated TFs and decipher their involvement in processes that
drive complex disease phenotypes. In Aim 1 (K99), I will perform a low-throughput arrayed CRISPR screen
targeting 13 monogenic diabetes TFs, use detailed genomic profiles (RNA-seq for gene expression, ATAC-seq
for chromatin accessibility, and CUT&Tag for histone modifications) with integrative machine learning
approaches to construct regulatory networks, and incorporate human genetics data to infer how genetic variation
propagates through layers of regulatory information. The focus of Aim 2 (K99) is to develop a novel method to
jointly characterize the effects of coding variants in transcription factors and noncoding variants in their cognate
motifs to construct a comprehensive regulatory interface map. After transitioning to the R00 independent phase,
I will apply the approaches developed in Aims 1 and 2 to examine the influence of cell type and stimulation on
variant effects and network structure in Aim 3. Collectively, these aims will reveal the fundamental gene
regulatory networks underlying phenotypes shared by common polygenic and rare monogenic diseases and
provide insight into mechanisms by which disease-associated genetic variation exerts its influence. The specific
methods and frameworks developed will be broadly applicable to other comparable complex and monogenic
diseases beyond those explored here. To achieve these research objectives, my mentors Dr. Stephen Parker
(human genetics and genomics) and Jacob Kitzman (genomic technologies) and I have outlined a
comprehensive training plan. To aid with this plan, we have assembled a world-class mentorship committee with
diverse expertise in large-scale functional genomics screens (Drs. Melina Claussnitzer and Anna Gloyn),
machine learning (Dr. Anshul Kundaje), and human genetics (Drs. Michael Boehnke and Karen Mohlke). I will
also receive training in state-of-the-art human organoid culture systems from collaborator Dr. Jason Spence.
The excellent training plan and mentorship team will collectively support my research and career training, and
later facilitate my transition to independence."

Conformational variations in α-syn fibrils are proposed to be implicated in the emergence of distinct diseases
within synucleinopathies, including Lewy body dementia (LBD), Parkinsons’s disease (PD), and multiple system
atrophy (MSA), suggesting a molecular fingerprint closely connected to clinical diagnosis. However, the
mechanisms underlying the appearance of these disease-specific conformations and their impact on the
progression of distinct pathologies in synucleinopathies remain largely unclear. Motivated by the existing
knowledge gap between structural polymorphism and disease entities, the goal of this proposed research is to
investigate how α-syn pathology propagates in a disease-specific manner, by focusing on the molecular
interactions between α-syn fibril structures and diverse cellular environments. To achieve this, we will employ a
multidisciplinary approach based on the combination of biophysical approach, molecular biology, and human
organ-on-a-chip technology. Building upon our complementary expertise in neurodegenerative amyloid fibril
research and human organ-chip development, we will produce various forms of α-syn fibril seeds, characterize
their conformations, and investigate their functions in human vascularized brain-on-chips with an unprecedented
physiological realism. The central hypothesis posits that the membrane-mediated polymorphisms of α-syn fibrils
are a key factor in the emergence of the distinctive pathological features of synucleinopathies, including LBD
and PD, through the molecular interactions between α-syn fibrils and cellular membranes. These interactions
are significantly influenced by the distinct conformations of α-syn fibrils and the varying membrane conditions
found in different types of brain cells. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Generate
the polymorphic α-syn fibrils in the presence of various physiologically relevant membranes and characterize
their functional properties; 2) Create microengineered 3D culture arrays for on-chip production of vascularized
human mid-brain tissues and validate the propagation of α-syn pathology; and 3) Explore the cell-type specific
pathological impacts of lipid-associated polymorphic α-syn fibrils and compare the molecular structures and
interactions of these polymorphic α-syn fibrils. The expected outcomes will provide novel insights into the
molecular mechanisms underlying conformation-dependent neuropathology. Consequently, these findings will
contribute to the design and development of small molecules aimed at either inhibiting aggregations or detecting
neurotoxic aggregates. Additionally, the brain-on-a-chip established in this study has the potential to serve as a
promising drug screening platform capable of faithfully replicating cellular responses to pharmaceutical agents.
Ultimately, this study will aid in the development of advanced diagnostic and therapeutic approaches aimed at
synucleinopathies, thereby mitigating the adverse impacts of neurodegenerative disorders on public health and
societal functioning."

The G-protein Gb3 subunit encoded by the gene GNB3, is the protein present in multiple tissues
and cell types, including retinal cone photoreceptors, as part of the Gabg heterotrimers
responsible for the intracellular signaling initiated by the G-protein-coupled receptors, GPCRs.
There is evidence that mutations in GNB3 are associated with cardiovascular disease, metabolic
syndrome, obesity and visual impairment. Rare GNB3 mutations have been found associated
with retinal degeneration and congenital stationary night blindness. The mechanisms of these
pathophysiological conditions linked to GNB3 are poorly understood. In the retina, there is little
understanding of why members of the same gene family GNB3 and GNB1 are expressed
selectively in cone and rod photoreceptors, and what roles Gb3 and Gb1, in tight complexes with
the corresponding Gg subunit, Ggc and Gg1, contribute to the distinct properties of cone and rod
phototransduction and retinal diseases.
This pilot proposal focuses on the initial characterization of a unique mouse model that our
laboratory has developed to replace the entire rod Gb1g1 subunit complex with its cone analogue
Gb3gc. The proposal aims to collect critical preliminary data for a more comprehensive project
focusing on the specificity of retinal signaling and mechanisms of retinal disorders involving Gnb3.
This project builds the necessary foundation for further mechanistic studies of specific human
mutations, as well as the development of new therapeutic approaches."
10953109,"The sense of taste is mediated by taste buds on the tongue. Each bud is a heterogeneous collection of taste
receptor cells (TRCs), and all TRCs, which transduce sweet, bitter, salt, sour and umami tastes, are continually
renewed from adult stem cells outside of taste buds. However, taste function can be perturbed by numerous
insults, including drugs and viral infection that affect TRC renewal.
 Ex vivo organoids are now a conventional method for study of cellular and molecular mechanisms of adult
epithelial homeostasis, e.g., intestine. We and others have recently established this technology for the taste
system, where isolated stem cells from the circumvallate taste papilla (CVP) of adult mice are cultured to
generate TRC-containing lingual organoids; this model is used increasingly to study the impact of drugs and
pathogens on taste homeostasis. While informative, however, results in mice may not precisely reflect how
taste is perturbed in patients. Therefore, here we proposed to establish human TRC-replete lingual organoid
lines from CVPs obtained postmortem from organ donors as a first step in developing human in vitro models.
 Our strategy overcomes several logistical and technical barriers to production of lingual organoids in
humans. 1. We now have a pipeline to obtain CVP biopsies through a non-profit organ and tissue procurement
organization. 2. We are expert at mouse lingual organoids and will apply our skill to human tissue. 3. We will
work closely with our Organoid and Tissue Modelling Core, who have already created organoid lines from
human postmortem donor pancreas and intestine.
Aim 1. Validate and characterize CVP samples in male and female human donor tissue. Humans have
multiple, easily visible CVPs. Initially, PSR staff will process harvested biopsies to verify CVPs are reliably
obtained. Subsequently, TRC and stem cell marker gene expression will be assessed via q-PCR, in situ
hybridization (ISH) and/or immunofluorescence (IF). We will perform single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-
seq) of fresh male and female biopsies to transcriptionally profile CVP epithelial cell populations, identify
differentially expressed genes in human TRCs and stem cells, and construct lineage models.
Aim 2. Establish human lingual organoids from CVP biopsies. Initially, small tissue pieces of CVPs will be
cultured under our mouse lingual organoid protocol. Organoids will be assessed for TRC and stem cell marker
gene expression via qPCR, ISH and IF as in Aim 1. The organoid protocol will be modified as necessary;
permutations may include differences in treatment of starting material, plating density, culture media
components, and duration of culture. Once TRC-replete organoids are produced reliably, organoid lines from
at least 2 female and 2 male donors will be maintained through serial passage and storage of frozen stocks.
Additionally, we will perform scRNA-seq of 1 male and 1 female organoid line for bioinformatic comparison
with CVP datasets obtained in Aim 1."
10947659,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a major challenge in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs),
resulting in prolonged hospital stays, and preventable morbidity and mortality. Infections in the NICU are more
likely to be resistant, with the most common infections being central line-associated bloodstream infections,
surgical site infections, skin and soft tissue infections, and pneumonia. Current approaches to understanding
HAI and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are largely dependent on bacterial culture, which may fail to detect
carriage of outbreak-associated pathogens, and which can be falsely negative in the setting of antibiotic pre-
treatment or fastidious organisms. In contrast, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) offers a more
comprehensive view of the neonatal microbiome, including viral and bacterial microbes, and the associated AMR
genes. These proposed aims will evaluate the potential of mNGS surveillance to provide novel insights into
pathogen transmission and AMR acquisition, thereby better informing hospital infection prevention and AMR
control strategies.
 This proposal leverages mNGS to study a prospective cohort of NICU patients sampled weekly with nasal
and skin swabs, paired with weekly environmental surface swabs of patient rooms to study the dynamic
exchange of pathogens and AMR genes in the NICU with the following specific aims: Aim 1: Identify nosocomial
transmission of viral and bacterial pathogens in the NICU through prospective mNGS surveillance of the nasal
and skin microbiome. Aim 2: Characterize the microbiome and the associated AMR genes of environmental
surfaces in patient rooms and assess the microbial exchange between patients and their surroundings. Aim 3:
Determine the impact of antibiotic exposures on the neonatal nasal and skin microbiome and the associated
AMR genes. Findings from this research will provide critical preliminary data to support future R01-funded
investigations including: 1) utilizing mNGS for real-time pathogen surveillance in healthcare settings to enable
more timely infection prevention interventions, and 2) validating AMR findings through a multi-center study to
inform antimicrobial stewardship priorities.
 The candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independently funded physician-scientist
specializing in advanced genomic and metagenomic technologies to address the dual public health threats of
HAI and AMR. The research is well supported by collaborations with UCSF's Medicine and Pediatric Infectious
Disease Divisions, the Hospital Epidemiology and Infection Prevention program, and the Chan-Zuckerberg
Biohub. Through this K23 award, the candidate will receive practical and didactic training in study design,
biospecimen management, computational analysis of high-dimensional metagenomic data, and infection
prevention, enabling the candidate to establish a unique research niche focused on harnessing mNGS
technology to inform and enhance infection prevention and AMR control strategies."

 Renal cell cancer (RCC) is a lethal disease whose incidence is on the rise. Clear cell renal cell cancer
(ccRCC), the most aggressive and the deadliest variant of this cancer, accounts for ~ 85% of all RCC cases.
While significant advances in treatment approaches have been achieved, two distinct groups of patients are at
risk of death from kidney cancer: those who present with metastatic disease and those who recur following
surgery. In the past decade, the landscape of immunotherapeutic approaches with the focus on use of
cytokines for advanced ccRCC has expanded rapidly. Specifically, cytokines can play pivotal roles in
numerous therapeutic regimens by acting on every phase of the cancer immunity cycle. The
immunotherapeutic potential of cytokines has been demonstrated to show promising results to treat various
cancers including ccRCC. This resulted in the growing number of clinical trials that explore cytokine-based
drugs, not only as single agents, but also in combination with other drugs. Thus, therapeutic potential of IL-21
as a novel treatment option for patients with advanced ccRCC has been evaluated in phase 1 and 2 clinical
trials. Despite promising anti-tumor effects, severe dose-limiting toxicities of systemic administration of IL-21
were frequently reported in clinical trials and resulted in one trial discontinuation, or moderate clinical efficacy
in others. Therefore, future cytokine-based approaches require optimization of their pharmacokinetic profiles to
increase the half-life and concentrations in the tumor microenvironment thereby minimizing their off-target
systemic effects.
 In this exploratory R21 proposal, we outline a novel approach to treat ccRCC aiming to: (i) tumor-specific
targeting of a novel engineered IL21 based immunocytokine with superior PK/PD properties; (ii) limit side-
effects frequently seen with systemic IL-21 administration; and (iii) significantly reduce FcγRs-mediated off-
target toxicity. We have designed and generated for the first time a novel immunocytokine, a humanized anti-
CD70-IL-21 fusion antibody (Ab-IL21). This antibody simultaneously binds CD70, a ligand that is specifically
expressed in ccRCC, and enhances NK cells cytotoxicity against ccRCC. Importantly, disruption of heparin
binding activity by our new IL-21 protein results in significant improvement of PK/PD properties and shows
markedly decreased hepatotoxicity of Ab-IL21 fusion antibody.
 We will focus on the design and deployment of novel, Ab-IL21 with highest affinity to IL-21R. We will also
determine the most effective tumor-specific protease cleavable linker for the fusion of anti-CD70 antibody and
IL-21 to fully release IL-21 and induce anti-CD70 mediated ADCC specifically within the RCC tumor
microenvironment. To test our hypothesis and to validate the therapeutic value of Ab-IL21, we propose the
following Specific Aims: (1) Development of the leading Ab-IL21 fusion with superior IL21 activity and target
specificity; (2) To evaluate anti-tumor efficacy of Ab-IL21 in humanized mouse PDX models."

Post-traumatic stress and alcohol use disorder (PTSD/AUD) are frequently comorbid and are a major US health
burden. Individuals with comorbid PTSD/AUD manifest complex symptoms including greater risk for alcohol
drinking and relapse, sleep disturbances, hyperarousal, drinking-related aggression, and increased suicidal
ideations. Identification of the molecular mechanisms underlying PTSD/AUD disorder will aid the development
of novel therapeutic strategies. In this proposal, my focus will be on two key components of the extended
amygdala (EA), the central amygdala (CeA) and the bed nucleus stria terminalis (BNST). The CeA and BNST
are regions essential for the regulation of alcohol consumption, stress, and anxiety. In the EA, overactive brain
stress systems are hallmark feature of comorbid PTSD/AUD, primarily driven by the pro-stress neuropeptide,
corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF), resulting in long-lasting negative emotional states. New research has
highlighted that the neuropeptide somatostatin (SST) displays anxiolytic (anti-stress) and alcohol-reducing
properties and may act to oppose the effects of CRF in the brain. Both CeA and BNST are abundant in SST/CRF,
and blockade of CRF or activation of SST system reduces consumption of alcohol and anxiety-like behavior in
various rodent models and species. In this proposal, I will apply a multidisciplinary approach (e.g., in situ
hybridization, ex vivo electrophysiology, chemogenetics, viral gene transfer of SST, and site-specific behavioral
pharmacology) to understand the role of SST system in the EA in PTSD/AUD comorbidity. My overarching
hypothesis is that SST signaling may exert reductions of PTSD/AUD phenotypes counteracting an “overactive”
CRF in the EA. During my K99 mentoring phase, I will receive critical training in in situ hybridization, and ex vivo
electrophysiology to understand neuronal expression and synaptic function of SST/CRF systems in PTSD/AUD.
During my independent R00 phase, I will continue to perform electrophysiology, and apply site-specific
behavioral pharmacology combined with chemogenetics and viral expression of SST to examine the behavioral
modulation of PTSD/AUD by SST/CRF systems. The goal of this MOSAIC K99/R00 is to enhance my training
in in situ hybridization and electrophysiological methods to complement my prior training in addiction
neuroscience. This award will also provide critical professional career development to guide me in building an
independent research program centered around stress disorders and AUD. Collectively, the proposed work will
provide novel insight into the mechanistic role of SST and its potential therapeutic use for PTSD/AUD."

Targeting the hallmark biomarker prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has been a successful small
molecule drug-delivery strategy for various payloads to prostate tumor cells, which is evident in the FDA's
recent approval of 177Lu-PSMA-617 and the clinical advancement of our 18F-CTT1057 (an irreversible-binding
phosphoramidate-based) PSMA-targeted PET-imaging agent (NCT04838626, NCT04838613). However,
efforts to develop PSMA-targeted chemotherapeutic nanomedicine have had limited clinical therapeutic
efficacy. Our long-term goal is to develop a versatile and intelligently designed platform for the selective
delivery of synergistic therapeutic payloads to offer novel treatment options for lengthening and improving the
quality of life for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients. The overall objective of this
project is to develop a PSMA-targeted small-molecule dual drug conjugate (SMDDC) to serve as a companion
therapeutic to our PSMA-targeted PET-imaging agent (NCT02916537, NCT03427476). Our central hypothesis
is that tumor-site activation and release of two distinct chemotherapeutic payloads for prostate cancer can be
achieved and will be more effective than small molecule drug conjugates (SMDCs) releasing only a single
chemotherapeutic payload. The rationale for developing SMDDCs is to set the groundwork for a new, dual-
drug therapeutic strategy for patients with mCRPC and advanced malignancies with PSMA(+) neovasculature.
Two specific aims will be pursued to test the central hypothesis: 1) Assess the spatio-temporal cargo-release in
prostate tumor cells with a PSMA-targeted small-molecule dual probe conjugate (SMDPC); and 2) Determine
the potency enhancement of a SMDDC bearing dual payloads in prostate cancer cell lines. For Aim 1,
PSMA(+) and PSMA(-) prostate cancer cell lines will be used to assess the spatio-temporal cargo-release of a
PSMA-targeted SMDPC bearing two distinct turn-on probes, 7-Amino-4-methylcoumarin and hydroxymethyl
rhodamine green. Established PSMA activity assays will be used to determine the IC50 and mode of binding for
the PSMA-targeted SMDPC. In Aim 2, in vitro effectiveness of an SMDDC bearing both MMAE and Exatecan
vs. an SMDC bearing either MMAE or Exatecan alone will be evaluated in PSMA(+) and PSMA(-) prostate
cancer cell lines. The proposed work is innovative because it aims to utilize a unique combination of drug-
delivery strategies; PSMA-ligand promoted internalization, a novel acid-labile linker for pH-triggered drug
release, and two distinct chemotherapeutic drugs with differing mechanisms of action. This will be a significant
achievement because it will provide proof-of-concept for developing clinically relevant chemotherapy for
mCRPC and other malignancies with PSMA(+) neovasculature. Future plans include expanding the selection
of drug payloads for PSMA-targeted SMDDCs and initiate preclinical IND-enabling studies. The expected
positive impact of these studies is that they will, in all likelihood, set the foundation for a general, dual-drug
strategy for targeted chemotherapy for other biomarker-characterized diseases."

 This K01 career development award will position the candidate to become an independent translational re-
searcher studying mind-body movement therapies (MBMT) for chronic pain conditions linked to chronic inflam-
mation, beginning with persistent post-surgical pain (PPSP) as a model. BACKGROUND. Incidence of PPSP
varies according to surgical type, with clinically meaningful pain developing in roughly 30% of patients. PPSP
has physiological, cognitive, and emotional effects and is associated with reduced quality of life. Within the do-
main of chronic pain, PPSP is a unique pathological entity that combines nerve injury and inflammatory pro-
cesses. PPSP involves peripheral surgical injury of skin, connective tissue, and myofascial-associated tissues,
as well as peripheral and central pain sensitization. A growing body of research supports the benefit of MBMT,
such as yoga, in treating chronic pain conditions; however, little attention has been devoted specifically to spe-
cific needs of individuals with PPSP. This K01 proposes a pilot translational RCT of yoga for PPSP with two
research Aims. AIM 1: To design and conduct a pilot feasibility RCT of yoga in individuals with PPSP. This aim
contains three specific sections: Aim 1a will adapt a validated yoga program to individuals with PPSP. Aim 1b
will assess recruitment, retention, adherence, and acceptability. Aim 1c will assess feasibility of collecting bio-
logical and clinical outcomes of PPSP. Exploratory AIM 2: To explore the longitudinal relationship between
yoga or an education control group on changes in PPSP-related inflammatory markers and other known psy-
chophysical and psychosocial modulators of PPSP. TRAINING. The candidate will achieve a well-defined set
of training goals leveraging a resource-rich institutional environment and a cohesive training plan to develop
and acquire expertise in: (1) the biological basis of PPSP, (2) the design and conduct of translational clinical
trials, and (3) longitudinal analytic experience for translational research. In addition to ongoing mentorship
meetings and experiential training through the research plan, the candidate will complete targeted coursework,

Latinx people are the largest and fastest growing minority population in the U.S., yet most lack access to
culturally responsive preventative interventions to reduce substance use among youth. Effective
implementation of evidence-based interventions that can be delivered online is critical to reduce substance use
and problem behaviors among ethnic minority populations and to scale up for broad dissemination. Cultural
adaptation has improved parenting practices and youth outcomes beyond the original evidence-based
parenting interventions, and culturally adapted parenting programs have the potential to improve cultural
socialization, which is associated with improved behavioral outcomes among Latinx youth. However, ongoing
tensions in the field highlight the question of whether deep cultural adaptations compared to surface-level
adaptations (e.g., translation only) are needed. The FCU is an evidence-based parenting program that has a
strong history of reducing substance abuse and externalizing symptoms (e.g., problem behaviors). A
community-based participatory approach will be employed to culturally adapt the FCU Online and identify
implementation strategies to improve access to and adoption of the intervention, leveraging community and
cultural resiliency-promoting assets. Promotores de salud, Spanish-speaking community health workers in an
existing community-based research network will deliver the program. To reach the goals of the study, the
following aims will guide this research. In Aim 1, a community advisory board of 6 parents and 6 promotores de
salud will meet monthly to guide the ecological, cultural adaptation of the FCU Online modules and
implementation strategies with promotores. In Aim 2, the online version of the intervention will be adapted
using iterative Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles to get usability feedback from members of the community advisory
board, consistent with best practices designed to adapt interventions in community settings. In Aim 3, using a
Hybrid 1, mixed methods design, researchers will assess feasibility, accessibility, adoption, and potential
effectiveness of the adapted intervention, FCU-L Online. The team will recruit 96 Latinx families into a 3-arm
wait-list randomized control trial: n=32 in the culturally adapted FCU-L Online (e.g., deep adaptation), n=32 in
the FCU Online in Spanish without adaptation (e.g., surface level adaptation), and n= 32 in a waitlist control
group. Feasibility, accessibility, and adoption will be assessed according to quantitative benchmarks, and
qualitative feedback will assess the barriers and facilitators of implementation. Potential effectiveness will be
assessed, including improvement of key intervention mechanisms (parenting practices, parenting efficacy, and
cultural socialization) as well as child outcomes (substance use, intentions to use, and externalizing behavior).
Findings from this study will inform a Hybrid II randomized controlled implementation trial to test effectiveness
while scaling up dissemination of the FCU-L Online. This research could ultimately reduce lifetime risk for
substance use among Latinx youth by improving parenting practices and supporting cultural socialization."
10952637,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Persistent organic pollutants such as organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) can accumulate in the body
and interact with nuclear receptors important in endocrine regulation. Given that OPFR exposure is pervasive
in the human population, there is a critical need to determine the impact of long-term exposure to OPFRs on
human health. Specifically, the impact of OPFR exposure on metabolic and brain aging remains undetermined.
Recent studies showed that perinatal exposure to an OPFR, triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), led to exacerbated
high fat diet-induced metabolic syndrome and gut dysbiosis. Notably, gut dysbiosis and the decrease in gut
barrier function have been associated with augmentation of systemic inflammation, metabolic dysfunction,
neuroinflammation and aging. Preliminary data from the lab showed an age-associated increase in facultative,
pro-inflammatory Proteobacteria, an indicator of epithelial cell dysfunction. Consistently, preliminary data
showed age-associated increases in gut permeability and systemic inflammation. Furthermore, using
untargeted serum metabolomics, tryptophan metabolism was identified as a signature pathway associated with
aging; remarkably, indole and indole-3-lactic acid, beneficial metabolites derived from the bacterial tryptophan
catabolism pathway, were significantly decreased with age. In addition, there were age-associated decreases
in fecal levels of butyric and propionic acids; these microbially produced short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) have
been shown to improve glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Importantly, new preliminary data
suggested that acute TPHP exposure in young adult mice exerted deleterious effects on colon epithelial cells,
with impaired barrier function and shifts in metabolism that favors colonization of facultative, pathogenic
bacteria. Together, these data provide a strong scientific premise for studying long-term effects of TPHP on the
microbiome-gut-brain axis in aging. The central hypothesis is that exposure to TPHP induces gut dysbiosis,
leading to gut barrier dysfunction, systemic inflammation, and neuroinflammation; these inflammatory
pathologies exacerbate aging-associated metabolic and cognitive decline. This exploratory hypothesis will be
tested by pursuing the following aim: Define the extent to which TPHP exposure contributes to metabolic and
cognitive decline. An aging cohort will be used, starting TPHP exposure from 10 months (M) of age as a mid-life
exposure model. Fecal microbiome, metabolome at 10, 15 and 18 M, in vivo metabolic and cognitive function at 13-15
M will be assessed in sub-Aim A, and, using these mice as donor mice, the causality of dysbiotic microbiota
induced by TPHP exposure in exacerbating metabolic and brain aging will be mechanistically tested via fecal
microbiota transplantation experiments in sub-Aim B. Senescence phenotypes in colon, liver, and brain will be
characterized in sub-Aim C. Overall, results will demonstrate the contributions of TPHP-induced gut dysbiosis in
driving the host intestinal epithelial cells dysfunction, in the pathogenesis towards pro-inflammatory state and
senescence in the host, and provide evidence for TPHP as a new determinant in the exposome in aging."

The United States is currently in an opioid crisis, and NIDA is committed to research on the mechanisms and
treatment of opioid use disorder. Current Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacotherapies for
opioid use disorder include the MOR agonist methadone, the MOR partial agonist buprenorphine, and the
MOR antagonist naltrexone. However, the clinical utility of all three compounds is limited for various reasons.
Therefore, it is imperative to develop novel and effective drug candidates with enhanced therapeutic effects
and reduced undesirable effects. Recently, we have identified several highly selective and potent MOR
modulators as novel leads for opioid use disorder treatment. They all showed more promising pharmacological
profiles compared to other known drugs in this category. The current proposal will focus on further
development of these leads for preclinical IND-enabling studies, and dynamic drug discovery and development
pipeline construct. Four integrated specific aims will be pursued in this project in two phases. In the UG3
phase, we will 1) further Validate therapeutic profiles of the current leads with self-administration and PK
studies, and 2) expand the small molecule library to build a dynamic drug discovery and development pipeline.
In the UH3 phase, we will 1) conduct preclinical IND-enabling studies on the lead(s) identified from UG3 phase,
and 2) compare in vivo pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profiles of the new hits from UG3 phase with
current leads to define our next generation of lead compound(s)."
10948728,"Project Summary/Abstract
Salt-Inducible Kinases (SIKs) were previously identified as the downstream mediators of PTH receptor signaling
in osteocytes in Dr. Yoon’s mentor’s (Dr. Marc Wein) work. Similarly, Dr. Yoon recently reported that PTH receptor
signaling suppresses SIKs to induce Cyp27b1 (vitamin D activating enzyme) expression in kidney to promote
1,25-vitamin D (active form of vitamin D) synthesis. To build on these findings, this project will investigate the
role of SIKs in PTH-induced Cyp24a1 reduction in kidney. Together with previous findings, this work will
demonstrate a novel pathway of how parathyroid hormone (PTH) regulates 1,25-vitamin D. This aim will involve
in-depth bioinformatics training with Dr. Mark Meyer on ChIP-sequencing analysis to identify genomic location(s)
where transcription factors bind to regulate Cyp24a1 in response to PTH or SIK inhibition. Based on these studies,
Dr. Yoon will evaluate the therapeutic potential of SIK inhibition in MBDs with insufficient 1,25-vitamin D levels
and compromised bone health: chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) and
hypoparathyroidism (hypoPT). CKD-MBD has complex pathophysiology with high phosphate and FGF23 levels,
secondary hyper-PT yet blunted PTH actions (resulting in low 1,25-vitamin D) due to PTH-resistance. Here, it is
hypothesized that targeting SIKs, PTH downstream mediators, will bypass PTH-resistance, which could occur
due to abnormalities at the receptor level, and bring PTH-like effects in CKD-MBD by increasing 1,25-vitamin D
synthesis and bone formation. These dual benefits of SIK inhibition will shift the paradigm of how we approach
CKD-MBD. Likewise, we also hypothesize that SIK inhibitor will increase serum calcium and improve bone health
and biomechanical properties in parathyroidectomized mice via stimulating 1,25-vitamin D and bone turnover.
Because there are no effective treatments which can improve both mineral metabolism and bone health in these
MBDs, this study will suggest a novel target in such diseases. Dr. Yoon will acquire mouse surgery skills to create
hypo-PT mouse model with co-mentor Dr. Michael Mannstadt. Moreover, Dr. Yoon will work with Dr. Harald
Jueppner on integrative analysis of mineral metabolism parameters in both translational studies. These studies
will advance knowledge and provide robust training opportunities in the fields on gene regulation, CKD-MBD,
and hypoparathyroidism from a skilled team of experienced mentors. Overall, this career development award
will help Dr. Yoon to achieve her ultimate career goal, to explore molecular mechanisms between mineral and
bone metabolism regulating factors and hormones in physiological and pathological states."

Human retroviral infections (i.e., human immunodeficiency virus type 1, HIV-1; and HIV type 2, HIV-2) impact a
combined 38 million people worldwide and result in at least 680,000 deaths per year. Despite advancements in
antiretroviral therapies (ART), there presently is no cure for these infections. Given the continued development
of antiviral drug resistance, there remains a need for basic science investigations in addressing crucial
knowledge gaps in the field, such studies can inform antiretroviral target identification, and have broad
applications towards therapy and cure. One of the key aspects of HIV-1 replication that has remained
underexplored has been virus particle assembly. Here in this proposal, the overarching hypothesis being tested
is that differences in human retroviral capsid (CA) protein structure and CA-CA interactions can provide new
insights into particle assembly and help identify conserved features that may be promising antiretroviral targets.
There are three lines of investigation being pursued. First, the differential CA interfaces among HIV-2 will be
investigated to examine whether differences in Gag lattice morphologies can be attributed to differences in CA
interfaces. Second, comparative analysis between the HIV-1 and HIV-2 capsid core structure will be determined
to assess whether a novel helix in the HIV-2 mature CA is present and responsible for morphogenesis of the
mature CA lattice. Finally, the molecular and structural basis for differences in HIV particle assembly and viral
infectivity will be investigated using site-directed mutagenesis studies. The proposed studies will provide new
insights into the structure-function relationships among CA proteins and enable new insights in human retroviral
replication."
10953395,"SUMMARY
Despite significant research and investment, no FDA approved broad spectrum countermeasures are available
to rapidly mitigate vesicant-induced injury following intentional or accidental chemical exposure. Inflammatory
pathways are a promising shared target for therapeutic intervention as: (1) inflammatory mechanisms may be
conserved across multiple vesicants as inflammatory damage is present in all types of burns; (2) burn injury is
not static, inflammatory damage continues to occur up to 72 hours after exposure and there is potential to
arrest inflammatory damage and necrosis with early anti-inflammatory intervention; and (3) there is an existing
portfolio of anti-inflammatory therapies and an active drug development pipeline that can be applied and
optimized.
Current approaches to investigate inflammatory mechanisms in skin lack integration of mechanistic and spatial
information. Systemic fluid readouts may not accurately reflect local burn response and all spatial information
is lost when skin biopsies are homogenized for traditional omics analyses. Histological analysis of biopsies can
provide spatial information regarding tissue damage but lacks mechanistic insight. Therefore, novel spatial
omics approaches that provide in situ understanding of the pathological response will be important tools in the
discovery and development of medical countermeasures to vesicant-induced damage.
The long-term objective of this research is to implement and establish a state-of-the-art spatial multi-omics
platform to investigate conserved mechanisms of inflammatory damage induced by cutaneous exposure of
sulfur mustard and lewisite vesicants in a clinically relevant porcine skin model. Utilizing innovative methods in
spatial mass spectrometry, MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), immunohistochemistry, and
spatial transcriptomics we will map the distribution of transcriptional pathways and biomediators associated
with localized vesicant-induced skin damage.
The specific aims of this study are to 1) Identify the inflammatory phenotypes induced in response to dermal
exposure to sulfur mustard and lewisite; and 2) Use high resolution spatial transcriptomics integrated with
MALDI-MSI and immunohistochemistry to identify pathologic programs conserved across sulfur mustard and
lewisite burn lesions.
Our proposed spatial mapping approach will allow us to decipher the local inflammatory pathological effects of
vesicants not evident in systemic studies and thus elucidate conserved pathologic inflammatory pathways that
drive tissue damage and can be targeted for the development of medical countermeasures."
10952272,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is considered a world-wide public health
problem caused by metabolic syndrome. It is estimated that 30% of the world population have MASLD. Such
proportion is subject to increase up to 56% within the next 10 years. The burden of MASLD extended to its
significant association with the risk of HCC development. Moreover, it is predicted that the incidence of
MASLD-related HCC will rise in US concurrently with increasing the prevalence of obesity. Unfortunately,
majority of HCC patients are diagnosed with advanced stage with limited treatment modalities and with less
than 20% five-year survival rate. Recently the use of immune checkpoints inhibitors and immunotherapy
emerged as a promising therapeutic option for HCC patients with advanced stage and making it a first-line
treatment for these patients. However, it has been demonstrated that immunotherapy is less effective in
patients with MASLD-related HCC. We hypothesize that alterations in gut microbiota composition (dysbiosis) in
MASLD patients can lead to increase gut permeability leading to microbial translocation and increase hepatic
exposure to microbiota with the consequence of diverse inflammatory factors that can lead to cellular
proliferation and progression of MASLD to HCC and the same may provide early prediction and prognosis for
HCC. Therefore, we propose a pilot study to test our hypothesis and to generate preliminary results for future
large-scale studies. We proposed 3 aims: 1) To characterize the baseline gut microbiome diversity associated
with MASLD with and without HCC in 5 different groups (N=20 of each group): a) MASLD without cirrhosis, b)
MASLD with cirrhosis, c) MASLD-related cirrhotic HCC, d) MASLD-non-cirrhotic HCC, and e) HCC without
MASLD; 2) To correlate the baseline and sequential changes in gut microbiota with immunotherapy response
and with immunotherapy adverse events in HCC patients (N=60) with and without MASLD; and 3) To evaluate
whether genes and proteins relevant to susceptibility and prognosis of MASLD-related HCC may alter the
composition of the gut microbiota and may explain the post-immunotherapy outcome of MASLD-related HCC.
To achieve this pilot study within 2 years, we will take advantage of the existing research infrastructure at
Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and MD Anderson (MDACC) including 1) IRB approved protocols for patient
recruitment with blood and stool collection and 2) Supporting preliminary results of the significant association
between MASLD-HCC risk and prognosis with biologically related genetic and circulating markers. Whole
Genome Shotgun sequencing will be performed on stool samples at the core facility of BCM. Blood samples
will be processed to test for the significant genetic and protein markers at MDACC
and at Rules-Based
Medicine (RBM) Texas-based company
. Findings from this study may shed the light on the role of
microbiota in MASLD-related HCC that would influence the prognostication strategies and immunotherapy with
a personalized approach in MASLD-related HCC."

Zika virus, a small positive-stranded RNA virus, causes a remarkable spectrum of infection outcomes, ranging
from asymptomatic infection in up to 80% of individuals to microcephaly in congenital Zika syndrome. This
variation in human susceptibility was highlighted during the 2015-2016 epidemic of the Americas that resulted in
over a million infections and 3,500 cases of microcephaly in Brazil alone. These differences in outcome arise
from the complex interplay of exposure, environment, age, Zika virus genetics, and human genetics.
The overall goal of my lab is to understand how human genetic diversity regulates susceptibility and severity of
infections. Famous examples of genetic differences that profoundly impact susceptibility include sickle cell allele
protection against malaria and CCR5 deletion protection against HIV. Such genetic differences can lead to
insights on pathogenesis, drug targets (e.g. CCR5 inhibitors), and more personalized care. While genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) are a powerful approach to discover common genetic differences that confer
disease resistance, there are no published GWAS of human Zika virus infection. However, studies of dizygotic
twins with discordant outcomes have demonstrated that cells from the twin exhibiting congenital Zika syndrome
are more susceptible to infection in vitro. Therefore, we hypothesize that human genetic differences that regulate
Zika infection can be identified through measuring inter-individual variation in cellular infection phenotypes. To
facilitate identification of genetic variants that affect cellular infection phenotypes, we developed a rapid single-
cell GWAS approach called scHi-HOST (single-cell High-throughput Human in vitrO Susceptibility Testing). scHi-
HOST facilitates assignment of each cell to a genotyped individual, phenotyping of each cell for viral entry and
burden, and measurement of host transcriptomic response, all from a single scRNA-seq experiment. We propose
that coupling cell-based human genetics and functional validation will facilitate discovery of novel pathways and
genetic determinants of susceptibility. Specifically, we will 1) identify human genetic variants that confer
susceptibility/resistance to cellular Zika virus infection for strains representing the major Zika virus lineages, and
2) experimentally validate genetic variants and causal genes associated with cellular susceptibility to Zika virus
using CRISPR-based approaches in diverse cell types.
Thus, this project will generate an experimentally validated, high-resolution analysis of how human
genetic variants impact cellular infection phenotypes during Zika virus infection. This will serve as a
springboard for characterizing identified variants more deeply through future mechanistic studies and
examining clinical relevance in human studies. Understanding these differences could lead to new diagnostic
approaches in identifying at-risk individuals and novel therapeutic strategies for treatment."

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a prevalent global health problem with substantial social, economic, and public
health costs. Progression from initial alcohol exposure to AUD often begins in adolescence and emerging
adulthood with impulsive personality traits (IPTs) being critical developmental risk factors. However, there is
limited understanding of the dynamic longitudinal interplay between IPTs and alcohol involvement from childhood
to adulthood and the role neurobiological and genetic vulnerability play in this etiology in part because: 1)
longitudinal studies of IPT-AUD associations to date typically characterize specific developmental epochs (e.g.,
late adolescence), rarely comprehensively examining these associations across the full developmental span; 2)
studies of neuroanatomical variation associated with IPT-AUD pathways are primarily based on small, cross-
sectional datasets and restricted subsets of brain regions, despite accumulating evidence that large samples
sizes are necessary to reliably characterize brain-phenotype associations and the importance of
neurodevelopmental trajectories on complex behavior; and 3) large-scale genome-wide association studies of
IPTs have been primarily conducted in older adults of European ancestry, despite the clear developmental
context underlying IPT-AUD pathways and need for further incorporation of diverse ancestral populations into
genomics research. This K01 proposal addresses these gaps by: 1) Aim 1: characterizing developmental
associations (childhood to middle adulthood) between distinct IPTs, heavy alcohol use, and AUD progression
through data harmonization and longitudinal integrative data analysis of 16 extant primarily longitudinal study
samples (N=85,862); 2) Aim 2: examining whether IPTs represent plausible mechanisms through which brain
structure is linked to alcohol involvement using a subset of 9 neuroimaging studies (N=17,297) spanning
childhood to young adulthood; and 3) Aim 3: identifying developmentally specific genetic influences on IPTs,
alcohol involvement, and the links between them to assess genetic stability and/or uniqueness across
development using trans-ancestral genetic data. This K01 would provide the applicant with training to facilitate
transition to career independence by enabling him to: 1) acquire expertise in longitudinal data harmonization and
integrative data analytic approaches; 2) build a foundational neuroimaging data analysis skill set and
developmental addiction neuroscience knowledge base; 3) expand genomic analytic expertise to encompass
trans-ancestral and longitudinal genome-wide association study approaches; and 4) cultivate professional and
career development toward an independent research career. Collectively, this proposal would prepare the
applicant to lead an innovative research program into the genetic and biological etiology of AUD development
as an independent investigator and would provide novel insights into the developmental etiology and
neurogenetic sources of variation underlying IPT-AUD pathways."

Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has gained popularity in recent years by offering increased manipulation dexter-
ity in hard-to-reach areas through small incisions, thereby reducing patient pain, complication rate, and recovery
time. However, MIS often involves a limited ﬁeld of view, complex hand-eye coordination, and limited depth and
tactile information. Without sufﬁcient timely and context-aware feedback, these procedures are difﬁcult to learn
and, even then, still challenging and risky. Aiming to understand the activities and progress of the surgery to
provide valuable feedback, artiﬁcial intelligence, and machine learning technologies have been proposed. How-
ever, large-scale and high-quality data has been a consistent bottleneck to new developments and the inclusion
of new surgical disciplines and procedures. In modern surgery, a dramatic amount of video data is captured
at a high resolution and frame rate, so it is impractical to label the data densely, and until now, existing pub-
licly available surgical datasets are still dismally small in size and representativeness compared to non-surgical
datasets, attributing to the necessity of costly hand-labeling by clinical experts. This projoect proposes to develop
autonomous algorithms for rapid, cost-effective surgical video frame annotation. Speciﬁcally, the approach ad-
dresses methods to automatically compress lengthy surgical video data to only key informative time segments
based on surgical context (Aim 1) and ﬁnd within these segments the most informative video keyframes of speciﬁc
anatomy/tissues to be used eventually for downstream tasks such as annotation and/or image-guidance (Aim 2).
The expected outcome will be algorithms automatically identifying informative video segments and selecting the
most information-rich keyframes to extract for hand-labeled annotations. These keyframes may then be used to
learn neural network-based semantic segmentation models that can be trained to perform pixel-level recognition
of anatomy in the scene. A colorectal robotic surgery dataset of low anterior resection will be built as part of
the effort, where there is signiﬁcant clinical importance in recognizing anatomy to avoid hitting nerves that could
lead to erectile dysfunction. We will compare the performance of the segmentation algorithms trained with our
proposed sparse annotations against algorithms trained with denser (but more costly) annotations. If success-
ful, the project will generate a solution to address the lack of high-quality data. The obtained preliminary data
with algorithms trained on it will provide rich semantic information to potentially enhance surgery safety, improve
treatment outcomes, and reduce healthcare expenses in the future."

The human calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) detects fluctuations in the circulating Ca2+ concentration and
maintains extracellular Ca2+ homeostasis by regulating parathyroid hormone secretion. In addition, the receptor
mediates a wide range of cellular processes unrelated to Ca2+ balance such as fetal development. Malfunction
of CaSR is associated with a vareity of Ca2+ homeostatic disorders including potentially life threatening neonatal
hypercalcaemic conditions. Abnormalities in the CaSR gene has also been implicated in other diseases including
cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. The functional diversity of the CaSR results from its ability to signal through all
four subtypes of G proteins, including Gq/11, Gi/o, Gs, and G12/13. We have used Cryo-electron microscopy (EM) to
solve the structures of active CaSR complexed with different G proteins. In this application, we will build upon
this structural data to explore how the CaSR achieves G protein selectivity and promiscuity using structure-based
functional studies. We will also assess the signaling effects of naturally occurring mutations in the receptor that
are linked to Ca2+ metabolic and other disorders. We will determine the impact of these mutations on cell surface
expression as well as activation of each of the four G protein families. In addition, we will explore the ability of
positive and negative allosteric modulators to normalize receptor signaling. Finally, we will initiate structural
studies to understand the mechanistic basis for naturally occurring mutations that differentially impact the various
G protein subtypes. Our work will elucidate the intracellular signaling mechanisms of the CaSR and map out the
functional roles of disease mutations. The information gathered from our studies will assist the design of
therapeutics targeting specific CaSR mutations and guide precision medicine efforts in the future."
10933100,"PROJECT SUMMARY - ResBiotic Inc. is developing its lead drug product, RB1000, a spray-dried powder com-
prised of an inhaled biotherapeutic API for treatment of neutrophilic inflammation and disease progression in
COPD patients. COPD is a chronic degenerative disease that is the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S.,
where it predominantly results from tobacco smoke exposure. Acute exacerbations are a sudden worsening of
symptoms that can occur frequently, ≥ 2 per year in severe cases, and can result in reduced lung function,
reduced health status, and increased risk for mortality. Treatment approaches including short- and long-acting
bronchodilators, corticosteroids, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, cytokine blockers, and respiratory stimulants
have been used but with limited clinical efficacy. Inhaled corticosteroids are used specifically to treat inflamma-
tion but have potential for serious side effects, e.g., severe pneumonia and death. Combination therapies have
demonstrated modest reductions in exacerbation frequency, but there is still significant room for improvement,
as these therapeutics do not halt disease progression and often can have serious side effects. Recent research
has demonstrated a strong association between neutrophilic inflammation that results from dysbiosis, i.e., an
altered microbiome, of the lung in COPD. ResBiotic has demonstrated that heightened levels of proteobacteria
can increase expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and neutrophil elastase (NE), which are associ-
ated with neutrophilic inflammation and can cause extracellular matrix degradation and airway remodeling. Res-
Biotic has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that anti-inflammatory Lactobacillus strains can reduce inflammation
resulting from dysbiosis, including the expression of MMP-9 and NE, which may enable highly effective biother-
apeutic drugs for COPD. Commercialization of a Lactobacillus-based biotherapeutic drug would provide an al-
ternative anti-inflammatory approach with a different mechanism of action than currently available therapeutics.
The goal of this proposal will be to develop a biotherapeutic drug that includes non-living components of a Lac-
tobacillus bacterial extract that are responsible for the therapeutic response. Phase I will include screening dif-
ferent cellular components at various dosages to identify several candidates that reduce MMP-9 expression in
primary human bronchial epithelial cells taken from COPD patients. Phase II will include the development of a
dry powder formulation of optimal candidates and safety and efficacy testing in preclinical mouse models of
COPD. The deliverable for Phase II will be a lead candidate that has demonstrated efficacy in reduction of
neutrophilic inflammation and improvements in lung function that is ready to advance to IND-enabling large
mammal studies. Successful commercialization of the inhaled drug product RB1000 is expected to provide an
alternative or complementary treatment modality to the standard of care to address neutrophilic inflammation
resulting from dysbiosis in COPD, which is expected to reduce COPD exacerbations, potentially reduce disease
progression, and improve patient quality of life."

Project Summary/Abstract- 30 lines
The World Health Organization affirms that sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services are integral to the
wellbeing and flourishing of individuals and communities. However, societal dynamics of power and oppression
pattern access to these services, presenting disproportionate barriers to younger people, individuals who identify
as Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC individuals), those with disabilities and chronic disease,
individuals who are transgender or gender-nonconforming (TGNC individuals), and people of lower
socioeconomic status. One exacerbating factor for these health inequities is the social stigmatization of sexuality,
which compels individuals to keep their utilization of SRH services private for fear of negative repercussions,
particularly for people who hold minoritized identities. In the United States, one major threat to patient privacy is
the paper trail associated with utilization of health insurance. Health insurance billing and claims processing for
commercial insurance plans frequently involve sending an “explanation of benefits” (EOB) to the primary
subscriber of the health insurance plan whenever services are provided to any covered family member. When a
person is covered by a parent’s or spouse’s insurance, EOBs are often sent to the primary subscriber, thereby
breaching the person’s confidential health information. Concerns about confidentiality related to insurance billing
can also compound existing barriers to care faced by multiply marginalized persons. Thus, leading health care
organizations have called for policy change to correct this gap in patient confidentiality, and state governments
are increasingly interested in policy solutions to protect individuals’ privacy when using insurance for sensitive
services. Massachusetts is one of only seven states that has enacted legislation (the PATCH law) to protect
confidential use of health insurance coverage, and one of only five that extends such protections to commercially
insured people of all ages, providing a rare opportunity to understand individuals’ utilization of, knowledge of,
and attitudes toward such policy protections. How this novel policy intervention has affected individuals’ attitudes
towards and ability to utilize insurance for sensitive health services has not been studied. We propose to fill this
critical gap in the literature through a mixed-methods study that will directly query SRH service users on their
knowledge of, attitudes towards, and intention to use the protections of the PATCH law. This novel inquiry will
be grounded in an intersectional framework, will engage a diverse statewide patient population, and will use a
mixed methods approach including survey data and qualitative interviews to understand barriers to insurance
utilization, with the goal of improving future health policy interventions."
10844411,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) and its consequences are a major public health concern and have
recently been declared a national public health emergency. Despite the availability of medications
to treat OUD, there is a need for improved treatment modalities that involve other mechanisms of
action. Current pharmacologic treatment options all target the mu-opioid receptor, either as a full
agonist (methadone), partial agonist (buprenorphine), or antagonist (naltrexone). While these
medications have demonstrated efficacy and safety, they also have limitations. Full and partial
agonists have abuse liability, and significant levels of misuse, abuse, and diversion have been
observed in the US and internationally (Lofwall 2014; Yokell 2012). This has resulted in
restrictions on access due to a lack of waivered prescribers and patient limits on prescribing for
buprenorphine and dispensing through federally regulated opioid treatment programs requiring
daily observed buprenorphine. In addition, there are concerns about methadone overdose.
Naltrexone requires abstinence from opioids prior to initiation of treatment, which is a barrier to
treatment for many patients. Of the 2.1 million people suffering from OUD in the US, only 20%
seem to receive any form of treatment and many of those who are treated with these medications
do not achieve abstinence from opioid use and fail to achieve recovery (Saloner 2015). Thus,
there is a need for additional pharmacologic treatment options, particularly for medications without
abuse liability and that do not require completion of withdrawal from opioids prior to treatment.
Nonclinical studies support a role for the orexin system in drug seeking, as compounds that
selectively block signaling at the orexin-1 receptor (OX1R) reduce seeking of multiple drugs of
abuse (James 2017). C4X3256, a Non-Opioid, Highly-Selective OX1R Antagonist has been
shown to have a long residence time at the OX1R, and also reduce intravenous self-
administration and cue-induced reinstatement in animal models of nicotine addiction, suggesting
it could be a treatment for a range of addiction related behaviors. Studies proposed in the
application will move C4X3256 from preclinical development through Phase I testing, including
up to 7 days dosing in healthy volunteers and up to 28 days dosing in subjects with OUD. The
current toxicology studies will support the administration of C4X3256 to human volunteers for 4
weeks. Additional toxicology studies are proposed to allow for extended dosing duration in phase
II and for women of childbearing potential to participate in Phase II outpatient trials. Thus, the

Clinical studies indicate that the aversive somatic states experienced during opioid withdrawal predict drug
craving and increase the risk of relapse. However, little is known about the neural circuitry mediating these
aversive states, or how that circuitry interacts with known components of the neural circuitry mediating relapse
to opioid seeking. Recently, the paraventricular thalamic (PVT) projection to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) was
implicated in opioid withdrawal symptoms in mice exposed to repeated non-contingent morphine. However, it is
unknown whether withdrawal from heroin self-administration engages the PVT➝NAc pathway to drive relapse
by precipitating an aversive and/or painful state. To fill this gap in knowledge, during the K99 mentored phase of
this proposal, I will receive training in optogenetics and brain slice electrophysiology to manipulate neural circuits
implicated in heroin withdrawal and relapse. I will use optogenetics and chemogenetics to determine whether
this pathway is necessary and sufficient to drive aversion or hyperalgesia during heroin withdrawal, as well as
relapse to heroin seeking. I will validate the functionality of the optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches in
vitro using brain slice electrophysiology. My preliminary data indicate that activating the PVT➝NAc pathway is
sufficient to drive aversion and heroin seeking during acute and extended withdrawal after abstinence from
heroin self-administration, but not after extinction training. The PL➝NAc pathway has been proposed as a “final
common pathway” to drug seeking and it has been shown to drive heroin seeking after extinction training. The
extinction procedure may thus engage the prefrontal cortex to diminish the role of the PVT➝NAc pathway in
heroin seeking. A central hypothesis of this proposal is that the prelimbic cortex (PL) drives heroin seeking during
acute opioid withdrawal and after abstinence through an indirect PL➝PVT➝NAc pathway, but through a direct
PL➝NAc pathway after extinction training. During the R00 independent phase of this proposal I will test this
hypothesis using chemogenetics to inhibit the PL➝PVT pathway to attenuate heroin withdrawal-induced
hyperalgesia and relapse. One means by which this shift in circuits may occur, depending on withdrawal
modality, is by shifting glutamatergic drive to the same population of NAc neurons that drive heroin seeking. To
assess this, I will investigate whether a subset of NAc neurons receives convergent inputs from both the PL and
PVT using slice electrophysiology. Another means by which this circuitry may evolve to drive heroin seeking is
through changes in synaptic strength within PL➝PVT➝NAc pathway. I will thus investigate synaptic strength
(measured as AMPA/NMDA ratio) within this circuit. Next, I will test the ability of a long-term depression protocol
(LTD) in vitro to normalize identified changes in synaptic strength, and then apply the same protocol in vivo to
reduce heroin seeking and hyperalgesia during withdrawal from heroin self-administration. These experiments
will reveal the role of PVT circuits in heroin withdrawal and how these circuits interface with known relapse
circuitry to control heroin seeking."

In the last three decades, extensive research has been conducted on the effects of prenatal
alcohol intake on birth outcomes, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, and children’s developmental
delays. However, there is limited research on highly prevalent comorbidities that exist among
pregnant women who consume alcohol during pregnancy, and how these maternal
comorbidities in conjunction with prenatal alcohol consumption affect birth outcomes. Given the
high national rates of obesity and subsequent diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and
related preeclampsia and toxemia along with persistently high rates of preconceptual and
prenatal alcohol consumption among US women, this gap in our science is significant. The
proposed study will address this gap using an innovative approach that yields risk profiles that
may be easily translated into clinical screening tools and provide the underpinnings of tailored
interventions for the target population. The objectives of this study are to: (1a) estimate the
extent of comorbidities among pregnant women with prenatal alcohol exposure; (1b) build
maternal morbidity risk profiles based on social and behavioral determinants of health among
women with prenatal alcohol intake using machine learning (ML) methods; (2a) examine the
effects of comorbidities on adverse birth outcomes among alcohol-exposed pregnancies; and
2(b) build risk profiles for adverse birth outcomes using ML methods.
We will use data from the Prenatal Alcohol and SIDS and Stillbirth Network (PASS) (2007-2015)
and the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (2000-2021). Logistic regression will
be used to compute odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals in examining the direction and
magnitude of the association between comorbidities and alcohol exposure during pregnancy.
Further, we will examine the effects of comorbidities on adverse birth outcomes among alcohol-
exposed pregnancies using traditional statistical methods. ML methods such as classification
trees will be used to construct risk profiles for maternal morbidity and adverse birth outcomes in
identifying high-risk groups based on exposure to prenatal alcohol intake.
This study will provide vital information on comorbidities among women who consume alcohol
during pregnancy. The proposed study presents a model of study that combines both maternal
and infant health in the context of maternal-fetal exposure to alcohol using innovative methods
of data analysis that will yield previously unidentified risk profiles. Given the need for careful
allocation of scarce healthcare resources for prevention and treatment programs, the
identification of these risk profiles is both innovative and critical."
10947803,"Cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) is a tripartite genotoxin with a single catalytic subunit (CdtB) and two cell-
binding subunits (CdtA + CdtC). This AB-type toxin is produced by numerous Gram-negative pathogens and
has been intensively studied because of its possible link to cancer: it damages the DNA of a target cell and
could thus cause genomic instability leading to oncogenesis. To reach the host DNA, CDT moves by vesicle
carriers from the cell surface through the endosomes and Golgi apparatus en route to the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER). CdtA dissociates from the rest of the toxin before reaching the Golgi, and CdtB separates from
CdtC in the ER. The free CdtB subunit then crosses the ER membrane and enters the nucleus where it acts as
a DNase and, possibly, a PIP3 phosphatase. No other AB toxin has a two-stage mechanism to separate the
catalytic and cell-binding subunits. CdtB is not active until it dissociates from the two cell-binding components
of the toxin, yet the molecular mechanism for disassembly of the CDT holotoxin remains unknown. The goal of
this project is to elucidate the molecular details of this essential process in CDT intoxication. We recently
reported that, after endocytosis of the intact Haemophilus ducreyi CDT holotoxin, the low pH of the endosomes
induces the separation of CdtA from CdtB/CdtC. Preliminary experiments indicate that CdtB dissociates from
CdtC in the presence of ATP, which is present in the ER but not the endosomes or Golgi. ATP only binds to
the CdtB subunit, but it does not alter the structure of CdtB. In addition, ATP does not affect the stability of the
tripartite CDT holotoxin. The endosome-localized dissociation of CdtA from CdtB/CdtC must therefore precede
the ATP-induced separation of CdtB from CdtC. CDT thus appears to use the physiology of the host
endomembrane system as a sensing mechanism to regulate its two-stage disassembly.
We predict ATP induces disassembly of the CdtB/CdtC dimer by acting as a competitive inhibitor of CdtB
binding to CdtC. ATP does not affect the CDT holotoxin because CdtA either prevents ATP from binding to
CdtB or stabilizes the interaction between CdtB and CdtC. In this project, we will establish the mechanism by
which CdtA blocks the ATP-induced separation of CdtB from CdtC. We will identify the ATP biding site in CdtB
by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. This information will provide further insight into how ATP
triggers CdtB/CdtC disassembly and will serve as a foundation for the generation of CdtB variants that cannot
bind ATP. Those variants will then be used in a series of experiments to document how intracellular transport,
disassembly, nuclear translocation, and cellular activity are affected when CDT contains a CdtB subunit that
cannot bind ATP. Our work will elucidate both the ""how"" and ""why"" of the two-stage CDT disassembly process."
10948766,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT.
In the era of precision medicine, molecular diagnostics (MDx) can deliver unprecedented opportunities for
individualized approaches to care and improve clinical outcomes. Yet, the pace of precision medicine discovery
has far exceeded the rate of implementation; consequently, MDx implementation across populations, diseases,
and clinical settings is uneven, and disparities persist. Disparities stem from complex and multilevel barriers, but
research indicates that patient-facing cost barriers are the biggest challenge for emerging MDx, where clinical
guidelines are evolving and payer coverage is uneven. For many conditions, prompt MDx results are essential
for personalized treatment approaches to improve outcomes, but barriers that prevent or delay payment for MDx
testing can result in either mistreatment or delayed treatment. Institution-level interventions that facilitate access
to MDx payment pathways and work towards increasing coverage for MDx will improve patient outcomes and
guide effective, ethical, and equitable precision medicine implementation. However, developing strategies to
increase MDx access requires new approaches to (1) empirically examine payment pathways to MDx access
and (2) identify and characterize the range of institutional resources that best promote access to MDx payment
pathways. The proposed research achieves this objective by using a case study of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)
testing for lung cancer patients; the specific aims are:
Aim 1: Analyze differences in patient-level factors associated with different payment pathways for MDx.
Aim 2: Define institution-level resources associated with promoting access to MDx payment pathways.
Aim 3: Identify and prioritize institution-level interventions that are promising candidates to promote equitable
access to MDx payment pathways.
The project will provide a knowledge base to understand and improve disparities in access to MDx payment and
generate timely evidence to guide more equitable PM implementation. The training plan for the project builds on
my expertise in conducting interdisciplinary research to identify PM disparities. It expands my range of qualitative
(advanced skills in narrative elicitation) and qualitative data (advanced machine learning and natural language
processing [NLP] skills to analyze electronic health record [EHR] data) to conduct rigorous mixed methods
research. Comprehensive training and mentoring in health services research, health policy, clinical genetics,
health disparities, and implementation science will enable me to effectively translate study findings into effective
strategies to promote precision medicine access. The skills and knowledge gained from the training will inform my
R01 and lay the foundation for developing practices and policies that can have a significant impact on reducing
disparities in precision medicine."
10947752,"Inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) is frequently observed in clear cell Renal Cell
Carcinoma (RCC). The mutated pVHL does not bind and degrade the regulatory α-subunits of the hypoxia-
inducible factor (HIF-1/2/3α) under normoxia causing overexpression of HIF-dependent pro-angiogenic factors
such as VEGF, EPO, PDGF, etc. As a result, RCCs are highly vascular in nature. Extensive studies have
established that the inhibition of the HIF pathway is sufficient to suppress tumor growth by the VHL‒/‒ RCC
cells, offering an attractive target to treat this disease. We have shown that pure honokiol inhibits the HIF
pathway and hypoxia-mediated expression of pro-angiogenic genes in a number of cancer cell lines. Honokiol
also inhibits constitutively active HIF pathway and expression of pro-angiogenic genes in VHL‒/‒ RCC4 cells
under normoxia. Further, we have determined the mechanism of action of honokiol using chromatin
immunoprecipitation experiments. These finding have allowed us to synthesize a new class of boron based
HIF inhibitors with improved efficacy and anti-angiogenic properties under in vitro conditions. In this project we
propose two specific aims: (i) determine the structure-activity-relationship (SAR) of honokiol analogs on the
inhibition of the HIF pathway and (ii) determine the efficacy of selected honokiol analogs in a xenograft RCC
mouse model. At the completion of this project, our expectation is that we will have evaluated the potential
therapeutic efficacy of honokiol analogs as a treatment strategy for RCC. In addition to primary positive impact
of our findings, potential outcomes may benefit treatment of other systemic problems associated with VHL
mutations, e.g. hemangioblastomas of retina and CNS. Finally, activation of the HIF pathway plays critical roles
in the development of many different cancer types at multiple stages. Evaluation of honokiol analogs as
inhibitors of the HIF pathway is expected to provide an important tool to further define the contribution of this
pathway in cancer development and resistance.
Relevance to Public Health: RCC is an important disease with ≈60,000 new cases predicted each year with
>13,000 deaths. The clear cell carcinoma are the most common form of RCC and making up nearly 70% of
cases. Unfortunately, cure for RCC is only available to those with limited stage disease which can be surgically
resected, as to date systemic therapies cannot eradicate the cancer if it has spread distantly. In advanced
stages, systemic therapies are given to stabilize the disease. No conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy agents
have demonstrated significant activity in this disease as monotherapy or combinations. Anti-VEGF therapies
have been largely ineffective, possibly due to contribution of other pro-angiogenic factors, such as EPO,
PDGF, etc. in RCC. Thus, there remains an unmet medical need to develop more effective treatments for
RCC. The proposed research will evaluate honokiol and its analogs as inhibitors of the HIF pathway and more
effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of RCC."

Up to 70% of patients with advanced cancer experience significant levels of FOP. FOP is the most common
psychosocial concern among GYN and other cancer survivors. Current FOP interventions are time, resource-
intensive, and administered by psychologists, limiting access and sustainability. Further, most have focused on
early-stage cancer. Advanced cancer patients are severely understudied. The “Day by Day” intervention was
adapted from “Conquer Fear,” which has shown effectiveness in reducing FOP in cancer survivors treated with
curative intent. The proposed intervention is the first to use a blended e-Health intervention to address FOP in
patients with advanced cancer. Our preliminary pilot studies established feasibility of a 1:1 nurse-led,
videoconferencing intervention in patients with stage III or IV gynecologic or lung. Based on our experience, we
adapted the intervention to a group and online format. We developed didactic, patient, and additional mindfulness
practice videos hosted on the website. We tailored the intervention to patients with advanced cancer, with a
focus on Acceptance and Commitment therapy because it addresses common existential concerns and values-
driven goals and actions. We will conduct a randomized pilot study to test the feasibility and efficacy of this
blended e-Health intervention in patients with stage 3 or 4 gynecologic cancer. The intervention consists of 2
group videoconferencing sessions, 3 web-based self-study modules, and a brief check-in call with the facilitator
(nurse or social worker). The intervention modules focus on the cancer experience, values and goal setting,
unhelpful beliefs about worry, skills practices, managing triggers, and important conversations. The Enhanced
Usual Care group will be delivered in the same format and consists of education only. Sessions focus on the
stress response, clinical trial participation, identifying reliable information online, and healthy lifestyle education.
Feasibility measures include enrollment rate, attrition, and attendance. Participants complete questionnaires
assessing FOP, distress, anxiety, metacognitions, and mindfulness at baseline, 6, and 10 weeks and an
evaluation survey at T2 or drop-out. Given the increasing number of survivors needing help with FOP and the
lack of trained clinicians, a multidisciplinary approach is needed to meet the demand. Implementing brief nurse
and social worker guided FOP interventions may be scalable and address barriers to accessing treatment.
Studies incorporating novel delivery models such as blended models will facilitate access and sustainability.
Further, including a group component can foster support and may be less resource intensive. This blended e-
Health intervention may offer high applicability to underserved communities where mental health providers are
scarce. Use of an e-health platform with group support may facilitate access, engagement, and sustainability."
10948044,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Kidneys play a central role in regulation of water-salt balance with excessive renal Na+ conservation being tightly
associated with hypertension. The existing diuretics inhibit Na+ reabsorption in individual renal tubule segments,
which often involves a compensatory response in other segments to limit their efficiency. Thus, targeting Na+
transporting systems in multiple segments simultaneously might represent a more effective way to fight
hypertension. Our groups generated abundant multicomponent evidence that exchange protein directly
activated by cAMP (Epac) isoforms 1 and 2 are critical regulators of renal Na+ handling in the proximal tubule
(PT) and the collecting duct (CD). Epac1 and Epac2 deletion compromises renal Na+ conservation in mice,
leading to reduced blood pressure during dietary Na+ restriction. This is associated with decreased activity and
expression of the sodium hydrogen exchanger-3 (NHE-3) in PT and epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) in CD.
Furthermore, RNAseq Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed an improvement of mitochondria function
and reduction in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in PT and CD upon Epac deletion. Interestingly,
renal Epac expression is drastically increased during hypertension arguing for deleterious ramifications of Epac
over-activation in driving Na+ retention and the development of elevated blood pressure. To this end, we have
developed novel pharmacological tools to selectively inhibit Epac isoform(s), and observed natriuretic actions of
these small molecules while exhibiting low toxicity and potent bioavailability profiles. Overall, we hypothesize
that Epac1 and Epac2 isoforms are physiologically relevant regulators of sodium reabsorption in both PT and
CD in response to hypovolemia. On the contrary, over-activation of Epac cascade contributes significantly to
the development of renal sodium retention and hypertension, in part by increasing ROS production and oxidative
stress. We propose that pharmacological inhibition of Epac signaling could be a novel, potent, and safe strategy
to counteract hypertension and improve renal function. We plan to test this with 3 specific aims:
SA1. Determine salt-sensitivity associated with Epac-induced changes on tubular transport in mice
lacking Epac isoforms to establish roles of renal and extra-renal components of Epac signaling. SA2.
Examine the molecular targets and signaling mechanisms of Epac-dependent regulation of Na+ transport
in the PT and CD. SA3. To test the hypothesis that Epac1 and 2 are effective therapeutic targets of
hypertension using optimized Epac specific inhibitors.
In summary, we develop this proposal by merging highly complementary and synergistic expertise in renal
physiology/epithelial transport and Epac signaling/drug discovery from neighboring laboratories of Dr.
Pochynyuk and Dr. Cheng within the Department of Integrative Biology and Pharmacology, UTHSC at Houston.
We anticipate to uncover previously unrecognized physiologically relevant means of Epac signaling in the kidney
and to establish the pharmacological potential of Epac blockade in treatment of hypertension."

Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has been accepted as an efficacious population-based
approach for lung cancer screening (LCS) based on findings from the National Lung Screening
Trial (NLST) which demonstrated a 20% reduction in lung cancer deaths. These findings and
subsequent recommendations from the US Preventative Services Task Force in December
2013 along with expanded guidelines in 2021, resulted in LCS via LDCT being implemented in a
variety of community and academic settings starting in 2014. However, as with any screening
program, there are concerns about the potential for LCS to lead to overdiagnosis of lung cancer.
Overdiagnosis is the detection of cancers through cancer screening that never would have been
diagnosed in the absence of cancer screening and would never lead to significant patient
morbidity or mortality in a patient’s lifespan if left untreated. Any diagnosis of lung cancer
generally causes the patient to engage in aggressive treatment and overdiagnosis may result in
anxiety, serious physical harm, unnecessary losses in quality of life, and financial health-care
costs. The variability, and uncertainty over the potential LCS-related harms, has led to extensive
debate regarding the balance between harms and benefits of LCS. Although the strongest
evidence for overdiagnosis comes from randomized control trials (RCTs) with long-term follow-
up, patients participating in RCTs are generally not representative of those in community-based
settings. Compared to NLST participants, individuals participating in community based LCS
settings are more likely to be older, to currently smoke, and have a high comorbid burden.
Specifically, participants receiving LCS care in community-based settings were more likely to
have COPD, asthma, bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis, diabetes, and hypertension compared
to NLST participants, thus increasing the likelihood of death from another disease before the
lung cancer progresses. These differences suggest that the magnitude of overdiagnosis may be
very different from estimates derived from RCTs. Observational studies are needed to provide a
source of robust evidence to inform the existence and magnitude of overdiagnosis in lung
cancer for individuals receiving LCS care outside of an RCT. As LCS participation continues to
evolve, this evidence is needed to inform future clinical and policy decision making. Therefore,
the primary objective of this study is to produce a range of estimates of overdiagnosis
among patients diagnosed with lung cancer who participated in the LCS process in
community-based healthcare settings."

Periodontal disease, a widespread global health issue, predominantly originates from dental
plaque, which an intricate polymicrobial biofilm. Within this milieu, Veillonella, an anaerobic,
Gram-negative bacterium, stands out for its unique ability to produce heme. Although this process
seems non-essential for Veillonella itself, it’s critical for its bacterial associates. Despite its
significance, the regulation of heme production in Veillonella and its impact on oral ecology remain
enigmatic. This study zeroes in on the symbiotic dance between Veillonella and the
periodontopathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), which relies heavily on heme as its primary
nutrient and is known to provoke inflammation via red blood cell breakdown. In the presence of
Pg, heme production in Veillonella is significantly induced. Intriguingly, this heme production
completely abolishes Pg’s hemolytic activity. This initial observation propels the hypothesis that
Veillonella’s heme production might strategically temper Pg’s hemolytic behaviors, presenting a
delicate balance with boarder implications for Pg-associated oral health. To rigorously dissect this
interplay, we’ve delineated two central aims. 1) Explore Mechanisms by which Veillonella Inhibits
Pg hemolysis. This will involve a comprehensive assay to discern the role of potential proteases
produced by Veillonella in suppressing Pg’s hemolytic attributes, with RNA-seq analysis and
transposon screening leading to a thorough insight. 2) Ascertain how the regulation of the heme
biosynthesis in Veillonella by Pg and its role in Pg-host interaction. Given the significance of
Veillonella’ heme production, understanding its regulation and impact on Pg’s interaction with the
host immune system is pivotal. This objective will use transwell assays, luciferase reporter strains,
Tn5 transposon library and in vitro tissue assays to provide a comprehensive view. In essence,
this research aspires to shed light on the nuances of oral biofilm ecology, emphasizing the yet-to
be-explored realm of Veillonella’s heme production. Unveiling the potential natural mechanism
where one bacterium regulates another’s inflammatory actions, our study could pave the way for
innovative periodontal treatments and a deeper grasp of dental biofilm interplay."
10952472,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Volumetric muscle loss (VML) is a debilitating condition that leads to chronic functional impairment
due to the irrecoverable loss of muscle tissue. There are no physical rehabilitation or surgical
standards of care for VML. As such, there is a critical need to develop therapeutics for muscle
regeneration. Animal model studies have shown that increased mechanical loading of muscle via
electrical stimulation or wheel running is a promising strategy for partially restoring function.
Specifically, electrically stimulated eccentric contraction (ESEC) training where the muscle-tendon
unit is elongated while the muscle is contracted has been most promising. Regardless of the
therapeutic approach to treating VML, and even more broadly to muscle function in general, there
are no techniques for noninvasively and directly measuring the in vivo force generating capacity
of muscle in animals. Shear wave tensiometry has recently been introduced as a noninvasive
technique for assessing in vivo muscle-tendon loading in humans. Loading is quantified by
tracking the vibrational behavior of propagating shear waves. While this technology has proven
useful in assessing muscle-tendon loading across a range of human health conditions, it has not
been scaled or evaluated in animal models, although it holds substantial potential in this context.
Accordingly, our overall objectives are to (1) develop a small animal tensiometer capable of
measuring reductions in in vivo muscle forces due to injury, and (2) determine the effectiveness
of ESEC on improving muscle force generation following injury. In Aim 1, we will develop a shear
wave tensiometer that integrates with our established rodent ankle dynamometer. Following VML
to the lateral gastrocnemius in a rodent model, wave speed via tensiometry and ankle torque via
dynamometry in injured animals will be compared to controls throughout recovery. This will mark
a pivotal first step in validating the effectiveness, accuracy, and reliability of tensiometry against
established methodologies in the field. In Aim 2, using the same VML model, ESEC will be applied
after injury to assess its effectiveness on improving functional and histological outcomes.
Successful completion of these aims holds dual significance. First, we will have validated the use
of tensiometry as a noninvasive, direct measure of in vivo muscle function in small animal models.
Long-term, we envision this technology as a wearable sensor to characterize muscle loading in a
wide range of animal models of disease, injury, development, and aging. Second, we will show
that ESEC training has the potential to make significant improvements in muscle function following
VML. This will set the stage for investigating synergist treatment strategies for VML when
combined with complementary therapeutics such as biomaterials or drugs."

People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are disproportionately affected by cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD is a
leading cause of death in T1D, contributing to 40% of mortality. Sleep is recognized by both the American
Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association as a critical health behavior to maintain glycemic
control and reduce CVD risk. Short and/or irregular sleep have been associated with reduced glycemic control
and non-dipping blood pressure in T1D, both of which are predictors of CV events. Emerging data suggest that
behavioral sleep interventions targeting short or irregular sleep led to improved glycemic parameters. However,
little is known about the mechanism by which improving sleep duration and/or regularity improves glycemic
control and reduces CV risk in T1D. Our group and others have shown that people with T1D often experience
poor sleep health, including inadequate sleep duration, sleep irregularity, and poor sleep quality. In particular,
studies from our lab have demonstrated that objectively measured sleep regularity (irregularity in sleep timing
or duration) is a strong predictor of glycemic control and insulin resistance. We have tested a behavioral sleep
intervention among adults with T1D and demonstrated improved sleep regularity and time spent in a desirable
glucose range from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Furthermore, we also found that poor self-reported
sleep quality in young T1D adults was associated with reduced flow mediated dilatation (FMD), a marker of
endothelial dysfunction. These observational studies demonstrate that the timing and quality of sleep are
related to key metabolic and CVD risk markers in T1D, but lack the detailed measurements and experimental
design needed to determine mechanisms. The goals of this proposal are to examine the mechanisms by which
improving sleep regularity through behavioral sleep intervention affects glycemic control and CVD risks in T1D
adults. We propose to extend our previous research by conducting a mechanistic study using a sleep stability
manipulation. We hypothesize that sleep stability impacts glycemic control and CV outcomes by improving
circadian regulation. We will conduct a 4-week behavioral sleep stability intervention in 80 T1D adults with
irregular sleep, utilizing a sleep pre/post design. Circadian regulation will be assessed by dim-light melatonin
onset (DLMO), melatonin metabolite amplitude (overnight urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels), actigraphy-
derived rest-activity rhythm, endothelial cell CLOCK gene mRNA expression, and known zeitgebers of the
central and peripheral circadian clocks (light exposure, meal timing). Main glycemic outcomes will be assessed
by CGM, A1C, and assessment of insulin sensitivity. Main CV outcomes will include 24h blood pressure and
endothelial FMD and other secondary vascular measures (pulse wave velocity, carotid intima media thickness,
and echocardiographic parameters). Sleep will be objectively recorded. All parameters will be measured at
baseline and end of intervention. This proposal will advance the understanding of mechanisms by which
improving sleep regularity influences glycemic control and cardiovascular risk in T1D."

Nature has evolved dynamic proteins that act as sensors, detecting changes in the environment and producing
signals that allow the cell to adapt and respond accordingly. For this function, signaling proteins must adopt
multiple conformations, affording switch-like behavior between “on” and “off” states. The specific mechanisms
by which states are switched or maintained often remain elusive due to a lack of biochemical and structural
information. Herein, I propose that protein design and engineering offer a unique approach to deconvolute these
complex biomolecular processes. Specifically, I aim to use protein design to generate minimal, tunable versions
of modular signaling subdomains and engineer them into wild-type signaling protein scaffolds. This allows for
direct assessment of thermodynamic or conformational signaling mechanisms by allowing us to measure the
effect of design changes on signaling outputs. For this proposal, bacterial histidine kinases offer a promising test
system due to 1) their highly modular scaffold that is amenable to chimera engineering and 2) the coiled-coil
core through which signal transduction is propagated, as coiled-coils are highly designable. In my preliminary
efforts, I have demonstrated for the first time that a histidine kinase can be re-wired with a de novo designed
sensor domain, allowing signal transduction to be initiated from a de novo part. The proposed research expands
upon this by applying protein sequence design to vary sensor domain stability, enabling insight into how sensor
stability (and thus, the thermodynamic gap between sensor domain “off” and “on” states) affects signaling output
(Aim 1). Moving down the histidine kinase scaffold, I then propose to use hyperstable de novo designed helical
bundles to drive the geometry (conformation) of the catalytic domain (Aim 2). By systematically varying the
geometry of the de novo bundle, I can force the kinase domain to adopt a related geometry. Then, by measuring
kinase activity of the de novo/kinase chimeras, I aim to identify geometric parameters at which the kinase domain
switches activity states. Finally, I propose to apply multi-state design to generate de novo linker domains that
can adopt multiple conformations (Aim 3). Engineering of de novo/natural chimeras and experimental
characterization of multi-state designed candidates will shed light on the sequence diversity that enables
accommodation of multiple conformations. Together, these efforts will provide significant mechanistic insight into
how histidine kinases undergo signal transduction while pushing the boundaries of function-guided protein
design."

Of the 150,000 individuals diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) each year, 15% will carry a hereditary
pathogenic germline variant (PGV) including some associated with syndromes (such as Lynch Syndrome and
Familial Adenomatous Polyposis) that are associated with a 35-100% lifetime risk of cancer. Identification of
these PGVs through germline genetic testing informs treatment, screening, and familial cascade testing to
reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality. In 2022, national guidelines expanded indications to
consider genetic testing in all patients with CRC, yet only 5.6% of CRC patients undergo genetic testing in the
US. Conventional pathways for genetic testing require non-genetic healthcare provider (NGHCP) referral to
genetic counselors, leading to several gaps where patients may fail to complete testing. Mainstream genetic
testing (MGT) has emerged as an effective pathway to increase rates of genetic testing in which NGHCPs
perform pre-test counseling and coordinate genetic testing. However, the national uptake of MGT has been
limited. The goal of this project is to increase the use of MGT in CRC by characterizing barriers to
implementing MGT for CRC and piloting a multi-level implementation strategy tailored to these barriers. We
will assess barriers among NGHCPs (i.e. surgeons, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists) and
institutional stakeholders (i.e. clinic nurses, clinic managers, genetic counselors) through semi-structured
qualitative interviews. Patient perceptions of MGT will be assessed using a sequential explanatory mixed
methods approach. CRC patients will be surveyed regarding perceptions of MGT and semi-structured
qualitative interviews will explore these preferences. Identified barriers/needs will be used to tailor a multi-level
implementation strategy consisting of provider education, technical assistance by genetic counselors, and
provision of patient education materials. The multi-level implementation strategy for MGT will be pilot tested at
two institutions in Alabama to determine patient level reach (clinical outcome) and provider perception of
acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility (survey data). This mentored research and a structured training
plan to gain expertise in implementation science and exposure to mixed methods will facilitate my career
development plan. My long-term goal is to use implementation science to improve outcomes in hereditary
colorectal cancer patients. The findings of this proposal will inform a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial
(R01 proposal) for implementing MGT in CRC patients and provide me a direct pathway to becoming an
independent investigator."
10952153,"Project Summary/Abstract
The brain ECM constitutes about 10-20% of the brain’s volume and plays a critical role in diverse brain
functions. In particular, the brain ECM regulates neuronal plasticity and behavior. Unlike collagen-based
peripheral ECMs, the structure of brain ECM is highly flexible and dynamically regulated by experience.
However, due to the technical limitations, the mechanism by which the brain’s ECM is organized and regulated
is poorly understood. We have developed a novel live-cell probe that labels hyaluronan-based brain ECM,
named H-Link. Sparse H-Link imaging shows that clustered ECM, such as perineuronal net (PNN), is not
limited to a specific neuronal type (PV interneurons) but also elaborately coats excitatory neurons in vivo and in
vitro. Furthermore, the application of H-Link to cultured neurons shows a striking specificity in ECM clustering
among different types of neurons and reveals its organization process on the neuronal surface, providing an
excellent platform for loss-of-function screens. Using this novel approach, we will identify cell-autonomous
neuronal ECM organizers and reveal the homeostatic and activity-dependent remodeling process of the brain’s
ECM. The tools and knowledge obtained from the proposed study will be a foundation for understanding the
cell-type-specific role of the brain’s ECM in neuronal plasticity and behavior."
10952384,"There are 21 different connexin isoforms in human that play crucial roles in intercellular
communication during development and physiology. At molecular level, six connexin proteins
assemble as hexamers to form an hemichannel that is inserted in the plasma membrane. The
docking of two hemichannels from adjacent cells form a gap junction channel (GJC); both
hemichannels and GJCs are permeable to ions and small metabolites (<1 kDa). Several human
connexin mutations and multiple pathological conditions exacerbate the activity of undocked
hemichannel causing cellular dysfunction. A major limitation in the field is the lack of adequate
pharmacological and genetic tools to dissect out the role of undocked connexin hemichannels
versus their functions as GJCs. The objective of this proposal is to create recombinant
nanobodies targeting Cx43 protein that differentially recognize hemichannels from GJCs to
overcome this technical barrier. These nanobodies have reduced size (15 kDa) allowing higher
tissue penetration, reduced immunogenicity and easy genetic manipulation and engineering. To
achieve this goal, we have selected peptides corresponding to extracellular regions, N-terminal
helix and intracellular loop of Cx43 protomer for llama immunization. To identify and generate
recombinant Cx43 nanobodies present in this serum, we will use the immunized llama’s B-cells
as source of nanobodies-coding RNA to produce a nanobodies-phage display library. The
selected nanobodies will be screening to recognize Cx43 via ELISA, Western blot and
immunofluorescence. In addition, we will assess the nanobodies capabilities to block Cx43
hemichannel activity in vitro and their wide applicability using heterologous expression system
and disease models. Considering the compelling evidence for a pathological role of Cx43
hemichannels in various diseases and our willingness to share the resulting antibodies with the
whole scientific community, the present project is highly innovative and significant."
10952672,"Project Summary / Abstract
Timely and coordinated hormonal levels are essential for establishing a natural early pregnancy. Therefore,
hormonal contraceptives have been employed as a main approach for female contraception. Our lab has been
studying uterine receptivity in mouse models. Uterine receptivity, a transient state in which the uterus can accept
an embryo to implant, is associated with two opposite major public health issues in reproductive women, infertility
and contraception. Defective uterine receptivity is a key maternal factor for infertility while blocking uterine re-
ceptivity is a main mechanism for female contraceptives. Although it is still not well-understood about the molec-
ular mechanism of how a uterus transforms into a receptive state for embryo implantation, it is well-established
that progesterone (P4) signaling is essential for the establishment of uterine receptivity in all mammals studied.
The action of P4 in the uterus is primarily mediated by progesterone receptor (PR), a nuclear transcription factor.
RU486 / Mifepristone is a mixed PR antagonist/agonist, has been used in numerous clinical applications, includ-
ing in termination of early pregnancy and as an emergency contraceptive. Our dose-response and time-course
study in mice, which have embryo attachment ~day 4.0 post-coitum (D4.0), reveals the inhibition/blockage of
embryo implantation by a single dose of RU486 (2-8 mg/kg) given on D2 @ 9 h ~ D3 @ 18 h, accompanied with
excessive uterine fluid retention, prominently in the 4-8 mg/kg groups. Uterine fluid has not been systemically
studied in infertile women. However, uterine fluid accumulation in hydrosalpinx patients and endometriosis pa-
tients is recognized to correlate with poor embryo implantation in IVF-ET. In mice, intraluminal infusion of non-
toxic fluid (0.9% saline) impairs embryo implantation. These studies show the adverse effect of uterine fluid
retention on embryo implantation. Since fluid retention is a “side effect” of hormonal contraceptives, and the
mechanisms for some of them, such as RU486, are not fully understood during different stages of early preg-
nancy, we hypothesize that dysregulation of uterine fluid is a mechanism for hormonal contraceptives, such as
RU486. We recently developed a novel method using Alexa Hydrazide (AH) to visualize uterine fluid absorption,
which is mainly through uterine luminal epithelium (LE) but not glandular epithelium (GE) during early pregnancy,
and demonstrated the inhibition of uterine bulk absorption in D3.5 LE by 8 mg/kg RU486 treated on D1.5 and
D2.5, supporting our hypothesis. Since uterine fluid movement is mainly through uterine epithelium and RU486
is a mixed PR antagonist/agonist, we have obtained a PR uterine epithelial conditional deletion mouse model,
epiPR-/- (Pgrf/-Wnt7aCre/+), for testing the hypothesis in two aims. Aim 1. Determine time-course effects of RU486
on uterine fluid absorption during early pregnancy. Aim 2. Determine channels in fluid movement regulated by
RU486 during early pregnancy. The proposed research will add uterine fluid dysregulation as a mechanism for
hormonal contraceptives and will provide molecular insights into channels in temporal uterine fluid dynamics
during early pregnancy for contraception and for treating infertility related to uterine fluid dysregulation."
10952683,"The key physicochemical properties of phase state, viscosity, and pH of aerosols and droplets impact both the
transmission of respiratory viruses and the efficacy of drug delivery to the lungs. Despite their critical role in
disease transmission and pulmonary drug delivery, a comprehensive understanding of these physicochemical
properties in fine and ultrafine aerosols is lacking. A major factor contributing to this knowledge gap is the
experimental challenge of measuring these properties in aerosols due to the small particle sizes and the
sensitivity of the particles to sampling, which can alter their properties. Current techniques used to study particle
physicochemical properties are generally limited to larger supermicron particles, require the perturbative
sampling of particles onto a substrate, and/or are only able to measure one relevant property. This proposal
seeks to bridge this knowledge gap by developing a single, fluorescence-based experimental apparatus capable
of in situ measurements of the phase state, viscosity, and pH of size-resolved fine and ultrafine respiratory and
drug aerosol particles. In Aim 1, we will develop the fluorescence apparatus and establish the basis for
measurement for each of these three properties. The incorporation of solvatochromic probe molecules will
enable the measurement of the phase state, molecular rotors will enable the measurement of viscosity, and pH-
indicators will enable the measurement of pH. Because the physicochemical properties of aerosols can vary with
particle size, we will integrate efficient size-selection with the fluorescence spectrometer to enable size-
dependent measurements in Aim 2. Standard electrical mobility-based methods for size-selecting fine and
ultrafine particles are hampered by distortions caused by larger multiply charged particles that share the same
electrical mobility as smaller singly charged particles. This proposal aims to overcome this limitation by combining
inertial impaction and electrical mobility to enable size-selection while retaining sufficient particle volumes for
fluorescence measurements. In Aim 3, we will develop techniques to incorporate probe molecules into pre-
existing aerosols to enable the eventual characterization of particles generated by individuals or preformulated
drugs. This aim will explore two distinct methods for achieving this incorporation: aerosolization of the probe
molecule itself, followed by controlled coagulation between probe-molecule particles and target particles, and
direct volatilization of probe molecules using semi-volatile probe molecules assisted by thermal or laser heating.
Taken together, the successful completion of these aims will provide proof of concept for a versatile measurement
platform capable of characterizing the key size-dependent physicochemical properties of fine and ultrafine
respiratory and drug aerosols. The capabilities of this new measurement platform will enable the elucidation of
the temperature- and relative humidity-dependent physicochemical properties of these particles. This
understanding has the potential to transform our ability to predict and control the spread of respiratory viruses
and enhance the precision and efficacy of drug therapies for respiratory and systemic diseases."
10951958,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 While breast cancer prognosis has substantially improved over the last three decades, recurrence
remains a significant risk, particularly for African American patients and patients from low- and middle-income
countries (LMIC). Novel interventions are needed to prevent cancer recurrence and reduce mortality. Increasing
evidence suggests that the gut microbiota may influence the efficacy of cancer therapy, thus impacting cancer
prognosis. On the other hand, cancer treatment, particularly chemotherapy, may lead to dysbiosis of the gut
microbiota and changes in bacterial metabolic activities. These alterations might persist beyond the time of
treatment, resulting in a reduction in beneficial bacteria, thereby influencing long-term breast cancer outcomes.
Thus, gut microbiota is a potential target to improve the efficacy of cancer treatment and long-term health
outcomes in breast cancer patients. However, the impact of cancer therapy, particularly chemotherapy, on gut
microbiota after the completion of therapy, as well as the influence of gut microbiota on long-term breast
cancer survival, is largely unknown. To address these knowledge gaps, we propose conducting a pilot study to
evaluate the associations of pre- and post-chemotherapy and -radiotherapy gut microbiome profiles with breast
cancer recurrence and mortality (Aim 1). We will use the existing pre-systematic treatment gut microbiome
data from 364 cases and perform shotgun metagenome sequencing on 110 post-chemotherapy or/and -
radiotherapy stool samples in the Vietnam Breast Cancer Study (VBCS). We will also investigate the impact of
chemotherapy on the gut microbiome profile (Aim 2). We will examine changes in gut microbial diversity, taxa
abundance, microbial metabolic pathways, and microbiome dysbiosis indexes among 110 breast cancer
patients with paired pre- and post-chemotherapy stool samples. This proposed study will be the first to
evaluate the associations of pre- and post-systemic treatment gut microbiome profiles, as well as their gut
microbiome dysbiosis indexes, with the risk of breast cancer recurrence and mortality at 5 years post-
diagnosis. Findings from this proposed study will support the launch of a full-scale study to fully understand the
role of gut microbiota in breast cancer outcomes, eventually leading to the development of a microbial-based
intervention to improve long-term cancer outcomes and quality of life for survivors."
10952790,"Many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and the
polyglutamine diseases, result from protein misfolding and accumulation due to a variety of genetic
and/or environmental causes. Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult-onset, inherited
neuromuscular disease that is caused by polyglutamine expansion within the androgen receptor (AR);
it is related to other neurodegenerative diseases caused by polyglutamine expansion, including
Huntington’s disease and several spinocerebellar ataxias. Although the precise pathway leading to
neuronal dysfunction and death is unknown, the evaluation of transgenic mouse and cell models of
these diseases has yielded mechanistic insights to disease pathogenesis. SBMA stands apart from
other polyglutamine diseases in that its onset and progression are dependent on AR androgenic
ligands. Many cell and mouse models of SBMA reproduce the androgen- and polyglutamine-dependent
nuclear AR aggregation seen in patients, as well as its consequent toxicity, making these models highly
useful for the analysis of the mechanistic basis for upstream events involved in AR toxicity. Our long-
term objectives are to use these models to develop a mechanistic understanding of steps in SBMA
pathogenesis that occur in response to hormone binding and to develop therapeutic approaches based
on that understanding. Such studies previously revealed that a specific conformational state, the
interaction between the amino (N)- and carboxyl (C)- terminal ends of the AR that occurs upon hormone
binding (N/C interaction), is required for its aggregation and toxicity; inhibition of the N/C interaction by
genetic or pharmacologic means is protective both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we found that not only
is Ser-16 hyperphosphorylated upon preventing the AR N/C interaction but this phosphorylation is
required for protection, as mutation of Ser-16 to the un-phosphorylatable amino acid Alanine abrogated
the neuroprotection. We propose in this application to further understand the mechanism underlying the
role of Ser-16 phosphorylation in disease by identifying the kinase responsible for Ser-16
phosphorylation (Aim 1) and using this information to explore the impact of Ser-16 phosphorylation on
AR metabolism and SBMA-related cellular and biochemical phenotypes (Aim 2). We anticipate that
results from these studies will lead us to a new understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of SBMA
and enhance our development of new therapies for SBMA."

While hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is an effective curative treatment for children with various malignant
and non-malignant diseases, it is also associated with several complications, such as oral mucositis (OM) and
bloodstream infections (BSI). The loss of mucosal integrity in OM not only results in ulcerative lesions that are a
significant source of pain, but also, the compromised mucosal barrier becomes susceptible to bacterial
translocation and predisposes patients to BSI. Several studies have reported disruptions of the oral microbiome
in patients undergoing HCT, and this was linked to OM. In addition, bacterial species present in the oral cavity
(i.e., viridans group streptococci) have been implicated in BSI. While this establishes the role of oral microbial
species in OM and BSI pathogenesis, nearly all of this research is limited to adults, despite the high prevalence
of OM (70-80%) and BSI (15-65%) in children. Furthermore, the current standard for diagnosing BSI is culture-
based method that is not comprehensive or high enough resolution to distinguish all species, including the oral
streptococci. It is crucial to accurately define the blood microbial signature of this high-risk cohort to determine if
the oral cavity is a reservoir of organisms causing BSI, and if so, to guide preventive approaches. For Aim 1 we
will conduct a longitudinal study in children undergoing HCT at Nationwide Children’s Hospital to understand the
impact of oral microbial species during the development and progression of OM and BSI. Our pilot study revealed
overall microbial community composition changed as children underwent HCT. We will now expand our sample
size to define the oral microbial community changes at the species level and determine the relationship of these
changes to oral mucositis and bloodstream infections. Site-specific oral samples (plaque, tongue, mucosa) will
be collected at a minimum of four time points. Both species level bacterial and fungal composition by 16S/ITS2
amplicon sequencing, and absolute abundance by qPCR will be analyzed. OM incidence and severity will be
scored, and all BSI occurrences will be recorded. The relationship of microbial community composition with time
course, oral hygiene, OM score, and BSI occurrence will be examined. Our preliminary 16S amplicon data
revealed polymicrobial profiles containing microbial species common to the oral cavity in the bloodstream of
subjects with BSI. For Aim 2 we will comprehensively define the bloodstream microbial profile in children
receiving HCT by longitudinally collecting blood samples from all subjects and comparing their bloodstream
microbial profile in the presence and absence of BSI. To determine if the oral cavity is the likely source of
bloodstream infection-associated microbes, we will use high-resolution bioinformatic tools (DADA2) on our
amplicon data and analyze the concordance of species detected in blood samples with those detected in the
oral cavity. The most likely oral source (plaque, tongue or mucosa) will also be examined. The results of these
studies will inform future preventive and therapeutic strategies to reduce OM and BSI burden. They will also lay
a foundation for future investigations of therapies and mechanistic studies of bloodstream invasive oral microbes."
10952847,"Adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors represent a growing population due to recent advances in
cancer treatment. AYA survivors, defined by the National Cancer Institute as aged 15-39 years, experience a
high burden of chronic health conditions, and they face devastating financial toxicity, defined as the negative
personal financial impact of healthcare costs. Financial toxicity results not only from the cost of care, but also
from unmet health-related social needs (HRSN: food insecurity, un/underinsurance, unstable housing,
suboptimal education, and unemployment). Historically minoritized AYAs (Black, Hispanic/Latino, poverty-
exposed AYAs) disproportionately experience adverse social determinants of health that are associated with
poorer health outcomes. We are currently testing an adapted adult model of financial navigation intervention
for Spanish and English-speaking AYAs with cancer who screen positive for financial toxicity or unmet HRSN.
As in the adult model, our intervention is delivered in partnership with a nonprofit organization that provides
telephone-based case management and needs navigation to people with life-limiting illnesses. In our study,
AYAs are interested and consent to participate, however, uptake and sustained engagement with the
intervention model are rarely observed. We now propose to refine our current, low-technology model to a
digital platform and add vocational navigation to better engage AYAs and address their unmet HRSN.
Findhelp.org is an established, digital network of local resources, such as community organizations, that
provide specific support to address HRSN (e.g., insurance navigation, transportation, SNAP benefit support).
Further, our clinical vocational liaison team are established and able to conduct standardized consultations and
referrals to address vocational needs. We will used iterative co-design focus group sessions to refine our
needs navigation model (AYA-NAV) to address these needs (Aim 1) and then, conduct a pilot randomized trial
among 80 AYAs with financial toxicity or unmet HRSN, to evaluate the feasibility of AYA-NAV (Aim 2), and
explore the preliminary impact of AYA-NAV delivered over 6 months on AYA financial and global health
outcomes, compared to enhanced usual care (one-time referral to findhelp.org) (Aim 3). To achieve the aims of
this study, we will use a mixed-methods approach and leverage our study team, expert advisors, and
consultants representing AYAs, caregivers, clinicians, community partners, and human-centered design
evaluation. This study is in alignment with the National Institute of Nursing Research’s strategic goals to
advance health equity and to reduce disparities among individuals experiencing adverse determinants of
health. We have an outstanding team of experts with expertise in nursing science, medicine, AYA psychology
and oncology, health outcome disparities, human-centered design, cancer care delivery, and mixed methods,
and thus, we are uniquely positioned for success. Our line of research has the potential to address critical
understudied inequities in care delivery, improving quality of life and health outcomes for AYAs with cancer."

The human genome organization inﬂuences gene regulation. Aberrant nuclear structures observed in cancer and
conservation of common features of genome organization, such as A/B compartments, topologically associated
domains, and loops across mammalian evolution, further hint at its role in gene regulation. Yet scientists are only
beginning to understand the sequence determinants and regulatory implications of nuclear DNA organization.
Next-generation sequencing assays such as Hi-C, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq assist in this task by measuring
genome-wide biochemical activities. However, each of these three assays provides only a partial snapshot of
regulatory interactions, and the lack of successful integration has hindered our understanding of the impact of
nuclear organization on critical biological functions.
The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify the functional consequences of variations in nuclear archi-
tecture on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation and the role of this variation in human health and
disease. Speciﬁcally, Aim 1 proposes to identify the sequence determinants of Hi-C contacts using novel deep
learning models that predict Hi-C contacts from nucleotide sequences across 80 human tissues (K99 phase).
Additionally, Aim 2 proposes to learn the rules of chromatin organization shared across evolution using a deep
learning model for translating between Hi-C and ATAC-seq across 100 mammalian species (K99 phase). Finally,
Aim 3 proposes to model the impact of variations in the nuclear organization on tissue-speciﬁc transcriptional and
post-transcriptional regulation in humans using machine learning, long-read RNA-seq, and Hi-C (R00 phase).
Together, this work will provide novel, open-source, and interpretable machine learning models to enable the
discovery and quantiﬁcation of the regulatory causes and functional consequences of nuclear DNA organization in
healthy human tissues and misregulation of this architecture in disease. The models, resources, and skills learned
during Aims 1 and 2 (K99 phase) will be used to accomplish Aim 3 during the R00 phase. The candidate aims
to establish an independent research program that bridges the gap between experimental and computational
research into genome architecture and gene regulation. She will receive the interdisciplinary training needed
from her mentor, Dr. William Noble and her postdoctoral advisory committee, Drs. Erez Lieberman Aiden, William
Greenleaf, Anshul Kundaje, and Sheng Wang. In addition, she will participate in career development activities
offered through the University of Washington. Her research training, mentor, advisory committee, and academic
environment will prepare her well as she transitions to an independent position as an academic researcher."
10952675,"Much is unknown of mechanisms of bacteriophage resistance and susceptibility in
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and are still unsolved. Studies have provided useful
classification schemes, such as whole genome sequencing and spoligo typing using DNA
sequences. Unfortunately, DNA sequencing has not provided a clear understanding or basis for
explaining the biology of phage typing or phage/host interactions in Mycobacterium tuberculosis
at a time when phage therapy may provide a possible solution to treatment in the face of the
ongoing problem of the worldwide drug resistant epidemic in tuberculosis. Bacteriophages have
the potential to provide a new molecular approach for treating drug-resistant tuberculosis.
However, in order to develop these effective phage therapies, we need to better understand the
biology of phage-host interactions in Mtb.
In this study, we propose to examine phage-host interactions using an established stock of
phages from decades-old archived collection of Mtb phages. This will be accomplished through
three specific aims: 1) Determine the similarities and differences that determine phage host
range. We will characterize the distinctive properties of these phages by their host range
limitations, morphological and DNA sequencing differences and similarities, and phage
attachment properties. 2) Identify CRISPR sites within the host genome that confer immunity.
We will concentrate on host properties by searching for novel restriction enzymes, receptors
and CRISPR sites that maybe associated with phage resistance. 3) Evaluate how host lineages
impact susceptibility/resistance to phage. We will compare the phages to Mtb host genome
sequences among and within well-established lineages to look for patterns of phage interaction.
Our findings have the potential to establish a new understanding of phage-host interactions in
Mtb. This knowledge will be used to ultimately develop new directions for phage-based
therapies to treat drug-resistant tuberculosis."
10952781,"FLASH radiotherapy utilizing ultra-high dose rate has the potential of being a substantial evolutionary
advancement for cancer treatment. Ultra-high dose rate radiation provides a benefit of decreased normal
tissue toxicities while maintaining equivalent tumor killing effect. Among different modalities, particle therapy
has been an active area of research to integrate its unique characteristics with the FLASH effect because
proton therapy remains the only clinically assessable modality that can potentially treat deep seated tumors
under FLASH conditions. Thus, developing methods to enable FLASH proton therapy with clinically available
accelerators is an important step to both unravel the biological mechanism using preclinical studies, clinical
trials as well as explore the physical hardware requirements for clinical implementation.
 In FLASH proton therapy, beam modulation devices are important accessories for enabling ultra-fast
dose delivery based on the clinically available cyclotrons and synchrocyclotron systems. These work by
transforming an ultra-high dose rate mono-energetic proton pencil to a multi-energy spot after passing through
varying thicknesses of modulating material. In this way, a multi-energy layer pencil beam scanning proton plan
can be delivered completely in less than a second without the need for beam pausing for energy switching.
The most common modulator is the ridge filter, which consists of uniform density spikes of varying height. The
limitation of this design includes restricted structure stability and modulation flexibility.
We propose to develop a new class of heterogeneous density range modulators based on the novel
PixelPrint technology, to facilitate FLASH therapy. By continuously varying the ratio of filament to air, PixelPrint
technology is capable of 3D printing phantoms with voxel-wise heterogeneous density. By utilizing material
density as an optimization parameter, the new devices will have robust structure and high flexibility in
modulation. The hypothesis is that the 3D printed heterogeneous density modulator degrades the beam
energy across the transverse plane of the particle beam, based on both local material density and the
stopping power distribution of the material. With greater flexibility compared to current binary modulation
only design, complex modulation is achievable for application in universal range modulator and patient-specific
modulators. Our deliverables will include design methods to optimize density structures for range modulation,
and experimentally validated modulators for proton FLASH therapy applications. The specific aims are:
Aim 1. Development of density optimization algorithms for range modulation.
Aim 2. Experimental validation and characterization of 3D printed heterogeneous range modulators.
Aim 3. Development of patient-specific modulators for Proton FLASH therapy.
If successful, the approach will enable a new class of range modulators to enable FLASH particle therapy with
flexible assembly and patient-specific modulation."
10952071,"Project Summary
Macrophages (MΦ) respond to pathogens, tissue damage, and host-derived mediators by differentiating into distinct functional phenotypes that mediate host innate immune responses. “Classically activated” (M1) MΦ are highly microbicidal, yet their inflammatory products also damage host tissue. In contrast, “alternatively activated” (M2) MΦ subsets, including IL-4- and IL-13-induced “M2a MΦ,” resolve tissue damage through anti-inflammatory mechanisms. The Blanco laboratory has worked to study host responses to Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and influenza, significant causes of severe lower respiratory tract infection. In wild-type (WT) mice, RSV infection elicits an early, transient M1 MΦ response in the lung followed by a sustained period of M2 MΦ predominance, and ultimately, resolution of lung pathology. RSV-infected IL-4Ra-/- mice, whose MΦ lack a common receptor chain for IL-4 and IL-13, fail to differentiate into M2a MΦ and exhibit greatly enhanced lung pathology that is overcome by adoptive transfer of WT MΦ that differentiate into M2a MΦ. However, influenza infection fails to elicit a sufficient M2a MΦ response to override a strongly inflammatory M1 MΦ response, resulting in severe lung pathology. The transcription factor Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPARg), a nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) required for M2a MΦ differentiation, forms heterodimers with another NHR, Retinoid X Receptor (RXR), and binds sites within M2a MΦ gene promoters to activate transcription. We found that therapeutic treatment of influenza-infected mice or cotton rats with the PPARg agonist ligand, pioglitazone, suppressed M1 MΦ gene expression, enhanced M2a MΦ differentiation, protected mice against influenza- induced lethality, and mitigated lung pathology and inflammatory mediator production in both mice and cotton rats. Treatment of WT MΦ with IL-4 in the presence of RXR ligand, in combination with PPARg ligand, synergized for induction of the prototype M2a marker, Arginase 1, at the level of mRNA and protein, suggesting that the RXR agonist may exert additional therapeutic effects in vivo by enhancing M2a MΦ differentiation. Our central hypothesis is that attaining the appropriate balance between these two opposing innate MΦ responses, M1 and M2, is key to development of efficacious therapies for viral-induced acute lung injury. This hypothesis will be tested initially by screening RXR ligands that were previously used in vivo to identify the most potent IL-4 co- activator(s) of M2a MΦ in the absence or presence of PPARg ligand. The therapeutic efficacy of lead PPARg/RXR ligand combinations will be tested on influenza- or RSV-infected cotton rats, a rodent model that is uniquely susceptible to non-adapted strains of RSV and influenza. Completion of these studies is expected to provide strong evidence for the efficacy of new therapies against viral-induced lung inflammation based on our ground- breaking results showing a synergistic MΦ response to liganded RXR in the presence of PPARg ligands."

function. Changes in Kir4.1 have been implicated in epilepsy, seizures, and several neurodegenerative
disorders. However, until recently it was thought that outside of pathological conditions K+e rises would be small
and cleared slowly, with their effects on neurons unclear. We recently showed that presynaptic neuronal activity
induces fast, large, and highly focal astrocyte depolarizations driven by localized increases in extracellular
potassium (K+e) and blunted by Kir4.1 activity. This raises new questions that we seek to address about how
astrocyte K+ buffering and Kir4.1 affect neuronal activity. We hypothesize that interneurons are specifically
sensitive to changes in K+e and Kir4.1 buffering, affecting their excitability, synaptic function, and network activity
while having only small effects on excitatory neurons. Interneurons are fast spiking neurons, potentially leading
to focal K+e accumulation. Interneuron action potential waveforms depend on a fast, and large
afterhyperpolarization to enable their fast spiking frequencies, potentially making them sensitive to changes in
K+e. Preliminary data suggests that GABA clearance and GABAergic network activity are modulated by Kir4.1.
Interneuron activity, especially of parvalbumin interneurons play a crucial role in ictal activity, able to both restrain
ictal activity and pathologically enhance its spread. We hypothesize that K+e enhances PV-hyperactivity and
enhances ictal spread in an in-vitro model of seizure. Conversely, Kir4.1 will inhibit this ictal activity, acting
through PV-INs. If successful this proposal would give a better understanding of how K+e and astrocytic
potassium buffering through Kir4.1 affects neuronal activity, especially GABAergic activity. This can lead to a
better understanding of how Kir4.1 and astrocytes contribute to pathological conditions."

Three major training objectives underlie the program. Over the course of a summer, each of the OHIP
trainees gains an understanding of the:
· importance of work-related health and safety hazards in determining the health of workers and the
 general community;
· changing nature of the workforce and importance of designing health and safety interventions to
 meet the needs of specific and diverse worker groups; and
· role of occupational health and safety professionals in reducing workplace health and safety hazards.
OHIP project personnel and mentors from around the country, each with considerable health and safety
experience, work to ensure that the internships will be successful. This includes extensive national
recruitment for applicants, careful selection of student projects, organization of a three-day national
orientation training, and effective mentorship and supervision throughout the summer. Post-summer
communication with the trainees solidifies their interest in occupational health. A national advisory board
composed of nationally recognized educators and scientists continues to play a key role in overseeing the
program.
Over the past 20 years, 392 students have completed 205 occupational safety and health (OSH)
projects with 136 worker support organizations in 30 locations involving a wide variety of occupations
and health and safety hazards. Over the previous NIOSH funded project period (2018 – 2023), 108 students
have completed 54 projects in 18 locations. Over the past 20 years, 55 percent of the 392 OHIP trainees
have been URMs and over 50 percent of these have pursued careers in OHS and/or allied professions.
Over the last 5-year project period, 65 of 108 OHIP trainees (60%) are URM."

Despite the apparent uniform cytoarchitecture of the cerebellar cortex, imaging studies have revealed
discrete functional domains within it. We have recently identified numerous Purkinje cell (PC) subtypes that
occupy discrete domains of the developing mouse cerebellar cortex, providing a basis for the functional
parcellation of the cerebellar cortex. Climbing fibers, which originate from individual inferior olive (IO) nuclei,
specifically target PCs within different domains of the cerebellar cortex. A significant knowledge gap exists
regarding the molecular heterogeneity of IO neurons and the mechanisms governing their diversification.
Preliminary data suggest the crucial role of transcription factor Foxp2 in diversifying PCs and IO neurons,
leading us to hypothesize analogous heterogeneity in climbing fiber neurons. To test this hypothesis, we
propose an innovative strategy integrating single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell resolved spatial protein
profiling to develop a three-dimensional molecular atlas of the developing IO, under normal conditions and
in the absence of Foxp2. Aim 1 is centered on constructing a 3D molecular atlas of the developing IO, while
Aim 2 investigates the impact of Foxp2 loss on IO development. We anticipate that the completion of these
aims will yield a detailed spatial molecular atlas of the IO and will provide insights into the molecular
regulation of IO nucleus formation by Foxp2. This research will not only bridge the existing knowledge gap
regarding IO neurons but also enhance our understanding of the discrete connectivity and function of
different domains within the cerebellar cortex."

Perinatal depression (PND) affects nearly 20% of pregnant and postpartum women, with estimates soaring
above 30% during the COVID-19 pandemic. Prospective data show insomnia precedes over half of PND
incidence and relapse cases more than doubling risk for major depression. This is highly significant to a large
segment of the pregnant population as ~20% of women meet diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder by the end
of pregnancy. Fortunately, insomnia is a modifiable risk factor for PND, and insomnia may serve as an entry
point to prevent PND incidence and relapse. Although cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) alleviates
insomnia during pregnancy, it yields modest effects on PND and undertreats cognitive arousal (heightened
cognitive activity, particularly in the forms of rumination and worry at night). Our team identified cognitive arousal
as a promising candidate factor for alleviating insomnia and preventing depression via insomnia therapy. Indeed,
undertreatment of cognitive arousal in pregnancy is associated with insomnia non-remission and continued
depression after therapy. Moreover, patient stakeholders identify ‘calming a busy mind at night’ as a critical target
for improving sleep and wellbeing during pregnancy. In effort to enhance alleviation of cognitive arousal to
optimize clinical outcomes, we developed Perinatal Understanding of Mindful Awareness for Sleep (PUMAS).
PUMAS places behavioral sleep strategies within a mindfulness intervention framework with all components
tailored specifically for pregnancy. RCT data show that PUMAS yields large effects on insomnia, depression,
and cognitive arousal relative to control, whereas CBTI alleviates insomnia but has mixed or minimal effects on
PND and cognitive arousal. Our R34 pilot RCT shows PUMAS patients are more satisfied with their care than
pregnant women treated with CBTI, and that clinic leadership and providers rate PUMAS as acceptable, feasible,
and appropriate for implementation. PUMAS has immense potential to change the management of prenatal
insomnia and to curb PND rates via preventive care. We propose a large-scale RCT of 500 women with DSM-5
insomnia disorder (without PND) who are randomized to PUMAS or sleep education control. We will evaluate
the effectiveness of PUMAS for alleviating insomnia and preventing PND across pregnancy and the first
postpartum year. This project will not only test PUMAS effectiveness for insomnia and PND prevention but will
also investigate whether PUMAS engages a key candidate mechanism (high cognitive arousal) that is operative
for addressing these clinical outcomes in the effectiveness context (PAR-21-130). We will recruit pregnant
women from the 23 women’s health clinics and 5 maternal-fetal medicine clinics across HFH, centrally located
in Metro Detroit. This application directly addresses research objectives under PAR-21-130, which states:
“preventive and therapeutic interventions [should target] factors that have been empirically associated with risk
for or the etiology, maintenance, severity/course of the disorder or condition of interest.”"

The proposed project aims to develop the first-ever data-driven autonomous gaze coach for robot-assisted
minimally invasive surgical (RAMIS) virtual reality simulation training. A surgeon’s skill level is correlated with
patient outcomes. It is known that expert surgeons adopt different gaze patterns from novices, and that gaze
training is a proven, but labor-intensive coaching method that improves a trainee surgeon’s surgical skills,
especially under stress. Our proposed coaching system will increase the accessibility of high-quality gaze
coaching, even in areas where there is a shortage of expert instructors, and will free up valuable time for surgical
experts for clinical and higher-order instructional work. The acceleration of skill acquisition, will, in turn, decrease
the time and cost for training competent surgeons across the country.
The project will comprise three specific aims. In Aim 1 we collect gaze and performance data from experts and
novices in six virtual reality RAMIS drills. We will analyze the data to find good candidate drills in which to develop
our autonomous gaze coaches by identifying those in which expert performance and gaze patterns differ most
from those of novices. In Aim 2, we use the data collected in Aim 1 to train expert gaze-synthesizing neural
networks that can generate a fixation point or a gaze map given surgical video streams. We validate the networks’
abilities to replicate expert gaze using a held-out test set. In Aim 3 we develop approaches to display the gaze
synthesized by the neural networks from Aim 2 and test the effectiveness of our gaze coaching system to improve
the surgical skills of novices. Outcome skill measures of this user performance study are the surgical skill
measures such as economy of motion and the completion time, and task-specific penalties. These include
instrument and apparatus collisions, dropping of apparatus, instruments out-of-view, durations of excessive force
application, wrong energy application, dissection outside of defined zones, and repeated needle pierces.
Outcome gaze measures include the increase in the amount of overlap between the novice gaze and expert
gaze after training, and the increase in time spent focusing on expert-defined areas of interest in the surgical
scene. The results of this development and validation of the system in virtual reality simulation will inform our
long-term goal of developing autonomous gaze coaching systems for use in more complex clinical-like training
scenarios, such as cadaver or porcine models."

Kainate receptors (KARs) are a type of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) found in the mammalian central
nervous system (CNS). These receptors mediate excitatory neurotransmission, which is essential for normal
brain function. Native KARs form heteromeric complexes consisting of primary (GluK1-3) and secondary (GluK4-
5) subunits, each contributing unique functional characteristics to KARs. In humans, perturbation in KAR
functions or novel genetic variations causing either loss or gain of function in KAR subunits have been associated
with neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as intellectual disability, movement disorders, and
epilepsy. Consequently, KARs represent a set of potential targets for therapeutic interventions, and it is
imperative to gain a deep understanding of the structural and functional characteristics that govern the behavior
of KARs. So far, the structural details about the open state of KARs are unavailable; hence, the mechanism of
ion permeation through KARs remains poorly understood. However, the Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)
structures of KARs showed that ligand binding domain (LBD) in the desensitized state of KARs separate from
each other, compared to other iGluRs, indicating that LBDs in KARs are susceptible to dissociation in continuous
presence of agonist. Therefore, this research proposes to investigate the structural aspects of KARs using a
(Aim 1) non-desensitizing mutant GluK2-D776K and (Aim 2) a de novo gain-of-function variant GluK2-A657T
using cryo-EM. The GluK-D776K is expected to stabilize the LBD to facilitate the capture of the open state of
KAR. In contrast, GluK2-A657T results in the constitutive activity or the 'channel leakiness' without ligand binding
and is associated with ataxia, speech, and mental disabilities. The expected outcome of this proposal will uncover
the architectural and conformational changes in KARs and the mechanism of ion permeation through KARs in
an agonist-dependent and independent manner. The obtained structural insights will also facilitate the design of
selective KAR inhibitors for neurological disorders."

The sharing of data in biomedical research, including data generated from clinical trials, is paramount for
ensuring reproducibility, improving study design, increasing analytic power via concatenation of disparate data
sets, and identifying and testing new hypotheses. With more data being made publicly available, there is a critical
need to facilitate their re-use. The reusability of publicly available clinical trial datasets is more complex when
data are shared in an unstructured format, as compared to in a structured database, due to the need for arduous
manual annotation of individual files to permit secondary analyses. One platform to share individual participant
level clinical trial data is the Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort), a NIH/NIAID-funded public
warehouse providing open access to clinical and mechanistic data from immunological and clinical studies.
The overall aim of this proposal is to enhance the reusability of clinical trial data shared through ImmPort and to
encourage their re-use. Specifically, the goal is to develop an automated tool to simplify the transformation of
laboratory test data from clinical trials into the format of the ImmPort submission template. Upload of the data in
this template format is necessary for integration into the structured database. Otherwise, the data will be made
available to the public as custom formatted study files, complicating their re-use. The complexity in current upload
protocols is what prevents many data submitters from fully annotating their clinical data for integration into
ImmPort’s structured database. The tool will be an extension of our prototype ImmPort curation approach that
facilitates the formatting of assessment data for submission to ImmPort. The tool will rely on a manually curated
data dictionary to give context to the data in the study files. With that data dictionary and minimal additional
manual input, the approach automates the complex file formatting steps required to transform the data into the
laboratory test submission template. The tool will be developed to guide users through the annotation process
with a graphical user interface, making full annotation of lab test clinical trial data more accessible to researchers
without informatics expertise.
Additionally, to increase confidence and proficiency in re-using clinical study data publicly available through
ImmPort, a comprehensive tutorial based on a secondary analysis of two food allergy related clinical trials shared
through ImmPort will be developed. The tutorial, created in R, will cover various ways of data retrieval,
processing, and an in-depth analysis with visualizations. Overall, this proposal aims to enhance the reusability
of clinical trial data available through ImmPort, thereby increasing the return on investment for biomedical
research and benefiting scientific knowledge and clinical care."

Pancreatic β-cells are specialized to carry out high capacity mRNA translation that is tightly regulated by the
nutrient environment. However, these features expose β-cells to several vulnerabilities, including deleterious
endoplasmic reticulum stress and translation errors that can can result in production of defective ribosome
products (DRIPs), which have been implicated in autoimmunity in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Whereas, acute glucose
exposure robustly increases translation of insulin and other secretory granule proteins, chronic high glucose
decreases insulin translation and secretion even prior to impact on global translation or upregulation of
endoplasmic reticulum stress. To determine the extent of translational changes at this early stage of β-cell
dysfunction, I used ribosome profiling and nascent proteomics in MIN6 insulinoma cells to elucidate the genome-
wide impact of sustained high glucose on β-cell mRNA translation. Sustained high glucose conditions that
suppressed insulin secretion downregulated translation of insulin and proteins, such as SCGN, IDH2, VPS41,
SLC2A2, IGF2, SLC30A8 and PFKFB3, which are involved in insulin secretory granule formation, exocytosis,
and metabolism-coupled insulin secretion. Translation of these mRNAs was also downregulated in primary rat
and human islets following ex-vivo incubation with chronic high glucose, and in an in vivo partial pancreatectomy
model of chronic hyperglycemia. Translational downregulation decreased cellular abundance of these proteins.
Subsequent analysis of actively translating ribosomes and pathways that regulate mRNA quality during
translation showed that sustained high glucose changes the protein composition of translating ribosomes and
suppresses nonsense mediated RNA decay (NMD). Altered ribosome composition and activity of RNA decay
pathways could result in changes in the abundance and fidelity of the proteins produced. I hypothesize that
hyperglycemia-induced remodeling of ribosomes and suppression of NMD alter expression of key β-cell genes
and increase neo-antigen production. In this proposal I will investigate the extent to which sustained high
glucose-remodeled ribosomes contribute to dysregulation of mRNA translation in β-cells and determine the
impact of reduced RNA surveillance and altered translation on neoantigen production and autoimmunity in T1D.
These studies could uncover novel therapeutic targets for prevention of progressive β-cell failure in T1D and for
optimizing functionality of ex vivo generated β-cells for cell replacement therapy."

Intra-coronary imaging is a powerful clinical tool for decision making, treatment planning, and assessment of
stent deployment. It is also a powerful research tool for plaque progression/regression, drug treatments, and
device interventions. There are clear advantages and disadvantages of common intravascular imaging methods.
Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) provides good resolution and allows one to measure lumen narrowing, wall
thickening, atheroma burden, and to a lesser extent stent deployment. Using spectral analysis of the RF signal
and machine learning, our group has developed software, which was later commercialized, to automatically
classify atherosclerotic tissues using IVUS images. Intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) has
better resolution than IVUS, enabling visualization and analysis of stent struts, thin caps of vulnerable plaques,
thrombosis, and plaque erosion. IVUS has better tissue penetration than IVOCT, enabling one to assess total
plaque burden. In addition, IVUS, unlike IVOCT, does not require one to flush the blood from the vessel prior to
imaging, a significant issue for patients, given the prevalence of kidney disease. These limitations suggest an
unmet need for a new intravascular imaging modality with attributes of both IVUS and IVOCT.
We will create a novel intravascular, high frequency, broadband, focused ultrasound system (H-IVUS), which
will address clinical needs identified for IVOCT and conventional IVUS. H-IVUS will have near-IVOCT resolution
to enable identification of critical small structures (e.g., thin caps and stent struts), while maintaining the ability
of ultrasound to penetrate tissue and evaluate soft plaque burden. It will have immediate clinical impact by ena-
bling clinicians to plan and optimize procedures that have already shown to benefit from intravascular imaging:
determine true vessel size, identify stent landing zones to choose correct stent lengths, identify plaque morphol-
ogies to guide debulking, detect edge dissection, determine stent malapposition, and detect thin caps. In addi-
tion, the high bandwidth of H-IVUS provides both fundamental and harmonic bands, which are expected to im-
prove tissue classification, as determined by us in carotid arteries. We will use broadband wavelet analysis of
RF, spatial structures in images, and machine learning to determine if wideband H-IVUS can provide improved
segmentation to improve recognition of the important clinical landmarks and provide superior automated plaque
classification over current VH IVUS®, which uses only narrow RF-fundamental-band stationary spectral analysis.
In addition, our manufacturing-friendly design should greatly reduce cost, thereby limiting this barrier to utiliza-
tion. Specifically, we will develop a catheter-based H-IVUS PCB using a focused polymeric ultrasonic transducer;
develop algorithms which utilize broadband RF and harmonic imaging to analyze tissue types w and rigorously
compare results to conventional IVUS and IVOCT. Our research will provide numerous innovations and enable
creation of a product to disrupt intracoronary imaging."
10972752,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic, progressive and conclusively fatal disease in which aberrant fibroblast
proliferation, contraction, and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition causes lung function decline. Studies by our
group and others, have identified a pivotal role for Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator
with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) transcription co-factors in activating fibroblasts to drive fibrosis in the lung. Although
these studies highlight the YAP/TAZ transcriptional program as a potential target for drug discovery, the
multitude of signaling inputs modulating this pathway, YAP and TAZ ubiquitous expression, and their involvement
in a wide array of cell functions, including stem cell maintenance, epithelial and endothelial homeostasis, render
them challenging therapeutic targets. Therefore, a treatment strategy targeting YAP/TAZ in fibroblasts selectively
over epithelial and endothelial cells would provide a novel avenue to treat IPF. While we have shown that
fibroblast-selective inhibition of nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ reverses fibrosis in IPF mouse models using
dopamine receptor D1 agonists, challenges in development of such compounds into effective therapies have led
us to perform a target-agnostic high-throughput screen, which identified several selective small molecule hit
compounds with validated anti-fibrotic activity in cell-based assays. The goal of this phased R61/R33 proposal
is to further characterize and optimize our novel fibroblast selective YAP/TAZ inhibitors into potent and selective
compounds with validated anti-fibrotic activity in vitro and ex vivo, and with favorable in vitro ADME/PK properties
(R61 phase). We will then optimize drug-like in vivo properties for 1-2 lead scaffolds, confirming their anti-fibrotic
effects caused by cell type-selective inhibition of YAP/TAZ in in vivo IPF mouse models (R33 phase). Together,
the proposed experiments will generate lead molecule(s), which can serve as the basis for an effective therapy
to treat IPF patients."
10972753,"Bedside 3D diagnostic imaging in ICU
ABSTRACT
 Imaging in intensive care unit (ICU) is an integral part of patient management. Bedside chest x-ray radiograph
(CXR) is the most often requested imaging examination for the commonly encountered pulmonary diseases in
the ICU and is also routinely used for the assessment of various catheters and tubes. In many ICU traditional
practice mandates a daily CXR for all ICU patients. It enables examination of the critically ill patients at the point-
of-care. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, physicians also use bedside CXR for follow-up of patients with
COVID pneumonia. The global market for mobile digital radiography was estimated to be over USD 2 billion in
2017, growing at an annual rate of 7%.
 However, as a 2D imaging modality the diagnostic accuracy of CXR is limited by structural/anatomical
overlaps. Superposition of devices, tubes and catheters further reduce the diagnostic quality. Interpretation of
CXR is challenging not only for intensive care physicians but also for radiologist. Computed tomography (CT) is
the current gold standard for diagnosis of cardiopulmonary diseases. However, CT uses a significantly higher
radiation exposure to the patients and the staff, and has a higher cost compared to CXR. With the exception of
a few special purpose systems, CT is in bulky and heavy and is not mobile.
 We propose to address this unmet clinical need of better diagnosis at the ICU by developing a mobile digital
tomosynthesis scanner to provide 3D imaging capability at the patient bedside. Digital tomosynthesis (DTS)
overcomes the problem of anatomical overlap by collecting multiple low-dose x-ray images from different angles.
It improves the visualization and diagnosis compared to CXR and uses a significantly lower dose and has a
lower cost compared to CT. It is now widely used clinically for detection of breast cancer, lung disease and
orthopedic imaging. The use of DTS is expected to improve the decision process in the ICU, but due to limitations
of the current technologies, no portable DTS has been developed. The proposed device is enabled by multiple
innovations including a novel carbon nanotube (CNT) x-ray source array technology invented by our team. We
have developed a proof-of-concept DTS and demonstrated its utility in patient imaging studies. The goal of this
project is to develop a mobile DTS device specifically for ICU.
 The technology is protected by a strong patent portfolio. New IP’s will be developed during this project to
strengthen the protection. The device is expected to require the Pre-market Notification (510(K)) approval from
the FDA. The Specific Aims of this project are: (1) Designing a mobile DTS for bedside 3D imaging (R61 Phase);
(2) Validating the system performance by image simulation and experiment (R61 Phase); and (3) Prototype
construction and validation (R33 Phase)."

Aging is a major risk factor for many chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and
neurodegenerative diseases, as well as for geriatric syndromes including frailty and sarcopenia. Therapeutics
that delay and/or slow the progression of aging, and thereby increase healthspan and longevity, have
remained elusive. Over the past several decades, genetic studies in model organisms and humans have
identified and validated a number of longevity-associated genes. A notable subset of these genes function in
the somatotropic axis that signals nutrient status and thereby regulates growth and metabolism. Together,
these findings strongly suggest that modest changes in the expression levels and/or activities of these genes
can have significant impact on healthspan and lifespan. Despite this strong genetic basis, how to
pharmacologically modulate levels of these genes in vivo has been a major challenge. Fortunately, antisense
oligonucleotides (ASOs) are emerging as a promising therapeutic modality, and they enable highly specific
modulation of target protein levels in vivo. Leveraging recent advances in ASO technology, we are now well
poised to target longevity-associated genes in vivo. In this project, we will: 1) design and test ASOs to
modulate the levels of four longevity-associated genes, and 2) test if the ASOs can extend lifespan and
improve healthspan using a mouse model of accelerated aging. Completion of these studies will provide
important insights into the utility of ASO-based therapeutic approaches for modulating levels of longevity-
associated genes to improve healthspan and increase longevity."
10953204,"Pertussis or whooping cough, despite widespread vaccination, remains a major human health
problem. Pertussis is highly infectious and is most dangerous for newborns, where 1/3 of
infected infants under one year old are hospitalized and one in a hundred of hospitalized babies
die. In the last decades, we have seen a resurgence in pertussis cases, which is believed to
stem from decreased efficacy of the vaccine. The current vaccine is composed of cellular
components of the causative agent of pertussis, Bordetella pertussis; a major component is the
protein Filamentous hemagglutinin protein (FHA). FHA is a virulence factor in Bordetella and is
essential for adherence and colonization in human hosts.
 FHA is the mature form of FhaB, following the loss of a signal peptide and FhaB’s C-
terminal region whereby it was proposed that this C-terminal region had no function. Notably,
FhaB has striking similarities to CdiA, the toxin carrying component of contact dependent growth
inhibition (CDI), whereby the C-terminal toxin domain of which is translocated into target
bacterial cells upon contact. Our recent work has shown that extreme C-terminal of FhaB
(FhaB-CT) is delivered into human cells, where it acts as a microtuble (MT) binding protein.
Thus, FhaB-CT likely has a role in Bordetella virulence. While FhaB is translocated into
eukaryotic cells and CdiA is translocated into bacterial cells; these similarities lead us to
hypothesize that FhaB is part of an uncharacterized anti-eukaryotic CDI system.
 This proposal aims to characterize the interaction of FhaB-CT with MTs and identify
other Gram-negative bacterial FhaB-CT domains with anti-eukaryotic activities. First, we will
determine the structure of the complex of FhaB-CT with MT using cryo-EM. Secondly, we will
identify other anti-eukaryotic FhaB-CT domains through in silico analysis. We will test these
domains for eukaryotic entry and toxin/adhesion activity.
 The results of this study will (1) lay the groundwork to further explore Bordetella virulence
and the activity of B. pertussis FhaB-CT, and (2) identify other FhaB-CT proteins that target
eukaryotic cells and characterize their activity. Not only could these results aid the development
of a new pertussis vaccine, but with an improved understanding of the interaction between FhaB-
CT and MTs we may also offer a new target for pertussis therapeutic development. Lastly, with
the discovery of FhaB-CT activity and a novel anti-eukaryotic CDI system, we have found a new
branch of CDI systems with direct correlation to human health that require investigation."
10953041,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 42% of new cancer cases in the U.S. are viewed as potentially avoidable, including 15% caused
by excess body weight and physical inactivity. However, most U.S. adults are physically inactive. Physical activity
intervention research has focused primarily on modifying cognitions about what a rationally-thinking person
“should” do to improve their health, resulting in modest effects on long-term behavior change. A factor that has
been largely overlooked in intervention research is that while engaging in physical activity may be pleasant for
some, it can be an extremely unpleasant experience for others. How someone feels during behavior can trigger
associative processes including implicit attitudes (e.g., favorable/unfavorable) towards the target behavior that
operate quickly and involuntarily outside of cognitive control. A recent meta-analysis showed a significant positive
association between positive implicit attitudes towards physical activity and physical activity engagement. Our
data show implicit attitudes towards physical activity differ from day to day and across situations. A variety of
experimental strategies such as guided imagery and visualization have shown promise in changing implicit
attitudes towards physical activity. However, rarely have these intervention strategies been delivered in real-
world settings on a regular basis to address variations in implicit attitudes. We will examine whether implicit
attitudes towards physical activity can be experimentally manipulated by “affect-based” intervention strategies
delivered daily through interactive mobile technology and mediate intervention effects on physical activity
behavior. The proposed study will add innovative real-time measures of implicit attitudes during daily life among
adults (18+ years) at elevated cancer risk due to inactivity and overweight/obesity participating in an ongoing
trial (N=120). An “affect” condition provides daily goals related to enjoyment and feeling good during physical
activity. In contrast, an “intensity” comparison condition provides daily heart rate goals. Two daily enhancements
to the affect-based condition are evaluated: (1) tailored activity type and context recommendations to satisfy
personally important psychological needs (TYPE/CONTEXT) and (2) savoring practices to increase the saliency
of positive emotions during physical activity (SAVOR). On each day that they plan to engage in physical activity,
implicit attitudes will be assessed by a morning mobile Implicit Associations Test (IAT) on their smartphone
capturing reaction times to categorize physical activity and sedentary words as good or bad. Physical activity
outcomes are measured using accelerometry. Specific aims are (1) determine whether implicit attitudes mediate
effects of treatments on physical activity and (2) explore cross-situation moderating effects such as situational
constraints (e.g., incidental stress, pain, fatigue). This study will elucidate how, why, and when intervention
strategies can influence implicit attitudes and lead to successful physical activity change. Insights about effects
on the mediators can be back-translated into refinements in the treatment strategies themselves, leading to more
effective and sustainable interventions."

Suicide is a major public health problem in the U.S., ranking as the second leading cause of death among
teens, with a rate of 7.1 per 100,000 population in this age group. Previous studies have revealed seasonal
trends and day-of-the-week effects in adolescent suicidal behavior, such as higher incidence in spring, on
Sundays, and on Mondays, and lower occurrences in summer, aligning with the school calendar. A significant
gap in understanding suicidal behavior exists among adolescents experiencing homelessness (AEH), who
show higher rates and distinct seasonal patterns and day-of-the-week effects compared to their domiciled
counterparts. Our previous research showed that AEH face increased risk when away from school, evidenced
by an attenuated summer decline in suicide attempts and peak suicide deaths in summer and the beginning of
the weekend (i.e., Fridays and Saturdays). The pandemic brought new challenges, such as economic
instability, limited access to essential services, and increased social isolation, which may have
disproportionately affected the vulnerable population of AEH. We hypothesized that the pandemic has
exacerbated existing disparities between AEH and their domiciled counterparts. Additionally, recent studies
reported decreased rates in suicidal behavior among adolescents in spring 2020, coinciding with nationwide
implementation of school closures as a pandemic control measure. However, no research has focused on AEH
during this time. Expanding on our prior study that showed a higher risk for AEH when they are away from
school, we hypothesize that suicidal behavior increased among AEH in spring 2020. To test these innovative
hypotheses, we will analyze three linked datasets: 1] Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) data;
2] hospital discharge records; and 3] death records from five jurisdictions, which collectively represent 32.5% of
AEH in the U.S. and 10.8% of the U.S. adolescent population. Adolescents aged 13 to 17 will be analyzed due
to distinct suicidal behavior mechanisms within this age group compared to younger children and older
adolescents. For example, adolescents younger than 18 are subject to distinct stressors related to school
enrollment, whereas some individuals above 18 are not in school. The circumstances surrounding
homelessness may differ as well, with those below 18 often accompanied by parents and those above 18 often
living independently. Aim 1 will investigate differences in annual rates of suicidal behavior among AEH and
domiciled adolescents between 2016 and 2022 to determine whether the pandemic has exacerbated existing
disparities between the two groups. Aim 2 will assess monthly trends in suicidal behavior before, during, and
after the pandemic to determine whether suicidal behavior increased among AEH in spring 2020. Investigating
trends in suicidal behavior among AEH during the pandemic will inform whether suicide prevention measures
tailored to AEH are needed, especially before and during school breaks. The findings will also enhance
preparedness for potential school closures due to future pandemics."

Astrocytes are one of the major glial subtypes of the central nervous system (CNS), evolutionarily conserved
from Drosophila to humans with regard to their morphology, molecular composition, and function. Although
their morphological complexity is thought to be essential for astrocytes to perform their myriad roles in the CNS
by physically contacting and interacting with diverse neural structures, including synapses and the vasculature,
we only know of a handful of pathways that critically regulate astrocyte morphology. From an unbiased,
forward genetic screen in Drosophila, we surprisingly identified dSarm and dWnk/Fray, both of which have
been implicated in axon degeneration, as potential new regulators of astrocyte morphology. Preliminary
findings in Drosophila show that dSarm/Sarm1 and dWnk/WNK work synergistically to regulate not only axon
degeneration but also astrocyte morphology. Here, we propose to leverage the larval zebrafish system to ask
whether the role of Sarm1 and WNK in regulating astrocyte development is evolutionarily conserved. In the
axon degeneration pathway, NAD+ depletion is thought to be upstream of dSarm/Sarm1 and dWnk/WNK
activation, and Axundead (Axed) to be downstream. Whereas the importance of NAD+ depletion upstream of
dSarm/Sarm1 and dWnk/WNK has been shown across species, the functional ortholog of Axed is unknown in
vertebrates. We therefore propose to determine if and how these known axon degeneration pathways up- and
downstream of dSarm/Sarm1 and dWnk/WNK also function in vertebrate astrocytes. By harnessing the
pharmacological and genetic toolkits available in larval zebrafish, we will interrogate the involvement of the
NAD+ biosynthetic pathway in controlling process dynamics and morphology of astrocytes in vivo. We will
additionally perform a targeted reverse genetic screen to identify the functional vertebrate ortholog of Axed in
mediating Sarm1/WNK effects on astrocyte morphology. Together, this study will define new roles for key
molecules in axon degeneration in the regulation of astrocyte morphogenesis and further our understanding of
the Sarm1 signaling pathway in vivo."

Every year, 50,000 preterm infants are diagnosed with chronic lung disease (CLD). CLD is associated with
reduced lung function and morbidity that persists into adulthood, with glaring racial disparities. Black preterm
infants with CLD have higher rates of respiratory symptoms, medication use, emergency department visits, and
readmissions in the first year of life, although White preterm infants are more likely to be diagnosed with CLD
at birth. Few studies with Black preterm infants have focused on this critical period of the lifecourse after
hospital discharge. Patient and family engagement interventions can promote equity and improve health
outcomes by centering on patients' lived experiences. This may be especially true for Black preterm infants
with CLD whose engagement in care is impacted by complex medical needs, social determinants, and parental
mental health and wellbeing. Guided by an inclusive and multidisciplinary advisory board co-led by Black
parents, this proposal will provide novel insights into the hospital to home transition for Black preterm infants
with CLD. It will also address a critical need for health equity interventions in pediatrics. Aim 1 is to
characterize profiles of preterm infants with CLD by medical needs and social determinants and identify
profiles associated with the highest risk of respiratory morbidity. Aim 2 is to describe the lived experience of
parents of Black preterm infants with CLD in the first year of life. Aim 3 is to develop and evaluate the feasibility
and acceptability of a pediatric-adapted collaborative goal setting (P-CGS) tool piloted with parents of Black
preterm infants with CLD during a primary care visit and explore preliminary child and parent outcomes. This
K23 proposal addresses two critically important NHLBI priority areas: 1) pediatric lung health disparities, and 2)
the transition from hospital to home for preterm infants with CLD. It will also provide the applicant, Dr. Brandon
Smith, MD, MPH, the opportunity to become an independent clinician investigator with expertise in parent
engagement interventions in primary care to advance health equity. The proposed research and career
development plan will support Dr. Smith's four training objectives: 1) acquire skills in advanced statistical
methods; 2) gain expertise in designing and leading qualitative research; 3) attain skills in the development and
testing of interventions in pediatric primary care; and 4) obtain in-depth understanding of patient engagement
theory and practice to promote health equity with emphasis on local expertise. Dr. Smith will take advantage of
a committed and multidisciplinary mentorship team and strong training environment at the Johns Hopkins
Medical Institutions to launch his independent career. The results of this study will provide preliminary data for
a future R01 application to test the efficacy of the P-CGS tool in reducing lung health disparities for Black
preterm infants with CLD using a randomized, clinical trial."
10952126,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Outpatient physical therapy use is common among older adults who have Alzheimer’s Disease and Related
Dementia (ADRD). Unfortunately, physical therapist approaches in this setting do not effectively address the
needs of this growing population that has a substantially elevated risk for disability, morbidity, and mortality.
Physical therapists in the outpatient setting are in significant need of tools to identify and manage ADRD. The
purpose of my National Institute on Aging K76 Career Development Award is to develop a toolbox that
improves physical therapy services delivery for older adults with ADRD. In the proposed award, I will leverage
Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) data in the Health and Retirement Study to identify
domains of cognitive function that should be targeted with the rehabilitation toolbox (AIM1) and use qualitative
methods to define barriers and facilitators to physical therapy service delivery for older adults with ADRD
(AIM2). I will then use an iterative human-centered design approach to develop the refined rehabilitation
toolbox for working with older adults who have ADRD (AIM3). Using a human-centered design with multiple
stakeholder groups and the substantial formative knowledge gained from AIM1 and AIM2 will facilitate rapid
toolbox development while optimizing acceptability, feasibility, and potential for future outpatient rehabilitation
practice implementation. The study aims are tightly aligned with my training objectives, which are to: 1) apply
advanced epidemiology and health services research skills in aging populations; 2) develop effective
rehabilitation-focused interventions for older adults with ADRD; 3) become an expert in implementation science
and pragmatic clinical trial design; and 4) enhance skills in dissemination, grant writing, and leadership.
Together, my study aims and career objectives will accelerate my progress toward becoming a leader whose
work improves the health, disability, and quality of life of older adults with ADRD. The proposed K76 career
development award will set the foundation for an NIH R01 that will test the effectiveness of the refined toolbox
in rehabilitation service delivery for older adults with ADRD."

synaptic plasticity has been demonstrated, there is no data for the contribution of astrocyte mitochondria
bioenergetics to opiate-induced plasticity. We propose to investigate the role for astrocyte mitochondria
oxidative phosphorylation in heroin-induced plasticity.
 Specific Aim1 will identify the role for astrocyte mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation in mediating
heroin-induced plasticity. We hypothesize that knockdown of the Cox10 gene in NAc astrocytes will
significantly increase cue- and/or drug-induced heroin seeking behavior in mice.
 Specific Aim 2 will determine the changes in oxidative phosphorylation, glycolytic activity and other
relevant energy metabolism pathways in NAc astrocytes in wild-type mice during abstinence following heroin
self-administration. We hypothesize that long-term abstinence following heroine intake leads to up-regulation
of astrocyte energy metabolism pathways to result in heroin-induced plasticity.
 This innovative proposal will identify new astrocyte-specific metabolic pathways essential to the
neurobiology underlying opioid addiction and relapse."
10952837,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There exist few preventive or therapeutic modalities for vulnerable hosts against bacterial diarrheal illness.
Further, the limited effectiveness of anti-infectives is being compromised by the antimicrobial resistant crisis. In
response to this situation, physicians and scientists have investigated the role of probiotics. Despite promising
preliminary data showing benefit in weakened immune hosts and against drug-resistant isolates, probiotic clinical
trials have demonstrated inconsistent therapeutic and safety profiles. For these reasons, identifying the
molecular mechanisms by which probiotics provide benefit is needed to develop new therapeutics. Notably, the
Hang laboratory has discovered specific Enterococcus peptidoglycan hydrolases can improve intestinal barrier
function and confer resistance against enteric infections in mouse models. Furthermore, these peptidoglycan
hydrolases genetically engineered into Lactobacillus species were able to recapitulate protective effects. Given
the unclear efficacy of probiotics in humans, we aim to develop orally available recombinant peptidoglycan
hydrolases therapeutics that will promote intestinal barrier function to protect against enteric pathogens. We
therefore propose to evaluate the activity of recombinant Enterococcus peptidoglycan hydrolase hydrogel
formulations in mouse models of enteric infection (Aim 1) as well as explore peptidoglycan remodeling enzymes
from other microbiota species/strains (Aim 2). The work proposed herein should afford new preventive and
treatment modalities for vulnerable hosts against enteric infections."
10952839,"Ultrasound neuromodulation promises to revolutionize treatment for neurological and mental disorders by providing pre-
cise, non-invasive treatment of the neural circuits involved in disease. Ultrasound’s strength lies in its capacity to focus
energy through the intact skull to grain of rice size regions deep in the brain. At these target regions, the ultrasound
interacts with the neural tissue resulting in modulation of the neural activity. Transcranial ultrasound neuromodula-
tion treatments are emerging in both pre-clinical and clinical studies as a promising approach to treat diseases from
depression to Alzheimer’s and epilepsy.
The effect of ultrasound on the target tissue depends on the sonication parameters—the amplitude, duration, duty cy-
cle, and pulse repetition frequency of the ultrasound pulse. Studies show that, depending on the selected parameters,
ultrasound can both excite and inhibit the target tissue. However, this flexibility is not yet utilized clinically because
the relationship between the acoustic parameters and the neural response remains elusive. This study will develop
a nonhuman primate (NHP) model capable of measuring real-time changes in neural activity after ultrasound neuro-
modulation. Thus, the study aims to deliver clinic-ready protocols capable of optimally exciting or inhibiting the target
region.
To achieve this goal we will combine two existing technologies. Remus is a remote ultrasound system capable of flexibly
delivering arbitrary ultrasound pulses to deep brain regions in an awake, behaving NHP. In.Tra is a cranial implant that
is transparent to ultrasound and thus enables functional ultrasound imaging. Combined, the two technologies enable
real-time monitoring of the awake brain’s response to ultrasound neuromodulation.
Our two aims will validate this approach by measuring the response of the awake visual system to ultrasound neuro-
modulation of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). In Aim 1 we will measure the neural response of the targeted LGN
and the ipsilateral primary visual cortex. In Aim 2 we will measure changes in the correlation coefficient (a marker of
functional connectivity) between the same two regions. Both experiments will include systematic variation of the am-
plitude, duration, duty cycle, and pulse repetition frequency of the neuromodulatory sonication, including parameters
expected to excite and inhibit the targeted anatomy. Thus, validation of our platform will produce clinic-ready protocols
to suppress or excite neural activity in the targeted circuit."
10952630,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating degenerative brain disorder and the most prevalent form of
dementia, affecting millions worldwide. Given its significant impact on public health, it is crucial to accelerate the
development of treatments that would prevent, delay, or reverse the course of the disease and improve early
diagnosis. In neurons, Tau protein is primarily known for its canonical role in assembling and stabilizing
microtubules. Moreover, native Tau binds to both DNA and RNA molecules, suggesting a role in RNA
transcription, post-transcriptional processing and translation. However, in the AD brain, Tau protein undergoes
misfolding and subsequently forms pathological oligomers. In this context, I propose that misfolded Tau is unable
to bind RNA, hampering its function on RNA post-transcriptional processing and altering gene expression.
One of the key mechanisms for controlling gene expression in eukaryotic cells is Alternative Poly-
Adenylation (APA). APA can affect the length, stability, translation, localization, and function of mRNAs. In our
inducible Tau cell model, wild-type or native (wt) Tau modulates the expression of several APA mRNAs that
encode RNA-Binding Proteins (RBPs). Several of these identified RBPs have been observed with altered
function and aggregation in AD and Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). These findings underscore the
substantial involvement of APA in neuronal degeneration, highlighting its paramount significance in
the pathogenesis of AD and AD related disorders (AD/ADRD). However, the mechanism underlying how
Tau modulates APA is unknown. We propose that in AD, Tau oligomerization interferes with APA and
hampers short and long 3'-UTR mRNA isoforms of RBPs critical to RNA processing.
The primary outcome of this study is to comprehensively profile APA transcripts and gene expression in wild
type and mutant Tau-expressing neurons. We seek to build upon our published data, investigating the
effects of pathological Tau (oligomeric and mutant forms) on APA, which is yet to be determined. We will test
our hypothesis via two specific aims. In Aim 1, our objective is to identify and compare mRNA isoform libraries
from mouse primary hippocampal neurons expressing human wt-Tau (htau) and pathogenic mutant
Tau (rTg5410, MAPT-P301L). We are excited to harness the groundbreaking Poly(A)-ClickSeq (PAC-
Seq) technology, an innovative approach that will unlock comprehensive profiles of APA transcripts and
gene expression in wt and mutant Tau-expressing neurons. In Aim 2, we propose to identify APA mRNA
isoforms in htau and rTg4510 before and after the manifestation of Tau pathology. Additionally, we will use
biochemical and cellular assays to pinpoint changes in Tau oligomer-modulated mRNA isoform levels and
expression. Our approach delves deeper into the impact of APA, surpassing the limited evaluation of gene
expression offered by previous RNA-Seq methods. By connecting APA with Tau pathology, our study seeks
to advance the field by identifying the mRNA isoforms altered by pathological Tau in AD/ADRD."

Functional brain network characteristics reflect both genetic and environmental influences on brain
development during fetal and postnatal periods. Alterations in network characteristics signal the presence of
pathogenic factors and their potential mechanisms of action, which is crucial for the identification of processes
that enhance risk for future onset of behavioral symptoms. Considering that autism features are distributed in
the general population and are enriched in children with family members diagnosed with autism, the present
study examines links between neonatal connectome and later social outcomes in a large sample of infants with
and without familial history of autism (FHA). The outcomes of interest are (a) social attention which represents
one of the most robust biomarkers reported in infants, toddlers, and school-aged children with autism, and (b)
social engagement skills which represent a core feature associated with autism in toddlers. Towards these
aims, we propose to examine prospective associations between iFC and later social phenotypic outcomes in a
prospective sample of infants with (N=140) and without (N=60) FHA. By combining the two groups and
adopting a dimensional approach to outcome measures, we aim to capture both the clinical and the subclinical
variation in symptoms, which is critical for understanding the link between altered brain development and
psychopathology. Brain imaging data will be collected at 42-44 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA); selective
social attention measures will be collected at 6 and 18 months, and social engagement measure will be
collected at 18 months. Social attention will be quantified using the Selective Social Attention (SSA) 2.0 eye-
tracking task developed and validated in our lab. A composite social engagement score will be computed
based on direct observation and parent report using standardized assessment tools: ADOS-2 and ADI-R. Aims
1 and 2 will focus on examining prospective links between inter- and intra-network iFC of the SN, DMN, FPN,
and amygdala networks and later social attentional and social engagement outcomes. To complement the
hypotheses-driven Aims, in Aim 3 we will conduct a data-driven whole brain analysis. This study will identify
the characteristics of the neonatal connectome linked prospectively with behavioral dimensions known to be
affected in autism, creating potential for improving identification of early brain-based risk factors and
implementation of early interventions to support social attention and engagement in infancy and early
childhood."

Our proposed project will build upon previous research which has shown an association between oral health
and systemic health, including the relationship between heart disease and periodontitis. We will benefit from
recent methodological advances in computational genomics and be the first study to provide causal evidence
about the postulated relationship between poor oral health and heart disease using nationally-representative,
longitudinal data. Specifically, we will construct polygenic scores using a GWAS-by-subtraction genomic
structural equation model that are suitable for use in instrumental variables estimation. To accomplish our
Aims, we will use longitudinal files containing 11 years of data (2006-2016) from the Health and Retirement
Study (HRS). This longitudinal database will provide over 22,000 older Americans producing a sufficiently large
sample size to overcome prior analytical obstacles.
Aim 1. Determine the strength of genetic risk factors for poor oral health. The working hypothesis is that
individual genetic composition is a strong predictor of poor oral health.
Aim 2. Determine the causal effect of poor oral health on the probability of heart disease (HD). The
working hypothesis is that variation in oral health due to individual genetic composition can be used to identify
the causal effect of poor oral health on HD."
10952886,"Project Summary
Bacterial pathogens use “effector” proteins as part of their virulence strategies to subvert host functions
and promote bacterial intracellular survival, proliferation and persistence. These effectors operate
individually or collectively to modulate cellular processes, usually in a functionally integrated manner.
Bacterial effectors may have antagonistic or convergent activities on cellular pathways or regulate each
other’s activities (as “meta-effectors”). How multiple effector activities are coordinated spatially and
temporally in host cells remains largely unknown. In our efforts to characterize mechanisms of intracellular
proliferation of the intracellular bacterium Brucella abortus, we have uncovered a physical interaction
between three Type IV secretion effectors - BspF, BspH and BspI - suggesting that they form a multi-
effector complex when delivered into host cells. BspF is a putative acetyltransferase that localizes to the
recycling endosome and interacts with the host protein ACAP1, a GTPase activating protein (GAP) of the
endocytic GTPase Arf6, thereby inhibiting Arf6 activity and retrograde vesicular transport to promote
Brucella intracellular growth. BspH and BspI remain poorly characterized but contain structural Armadillo
(ARM) repeats and a GAP domain, respectively, suggesting protein-protein interactions for BspH and host
GTPase modulation capabilities for BspI. Consistently, we found that BspI directly interacts with the host
GTPases Rac1 and Rab5. Moreover, we found that BspF, BspH and BspI interact in a complex associated
with early endosomal structures. We will test the hypothesis that these effector proteins intrinsically form
a multi-effector platform that coordinates host GTPase-modulating effector activities on endosomal
transport to promote bacterial intracellular growth. Aim 1 will determine key aspects of the structure and
assembly of the BspF:H:I complex, using computational, biochemical and structural biology approaches.
Aim 2 will i) determine the function of BspI and of the BspF;H:I complex in Brucella’s intracellular cycle and
ii) define functional interactions between BspF, BspH and BspI. The proposed research will address
seminal questions towards establishing a new paradigm of integration of bacterial effector functions with
broad impact to the field of bacterial pathogenesis."
10953354,"Development of potent and safe CRISPR tools for in vivo gene editing using directed evolution
Abstract
 Genome editing, or the ability to precisely manipulate DNA, is an emerging technology that has the
potential to be a permanent cure for deadly and debilitating genetic diseases. The development of CRISPR-
Cas9 as a genome editing tool has catapulted this field from primary research to clinical trials within the past
decade. CRISPR has already been successfully used to treat multiple diseases in human clinical trials, including
hereditary blindness, neurodegeneration, blood disorders, and cancer. As these treatments grow in complexity
and enter more patients, we increasingly need advanced CRISPR-Cas9 tools that enable potent gene correction
while improving safety from aberrant toxic and immunogenic effects.
 Cas9 is favored for many genome editing approaches due to the ease of reprogramming; the CRISPR
single guide RNA (sgRNA) dictates target site through base pairing to a user-defined sequence. However,
eukaryotic cells display robust cellular and immunogenic responses towards RNAs, leading to sgRNA instability
and toxicity. Chemical RNA modification overcomes this issue by protecting the oligonucleotide from cellular
RNA-recognizing machinery, leading to improved stability, distribution, cellular uptake, and safety. Importantly,
full chemical modification (modification at every residue) has been essential for the therapeutic success of
established RNA therapeutics, like silencing RNA (siRNA). Despite the promises of full chemical modification,
fully modified sgRNA remain poorly active for Cas9 genome editing, likely due to the complex interactions
between the Cas9 and sgRNA being incompatible with chemical modification.
 This proposal describes an approach to engineer Cas9 proteins towards compatibility with fully
chemically modified sgRNA. These Cas9:sgRNA pairs would enable highly efficient, easy to deliver, and immune
evasive genome editing, supporting genome editing applications including multiplexed targets, transient editing,
redosing, and vector inactivation."
10948230,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes severe
personality and behavior changes. A hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene is
FTD's most common genetic cause. I aim to elucidate the mechanisms of circuit dysfunction in
C9orf72-FTD, focusing on understanding the relationship between cortical hyperactivity, the
progression of C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat pathology, and behavior. Understanding these
aspects is crucial for developing effective and timely treatments for FTD.
The first aim of this research is to monitor the progression of neuronal activity during critical age
in a robust animal model of FTD and evaluate its relationship to neuronal loss. In the second
aim, I will determine whether neuronal hyperactivity can causally drive the progression of FTD
pathology and behavioral deficits. I will then test the effect of restoring neuronal activity by
modulating the balance between excitation and inhibition on pathology and behavioral deficits in
a C9orf72-FTD model. I will capitalize on my expertise in state-of-the-art technology, such as
multiphoton microscopy, optogenetics, and chemogenetics while acquiring knowledge and skills
in FTD research, FTD animal models, and electrophysiology.
A team of renowned experts in the field will provide mentorship to guide me through specialized
training and ensure the establishment of an independent research career in the FTD field. The
career development plan includes attending laboratory meetings and departmental discussions,
national conferences, crafting research grant proposals, and preparing manuscripts. The
training will take place at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), a prominent teaching hospital
affiliated with Harvard Medical School (HMS). MGH is renowned for its supportive research
environment, advanced resources, and collaborative atmosphere conducive to learning and
research in neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, MGH and HMS will facilitate my
professional development by granting me access to various courses and workshops to enhance
my presentation, leadership, and management skills.
In summary, this award will prepare me to lead a research lab, ensuring successful

10948231,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) epidemics parallel a rise in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
(ASCVD), and heart failure (HF). Elevated serum erythritol concentrations have been linked to increased
ASCVD with erythritol ingestion as an artificial sweetener implicated. Erythritol has been shown to be
endogenously produced through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and further metabolized to
erythronate. Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study analysis of samples from prior to FDA approval
of erythritol as an artificial sweetener found erythritol to be associated with coronary heart disease,
independent of diabetes and obesity, suggesting a role for endogenous production. It is unknown whether
increased erythritol and erythronate are markers of pathophysiological changes in metabolic pathways or
causal markers of ASCVD that are impacted by genetic variability. Absolute erythritol and erythronate
concentrations in people with and without T2D and/or obesity also need to be established. We hypothesize that
(1) erythritol, erythronate, and other PPP enzymes and metabolites have strong associations with
macrovascular and microvascular disease and HF; (2) erythritol and erythronate concentrations are
impacted by genetic variability; and (3) persons with T2D and obesity have higher erythritol and
erythronate concentrations in the fasting state, which are further exaggerated in response to
exogenous glucose and erythritol. Aim 1 examines the association of erythritol, erythronate and other PPP
intermediates to incident micro- and macrovascular disease and HF outcomes in multiethnic observational
studies. Aim 2 determines whether T2D and/or obesity status increase production of erythritol and erythronate
when fasting and/or in response to glucose infusion and oral erythritol. Understanding erythritol and
erythronate’s endogenous production, genetic variability, and association to ASCVD is key to understanding
clinical predictive utility. The effect of exogenous glucose and erythritol intake on erythritol and erythronate
concentration in people with and without T2D and/or obesity will shed light on the role of dietary intake in these
groups. Dr. Abushamat is a board-certified adult endocrinologist and tenure-track assistant professor at Baylor
College of Medicine. Her long-term goal is to become an independent NIH-funded physician-scientist in

by augmenting her past training as an MD/MPH via master’s level training in clinical investigation with the
addition of skills in multi-omic analysis, Mendelian Randomization, stable-isotope tracer studies and

10948539,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cigarette smoking and nicotine dependence account for more than 7 million deaths per year worldwide. A major
challenge for treatments targeting smoking cessation is relapse: Most people who attempt to quit return to
smoking within months. When individuals stop smoking, being in environments where they used to smoke, like
bars, coffee shops, or bus stops, can trigger cravings for nicotine and lead to a return to smoking. This is known
as context-induced relapse, where context refers to the physical space or social setting associated with drug
use. These associative memories between contexts and nicotine are thought to be formed and retrieved by the
hippocampus and dependent on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), specifically β2 containing-nAChRs
(β2*-nAChRs). However, the specific neuronal mechanisms underlying these nicotine-context associations in
the hippocampus and their modulation by β2*-nAChRs are not yet fully understood. Studying the involvement of
the hippocampus in learning these associations presents challenges, as it requires tracking the activity of the
same neurons over extended periods of time (days to weeks). To address this, I propose to use large-scale
imaging techniques that allow for long-term recording of neural activity in awake and behaving mice, combined
with computational tools to uncover the underlying neural dynamics. My central hypotheses are 1) that the
formation of nicotine-context memories in the hippocampus requires the binding of nicotine to β2*-nAChRs 2)
this binding, also enables hippocampal neurons to form stable memory representations of the nicotine-context
with repeated learning and 3) that stable memory traces are re-activated during context re-exposure leading to
relapse. To test these hypotheses, I will combine a novel behavior paradigm to assess context-induced relapse
behavior using virtual-reality in mice with two-photon imaging of large populations of hippocampal neurons. With
this technique, I will track activity of the same neurons during nicotine-context learning and memory retrieval.
Further, I will integrate this activity imaging with genetic techniques and pharmacological manipulations to
causally examine the role of β2*-nAChRs. Through this comprehensive approach, my research aims to provide
a detailed understanding of how nicotine-driven memory representations in the hippocampus contribute to
context-induced relapse, at a spatial and temporal scale that has not been achieved before. This mechanistic
understanding of neural computations in the hippocampus will potentially help identify novel therapeutics and
relapse-prevention strategies. To achieve these goals, I will receive mentorship and support from a group of
experts in various fields, including hippocampal memory processes (Dr. Mark Sheffield), nicotinic receptor
function (Dr. Daniel McGehee), task design and animal behavior (Dr. Rick Bevins), genetic techniques (Dr. Xiaoxi
Zhuang) and computational analysis of large-scale neural recordings (Dr. Jason MacLean). This mentored
training will facilitate my transition to become an independently funded investigator, where I will continue to study

10952464,"Project Summary
Among the vital signs of human health, respiratory parameters are key indicators of the physiological status of the
human body. Particularly important to clinicians is the ability to quantify the real-time dynamics and physio-
logical distribution of blood gas measurements of oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2), which provide them
with an understanding of the mechanisms associated with both pathological and normal physiological conditions.
The accurate diagnosis of respiratory diseases requires a measure of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen
(PaO2) and the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), called blood gases. The determination of
blood gases requires an arterial blood sample, an invasive and painful process. This procedure, however, pro-
vides only a discrete measurement of respiratory efficacy during a rapidly changing situation. Transcutaneous
monitoring is a noninvasive method of continuously measuring the transcutaneous partial pressures of O2 and
CO2 (PtcO2 and PtcCO2) diffused through the skin, and any changes they undergo correlate closely with
changes in PaO2 and PaCO2. The contemporary methodology for measuring PtcO2 and PtcCO2 requires a
heated sensor and a costly non-portable, bulky, corded sensing unit. The goal of the proposed research is to
develop a computational modeling framework for a miniaturized, noninvasive, wireless, luminescence-
based carbon dioxide sensing wearable device with embedded computational models that can accurately
translate the PtcCO2 to PaO2, a vital clinical parameter.
 PIs’ groups recently pioneered a new technique that uses CO2-sensitive luminescence film to monitor PtcCO2.
It requires neither heating nor direct line-of-sight overcoming all the drawbacks of the electrochemical- and IR-
based techniques. Although very promising, PtcCO2’s usage is limited in clinical practice since the previous
studies show unreliable correlation between PaCO2 and PtcCO2 measurements. Our approach will differ from
current practice by predicting the effects of the factors such as temperature, sensor location, age, sex
in order to estimate PaCO2 more accurately. In this research effort, nanoscale bio-electronic components
are tightly integrated with computational models of biological processes for more accurate and personalized
interpretation of measurements in the noisy environment of the human body.
 In Specific Aim 1, we will develop computational models of carbon dioxide transport from capillaries through
skin tissue layers using finite element analysis and develop a physics-based estimation algorithm that can be
implemented in a wearable. In Specific Aim 2, we will develop the transcutaneous CO2 wearable with an embed-
ded lightweight estimation algorithm based on computational models developed in Specific Aim 1 to facilitate the
real-time operation of the device. In Specific Aim 3, we will conduct a human pilot study in a lab setting to validate
our proposed monitoring system against the gold standards. Progress on enabling the affordable and scalable
remote monitoring of respiration at home is transformative for medical and scientific research."
10952185,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There are hundreds of studies of Alzheimer’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias, and other
neurodegenerative diseases comparing post-mortem (PM) human brain tissues obtained from human brain
repositories. Current approaches that compare multiple, separately measured, -omic profiles studies introduce
variability from using multiple samples. Thus, a multi-omics approach that can utilize a single biospecimen is
needed. We have developed a penta-omic extraction method for frozen tissue and propose a proof-of-concept
study. This effort would create the first penta-omic database, utilizing normal PM human brain tissue from the
NIH NeuroBioBank. A new penta-omic simultaneous metabolomic, proteomic, lipidomic, DNA, RNA extraction
method called SiMPL-DREx will be applied to a single tissue sample which will minimize the heterogeneity
associated with testing multiple samples. SiMPL-DREx has added value because it more efficiently uses small
volume, highly requested brain tissue. PM tissue selection is generally based entirely on a single quality control
measure, RNA integrity number (RIN), obtained from a single tissue sample, usually the occipital pole (OP). Of
the four -omic macromolecules extracted with SiMPL-DREx, RNA is the most labile primarily due to the universal
distribution of RNase in the body. Tissue with RIN >7 is highly desirable for genomic and transcriptomic studies,
yet how the overall quality of the metabolome, proteome, and lipidome (MPL) varies as a function of RIN has
never been fully investigated. Tissues with RIN<7.0 are rejected for most -omic studies but may have sufficient
quality for MPL studies. The primary post-mortem factor affecting -omic quality is autolysis which is dependent
on body temperature. The time to be placed in cold storage is often not easily determined so RIN serves as a
surrogate. This study will assess the association of RIN and measures of -omic quality in OP from unaffected
donors with three RIN values (9-10, 6-7, 3-5) having an immediate death (agonal duration <1hr). The
overarching goal of this study is to validate the penta-omic extraction method and to identify markers of
tissue quality for different -omics outcomes that are independent of RIN. To this end, we will pursue two
specific aims. In aim 1, SiMPL-DREx will be validated against existing single-omic extraction methods. In aim
2A, we will examine association of RIN category with DNA integrity number (DIN), protein integrity number (PIN)
and pH to identify potential additional measures of tissue quality. In aim 2B a new measure, lipid integrity number
(LIN) based on lipase activity is defined and will be tested for independence from RIN. The metabolome is unique
by contributions from macro- and micro-molecular degradation, and therefore individual metabolites will be
examined for association with RIN as potential markers of quality. If successful, this study will establish a more
efficient method for multi-omic tissue extraction and identify additional measures of tissue quality for -omic
studies beyond RIN."

(aBL) emitting envelope (aBL-ENV), which emits aBL uniformly across the entire envelope surface, to combat
CIED infections. Our central hypothesis is that aBL-ENV is capable of preventing biofilm formation or
eradicating existing biofilms on CIEDs, ultimately reducing the risk of CIED infections. To test this hypothesis,
we propose two Specific Aims.
In Aim 1, we will conduct in vitro studies to assess the anti-biofilm efficacy of aBL-ENV. Staphylococcus
aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli (including ATTC
reference strains and recent clinical isolates), which are the common bacteria identified in CIED infections, will
be studied. Biofilms will be formed on aBL-ENVs in the growth medium. To prevent biofilm formation, aBL-
ENVs will be ""activated"" by aBL within 3 h after bacterial inoculation. To eradicate existing biofilms, aBL-ENVs
will be ""activated"" 24, 48, and 96 h after bacterial inoculation when biofilms of different stages have formed.
The efficacy found with aBL-ENVs will be compared with that of clinically used antibiotic-eluting envelopes.
In Aim 2, we will assess the anti-biofilm efficacy and safety of aBL-ENV in vivo using a rabbit model of CIED
pocket infections. The clinical isolates of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa that exhibit the highest biofilm-forming
capability (identified in Aim 1) will be used as the model pathogens. Immediately after CIED implantation,
animals will be delivered 1 mL of bacterial suspensions (5×103 CFU/mL for S. aureus and 2×104 CFU/mL for P.
aeruginosa) into the CIED pockets. To prevent biofilm formation, aBL-ENVs will be activated by aBL within 3 h
after bacterial challenge. To eradicate existing biofilms, the activation of aBL-ENVs will be delayed until 24-48
h after bacterial challenge to allow for mature biofilm formation. aBL treatment will be performed twice daily at
8-h intervals for seven days. The bacterial loads of aBL-ENVs and the pocket tissues will then be quantified.
To assess the safety of aBL-ENV, the pocket tissue damage will be evaluated using histology at varying time
points (1, 7, and 28 days after treatment). The potential inflammatory response triggered by aBL-ENV will be
analyzed by measuring the proinflammatory cytokine profile in the pocket tissue. Additionally, we will determine
whether there is a long-term carcinogenic effect associated with aBL-ENV following implantation.
The most important impact of this application resides in its potential to pioneer a new field of study on the
novel aBL-ENV to combat CIED infections. The successful completion of the Specific Aims detailed in this
application will provide initial preclinical evidence to assess the effectiveness and safety of aBL-ENV."

EicOsis is developing a first-in-class analgesic with efficacy against neuropathic pain that will
replace and dose spare opioids and thus prevent opioid use disorders (OUDs). The target of the
small molecule inhibitor EC5026 is the soluble epoxide hydrolase, a master regulatory enzyme
that modulates the activity of endogenous bioactive lipids. The development of EC5026 is
currently in progress and progressing to an IND filing and is poised to have a high impact in
treating chronic pain in humans. In this proposal we outline aims to reach the next steps in
clinical human clinical trials with EC5026 as well as additional preclinical studies to expand the
efficacy into models of chronic pain conditions presenting in humans which are most frequently
treated with opioids. Additionally, we propose detailed pharmacokinetic, metabolism and
distribution studies that will provide the required information for advanced clinical trials
examining efficacy in humans. We also propose to optimize a formulation to meet these needs.
All of these individual aims are structured to meet 2 year milestones (UG3) and continue to the
next planned steps in development (UH3) as these milestones are met. EicOsis is meeting
current development goals and EC5026 is well positioned to meet the urgent need of reducing
opioid use because even given the updated strategy to treating pain with multimodal
approaches, pharmaceuticals are the foundation of treating pain. EC5026 represents a first-in-
class analgesic that is not an opioid nor a NSAID but offers effective pain relief for chronic
neuropathic pain."

This exploratory grant seeks to evaluate linkages between social reward processing in autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) and systemic inflammation. The social motivation theory of autism posits that reduced
motivation to interact with people and decreased pleasure derived from social interactions may derail typical
social development and contribute to the emergence of social communication deficits in ASD. This framework
highlights the centrality of impaired brain reward circuitry functioning to the etiology of ASD and suggests that
when young children with ASD lack the motivation to participate in activities where social skills are typically
forged, the resulting impoverished social environment contributes to the emergence of social communication
impairments in the disorder. There is increasing evidence that inflammatory processes contribute to ASD risk
and pathogenesis, and that neuroinflammation, in turn, interferes with social reward processing. However, no
research to date has examined relations between immune function and neural responses to social rewards in
ASD. The objective of this proposal is to investigate relations between (i) neural responses to social rewards,
measured via electroencephalography (EEG), (ii) a blood-derived composite marker of systemic inflammation,
and (iii) ASD symptoms and quality of life. Additionally, half of participants will be recruited from a companion
study collecting positron emission tomography (PET) data using a translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) tracer to
measure neuroinflammation centrally, and an exploratory goal of this proposal is to investigate relations
between EEG-based responses to social rewards, PET-derived (i.e., central) measures of neuroinflammation,
and a blood-derived (i.e., peripheral) measure of systemic inflammation from the portion of autistic participants
who completed TSPO PET scans. This project will provide a deeper understanding of relations between neural
responses to social rewards, immune functioning, and symptom expression in ASD. It also has the potential to
contribute to the development of EEG-based measures that may be suitable endpoints in future mechanistic
trials investigating novel ASD interventions targeting inflammatory processes."

10953163,"Project Summary/Abstract
Spreading depolarization (SD) occurs following many acute neurological conditions and is characterized by the
loss of ion gradients across neuronal and astrocytic membranes. Recently, SD following stroke and cardiac arrest
has been linked to acute edema formation via excess inﬂux of cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF). This CSF is pulled into
the brain via the glymphatic system, which is a network of perivascular spaces (annular channels around vascu-
lature) connecting subarachnoid CSF with the brain interstitium. The mechanisms by which SD pulls CSF into
the brain are not well-understood. On the other hand, studies of migraine with aura indicate that SD can severely
diminish glymphatic function. To reconcile these seemingly contradictory results, we hypothesize that SD results
in three dominant competing effects that enhance or diminish glymphatic CSF ﬂow: potassium ion-dependent
vasodilation/vasoconstriction, swelling of astrocyte endfeet, and osmotic pressure gradients in surrounding brain
tissue. To disentangle the signiﬁcance of each effect experimentally, we propose the development of a novel
numerical simulation that couples a physiologically-realistic SD model to a detailed simulation of the glymphatic
system. We will do so by implementing and extending an existing physiologically-based model of SD to simulate
the spatiotemporal evolution of the concentration potassium, sodium, and chloride ions (Aim 1). We will then cou-
ple the SD model to an existing ﬂuid network model to capture disruption to the glymphatic system (Aim 2). This
network model will implement the three SD-related competing effects described above. Finally, we will perform in
vivo experiments with transgenic mice using two-photon microscopy to quantify vasculature/PVSs, SD propaga-
tion, and alterations to CSF ﬂow speed which will parameterize and validate our simulations. Development of this
validated simulation will constitute the ﬁrst comprehensive model of SD-induced glymphatic disruption, offering
fundamental insights into competing mechanisms of enhanced/diminished glymphatic ﬂow. In turn, this model
will lead to development of experimentally-testable hypotheses for mitigating SD-induced alteration to CSF ﬂow
in a variety of neurological conditions."
10872304,"PROJECT SUMMARY
An area of significant unmet need is the effective treatment of glioblastoma (GBM), an aggressive, fast-growing
brain cancer that represents 48% of all malignant brain tumors. If left untreated, GBM is typically fatal within
three months. Due to a high rate of recurrence, the current standard of care, consisting of safe maximal tumor
resection, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, only extends survival following initial diagnosis to 1 year, with
<5% of patients surviving longer than five years. Invasion and proliferation are defining hallmarks of cancer,
and in GBM, blocking one stimulates the other. This implies that effective therapy requires inhibiting both
simultaneously. We have found that the molecular motor myosin 10 (Myo10) meets these criteria. Myo10
deletion impairs invasion, slows proliferation, and prolongs survival in murine models of GBM. Although tumors
still form, Myo10 deletion also enhances tumor cell dependency on both DNA damage and metabolic stress
responses, inducing synthetic lethality when combined with FDA approved inhibitors of these processes.
Results demonstrate that a therapeutic strategy targeting Myo10 is expected to be tolerated and have an anti-
tumor effect that can also synergize with established therapies. However, pursuing the translational potential of
Myo10 in GBM has been limited by the complete lack of molecular probes for this myosin. Thus, the overall
goal of this proposal is to perform a large scale high throughput screening (HTS) campaign in the R61 phase
using the Scripps Institutional Drug Discovery Library (SDDL) of >665,000 compounds to identify and
subsequently validate, characterize and optimize first-in-class therapeutic agents targeting Myo10 in the R33
phase. Successful transition to the R33 phase will be determined by the Go/No-Go criteria of identifying at
least two chemically distinct structural scaffolds for optimization. Far more are anticipated and plans are in
place to prioritize hits. The inter-disciplinary team of investigators combines uniquely complementary expertise
in GBM, myosin biology, HTS screening, medicinal chemistry, drug development and the clinical treatment of
GBM. Preliminary data garnered from a 1.28K compound LOPAC screen demonstrates that the project is
ready for a full-scale HTS campaign, having demonstrated the primary assay is HTS compatible with an
excellent Z’, high assay reproducibility and a lack of false positives. Readiness is further supported by a
counterscreen in place that utilizes the same approach as the primary screen, titration assays and a
comprehensive screening funnel to support the medicinal chemistry. A primary lead and a back-up resulting
from these efforts will then be advanced under a different funding mechanism for development as a GBM
treatment (e.g. IGNITE in vivo efficacy PAR-18-761 and BPN Small Molecule Drug Discovery and
Development PAR-20-122). Further, we anticipate that the resulting small molecule inhibitors of Myo10 will
enable discovery of indications in addition to GBM where its modulation would be therapeutically beneficial."
10848388,"Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a dominantly inherited autosomal disease with the most common
manifestation being development of bilateral schwannomas of the 8th cranial nerve (Vestibular schwannoma).
The majority of NF2 patients develop additional tumors throughout the nervous system, including schwannomas,
meningiomas and ependymomas, causing severe morbidity and early mortality. The NF2 tumor suppressor gene
encodes for a 69-kDa protein called Merlin, implicated in the regulation of a number of signaling pathways, such
as those regulated by small G-proteins and the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway. Although our understanding of
the molecular mechanisms underlying NF2 has improved over the past two decades, effective therapies remain
lacking.
To date, systematic efforts to identify therapeutic agents for NF2 have demonstrated limited success, resulting
in identification of a small number of candidates that displayed minimal selectivity towards NF2-deficient cells.
Arguably, the reasons for this limited success stem from a number of factors including the fact these efforts relied
on approaches utilizing traditional screening assays performed with cells plated on plastic dishes, in 2-
dimensional (2D) monolayer formats. These conditions poorly reflect the environment cells experience in vivo.
In addition, previous screens were performed against a small collection of compounds that were pre-selected
based on drug-likeness, known pharmacology, regulatory status, etc. Thus, only limited chemical space has
been explored in these efforts.
Our long-term goals are to identify small molecules that selectively inhibit NF2-null Schwann cells and optimize
these into lead molecules that will be developed into therapeutic agents. Towards this goal we will implement a
screening campaign that incorporates a number of innovations that we already demonstrated to dramatically
improve discovery efforts. We hypothesize that the proposed research campaign will identify pharmacologically
tractable targets/pathways in NF2-null cells, which will be developed as leads for therapeutic development."
10952602,"SUMMARY
Manipulating neural activity to show causality is an essential approach in neuroscience, but manipulating
primate prefrontal cortex (PFC) presents unique challenges not addressed by current or nascent techniques. In
particular, the primate PFC often encodes information with spatially distributed and mixed activity patterns.
Current approaches for primates cannot target these patterns, and therefore cannot selectively modify the
information that the PFC encodes. To overcome this barrier we propose a novel approach using multi-channel,
low-current electrical stimulation guided by a state-space theoretical framework; this method aims to modulate
the subspace (spatially distributed patterns of neural activity) that encodes a specific task variable, with
minimal effects on other subspaces. To validate and refine this method, we use our recently developed primate
economic decision paradigm (Lupkin & McGinty, 2023, eLife), and exploit the known relationship between
choice behavior and economic value signals in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC, McGinty & Lupkin, 2023, Nat.
Neuro). In Aim 1 we will attempt to selectively modify the subjective value of a decision offer encoded in OFC,
and observe the effects on choice. The method uses dense multi-channel arrays (32 or 64 channels, 50µm
contact spacing) that can both record and electrically stimulate independently at each electrode (<10µA per
channel). We first sample multiunit neural activity from the array channels during decision-making, and use a
state-space framework to identify the neural subspace (linear combination of channels) that encodes value.
Then, stimulation on selected channels is expected to increase or decrease the subjective value of the
decision offer in each trial, and therefore make the offer more or less likely to be chosen. The magnitude and
specificity of stimulation effects will be refined by varying the number and density of stimulated channels, as
well as the currents applied to each channel. In Aim 2, the method will be used to test the currently unknown
role of OFC overt attention signals, by selectively modifying activity within the OFC’s attention-coding
subspace independent of its value-coding subspace. The results are expected set the stage for an R01
proposal whose objective is identifying the neural origins of attentional biases in economic choice in the OFC,
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and related prefrontal areas. The PI has extensive experience in decision-
making, primate OFC neurophysiology, and electrical stimulation techniques, and the feasibility of this new
method is supported by pilot data. The proposed study is significant because of the potential for a
transformative new technique that can link specific neural signals in PFC to higher cognitive functions that are
impacted in neuropsychiatric disease, such as decision-making, selective attention, working memory, social
cognition, and other executive functions. This technique would also complement current methods for
manipulating neurons based microcircuit function or genetically-defined markers, and could have applications
in next-generation stimulation-based neural prosthetic devices."
10953006,"Targeted Degradation of HIV Integrase as a Novel Treatment of Infection
PROJECT SUMMARY
Due to the development of antiretroviral therapy, HIV-1 infection is no longer a death sentence but rather a
treatable chronic disease, providing people with HIV an almost normal life expectancy. However, the most recent
WHO HIV Drug Resistance Report indicates that the prevalence of acquired and transmitted HIV drug resistance
has exponentially increased in the recent years. The prevalence of three and four-class resistant HIV is already
estimated to range from 5 to 10% in Europe, while somewhat lower rates are still reported for North America
(<3%). Indeed, pan-resistant viruses against some drug classes have already been reported. It seems inevitable
that fully drug resistant viruses will arise in the not-too-distant future, which necessitates the development of
novel anti-HIV drugs. Rather than continue to design new inhibitors for drug-resistant HIV, we propose an
alternative strategy – the development of proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) using existing anti-HIV
drugs. PROTACs are small, bifunctional molecules that contain a warhead domain specific to the targeted protein
of interest coupled by a short linker to an E3 ubiquitin ligase binding domain. Rather than working as a classical
inhibitor, these small molecules promote ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the target
protein. Using this technique to degrade pathological proteins has the added benefit that PROTACs can often
be used at concentrations significantly lower than standard inhibitors, as there is no need for PROTACs to be
present at stoichiometric concentrations. Once a PROTAC induces ubiquitination of the target protein, the protein
is degraded and the PROTAC is free to bind another protein and repeat the cycle. Of particular importance to
this project is that the transient nature of PROTAC interaction with, and subsequent ubiquitination of the target
protein means that a high affinity drug-target interaction is not as necessary as with classical stoichiometric
inhibitors. Indeed, PROTACs developed for oncogenic kinases using existing inhibitors as the warhead domain
were able to induce degradation of kinases with mutations that conferred resistance to the same inhibitors. We
postulate that it will be possible to target HIV proteins in virus that has become resistant to the inhibitory effect
of a drug with the corresponding PROTAC, due to the lower binding affinity required for degradation compared
to inhibition. Our early stage PROTACs designed to induce degradation of the HIV integrase enzyme show
nanomolar efficacy in both proteolysis of integrase, as well as a blockade of de novo HIV infection in T cells
using well-established assays. This application combines the expertise of investigators in PROTAC design and
biological assay development with that of an established research team at an NIH CFAR site. Our goal is the
development of proof-of-principle PROTACs that test the hypothesis that PROTACs are active against viruses
that have developed resistance mutations in the viral protein that is targeted by the PROTAC warhead. As
expected for an R21 application, this is a high-risk proposal; but if successful, the outcome will provide new
avenues for anti-HIV drug development for the increasingly resistant HIV virus."

undergird structural racism (SR) in the domains of mass incarceration (MI) and housing; and will examine the

housing as systems of exposure to SR that are given meaning by specific policies (as well as the legacies of
past policies) and that dynamically intersect with one another in ways that shape their impacts on population
and individual health. We will measure, in different ways, SR in, and at the intersection of, each of these
domains, at the national level and within the state of Connecticut (CT) and analyze their impacts on health and
race inequities in health. Focusing on the national level, Aim 1 will use legal policy mapping techniques and
factor analysis to develop quantitative indices of SR related to MI and housing and characterize state variation
in SR within and at their intersection. Using publicly available data sources, we will explore the association of
these indices alone and together, with race inequities in various measures of population health. This aim will
advance methods for measuring SR as codified in state polices and provide insights into potential policy
reforms for advancing racial health equity. Focusing on the state of CT for Aim 2, we will collaborate with
DataHaven, a non-profit CT-based organization that runs a bi-annual community well-being survey (DCWS)
conducted with a random sample of the population as part of its mission to empower people to create thriving
communities. We will add to the DCWS questions to capture in detail whether and how individuals have
interacted with the systems of MI and housing. Using latent class analysis, we will develop measures of
individuals’ exposure to these systems and with appropriate regression techniques analyze the impacts of
these different forms of exposure on their health and racial health equity. To understand whether and how
policy reforms may promote greater health equity, for Aim 3 we will focus locally and conduct a qualitative
analysis—using methods of critical policy ethnography—of the rollout and implementation of Clean Slate and
Right to Council policies recently passed in CT and with potential to address SR in the domains of MI and
housing, respectively. For these purposes, we will work with Health Equity Solutions, a CT community-based
non-profit organization focused on ensuring health equity is embedded in all policies, to analyze how a broad
range of policy implementers (including impacted individuals and communities) navigate, resist, and work to
confront SR as these policies are implemented. And we will consider the implications of this for racial health
equity. Together, these analyses will highlight how policies in the domains of MI and housing maintain SR and
produce race inequities in health, but also, how policy reforms in these domains may confront SR and
represent interventions to advance racial health equity."

Hair cells (HCs) are the specialized sensory cells of the inner ear that play a crucial role in transmitting
environmental information, such as sound and motion, to the brain. In adult mammals, HCs cannot regenerate
naturally. Therefore, a large effort has been made to understand the normal development of auditory and
vestibular HCs, so that effective regenerative therapies can be established. Technological advancements in
studying transcriptional control have provided valuable insights into the roles of different transcription factors
(TFs) such as ATOH1, POU4F3, GFI1, INSM1, TBX2, and IKZF2 in the development of HCs. However, the
application of certain tools, such as CRISPR-mediated gene activation and inhibition, for studying HC
development has been limited by the complicated use of animal models. Recently, a highly scalable protocol
was developed to guide mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) towards inner ear sensory cells in vitro. Over a
span of 2-3 weeks, these inner ear organoids produce sensory epithelia-like structures complete with
mechanosensitive HCs and underlying supporting cells. The development of this inner ear organoid model
facilitates the progress of cell-based assays for studying HC-specific development and testing potential
treatments for sensory cell loss. In this proposal, I aim to utilize the inner ear organoid model to investigate the
transcriptional control of HC development in vitro. To achieve this, I plan to:
I. Define the TFs involved in in vitro inner ear organoid HC development compared to in vivo HC
development.
II. Generate a versatile toolkit of mESC lines designed for inducible and reversible CRISPR-mediated gene
 activation and inhibition.
III. Utilize this toolkit to systematically investigate the roles of candidate TFs in organoid HCs through
 CRISPR-mediated knockdown and activation, followed by multi-omic analyses.
Successful completion of this project will not only uncover additional TFs essential for HC development but will
also provide a valuable resource for fellow inner ear researchers seeking to manipulate the expression of genes
of interest within inner ear organoid cell types."
10948156,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Major barriers to HIV cure include functional impairment of virus-specific CD8+ T cells and evasion of immune
detection by a reservoir of latently infected CD4+ T cells, both of which persist during antiretroviral therapy (ART).
Critical knowledge gaps in our understanding of the biology regulating both processes limit development of
effective immune therapies to obviate the need for lifelong adherence to ART in persons with HIV (PWH). The
long-term goal is to inform development of such therapies by elucidating molecular mechanisms underpinning
HIV-specific T cell dysfunction and viral persistence. The objective of the proposed research is to identify and
modulate molecular pathways that govern T cell antigen sensitivity in PWH. The rationale is that this information
will guide innovative strategies to combat HIV persistence. Based upon preliminary data identifying a previously
unrecognized T cell activation deficit, distinct from exhaustion, which underlies failure to durably control HIV
infection and an understudied role for monocyte–T cell interactions in altering antigen sensitivity, the central
hypothesis that modulation of T cell activation thresholds will facilitate immune clearance of HIV-infected cells
from persistent viral reservoirs will be examined in three research areas. The first aims to identify and perturb
regulatory mechanisms governing antigen-refractory HIV-specific CD8+ T cells, including their maintenance by
epigenetic control of inhibitory genes and/or cell surface receptors. The second research area aims to define
contributions of HIV-infected antigen-refractory CD4+ T cells to viral persistence, including characterization of
their proviral landscapes and their capacity for latency reversal. The third research area aims to harness
monocyte-mediated modulation of T cell activation thresholds for HIV elimination by defining cell-surface
interactions between monocytes and both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that modulate antigen sensitivity and then
examining their ability to improve HIV latency reversal and cytolytic viral clearance. The approach is innovative
because it examines novel concepts, establishes new collaborations, and applies high-resolution techniques to
investigate a newly identified dysfunctional T cell state using primary clinical specimens from PWH. The
proposed research is significant because its successful completion will reveal fundamental human T cell
immunobiology that can be exploited to enable the recognition and elimination of persistent HIV reservoirs by
autologous cellular immune responses."

This project will measure how exposures to climatic variability (i.e., temperature and precipitation anomalies)
during early-life and adolescence affect the fertility, health, migration, and socioeconomic statuses of working-
age adults. We use data from the Indonesian and Mexican Family Life Surveys to measure women’s fertility
(children ever born) and adults’ lifetime migration, body mass index, education, and consumption expenditures
among 15-49 year-old individuals in Indonesia (~115,000 observations from 51,000 individuals) and Mexico
(~60,000 observations from 41,000 individuals). We then link these demographic records to high-resolution
climate data, and measure individuals’ climate exposures during early childhood (ages -1 to 4) and
adolescence (ages 9 to 14). We fit a series of country-specific regression models that measure the effects of
climate exposures during each critical period on the focal outcomes, controlling for individual characteristics
and both birthplace and birth-year fixed effects. We then evaluate whether and how climate effects differ by
individuals’ age, sex, parental education, parental mortality, and rural (or urban) residence at birth. The third
analyses compare the effects of early-life and adolescent shocks with the impacts of contemporaneous shocks
that occurred just prior to when the focal outcomes were measured. These analyses also account for the
potential compounding or accumulation of impacts from repeated shocks. Our main analyses are
complemented by a series of robustness checks. Overall, we provide new insights into the links between
climate change and working-age adults’ wellbeing in middle-income, developing contexts."

Myopia is a complex and multigenic refractive disorder that does not only impair vision but also
increases the risk factor to develop irreversible blinding diseases later in life. While scleral
remodeling and decreased connective tissue synthesis have been shown to underly the excessive
axial elongation in myopia, the specifics of micro- and macro-level interactions remain elusive. In
this proposal, we plan to use tree shrew model of myopia. We hypothesize that infiltration of
peripheral immune cells, including myeloid cells correlate with myelin alterations, axonal/neuronal
damage ultimately leading to myopia development and progression. We plan to conduct this study
in two specific aims. First, we will assess alterations in axonal health, myelin and immune cell
infiltration in the optic nerve head (ONH) using immunohistochemical and novel spatial protein
profiling by Nanostring in moderate and high myopia. Next, we plan to correlate these micro-level
alterations with tissue level alterations from optical coherent tomography (OCT) images of the
ONH. We predict that alterations in axonal health, myelin, and inflammation will coincide with the
ONH remodeling visualized by OCT in the tree shrew model of myopia. This study will bridge the
gap in our understanding of localized molecular mechanisms and pathogenesis involved in ocular
remodeling during myopia development. It will ultimately open a whole new avenue towards
designing and developing novel treatment strategies that counteract the driving forces of myopia
development and progression."

have participation from school representatives, representing a major CDR implementation gap and
lack of actionable data for suicide prevention in the high-risk developmental period of adolescence.
The goal of this exploratory sequential mixed methods study is to explore barriers and facilitators to
school participation in CDR team meetings. The team’s location in Los Angeles County is a unique
strength because CDR methods were first developed in Los Angeles in 1978, and in 2000 Los
Angeles County began the only CDR devoted solely to adolescent suicide death. With substantial
connections to community partners to conduct this work, our team is uniquely equipped to complete
the proposed exploratory study, which (1) aligns with the developmental purposes of the R21
mechanism and (2) responds directly to the Notice of Special Interest in Mortality of Adolescents,
Young Adults, and Other NICHD Priority Populations in the United States (NOT-HD-23-001). We aim
to (1) explore facilitators and barriers to school representatives’ CDR participation for adolescent
suicide mortality; (2) explore school attorneys’ perspectives about school representatives’ CDR
participation for adolescent suicide mortality; and (3) describe school representatives’ experiences
with, concerns about, and recommendations for how to engage them in CDR team meetings. We will
conduct semi-structured interviews with (Aim 1) samples of school representatives (e.g., school
psychologists, social workers, counselors) and to explore emergent themes related to their concerns,
administrative processes, and decision-making about participating in a CDR team meeting. For Aim
2, we will interview school attorneys to explore how they advise schools about participating in CDRs,
probing about concerns of liability and confidentiality. We will use the interview data from Aims 1 and
2 to conduct a web-based survey (Aim 3) of school representative to describe leading barriers,
facilitators, and recommendations for CDR. School participation in CDR reviews is a major
undeveloped area of research for improving identification of mechanisms, correlates, and modifiable
risk factors of adolescent suicide mortality, and our team is well positioned to develop and test policy
and practice interventions to improve CDR participation based on the findings of this study."
10952828,"Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs), one of the most prevalent bacterial infections globally, present a
formidable health challenge, especially considering that 25-50% of UTIs, even with antibiotic intervention,
either persist or recur within a six-month frame. The intricacy of managing recurrent UTI (rUTI) is amplified due
to the infiltration of the bladder epithelium by uropathogenic bacteria. Intracellular bacteria are safeguarded
from antibiotics that cannot penetrate epithelial cell membranes, thus facilitating their persistence to initiate
recurrent infections. Noteworthy studies by Co-Is De Nisco and Zimmern, utilizing 16S rRNA fluorescence in
situ hybridization to analyze bladder biopsies from women with rUTI, have confirmed the existence of tissue-
invasive bacteria within the bladder wall. The majority of available therapies are unable to target these tissue-
resident bacteria.
 Electrofulguration (EF) is a therapy used to eradicate tissue-embedded bladder bacteria in women with
antibiotic-refractory UTI. By cauterizing visibly inflamed bladder areas, which are presumed to harbor tissue-
resident uropathogens, this treatment has provided symptomatic relief and reduced clinical incidence of rUTI.
However, its drawbacks include a six-month recovery period, pain, and the inability to differentiate between
infected and healthy tissue. Fulguration guidance relying on visual signs of inflammation hinders the specific
targeting of infected areas, potentially leading to the fulguration of healthy tissue and incomplete removal of
infected tissue. Therefore, targeted ablation of infected bladder areas is necessary to optimize outcomes for
rUTI patients and minimize pain and recovery duration.
 A breakthrough from the Gassensmith lab has led to the development of BactVue, a novel tool
hypothesized to enable the targeted ablation of infected bladder tissue, potentially revolutionizing current
treatment paradigms for antibiotic-refractory UTI. BactVue, a bacteria-selective stain, can permeate the cellular
bilayer of epithelial cells, bind to intracellular bacteria, and, when irradiated with an 808 nm laser, fluoresce to
reveal the location of intracellular bacteria and cause photothermal heating that kills the bacteria and
selectively destroys the infected tissue. The proposal aims to define the potential of BactVue to specifically
target and ablate infected bladder tissue through photothermal heating, hypothesizing that BactVue binds
selectively to both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria over mammalian cells.
 The proposal outlines two primary aims: to demonstrate the ability of BactVue to stain diverse
intracellular uropathogenic bacteria selectively and to leverage photothermal heating to enable the targeted
killing of cells harboring pathogenic bacteria labeled with BactVue. The project promises to advance
significantly the development of this transformative tool for clinical applications in managing antibiotic-refractory
rUTI."
10952477,"Project Summary
Controlling medical device associated infections is an unmet challenge due to high-level tolerance to
antibiotics. An important mechanism of such tolerance is the formation of persister cells, which are non-
growing phenotypic variants of bacterial cells. Because conventional antibiotics attack bacteria by inhibiting cell
growth related behaviors such as cell wall and protein syntheses, they are not effective against persister cells.
The capability to escape antibiotic treatment by persister formation and reestablish the bacterial population
after treatment is an important intrinsic mechanism of bacterial multidrug tolerance, which leads to chronic
infections and facilitates the development of multidrug resistance through acquired mechanisms based on
mutations and drug resistance genes. Despite the significance of persister cells, the mechanism of persister
formation is still not well understood and control of persister cells remains challenging. One major hurdle to
persister research is the lack of an animal model of bacterial persistence that is essential for understanding
host response to persister cells and for testing new antimicrobials and biomaterials for persister control.
 To address this grand challenge, this team will construct the first in vivo model to control and monitor
persister formation using blue light. An Escherichia coli strain will be engineered using synthetic biology.
Exposure to blue light will induce the toxin gene hipA and repress the antitoxin gene hipB in this strain, leading
to high-level persister formation. This process will be reversed by moving cells to the dark, resulting in persister
wakeup and reversion to normal cells. Additional components will be included to label all cells with
constitutively expressed green fluorescence protein (GFP) and normal cells with bioluminescence expressed
under a growth-rate-dependent promoter. After in vitro test, the constructed strain will be validated in an in vivo
mouse model of subcutaneous biomaterial infection with an engineered device that generates blue light
wirelessly. Persister formation and antibiotic treatment will be tested in this model. The effects will be
monitored using whole-animal imaging and the results will be corroborated with microbiological and
histopathological analyses after the mice are euthanized.
 This research team aims to better control persistent infections such as those associated with implanted
medical devices. This project will lead to an important millstone toward this ultimate goal by constructing the
first animal model of bacterial persistence. With the capability to control and monitor persister formation
noninvasively and in real-time, this system will be useful for both fundamental study of bacterial physiology and
for drug discovery and biomaterial design against this antibiotic tolerant population. Thus, this project falls well
within NIH’s definition of being contributive to ""improve people's health and save lives”."
10952479,"Abstract
Fentanyl’s high potency, facile synthesis, abuse liability, and propensity to cause profound respiratory
depression via the mu opioid receptor (MOR) have combined to create the opioid epidemic. Fentanyl now
accounts for ~80% of opioid overdose deaths and is predicted to contribute to more than 1.2 million deaths
during the current decade. The rapid onset of fentanyl-induced respiratory depression requires a fast-acting
therapy. For practical purposes, this needs to be a pharmacological treatment. The primary pharmacological
treatment for opioid overdose is naloxone. Naloxone is a competitive orthosteric antagonist of MOR and thus
its effectiveness depends on the dose of naloxone given, naloxone’s affinity for MOR compared to the opioid,
and the rate at which the opioid leaves the receptor. While naloxone can be lifesaving, there are numerous
examples of naloxone failing to reverse an opioid overdose, emphasizing the importance of improving the
pharmacological treatment of opioid overdose.
One way to improve naloxone’s efficacy at MOR is by using a negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of MOR.
NAMs decrease agonist signaling by either increasing the rate at which the agonist leaves the receptor or by
decreasing the efficiency of signaling. Either could be beneficial combined with naloxone to reverse an opioid
overdose. Interestingly, cannabidiol (CBD) is a low potency MOR NAM. In preliminary experiments, we
screened a CBD analog library for their ability to reverse fentanyl-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC).
We identified potent NAMs that reversed fentanyl inhibition of AC and fentanyl analgesia, but they failed to
prevent fentanyl induced respiratory depression or enhance naloxone reversal of respiratory depression.
These results suggest that pathways other than MOR inhibition of AC mediate fentanyl-induced respiratory
depression. Thus, in the proposed work, our first goal is to screen our candidate NAMs for attenuation of
fentanyl/MOR signaling across a broad range of signaling pathways with the goal of identifying CBD analogs
that inhibit MOR signaling pathways in addition to AC. Even though our potent MOR NAMs didn’t decrease
respiratory depression, an important second goal is to determine if they affect other key behaviors mediated by
fentanyl/MOR: reward, dependence, and tolerance. We will address these two goals with two specific aims.
Specific Aim 1. Screen the CBD analog library for attenuation of fentanyl/MOR modulation of the following
pathways: adenylyl cyclase, GIRK, MOR internalization, ERK1/2, phospholipase C, and arrestin.
Specific Aim 2. Determine the ability of the novel MOR NAM, JGC8, to attenuate key fentanyl/MOR-mediated
behaviors: reward, dependence, alleviation of neuropathic pain, and tolerance.
We feel Aim 1 will likely identify compounds with unique signaling profiles. Aim 2 will determine if the already
identified MOR NAM, JGC8, affects therapeutically important fentanyl-elicited behaviors and, combined with
results from Aim 1, will provide insights into the signaling pathways involved in these MOR-related behaviors."
10953253,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In the United States, prostate cancer is the most prevalent malignancy, with disproportionately higher incidence
and mortality rates among black men than their white counterparts. Black-white mortality disparities have been
examined with differences in treatment based on socioeconomic factors implicated. Apart from these
contributors, the effect of molecular and genetic factors on racial disparity is evident. Compared to earlier studies
focusing on heritable mutations and single-nucleotide polymorphisms, more recently, tissue-based genomic
analyses enabled by next-generation sequencing technologies have emerged to investigate race-specific
somatic alterations and their clinical implications, and have already generated promising findings. However,
tissue-based genomic analysis is extremely challenging in metastatic prostate cancer because, as a bone-
predominant metastatic disease, tissue samples are not always obtainable. Analyses based on circulation tumor
cells (CTCs), an emerging liquid biopsy approach, can provide global snapshots of primary and metastatic
tumors, and provide information on spatial and temporal heterogeneity on a scale that cannot easily be achieved
through analyses of tissue biopsy samples. With recent advances in single-cell technologies, analyses of CTCs
at single-cell resolution offer a noninvasive approach to characterize and monitor dynamic changes of cancers
from a multidimensional perspective. Nonetheless, studies on single-cell CTC analysis have rarely been
reported, partly due to the considerable technology challenges. Moreover, there is no study so far to examine
the mutational landscape of CTCs in the context of racial survival disparity. Recently, we have established a
comprehensive pipeline on the enrichment, enumeration, isolation, whole genome amplification, sequencing,
and data analysis of single CTCs. Based on this pipeline, we were recently awarded an NCI R01 project to
develop a large prospective prostate cancer patient cohort to determine mutational landscapes of single CTCs
with treatment response and disease progression in metastatic prostate cancer. Intriguingly, our pilot whole-
exome sequencing analysis of single CTCs showed a distinct mutational signature between black and white
patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Building upon these research strengths,
available resources, and preliminary data, we will conduct whole-exome sequencing of CTCs from paired black
and white patients to identify race-specific mutational signatures and evaluate their associations with racial
survival disparity in mCRPC. By applying the cutting-edge single-cell sequencing technology in a large ongoing
multi-ethnic cohort, this proposed study has the promise to identify novel genomic biomarkers that are associated
with racial survival disparity in mCRPC, which may assist in prognosis stratification, precision medicine, and
optimal management of prostate cancer patients, including racial minorities who are underrepresented in
previous molecular profiling studies."
10953291,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures, or PROMs, are powerful tools in cancer care to enhance clinician-
patient communication, identify problematic symptoms and treatment priorities, facilitate shared decision-making,
and prolong survival. Nonresponse significantly undermines the representativeness of PRO data that is routinely
collected as part of clinical care, thereby compromising its utility for promoting high-value, equitable patient-
centered care in cancer clinics. The lack of adequate representativeness also hampers the use of routinely
collected PRO data for quality improvement and value-based healthcare. There is an urgent need to delineate
the representativeness of PRO data collected in routine cancer care, identify the underlying causes of
nonresponse, and develop novel methods to ensure data representativeness. Despite compelling evidence that
expanding the reach of PROMs collection to underrepresented patients and improving their PROMs completions
are critical to ensure the representativeness of routinely collected PRO data, most of the current research
focuses on methods to increase collection instead of methods to enhance PRO data representativeness. The
overarching goal of this proposal is to characterize and delineate the causes of nonresponse and devise
mitigation strategies to improve the representativeness of PRO data collected in routine cancer care. By
examining the data of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global-10 measure
collected as part of routine care at seven Radiation Oncology clinics within the Mass General Brigham healthcare
system, we will (Aim 1) characterize the nonresponse of the Global-10 across clinic, provider, and patient levels;
(Aim 2) identify multilevel causes of nonresponse and potential strategies to improve representativeness in
PROMs collection; and (Aim 3) develop effective modifications to missing-data methods to enhance the
representativeness of pre-existing PRO data. Our expected outcomes are generalizable knowledge and
strategies to address nonresponse in PROMs, enhancing PRO data representativeness in routine cancer care.
The successful completion of this project will elucidate the characteristics of PROMs nonresponse and its
intricate associations with multilevel factors of successful large-scale PROMs collection in diverse patient
populations. Insights from this endeavor will also guide the evolution and development of PROMs collection
programs to expand their reach to underrepresented cancer patients and improve data representativeness. This
will, in turn, enable the utility of PRO data for quality improvement and high-value, equitable patient-centered
cancer care."

Human mimicry, referred to as synchronization or the ""chameleon effect,"" involves unconsciously imitating
gestures, behaviors, facial expressions, speech patterns, and even the emotions of others. This phenomenon is
pivotal in social interactions because it fosters social bonding, group cohesion, and cooperation by influencing
how others are perceived. Mimicry fosters conscious empathy, aiding individuals in understanding and
empathizing with the emotions and intentions of others. Meanwhile, animals also synchronize behaviors, but
there are no studies on the underlying circuit mechanisms due to the lack of laboratory paradigms. We have
developed a method to quantify the synchronization of emotional responses in mice and found that mice
synchronized conditioned freezing, which required the integration of visual social stimulus and the auditory
emotional cue. In both sexes, the positive synchronization required the ventral hippocampus (vHPC), its inputs
to the amygdala, and vision, suggesting that vHPC processes the partner's visual social stimuli and then feeds
it into the auditory fear circuit at the amygdala level to achieve synchrony by modulating freezing. Surprisingly,
vHPC inactivation caused sex-specific effects: male dyads lost the positive synchrony, but the females switched
from positive to ""negative synchronization"" and actively avoided aligning their freezing bouts. It suggests
fundamental sex differences in the socio-emotional integrator. We will test a hypothesis that a female-specific
superior colliculus-mediated alternative visual stream to the auditory fear circuit drives negative fear synchrony,
competing with the vHPC stream for positive synchrony. We will use chemogenetic disconnection in Aim 1 to
identify the specific synapses underlying negative synchrony and ex vivo recording in Aim 2 to identify sex
differences in the synaptic properties of the superior colliculus visual pathway. This study will generate
fundamental knowledge about sex differences in the integration of social visual information and auditory
emotional information and how the brain organizes even simple behaviors through competing circuits."
10948453,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Although adults with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) now live routinely to 50
years of age and beyond, their risk for adverse health outcomes is higher compared to older adults without
SLE due to the effects of cumulative end-organ damage. While frailty is recognized as an important marker of
vulnerability in SLE, limited research has focused on targeted strategies to improve clinically relevant
outcomes in frail and pre-frail older adults with SLE, suggesting an important unmet need.
 In keeping with Stage 1 of the National Institutes of Health Stage Model for behavioral intervention
development, the goal of this project is first to adapt and then to pilot test a social cognitive theory-based digital
exercise intervention for aging adults with SLE (≥50 years of age) stratified by frailty status. The FITTLE Senior
System (FSS) is an evidence-based digital exercise platform with team-driven social support features created
to promote physical activity (PA) in sedentary older adults without comorbid conditions. In this study, the FSS
digital software platform will be adapted, leveraging an established user-centered design approach, to meet the
needs of the SLE population, resulting in FSS-SLE. My overarching hypothesis is that FSS-SLE will be feasible
for and usable by both frail and pre-frail older adults with SLE. The specific project aims are to:
Aim 1: Adapt FSS for frail and pre-frail adults ≥50 years of age with SLE. Semi-structured interviews will be
conducted with rheumatologists and physical therapists, as well as frail and pre-frail aging adults with SLE to
generate suggestions for adaptation of the FSS program and to incorporate key stakeholder perspectives in
the refinement process.
Aim 2: Conduct heuristic and usability analyses of the adapted FSS-SLE prototype, essential components of
the user-centered design process, to identify any upfront functional problems (e.g., system glitches) with FSS-
SLE prior to conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). The heuristic analysis will be based on
existing exercise guidelines for frail older adults and design guidelines for aging adults. The usability analysis
will include frail and pre-frail adults ≥50 years of age with SLE.
Aim 3: Conduct a pilot double blind RCT to assess feasibility, usability, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy
of FSS-SLE in frail and pre-frail adults ≥50 years of age with SLE. Participants will be randomized to the
intervention or a PA educational control arm. Feasibility will be evaluated by recruitment and retention based
on findings from FSS. Usability and acceptability will be assessed through semi-structured interviews and
validated instruments. Preliminary efficacy will be examined through change in exercise self-efficacy, a critical
mediator of PA behavior, from baseline to 6, 12, and 24 weeks.
This project will generate preliminary data to support a multicenter RCT of FSS-SLE targeting frail and pre-frail
older adults with SLE to improve disability and health-related quality of life in this expanding target population."

Infants are vulnerable to infection due to their tolerogenic immune phenotype and limited adaptive
immune memory, which has limited the success of newborn vaccines. Trans-placental transfer of
immunoglobulin G (IgG) from mother to fetus provides crucial protection in the first weeks of life.
As such, maternal immunization has been implemented as a public health strategy to protect
infants against serious infections early in life. The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) plays a well-
defined role by binding to IgG and transporting it across the placental syncytiotrophoblast to the
stroma, which is followed by transport across the fetal capillary endothelium to the fetus, but
emerging evidence suggests low-affinity Fc gamma receptors FcγRIIb and FcγRIIIa might co-
regulate IgG transfer with FcRn. However, their role is less established and is often debated. As
the placenta develops with pregnancy progression, IgG transfer efficiency dynamically evolves
and fetal IgG concentrations at full-term pregnancy surpass maternal levels. Despite partial
success of maternal vaccines in reducing the occurance of some neonatal infections, current
vaccines do not provide comparable protection across pregnancies with varying gestational
length, placental and maternal immune features. Progress in this field has been limited by stark
inter-species differences in placental transfer confounding insights from rodent models, which is
exacerbated by the important regulatory challenges of studies involving pregnant women. A
mathematical mechanistic model of transplacental antibody transfer presents a novel alternative,
which takes individual maternal and placental information and predicts antibody levels in the
newborn. Our long-term goal is to realize the promise of personalized vaccines for mothers to
maximally immunize newborns. To achieve this goal, in this application, we will (i) identify the key
Fc receptors (FcR) and the mechanisms by which they mediate transfer through placental cellular
layers, (ii) determine antibody Fc features that best synergize with these FcR kinetics such as IgG
subclass and Fc N-glycosylation, and (iii) develop and validate a mechanistic model of IgG
transfer that combines these insights toward an in silico vaccine testbed. Our in-silico testing
platform will pave the way for rational design of vaccines, which is capable of saving tremendous
effort and budget for vaccine clinical trials by avoiding predictable low-efficacy strategies."
10948815,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
The nasal mucosa consists of two distinct compartments - olfactory neuroepithelium and respiratory
epithelium. As such, the nose serves as both a respiratory and as a sensory organ. Among the epithelial cells
strategically positioned at the apical surface at the site of interaction with the inhaled air in the olfactory and
respiratory epithelium are two populations of specialized cells with shared core mediator profile but distinct
receptor repertoire – the olfactory TRPM5+ microvillous cells (MVCs) and the respiratory solitary chemosensory
cells (SCCs). While bitter taste receptors, bitter tasting bacterial metabolites and succinate are well defined
ligands of respiratory tuft cells (tracheal brush and respiratory SCCs), the ligands and signaling pathways of
olfactory TRPM5+ MVCs are less well defined. We recently found that TRPM5+ MVCs detect allergens and the
danger signal ATP to generate proinflammatory mediators including cysteinyl leukotrienes and prostaglandins
in an in vitro system. We also demonstrated that allergen recognition by the olfactory TRPM5+ MVCs initiates
an aberrant response of stem cell proliferation in the absence of profound inflammation in the olfactory
mucosa. Here, we will determine how the TRPM5+ MVCs contribute to the integrated airway epithelial
response to allergens and the determinants of pro- vs anti-inflammatory programs directed by these new
members of the tuft cell family.
 In Aim 1, we will define the signaling components engaged upon allergen detection by TRPM5+ MVCs. In
Aim 2, we will determine how signals detected by TRPM5+ MVCs are propagated in the olfactory
neuroepithelium, and the mediators (eicosanoids, epithelial cytokines, acetylcholine) generated by TRPM5+
MVCs or immediately downstream of them.
 Findings here will clarify how the olfactory TRPM5+ MVC tuft cells detect allergens, the consequences of
their activation, and possible therapeutic targets."

 Prescription opioid addiction is a significant problem characterized by compulsive drug seeking,
withdrawal and chronic relapse. Despite the growing impact of prescription opioids on public health, relatively
few pre-clinical studies have investigated the neurobiological mechanisms underlying self-administration of
oxycodone, a commonly prescribed medication. Neural circuits in the extended amygdala mediate emotional
behaviors, and dysregulation of these reward and stress systems is a hallmark of drug dependence and
withdrawal. Models of intravenous drug self-administration are a standard paradigm for investigating the
reinforcing effects of drugs, and I have developed a model of oxycodone self-administration under extended
access conditions (12 hours/day) that produces robust escalation of drug-seeking behavior and provides a
translationally relevant model of opioid abuse. We hypothesize that escalation of oxycodone abuse and
dependence are mediated by withdrawal-induced changes in neural signaling mechanisms, and that the
manipulation of these underlying neural systems will attenuate the promotion of drug-seeking behavior. We will
test this hypothesis using behavioral pharmacology, chemogenetics, and immunohistochemistry in a rat model
of oxycodone self-administration under extended access conditions.
 My research training will be supervised by my mentors, Drs. Michael Taffe, Thomas Kash and Candice
Contet, with additional support from Dr. Bryan Roth as consultant and Drs. Marisa Roberto, Kim Janda and
Michael Forster as advisors for my career development. We have designed a multidisciplinary project that
utilizes different experimental modalities that allow for behavioral, biochemical, and immunohistochemical
investigation of oxycodone addiction and dependence. Precise characterization of KOR activation will be
achieved through the use of the chemogenetic technology, designer receptors exclusively activated by
designer drugs (DREADDs). We will employ neural circuit manipulations, specifically the inhibitory Gi-coupled
kappa opioid receptor DREADD (KORD) in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) GABAergic projection to
paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) to understand the effect of opioid-induced
neuroadaptations mediating drug-seeking behavior. I will train in DREADD-based and immunohistochemical
techniques to complement my experience in behavioral opioid pharmacology. These skills will be acquired
during my K99 phase at The Scripps Research Institute and will be further implemented at my new institution
during the R00 phase. My mentor team will help me establish these techniques in my independent laboratory
to ensure experimental reproducibility. Collectively, this work will provide insight into the influence of kappa
opioid receptor signaling in amygdalar pathways mediating opioid addiction and dependence-induced
behavior."

The continuing advancement of single-cell technologies has ushered us into an exciting era of single-cell spatially
resolved transcriptomics (scSRT). scSRT by in-situ sequencing (ISS) or multiple rounds of barcode-based
hybridization (BCH) can quantify the 2D and even 3D positions of transcripts from hundreds and thousands of
genes for individual cells in intact tissues. Emerging applications of scSRT have demonstrated new capabilities
to characterize transcriptional complexity associated with tissue heterogeneity and cellular microenvironment in
both physiological and pathological contexts. To fully harness the potential of scSRT, innovative computational
tools that can leverage the spatial information of cells and transcripts to tackle the rising challenges are needed.
The goal of this application is to develop innovative models that enable the use of scSRT data to identify tissue
structures and pathologies, provide the underlying spatial cellular and molecular signatures associated with the
pathologies, and discover novel pathological manifestations in previously uncharacterized or new diseases. We
have previously analyzed normal and COVID-19 patient lung tissue samples using ISS. We found that popular
algorithms for spatial expression clustering based on graph neural networks (GNN) could not capture tissue
structure or COVID-19 pathology. To properly model spatial expression domains consistent in tissue histology,
we hypothesize that Graph Deep Learning (GDL) models could learn structure-aware spatial patterns that
capture histology and gene expression signatures from scSRT data. We further hypothesize that a semi-
supervised strategy analogous to semantic image segmentation that utilizes partial annotations would enable
GDL to define the heterogeneity of pathological regions. To test these hypotheses, we have collected and
processed multiple scSRT datasets from different technologies measuring spatial expressions in both normal
and disease conditions in various tissues. In this project, we propose to develop a contrastive learning-based
geometric graph attention model to learn tissue geometry-aware gene expression representations (Aim 1) and
a semi-supervised node classification on the geometric graph to segment tissue pathology domains from spatial
gene expression with few annotations (Aim 2). We will systematically evaluate the model performances by
comparing them against carefully annotated histology regions using the collected datasets. The developed
models can be used to discover novel pathological manifestations in diseases, particularly in previously
uncharacterized or new diseases and provide the spatial cellular and molecular signatures underlying the
pathologies. As scSRT is anticipated to revolutionize the study of cellular biology and disease pathology, the
proposed models will have a transformative impact on the computation and machine learning methods for SRT
analyses."

Even two decades after the complete sequencing of the human genome, a significant subpopulation (~10%) of
the encoded proteins remains unknown. The questions surrounding this “dark” proteome are further
compounded because there is not a one-to-one correspondence between genes and proteins and the function
of expressed proteins can be changed by hundreds of different types of post-translational modifications. The
resulting protein variants, or proteoforms, could be in the millions and may appear at concentrations well below
the detection limit of current methods. Mass spectrometry (MS) is one of most powerful tools in the modern
proteomics toolbox; however, MS only measures things that can be ionized and promoted to the gas phase,
highlighting the importance of the ionization process. Today, measurement of high-abundance proteins is a trivial
task for modern mass spectrometers, but closer examination reveals that low-abundance proteoforms
comprising the “dark” proteome remain elusive. Therefore, new measurement capabilities are urgently needed
that can increase the sensitivity and selectivity of the ionization process. While improvements in MS
instrumentation are expected to continue, a parallel approach relying on chemical methods to increase sensitivity
would provide a synergistic route to detect low abundance proteoforms. Here, we outline a high-risk but high-
reward strategy for improving the ionization efficiency of these low abundance peptides and post-translationally
modified peptides. Specifically, proof-of-concept experiments will demonstrate that N-heterocyclic carbene
(NHC) decorated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are an excellent platform for the selective capture and fragment-
free ionization of peptides, delivering at least two orders of magnitude improvement over state-of-the-art
methods. Additionally, we will demonstrate that these NHC-AuNPs can improve the detection of post-
translationally modified proteins and are compatible with pre-existing proteomics workflows employing
bioorthogonal click chemistries. Lastly, while the proof-of-concept studies proposed here target bottom-up MS
proteomics applications, the NHC mass tag platform is quite general and would have broader implications for
MS applications ranging from tissue and single-cell imaging to disease biomarker identification and detection."

In the brain, neurons are connected by intermingled excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) synapses. The correct E/I
balance is essential for proper brain function. Recent in vivo studies demonstrate that excitatory and inhibitory
synapses communicate with each other locally and inhibitory synapses could actively regulate the structure and
function of excitatory synapses. In vivo optogenetic stimulation and suppression of inhibitory activity decreases
and increases the stability of excitatory synapses, respectively. Our preliminary two-photon imaging and
chemogenetic data further show that PFC interneuron activity may affect excitatory synaptic plasticity throughout
brain development. These data strongly suggest that inhibitory synapses heterosynaptically regulate excitatory
synapses. However, there is much yet unknown about the cellular and synaptic mechanisms by which inhibitory
GABAergic synapses locally regulate excitatory glutamatergic synapse formation and elimination during brain
development. Using advanced optical techniques, this R21 grant proposal addresses key questions of
fundamental significance; 1) how do inhibitory synapses heterosynaptically regulate excitatory synapse structure
and function throughout brain development in an age-dependent manner? And 2) what signaling mechanisms
underlie the cross-talk between inhibitory and excitatory synapses during development and plasticity of neural
circuits? Our work will provide a powerful experimental framework for understanding how the brain achieves and
maintains E/I balance, and how this balance is altered in neurodevelopmental disorders arising from E/I
imbalance such as autism and schizophrenia."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) causes one of the world’s most deadly infections. Initially, Mtb infects alveolar
macrophages (AMs), and over time, it disseminates into monocytes, interstitial and recruited macrophages, and
neutrophils. Once an adaptive immune response develops, CD4 T cells promote the ability of macrophages to
control Mtb, although the mechanisms by which CD4 T cells confer protection are not fully understood. In addition
to secreting diffusible cytokines like IFN-, cognate interactions between CD4 T cells and Mtb-infected
macrophages are important for Mtb control. At the same time, Mtb undermines macrophage-T cell interactions.
Thus, optimizing macrophage-T cell interactions may be an effective strategy to generate protection. However,
until now, there has not been a way to determine which macrophages have presented antigen to CD4 T cells.
We discovered that Mtb-infected macrophages induce the cell surface molecule SLAMF1 (SLAM/CD150) in
response to cognate interactions with CD4 T cells. We show that SLAMF1 distinguishes macrophages that are
infected and have interacted with T cells from uninfected, bystander macrophages that experience the same
cytokine milieu, both in vivo in mice and ex vivo in macrophage-T cell co-cultures. Moreover, we found that
Slamf1-/- mice have higher Mtb burden in the lungs, enhanced inflammatory cell recruitment, altered cytokine
responses, and die earlier from TB compared to WT mice. Macrophage Slamf1 expression also correlates with
protection in non-human primates. SLAMF1 is a type I transmembrane receptors that is found exclusively on
hematopoietic cells. SLAMF1 mediates cell-cell signaling through homotypic SLAMF1-SLAMF1 interactions, and
it can also directly bind bacteria. We hypothesize that when macrophages present antigen to CD4 T cells,
macrophages to upregulate SLAMF1, which promotes control of Mtb in the macrophages by activating reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and autophagy-related pathways. Activated T cells also express SLAMF1, and we
propose that SLAMF1 signaling from macrophages to the T cells promotes resolution of inflammation. Thus,
activating SLAMF1 may improve Mtb control while reducing immunopathology. Here, making use of Slamf1fl/fl
conditional knock-out mice that we made, we will determine the cell type specific roles of SLAMF1 during TB.
Using transwell assays to study macrophage-T cell interactions, we will establish whether macrophage-CD4 T
cell interactions and SLAMF1 contribute to Mtb control in human and murine macrophages. We will establish
whether CD4 T cells and SLAMF1 drive macrophage ROS production and autophagy, whether this pathway is
undermined by Mtb virulence factors, and whether it can be augmented by small molecules and SLAMF1
agonists. Finally, making use of Slamf1 reporter mice that we made, we will elucidate the dynamics of early
macrophage-T cell interactions during Mtb infection, and how these interactions are altered by vaccines, trained
immunity, and contained infection. These studies will yield mechanistic insight into early events in host immunity
to TB and support the development of novel therapies and vaccines to generate sterilizing immunity."

PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 are mechanosensitive ion channels that convert force into chemoelectric signals. PIEZOs
play diverse roles in physiological processes such as touch, proprioception, breathing, and vascular
development. Pathogenic mutations in PIEZOs can cause extensive sensory defects and debilitating
neurological diseases such as distal arthrogryposis. Despite recent advances in elucidating the physiological
roles of PIEZO ion channels, the underlying structural correlates of function are largely unknown. PIEZOs are
homotrimeric ion channels with extensive blades of transmembrane domains that are thought to be the principal
transducers of mechanical force, but static structural snapshots and in vitro studies are poorly equipped to
describe which structural rearrangements underlie channel gating. To address these fundamental gaps in
knowledge, this proposal will use fluorescence nanoscopy to determine the structural mechanics of PIEZO ion
channels in a cell at single molecule resolution. These structural mechanics will then be correlated with the
functional output of the channel using electrophysiology. Aim 1 will determine which unique structural mechanics
underlie the functional differences between PIEZO1 and PIEZO2. This will be accomplished by examining how
the cellular environment and intrinsic structural mechanics shape the functional output of each channel. Aim 2
will define how the interplay between the protein and the plasma membrane shapes the activity of PIEZOs,
especially in the context of pathogenic gain-of-function mutations that cause distal arthrogryposis. This will be
accomplished by manipulating the lipid composition of the plasma membrane and by assessing how diverse
modulators shape the structure of the channel. This proposal will ultimately provide fundamental insight into how
PIEZO ion channels function inside of a cell and provide a foundation for the study of other sensory ion channels."

Youth electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is a public health concern. Many youths are eager to quit vaping, and
our prior study estimated that 67.3% of adolescent vapers reported past-year quit attempts, with an average of
5.3 times past-year quit attempts. However, the overall success of vaping cessation remains low, and a majority
of adolescent vapers had unassisted quit attempts. Meanwhile, current e-cigarette use is significantly more
prevalent among high school than middle school students, and over 90% of frequent adolescent vapers are
those aged 15-18 years old. It is imperative to develop age-appropriate vaping cessation interventions with a
focus on older adolescents to address their specific needs, thus curbing the high vaping prevalence among this
vulnerable population. The family environment is essential for youth growth, and parental support has long been
documented as a critical protective factor for youth substance use. In 2022, nearly 1 in 6 adolescent vapers
seeking assistance for quitting had already sought advice from their parents or caregivers, and more adolescent
vapers had asked for advice from their parents than using a mobile app or text messaging program. Peer coach
has been a successful strategy in tobacco and other substance cessation programs, and connecting parents of
current adolescent vapers with the community of parents who have successfully helped their kids quit vaping
can be an effective intervention to improve the intervention fidelity and effectiveness. Grounded on the Social
Influence model and the Social Cognitive Theory, this feasibility study aims to develop and test a Parents-
helping-Parents for youth Vaping Cessation (PhP-VX) program by providing parent-facilitated youth vaping
cessation intervention. In Aim 1, our multidisciplinary team will partner with Parents Against Vaping e-cigarettes
(PAVe), a national advocacy and education organization with nearly 14,000 race/ethnic diverse parent
supporters, to advance the translation of epidemiological research on youth vaping and inputs from an advisory
board (i.e., parents and adolescents) into a multifaceted vaping intervention that provides online training sessions
and weekly parent-to-parent support. In Aim 2, We will conduct a feasibility pilot test with 100 dyads recruited
through pediatric EHR systems, with half receiving the “PhP-VX” program and the other half in the control group
for 3 months, with assessments conducted at baseline, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up. In Aim 3, we will explore
the effectiveness of the intervention with saliva cotinine-validated past 7-day point prevalence abstinence as the
primary outcome. This study is novel for using EHR to identify and enroll adolescent e-cigarette users and
incorporating PhP peer support into the youth vaping cessation program. This feasibility study is highly significant
in addressing youth vaping cessation in partnership with a robust community-based organization. The success
of this R34 study will prepare us for a future R01 pragmatic trial to test the efficacy of PhP-VX through EHR and
parent support in multiple pediatric clinics.

The proprioceptive sense largely derives from two specialized receptor organs in skeletal muscle: muscle
spindles (MSs) and Golgi tendon organs (GTOs). The afferents associated with these sensory end organs are
groups Ia and II MS-afferents and group Ib GTO afferents, which relay information about limb movement and
position (MS), or muscle load (GTO) from the peripheral receptors to the spinal cord and brainstem. MS afferents
are the primary kinesthetic sensors that enhance their firing rates with increases in muscle length, which in turn
serves as an indirect readout of joint position. While MS group Ia afferent can relay dynamic changes, MS group
II afferents are, on average, more sensitive for static stretch when compared to group Ia afferents and are far
more numerous. These observations have led to the idea that group II afferents are the main mediators of limb
and body position sense. Group II afferents therefore not only play a key role in various motor functions, but also
are central to the sense of self and agency, the sense of being in control of one’s actions. Despite their
importance, systematic analyses of group II function or their downstream neural circuits remains scarce.
 Historically, a key difficulty in studying group II afferents has been the inability to clearly distinguish them
from MS group Ia afferents through physiological or genetic means. Most stimuli that activate group II’s will also
activate group Ia’s and genetic reporters for individual proprioceptor subtypes were not yet identified. In recent
years, however, my lab identified expression of Neurexophilin 1 (Nxph1), a member of the Neurexophilin family
of secreted glycoproteins as a universal marker for MS group II afferents. Additional expression analyses indicate
that the Nxph1 locus offers a unique opportunity to study the development, circuitry and function of mouse group
II proprioceptive muscle afferents. Towards this goal, this proposal will develop and validate a novel Nxph1:Cre
animal model to enable the selective manipulation of adult group II muscle spindle afferents. These experiments
will provide the research community with a new genetic mouse model that will be essential for the study of group
II muscle afferents in health and disease."

Better model systems are needed to improve our understanding of how tissues develop, function, and
regenerate in order to design more effective biomedical therapies. Synthetic hydrogel matrices have been
widely used in these applications and have significant advantages as fully defined systems that can be tailored
to specific biomedical applications through the inclusion bioactive ligands within matrices having tunable
viscoelasticity. However, the extracellular matrix (ECM) that surrounds cells in tissues contains numerous
proteins and biopolymers that are dynamically modified by cells, and which aspects of cell-ECM interactions
are most important for recapitulating physiological adhesions is an area of active research. All adherent cell
types use both syndecans and integrins to mediate cell attachment to the ECM and measure the local
viscoelastic properties. However, most hydrogel systems are often functionalized with a single integrin-binding
RGD ligand covalently attached to the polymer network, which does not bind syndecans and cannot be re-
arranged by cells. We propose to develop a platform technology that can be used to better mimic cell-ECM
interactions found in tissues. This will be done by including dynamic ligands for both integrins and syndecans
within a hydrogel having tunable viscoelastic properties. We have developed a platform that utilizes
interpenetrating networks of covalent and multiplexed non-covalent polymers to enables us to independently
tune the mobility of multiple adhesion ligands in addition to both the stiffness and stress relaxation of the
hydrogel. We hypothesize that including dynamic ligands for syndecans will lead to cell-matrix adhesions that
better recapitulate those found in tissues, and this will increase osteogenic differentiation of human
mesenchymal stem cells within viscoelastic matrices. We will test this hypothesis in two aims. The First Aim
utilizes a multiplexed system containing multiple discrete self-assembling peptide nanofiber networks, each
which can be functionalized with ligands for either integrins or syndecans having tunable mobility. Different
ligand combinations and mobilities will be tested the number and size of focal adhesions will be quantified, in
addition to the extent of actin network formation. The Second Aim will utilize covalent and non-covalent
networks to tune the viscoelastic properties of the hydrogel to understand how syndecans and integrins
combine to transduce mechanical signals that drive cell behavior. We will culture hMSCs in gels having
different viscoelastic properties and ligand compositions to understand and quantify how dynamic syndecan
ligands increase osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs. The PI has significant experience designing dynamic,
viscoelastic hydrogel matrices to target specific cell-matrix interactions. This proposal will both help develop a
highly modular engineering platform that can be applied to a range of tissue systems, while also uncover
design rules for recapitulate physiologically relevant cell-matrix interactions within synthetic systems."

Spinal muscular atrophy is a monogenic motor neuron disease and is historically a leading inherited cause
of death in infancy and childhood. While development of SMN-dependent therapies has significantly
improved patient outcomes, continued neurological deficits in most patients highlights the need for SMN-
independent therapeutics to improve motor neuron (MN) function and survival. This effort is hindered by
the lack of understanding of how SMN deficiency impacts MN development and degeneration. Our
laboratory recently demonstrated that severely impaired proximal motor axon radial growth beginning at
mid-late embryogenesis and rapid degeneration of the entire MN postnatally are prominent features of
type I SMA patients, but the molecular mechanisms driving these cellular events and the importance of
these pathologies to milder forms of SMA are unknown. Historically, it has been difficult to obtain
transcriptomic data from MNs in vivo due to their sparseness within the spinal cord, and while in vitro
models can provide detailed transcriptomic data, these models forgo MN heterogeneity and the
complexity of the spinal cord environment. To circumvent these difficulties, we have collaborated with
Dr. Le Pichon at the NIH to produce two SMA mouse models that express GFP-tagged Sun1, a nuclear
envelope protein, in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) positive neurons of the spinal cord for FACS
sorting and subsequent single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq). Using snRNAseq, we aim to
elucidate the aberrant developmental pathways that drive early stages of SMA pathogenesis, and further
compare the magnitude and temporality of the identified mechanisms in severe and mild models of SMA.
We aim to do this by characterizing and performing snRNAseq on two SMA mouse models, the severe
model (Smn-/- SMN2+/+) and a mild model (Smn2B/-). Each model will be behaviorally and histologically
characterized in Aim 1 to identify appropriate time points for snRNAseq in Aim 2. In Aim 3, genes and
pathways of interest will be validated using qRT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and protein quantification in
both mouse models and in human autopsy tissues. Together, these studies aim to identify shared and
divergent developmental and degenerative mechanisms across the spectrum of disease severity to inform
future therapeutic development."

Heart attacks, or myocardial infarctions (MI), remain a leading cause of death worldwide. As adult human hearts
have limited regenerative capacity, cardiomyocytes (CMs) lost after MI are replaced by fibrotic scar tissue,
leading to cardiac dysfunction and often heart failure. A promising approach to replace lost CMs is direct
reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) into induced cardiomyocyte-like cells (iCMs) using the specific
cardiac lineage transcription factors Mef2c, Gata4 and Tbx5 (MGT). Over the last decade, considerable progress
has been made in understanding the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of iCM generation. However, post-
transcriptional processes, including translation and mRNA modification, are also important to regulate gene
expression. Post-transcriptional regulators have recently been shown to play critical roles in cell fate
determination, but their roles in direct cardiac reprogramming are largely unknown. Recently, Dr. Xie identified
the RNA binding protein Ybx1 and the m6a reader Igf2bp1 as critical post-transcriptional barriers to iCM induction.
Excitingly, upon removing Ybx1, a single factor, Tbx5, could successfully reprogram fibroblasts into iCMs. Thus,
in Aim 1, Dr. Xie will use ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq to characterize the mechanisms by which the innovative
cocktail Tbx5+siYbx1 generates iCMs. Then, taking advantage of the reduced cargo size of this cocktail, Dr. Xie
will develop a clinically relevant lipid nanoparticle-mRNA delivery system to achieve in vivo iCM conversion in a
mouse MI model. Post-transcriptional mRNA m6a methylation is another regulator of gene expression important
in cell fate maintenance. In addition to serving as a barrier to cardiac reprogramming, Dr. Xie found that the m6a
binding protein, Igf2bp1, formed cellular granules in CFs. She, therefore, hypothesizes that Igf2bp1 sequesters
or otherwise regulates the stability of m6a mRNAs in CFs by regulating cellular RNP granule dynamics and that
loss of Igf2bp1 leads to a shift in mRNA metabolism promoting cardiac fate conversion. To test these hypotheses,
aim 2 is to identify m6a alternations associated with iCM generation, map precise RNA binding sites of Igf2bp1
and elucidate the underlying mechanism through which Igf2bp1-mediated cellular granule formation regulates
the induction of iCMs. The proposed work will not only fill critical gaps in our mechanistic understanding of how
post-transcriptional regulation impacts cardiac fate conversion, but also advance iCM reprogramming closer to
therapeutic application through the development of an LNP-mRNA delivery system. With an excellent mentoring
team and a stimulating research environment at UNC Chapel Hill, Dr. Xie will learn cutting-edge techniques and
hone her professional skills, which will provide a solid foundation for her future research in studying the
mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and to use insights from this work to develop novel therapies to improve
patients’ lives. This K99/R00 award will support the development of her unique and comprehensive research
program and catalyze the transition to independence."

 The choroid plexus (CP) is a critical component of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), whose function is known to
degrade with aging. A better understanding of CP biology and how this biology shifts with age is a prerequisite
for utilizing the CP for blood-to-brain delivery of anti-aging drugs and may reveal new therapeutic targets in the
CP for age-associated diseases. One long-term goal of this project is to reveal how CP behavior, and transcytotic
protein transport from the blood to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specifically, changes with aging. Technical
challenges inherent in this goal require new proteomic methods. Therefore, a second long-term goal of this
project is to bring proteomic technology, and targeted proteomics in particular, to a level where any set of
peptides can be detected and quantified with high sensitivity and dynamic range, even in challenging samples
such as CP and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
 In my current work, I develop targeted proteomic methods based on the recently published GoDig targeted
proteomic technology, which enables simultaneous detection and quantification of hundreds of targets in up to
18 biological samples in a single run. I have submitted a manuscript to Journal of Proteome Research as a first
author describing a next-generation version of GoDig with much higher success rates, quantifying over 95% of
400 peptides. However, this method is still limited by the required pre-assembly of a data library, which is
infeasible to do with synthetic chemical labels and low-protein-amount samples such as mouse CP and CSF. I
have developed a new method using deep learning-based prediction to eliminate this requirement, resulting in a
method with superior flexibility and ease of use. In Aim 1, I propose to complete this method, using automatic
statistical scoring to ensure reproducibility (Subaim 1.1) and using theoretical spectra in place of deep-learning-
based spectrum predictions where necessary to enable library-free targeted proteomics of peptides with any
modification (Subaim 1.2), including those derived from the synthetic probes used in Aims 2 and 3.
 Aims 2 and 3 describe using targeted proteomics to study blood-to-brain transport in aging. In Aim 2, I
propose to characterize the kinetics of blood-to-CSF translocation by several known and suspected CP-crossing
blood plasma proteins in young and aged mice. I will chemically label recombinant proteins, inject them into the
bloodstream, and then track their passage from blood to CSF by collecting CSF at various time points, enriching
the labeled peptides from the digested CSF, and performing targeted detection and quantification. In Aim 3, I will
study proteins on the CP surface, measuring the kinetics of movement from the blood-facing surface to the CSF-
facing surface, which occurs in transcytosis. I will use in vivo bioconjugation and click chemistry to create a
chemical “double label” that conclusively signifies this movement; this double labeling is a novel and powerful
strategy for studying protein translocation. Detection and quantification of the double label with GoDig will reveal
how the kinetics of transcytosis in the CP change with aging."

Neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), epilepsy, and schizophrenia, are
collectively common conditions in the human population. Many studies have shown that NPDs have a significant
genetic component, reaching upwards of 80-90% heritability, and include common and rare genetic variation
acting additively. However, much of this heritability remains unexplained by studies to date, which have largely
focused on inspecting isolated slices of the human genetic variation spectrum, focusing on gene discovery within
one specific NPD. This K01 proposes to provide extensive training and conduct in-depth analyses using an
integrative approach to statistical analyses that accounts for the complete spectrum of human genetic variation
across multiple NPDs. Such an approach will not only increase the power to uncover gene associations but will
also fill much-needed gaps in our understanding of the shared and distinct genetic architecture of NPDs.
In Aim 1 of this K01 proposal, I will receive extensive training in cross-NPD genetics, and will apply a rare variant
association framework to ASD, epilepsy, and schizophrenia for joint NPD gene discovery. For Aim 2, I will learn
new skills from leading experts in genetic association methods of common and noncoding variation for NPDs.
Finally, for Aim 3 of my proposal, I will combine my newly acquired expertise from Aim 1 and Aim 2 to develop
frameworks and methods that will account for variants ranging from common to rare, from single-nucleotide to
structural, and from coding to noncoding across NPD phenotypes to better define the complete genetic
architecture of these complex neurological phenotypes.
For this proposal, my mentors and I have developed a comprehensive training plan to continue my transition to
independence that will enable me to develop a research program at the forefront of neuropsychiatric genetics.
My academic background consists of my undergraduate training in statistics at Duke University and a PhD in
biostatistics from Johns Hopkins University. My postdoctoral training at the Center of Genomic Medicine (CGM)
and Department of Neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and at the Broad Institute has greatly
advanced my expertise in the genetics of complex disorders, especially ASD, and have cultivated my interest in
studying NPDs. The overarching goal of this career program is to expand my understanding of NPD biology
beyond ASD and to develop expertise in the modeling of common and noncoding variation. My mentors (Primary:
Dr. Talkowski, Secondary: Dr. Mark Daly) and advisory team (Drs. Kathryn Roeder, Alicia Martin, Elise Robinson,
and Jordan Smoller) will supervise my scientific progress and collaboratively provide mentorship for soft skills
development, including the responsible conduct of research, lab management, result communication, and grant
writing. This tremendous mentorship team and the cutting-edge training environment of this proposal will catalyze
my transition to an independent research career studying NPD genetics."

HABs occur when colonies of algae grow out of control and negatively impact ecosystems. These blooms can
produce toxins that can have detrimental effects on animals and can also make humans sick. Blooms caused
by cyanobacteria (CB) in freshwater systems are prevalent across the U.S. and are expected in increase with
rising water temperatures and more frequent and severe weather events. CB produce toxins, including
microcystin-LR (MC-LR) and cylindrospermopsin (CYL), that are associated with acute liver and kidney toxicity
after exposure through ingestion of contaminated food or water. Inhalation exposures are increasingly
recognized as an important exposure route yet few studies have examined whether inhaled HAB aerosols have
subacute health implications. Compared to water, atmospheric transformation of HAB components occur rapidly
and tend to occur faster in air than in water. Toxins can be complexed with algal organic matter which may also
aid in photooxidation. Uncovering the atmospheric aging of HAB is critical to defining inhalation exposures and
associated health effects. Acute respiratory symptoms (i.e., coughing) have been documented in people near
CB blooms but no studies have investigated subacute effects. Data from animal and cell studies support that
classic modes of toxicity (i.e. hepatotoxicity) that rely on special transporters are not present in the lung but noted
changes in immune responses have been observed. This lack of knowledge of CB aerosols and their
mechanisms of action once inhaled are the basis for the research addressed in the current proposal. To address
these knowledge gaps, our innovative approach will utilize a environmental chamber to produce and characterize
atmospherically transformed aerosols of CB that will be applied directly to highly differentiated cultures of human
primary lung cell cultures grown on an air-liquid interface supports. We will also perform novel mechanistic
investigations by probing the ability of HAB-exposed lung cells to modulate critical immune cells (dendritic cells)
through the production of extracellular vesicles. We will test the overall hypothesis that transformed aerosols
of CB that produce the greatest extracellular ROS will trigger robust ROS and immune cellular responses
evidenced by changes in epithelial cell genes, ROS production and secretion of EVs. Furthermore these
EVs will modulate dendritic cells by altering their transcriptome and pushing them to a maturation state.
To test this hypothesis we propose two specific aims: (1) characterization of fresh and aged algal aerosols and
toxins, and (2) evaluate toxicity of aged algal aerosols and toxins to highly differentiated human lung epithelial
cells and test whether released EVs alter the maturation and transcriptional profiles of dendritic cells. This work
is both significant and innovative as successful completion will generate first-time toxicity profiles for airborne
HABs in cell models that more closely mimic in vivo airways. In addition, data produced will provide a unique
view on newly identified mechanisms of action of CB in the lung which support inhalation and pulmonary health
as a risk for exposed populations."
10948394,"Project Summary / Abstract Many patient advocacy groups are working to improve care and outcomes within
their specific context and there is great variability in their methods to achieve common goals. Implementation
science (IS) studies methods and strategies to facilitate the uptake of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) into
use by practitioners and policymakers and seeks to synthesize what works for whom and in what contexts and
to close the gap between research and practice. We hypothesize that IS approaches will facilitate patient
advocacy group-led research to increase implementation of EBIs and improve patient outcomes. A barrier to
this approach is lack of implementation research skills among those involved. I am a Professor of Surgery at the
University of Texas Health Science at Houston and have over 23 years’ experience conducting federally funded
multicenter comparative effectiveness randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The impact of RCTs on clinical practice
is often unknown (due to lack of treatment pattern data) but is likely less than desired by all stakeholders. IS
may increase the impact of research findings on clinical practice, achieving improved patient outcomes. I am
seeking AHRQ K18 funding to acquire new skills in IS and research methods, including knowledge about the
rational selection of theories and frameworks to address specific research questions, mixed-methods, and
qualitative research methodology, and in PCOR and CER methods outside of RCTs. Team science principles will
be part of the training program given the large multidisciplinary teams in patient advocacy group-led research.
Our proposed research projects involve patient-advocacy groups and IS teams as equal collaborators to increase
implementation of EBIs within different contexts. We believe that an IS approach will facilitate advocacy group-
led research efforts and investigating the effectiveness of these efforts (implementation and clinical outcomes)
will increase our understanding of what approach works for various advocacy groups and in what contexts.
Our Aims are to 1) develop and test strategies to increase implementation of consensus treatment plans for
juvenile idiopathic arthritis in collaboration with the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance,
2) investigate implementation considerations in the multiple sclerosis (MS) implementation network and patient
registry in collaboration with the MS Association of America, and 3) address gaps in knowledge that limit the
use of EBIs in the surgical treatment of infants with necrotizing enterocolitis in collaboration with the NEC
Society. The intensive training program will enhance my knowledge and experience in PCOR, CER,
implementation science, and team science. I will apply these new skills in the proposed research projects and in
future clinical trials, teach IS methods within clinical contexts, mentor faculty in these methods, and collaborate
with other investigators to apply implementation research considerations to their projects."
10948526,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We propose to use the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations as a framework to examine the
feasibility and acceptability of a community-based drug checking (CBDC) program operating through a
syringe service program (SSP) to collect information about the presence of xylazine in the illicit drug supply
among rural and tribal communities in Minnesota. Administrative datasets that detect xylazine are too
delayed and removed from persons who use drugs to provide actionable understanding into intervention
strategies or changes in use patterns. CBDC has the potential to identify emerging substances like xylazine
in real time and serve as point of care to provide individuals with information about their drugs, with
actionable responses and referrals to treatment and services. However, there is limited information on the
feasibility and acceptability of CBDC programs in the research literature and nothing in rural settings or with
tribal communities. The proposed R21, Community Mitigation Against Xylazine, will address this and is
ideally situated for the NOT-DA-24-012.
Minnesota legalized all drug paraphernalia in 2023, and the state provided funding to SSPs to purchase a
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy technology (the gold standard for CBDC programs), xylazine testing
strips, and wound care kits. As part of this exploratory R21, we build on a collaboration with a community-
based non-profit SSP that established the first mobile community-based drug checking in the state, with a
delivery area classified as rural and that includes two American Indian/Native American tribal reservations.
As part of a 24-month mixed-methods study, we will examine feasibility and acceptability of the CBDC
program to detect xylazine through data collected from program participants and staff, with those whose
drugs test positive for xylazine recruited to complete a qualitative interview on use and health effects. To
demonstrate feasibility, we will calculate the prevalence of xylazine among samples tested from a
centralized database that the investigation team will develop and disseminate to local stakeholders.
The proposed study has strong public health potential to mitigate harms from xylazine and future cutting
agents. Our study proposes examining drug checking where legal barriers have been removed and with a
highly understudied population. The investigation team has experience examining harm reduction strategies
and future R01 implementation science grants will use the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations to
examine strategies that improve the reach and benefits of this emerging harm reduction strategy."

Over the last decade, high-throughput B cell and T cell receptor repertoire sequencing has become a
fundamental method for investigating adaptive immune responses. The Immcantation framework, consisting of
open-source Python and R packages, provides a comprehensive analytical ecosystem for this Adaptive Immune
Receptor Repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) data analysis, covering critical steps like pre-processing, clonal
relationship identification, lineage reconstruction, and somatic hypermutation analysis. This framework has
gained widespread usage in infectious and immune-mediated disease research, with over 100,000 downloads
in 2022. However, as sequencing technologies advance and datasets grow larger, there is a need for scalable
computational workflows combining the individual analysis steps. To meet this demand and support the
expanding user and developer community, we developed nf-core/airrflow (AIRRflow), a Nextflow workflow that
integrates the individual Immcantation tools into a high-throughput analysis pipeline. The workflow offers
parallelization, scalability, and compatibility with diverse computing infrastructures, including High-Performance
Computing (HPC) clusters and commercial clouds. It is part of the nf-core project, a community-driven effort
collecting Nextflow pipelines with an emphasis on robustness and reproducibility. This proposal aims to enhance
AIRRflow usability, findability, accessibility, interoperability and scalability to cater to a broader audience in the
infectious and immune-mediated disease (IID) research community. The proposed aims include adding new
functionality to handle the integration of data from large numbers of subjects and facilitate interpretability,
including embedding methods that translate receptor sequences to length-independent numerical vectors
suitable for machine learning, determination of convergent responses across infectious and immune-mediated
diseases, and annotation of receptor specificity leveraging public databases like IEDB. To enhance accessibility
of data from public databases and ensure compliance with FAIR software principles, we will include automated
data download from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and ImmPort, expand the supported data types to
RNAseq and single-cell RNAseq, implement scalability tests, and make the workflow metadata accessible
through suitable portals like the NIAID Data Ecosystem Discovery Portal. We will actively work towards
expanding the user base by offering hands-on trainings, tutorials targeting relevant use cases for the IID research
community, and community engagement events, gathering feedback through multiple channels including
surveys, GitHub issue tracking and slack. These improvements will make AIRRflow an even more valuable
resource for researchers in the IID community."

 Craniofacial abnormalities are among the most common birth defects, affecting more than one in every
seven hundred live births worldwide. Recent studies found that mutations in CTNND1 are amongst the most
common monogenic causes of cleft lip. Ctnnd1 encodes p120-catenin (p120ctn), a protein best known to
maintain adherens junctions, but which has multiple molecular functions that are important in tissue
morphogenesis. A powerful gene-editing approach in mice was used to create Ctnnd1 mutant alleles that
individually disrupt distinct p120ctn protein functions, providing preliminary data that revealed the importance of
p120ctn-cadherin interactions and the dispensability of E-cadherin in lip development, presenting a paradox.
This proposal leverages newly developed mouse alleles and novel live imaging approaches to elucidate
molecular mechanisms underlying cleft lip in Ctnnd1 mutants. These approaches reveal striking actomyosin
dynamics during lip fusion and suggest a model in which p120ctn functions to fulfil a spatiotemporally specific
demand to withstand high actomyosin-generated forces and transduce mechanical signals. New mouse alleles,
live imaging approaches, and force manipulations will be leveraged to understand how p120ctn regulates the
cellular behaviors and cellular-generated forces that drive lip fusion.
 The project and training plan outlined in this proposal will lay the groundwork for Dr. Teng’s independent
research program at the intersection of craniofacial biology and cell biology. During this mentored period, she
will train in new techniques with major focus on quantitative image analysis, work closely with her advisory team,
and enroll in complementary coursework to acquire the necessary expertise to accomplish her research and
career goals. She will also undertake a program of training to support her professional development as a mentor
and supervisor. In addition to the experienced community of craniofacial biologists, UCSF also boasts a
dedicated program for the training of postdoctoral scholars. The training described in this proposal will equip Dr.
Teng with the necessary skill set and robust research platform to launch her independent research career."

Satiation is an important aspect of interoception that translates gut signals, such as cholecystokinin (CCK), into
eating suppression. Insatiable appetite is associated with developmental genetic diseases including Prader-Willi
Syndrome (PWS) and Shafer-Young Syndrome (SYS). Paradoxically, individuals with PWS have higher levels
of plasma CCK but consume more food, suggesting that the neural mechanism responsible for detecting
satiation signals is impaired and cannot convert satiation information into eating suppression. However, how the
neural circuit that regulates satiation is impaired in these diseases is still unknown. PWS and SYS share a
common mutation in the Magel2 gene, suggesting that the mutation of this gene might impair the satiation circuit.
Consistent with this, our preliminary results indicate that CCK fails to suppress food intake in Magel2-null mice.
Our previous studies have identified a specific population of neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA)
marked by the expression of protein kinase C-delta, which plays a critical role in detecting CCK. Silencing these
neurons prevents the eating suppression caused by CCK and activation of these neurons suppresses food intake.
Here, we found that the response of CeA PKC-δ neurons to CCK is reduced in Magel2 null mice. Therefore, we
hypothesize that the neural circuits involving CeA PKC-δ neurons are impaired after Magel2 mutation. In this
proposal, we aim to determine how the CeA PKC-δ neurons are affected by the Magel2 mutation, using recently
developed in vivo calcium imaging and electrophysiology approaches (Aim 1). Because the total number of CeA
PKC-δ neurons is not affected by Magel2-mutation, we will also test the hypothesis that activation of CeA PKC-
δ neurons suppresses appetite in Magel2-null mice (Aim 2). Successful completion of the proposed studies will
help us understand how satiation and appetite are regulated in the brains of individuals with PWS and SYS.
Additionally, it may suggest novel druggable targets in the brain to control insatiable appetite and obesity in these
diseases, ultimately improving the quality of life."

 Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of a wide range of bacterial infections globally and the most
common bacterial cause of mortality in the United States. These poor outcomes are driven by the high rates of
antibiotic treatment failure (15-40%) seen with many types of S. aureus infections including osteomyelitis,
prosthetic joint infections, and endocarditis. Antibiotic tolerance, which is defined as the ability of bacteria to
survive in the face of antibiotics through phenotypic changes without the acquisition of antibiotic resistance, is
the major driver of antibiotic treatment failure in S. aureus infections. Even with appropriate antibiotic therapy,
mortality rates can exceed 20% for some of these infections. Given the high incidence and the frequent treatment
failure, new and improved treatment options are needed to combat S. aureus infections.
 Despite the clinical significance of antibiotic tolerance, the mechanisms by which it occurs are poorly
understood. To gain new understanding of treatment failure in S. aureus infections, my fellowship research
focused on understanding antibiotic tolerance by conducting comprehensive, unbiased genetic and proteomic
screens of S. aureus during antibiotic exposure. With this approach, I identified a previously unknown relationship
between antibiotic tolerance and arginine metabolism where antibiotic tolerance in mature S. aureus
communities increases when arginine is depleted. In addition to being an essential amino acid for S. aureus
growth, arginine is also required for the production of nitric oxide by host immune cells such as neutrophils and
macrophages. Nitric oxide production is important for the host response to S. aureus infections, which
establishes arginine as an important contributor to the ability of the immune system to combat S. aureus.
Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that S. aureus influences arginine levels during infection by
carefully regulating arginine metabolism as a means to survive both in the face of antibiotics and the innate
immune response. Through this proposal, I plan to test this hypothesis by (1) elucidating the mechanism(s) by
which arginine metabolism influences antibiotic tolerance in S. aureus, (2) determining the role of S. aureus
arginine metabolism in persistence in the presence of innate immune effector cells, and (3) identifying the
contribution of S. aureus arginine metabolism to persistence and antibiotic treatment failure during infection.
Together, these experiments will better define the role of an essential amino acid at the host-pathogen interface.
The work in this proposal has the potential to uncover new therapeutics targets for the treatment of recalcitrant
infections that fail conventional therapies. In addition, through this award, I will receive important mentorship
while gaining specific research skills in animal models, eukaryotic cell culture, and imaging mass spectrometry.
This NIH K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award will help me establish my own
independent research program as part of my long-term goal of becoming a physician-scientist leader in the field
of infectious diseases with an expertise in bacterial pathogenesis and antibiotic treatment failure."
10949962,"ABSTRACT
Cervical spine abnormalities in mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) may result in cervical spinal cord (CSC)
compression and irreversible neurological disability. MRI signal intensity changes in CSC images occur in the
presence of advanced stenosis, myelopathy, and developed clinical symptoms. The proposal presumes that
deficits in CSC morphology and microstructure precede MRI signal changes and are predictive of clinical
myelopathy. We will proceed with systematic validation comparing CSC morphology and microstructure in MPS
patients and case-matched healthy controls. The overall objective is to analyze existing and acquired CSC MRI
data and assess longitudinal CSC morphology and cross-sectional CSC microstructure in the MPS. The central
hypothesis is that quantitative MRI is sensitive to CSC morphological and microstructural degeneration,
myelopathy risk, and disease severity in MPS. To test the central hypothesis and, thereby, attain the overall
objective, we will pursue two specific aims: Aim 1: Assess longitudinal morphological damage of CSC in MPS
types I, II, and VI and Aim 2: Assess cross-sectional microstructural damage of CSC in MPS types I and VI. Aim
1 will test a working hypothesis that CSC morphology is altered due to cervical spinal compression and is
predictive of myelopathy in MPS. Aim 2 will test a working hypothesis that CSC inner integrity is altered due to
MPS I and VI diseases. We will demonstrate that quantitative CSC MRI measurements are proportional to
myelopathy risk and disease severity in MPS. The effects of MPS treatment on CSC measurements will be
investigated where possible. The proposal will identify candidates for biomarkers of myelopathy in MPS.
Regarding the biomarker research, the proposal is a pilot preclinical exploratory phase 1. The project is
innovative because it will: (i) discover the biomarker candidates of myelopathy risk and disease severity in MPS;
(ii) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) will be assessed in the CSC of MPS patients; (iii) demonstrate that DTI-based
CSC microstructure can assess ongoing degenerative processes before visual and qualitative MRI signal
intensity changes. Overall, the proposal aims to advance objective early myelopathy diagnosis, which can guide
the timing of a prophylactic myelopathy treatment and improve clinical outcomes in MPS."

Abstract
Arkansas Children’s Research Institute (ACRI), Arkansas Children’s Nutrition Center (ACNC), University of
Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS), and University of Arkansas at Fayetteville (UAF) are building an
innovative Women’s Precision Health Platform for establishing relationships between dietary intake, medical
history, metabolome, microbiome, and women’s health outcomes. The program will leverage past, present and
future research studies of mother and child health at the USDA-ARS funded ACNC and clinical research
programs within ACRI and UAMS, integrating data from studies capturing rich phenotypic data, including
metabolomics, microbiome, genomics and proteomics. This initiative focuses on developing a shared data
infrastructure between UAMS, ACRI and UAF using models established for the IDeA National Resource for
Quantitative Proteomics. The -Infrastructure will support women’s precision nutrition and health research. This
will involve development of a research database, software, and sustainable cloud-based infrastructure to
facilitate machine learning and AI data analytics for metabolomics, genomics, proteomics, microbiome, clinical
biochemical, and patient personal phenotypic data. We will develop a data visualization dashboard to support
monitoring, measuring, analyzing, and visualizing multi-omics data, as well as integrate classic multivariate
statistical methods, time-series data analysis methods, and deep learning-based integration and learning
models. Finally, we will develop workshops and training materials to provide students cross-training in medical
applications database development and informatics research tools. Ultimately this database and research tools
will support fundamental research in the understanding of how critical dietary and lifestyle factors influence
health and disease in women."
10950139,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Neurodevelopmental impairment remains the most vexing issue facing the clinical management of premature
infants. Intrauterine infection and inflammation are significant causes of preterm birth potentially resulting in
lifelong neurodevelopmental impairment, such as cerebral palsy, sensory and cognitive deficits and behavioral
difficulties. Ureaplasma parvum is a bacterial species that is a common cause of preterm labor induced by
intrauterine infection. Antibiotic treatment (Azithromycin) of intrauterine infection by Ureaplasma has been shown
to delay preterm labor and improve fetal lung and fetal hemodynamic outcomes in non-human primates (NHP),
which are the most clinically relevant animal model in which to study human preterm labor and fetal brain injury.
However, mechanisms of neuroinflammation and perinatal brain injury, and the action of antibiotics on the fetal
brain in relation to intrauterine infection remain poorly understood. Microglial polarization into pro- or anti-
inflammatory phenotypes is a mechanism by which systemic inflammation may cause neuroinflammation in the
developing brain. In the current proposal, we aim to investigate whether intrauterine infection by Ureaplasma
parvum results in perinatal brain microglial polarization, oligodendrocyte maturation arrest and white matter
injury. We will utilize our access to brain samples from a unique Fetal and Postnatal Non-Human Primate (NHP)
Tissue Repository collected from preterm birth studies previously conducted in our cohort of pregnant rhesus
macaques at ONPRC. Our NHP model of intrauterine UP infection represents a valuable opportunity and
clinically relevant model system in which to investigate the mechanisms of perinatal neuroinflammation
associated with infection-induced preterm labor across fetal and early postnatal development. In Aim 1 we will
assess microglial polarization in response to intrauterine infection and inflammation and maternal antibiotic
treatment in the fetal and postnatal preterm brain. Aim 2 will investigate mechanisms of oligodendrocyte
progenitor cell maturation and myelination associated with intrauterine Ureaplasma infection. This proposal
utilizes our team's extensive experience in studying pregnancy physiology and fetal neurodevelopment and uses
novel spatial transcriptomic techniques in our unique NHP model of prematurity. Successful completion of this
study, utilizing available stored NHP fetal and postnatal brain samples, will provide essential data on the
mechanisms of fetal neuroinflammation that will contribute to future preclinical studies of the treatment of preterm
labor and perinatal brain injury."
10950187,"Neurodevelopmental disorders often have clear genetic components but linking genotype to phenotype remains
challenging. Recent advances in genome editing technology have enabled the rapid generation of animal models
for cognitive genetic disorders. However, the differing methodologies used across laboratories to phenotype
these models confounds efforts to make predictive links between cellular functions of the brain and behavioral
outcomes. I propose harnessing Multiplex Intermixed CRISPR droplet (MIC-Drop) technologies to generate
knockouts of all 61 transcriptional regulators present in zebrafish larvae that are associated with human cognitive
disorders. I will characterize these mutants at the molecular and cellular level with a multiplexed single-cell RNA
sequencing technique I have developed, termed MIC-Drop-seq, that allows the simultaneous characterization of
many transcriptomes from hundreds of mutant embryos in a single experiment. I will characterize these mutants
at the brain morphology and behavioral levels with a battery of high throughput quantitative microscopy assays.
I will use these large-scale quantitative datasets to construct new predictive machine learning models that will
uncover the links between genetics, molecular features, brain morphology, and behavioral outcomes in brain
development. These models may yield new treatment strategies for many human cognitive disorders. To achieve
the goals of my proposal, I will embark on an intensive training plan with my mentorship team that will enable
me to transition from my previous background in experimental biology to become a leader in the field of functional

10950081,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tuberculosis (TB) and common mental disorders (CMDs) are both leading causes of death and disability
worldwide and are intertwined health states that often co-occur but are rarely addressed together. People with
TB and diagnosis of at least one CMD have double the risk of loss to follow-up, treatment failure, or death
along with increased odds of non-adherence to TB treatment. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify and
assess evidence-based interventions to address CMDs as part of routine TB care to improve wellbeing and TB
treatment outcomes among people with TB.
The overall objective of this application is to identify and adapt an intervention to address CMDs among people
being treated for TB. The central hypothesis is that an existing mental health intervention for CMDs is
appropriate for and can be adapted and integrated into routine TB care. The central hypothesis will be tested
by pursing three specific aims: 1) examine the relationship between CMDs and associated factors with TB
treatment adherence and treatment outcomes during the TB treatment period to identify the most critical timing
and type of intervention needed, 2) adapt and explore barriers and facilitators for implementation of an
evidence based CMD intervention for integration into routine TB treatment services, and 3) pilot an intervention
aimed at improving TB treatment outcomes among individuals with CMD symptoms. The results of this work
will provide critical preliminary data for an NIH R01 application evaluating effectiveness of the adapted
intervention among people with TB on treatment.
Dr. West’s career goal is to become an independent investigator focused on improving TB treatment outcomes
in high-burden settings by addressing the mental health needs of people with TB. To support her path to
independence, the proposed work will be paired with a dedicated, multidisciplinary mentorship team and
training in longitudinal study design and conduct (Aim 1), implementation sciences (Aims 2 and 3), and
interventional research (Aim 3). UCSF is an outstanding environment that is committed to junior investigators
with extensive resources for research and career development. Thus, the K01 award will provide Dr. West with
the critical mentorship, training, resources and experience to become an international leader in mental health
research among people with TB."
10950144,"PROJECT SUMMARY
For head and neck cancer patients, a positive surgical margin results in treatment intensification, increased cost,
and an increased risk of recurrence and death. Positive surgical margin rates in oral cavity cancer are the highest
among solid malignancies and have not improved over the past two decades. If a positive margin is identified
intraoperatively, the surgeon relies on verbal descriptions during a phone call with the pathologist to relocate the
margin and resect additional tissue. Relocating the positive margin site using current protocols with no visual aid
is difficult in the head and neck due to complex 3D anatomy. Therefore, it is not surprising that re-resection fails
to improve oncologic outcomes. To address this unmet need, I have developed a protocol to create a virtual 3D
model of the resected cancer specimen that shows the sites of margin sampling. In a prior cadaveric study, I
established the feasibility of placing the 3D specimen model into an augmented reality (AR) environment to guide
re-resection. AR superimposes a computer-generated image on a user's view of the real world, thus providing a
composite view. The goal of this project is to determine the accuracy of placing a 3D specimen hologram into
the surgical defect in actual head and neck cancer patients and develop custom AR software to improve time
and accuracy of alignment. In Aim 1, I will determine the accuracy of alignment of the projected 3D specimen
model into the surgical defect. The tumor will be resected per standard of care, 3D scanned, and uploaded into
the AR environment. The surgeon will wear the Microsoft HoloLens 2, a portable, handsfree, AR headset. The
surgeon will align the 3D specimen hologram into the resection bed and accuracy will be measured. In Aim 2, I
will develop a custom AR surgery platform to improve time and accuracy of alignment. The existing AR software
has significant limitations for surgical use, including limited voice commands, inability to adjust transparency,
and lack of a lock-in-place feature. To address this, I am creating custom AR software in collaboration with the
Vanderbilt Institute for Surgery and Engineering. In a cadaveric study, surgeons will align the 3D specimen
hologram into the resection bed using both the custom and existing AR software. Time and accuracy of alignment
will be measured. During this project I will benefit from the guidance of my primary mentor, who is an established
surgeon-scientist with substantial experience in bringing new technologies into the operating room, as well as
three co-mentors with expertise in specific areas. Additionally, I will undertake advanced training in AR systems,
surgical pathology processing, and clinical trial design, which will provide a strong foundation for pursuing my
career goal of becoming a surgeon-scientist focused on implementation of AR systems to improve the
effectiveness of oncologic surgery. This project will lay the groundwork for a future R01 application to include
expansion of AR technology to other solid malignancies and a prospective clinical trial to determine whether use
of 3D scanning and AR-guided oncologic surgery improves positive margin rates and ultimately patient
outcomes."
10950147,"ABSTRACT. Dental care utilization is a critical component of oral health and overall health over the lifespan.
However, nearly 2 in 5 American adults have not had a dental care visit in the past year. Interpersonal
violence—including firearm violence—is a serious public health issue in the United States that impacts millions
of Americans' lives and directly impacts health and the utilization of health care services. While prior research
finds that specific forms of violence exposure, including certain adverse childhood experiences and intimate
partner violence, are associated with lower dental care utilization and greater unmet dental needs, there is
limited research on the role of exposure to community violence and dental care utilization. Moreover, research
on violence and dental care is limited by exclusively using cross-sectional data and, therefore, cannot observe
patterns of violence and dental care utilization over time and throughout life course stages. The proposed
study fills these gaps and provides the first comprehensive investigation into the relationship between violence
exposure and dental care utilization from multiple perspectives, including individual experiences with violence,
vicarious community violence exposure, and ecological research on community firearm violence and dental
care utilization rates. We use three rich longitudinal data sources that measure violence and dental care
utilization in the United States: (1) the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health; N
= 7,295)—an ongoing, nationally representative longitudinal study of persons in the United States followed
over 25 years (ages 12-44) which includes data on violent victimization, and dental care utilization, (2) the
Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS; N = 3,000)—an ongoing longitudinal study of children
born in large US cities (population over 200,000) followed from birth to age 22, which includes comprehensive
measures of vicarious community violence exposure and dental care, and (3) the Neighborhood Gun Violence
and Health in 100 Cities (NGVH-100; N = 15,882)—a novel dataset from 15,882 urban census tracts in the
United States from 2014-2021 measuring every incident of fatal and nonfatal firearm shootings and rates of
dental care utilization. This study has three aims. Aim 1 will use the Add Health data to determine the
relationship between personal violent victimization and dental care utilization from adolescence to adulthood
(ages 12-44), including variations by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES). Aim 2 will use the
FFCWS data to determine the relationship between vicarious community violence exposure and dental care
utilization from childhood to emerging adulthood (ages 5-22), including race/ethnicity and SES variations. Aim
3 will use the NGVH-100 data to determine the relationship between exposure to fatal and nonfatal firearm
violence and dental care utilization rates in urban census tracts, including race/ethnicity and SES variations.
The findings from this study can facilitate novel translational research and inform the development of violence
reduction interventions in real-world dental care settings."

The skin represents the first and outermost body’s line of defense, continuously dealing with potentially harmful
environmental and physical stressors. To protect internal tissues, skin epithelial stem cells (SC) must exert
diverse functions and form a barrier by proliferating, differentiating, secreting lipids and anti-microbial molecules.
To allow for such a diverse functional output and specialization, SC rely on a high degree of heterogeneity within
the skin. While this is mostly dictated at a developmental and anatomical level (such as the differences between
the interfollicular and the hair follicle compartments), a considerable level of heterogeneity persists within the
same compartment, as observed by recent single-cell RNA sequencing and clonal proliferation studies. However,
how is this heterogeneity distributed across the tissue and what drives it remains unexplored. More importantly,
what is the advantage and the consequence of establishing SC heterogeneity across the tissue remains an open
question.
In my preliminary studies, I observed that immune cells (and more specifically dendritic epidermal T cells, or
DETC) in the skin fine tune and tailor their effector functions depending on the stem cells they are directly
contacting (i.e. hair follicle of interfollicular epidermal SC). These findings provide a proof of concept that
functional heterogeneity might arise from immune-SC crosstalk in the tissue. Therefore, here I plan to investigate
whether the immune niche can drive SC heterogeneity within one SC unit (using the hair follicle as a model) and
among distinct units across the tissue. More in detail, I aim to decipher: 1) how direct contact with DETC (which
are uniformly distributed in every upper hair follicle) mediates functional SC specification within the hair follicle
(Aim I); and 2) how proximity to lymphoid clusters (which are sparsely distributed across the skin and resemble
tertiary lymphoid structures) dictates spatial and functional SC heterogeneity among different hair follicles across
the tissue (Aim II).
The results generated in this proposal will: 1) shed a new light in our understanding of SC-immune crosstalk in
the skin and provide a novel perspective on the role of the immune system in the tissue and of SC heterogeneity;
2) allow to decode new molecular laws governing tissue homeostasis, which will be critical to comprehend what
goes awry during disease; 3) establish a new paradigm and generate a toolkit to study cellular crosstalk within
tissue microenvironments.
Under the supervision of the world-renowned expert in stem cell biology, Dr. Elaine Fuchs, the co-mentorship of
a leading immunologist and pioneer in genetic tools development for the study of cellular interaction, Dr. Gabriel
Victora, I am ideally positioned to develop my technical skills, knowledge, and training. With my research
background, training and career development, I will be able to establish a unique niche at the intersection of
immunology and stem cell biology as an independent investigator."
10946265,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Temporal Interference (TI) is an innovative non-invasive brain stimulation technique that holds great promise. It
utilizes high-frequency electrical currents (e.g., 1000 Hz and 1000 + Δf Hz) to achieve deep and precise brain
stimulation. TI is characterized by the simultaneous application of two high-frequency electrical signals, each
with a specific offset frequency (referred to as Δf). This combination results in the creation of an amplitude
modulation (AM), at depth, considered to be the stimulating signal within the targeted brain structure. However,
despite its theoretical potential and successful application in the peripheral nervous system, there are significant
gaps in our understanding of how TI truly functions within the central nervous system (CNS). To bridge this
knowledge gap, this three-year research project is structured around three specific aims. Aim 1 delves into the
spatial precision, focality, and depth of TI stimulation. We will examine the correlation between the size of AM
and its impact on neuronal activation using real-time calcium level monitoring in brain slices, finite element
simulations, recording in anesthetized mice and expression of immediate early genes (IEGs - i.e., c-fos, c-jun,
arc). Aim 2 explores the frequency of AM (Δf) generated by TI and its potential interaction with carrier
frequencies. We will use genetically encoded voltage indicators to study cellular dynamics (cell type specific
response to TI stimulation i.e., glutamatergic, GABAergic) in brain slices on a microelectrode array. We will also
examine the impact of varying Δf in vivo with the co-localization of neuronal subtype (glutamatergic vs GABAergic
cells) and IEGs. Aim 3 investigates the differential effects of TI on neurons and fibers within the CNS. We will
grow primary neurons in microfluidic chambers to physically separate cell bodies from axons and compare soma
versus axon targeted by TI in vitro. Additionally, by varying the orientation of electrode pairs in vivo, we will also
compare direct TI stimulation of specific nuclei (i.e., septum and hippocampus) versus stimulation of the
pathways (i.e., septo-hippocampal and perforant). Finally, we will combine TI with reversible chemogenetic
neuromodulation to reveal if TI stimulation is enhanced when targeting the pathways projecting to the specific
target structure, as opposed to directly stimulating the target itself. Through this multifaceted research, we aim
to bridge the gap between TI's theoretical promise and its practical applications, ultimately advancing our
understanding of non-invasive neuromodulation and its potential clinical implications."
10947201,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The incidence of early onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) has increased in the past four decades and is
predicted to increase by 140% by 2030.4,5 It is the second most common cancer and third leading cause of
cancer deaths in individuals under 50 years old in the USA.4,6,7 In a recent review47, we proposed that increased
risk of EOCRC is driven by exposomes whose entry into the global environment precedes and mimics the
worldwide increase in EOCRC incidence. Exposure to these suspected exposomes has been increasing in the
past 40 years (as has EOCRC), and they all impact guardians of the colon (inflammation, the microbiome, and
epigenetic/genetic changes); exposure is global and occurs during development – potentially during childhood.
In this project, we focus on the role of exposure to antibiotics during development and its on impact EOCRC in
appropriate pre-clinical models. Antibiotic overuse has become a serious public health concern, with over a
million doses prescribed annually in the US.50,23 Its use in infants is high; over 50% are directly exposed for >5
days.17 Indirect exposure in pregnancy affects infant gut microbiota at birth19,20; and at an early age, exposure
can lead to multiple health disorders - including CRC.21,22,23 Repeated exposures contribute to antibiotic
resistance and altered gut microbiota with pro-inflammatory and pro-carcinogenic outcomes28-32, suggesting that
there may be windows of developmental vulnerability. However, epidemiologic and animal studies have shown
conflicting results, with none conducted on the impact of antibiotics commonly prescribed to infants and children
on the colon, creating a substantial gap in our knowledge on the mechanisms by which antibiotics impact
EOCRC. We will address this gap by testing the hypothesis that exposure early in life to antibiotics commonly
prescribed to children causes a toxic colon (associated with dysbiosis, inflammation, and altered genetic
signatures) that promote mutations leading to EOCRC. Using mouse models of CRC, we will test this hypothesis
in two specific aims: Aim 1. To identify developmental windows of susceptibility to antibiotics; Aim 2. To
determine if dysbiosis caused by antibiotics drives EOCRC. Upon completion, we will know: (1) the impact of
antibiotics on EOCRC risk; (2) developmental windows of colon susceptibility to antibiotics; (3) what microbes
drive EOCRC; and (4) whether these microorganisms promote increased mutation as a mechanism causing
CRC. The acquired knowledge will be critical in developing novel strategies to identify individuals at risk,
interventions to minimize risk of EOCRC, and informed decisions to mitigate risk after use of antibiotics that are
indispensable against infections, and more importantly, provide the foundation for future studies to identify
components of human microbiome that mediate increased risk for EOCRC."

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy. The disease incidence peaks
in children younger than five, declining until the mid-20s and increasing after age 50. Despite advances in treating
pediatric patients, at least one out of five children relapse and die of leukemia. T-cell ALL (T-ALL) presents a
higher risk for relapse than the B-cell ALL subtype, and relapse disease is a significant cause of cancer-related
deaths in children. Children with leukemia exhibiting an increased risk of treatment failure and relapse
desperately need an alternative therapy to induce durable remission. However, developing alternative treatments
requires identifying actionable pro-leukemic pathways in leukemic cells, particularly in drug-resistant leukemic
cells able to reinitiate disease and cause relapse. We are well-positioned to fulfill this medical need because we
recently identified aberrant activation of the kinase MAP2K7 in bulk T-ALL leukemic cells and the leukemia-
initiating cell (LIC) population involved in refractory and relapsed disease. In the absence of potent and specific
inhibitors of MAP2K7, we showed as a proof of concept that leukemic cells are vulnerable to pharmacological
JNK inhibition, the sole downstream target; however, low potency and off-target toxicity prevent translating JNK
inhibitors to the clinics. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that direct targeting with novel MAP2K7
inhibitors can increase treatment response by eradicating chemoresistant leukemic cells. In this application, we
propose developing targeted inhibition of the aberrantly activated MAP2K7 pathway through the screen of
MAP2K7 protein binders using DNA-encoded chemical libraries (Aim 1) and studying kinase inhibitory activity
and efficacy of identified inhibitors in pre-clinical mouse models to accelerate clinical translation in T-ALL patients
(Aim 2). To achieve this goal, we assembled a collaborative team composed of a research scientist with expertise
in genetic and xenograft mouse models to study T-ALL, a physician-scientist involved in clinical trials at the
Texas Children's Hospital, and a medicinal chemist at the Center for Drug Discovery at Baylor College of
Medicine. The proposed study can result in new therapies to target a novel target to treat pediatric patients with
high-risk leukemia."
10946397,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A central question in reproductive immunology is how the fetus and placenta avoid being rejected by the
maternal immune system. Despite the substantial progress made on this question in recent years, many key
knowledge gaps remain. These gaps not only prevent us from leveraging underlying mechanisms to induce
antigen-specific immune tolerance in the clinical arena, but also limit investigation into the pathogenesis of
intrauterine growth restriction, spontaneous abortion, preeclampsia, and preterm labor, i.e., pregnancy
complications that may all involve aberrant activation of the maternal immune system to placental antigens.
Recently, our laboratory has described key roles for B cell-mediated antigen presentation and antigen
glycosylation in suppressing immune responses to placental antigens in mice. Specifically, we found that a
surrogate model antigen expressed by trophoblasts (t-mOVA) is presented to maternal CD4 T cells exclusively
by antigen-specific B cells, and that these B cells are suppressed through the actions of t-mOVA’s heavily
sialylated N-linked glycans, thus in turn suppressing the CD4 T cells. This major new line of investigation raises
immediate questions that we address in this proposal. Specifically, Aim 1 will use both mouse (t-mOVA) and
human models to evaluate the hypothesis that glycan-specific IgM natural antibodies bind to antigens shed
from the placenta, activating complement and thus causing the antigens to accumulate on follicular dendritic
cells in the spleen. This accumulation in turn allows the antigens’ glycans to suppress antigen-specific B cells.
Substantiation of this pathway would suggest new ways to conceptualize the pathogenesis of human
pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia that are linked to increased antibody and complement
deposition on trophoblast membranes. Aim 2 then seeks to the determine the features of trophoblast glycans
that impart them with immunosuppressive properties, which, together with Aim 1, would inform how best to
harness trophoblast glycobiology for therapeutic purposes. It will employ a variety of techniques including mass
spectrometry to define the structures of t-mOVA’s glycans, and will fingerprint the glycans that decorate human
syncytiotrophoblast brush border membrane proteins bathed in maternal blood. Lastly, Aim 3 will address the
behavior of the tissue resident memory T cells that populate the decidua. These cells are positioned to defend
against congenital infection but also pose potential direct threats to fetal survival. Using mouse models, it will
determine the responsiveness of the cells to trophoblast antigens, as well as whether they are suppressed by
trophoblast antigen-associated glycans, like B and T cells are systemically. Together, we expect this work to
have a major impact on the field as it begins to connect the discovery that glycans play a central role in
fetomaternal tolerance with other critical questions in reproductive immunology and obstetrics. The work will
also further a second long-term goal of the fetomaternal tolerance field, namely, to foster application of
underlying mechanisms to immune tolerance induction in the clinical arena."
10946400,"The goal of this proposal is to fully delineate the molecular mechanisms by which the prominent serine/threonine
Protein Phosphatase 2 (PP2A) holoenzyme, specifically PP2A/B55α, recognizes its substrates through a new
helical motif and to use this information to identify direct PP2A/B55α substrates with functions in mitogenic
signaling and early cell cycle progression. Protein phosphorylation is an essential regulatory mechanism in cell
signaling and the regulation of the cell cycle and it is altered in cancer, Alzheimer, and other diseases. A large
fraction of dephosphorylation is mediated by distinct PP2A trimeric holoenzymes. These consist of a scaffold
protein that connects the catalytic subunit to the variable regulatory subunit, which mediates substrate specificity.
The most abundant holoenzyme is PP2A/B55α. Its activity has been implicated in mitogenic signaling and early
cell cycle progression, but details remain unclear. Initially, it was believed that PP2A/B55α recruited substrates
through charge-charge interactions between the surface of B55α and substrates. However, our groundbreaking
discoveries challenged this notion. We identified a conserved amino acid motif in various proteins, including the
p107 substrate and the FAM122A inhibitor, that folds as an a-helix. This helical motif is essential for p107
dephosphorylation and for FAM122A binding via similar interactions with residues in a groove on the top of B55α.
This mechanism is distinct from that used by other Ser/Thr phosphatases that bind short linear motifs in
intrinsically disordered protein regions. Gap: Despite this advance, we remain unable to identify other
PP2A/B55α substrates using this short helical sequence. This is due to the lack of a comprehensive assessment
of amino acid variability within the helical motif sequence and incomplete detail of the motif’s structural plasticity.
As a result, it remains extremely difficult to identify new substrates, to distinguish correctly vs incorrectly assigned
substrates, and to demonstrate the veracity of correctly assigned substrates. We hypothesize that a helical
region with a defined length and a variable conserved amino acid sequence in PP2A/B55α substrates mediates
binding to the top groove of B55α via specific electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. This is a primary
mechanism for substrate recognition that modulates signaling through the cell cycle. These will be tested with
two aims: (1) To define PP2A/B55α substrate specificity via a short helical motif with defined sequences. (2) To
dissect the PP2A/B55α substrate interplay in mitogenic signaling linked to the cell cycle Restriction Point (RP).
DEIA Aims: Diversity among Temple University undergraduates is excellent, but the transition of
underrepresented minority (URM) students to biomedical science research careers or graduate schools is still
severely limited. Our goal is to implement a program we have been piloting that is geared toward eliminating
barriers to joining the scientific research workforce faced by URM undergraduates at Temple and nationwide.
The program will recruit 15 students who will work in mentors’ labs on a specific project and receive programmatic
training to prepare them for admission and success in Biomedical Research PhD programs. Aim 1 is to develop
research skills and knowledge and Aim 2 is to develop career skills by providing instruction in fellowship writing,
graduate school application, oral and writing scientific communication, and scientific networking.
Successful completion of the scientific Aims will facilitate identification of PP2A/B55α substrates and their
validation in multiple pathways and cellular processes often deregulated in disease providing novel targets for
therapeutic intervention. The DEIA training program will guide URM students to professional research careers."

racial/ethnic groups. If current trends continue, it is estimated that 50% of Latine children and adolescents will
develop T2D in their lifetime. This is critical since the impact of early onset of T2D is extensive involving
premature morbidity, high healthcare costs and significant loss of productivity. Hence, interventions that
effectively reduce obesity risk and T2D among fastest growing group of Latine children are urgently needed.
Excess weight gain during infancy is associated with childhood obesity. Exclusive breastfeeding (directly or
expressed) for the first six months is associated with lower risk for excess weight gain and insulin insensitivity
during infancy. In our longitudinal sub-study with low-income, Latine mother-infant dyads, mixed feeding
(combination of breastfeeding and formula feeding) was more common than exclusive breastfeeding. It was
also found that obesity risk among infants increased with an increase in formula feeding.
Utilizing Social Cognitive Theory, our goal is to measure the effectiveness of a multi-component randomized
control trial - Solo Mi Leche (SMile) – involving:
 I) Provision of conditional incentives of cash or combination of cash and electric breast pump to enroll
 in WIC’s Exclusive Breastfeeding Package; and,
 II) Support of home visiting, culturally and linguistically competent breastfeeding peer-counselors to
 increase breastfeeding support, knowledge, skills and ultimately self-efficacy.
The intervention spanning from birth to six months postpartum will involve 120 Latine mothers eligible or
enrolled in WIC program (60 each in intervention & control). Specific aims are to test the effectiveness of SMile
intervention in: 1) improving self-efficacy and exclusivity of breastfeeding for the first six months, and; 2)
reducing rapid weight gain and obesity risk among Latine infants. We will also carry out a process evaluation to
understand strengths of the intervention and opportunities to improve its implementation, feasibility, fidelity,
and impact.
The proposed pilot trial (Small R01s, PAS-23-086) will allow us to acquire preliminary data through six months
of age to develop an effective, fully powered, culturally appropriate intervention promoting breastfeeding
throughout infancy, to address obesity, T2D and related disparities Latine population is facing."
10944661,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The relatively finite number of ~20,000 protein coding genes in the mammalian genome limits the overall diversity
that transcriptional regulation can achieve in a given biological context. This diversity can be enhanced by many
orders of magnitude by post-transcriptional regulation such as alternative splicing and modification and
degradation of mRNA, which in turn leads to a greater protein diversity and thus a greater functional complexity
of the cell. This seems particularly relevant in the context of complex processes such as cell specification and
organogenesis. The importance of RNA regulation is further supported by the large number RNA-binding
proteins encoded in the human genome (~1,500) and their ever more prominent emergence in the context of
disease. Despite the clear evidence of the relevance of RNA regulation, much less remains known compared to
the exceptionally well-researched gene regulatory mechanisms. This lack of progress is in part due to technical
challenges associated with studying and manipulating RNA, particularly during early development. However,
recent advancements in this area now afford new opportunities to broaden our knowledge in these critical
regulatory mechanisms and start to fill this critical knowledge gap. Here we will interrogate RNA-binding proteins
important for cardiac development, specifically the the X-linked protein DDX3X. Mutations in DDX3X lead to
DDX3X Syndrome, which is characterized by intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, congenital brain
malformations and motor problems. DDX3X has not been interrogated during cardiogenesis to date, but recent
studies have uncovered that individuals with DDX3X Syndrome frequently present with congenital heart disease.
Based on our preliminary findings we hypothesize that DDX3X acts in a spatio-temporal manner, by targeting
distinct regulatory networks during the development of the different cell types of the heart. We further hypothesize
that disease-causing mutations in DDX3X affect cellular dysfunction by specific mechanisms of DDX3X target
regulation. Aim 1 will uncover the direct, and functionally relevant targets of DDX3X. Aim 2 will determine the
cellular phenotype of DDX3X-deficient male and female embryos. Aim 3 will elucidate genotype-phenotype
correlations in DDX3X Syndrome patient-derived hPSC-CMs. Successful completion of the aims are expected
to identify and characterize the cellular requirements and in depth molecular mechanisms of DDX3X, a new
RNA-binding protein that we found to be essential for heart development. The overall and long-term goal is to
contribute to a better understanding of RNA regulatory mechanisms, specifically during cardiac development
and in the context of the formation of congenital heart disease."

Genomic data can provide an invaluable source of information to understand pathogen evolution, identify
patterns of transmission, and characterize phenotypes such as drug resistance and immune escape. For
eukaryotic pathogens, larger genomes, sexual recombination, and complicated transmission dynamics
including polyclonal infections have historically limited the use of genomic data for many of these applications.
However, recent laboratory developments, including multiplexed targeted sequencing, have rapidly increased
the pace of genomic data generation for eukaryotic pathogens. Fundamental differences in the biology and
transmission of infections caused by these pathogens render many of the genomic data and analysis tools
developed for other organisms (primarily humans, viruses, and bacteria) difficult or impossible to use. As a
result, many research efforts have needed to rely on bespoke methods for processing and analysis, limiting the
reusability of data, the accuracy and reproducibility of results, and more generally the productivity of scientists
studying eukaryotic pathogens. There is a need to develop software and computational tools to process, store,
share and analyze these data in a way which sets standards, encourages innovation, and facilities scientific
discovery. We will develop a suite of data standards and robust software including a) bioinformatic pipelines
including tools to facilitate the sharing and storage of these data, b) a modular software toolkit to conduct
downstream statistical analyses relevant for epidemiologic and population genetic research, and c) work within
a community of advisors and experts in the analysis of genomic data for eukaryotic pathogens to develop
approaches that meet the needs of community and encourage broader uptake. The proposed work also
includes harmonizing and developing standards for genomic, epidemiological, and clinical data. We will initially
focus on Plasmodium falciparum, a species of parasite that causes malaria infections, as an organism of direct
application which exhibits key complexities of eukaryotic pathogens (recombination, polyclonal infections). As
such, standards and software developed during this proposal will have relevance beyond this single organism
to other eukaryotic pathogens where similar biological and transmission complexities limit the use of existing
tools to leverage genomic data to answer scientific and public health relevant questions. The expected
outcome of the proposed research is computational software able to analyze targeted amplicon sequencing
data for eukaryotic pathogens. By developing these approaches, with clear engagement within the broader
research community, this work will help change the landscape of analyses possible with complex genomic
data."

 Peer-reviewed publications are essential for successful careers in biomedical research. The development
of strong writing skills is critical for early stage investigators because publishing in reputable scientific journals
significantly increases the likelihood that they will successfully navigate critical transition points in their careers,
pass third-year review, achieve tenure and promotion, and receive favorable scores on extramural grant
applications. Persistence is required to establish effective writing habits and strong writing skills, particularly
since revision is the essence of writing well. The absence of gold-standard interventions designed to assist
early-stage investigators in developing scientific writing skills is remarkable given that these skills are essential
for success in biomedical science. Early-stage investigators from groups underrepresented in biomedical
science tend to have fewer opportunities to develop robust writing skills aligned with research careers. Those
who transition to their first faculty positions without establishing writing skills and habits often have lower rates
of scholarly productivity which can negatively influence the impact scores on NIH grant applications.
 Writing for publication programs have become commonplace over the past two decades and many
attempt to facilitate writing productivity through writing groups or writing courses Writing accountability groups
(WAGs) are semi-structured, peer-led writing groups with a core group of participants that meet weekly over
10-weeks to develop a daily practice of writing scientific manuscripts. Structured writing courses emphasize
writing skills improvement and train participants how to write a scientific manuscript from start to finish. Both
approaches have been successful in increasing scientific manuscript productivity, however none have been
evaluated in appropriately powered, theoretically driven, randomized trials. To our knowledge only two studies
exclusively focused on early-stage investigators from groups underrepresented in biomedical science. The
objective of the proposed Write from the Start study is to assess the outcomes, benefits, burdens, and
participant satisfaction of a 6-month randomized controlled trial (RCT) on manuscript writing productivity.
Early-stage investigators from backgrounds underrepresented in biomedical science (n=120) will be randomly
assigned to 1) an enhanced, virtual peer-led WAG + a virtual, manuscript writing course or 2) the virtual
manuscript writing course alone. The number of scientific articles published 24-months will be the primary
endpoint. We will test the central hypothesis that assignment to the virtual, enhanced, peer-led WAG + virtual
writing course compared to the virtual writing course alone will have favorable effects on scientific publication
rates."

Recent research emphasizes the opportunities of using neurotechnology earlier in the disease progression. However,
earlier use of neurotechnology also raises significant ethical concerns. There are trade-offs and uncertainties involved
in deciding to offer and undergo advanced neurotechnology treatments earlier in the disease progression. This has
changed the ethical decision-making landscape for patients and treating clinicians. For patients, it can be challenging
to assimilate clinical information and make risk–benefit trade-offs to select the most appropriate treatment. For
clinicians it can be challenging to decide when in the disease progression is best to discuss with patient’s advanced
neurotechnologies as therapies. While the literature addresses the opportunities that early use of neurotechnologies
can bring, there is limited research on ethical concerns and decisional needs around their earlier use among patients,
caregivers, and clinicians, and lack of support in decision-making about early use of neurotechnology. This proposed
study addresses those significant gaps by (1) identifying neuroethical issues around shared-decision making (SDM)
associated with the early use of neurotechnology, and (2) developing and testing a patient-centered decision aid
(PtDA) for advanced neurotechnology that can be used at different disease stages. Using a pragmatic neuroethics
framework together with the International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) Collaboration guidelines our goal
is to develop a tool to support SDM and the responsible use of these interventions in different stages of disease
progression. To achieve this goal, our established, transdisciplinary research team, guided by a distinguished Steering
Group, will answer two questions: (1) Are there any relevant differences in ethical issues and decisional needs when
considering advanced neurotechnologies earlier in the disease progression vs. in advanced disease stages? (2) What
impact does a PtDA about advanced neurotechnologies have on decision-making about this type of interventions
(whether and timing), knowledge and attitudes about them, decision conflict, decision satisfaction/regret, and
patient perceived involvement in care? To answer these questions, we will analyze data from interviews and
validated instruments (Aims 1-3). We will examine key neuroethical concerns and decisional needs among patients,
caregivers and clinicians (Aim 1). These results will inform the development of a PtDA (Aim 1). We will then evaluate
comprehensibility and acceptability of PtDA (Aim 2) and evaluate small-scale efficacy and feasibility (Aims 3). The
significance of this work lies in the in-depth new knowledge it will generate regarding specific neuroethical concerns
and decisional needs raised by the earlier use of neurotechnology among patients and clinicians. Responding to the
BRAIN Initiative imperatives, our PtDA will support SDM and ethical use of advanced neurotechnology at different
disease stages."
10948287,"SUMMARY ABSTRACT
In the last ten years, Latinx youth reports of poor mental health (30%), sadness, hopelessness (46%), and
suicide ideation (22%) have significantly increased. Suicide ideation is a risk factor for suicide attempts and
death by suicide. Key risk factors for suicide ideation among Latinx youth include depression symptoms, low
sense of belongingness, and feeling a burden to others. Structural factors, such as low access to care, even
when they report suicide behaviors, place them at high risk. Latinx youth are often uninsured and mistrust
healthcare providers. Given that one in four youth younger than age 18 in the United States is Latinx,
increasing access to care before suicide behaviors onset in this population will make a public health impact.
Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Adolescents (IPT-A; 12-16 sessions), an effective evidence-based intervention
tested with Latinx youth, improves interpersonal functioning and, in turn, reduces depressive symptoms and
suicide ideation. Brief IPT-A (BIPT-A; 6-8 sessions) integrated into community settings and delivered by lay
providers (i.e., task-shifting) offers an opportunity to be used as an upstream suicide approach (before suicide
behaviors onset) and close the Latinx youth mental health access gap. However, research is needed to
examine the feasibility and acceptability of BIPT-A task-shifted to youth community centers where Latinx youth
learn and play. This K23 proposes a comprehensive career development plan to enable the candidate to
become an independent clinical investigator with expertise in implementation science and a recognized leader
in community capacity-building to prevent youth suicide by focusing on three main training goals: 1) Develop
expertise in systematically adapting interventions, 2) develop expertise in the use of task-shifting in suicide
prevention, and 3) gain skills in conducting pragmatic, randomized trials to test implementation strategies and
mechanisms of change pertaining to youth suicide ideation among Latinx youth. Leveraging existing
partnerships with three youth community centers, the proposed study aims to 1) Adapt BIPT-A for its use by lay
providers (i.e., youth mentors) in community centers to decrease depression symptoms, increase
belongingness, and decrease burdensomeness among Latinx youth with threshold score for depression (Aim
1). 2) Train youth mentors in the adapted BIPT-A (Aim 2). 3) Conduct a pilot pragmatic randomized trial to test
feasibility, acceptability, and mechanisms of change of BIPT-A task-shifted to youth mentors (Aim 3). This K23
addresses NIMH's strategic plan by investigating the adaptation and implementation of an evidence-based
mental health intervention in real-world settings with ethnic minoritized populations that has the potential to be
used as a preventive approach to suicide, build community capacity, and increase mental health equity."

 I am committed to a career as a physician-scientist and have a keen interest in receptor biology, with the
goal of translating fundamental findings into improved care of patients. G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs)
are some of the most established drug targets. However, the clinical successes within the GPCR super-family
are not evenly distributed. Certain receptor families have many successful drugs, such as adrenergic GPCRs in
cardiac diseases and dopamine GPCRs in psychiatric diseases. Other GPCR families, such chemokine
receptors, have very few approved drugs. I recently discovered a new GPCR signaling pathway that has
relevance in chemokine signaling. This pathway is differentially regulated by the three chemokines that bind to
CXCR3, which is expressed on activated T cells and drives Th1-mediated inflammation in the skin and other
tissues. The goal of my project is to biochemically define this new GPCR signaling pathway and discover how
this pathway signals in T cells. My mentor, Dr. Andrew Kruse, Professor of Biological Chemistry and Molecular
Pharmacology, was one of the first in the world to obtain high-resolution structures of GPCRs. He has an
established track record of excellent trainees and leading discoveries. Through this project, I will acquire critical
skills in protein purification and structural biology that I currently lack, but which will be instrumental in
establishing my own independent research program. Through Dr. Kruse and my broader advisory committee, I
will also obtain training in skills necessary for my independence, including written and oral communication, grant
writing, leadership and management, and mentoring/teaching.
 My clinical expertise is in autoimmune skin and connective tissue diseases and in the effects of
immunomodulatory medications. Many of the diseases I treat appear to be driven in part by dysfunctional T cell
signaling as highlighted by abnormal cytokine and chemokine profiles. The chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and
CXCL11 bind to the chemokine receptor CXCR3. These, and other chemokines, are abnormally altered in
diseases such as cutaneous lupus and psoriasis. My recently published work and preliminary data show that
CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 cause different post-translational modifications on CXCR3 and lead to divergent
transcriptional responses. Furthermore, CXCL11, but neither CXCL9 nor CXCL10, appears to signal through
this new GPCR signaling pathway. These findings challenge the current paradigm of GPCR signaling. I believe
that therapeutically targeting chemokine receptors has been challenging in-part because we are overlooking key
intracellular signaling pathways that have therapeutic relevance. I believe this project is novel, challenges
established paradigms of receptor signaling, and is clinically significant. Understanding the different chemokine
signaling pathways at the molecular level will help us design new therapeutics with the desired effects."

The overall goal of this project is to address the critical unmet need for longitudinal data from clinical
outcome assessments (COAs) and plasma biomarkers for the rare syndrome of posterior cortical atrophy
(PCA) to enable clinical trial readiness with currently available candidate therapeutics. PCA was described in
1988 in five patients with progressive dementia that began with higher-order visual dysfunction and relative
sparing of `memory, insight, and judgment' with a predominance of atrophy in the parieto-occipital regions. We
now understand that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the underlying pathology in up to 100% of patients and onset
usually occurs at a younger age, between age 50 and 64 years. The visual-predominant phenotype and lack of
longitudinal data combine to impede clinical trial design for PCA. Notably, widely used COAs for AD clinical trials
rely on changes in memory and domains that are relatively spared in PCA, and assessments of higher-order
visual impairment are very limited in COAs in AD trials. For these reasons, PCA presentations of AD do not meet
the inclusion criteria for traditional AD clinical trials. To overcome barriers to inclusion and to clinical trial design,
we will enroll 25 people with PCA, defined by 2017 diagnostic criteria, and longitudinally assess, over one year
the following outcomes 1) one patient-reported and one informant-reported PCA-specific COA, 2) a novel PCA
COA staging method using a probabilistic ordering of decline on 13 tasks that are inclusive of higher-order visual
functions, 3) AD-COAs widely used in AD clinical trials, and 4) plasma biomarkers of neurodegeneration and AD
pathology. In Aims 1 and 2, we will measure the responsiveness of COAs to PCA progression and the reliability
and internal consistency of an informant-based PCA-specific COA. The convergent validity and responsiveness
of the novel PCA staging COA will be assessed in Aim 2. Lastly, we will evaluate the responsiveness of plasma
biomarkers to clinical changes in exploratory Aim 3 in anticipation of the future use of biomarkers as surrogate
markers of treatment impact in a clinical trial. The establishment of these longitudinal benchmark measures using
COAs and plasma biomarkers will serve as an essential foundation for enabling PCA clinical trial readiness with
promising and currently available candidate therapeutics."

 With a prevalence of 10 cases per million, immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is
classified as a rare disease. Yet, it has significant human and economic impacts – untreated mortality rates of
90%; disproportionate effects on women and minorities; and per-patient costs > $1 million. Adding to these
impacts, patients with iTTP report that their most significant health-related quality of life impact is cognitive
function. Yet, despite promising therapeutic candidates (anfibatide and TAK-755) in early phase clinical trials,
cognitive function impacts cannot be accurately measured because a comprehensive assessment of aspects of
cognitive function influenced by iTTP has not been conducted. Though used in iTTP clinical trials, available
cognitive measures lack sufficient validity evidence. Thus, no validity evidence is insufficient for clinical outcome
assessments (COAs) of cognitive function for the context of use of iTTP clinical trials. Without validity evidence
for COAs, iTTP clinical trials cannot align with FDA recommendations for patient-focused drug development:
They cannot incorporate outcomes that are important to patients. Even worse, patients’ cognitive function
response to new therapies cannot be appropriately assessed. Thus, patients cannot be referred for treatments
that improve cognitive function outcomes. Thus, the absence of validity evidence for COAs of cognitive function
is a critical barrier to iTTP clinical trial readiness. To facilitate clinical trial readiness in outcomes that are
important to patients, there is an urgent need to develop a measurement strategy for iTTP-associated cognitive
impairment.
 The objective of the study is to develop a consensus-driven measurement strategy of cognitive function
for iTTP clinical trials. To this end, the study will both determine iTTP impacts on cognitive function and develop
a cognitive function measurement strategy. To this end, the study will use a sequential mixed methods approach.
First, using qualitative interviews of 24 patient-caregiver dyads, the study will develop an iTTP-induced cognitive
impairment draft conceptual model. Second, using both a literature review and a multistakeholder advisory panel,
a consensus-based approach will be used to select cognitive function COAs that have sufficient evidence for
being fit-for purpose. The study will benefit from robust recruitment at 3 participating sites within the National
Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network – PCORNnet®. The study team has expertise in iTTP, neurogenic
disorders, and COA measurement strategy.
 A boon to iTTP clinical trial readiness, successful completion of this study will support the use of cognitive
function COAs that are psychometrically rigorous. Furthermore, because they will be made available in the public
domain, the conceptual and measurement models from this study will be used to further iTTP clinical trials: They
can be accessed by both industry and regulatory agencies. This research is significant because it addresses
cognitive function – the aspect of iTTP survivorship most important to patients. Because it will develop a
consensus-driven measurement strategy of cognitive function, this research is also innovative. Responsive to
PAR-23-159, this research meets the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) priority of
facilitating clinical trial readiness for rare diseases, disorders, and syndromes."
10949450,"Aging is ubiquitous across the tree of life, impacting biology at all levels. Among the hallmarks of aging, the
accumulation of somatic mutations over time has been implicated in many leading causes of death including
cancer10-12, heart disease4, and dementia5. However, most risk factors governing somatic mutation rates and
patterns with age remain unknown. It has recently become possible to study the relationship between somatic
mutation rates and longevity using comparative genomics. Cagan et al. (2022) demonstrated a negative
correlation between somatic mutation rates and longevity, and identified conserved, longevity-associated
mutational spectra across mammals. Yet, this study lacked the power to explore further due to both sparce
taxonomic sampling and low sample sizes per species. Thus, there is an outstanding gap in our knowledge
of how somatic mutational spectra relate to changes in longevity, and the genes involved in longevity-
associated mutational spectra. To properly study the mechanisms governing mutation rates and patterns, one
must sample many individuals from a group of closely-related species spanning a wide range of lifespans.
My central hypothesis is that somatic mutation spectra unique to long-lived mammals are signatures of
enhanced DNA damage repair responses that contribute to their extraordinary longevity. In order to
identify the genetic mechanisms underlying longevity-associated somatic mutational spectra, I have generated
matched skin tissue and cell lines from over 200 individuals across 10 species of a closely related (14 million
years) clade of bats spanning a 3-fold range in lifespans, including the longest-lived bat species in North America.
In Aim 1, to explore how somatic mutation rates co-evolve with longevity and identify longevity-associated
mutational spectra in bats, I will use the highly sensitive NanoSeq to sequence 60 individuals across a trio of
species in skin tissue samples. In Aim 2, using matched cell lines from the same individuals I will identify both
cis and trans regulators of somatic mutation rates and spectra by using the massively parallel CRISPRi screen
Repair-seq. As I transition towards an independent researcher position, in Aim 3 I will expand my functional work
to other tissues and developmental contexts by developing induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from my
collection of bat cell lines, and combine the cell type diversity of embryoid bodies with the power of Repair-seq
to assess DNA damage repair mechanisms across all cell types simultaneously.
This project is the first to explore how somatic mutation rates and spectra co-evolve with longevity
both mechanistically and at high resolution. The foundations of this project will be the cornerstone of my
research program exploring the evolution of longevity-associated traits in extraordinarily long-lived species
using functional genomics. Using iPSCs from non-lethal skin biopsies will enable us to study aging processes
in internal tissues as a part of longitudinal studies, enabling new avenues of research in the comparative
biology of aging."

Pain disparities for U.S. Black adults are well documented, but prevention and treatment efforts rarely target young adults who make up 39% of the population. Our knowledge of pain prevalence, characteristics, and outcomes for young Black adults is very limited. They face significant structural barriers that may hinder them from receiving early and consistent pain treatment. Supporting young Black adults to manage their own pain can prevent pain-related disability and improve quality of life across the lifespan. But we lack critical data on young Black adults’ pain self-management practices and support needs. The Chronic Pain Self-Management Program (CPSMP) is the most widely disseminated and empirically investigated pain self-management education program in the U.S. Participants in the peer-led, workshop-based intervention report short-term improvements in pain severity, pain-related disability, and self-efficacy- making it ideal for advancing young Black adults’ pain self-management competency. But they under-enroll in the program presumably due to cultural incongruences, and inattention to the social determinants of health that increase pain in Black adults. Also, pain self-management interventions commonly exclude mind-body therapies proven to reduce pain severity and psychological comorbidities for Black adults. The goal of the K01 Award is to support Dr. De’Sha Wolf, an Early Career Social Scientist and KL2 Scholar at the Oregon Health and Science University, with establishing a community-based research agenda for improving pain self-management for young Black adults. A transdisciplinary team of mentors and collaborators will support her career development training in: mixed methods implementation science, participatory research with Black communities, pain medicine and culturally tailored mind-body therapies, and facilitation of behavioral health interventions. The research will be guided by an ecological approach to self-management. A Community Advisory Board will play a key role in achieving the following Specific Aims: 1) determine the clinical characteristics, comorbidities, and treatments young Black adults use for chronic pain; 2) identify young Black adults’ attitudes, use, and perceived effectiveness of pain self-management strategies, mind-body CAM preferences, and pain management support needs using mixed methods, and 3) culturally and structurally adapt the evidence-based CPSMP for young Black adults through collaboration with community. The K01 study will yield a protocolized intervention for chronic pain self-management that will be used for a future R-level feasibility study. The proposed study aligns with NCCIH’s top scientific priority, complementary and integrative management of pain, and NIH Stage Model 1A. It incorporates community-based research approaches that uplift young Black adults as experts of their own care, and contributes to studies incorporating culturally-tailored CAM therapies into coordinated pain management for Black adults. Achievement of the K01 objectives will position Dr. Wolf to pursue her long-term goal of using integrative medicine to create community-based solutions for chronic pain affecting Black adults."

Adolescent alcohol misuse is a significant risk factor for alcohol use disorder in adulthood. Particularly
concerning are the long-term effects on brain maturation and associated cognitive function, including the ability
to appropriately process and respond to pain. A growing body of research indicates that adolescent alcohol
misuse enhances pain sensitivity and anxiety in adulthood, and increased pain sensitivity and heightened
anxiety may increase the risk for alcohol misuse later in life. Recently, a role for a circuit involving the
basolateral amygdala (BLA), prelimbic (PrL) cortex, and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) in pain
processing has been described. Within this circuit, activation of the BLA by nociceptive stimuli results in
increased feedforward inhibition of PrL neurons projecting to the vlPAG (PrLPAG). This feedforward inhibition is
mediated by parvalbumin interneurons (PVINs) in the PrL. Within this circuit, PVINs modulate pain sensitivity
and pain-related affect by regulating the activity of PrLPAG neurons. Adolescence is a critical period for
development. Environmental insults occurring during adolescence, such as those caused by repeated
episodes of binge-like alcohol consumption, disrupt normal development of PrL circuitry. These changes
include reduced intrinsic excitability of and evoked AMPA and NMDA mediated currents onto PVINs. In
addition, preliminary data we have collected indicates that following adolescent intermittent alcohol exposure
the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance evoked by optogenetic stimulation of BLA terminals in the PrL cortex is
reduced at PrL PVINs and increased at PrLPAG neurons. Further, following alcohol exposure during
adolescence, the density of perineuronal nets (PNNs) which enwrap PVINs and restrict plasticity is increased
in the PrL. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that persistent changes in synaptic function following
AIE are associated with altered activation patterns of PrL PVINs and PrLPAG neurons that are correlated with
altered pain sensitivity. We further hypothesize that digestion of PNNs using chondroitinase ABC will reverse
changes in the E/I balance at PrL PVINs and PrLPAG neurons. The proposed studies will use a combination of
cell-type and projection specific chemogenetic manipulations to determine the effect of changes in the activity
of PrL PVINs and PrLPAG neurons on nociception and pain-related affect following adolescent alcohol exposure.
Changes in the activation patterns of PrL PVINs and PrLPAG neurons in response to nociceptive stimuli will also
be assessed using fiber photometry. Finally, to determine whether PNNs stabilize altered synaptic function
following adolescent alcohol exposure, PNNs will be digested and the E/I balance at BLA inputs onto PVINs
and PrLPAG neurons will be measured using acute slice electrophysiology. These experiments will provide
valuable insights into how changes in PrL PVIN and PrLPAG synaptic function resulting from adolescent alcohol
exposure affect pain threshold in adulthood."
10949040,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rapidly progressing disease characterized by relentless extracellular
matrix (ECM) deposition and lung stiffening that leads to death 3-4 years after diagnosis. IPF disease monitoring
largely relies on high-resolution computed tomography imaging and pulmonary function tests, which are unable
to assess ECM deposition or real-time disease activity. Since there is currently no method to evaluate ECM
deposition and real-time disease activity, and given the importance of determining disease progression in
therapeutic decision-making, there is a critical need for improved methods to assess IPF disease activity in real-
time. Dr. Bernau's long-term goal is to establish an independent research career dedicated to developing new
molecular imaging methods that facilitate diagnosis and treatment of disorders characterized by aberrant wound
healing, especially IPF. Molecular probes optimized for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging enable
sensitive assessment of target engagement, making this an attractive modality for non-invasive monitoring of
disease activity. In this proposal, Dr. Bernau will leverage her expertise in matrix biology of IPF, small animal
imaging with training in PET imaging, probe development, pharmacology, and additional animal models of lung
fibrosis to develop a novel PET probe optimized to determine the activity and treatment response of human IPF.
 Fibronectin (FN) is an abundant glycoprotein that is highly upregulated during IPF, serves as a scaffold for
other ECM proteins, including collagens, and is localized to fibroblastic foci, the leading edge of active fibrosis.
Due to its essential role in early phases of the fibrotic process, the rationale for this proposal is that identifying
regions of nascent FN deposition can serve as a tool for distinguishing active fibrosis and assessing disease
progression. Dr. Bernau and her team developed a novel probe (PEG-FUD) that is innovative in its capacity to
target early ECM deposition in fibroblastic foci in human IPF and early pro-fibrotic phases of bleomycin-induced
pulmonary fibrosis in mice (via in vivo PET imaging). The objective of this proposal is to address the probe's key
characteristics for detection of fibrotic disease activity and adapt it for downstream clinical translation, including
optimization of its signal to background ratio within 1 h post-injection. To accomplish this, Dr. Bernau Aims to: 1)
Optimize FUD's imaging performance while preserving FN binding affinity in vitro and in vivo, and 2) Determine
how 64Cu-PEG-FUD probe can monitor disease progression and response to antifibrotic therapies. Dr. Bernau
is supported by the rich research infrastructure and resources of her Mentorship and Advisory Committee, the
Department of Medicine, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. These studies will enable Dr. Bernau's future
work focused on subsequent pre-clinical developments of PEG-FUD as a probe for active lung fibrosis.
Importantly, this project and training period will serve as a foundation for an independent research career focused
on molecular probe development for IPF and other disorders characterized by aberrant wound healing, informing
the choice of optimal treatment and improving morbidity and mortality for these devastating conditions."

Low physical activity (PA) levels have been associated with elevated risk of Alzheimer’s dementia and
related disorders (ADRD). The bulk of this evidence has been derived from self-report measures of
PA and focused solely on PA volume and intensity. Objective PA assessment and quantifying
dynamics of continuous PA fluctuations over time using accelerometry may extend this area of
science by identifying early changes in functional capacity and emergent motor dysfunction, allowing
for a deeper understanding of how such changes are connected to brain aging and AD risk. We thus
developed a novel metric – “PA complexity” using the multiscale entropy (MSE) method to quantify
daily activity patterns by analyzing continuous accelerometer signals and apply this complexity
measure to a diverse older population in the Human Connectome Project – Connectomics in Brain
Aging and Dementia. This proposed study aims to (1) explore the associations between PA
complexity and cognitive function across multiple domains and risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
and AD, (2) determine whether low PA complexity relates to AT(N) biomarker classifications and white
matter hyperintensities, (3) and examine whether low PA complexity is associated with brain atrophy.
This study is significant because (1) understanding the link between complexity of daily PA patterns,
cognitive function, and brain atrophy has the potential to yield new insights into the underlying
mechanisms connecting motor dysfunction to brain aging, (2) identifying altered complexity of activity
patterns as preclinical indicators of ADRD will suggest novel directions for tailored interventions to
further prevent or delay the onset of ADRD."
10950527,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Walking and balance impairment resulting from stroke significantly reduces functional walking independence,
increases fall risk, and is a rising public health issue. The time window to have the greatest impact after a stroke
is within the first six months, yet there is limited knowledge of the drivers of balance and walking recovery in this
period. In addition, the lack of mechanistic grounding regarding anatomical correlates of walking and balance
recovery after stroke limits the ability for customized and targeted non-invasive neuromodulation protocols.
Hence, there is an urgent need to identify reliable physiologic and neuroanatomic correlates in the earlier stages
of recovery (<6 months) to enable timely and targeted rehabilitation interventions. This developmental research
proposal aims to longitudinally track the development of post-stroke sensory reweighting (PSR) in the first six
months after stroke, identify associated structural neuroanatomical correlates, and investigate their relationship
to walking and fall outcomes. The central hypothesis is that PSR development is critical for walking and balance
recovery and is related to the extent of injury to critical sensorimotor integration networks and descending motor
tracts. The rationale for the proposed research is its expectation to yield relevant information on the mechanisms
of walking and balance recovery and establish a framework to develop targeted strategies for rehabilitation in
stroke and related disorders. Dr. Oluwole Awosika, an early-stage clinical investigator with expertise in post-
stroke walking recovery and non-invasive neuromodulation, will lead this proposal. He has assembled an
excellent team of collaborating investigators with expertise in longitudinal clinical trial recruitment and retention
in the acute hospital setting (Dr. Stacie Demel), post-stroke multimodal neuroimaging (Dr. Brady Williamson),
human biomechanics (Dr. Amit Bhattacharya), and biostatistics (Dr. Heidi Sucharew). The study hypotheses will
be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Serially investigate the development of PSR (1a) and determine its
relationship to walking speed (1b) and falls (1c) at 2-, 4-, and 6-months post-stroke and 2) Exploring the
relationship between the degree of structural injury to the parieto-insular vestibular cortical network (PIVC-N),
corticospinal (CST), and corticoreticulospinal (CRT) tracts. Under the first aim, static posturography will be used
to determine PSR status and will be correlated to walking speed and interval fall incidence. The second aim will
explore the relationship between the mean fractional anisotropy of the PIVC-N, CST, and CRT on diffusion tensor
imaging and PSR status at six months. This proposed research is innovative because it is mechanistically driven,
methodologically rigorous, and uses cutting-edge technology to investigate the early determinants of post-stroke
walking and balance recovery. The project is significant because it will shed light on potential mechanisms and
neuroanatomical correlates of walking and balance recovery early after stroke, help to optimize post-acute
rehabilitation strategies, and provide key considerations in designing future walking rehabilitation trials."

1. Executive Summary of Predicate SBIR Phase I Grant and Team
The overall goal of our predicate SBIR Phase I grant is to validate the Eysz mobile health (mHealth) application
and develop algorithms to diagnose and monitor childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) in the clinical setting.
Eysz, Inc. is developing a mobile health (mHealth) application and algorithms to remotely diagnose and
monitor CAE to improve outcomes. Currently, absence seizures are challenging to identify,leading to diagnostic
delays and difficulty measuring treatment efficacy. Untreated seizures place children at risk for accidental injury
and learning loss. The gold standard for seizure detection is video EEG (VEEG), but it is expensive, limited to
clinical settings, and hard to access. As a result, clinicians rely on self-reports, despite studies showing
patients report only 6% of all absence seizures, and caregivers report only 14%. Even primary care providers
have difficulty identifying absence seizures and rely on VEEG, referring 5 patients for every 1 diagnosed. Once
diagnosed with CAE, children are started on anti-seizure medications (ASM), which result in seizure freedom in
less than 60% of children. However, no new treatments have been approved since the 1990s, partially due to
difficulty measuring seizures.4 Other strategies to monitor seizures, such as ambulatory EEG, lack the
sensitivity and specificity of VEEG, and can add to the stigma of people with epilepsy. Thus, there is a
critical need for a remote diagnostic/monitoring tool for absence seizures.
The aim of the SBIR proposal is to test and further develop an mHealth app that uses (1) supervised guided
hyperventilation (HV), with (2) eye movement and facial biometric data to monitor seizure susceptibility and
treatment responses in CAE. Achieving these goals will decrease costs of care, morbidity, and mortality and
improve quality of life for those with childhood absence epilepsy.
CAE is the most common pediatric epilepsy syndrome, affecting 10–17% of all children with epilepsy. Seizures
occur many times daily and consist of brief losses of consciousness (LOC), with immediate return to baseline
awareness and activity. Seizures typically manifest as staring spells, sometimes with rhythmic eye blinking or
motor automatisms. As LOC may occur at any time without warning, absence seizures have a significant
impact on quality of life (QOL), and accidental injury is common, with 20% of young adults—3% per
year—suffering an injury during a seizure. The clinical course of CAE is variable, and remission rates are far
lower than in other idiopathic epilepsies. In five prospective cohort studies, only 57–74% achieved seizure
freedom. Thus, there is a critical need for new therapeutics for absence epilepsy and better tools for monitoring
therapeutic responses.
The current standard of care for measuring treatment outcomes is self-reported data. Large-scale clinical trials,
including those testing new antiseizure medications, population-based assessments, and other epidemiological
studies also use self-reporting to determine optimal therapy regimens. Critically, however, multiple clinical
studies show patient seizure counts provide inaccurate information. Patients report only 6% of all experienced
absence seizures, whereas caregivers report only 14%. In a recent study examining self-documentation of
absence seizures by adults with idiopathic generalized epilepsy, inaccurate seizure counts were found to
substantially impact outpatient management and treatment.
The gold standard for detecting and characterizing seizure activity is a neurologist reading of a VEEG. In the
home setting, where > 99% of seizures occur, VEEG is not readily available because of poor patient
acceptability, poor detection capability, high cost and continued reliance on asynchronous review. The FDA
has approved two non-EEG-based devices to detect convulsive seizures, but these are responsible for only <
25% of all seizure activity. To address this significant unmet market need, Eysz is developing an mHealth app
and accompanying algorithms to improve diagnosis and monitoring of CAE. The mHealth app standardizes the
approach for administering and quantitating the effectiveness of HV-induced seizures. The app uses
animations and interactive graphics to guide users through HV while capturing audiovisual data. Eye
movements, facial biometrics, number and length of exhales, and other associated data will be used to
measure the effectiveness of HV to detect HV-induced seizure activity, providing an affordable and accessible
tool to reliably monitor absence seizures. This initial grant focuses on an in-clinic release with additional work
needed prior to the release of the device in a home setting.
This proposal focuses on developing algorithms for analysis of video quality, effectiveness of HV, and seizure
identification using a smartphone-based guided HV app. The Specific Aims are:
Aim 1: Collect data from the Eysz mHealth app concurrently with VEEG and assess usability.
Aim 2: Evaluate the potential for a new “gold standard” metric for algorithm validation. Evaluate if the
the majority of 3 epileptologists reading the video produced by the Eysz mHealth app identify absence seizures
with >80% sensitivity and specificity compared with the majority agreement of 3 independent epileptologists
reviewing VEEG.
Aim 3. Develop ML methods that use facial biometrics and eye tracking data to quantitate seizures.
Our proposed I-Corp team will include the following 3 members, who are committed to the time requirements of
the program.

2. I-Corps team and Project Plan
The aim of our predicate SBIR Phase I grant is to validate that a clinician read of the video from the Eysz
mHealth App is equivalent to video EEG read and develop AI based algorithm for seizure identification.
Achieving these aims will signal successful completion of Phase I and our readiness to transition to Phase II.
The learnings from the Phase I grant will be incorporated into the app to improve usability and allow for the
App to be tested in the home environment, and validate our seizure detection algorithm as we work towards
FDA clearance and commercialization readiness.
The Eysz team participated in the NIH I-Corp program during our previous SBIR phase 1 grant. While the
results of the SBIR were technically successful, the data collected during the I-Corp program informed our
decision to pivot from a continuous use wearable eye tracking glass to an intermittent usage smartphone
based app to better meet the customer and market needs. Given the significant pivot, our goal with this NIH
I-Corp is to work towards commercial readiness by refining our business model including: reimbursement
strategy, business/pricing models, and understanding the purchasing process as we work towards FDA
clearance.
Our proposed I-Corps team will include the following 3 members.

The team, which has been collaborating since February 2020, has demonstrated expertise in clinical research,
product development, and commercialization. The following is a summary of their expertise:
Rachel Kuperman, MD (PI/PD) leads the management team and clinical research. Rachel is a neurologist with
dual certification in epilepsy and neurology and has over 10 years’ experience directing the clinical epilepsy
and research programs at UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital, Oakland. She is also the inventor of the core
technology and has a strong background in clinical research, having served as the PI on multiple clinical trials,
including being the PI for multiple SBIR Phase I grants. Her undergraduate degree in physics from UCSD, and
her neurology and neurophysiology training at Columbia and UCSF, have helped her bridge the
clinical/computational divide. Early in her career, Dr. Kuperman was identified as a leader at Children’s
Hospital, where she was invited to participate in the UCSF Physician Leadership Program in 2011. Dr.
Kuperman was awarded $80K in grants from UCSF, including the Junior Investigator Award for research,
towards development of her patent. She was recognized by the Epilepsy Foundation of Northern California
with the Volunteer of the Year award in 2016. Dr. Kuperman was a Fall 2018 Fellow at UC Berkeley Law Form
and Fund, which focuses on the core legal, financial, and organizational aspects of starting and scaling a
business. She has since received the Ferolyn Fellowship award from the Fogarty Institute for Innovation,
which provides mentoring to rising medtech leaders with a passion to transform healthcare.
Parth Amin, our Chief Operating Officer, brings 20 years of medical device experience, including having
worked for global healthcare companies such as Siemens Healthineers, Varian Medical Systems, and
Omnicell. He has held a variety of pivotal roles in the areas of product management, program management,
and alliance management while successfully attaining objectives related to innovation, product development,
revenue, and market share growth. His expertise in product development and alliances, with an emphasis on
go-to-market strategies involving partnered solutions, has allowed us to start identifying and establishing key
technology, clinical, and commercial partners, who in turn will enable us to translate this meaningful innovation
into a commercially viable product. As part of 3-2 Dual Degree Program, Mr. Amin holds a BE in Electrical
Engineering from Washington University and B.S in Pre-Engineering from Birmingham-Southern College.
Tracey Fisher is an accomplished business executive with over 20 years of global healthcare marketing
experience. She has built and led marketing teams that have launched medical device products and brands
that became global market leaders and generated over $1B in revenue, while working at Siemens Healthineers
and Varian Medical Systems. Through collaboration with patient advocacy, government advocacy, regulatory,
reimbursement, sales, and product teams she has defined business/pricing models and value propositions to
build successful new product introduction and marketing strategies and oversee the execution. With her
expertise and guidance, we are confident that we will achieve our aims for the NIH-I Corps program.
During the early stages of our company formation, we participated in the National Science Foundation (NSF)
I-Corps program, which was extremely beneficial in helping us understand the epilepsy ecosystem and craft
our initial value proposition. At that time, our team performed 111 interviews of patients, family members,
physicians, payors, pharmaceutical researchers, competitors and potential collaborators. During our previous
NIH I-Corp program we completed over 100 interviews that significantly changed the course of our product and
research. Since the NIH program, we have had an additional Pre-Sub meeting with the FDA, completed our
initial clinical study and pivoted towards a product with better market fit. Based on the interactions with our
partners, and clinical collaborators, we have reformulated our value proposition, pursued additional patents
and refined our regulatory and reimbursement strategy.
The overall goal of participating in the NIH I-Corps is to take our vision and value proposition and add the
granularity which will align our clinical research milestones, regulatory strategy, IP strategy,reimbursement
strategy and fundraising milestones, ultimately leading to successful commercialization strategy which will
position us to obtain venture funding and a Phase II SBIR. We particularly need to do additional risk mitigation
around our revenue model, which focuses on use of existing reimbursement codes and possibly applying for
additional codes, obtaining payment from payers, and ensuring our unit costs and channel partners are aligned
for scaling growth. A structured, healthcare-focused program like that offered by NIH I-Corps would build upon
the tremendous work to date and set the company up for success as we advance our current NIH-funded
initiative to the next phase of development.
Our team is ideally positioned to have maximal benefit from the NIH I-Corps program. Our SBIR Phase I grant
has allowed us to develop and align as a team from a technical perspective. The I-Corps program will enable
us to expand our current technical focus to pre-commercialization topics. We believe that customer discovery
interviews and the lean launchpad system are a timely, structured method to assist our company as we make
this transition from our previous position and have benefited us greatly in the past.
Commercial Potential
Through > 200 customer discovery interviews supported by the NSF + NIH I-Corps program and continued
customer discovery interviews – with epilepsy patients, clinicians, pharmaceutical companies, EEG
manufacturers, and patient advocacy groups – we are confident in the commercialization potential of our
technology. By establishing and growing a partner ecosystem, we are minimizing commercial risks while
expanding our commercial opportunities. While our initial plan was to partner with eye tracking manufacturers,
our new product focuses on using existing smartphone technology reducing many of the hurdles that we
identified during our previous I-Corp. In particular it will significantly reduce our time to market, decrease the
funding requirements, improve user satisfaction and significantly simplify distribution. Lastly, pharmaceutical
companies have expressed strong interest, as shown by financial investments and planned clinical
partnerships to use our solution to assess the efficacy of anticonvulsants in clinical studies. Eysz has received
grant support from Greenwich Biosciences. UCB Pharma, the largest epilepsy drug developer, has also
invested in Eysz.
We are focused on the clinical care market. In the digital health space, commercialization relies heavily on
developing a reimbursement strategy. We plan on leveraging existing CPT codes including behavioral health
codes, remote monitoring codes and nonspecific neurodiagnostic codes. This planning has been complicated
by recent COVID-related changes in telehealth and remote monitoring reimbursement, but we are reassured
that the headwinds towards additional coverage are supporting our reimbursement strategy.
We estimate the overall U.S. market opportunity to be around $3.4 Billion dollars, given the direct costs
associated with epilepsy. With our initial FDA clearance for absence seizures, we expect to capture 5% of the
market ($170M) in 5 years.
Target Customer
For the clinical care market, our end user will be pediatricians and neurologists at a Level 3 + 4 Epilepsy
Center. We understand that purchasing decisions are not solely made by clinicians, but they are influential in
the decision-making process. As part of the I-Corps program, we aim to better understand how products are
recommended for purchasing by neuro service line managers, and pediatric managers, how reimbursement
decisions are made by payors, how best to reach influencers and decision-makers, and the level of integration
with existing workflow required to facilitate adoption.
Clinical Need and Current Alternatives
More than 70 million people worldwide—including ~1% of the U.S. population—suffer from epilepsy, a
debilitating, unpredictable chronic condition in which abnormal electrical activity in the brain produces physical
disturbances including loss of consciousness (LOC) and/or convulsions. Epilepsy is associated with disability,
reduced quality of life, and an elevated risk of comorbidities, including seizure-related injuries; respiratory,
cardiovascular, and neurologic dysfunctions; and psychological conditions such as anxiety and depression.
Outcomes include long-term disability and increased risk of mortality, and epilepsy accounts for 0.5% of the
global burden of disease based on years of life lost (YLL) and years lost to disability (YLD). Globally, the costs
associated with epilepsy are staggering. In the U.S. alone, direct costs have more than doubled in less than a
decade—from $12B to $28B—while outcomes have not improved for almost 3 decades. In addition, epilepsy
accounts for more than 1 million emergency department (ED) visits and over 280,000 hospital admissions
annually in the U.S., with aggregate hospital costs for epilepsy totaling approximately $2.5 billion.
Seizures represent the key symptom of epilepsy and the primary target of epilepsy treatment. Detection of
seizures is the first step in choosing an appropriate treatment regimen, and appropriate anticonvulsants can
decrease seizures by 50%. Unfortunately, current detection technologies are impractical or have limited
effectiveness outside of clinical settings, as described below:
Self-reporting/Observation: As for many other chronic conditions, epilepsy patients are often asked to keep a
seizure diary. Critically, however, patient-reported seizure counts do not provide accurate information.
Studies have shown that during video EEG, caregivers and patients fail to recognize more than 50% of
seizures. In addition, constant seizure observation substantially reduces quality of life due to loss of sleep,
schedule disruption, and anxiety about missing seizure activity. Thus, both patients and clinicians are aware of
the need for a feasible ambulatory technique for the objective detection and registration of seizures.
Outpatient EEG: There have been many attempts to convert the gold standard of EEG plus video observation
into a less burdensome mobile platform. To date, however, video EEG remains expensive, largely limited to
hospital settings, uncomfortable for patients, and associated with a significant delay between seizure activity
and diagnosis. A proposed alternative is ambulatory EEG platforms, which forego the video portion to enable
use at home, but these too have significant limitations. In particular, removal of the video portion of the EEG
significantly reduces EEG sensitivity and specificity. Neurologists are taught not to make decisions based
on EEG alone, severely limiting the utility of video-free outpatient EEG detection methods. Another recent
approach is to remove the role of physicians in EEG interpretation and instead to develop ML-based algorithms
to identify seizures in EEGs in real time, but these are not yet sensitive or specific enough to use without
physician review. Finally, while EEG-based wearables have increased in number and improved in usability and
aesthetics, the challenges associated with the use of EEG as an underlying technology have still not been
addressed.
Non-EEG Devices: Given the limitations of adapting video-based and non-video-based EEG seizure detection
devices, other solutions have been developed that rely on a combination of different detection methods,
including accelerometers, electromyography, infrared motion detectors, or other means to track convulsive
seizures (i.e., generalized tonic-clonic seizures, or GTCs, which make up < 25% of all seizures). These mobile
devices use signals from biometric sources such as limited EEG, heart rate, motion sensors, limb
acceleration/movement, electrodermal activity, muscle activation, and audio/video. However, these solutions
are not comprehensive enough to cover both GTC and non-convulsive seizures, have high
false-positive rates, and/or have clinically unacceptable sensitivity/specificity.
Due to the limitations of current technologies outlined above, there remains a critical need for a more robust
technology that can detect a broader variety of seizures and alert caregivers or healthcare providers to ensure
timely intervention.
Competitive Advantage
Eysz is developing an mHealth app and accompanying algorithms to improve diagnosis and monitoring of
CAE. A standard HV tool that could aid doctors in patient diagnosis and supplement home seizure diaries will
improve CAE diagnosis, management and therapeutic development. Doctors and caregivers currently do not
have an accurate way to identify changes in absence seizure frequency or reliably monitor treatment benefits.
Since clinicians struggle to identify absence seizures, the utilization of the Eysz mHealth tool in PCP offices will
lead to faster, more appropriate referrals. For neurologists, the Eysz tool will help with titrate medicines and
guide the decision to perform a VEEG for seizure freedom. As pharmaceutical studies currently rely on
self-reported seizure counts and >24-hour VEEGs in hospital settings, Eysz would decrease costs and improve
patient access to clinical studies for absence epilepsy. As a more accurate, reproducible method of seizure
monitoring, the app has the potential to transform the diagnosis and management of absence seizures,
improving drug development, medical decision-making, and patient QOL. Eysz intends to first demonstrate the
utility of the mobile seizure monitoring in CAE, then expand into the larger patient population of focal impaired
awareness seizures (FIAS).
Price Estimate
EEG hardware costs $20K–30K per unit, with charges of $500/hour for an outpatient EEG or $2500–5000/day
for inpatient EEG (average hospitalization of 2–3 days). Smartphone technology is ubiquitous and costs are
anticipated to decrease significantly in the coming years. These compatible technologies could potentially be
used for several months/years without losing performance. Existing CPT codes, which could be utilized for the
Eysz solution, reimburse $100–200 per month, making the Eysz solution a highly affordable option compared
to EEG. As part of the I-Corps program, we aim to understand how to price for clinical value when
reimbursement may not be present, understand channel costs, pricing models for fee for service institutions
and fee for value institutions, and scalability of this approach.
4. Project Plan
With our previous clinical study we were able to develop a technically sound product. We pivoted our product
based on extensive customer discovery. This SBIR phase 1 plans to validate our App based solution and
transition our AI based algorithm developed in our previous SBIR. Thus, in this Phase I SBIR, Eysz plans to
obtain data from 45 children with absence seizures and 30 without and to use a combination of traditional
signal processing and ML techniques to refine an algorithm to achieve the high sensitivity required for use as a
seizure monitor. Towards that goal the clinical study is in IRB review. We are confident in our ability to enroll
the necessary patients based on Cincinnati Children’s high patient volume. During this technical phase we
plan on doing extensive work towards our pre-commercialization, with an emphasis on developing channel
partners, regulatory and reimbursement strategies."
10944514,"Project Summary:
For this proposal in response to PAR-22-085: Microbial-based Cancer Imaging and Therapy - Bugs as Drugs,
we will focus on metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), for several reasons: PDAC is
particularly difficult to target and generally considered recalcitrant, but the pancreatic tumor microenvironment
(TME) features an abundance of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and few T cells. Therefore, methods
to reprogram TAMs and enhance T-cell activation and proliferation will likely synergize with radiotherapy and
checkpoint immunotherapy to control local and metastatic disease.
 Bifidobacteria is a commensal that preferentially targets tumors, and oral Bifidobacteria has been found to
translocate from the gastrointestinal tract with subsequent homing to and replication specifically in tumors.
Building on these findings, we recently reported that systemically administered Bifidobacterium (i.v.)
specifically colonize and replicate in hypoxic tumor regions. Notably, we also found that i.v. administration of
Bifidobacterium also converted non-responding mice into responders, in the context of local immunotherapy
and/or ionizing radiation (IR). This data serves as proof-of-principle that systemic administration of
Bifidobacterium can enhance tumor control in combination with immunotherapy and/or IR.
 We have now successfully developed genetic tools to regulate gene expression in Bifidobacterium longum.
We propose to investigate the systemic administration of genetically-engineered Bifidobacterium delivering a
novel human IL-2 (SumIL2) to the TME in combination with radiotherapy and/or immunotherapy. This strategy
centers on harnessing both innate and adaptive pro-immune responses and is aimed at capitalizing on several
known mechanisms of tumor evasion. In addition, our plan to include a precise gene circuit for precise protein
secretion and bacteria self-destruction is a systemic therapeutic delivery innovation. Most importantly, we
anticipate that our approach using Bifidobacterium will elicit significant anti- tumor effects for several reasons:
1. Bifidobacterium is selectively taken up by tumors, and SumIL2 secretion is precisely controlled after bacteria
colonization, which will obviate the treatment-limiting toxicity commonly associated with IL-2 administration.
2. Our preliminary data presented here indicate that systemic (IV) administration of Bifidobacterium converts
non-responder mice into responders to anti-CD47 immunotherapy and radiotherapy.
3. In contrast to E. coli, Bifidobacterium is a human commensal anaerobic bacterium, giving our approach a
less toxic profile and more translational relevance.
 Our approach takes advantage of the natural features and genetic engineering of Bifidobacterium to
reinvigorate the immune suppressive TME via systemic injection, and thus could have broad applicability in
other hard-to-treat cancers."
10947153,"ABSTRACT [30 lines]
The continued growth of syphilis cases in the United States is associated with signiﬁcant maternal-fetal
morbidity and mortality, health disparities for racial/ethnic minorities, and men who have sex with men (MSM).
Rising case counts have led to a shortage of penicillin, the treatment of choice for the etiologic agent of syphilis,
Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum, and the only approved therapy for pregnant patients and neonates. Penicillin
shortages have led to increased reliance on doxycycline for treatment and prophylaxis, but patient compliance
is suboptimal, particularly for doxycycline treatment which requires twice daily dosing for > 14 days. These
conditions - high case counts, increased use of doxycycline, and potential incomplete treatment – are ripe for
selection of doxycycline resistant T. pallidum strains. A previous second line treatment, single dose azithromycin,
is no longer recommended due to high rates of resistance (> 79%) observed among MSM. However, susceptible
strains may circulate among non-MSM populations where resistance rates have historically been much lower
(11%) suggesting there are still patients who could beneﬁt from azithromycin therapy. Unfortunately, there are
no clinical assays that detect T. pallidum resistance to either drug. Such assays would serve the dual purposes of
public health surveillance and informing therapeutic antibiotic selection, particularly for patients
unlikely/unable to comply with multiday doxycycline treatment. Resistance to azithromycin is mediated by
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 23S rRNA gene and doxycycline resistance is predicted to
emerge as SNPs in the 16S rRNA gene. Resistance-conferring SNPs are amenable to molecular detection by
allele-speciﬁc nucleic acid ampliﬁcation assays. We have previously developed and validated in our clinical
laboratory a sensitive and speciﬁc Reverse-Transcription Loop-mediated isothermal Ampliﬁcation (RT-LAMP)
molecular test for T. pallidum and are currently validating the assay in a multiplexed, point-of-care (POC) format.
In this project, we propose to build upon our existing assays by developing complementary approaches to detect
antibiotic resistance in T. pallidum. The deliverables will be a POC allele-speciﬁc LAMP for drug resistance (AS-
LAMP) multiplexed with organism detection and an internal ampliﬁcation control, and a parallel next-
generation sequencing (NGS) assay for high-complexity clinical laboratories. In Aim 1, we propose to develop
and validate both a POC AS-LAMP and an amplicon-NGS assay for detection of SNPs mediating azithromycin
resistance. In Aim 2, we propose to develop and validate an amplicon-NGS assay for detection of doxycycline
resistance and to develop a panel of AS-LAMP primers that can be deployed following detection of emerging
doxycycline resistance genotypes. After primer and protocol optimization, we will validate the assays following
established procedures for deploying clinical assays in CLIA- and CAP-certiﬁed laboratories. Our goal is to
generate inexpensive, rapid POC testing for T. pallidum drug resistance to guide optimal therapy during a single
patient encounter and to improve public health surveillance for drug resistant strains."
10947204,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal disease that is usually asymptomatic at an early stage.
In addition, metastases can be present even when the cancer size is relatively small. Most PDAC patients
succumb within 6 months of diagnosis with only 12% of patients surviving more than five years. Clinical assays
that can assist detection of incipient and early PDAC when effective treatment is possible would improve the
survival rate and change the grim outlook of this disease. Unfortunately, CA19-9, the current blood-based
clinical biomarker for PDAC, does not provide the accuracy needed for diagnosis, even in high-risk groups of
patients. The demands on an effective biomarker for PDAC detection are considerably high compared to many
other cancer biomarkers, because while the disease is less common, it is more deadly. Mass spectrometry
(MS)-based methods have increasingly been emerging for clinical diagnosis, representing a technology ripe for
cancer biomarker detection in clinical settings. We have previously developed a MS-based proteomic assay
that significantly outperforms CA19-9 for PDAC blood detection. In this study, we aim to further validate this
existing assay for PDAC blood detection through collaborative, multi-discipline efforts. Our team will conduct
in-depth analytical and clinical validations to: 1) determine the performance characteristics and robustness of
the assay in the context of clinical utilization; 2) refine the assay accuracy and thresholds for PDAC detection
using well-annotated case-control cohorts from multiple centers; and 3) evaluate the efficacy of the assay for
early detection of PDAC using pre-diagnostic cohort. The development of this proteomic assay will provide a
non-invasive and affordable blood test to assist current work-up for PDAC detection in high-risk populations.
This study is well-aligned with NCI’s Special Interest in analytical and clinical validation of assays for early
detection of cancer using existing cohorts and prospective study designs."

In this application, we are seeking supplemental funding for Wave 2 activities of the Longitudinal
Aging Study in India (LASI). This application builds upon LASI and its allied study, LASI-DAD, a
nationally representative survey focused on late-life cognition and dementia in India. The main
LASI survey provides socioeconomic and other behavioral data for LASI-DAD respondents,
which are not collected as part of the LASI-DAD survey. This information is essential to achieve
the aims of the parent LASI-DAD grant, specifically related to assessing cognitive changes over
time, understanding their correlates, and estimating the economic and caregiving burdens of
dementia. This application seeks funding for the efforts by the HSPH and USC teams to help
International Institute for Population Sciences with for the implementation of the follow-up
interviews of Wave 1 LASI respondents (N~74,000) as well as newly age-eligible respondents
within the sampled households in 36 states and union territories of India. Specifically, this
application aims to conduct the following: 1) updating and programming the Wave 2 instrument,
including the addition of a new COVID-19 module and capturing socioeconomic changes during
the unplanned 4-year delay of LASI Wave 2; 2) conducting pretests and refining the research
instrument; 3) tracking the sample; 4) training trainers and field investigators; 5) implementing
real-time data monitoring and quality control measures; and 6) obtaining ethical clearance for
future genomics studies. Dr. David Bloom and Dr. Jinkook Lee will lead the investigative team
for LASI Wave 2 at HSPH and USC respectively. These activities are critical for ensuring quality
assurance and harmonization of the LASI survey with the Health and Retirement Study and its

10951303,"3. Abstract
Inflammation is a beneficial response to infection or tissue damage and mediates the removal of
microbial pathogens and restoration of the tissue to homeostasis. Occasionally the inflammatory
response does not resolve properly and becomes a chronic process, resulting in diseases such as
arthritis, asthma, and many others. Significant effort has gone into developing therapeutics to block
the development of inflammation; however, these approaches also increase the risk of serious
infection due to simultaneous inhibition of the host immune defense against microbial pathogens.
Recent work has demonstrated that the resolution of inflammation is an active and dynamic process.
Neutrophils recruited to the infected/damaged tissue phagocytose and kill invading bacteria, undergo
apoptosis, and are cleared by macrophages (efferocytosis). Efferocytosis is a key component of the
resolution process and induces a switch from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory processes in
macrophages. This switch results in decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production, increased
production of anti-inflammatory mediators, enhanced efferocytosis, diminished neutrophil recruitment,
and promotes tissue healing and a return to homeostasis. Recently, however, another mechanism
has been described that may directly impact inflammation resolution, reverse transendothelial
migration of neutrophils (rTEM). In this mechanism, neutrophils that enter the tissue during
inflammatory responses do not die there, but rather re-enter the vasculature and travel to the lungs
before proceeding to the bone marrow where they ultimately die. This process appears to be at least
partially mediated by eicosanoids, specifically LTB4, PGE2, and LXA4. Our previous work has
demonstrated the failure of Lyme arthritis resolution in mice deficient in these inflammatory mediators.
Based upon our preliminary data, we hypothesize that neutrophils that enter tissues and encounter
microbes will remain in the tissues and undergo apoptosis there, if there are no microbes
encountered the neutrophils will undergo rTEM and exit the tissue. This proposal will investigate the
role of rTEM in inflammation resolution and the roles of LTB4, PGE2, and LXA4 in mediating this
response. Successful completion of these studies will provide new knowledge and understanding of
neutrophil trafficking during inflammation and the role of rTEM in inflammation resolution."

Our understanding of biology is being transformed by the discovery and characterization of
organelles arising from the spontaneous phase separation of proteins and RNA, in the absence
of a lipid membrane. These membraneless organelles, also called condensates, occur at different
cellular locations and can appear as solids, gels, or liquids. Dozens of distinct biomolecular
condensates are associated with pathways that regulate genes, stress response, and, and their
function depends on the types of molecules they recruit from the cellular environment. This has
spurred the interest toward developing means to harness condensation by building artificial
condensates, that could be used for separating molecules in vitro and as organelles inside living
cells. Most efforts in this direction rely on engineered proteins that include disordered domains:
this approach however is hampered by difficulties in building proteins presenting well-defined
interactions, minimal promiscuity, and limited side effects. These challenges can be addressed
by adopting engineered RNA, rather than proteins, as a building block for artificial condensates,
because specific RNA-RNA interactions are easy to program, and RNA is a molecule easily
portable across organisms presenting low toxicity.
This project aims to develop a new class of artificial condensates by taking advantage of
nanostructured RNA. We will build RNA condensates capitalizing on our recent discovery that
star-shaped RNA motifs (nanostars), comprising a single molecule of RNA, can produce dense
RNA droplets in cell-free samples and in living cells. By bridging concepts in phase separation
science and RNA nanotechnology, our project will establish RNA nanostars as a platform to build
customizable RNA organelles through different research focus areas aimed at: (1) developing
methods for sequence and structure optimization, leading to condensates with desired
thermodynamic and biophysical properties, and with specific affinity for separating guest
molecules; (2) gaining control over the location, kinetics, and composition of RNA organelles
forming inside cells; (3) establishing means to build RNA condensates that can sense and
respond to molecular signals, and explore their usefulness as sensing and imaging tools. By
providing a tunable platform to control the spatial and temporal distribution of target molecules
within living cells, our synthetic organelles will serve as a powerful tool toward achieving control
of gene expression and biosensing."

Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the most common complication during childbirth, occurring after 10% of all
deliveries, and is a significant contributor to maternal morbidity. While acute and active management of PPH is
required to prevent morbidity, pregnant individuals without anemia are better equipped to tolerate delivery-
associated blood loss without incurring morbidity. The primary cause of anemia in pregnancy is iron deficiency.
There is insufficient evidence to support universal iron deficiency screening during routine obstetric care in the
US. Currently, most individuals may only be screened for iron deficiency if they are anemic. This two-step
screening process can lead to 1) failure to diagnose iron deficiency if the patient does not undergo the secondary
work-up for anemia and 2) failure to adequately treat iron deficiency given the time it takes for oral therapy, the
historical standard treatment, to replete iron stores and its side effects that can limit regular use. Thus, innovative
strategies are needed to address iron deficiency and anemia in pregnancy, especially for the 10% of individuals
who will have a PPH and are at an increased risk for severe maternal morbidity. The primary objective of this
Phased Innovation Award (R21/R33) is to develop and test a clinical decision support (CDS) tool that proposes
a novel iron deficiency screening and management algorithm for individuals at high risk for PPH. In Phase I
(R21), structured data known at the end of the second trimester will be used to develop a machine learning-
based predictive model to identify those at high risk for PPH. We will then build a CDS tool within the electronic
health record (EHR) that will prompt providers to proactively screen and treat iron deficiency for patients at high
risk for PPH. In Phase II (R33), we will test this CDS tool’s efficacy in reducing the prevalence of anemia before
delivery via a randomized controlled trial. This phase will also monitor the acceptability of the CDS tool among
obstetric providers in the intervention group. Based at Massachusetts General Hospital, this work is led by an
experienced, multidisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in machine learning, informatics, practical
application of risk stratification tools, and clinical obstetrics. Ultimately, the proposed work seeks to improve
maternal health outcomes and accelerate the application of artificial intelligence-aided clinical tools in obstetrics
at the point of care. Specifically, it will demonstrate how a digital health tool, which uses a personalized risk
assessment, can be integrated into clinical workflows within prenatal care and offers an actionable, resource-
conscious strategy to address the ongoing public health crisis related to maternal morbidity in the US."
10951602,"This Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant proposal seeks to advance the state of the art of
pediatric diagnostic retinal imaging with a novel, auto-aligning hand-held optical coherence tomography (OCT)
and OCT angiography (OCTA) probe capable of routine and repeatable high-quality retinal structure and
angiographic imaging in infants and children. Current screening methods for pediatric retinal diseases (such as
retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)) have been shown to be stressful for these young infants and may have lifelong
neurological impact. Thus, there is a vital unmet need to develop low-stress and effective pediatric retinal
diagnostics.
 OCT is a low coherence interferometric technique that has found widespread adoption in ophthalmology
and has revolutionized the clinical care of many adult vitreoretinal diseases. Several research and commercial
hand-held probes for OCT and OCTA have previously been developed by our group and others. These portable
OCT systems have extended our fundamental knowledge of human retinal development and succeeded in
visualizing important retinal biomarkers of ROP. However, even with the most skilled operators, to acquire
consistent OCT and OCTA data capture for longitudinal follow up in uncooperative patients at the point of care
(such as infants and children) remains notoriously difficult. Therefore, both the efficiency and the quality of OCT
and OCTA data capture is hampered by the inability to achieve optimal alignment between the imaging device
and the pediatric eye.
 Our research group has pioneered the invention of robotically-aligned OCT (RAOCT) systems capable
of active tracking to compensate for subject motion. Our RAOCT systems utilizes the robot for gross alignment
to the vicinity of the eye, while an optically based, fast-steering subsystem maintains precise pupil alignment. In
this R21 project, we propose to combine our expertise in hand-held OCT/A probe development with the optical
fast-steering components of the RAOCT system (relying on the human operator only to maintain gross alignment)
to develop a novel hand-held OCT/A probe capable of stable and repeatable pediatric eye imaging.
 The expected outcomes of this proposal are a set of novel technologies capable of routine and repeatable
high-quality retinal structure and angiographic imaging of infants and children. We expect that our proposed
hand-held auto-aligning OCT/A system will provide quantifiably reproducible imaging in adult participants, and
pilot imaging in pediatric subjects."

 The most common prostate disorders, benign prostate enlargement and prostate cancer (PCa), are
associated with aging and attributed to hormonal imbalances and loss of glandular homeostasis. Given the major
impact prostate pathologies have on men’s health and their significant burden on healthcare systems, it is
important to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying prostate hyperproliferations in aging
and cancer. To date, most studies focused on elucidating the identity of various stem cell prostate populations
and on validating their stem cell potential in culture assays and tissue regeneration. Recent single cell
transcriptomics highlighted the previously underappreciated prostate epithelial heterogeneity and the importance
of lineage plasticity in generating intratumor cellular heterogeneity. To date, little is known about the functional
cell types that maintain epithelial homeostasis and what specific dysregulations enable their uncontrolled
proliferation in aging and cancer.
 In preliminary studies, we found that p63 and increased Wnt signaling mark a previously uncharacterized
prostate “luminal intermediate” (LumI) population that contributes to normal homeostatic clonal growth. These
cells and Wnt signaling appear to significantly increase in aged mouse and human prostate samples and
constitute a large proportion of PCa cells. Based on these data, we hypothesize that LumI cells and their Wnt-
p63 signaling are required for maintenance of clonal expansions in luminal layer in intact prostate, that this
“hybrid transcriptional state” expands with age and creates a pool of cells more susceptible to transformation.
Moreover, during growth of early tumor clones, the malignant cells hijack this program for rapid proliferation.
 In this application, we will investigate the role of LumI cells and their specific Wnt-p63 signaling in luminal
clonal expansions in aging and cancer with the ultimate goal of finding new targetable mechanisms that would
halt cancer progression. We will pursue this goal through three Specific Aims: 1) Functional analyses of Wnt
signaling in prostate luminal intermediate cells in aging and cancer in vivo and in vitro in prostate organoids,
2) Investigate the role of p63 in luminal plasticity in prostate cancer through loss- and gain-of-function
studies coupled with gene circuits approaches for fine tuning of p63 protein levels and lineage diversification,
and 3) Elucidate the gene regulatory network and co-factors controlled by p63 in the LumI state by
transcriptomics, epigenomics and mechanistic validation of top target genes and co-factors.
 Taken together, our studies will provide a comprehensive understanding of luminal lineage plasticity and
its effects on clonal expansions in normal, aging and malignant conditions. The proposed studies will offer
insights into novel markers for detection of progressive cancer lesions and new venues for cell-targeted cancer
therapies focused on Wnt-p63 signaling."
10945049,"Doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective chemotherapeutic drug to treat cancer. However, DOX-induced cardiotoxicity
(DICT) has limited its use. Dexrazoxane is the only current FDA-approved agent for preventing DICT, but its
cardioprotective effect is incomplete and the side effects also limit its use. Thus, the search for new
cardioprotective agents for DICT continues. SDF-1 and its receptor CXCR4 play essential roles in cardiovascular
development and diseases. Constitutive loss either one of them results in perinatal lethality partially due to
cardiac septum defects. Myocardial supplement of SDF-1 attracts stem cells that express CXCR4 to the site of
injury to promote cardiac regeneration and angiogenesis. However, their roles in cardiovascular system remain
controversial. For instance, heterozygous deletion of CXCR4 in mice reduced infarct size and CXCR4
overexpression increased infarct size and reduced cardiac function along with excessive cardiac inﬂammatory
cell infiltration. CXCR7 is a lately identified second receptor for SDF-1. CXCR7 binds SDF-1 with an affinity about
ten times higher than CXCR4 and it can either positively or negatively affect SDF-1/CXCR4 axis-mediated
functions. This raises a concern as to how to distinguish the roles of SDF-1/CXCR7 from SDF-1/CXCR4 in
cardiac protection. We showed that SDF-1 prevents cardiac lipotoxicity through CXCR7 but not CXCR4. A single-
cell RNA-seq analysis revealed the most abundant expression of CXCR7 in cardiomyocytes and cardiomyocyte-
specific CXCR7 deletion showed more prominent cardiac dysfunction after myocardial infraction, suggesting an
essential cardiac protection. Given the protective effects of CXCR7 in cardiomyocytes and the harmful effects of
CXCR4-mediated cardiac excessive inflammation, we tested the protective effects of a dual targeting compound
with specific antagonistic activity against CXCR4 and potent agonistic activity on CXCR7, against DICT. We
found this compound treatment significantly prevented DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction, cell death,
inflammation and fibrosis, along with upregulation of signals involving in cardiac energy reserve metabolic
process and downregulation of signals involving in mast cell infiltration and activation, but without affecting the
suppressive effects of DOX on tumor growth. We thus hypothesize that dual targeting compound prevents
DICT by activating cardiac CXCR7 to reprogram cardiomyocyte metabolism and prevent cardiac
dysfunction and by antagonizing CXCR4 to inhibit cardiac mast cell infiltration and activation but without
affecting the suppressive effects of DOX on tumor growth. This hypothesis will be tested through specific
aims: 1) Optimizing the protective effects against DICT in tumor-free and tumor-bearing mice; 2) Determining
whether it prevents DICT through activating CXCR7/AMPK and prevents cardiac cell death and dysfunction; 3)
Determining whether it prevents DICT through inhibiting CXCR4-mediated cardiac mast cell infiltration and
activation. Successful completion of this project will reveal new insight into the underlying mechanisms behind
and provide fundamental evidence for it as a novel approach for preventing DICT in future clinical studies."
10944172,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Integrating coverage for dually eligible Medicare-Medicaid beneficiaries (‘duals’), a population with complex
medical and social needs, is a national priority. There is substantial concern that duals in non-integrated
Medicare Advantage (MA) plans or Traditional Medicare receive ineffective, inefficient, and potentially harmful
care due to unnecessary administrative burdens, lack of financial incentives for care coordination, and plans’
perverse incentives to shift costs across bifurcated insurance programs. To address this concern, policymakers
have sought to expand integrated care plans (ICPs)—managed care plans that coordinate care and manage
both Medicare and Medicaid services for duals. However, only ~1 in 10 duals is currently enrolled in an ICP.
Furthermore, in recent years, a major threat to integration has emerged in the form of non-integrated Dual-
Eligible Special Needs Plans (D-SNP) “look-alike” plans. These “look-alike” plans primarily serve duals, but
unlike ICPs, they are not subject to federal and state requirements to provide coordinated Medicaid services. In
2023, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) instituted a new “80% rule” in which it stopped
renewing contracts with any conventional, non-integrated MA plan where 80% or more of enrollees are duals.
However, it remains unclear whether this policy will curb the growth of look-alike plans, catalyze enrollment in
ICPs (especially among high-risk duals with dementia, mental illness, frailty, and from minoritized groups, who
may disproportionately benefit from integrated coverage), or lead to meaningful improvements in quality,
equity, and outcomes. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will evaluate the impact of the CMS 80% rule on enrollment
changes of duals from look-alike plans into ICPs, and we will identify patient-, market-, and community-level
factors associated with ICP enrollment. In Aim 2, we will determine the impact of the CMS 80% rule as a
natural experiment—using a control group of plans slightly below the 80% threshold—to examine its effects on
potentially avoidable or low-value care among duals previously enrolled in look-alike plans, and between duals
who transition to ICPs vs. non-ICPs. Aim 3 will determine the impact of the 80% rule on changes in quality and
clinical outcomes among duals from look-alike plans, and among those who transitioned into ICPs vs. non-
ICPs. Across all aims, we will assess the impact of the 80% rule on a subset of high-risk duals who experience
worse quality of care at baseline and have high levels of potentially avoidable and low value health care use,
including duals with dementia, frailty, serious mental illness, complex multimorbidity, and among historically
marginalized Black and Latino people. This study will provide critical insight into the effectiveness of the CMS
policy to expand integrated care among duals, using the termination of plans above the 80% threshold as a
natural experiment. It will also inform ongoing policy efforts—including consideration of revised federal
regulation of look-alike plans—to ensure better care integration, quality, and equity of care for duals."

Obesity is a serious health concern in the United States, affecting 41.9% of the population and resulting in an
estimated annual medical cost of nearly $179 billion. Notably, obesity increases the risk of cardiovascular
diseases due to inflammation and thrombotic events. Individuals with obesity often exhibit hyper-reactive
platelets and reduced sensitivity to anti-platelet therapy, yet the mechanisms driving these altered platelet
phenotypes remain poorly understood, representing a significant knowledge gap in platelet biology. Our
preliminary data reveal that platelets from obese mice exhibit an altered lipidome that corresponds with enhanced
reactivity. Further, we previously demonstrated that platelet-generating cells, megakaryocytes (MKs), can
effectively incorporate fatty acids into their membrane, both in vivo and in vitro. However, it is unknown if and how
this uptake directly translates into alterations in platelet membrane composition in disease. As such, our central
hypothesis is that the hyper-reactive platelet phenotype observed in obesity arises from the increased
incorporation of dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs) into platelet membranes, leading to a higher membrane lipid
saturation that in turn enhances receptor accumulation within lipid rafts, ultimately augmenting platelet reactivity.
To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will unravel how fatty acid uptake influences platelet membrane composition.
Through in vitro experiments and in vivo studies utilizing high-fat diets with varying SFA concentrations, I aim to
determine whether platelets acquire fatty acids from both MKs and the plasma. Aim 2 will test the influence of
dietary SFAs on platelet reactivity and thrombus formation. By conducting in vivo studies with escalating SFA
content in diets, I will establish a direct link between dietary factors and altered platelet phenotypes. Aim 3 will
investigate whether dietary SFA-induced platelet hyper-reactivity is caused by changes in lipid raft content and
subsequent receptor signaling. My investigations will include characterizing lipid raft density and receptor
content, as well as analyzing the effects on downstream signaling both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, this proposal
aims to uncover the precise mechanisms by which dietary SFAs are integrated into platelet membranes and how
this integration influences platelet function. The main aims of this proposal are the identification of new avenues
for pharmacological interventions targeting lipid receptors in platelets or of novel dietary modifications for obese
individuals, ultimately contributing to a better management of obesity-related cardiovascular complications."

Prolonged, elevated inflammation is detrimental to health, with ties to disease and mortality, making prolonged,
elevated inflammation an economic burden and public health issue. Daily stressors and affective reactions to
daily stressors may be mechanisms that increase risk for prolonged inflammation and downstream health
outcomes. Possible pathways through which daily stressors are linked to inflammation remain poorly
understood, particularly in older adulthood– when risk for prolonged inflammation is already elevated. Although
research identifies daily stress processes (i.e., exposure, severity, affective reactions) as important factors by
which stress can affect health, few studies examine how these aspects of daily stress inform inflammation.
Those that have examined such associations have focused on middle-aged adults and two indicators of
inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin-6 [IL-6]). Recent research also identifies daily stress
processes as modifiable targets for addressing gender disparities in health outcomes. The goal of this research
is to identify which aspects of daily stress processes – frequency, severity, and affective reactions to daily
stressors – are linked with heightened inflammatory biomarkers in older adults, and the extent to which these
associations vary between men and women. The proposed research will use data from a recent wave of the
Einstein Aging Study (EAS; N=289). A racially diverse sample of older adults (70+ years) participated in a 14-
day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study, with two blood draws pre- and post- EMA period. In
addition to eight pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers assayed for both basal and stimulated cytokines, the
current proposed research will assay one additional cytokine (macrophage migration inhibitory factor [MIF]),
theorized to be highly related to psychosocial stress. Aim one will identify how the frequency and severity of
daily stressors relate to inflammatory biomarkers. Aim two will determine how both initial (same-day) and
prolonged (next-day) affective reactions relate to associations between frequency and severity of daily
stressors and inflammatory biomarkers. Aim three will examine gender/sex as a moderator of the associations
tested in aims one and two. Current interventions for managing or decreasing prolonged inflammation suggest
viable pathways such as medication, or changes in diet and exercise, but not stressors. Findings from this
study will provide critical information on what aspects of daily stress processes may be utilized as modifiable
psychosocial intervention targets for managing and decreasing prolonged inflammation, and for whom these
interventions should be different. In addition, understanding how prolonged affective reactions are linked to
inflammation can inform how researchers design intensive repeated measurement studies. The proposed
hypotheses will be tested with multilevel structural equation modeling. Dr. Witzel and co-investigators, Drs.
Jennifer Graham-Engeland and Christopher Engeland, are uniquely positioned to carry out the proposed
research given their joint expertise in daily stress processes, affect, and inflammation among older adults."

 Hazardous alcohol use is highly prevalent among the millions of older adults who have chronic pain.
This is alarming, given that hazardous drinking can exacerbate chronic pain and associated health risks and
interfere with pain treatment. Therefore, it is imperative to identify and intervene upon hazardous drinking in
older adults with chronic pain. Alcohol screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (A-SBIRT)
reduces hazardous drinking and is a promising approach to delivering early alcohol intervention within medical
settings. However, to meet the unique needs of older adults with chronic pain, A-SBIRT content needs to be
tailored to account for: salient consequences of drinking in older adults with chronic pain, including the effects
of alcohol use on pain and associated outcomes; pain as a barrier to alcohol reduction, given that older adults
frequently report drinking to cope with pain; and multimorbidity, use of opioid analgesics, and polypharmacy, all
of which are highly prevalent in older adults with chronic pain. The current lack of an A-SBIRT that is
specifically tailored for the millions of older adults with chronic pain represents a major gap in research and
clinical care. Therefore, the goal of this study is to develop, refine, and pilot test an alcohol screening, brief
intervention, and referral to treatment protocol that is tailored for older adults with chronic pain (A-SBIRT-GCP).
Our guiding hypothesis is that tailoring the protocol to meet the unique needs of older adults with chronic pain
will increase motivation/self-efficacy to reduce drinking, decrease hazardous alcohol use, and, consequently,
improve chronic pain and important aging-related outcomes. In the proposed Stage 1 work, we will: 1) develop
A-SBIRT-GCP with clinician and patient stakeholder input; 2) refine A-SBIRT-GCP using a mixed methods
open pilot trial; and 3) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of A-SBIRT-GCP in a pilot RCT. Findings from
this K23 project will inform a subsequent application for R01-level funding to conduct a Stage 2 RCT testing
the efficacy of A-SBIRT-GCP in reducing hazardous drinking and consequently improving pain and aging-
related outcomes (e.g., physical and cognitive function, quality of life) among older adults with chronic pain. If
efficacious, A-SBIRT-GCP offers great potential to be an affordable, scalable, and efficient intervention.
 The proposed work builds on the applicant’s background as a clinical psychologist with unique
expertise in chronic pain and addiction and will provide advanced mentored training in: 1) the use of qualitative
and mixed methods research; 2) the conduct of clinical trials; and 3) gerontological research. The applicant has
a multidisciplinary mentorship team of experts who are uniquely well-suited to oversee the proposed research
and training aims. In addition, the rich institutional environment at Massachusetts General Hospital and
Harvard Medical School will support the applicant in the successful completion of this project. The advanced
training and preliminary data obtained through the proposed project will propel the applicant’s transition toward
an independent, externally funded, productive gerontological research career."

Internal and external sensory processes monitor metabolic signals and subsequently promote or suppress
appetite. The parabrachial nucleus complex (PBN), composed of numerous subnuclei, is a fundamental sensory
hub important for taste processing, appetite regulation, and initiating appropriate feeding responses. While
several neuronal markers have been identified to play an important role in feeding and adaptive behaviors within
the PBN, markers that integrate the complex inputs that the PBN receives are unknown – particularly those that
can increase feeding. Furthermore, it is well-established that melanocortin receptors (MC3R and MC4R) and
their ligands, AgRP and POMC, play essential roles in regulating feeding behavior. Moreover, it has been well-
established that the melanocortin receptors (MC3R and MC4R) and their ligands, AgRP and POMC, are essential
components in regulating feeding behavior. We have identified that MC4R-expressing cells and MC4R in the
PBN lead to several profound suppressions of food and fluid, impaired fast-refeeding hyperphagia, the presence
of anxiety-induced feeding, and orosensory incoordination. These complex phenotypes illustrate the crucial role
of MC4R activation in generalized ingestive behaviors, yet the mechanisms underlying these behaviors remain
unknown. In contrast, pharmacological activation of the MC3R in the PBN directs mice to consume more food.
We know that the global deletion of the MC4R has an opposing phenotype of those observed in the global
knockout of the MC3R, illustrating that a relationship between MC3R and MC4R in the PBN to integrate opposing
ingestive behaviors is highly plausible. As a first step in testing this hypothesis, the following three aims will be
examined: 1) Defining the neuroanatomical organization of the MC4R and MC3R in the PBN, 2) Characterizing
the activity of the PBN-MC4R in appetite suppression, and finally, 3) Characterizing the activity of PBN-MC3R
neurons in consummatory behavior. To accomplish the goals of this project, Dr. Dahir will receive unparalleled
and complementary training in neuroanatomy, functional circuit analyses, and pharmacology from her mentoring
committee, Dr. Cone, Dr. Simerly, and Dr. Palmiter. The outcomes of this project will shed light on
melanocortinergic signaling within the PBN in response to ingestive behavior, ultimately contributing to the
advancement of therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, training under this K00/R00 application will provide Dr.
Dahir with the necessary technical and conceptual background to start her independent research program
focusing on the effects of sensory processes in ingestive behaviors."
10948604,"Project Summary
 Injuries to the tendon-bone attachment, or enthesis, are common and challenging to treat clinically, with
re-rupture rates of up to 94% in patients. The enthesis is composed of a special cellular and matrix composition
which is uniquely tailored to transmit force from tendon to bone, enabling movement. While the mammalian
enthesis can heal, its distinctive structure cannot be restored after injury. Even with existing treatments, healing
forms disorganized scar tissue with compromised function, leading to a higher likelihood of both re-injury and
developing joint degenerative diseases, ultimately impacting patient quality of life. As current treatment options
are limited and highly variable in efficacy, better clinical strategies are needed.
 Unlike mammals, zebrafish can fully regenerate their tendon-bone attachments. Notably, following injury,
preliminary data indicate that endogenous scleraxis a (scxa)-expressing tendon cells in zebrafish proliferate and
migrate to regenerate the enthesis, while their mammalian Scx+ counterparts remain quiescent. The
mechanisms underlying these divergent scxa/Scx+ tendon cell responses after enthesis injury remain unknown
yet may be key to redirecting fibrotic responses into regenerative outcomes in mammals.
 The goal of this proposal is to identify molecular and cellular mechanisms which control cell activation
after injury by employing a combination of multiphoton imaging, chemical, genetic, and cross-species
comparative genomic approaches in both zebrafish and mice. During the mentored K99 phase, mechanisms
that are required and sufficient for tendon cell proliferation and recruitment after enthesis injury will be identified
(Aims 1 and 2). In the independent R00 phase, Dr. Tsai will investigate the role of surrounding cell populations
in enthesis regeneration and elucidate how their injury-responsive signaling interactions with tendon cells diverge
between zebrafish and mammals to drive regeneration or scarring (Aim 3). These findings will not only uncover
instructive cues directing regenerative and fibrotic responses which may be leveraged to inspire novel strategies
to treat enthesis injuries, but also expose basic principles underlying scarring which may extend to other tissues.
The extensive training plan in the K99 phase will be conducted under the mentorship of Dr. Jenna Galloway and
co-mentor Dr. Jayaraj Rajagopal at the Center for Regenerative Medicine at MGH, a collaborative and
intellectually vibrant research community with ample opportunities for scientific and professional skill
development. In addition to boosting grant writing and leadership skills, Dr. Tsai will also acquire scientific
expertise in new areas with the aid of her advisory committee and collaborators. These include enthesis healing
and biomechanics (Dr. Elazar Zelzer, Dr. Stavros Thomopoulos), single cell ATAC-sequencing (Dr. Mansi
Shrivastava, Dr. Rajagopal), and cross-species comparative genomics (Dr. Bo Wang). Completion of this
proposal will thus strongly position Dr. Tsai to build and lead a state-of-the-art independent research program."

This proposal for a Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award (K08) outlines a
comprehensive training program for the career development of the applicant Dr. Prajwal Boddu as an
independent physician scientist. The focus of scientific investigation is myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), the
most common cause of bone marrow failure in adults. Mutations in well-defined groups of genes (splicing factors,
epigenetic regulators) underlie most MDS. SF3B1 mutations are most common among splicing factors,
accounting for about 20% of MDS cases. Conventional models assign disruption of alternative splicing to be the
primary cause of splicing factor mutant MDS, but many limitations to these studies have prompted alternate
hypotheses. In this application, we consider an additional context in which splicing factors function – specifically,
their role in the regulation of RNA transcription. Given the close interplay between RNA transcription and splicing,
we explored how SF3B1 mutations affect transcription kinetics. Our studies show that SF3B1 mutations disrupt
RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) transcription, leading to a profound reshaping of chromatin architecture, and yielding
targetable epigenetic modifications. Consequently, we redefine SF3B1-mutant MDS functionally as an epigenetic
disorder. Based on these preliminary results, this proposal will delve into the molecular mechanisms that link
SF3B1 mutations to Pol II elongation defects and altered chromatin accessibility. The first aim will explore a novel
hypothesis that mutant SF3B1 impairs early spliceosome assembly, affecting Pol II density at gene promoters,
ultimately leading to chromatin closure and altered gene expression. The second aim will investigate the impact
of these transcription defects on higher order chromatin (3D genome). Recent studies have pointed to the link
between 3D genome reorganization and clonal evolution and aberrant gene expression patterns in many clonal
processes. The third aim seeks to leverage data from an unbiased screen that shows reversal of transcription
defects through inhibition of chromatin modulators such as those in the Sin3/HDAC complex. Using patient
derived xenograft (PDX) models, we will explore therapeutic targeting of these chromatin modulators. The
application seeks to expand the principal investigator’s training in RNA splicing, transcription biology, and
epigenetics under the mentorship of Dr. Manoj Pillai, a physician scientist with expertise in RNA mechanisms
and hematopoiesis, alongside co-mentor Dr. Karla Neugebauer, a pioneer in the field of co-transcriptional
splicing. Additional expertise will be provided by an advisory committee comprising of Drs Andrew Xiao
(epigenetics) and Amit Verma (patient-derived xenograft modeling and pre-clinical studies of MDS). Yale
University provides exceptional opportunities for both training and career development for aspiring physician
scientists such as Dr. Boddu. A carefully designed career development plan will include didactic coursework and
career mentorship to complement the rigorous hands-on scientific training."

Dr. Minjee Kim is a practicing neurologist with expertise in sleep research and clinical assessment of cognitive
impairment (CI). Her long-term goal is to become an independent investigator studying: (1) the role of sleep as
a potentially modifiable determinant of CI, Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); (2) the design of
health system interventions for the early detection and treatment of sleep disturbance (SD) to mitigate CI/ADRD
risk. The career development plan proposes to fill critical gaps in her skills through formal and informal training
in aging research, data science, and health system interventions. This award will ensure she has the knowledge,
skills, and experience to conduct in-depth investigations, lead pragmatic clinical trials, and translate research
findings into routine clinical care. Dr. Kim has convened an outstanding mentoring team with complementary
expertise in sleep, cognitive aging, health system interventions, pragmatic trials, data science, biostatistics, and
primary care. Northwestern University offers Dr. Kim an exceptional environment, with dedicated resources from
the Department of Neurology, Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine, Center for Applied Health Research on
Aging, Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center, and Clinical and Translational Sciences
Institute to support her research, career development, and transition to independent clinical investigation.
 SD refers to manifestations of poor sleep health, including inadequate duration, inappropriate timing, irregular
pattern, low efficiency, unsatisfactory quality, and daytime sleepiness. Many forms of SD can be effectively
addressed in primary care, yet SD remains largely undetected in clinical settings. SD is common in later life and
has been linked to CI/ADRD risk. Yet less is known about SD in middle age (MA). As clinically meaningful
cognitive decline is believed to present during MA, more research is needed that examines midlife determinants
of cognitive decline that could be targets of interventions. If identified early, SD in midlife may be modifiable with
immediate benefits on physical and mental health, and might possibly reduce later life risk of CI/ADRD.
 To address this, Dr. Kim has added new sleep measures (actigraphy, sleep diary, questionnaires) to a new
NIA cohort study investigating cognitive function among middle-aged adults (‘MidCog’; PI: Wolf) explicitly for
this proposal. Leveraging the MidCog study and linked electronic health records (EHR) data, Dr. Kim will
investigate associations between SD, cognitive function, self-care capacity, and health status (Aim 1), and then
apply machine learning to develop SD prediction models from EHR data (Aim 2). In Aim 3, Dr. Kim will adapt
and pilot test an EHR-embedded primary care strategy for routine detection of SD, guided by the SD prediction

Aging involves a gradual clinical decline in cognitive and physical function and often the development of
various comorbidities. However, significant life events, such as cancer diagnosis and treatment, can potentially
accelerate clinical decline and aging. Various individual-level and neighborhood-level social determinants of
health (SDOH) can also accelerate aging in cancer survivors, but a comprehensive approach to identifying and
intervening on multilevel aging risk factors for cancer survivors is lacking. To investigate multilevel aging risk
factors, a reliable measure is needed to quantify aging and monitor dynamic changes in aging-related health
status over time. An electronic deficit accumulation index (eDAI) measures aging-related clinical declines over
time by counting the accumulation of aging-related deficits using electronic health records (EHRs). However,
the eDAI in cancer research has primarily been used at the time of diagnosis to manage comorbidity and
reduce treatment toxicity, but it has been understudied in the context of cancer survivorship and aging
trajectories. The broad goal of this project is to evaluate dynamic changes in aging-related clinical decline in
cancer survivors using eDAI through real-world data analytics, identify multilevel determinants associated with
SDOH disparities in clinical decline, and highlight potential interventions for healthy aging. Lung cancer is an
ideal disease setting for achieving these goals. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, with a
median age at diagnosis of 71 years. With recent increases in survival due to screening and new treatment
paradigms, this disease is becoming a chronic disease of older age. More importantly, while cancer survivors
are traditionally defined as people who survive long after treatment completion, many lung cancer patients live
for a long time while still undergoing active treatment, highlighting the importance of longitudinal exposures to
treatment or other time-varying risk factors on aging. Given that aging is also an evolving process, studying
dynamic longitudinal risk factors for aging in lung cancer survivors could serve as a useful model in aging
epidemiologic research. The study cohort will comprise >89,000 survivors (age≥65) with early-stage non-small
cell lung cancer who are healthy (i.e., including both robust [eDAI<0.2] and pre-clinical decline [eDAI: 0.2-
0.34]) at diagnosis in SEER-Medicare (2013-2017). The primary outcome will be the time to clinical decline
(eDAI≥0.35). The aims are (AIM 1) to identify key individual-level risk factors affecting clinical decline, (AIM 2)
to investigate neighborhood-level SDOH to develop a comprehensive risk prediction model for clinical decline,
and (AIM 3) to conduct real-world validation using an integrated EHR database of academic and community
healthcare systems. Completing these research aims and training goals (in real-world data analytics, SDOH
disparities, and aging epidemiology) under the strong mentorship team in Stanford’s rich environment will be
critical for me to become an independent investigator at the intersection of aging, cancer survivorship, and
disparities with key skills for the era of expanding real-world big data and comprehensive disparities research."
10948951,"Viral respiratory infections, such as influenza and SARS-CoV2, frequently lead to acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a condition with a mortality up to 46%. Endothelial injury,
dysfunction and the resultant vascular hyperpermeability contribute to the severity of ARDS,
persistence of lung injury, and dysregulated repair with the development of fibrosis. While
sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) is a key protective signaling axis on endothelial
cells, the role of S1PR1 signaling in the resolution of lung injury in post-viral ARDS has not been
well explored.
The objective of this application is to define endothelial S1PR1-dependant pathways which
promote the re-alveolarization of the post-viral lung needed to prevent morbid fibrotic outcomes.
We hypothesize that endothelial S1PR1 signaling promotes productive lung repair after viral
infection via BMP2 mediated support of the epithelial niche. These preliminary findings a new
facet to the pleotropic benefits of EC S1PR1 beyond its established role in limiting vascular
hyperpermeability and highlight a need to comprehensively validate the therapeutic potential of
augmenting S1PR1 expression to limit post-viral pulmonary fibrosis. We will test this hypothesis
via two specific aims: 1) determine the mechanism of endothelial S1PR1 mediated epithelial
repair after viral-induced ARDS, and 2) determine how EC S1PR1 regulation can be
therapeutically augmented to attenuate post-viral fibrosis. The proposed research will reveal novel
links between EC S1PR1 and epithelial regeneration and differentiation after viral infection and
identify regulators of endothelial function which can be therapeutically targeted to attenuate post-
viral fibrosis.
Dr. Brazee’s long-term goal is to be an independent basic and translational investigator with a
research program aimed at understanding the contributions of the endothelium in supporting
productive lung repair pathways. The proposed K01 research aims utilize prior training in mouse
models of influenza virus infection, fibrotic lung disease, and fundamental molecular biology
techniques. In addition, the project will necessitate advanced training in vascular and epithelial
biology, G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, and translational modeling of human
disease using human derived 3D organoids and precision cut lung slices. Successful completion
of these aims, together with continued professional development, will provide the proficiencies
necessary to establish a productive research program and an impactful career as an independent
R01-funded investigator."
10949467,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Proteins are the molecules that carry out the majority of biological function. Although mRNA levels can be
measured at scale and have been transformative for understanding gene expression in large cohorts, mRNA
levels correlate only partially with protein levels in a system. As a result, some differentially expressed genes
from transcriptomics experiments may not be informative for the abundance of their proteins, leaving their
functional significance difficult to interpret and leading to a loss of information that impedes the translation of
`omics' experiments to biological knowledge. The recent availability of large matching transcriptomics and
proteomics data has created new avenues to predict protein level changes from mRNA profiles using machine
learning methods. Results from these efforts have highlighted the prevalence of post-transcriptional regulation
of the proteome, where the abundance of a protein species in a sample is often determined not only by its own
coding mRNA, but the abundance of other mRNAs in the transcriptomes, including many of those coding for
its protein-protein interaction partners. Accordingly, this project aims to explore new strategies that capture
protein-protein relationships to enhance our current capability to infer protein-level changes from mRNA
abundance measurements. Specifically, Aim 1 will explore the use of conceptual embeddings of proteins to
create low-dimension vectors that capture relevant protein information on: (1) the topology of protein-protein
interaction network measured in large mass spectrometry experiments, and (2) protein sequence, domain, and
structure information; and then evaluate their utility for capturing the relevant protein neighborhoods that aid in
the prediction of proteomic changes from mRNA abundance. In parallel, Aim 2 will aim to disseminate
technological advances by building enabling software tools and web apps that will take the pre-trained models
to analyze new user input mRNA sequencing results, which are designed to assist in the prioritization and
interpretation of gene lists from sequencing experiments. The models will be validated by mass spectrometry
and immunoblot experiments. If successful, the proposed work will lead to broadly applicable software tools
that can enhance the utility and interpretation of transcriptomics and proteomics experiments. It may also yield
new insights into the biological factors that contribute to non-correlation between mRNA and proteins."
10949362,"ABSTRACT
A small number of conserved signaling pathways are key players in cell fate decisions that govern embryonic
development, maintenance and health of adult tissues, and progression of disease states. For example,
embryonic development in numerous species hinges on the dynamics and regulation of the BMP signaling
pathway. Our current knowledge of BMP signaling pathway specificity is based upon foundational genetic and
in vitro experiments, but we have limited understanding as to how cells produce diverse but specific responses
to similar signaling inputs in vivo. In the Drosophila embryo, a steep gradient of BMP signaling is dynamically
established prior to gastrulation. This gradient is interpreted by different populations of cells to establish the
dorsal-ventral axis of the embryo, with cells at the dorsal midline turning on a unique set of transcripts compared
to more lateral cells. We do not know how the dynamics of gradient formation and the final gradient pattern are
interpreted by cohorts of cells in the embryo to produce the correct spatiotemporal transcriptional response.
This study aims to shed light on how cells perceive and respond to varying BMP signaling inputs, with the goal
that these discoveries will be broadly applicable to other biological contexts. The proposed research program
employs cutting-edge quantitative live imaging techniques, the creation of predictive mathematical models, and
the adaptation of tools for studying BMP signaling in diverse insect species. Specifically, I will develop a
predictive model for BMP target gene transcription that can correlate BMP signaling dynamics with timing and
spatial patterns of gene expression. Second, I will examine crosstalk between BMP signaling and EGFR/ERK
signaling by developing live imaging approaches and applying quantitative methods. Finally, I will expand the
research scope by building tools to examine BMP signaling dynamics in the red flour beetle, Tribolium
casteneum. By leveraging the unique characteristics of Tribolium, such as slower development and distinct
embryonic tissue architecture, I will elucidate how the conserved BMP signaling pathway adapts and functions
across species. The proposed multi-faceted approach, ranging from mathematical modeling to cross-species
comparisons, promises to unveil fundamental principles of cell signaling and provide a foundation for further
advancements in developmental biology and translational applications. To accomplish these goals, I have
formed an exceptional committee of advisors who can aid in my diverse approach to understanding signaling
dynamics in vivo. Together with my advisor, Dr. Stefano Di Talia, I have designed a training plan that will provide
me with the skills required to run a productive, independent laboratory that tackles complex questions about
the role of conserved signaling in developmental biology."
10949934,"Increased macrophage infiltration is associated with poorest outcome following neoadjuvant chemotherapy
(CTX) in patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). In contrast patients with increased tumor infiltrating
lymphocytes (TILs) and fewer macrophages achieve a favorable pathological complete response (pCR). In the
metastatic setting macrophages continue to accumulate to promote tumor survival and play a key role in
therapeutic resistance. In order to understand the synergism between macrophages and tumor cells within the
Tumor Immune Microenvironment (TIME), it is essential to have appropriate immunocompetent preclinical TNBC
models that represent the high Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal (EMT)/ Macrophage phenotype observed in patients
with a poor prognosis. We have developed and extensively characterized several genetically engineered mouse
models that lack the p53 tumor suppressor gene that is most frequently lost or mutated in TNBC. These “claudin
low” models closely phenocopy the high EMT/macrophage subtype observed in patients. However, because
metastasis is the cause of mortality in the vast majority of TNBC patients, the critical question remains of whether
macrophage targeted therapies can alter the TIME leading to long-term antitumor immunity in lung and liver
metastases. Therefore, we hypothesize that therapeutic pressures applied on tumor and immune cells cause
alterations to the TIME of lung and liver metastases generating subclonal populations that can lead to resistance
and recurrence via the presence of Intratumoral Heterogeneity (ITH). We propose to spatially profile the
metastatic TIME of lung and liver metastases following, anti-CSF1R (SNDX-ms6352) with CTX and newly
approved anti-PD1 in order to identify mechanisms of resistance that lead to ITH. Further we will explore if
targeting existing metastasis can recruit TILs including antigen presenting dendritic, B and T cells and convert
“cold” tumors “hot” leading to a durable antitumor long-term response. To perform these studies we will directly
introduce unlabeled tumor cells into the lung via tail vein injection or into the liver via the portal vein. Mice will be
randomized and administered 4 weekly treatments of CTX with anti-CSF1R and anti-PD1. BrdU will be injected
to detect lung and liver metastases. Spatial transcriptomics, Imaging mass cytometry, single cell RNA-
sequencing, and flow cytometry, will be utilized to confirm macrophage depletion and study mechanisms of
resistance within the metastatic TIME. Characterization of the lung and liver TIME in these preclinical models
will be compared to results from matched metastasis in the AURORA clinical trial. We will then interrogate newly
identified signaling mechanisms via genetic manipulation (RNAi and CRISPR) and potential small molecule
inhibitors and analyze downstream signaling pathways by immunoblotting and qPCR. Novel gene signatures
observed will be used to identify potential resistant human breast cancer cell lines in order to study signaling
mechanisms in vitro. Our preliminary results demonstrate that targeting macrophages enhances chemotherapy
and ICB efficacy in treating established lung metastasis via the activation of the TIME."
10946474,"Project Summary/Abstract
Our long-term objective is to understand how neural circuits in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)
support adaptive choice behavior and produce choice biases, particularly those pertinent to
drug abuse disorders. Our central hypothesis is that distinct OFC output neuron types encode
unique decision variables and contribute to specific choice biases. This project has two main
goals: to map the OFC neurons projecting to subcortical areas and then to study their role in
decision-making by monitoring and manipulating their activity. In Aim 1, we will examine
whether functional clusters of OFC neurons correspond to specific decision-making
processes and whether their representations are stable over time and across different tasks.
In Aim 2, we will comprehensively map OFC subcortical projections, and test if neurons
projecting different regions are anatomically and molecularly distinct. Then we will focus on
OFC projection neurons to the ventral striatum and the ventral tegmental area and use
projection-targeted miniscope imaging to identify their roles in decision-making algorithms. In
Aim 3, we will manipulate these projections to test whether they mediate specific choice
biases based on past outcomes and reward size, respectively. Upon completing these aims,
we expect to provide a blueprint for how decision variables are computed within the OFC and
transmitted to its subcortical targets in a projection-specific manner and drive different choice
biases."
10944286,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Escherichia coli species encompass innocuous commensals, resident pathobionts, and invading
pathogens. In the gut, the proliferation of E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae, and their potential to induce or
contribute to disease, is dependent on the reduction or complete loss of colonization resistance. Host,
microbial, and environmental factors can all contribute to lowering colonization resistance to facilitate
Enterobacteriaceae expansion, which represents a common hallmark of microbiome dysfunction in many
chronic diseases including Crohn’s disease. Supported by our extensive preliminary data, this proposal will
define a novel mechanism by which a host signaling network – the endocannabinoid system – lowers
colonization resistance by releasing otherwise unavailable nutrients that stimulate proliferation of gut E. coli
pathobionts and Enterobacteriaceae pathogens. Using mouse models of enteric infection and of pathobiont-
exacerbated Crohn’s disease, as well as a combination of host and bacterial genetics, targeted metabolomics,
gnotobiology, and pharmacological manipulations, this proposal outlines an innovative approach to: 1) evaluate
the temporal and spatial effects of host endocannabinoid activity on Enterobacteriaceae niche formation in the
gut and consequent effects on disease; and 2) define the nutrients and bacterial metabolic pathways that
support Enterobacteriaceae expansion stimulated by increased host endocannabinoid activity. These studies
are particularly pressing considering the ongoing efforts to develop the endocannabinoid system as a
therapeutic target for managing debilitating symptoms that are commonly reported in chronic inflammatory
diseases."
10944800,"Project Summary
 Charge detection mass spectrometry (CD-MS) is an emerging technology that allows accurate mass
distributions to be measured for heterogeneous and high mass samples. It is a single ion approach where the
mass to charge ratio (m/z) and charge are measured simultaneously for each ion, and then multiplied to give the
ion’s mass. Measurements are performed for thousands of ions, which are then binned into a mass distribution.
The m/z ratio and charge are measured using a detection cylinder embedded in an electrostatic linear ion trap
(ELIT). Trapped ions oscillate back and forth through the detection cylinder and the signal from the oscillating
ions is detected by a charge sensitive amplifier. The oscillation frequency gives the m/z ratio, and the charge is
obtained from the signal amplitude. CD-MS is early enough in its development cycle that substantial technical
improvements are still occurring. In this project we address the two main limitations of CD-MS: 1) its moderate
resolving power, and 2) the relatively long time needed to measure a spectrum. The mass resolving power is
limited by the precision of the m/z determination. The best m/z resolving power reported to date is 700. Using
computer simulations, we have designed ELITs with resolving powers over 300,000. However, to perform at this
level, the ELITs need to be perfectly aligned. Computer simulations indicate we can overcome the alignment
problem by segmenting some of the ELIT electrodes and applying slightly different voltages to the segments to
recover the high resolution. Our second goal is to substantially reduce the time needed to measure a spectrum.
To achieve this goal, we will a) reduce the trapping time needed to resolve charge states, and b) reduce ion-ion
interactions so that more ions can be trapped and measured at the same time. The trapping time required for
charge state resolution can be reduced by lowering electrical noise, which will be achieved by implementing a
novel design for the charge sensitive amplifier. Ion-ion interactions will be reduced by optimizing ELIT designs
so that ions are trapped in trajectories that do not interact. Combining these advances, we expect to perform
high-resolution CD-MS measurements at 500-1000 ions/s. The advances described above will be transformative
for CD-MS and are expected to have a broad impact. We will explore three applications. 1) high resolution CD-
MS analysis of the adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy vectors will reveal subpopulations with different
combinations of capsid proteins. The subpopulation relative abundances, and any correlations with post
translational modifications, may help understand lot-to-lot variability in AAV preparations. 2)
Heteroaryldihydropyrimidines (HAPs) lead to aberrant assembly of hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsids, and they are
being investigated as potential HBV antivirals. High resolution CD-MS measurements will be performed to
monitor HAP binding to HBV capsids and assembly intermediates to probe the nature of the binding interactions.
3) To explore the use of high resolution and high throughput CD-MS to detect and monitor biomarkers, we will
use CD-MS to measure intact urinary proteins to determine how many can be directly detected."
10869913,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Studies utilizing the murine model of lung transplantation have helped advance our understanding 
of lung allograft-specific immunoregulation. Unlike other solid organs, the lung relies on pro-inflammatory feedback loops for establishing and maintaining graft acceptance. We have 
described that CD8+ T cells, long considered deleterious to solid organ allograft survival, play a 
critical role in lung allograft tolerance. During the last funding period we have uncovered that 
lung-resident eosinophils, also considered a detrimental cell population for graft health, shape 
CD8+ T cell fate to prevent their effector differentiation. We have also described that such 
eosinophil-CD8+ T cell feedback loops play a crucial role in maintaining graft survival in vivo. We 
have further demonstrated the translational potential of this discovery and ameliorated graft 
rejection by altering eosinophil migration into the lung through intra-tracheal administration of 
chemokines. Such data provides proof of principle that mechanistic studies utilizing murine 
models offer the possibility for the development of lung-specific protocols for immunosuppression 
and tolerance induction. In project #2 we propose to decipher multiple aspects of lung allograft-specific proinflammatory loops in tolerance induction and maintenance. In aim #1 we plan to 
explore the interactions of IFN-γ and IL1-β in lung allograft acceptance and in aim #2 we will focus 
on antigen specificity in tolerance induction as well as mechanism/s mediating T cell receptor 
instability. In aim #3 we will focus on the role of PD-L1 in maintenance of tolerance. In addition
we will explore the potential for bi-specific antibody-mediated induction of tolerance through 
forced interaction of eosinophils and T cells. The studies proposed here would lay the foundation 
for translational large animal and human work in lung allograft management in an effort to improve 
survival."

Mitochondrial signal transduction is an emerging biological pathway linking adverse psychosocial exposures to
disease risk. However, we lack scalable, sensitive, and biologically meaningful markers to explore the role of
mitochondrial biology in the stress-disease cascade. We have identified blood cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cf-
mtDNA) as a stress-inducible marker, discovered the existence of cf-mtDNA in saliva, and developed a scalable
laboratory platform (MitoQuicLy) to quantify cf-mtDNA from thousands of samples in various biofluids. Building
on these discoveries, in Aim 1 we will deploy MitoQuicLy to profile cf-mtDNA dynamics across >5,800 blood and
saliva samples from three laboratory socio-evaluative stress studies. Building on the existing deep phenotyping
across these cohorts, these new measurements of cf-mtDNA dynamics, including built-in validation across
cohorts, will provide robust estimates of cf-mtDNA reactivity effect sizes, sex differences, baseline psychosocial
and mental health correlates including anxiety and depressive symptoms, and cortisol – a putative driver of cf-
mtDNA dynamics. Two studies include experimental or quasi-experimental manipulations of systemic energy
metabolism and mitochondrial health, providing an opportunity to examine the influence of mitochondrial
energetics on cf-mtDNA reactivity. In Aim 2, we will generate the first comprehensive human psychosocial stress
proteome using aptamer-based technology proteomics to quantify ~6,100 circulating proteins. With this dataset,
we will define when and how much known proteins increase, decrease, or are unchanged following socio-
evaluative stress, providing a high-resolution map of systemic molecular recalibrations. This will show how the
human brain-body system as a whole responds to acute mental stress, potentially providing new cues about the
interplay of metabolic, immune, endocrine, digestive, and other systems under stress. Using this exciting new
dataset, we will identify functionally relevant families of proteins i) that precede and statistically predict peak cf-
mtDNA reactivity, ii) that are co-released and follow the same quantitative dynamic trajectory as cf-mtDNA, and
iii) that follow the peak of cf-mtDNA reactivity and represent potential systemic consequences of cf-mtDNA
signaling. In Aim 3 we apply a combination of sensitive molecular and biochemical approaches to define the
molecular nature of cf-mtDNA in humans. Building on recent work demonstrating that cf-mtDNA does not
circulate as naked DNA fragments but rather as encapsulated cargo in extracellular vesicles, we will profile the
size, density, morphology, molecular composition, and functional characteristics of cf-mtDNA subtypes. To gain
further insight into the distinct forms of human cf-mtDNA, their potential origin, and functional physiological
significance in the stress-disease cascade, we will deploy these approaches to well-controlled baseline samples,
as well as post-stress samples at cf-mtDNA peak reactivity. These large-scale and molecular experiments will
generate foundational knowledge to develop new mitochondrial markers for stress and mental health research."

PD1 and LAG3 play critical roles in regulating T cell tolerance and autoimmunity. Combined genetic deficiency 
of PD1 and LAG3 in mice results in lethal systemic autoimmunity, demonstrating PD1/LAG3 synergies in 
tolerance. The goal of Project 1 is to determine mechanisms by which PD1 and LAG3 control Treg and selfreactive CD4+ FoxP3– T cells in tolerance and autoimmunity. These are issues of fundamental and clinical 
significance, as PD1 and LAG3 are key mediators of T cell exhaustion and promising therapeutic targets, and 
there is a growing appreciation of immune-related adverse events in cancer patients treated with checkpoint 
blockade. A deeper understanding of how PD1 and LAG3 work together to mediate tolerance may enable optimal
effective PD1 and LAG3 cancer therapies, while minimizing autoimmunity. In contrast to exacerbated EAE in 
Pdcd1–/– mice, our preliminary data show that mice lacking PD1 in Treg develop ameliorated EAE. Conversely,
LAG3 deletion in Treg increased EAE severity, while combined PD1/LAG3 deletion in Treg reduced EAE. These 
findings highlight the need to determine how PD1/LAG3 signals are integrated in different cell types to 
understand how perturbing these pathways impacts protective Treg and pathogenic self-reactive CD4+ FoxP3– T 
cells. Based on these data, we hypothesize that synergy between PD1 and LAG3 operates by cellular and 
molecular mechanisms that differ in Treg and CD4+ FoxP3– T cells to control pathogenic and protective responses 
during EAE initiation and progression. We will test this hypothesis by clinical, cellular, and molecular analyses of 
a) novel inducible knockout mice where PD1 and/or LAG3 can be temporally deleted only in Treg cells or only in 
CD4+ Foxp3– T cells and b) mice given PD1 and/or LAG3 blocking antibodies. We will evaluate select targets 
from our studies to define mechanisms by which PD1/LAG3 coordinate to control cell fate and function. Aim 1:
What cellular and molecular events are triggered in Treg and self-reactive CD4+ FoxP3– T cells by PD1/ LAG3 
deletion or blockade during EAE onset? We hypothesize that PD1/LAG3 interactions have distinct effects on Treg
vs. CD4+ FoxP3– T cells during EAE initiation. We will define how PD1 and/or LAG3 deletion affects self-reactive 
CD4+ Foxp3– T cell activation/differentiation and Treg activation/function, and integrated effects of LAG3/PD1 
blockade. Aim 2: What cellular and molecular events are triggered in Treg and self-reactive CD4+ Foxp3– effector
(Teff) cells by PD1/LAG3 deletion or blockade after EAE onset? We predict that PD1/LAG3 interactions may differ 
in initiation vs. effector phases of EAE, since PD1 can regulate T cell differentiation fates and effector responses. 
We will define how PD1 and/or LAG3 deletion impacts Teff and Treg cells and integrated effects of PD1/LAG3 
blockade. Project 1 will collaborate with Projects 2 and 3 to compare effects of PD1/LAG3 disruption in tolerance
and T cell exhaustion: CD4+ FoxP3– T cells in EAE vs. cancer (Project 2), and CD4+ Teff in EAE vs. CD8+ T cells 
in cancer (Project 2) and chronic infection (Project 3). Project 1 will interact with Core A to exchange data, Core 
B to obtain unique mouse strains, Core C for transcriptional analyses, and Core D for immunopathology studies."
10950692,"Abstract
Ensuring a world safe from microbial threats is a pressing challenge, as outbreaks exact tolls on human health, disrupt regional security, and have the potential to rapidly escalate into global crises. In recent years, severe outbreaks of Ebola, Lassa, Zika, and other emerging viruses have illustrated how vulnerable the world is to threats from RNA viral pathogens. These public health emergencies have exposed the urgent need for improved infrastructure, scientific knowledge, and diagnostic tools in areas of the world most at risk, and underscore the need for proactive pathogen surveillance, detection, and discovery. West Africa has a disproportionate vulnerability to outbreaks, but we lack awareness of acute threats, their natural history, and effective strategies for prevention. Rooted research between local and global partners, combined with novel assays and strategies for pandemic preparedness is required to answer these questions. We will build the capacity to rapidly respond to future outbreaks by establishing the West African Research Network for Infectious Diseases. This network will expand on years of successful cross-disciplinary research and capacity building, bringing together leading researchers from the United States, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone. We will: (1) perform comprehensive surveys of acute RNA viral disease and determine critical threats circulating in hosts and reservoirs; (2) identify risk factors of virus transmission and evolution; (3) dissect pathogenesis and natural history of severe RNA viral diseases; and (4) determine diagnostic criteria for infection outcome to guide public health interventions. Our work will significantly expand research capacity in West Africa via technology development of novel solutions for surveillance, diagnostics, and pathogen discovery. By establishing our network with a focus on priority pathogen research, technology transfer, training, and capacity building, we will develop flexible strategies for detecting, mitigating, and preventing the emergence of future infectious disease outbreaks."
10948415,"Substance use disorders comprise chronic cycles of drug use, abstinence, and relapse driven by drug-induced
transcriptional and circuit adaptations in the brain. Despite consistent evidence that epigenetic chromatin
modifications drive these long-term neuronal adaptations, successful druggable treatment targets have not
emerged, and further understanding of mechanistic pathways from the epigenome to altered behavior are
needed for novel substance use disorder therapies. This proposal examines the link between epigenetic
processes, including histone deacetylase (HDAC) function and chromatin accessibility, and mitochondrial
morphology and function in the context of nicotine reinforcement learning to bridge this gap. Use of nicotine, the
primary psychoactive component of both tobacco and e-cigarettes, alters brain reward pathways, including inputs
to spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). The subsequent transcriptional and
morphological changes in these SPNs support electrophysiological activity driving cue-induced craving and drug-
seeking behaviors that make smoking cessation difficult and contribute to nicotine use disorder. Understanding
how drugs such as nicotine induce lasting molecular adaptations and alter the functioning of NAc SPNs is critical
in untangling the local mechanisms promoting persistent drug use and relapse. SPN mitochondria stand out as
an unexplored but likely regulator of NAc SPN adaptations to nicotine, mediating plasticity downstream of
epigenetic genome modifications. This proposal uses cutting edge cell-type selective techniques to examine how
both nicotine and HDAC inhibitors alter mitochondrial morphology and function, as well as individual SPN gene
expression and chromatin accessibility, to provide a new mechanistic understanding of nicotine-reward. Using a
mouse model of nicotine intravenous self-administration (IVSA) and drug seeking, I will measure NAc
mitochondrial respiratory capacity then will assess dendritic, spine, and mitochondrial morphology in the two
main SPN populations in NAc (D1- and D2-dopamine receptor containing SPNs). I will also examine these end
points after inhibition of multiple classes of HDACs, determining if nicotine’s effects on mitochondria are related
to nicotine’s function as an HDAC inhibitor. Parallel single nuclei RNA and ATAC sequencing will identify
molecular adaptations in individual NAc cell types after nicotine IVSA. Finally, after identifying and validating
molecular targets regulating transcriptional programs within in SPN cell types, I will disrupt the endogenous
mitochondria adaptations to IVSA nicotine with cell-type selective CRISPR activation or interference (CRISPRa/i)
manipulations. These studies will inform the relationship between drug-induced epigenetic modifications and
downstream mitochondrial functioning, a potential intermediary to morphological and electrophysiological
plasticity in response to rewarding drugs. In addition to providing training opportunities in mitochondrial and
transcriptional profiling this proposal will provide new insights into mechanisms of nicotine use and relapse,
which may translate to other used substances and inform novel substance use disorder therapeutics."

 Alcohol abuse increases the host risk of developing serious infections, particularly septicemia/sepsis.
Neutrophil granulocytes constitute the first line of phagocytic defense against bacterial pathogens. Our recent
studies have demonstrated that activation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is crucial for enhancing
granulocyte production by bone marrow in response to bacterial infection. Alcohol impairs this critical step of
the granulopoietic response. Currently, knowledge about the underlying mechanisms remains limited.
Guanylate-binding protein 7 (GBP7) is a member of the 65KDa large cytokine inducible GTPase family. Little is
known about the function of GBP7 in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Our pilot studies revealed
that GBP7 expression by HSPCs was markedly upregulated at both mRNA and protein levels in mice with E.
coli septicemia. This increase in GBP7 expression was accompanied by activation of HSPCs. Chronic plus
binge alcohol administration suppressed the upregulation of GBP7 expression along with inhibition of HSPC
activation during E. coli septicemia. Searching promoter regions of murine and human GBP7 genes showed
multiple Fos/Jun binding sites. Alcohol suppressed activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK1/2) in marrow
cells during septicemia. Inhibition of JNK1/2 activation with specific inhibitor suppressed lipopolysaccharide-
induced up-regulation of GBP7 expression by HSPCs. The predominant distribution of GBP7 was detected in
nuclei of HSPCs from both murine and human origins. Septic stimuli caused a marked enhancement of GBP7
expression in the nuclei of HSPCs, which implied a close association of GBP7 with the change in nuclear
activity. GBP activation leads to their conformational changes facilitating interaction of these large GTPases
with different macromolecules to form complexes for carrying out different functions in cells. Cyclin D1-cyclin-
dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 signaling drives HSPC proliferation. Septicemia caused a marked increase in
cyclin D1 expression and enhancement of proliferation in HSPCs, both of which were suppressed by alcohol or
GBP7 knockout (KO). GBP7 KO impaired marrow granulopoietic response, which was similar to what caused
by alcohol intoxication. Our current project proposes to explore the role of GBP7 in the regulation of HSPC
activation and investigate how alcohol impairs it. The central hypothesis is that alcohol inhibits GBP7 signaling
for HSPC activation during the granulopoietic response to septic infection. Two specific aims are: 1) to
examine if alcohol suppresses up-regulation of GBP7 expression by HSPCs via inhibiting activation of the toll-
like receptor (TLR) 4-JNK1/2-Fos/Jun pathway in response to septic infection; 2) to determine if alcohol inhibits
HSPC activation during the granulopoietic response via impairing GBP7-cyclin D1-CDK4/6 signaling. Results
obtained from this exploratory investigation will greatly advance our knowledge about the defect of immune
defense against serious infection in alcohol abusers. It will also identify key targets for further developing novel
therapeutic interventions to treat fatal infection and sepsis in these immunocompromised hosts."

 Use of human laboratory analogues of drinking behavior can provide an efficient, cost-effective mechanistic
evaluation of a medication signal on drinking, with the result of facilitating translational work in medication
development. Existing human laboratory models have yet to focus on important FDA-endpoints for alcohol use
disorder (AUD) medication approval or World Health Organization (WHO) Risk criteria for clinical trial
investigations. To this end, we are proposing to continue to develop a novel alcohol self-administration
paradigm which models both the 1) ability to resist drinking and 2) heavy drinking. To model the ‘ability to
resist’ drinking, we are proposing to adapt procedures from our successful ‘ability to resist’ smoking models
that we have been developing and utilizing for the past 18 years. Our smoking models have demonstrated
predictive validity with regards to smoking cessation medications with large effects and have been utilized
widely by the research community and the pharmaceutical industry. We are planning to develop our ‘ability to
resist’ drinking models following the staged process that we have used to develop our smoking models. For
this 2-year application, we are proposing to develop two versions of the ‘ability to resist’ drinking model
designed to screen AUD medications which map onto clinically meaningful endpoints. Model 1 will map onto
key FDA endpoints for AUD medication approval: % abstinent, and % with no heavy drinking. Model 2 will map
onto non-abstinent outcomes (i.e., WHO Risk criteria). We also plan to evaluate potential mechanisms
underlying the ability to resist drinking and ad-libitum drinking behavior across the two models. Positive
findings from this proposal will 1) provide the necessary data to proceed with validating the models using
medications with known clinical efficacy for AUD and 2) ultimately provide an important resource to the
research community that will facilitate translational work in medication development for alcohol use disorder."
10947791,"Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a benign breast disease with the potential to develop into invasive breast
cancer (IBC). DCIS is detected in around 25% of breast risk screens, yet it is not possible to determine from
pathological evaluation which women will progress to IBC. This results in overtreatment by whole breast
radiation, partial mastectomy, partial mastectomy or mastectomy to eliminate risk of progression. Contemporary
literature reports that qualitatively, stroma collagen plays has a role in tumor sensing to limit progression and
that collagen fiber width, length and curvature are predictive of progression. The molecular composition of stroma
collagen represents a knowledge gap that could potentially predict progression and limit overtreatment, as well
as lead to new molecular insights on stroma signaling related to breast cancer risk. Our preliminary data shows
that peptides representing cell interactive collagen domains are regulated by DCIS lesion pathology that
represents risk and are predictive of progression. From this data, our overall hypothesis is that stromal proteomic
signatures derived from post-translational modification of collagen surrounding or within the microenvironment
differentiate DCIS lesion architectures representing risk and are predictive of progression. This exploratory
translational project will develop the concept that stroma proteomic signatures are predictive of outcome in breast
cancer risk. Aim 1 will work to differentiate intrapatient and interpatient heterogeneity of DCIS lesion pathology
from IBC in 90 lumpectomies (29% black women/71% white women) associated with DCIS by spatial stromal
and cellular proteomics coupled to multiplexed immunohistochemistry. Biosignatures of DCIS risk (large lesion,
high nuclear grade and comedo necrosis) will be evaluated compared to lower risk DCIS pathologies and IBC.
In Aim 2, we will evaluate clinically characterized and cell defined tissue microarrays from the Resource for
Archival Breast Tissue (RAHBT) consisting of tissue cores from primary DCIS diagnosis with median prospective
follow-up of 11.4 years representing 35% black women/68% white women. Biosignatures from spatial stromal
proteomics associated with nuclear grade and architectural g patterns of solid, cribriform, and comedo necrosis
will be evaluated relative to outcome. Machine learning algorithms will be used to assess significance of collagen
stromal regulation between pathologies, subtypes, and clinical characteristics including ancestry with an overall
goal of using stroma signatures from the DCIS lesion to predict progression. A long-term goal is to change the
clinical paradigm of patient management by overtreatment to using molecular markers of patient risk at the time
of clinical diagnosis that guide treatment of high-risk patients and limit overtreatment for those with a low risk of
progression."

The ultimate objective of this R03 proposal is to enable Dr. Ida Fonkoue to launch her independent research
career by 1) expanding her current K01 research objectives; 2) providing additional support in her transition to
a future NIH R01 grant; and 3) generating sufficient preliminary results to support that R01 application. The
candidate’s long-term goal is to build an NIH-funded research program in clinical and translational research in
women’s health, studying longitudinal derangements of vascular, neural and hormonal control, that contribute
to the high rates of hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women living with chronic stress
exposure such as those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder or panic
disorder. Over 7 million U.S. adults have PTSD, a disorder associated with a greater risk for hypertension and
CVD. While healthy premenopausal women are relatively protected from CVD compared to men, a diagnosis
of PTSD increases CVD risk in women by up to 3-fold. According to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, over 60 million women in the United States are living with some form of heart disease.
Understanding the mechanisms underlying long-term CVD risk in women with PTSD is of paramount
importance to develop intervention strategies aiming at protecting the future health of this vulnerable
population. Based on our preliminary data, the working hypothesis of this project is that: Over time, PTSD
significantly inhibits nitric oxide bioavailability, resulting in accelerated autonomic and vascular dysfunctions in
premenopausal women; and that these changes are exacerbated by low estradiol (E2) levels and sleep
disturbances. Aim 1 will measure longitudinal alterations in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity in
premenopausal women with PTSD and determine the extent to which these alterations are a function of low E2
levels and low sleep efficiency at two years follow-up. Aim 2 will measure longitudinal alterations in vascular
function in premenopausal women with PTSD and determine the extent to which these alterations are a
function of low E2 levels and low sleep efficiency at two years follow-up. We will use gold-standard in vivo
measures of sympathetic nerve activity (microneurography), endothelial (FMD) and vascular (applanation
tonometry) function to study young, traumatized women with and without PTSD. The university of Minnesota
University, where the project will be completed, boasts an intellectually rich research environment whose
resources will be used to carry out the proposed research, including an NIH-funded Clinical and Translational
Science Institute (CTSI). During this R03 award, the PI will devote 75% effort to this project and her current
K01 project. She recently achieved an important career-development milestone for her transition to full
independence by completing her Master of Science in Clinical Research. This research project, combined with
findings from her K01 and ongoing multidisciplinary mentorship, will help Dr. Fonkoue launch and sustain a
meritorious R01-funded independent research program."

Premature infants are vulnerable to long-term social, cognitive, and behavioral difficulties. However, not all
premature infants go on to have developmental delays. Moderate to late preterm infants (born after 32 weeks)
represent a missed clinical population as they do not automatically qualify for federally provided health
screening and intervention programs. Therefore, the investigation into the neural mechanisms underlying
heterogeneities in behavioral development is a promising approach to improve our ability to identify infants in
need of additional services and inform treatment responses. This is also an important public health mission
and a NICHD funding priority. The proposed K99 study will chart brain development using
electroencephalography (EEG) during well-baby visits (4, 9, and 12 months) at a primary care clinic and a
follow-up lab visit (24 months). Participants (N = 720 target recruitment) will be drawn from an ongoing R01 (PI
Nelson: 5R01NS120986) study that examines if EEG is feasible in the context of a primary care facility and
aids in the early identification of children who go on to receive an autism diagnosis. To this end, I will assess
the longitudinal trajectories of brain development in preterm and full term infants across the first two years of
life (aim 1). Next, I will determine the link between brain development and development delays (aim 2). Finally,
in the R00 phase, I will recruit and longitudinally follow a new sample of preterm (1 month chronological, 1
month corrected, 4 months chronological, and 4 months corrected) and full term infants (1 month chronological
and 4 months chronological). Using a multimethod neuroimaging approach (simultaneous functional Near-
Infrared Spectroscopy and EEG) I will explore when disruptions in cerebral blood flow responses and brain
activity first emerge and their associations with developmental delay. Overall, understanding
neurodevelopmental processes before and when delays first emerge provides a tractable approach to
improving psychological outcomes and well-being across the lifespan. The training and experience gained
during the award period will support my transition to becoming an independent investigator and will contribute
to my long-term research goals of investigating infant brain mechanisms underlying heterogeneities in social
and cognitive development."

Recently developed spatially resolved transcriptomics (ST) technologies measure transcriptome-wide gene
expression at a near-single-cell, single-cell, or sub-cellular resolution in intact tissue, preserving the spatial
organization of complex tissues. These technologies build upon widely-adopted single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNA-seq) technologies by adding spatial coordinates to the transcriptome-wide gene expression
measurements, thus enabling an understanding of how the spatial organization of cells in complex tissues
influences function, disease initiation, progression, and therapeutic response in human health and disease.
 However, these technologies also present new statistical and computational challenges, which need to
be addressed to accurately interpret this complex data. While initial studies applying these tools have reused
data analysis methods and data storage techniques designed for scRNA-seq, unfortunately these approaches
largely ignore spatial information. Furthermore, existing methodologies for ST data rely on external information
such as marker genes or reference cell types, potentially leading to systematic errors and biased results during
preprocessing, feature selection, classification of spatially resolved cell types, and differential discovery. There
do not yet exist robust and accurate preprocessing and unsupervised statistical methodologies to investigate
ST data in a data-driven manner. The overall goals of this K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award proposal
are to request support to address this fundamental gap in statistical methodology to develop spatially-aware (1)
methods for preprocessing, (2) unsupervised methods for spatially resolved clustering and differential
discovery between conditions, and (3) data infrastructure and benchmarking resources to standardize the
storage and access of ST data. These proposed methods will lead to an improved understanding of health and
disease mechanisms.
 This proposal will provide the training, mentoring, and professional development to accomplish my
research goals and transition to a tenure track faculty position at a research institution with independent
extramural funding. As the demand for ST technologies grows, in particular now that it has been highlighted as
the Nature Methods 2020 Method of the Year, these urgently needed statistical methods and open-source
software proposed in this project will enable ST technologies to transform precision medicine through novel
biological insights relating to spatial properties of cell populations and gene expression in healthy and diseased
tissues. At the completion of this award, I will become part of a new generation of researchers, proficient in
spatial statistics, machine learning, and spatial transcriptomics technologies, enabling me to work closely with
biomedical researchers spatially profiling the transcriptomes of complex tissues."
10953619,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Ovarian cancer (OVC) is the deadliest gynecologic cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related
death among US women. A critical limitation in fighting OVC is the inability to detect OVC early (stages I & II).
Detection at early stages improves five-year survival to ~95% compared to ~57% overall. The five-year survival
further drops to ~36% for black women. Currently, no reliable diagnostic markers are available that identify
OVC early and accurately. We utilize female chickens (hens) as a model to identify early and accurate
diagnostic biomarkers for OVC. Chickens (unlike mice) develop OVC spontaneously, just like humans.
Moreover, disease progression and disease staging parallels human OVC. Further, total number of ovulation
events (a risk factor, if high) and age of onset (menopause) are also similar across both species. The
overarching long-term goal of this research is to design and validate a diagnostic test similar to a mammogram
or a pap smear that can be routinely performed to identify OVC before it can be clinically identified. Based on
our preliminary data, this proposal seeks to identify and validate the potential role of lipid metabolites as
potential diagnostic biomarkers of OVC.
 In this proposal, we will utilize specific-pathogen free hens as an animal model. These hens develop
OVC spontaneously (similar to humans) with ~10-30% penetrance by 3.5 years of age. Based on our pilot
studies, we will perform non-biased metabolomic analysis on longitudinally harvested plasma samples using
the Sciex 6500+ quadropule ion trap (QTrap) in conjunction with the C18 liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) method for detecting ~550+ annotated
metabolites. Further, we will perform pre-clinical metabolomic validation on plasma samples obtained directly
from untreated patients, patients with benign disease presentation, and age-matched controls. Such
comprehensive metabolite profiling especially for lipid metabolites as early and accurate diagnostic biomarkers
in human ovarian cancer lays the groundwork for large-scale validation in patients, helping fulfill a critical need
in the ovarian cancer precision prevention landscape."
10949659,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Gene families include up to hundreds of highly similar sequences that may perform related but non-
redundant functions. Therefore, understanding how the correct gene is activated at the appropriate location
and time remains an important question. Odorant receptor (Or) genes present a particularly prominent example
of this problem. Previous research in mice (which have >1,000 Ors) and flies (which have 60 Ors) led to an
idea that large Or families employ stochastic gene choice, while small Or families follow deterministic
specification. The jumping ant Harpegnathos saltator lies in between these extremes, possessing 376 Or
genes, most of which are not interspersed throughout the genome, but located within tandem genomic arrays
that contain up to 58 genes each. This proposal will test a model where each olfactory sensory neuron (OSN)
in ants expresses a single locus, either a single gene or an array, using the same deterministic mechanism as
Drosophila melanogaster to choose between a limited number of loci. Single gene loci are expressed
deterministically, while loci that contain multiple genes have an added stochastic mechanism by which a single
Or promoter is chosen out of the array. To this end, I performed single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) on the
H. saltator antennae. Strikingly, although isolated genes were uniquely expressed in non-overlapping sets of
OSNs, genes within arrays were co-expressed. In all such cases, they followed a highly stereotypical pattern:
given genes A, B, C within an array, either C (the most 3’ gene) was expressed alone in some OSNs, or B and
C were co-expressed in another subset of OSNs, or all three genes were expressed concurrently in yet
another subset. In addition, the snRNA-seq data revealed extensive antisense transcription in these loci. The
antisense RNAs covered genes upstream of the first transcribed gene and appeared to originate from the
same promoter. Thus, the antisense RNAs are mutually exclusive with the sense RNAs, suggesting that the
antisenses may repress the transcription of genes upstream of the chosen promoter. In aim 1, I will investigate
the mechanisms of the co-transcription among clustered genes, determine whether co-transcribed genes are
co-translated and whether OSNs that express them target distinct glomeruli in the brain, identify sequence
features that enable transcription and provide stability to the antisense RNAs, and test the potential repressive
function of the antisense transcripts. Together, this will provide a comprehensive description of the
transcriptional mechanisms of the single gene choice in H. saltator Or arrays and uncover how this translates
into protein expression. In aim 2, I will determine the transcription factor code associated with each Or gene,
collect chromatin interaction and multiome (snRNA-seq paired with ATAC-seq) data to comprehensively
identify putative regulatory regions, determine whether one or both alleles are expressed in each cell, and test
the function of the candidate enhancers. Together, this will uncover the regulatory architecture of the Or loci,
potentially revealing a novel stochastic mechanism of promoter choice within arrays."

Despite decades of research into mechanisms of double-strand break (DSB) repair, factors shaping the
outcomes of defective repair remain poorly understood. DSB repair plays a central role in the maintenance of
genome integrity, and is relevant for a variety of congenital diseases, cancer, and infertility. DSBs are repaired
by a range of mechanisms that utilize varying lengths of homologous sequence to form repair intermediates.
The mutations that occur when DSBs are joined to incorrect regions of the genome are termed structural
variants (SVs). I hypothesize that factors guiding SV formation and genomic patterns of SVs can be
revealed by studying features of SVs such as imperfect sequence homology, span, and SV type (ie
deletion, translocation, etc). Using innovative computational methods and experimentation in yeast and human
cells, I will test the following hypotheses:
Aim 1: Homology-mediated DSB repair uses imperfect homology to repair DSBs. My previous results
suggest that imperfect homology, or microhomeology (MHe) likely plays a role in homologous recombination
(HR). I will use computational methods to determine if HR status is associated with MHe prevalence across
thousands of genomes. I will then create DSBs in yeast and human cell lines to determine if DSBs are
preferentially repaired to regions with more homeology. Finally, I will analyze new datasets to determine if MHe
can be used as a tool to predict tumor response to drugs that target HR or cause DSBs.
Aim 2: Germline alterations in DSB repair genes associate with germline genomic signatures of SVs.
Using previously-established computational methods, I will discover patterns, or signatures, of SVs in large
databases of germline genomes. By comparing SV signatures between individuals with vs. without
loss-of-function mutations in DSB repair genes, I will determine the effect of DSB repair defects on genomic
structure. Finally, given recent surprising findings indicating a role for SVs in neurodegenerative disorders, I will
assess the role of SV signatures in heart and lung diseases. This work will enable greater understanding of
DSB repair, an essential aspect of cellular biology that plays a role in many areas of human health.
I plan to lead a lab leveraging wet and dry methods to study DSB repair, genomic signatures of SVs, and their
role in human disease. In my lab I will mentor young scientists, particularly those from underrepresented
groups. My career development plan includes training in software development, genomics tools, and yeast
experimentation, as well as scientific communication, lab management, and scientific writing. My institutions
provide a rich environment replete with ample seminars, cutting-edge technologies, and expert collaborators."

 In this K24 application, I seek to enhance my capability as a leader in patient-oriented cardiovascular
research and mentorship at Washington University. The proposed research includes new advanced
implementation research using the NHLBI-funded Hypertension Treatment in Nigeria Program, which I co-lead
with Dr. Dike Ojji from University of Abuja and is among the largest hypertension control programs in Africa.
Specifically, I seek to understand not just if, but how, why, and in what context implementation of the World
Health Organization’s HEARTS technical package improves hypertension care at multiple levels—patient, site,
and system. To do so, my research explores multi-level mediation of team based care (the “T” in HEARTS) on
blood pressure at site and patient levels, as an exemplar. I also seek to define trajectories of retention, also
known as persistence, in longitudinal hypertension care. Based on these results, I will use mixed methods
including new patient oriented data collection through key informant interviews and discrete choice
experiments to understand reasons and preferences for retention trajectories and re-engagement in care. I will
be supported by outstanding dissemination and implementation science researchers at Washington University
to advance my own research skillset through these research aims.
 This proposal also includes the dual goal of improving my mentoring skills. Short-term goals focus on
expanding my mentoring of patient oriented clinician investigators for NIH K or similar awards and securing
additional R and D grants, as well as new P grants, to support both my research and that of my mentees.
Medium- and long-term goals aim to establish a best-in-class mentorship program in global cardiovascular
patient oriented research at Washington University in collaboration with the World Heart Federation and to
facilitate successful transitions for US and international mentees from K to R-level funding (n=6 currently). I will
participate in additional mentorship training, leadership programs, and research skill development activities
during the award period, including related to the responsible conduct of research and global health ethics
through the NIH-funded Compass program. I will use the Mentor Competency Assessment as a tool to monitor
my performance. I will use the NIH-sponsored Translational Science Benefits Model to disseminate my
research and will help my mentees incorporate this approach into their own methods. My exceptional
mentoring team comprises experts like Drs. Elvin Geng, Victor Dávila-Román, Margaret McNairy, and Dike Ojji,
who bring a wealth of relevant experience and skills in advanced dissemination and implementation research,
research training programs, global health, and women in global health. We will meet regularly to refine my
mentoring strategies and skills. This integrated approach ensures that I can provide top-tier mentoring while
generating new, high-impact patient oriented research."

HIV integrates into the host genome and enters a state of latency, enabling infected cells to
escape immune recognition and clearance. Eliminating the latent reservoir will require an
understanding of the early host mechanisms that regulate latency establishment and
mechanisms that reinforce latency during ART suppression. This can be achieved by
investigating three major questions: provirus integration preferences, the “where.” The host
mechanisms that regulate proviral integration, the “how.” The effect of integration on the host
transcriptional and epigenetics programs.
There is growing evidence of the host's early factors, including the levels of metabolites of host
and commensal bacteria origin, specific cytokines, or frequencies of activated innate and
adaptive immune cells in modulating key host immune mechanisms that could promote disease
progression and increase susceptibility to infection as a result of heightened levels of immune
homeostasis and effector function perturbation. However, our knowledge of the host early
mechanisms that regulate SIV integration and the impact of integration on the overall host
immune system is poorly understood.
In this proposal, I will leverage existing samples collected from SIV-infected ART-suppressed
rhesus macaques at baseline (pre-infection), before ART initiation, and during ART suppression
to generate an ATLAS of SIV integration sites. In these animals, we observed a significant
dynamic range of integrated SIV DNA before ART initiation, suggesting that host factors could
be responsible for the heterogeneity of the replication-competent SIV reservoir. To delineate the
impact of the host factors on the SIV integration, we will use single-cell assays that capture host
gene expression and chromatin accessibility, as well as plasma levels of cytokines and
metabolites of the host and commensal bacteria to characterize the mechanisms triggered early
in infection by host factors that regulate SIV integration and determine how SIV integration
impacts the host transcriptome and epigenome.
The outcome of this study could uncover intricate mechanisms by which the host's immune
system influences SIV integration and how integration, in turn, shapes the host gene expression
and immune functions. These insights can pave the way for innovative therapeutic strategies to
prevent viral integration or reverse host immune dysfunction, ultimately offering new possibilities
for HIV cure research."

 Obesity affects nearly half of the adult US population and is a risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events
such as stroke and cardiac arrest, and Type II diabetes. Obesity promotes inflammation of the visceral adipose
tissue (VAT), which in turn drives hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and contributes to cardiovascular
inflammation. Therefore, my long-term research goal is understanding the breakdown of tissue homeostatic
mechanisms in the VAT, which may help understand and lead to treatments that constrain the development of
obesity-associated inflammation.
 The overall objective of this proposal is to delineate adipose tissue topography using a multimodal
approach through spatial sequencing, thick section confocal microscopy and flow cytometry to identify novel
signaling or cell populations as therapeutic targets for treatment of obesity-associated inflammation. Profiling
stromal and immune cells in the eVAT, I’ve shown their close association and remodeling during high fat diet.
Based on these data, my central hypothesis is that obesity alters eVAT tissue topography, thus bringing
together signaling partners that drive inflammatory and pro-fibrotic reprogramming responsible for resident
lymphoid and body-wide metabolic dysfunction. I propose to study the spatial and temporal relationships among
immune and fibroblasts in obesifying eVAT in two aims. In Aim 1, I will topographically delineate fibroblast
contributions to obese tissue architecture and in Aim 2, I will assess immune cell contribution and identify unique
cellular signatures and interactions in mouse and human adipose using spatial sequencing.
 Having completed my MD PhD and residency in Clinical Pathology and fellowship in Cellular Therapy
and Transfusion Medicine, I am now pursuing research as an R38-funded StARR scholar. I am applying for the
K38 StARRTS Award to support my goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist. The exceptional
training program at UCSF, especially in the immunology and obesity fields, will support my effort. Key parts of
my training program leverage several aspects of this environment, including mentorship by Dr Ari Molofsky, an
expert in tissue immune and stromal niches; co-mentorship by Dr Richard Locksley, an expert in Type 2
immunity, and in vivo immunology; co-mentorship by Dr Suneil Koliwad, an expert in obesity-associated
inflammation and diabetes; guidance by a multidisciplinary advisory committee and collaborations with Drs Mike
Rosenblum and Dean Sheppard, experts in spatial sequencing and fibrosis, respectively; coursework in data
science, biostatistics, and research ethics; and professional development activities. Altogether, this career
development plan will establish a strong foundation for me to unravel mechanisms of obesity-associated
inflammation and for advancing towards an independent research program as a physician-scientist."

 Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in lifelong sensorimotor deficits, leading to chronic mobility impairments
and loss of functional independence. The restoration of walking remains a highly valued goal for persons with
chronic, incomplete SCI (iSCI) reducing sequalae due to immobility. Modest breathing modest bouts of low
oxygen (acute intermittent hypoxia; AIH), is shown to enhance motor recovery in both spinally injured rats and
persons with SCI by inducing adaptive reorganization in spared neural circuitry. Detailed mechanistic studies of
AIH-induced respiratory and non-respiratory motor plasticity in rats provide a fundamental basis to advance our
understanding and optimize the clinical benefits of AIH therapy. However, the underlying neural mechanisms
that contribute to improvements in functional recovery in humans with SCI remain unclear. Importantly, we do
not currently do not fully understand why AIH augments walking performance in humans with iSCI. In previous
studies, approximately 33% of study participants with chronic iSCI did not respond to the AIH intervention, not
achieving clinically meaningful improvements in motor performance. In order to optimize the clinical translation
of AIH as an adjuvant for walking rehabilitation, we will examine two critical knowledge gaps: (1) a lack of
understanding of the underlying mechanisms of AIH induced plasticity, (2) the identification of predictive
biomarkers to determine who optimally responds to AIH. To address the first knowledge gap, we will validate the
degree to which AIH engages the same cellular mechanisms in humans as observed in spinally injured rodents
by utilizing enzyme linked immunosorbent assays to quantify AIH induced synthesis of serotonin and brain
derived neurotrophic factor. To address the second knowledge gap, we will use magnetic resonance imaging to
measure descending tract connectivity as predictive biomarkers to identify responders in AIH. Responders will
be identified by quantifying gains in walking performance after the AIH intervention. To further support this
approach, we will utilize transcranial magnetic stimulation to clarify the functional relevance of AIH induced
changes in the excitability of descending tract connectivity. Together, these studies will not only advance the
detection of patients who will optimally respond but also identify patient specific factors that facilitate or inhibit
AIH induced functional recovery. The insights gained from this study will enhance our understanding of how to
harness AIH-induced plasticity to promote meaningful recovery and will profoundly impact the lives of persons
with chronic spinal injuries."

Airway basal epithelial cells (BCs) play critical roles in lung homeostasis particularly in repair from injury
reflecting their ability to differentiate into and replenish a range of mature epithelial cell types. Increasing
knowledge of cell signaling and other transcriptional pathways regulating these behaviors has emerged over
recent years. However, less information is available about the effects of the physical environment, particularly
the lung extracellular matrix (ECM) on BC behaviors. The ECM is increasingly recognized as affecting cell
growth, differentiation, and other actions, reflecting ECM properties including protein content as well as
stiffness all of which can affect cell behaviors. Notably both BCs and ECM composition and structure can be
altered in diseases, for example COPD. However, the mechanistic links between altered ECM and
dysregulated BC self-renewal and differentiation is poorly understood. Better understanding will provide new
insights into normal lung epithelial homeostasis and disruption in disease and provide potential new
therapeutics.
To address this, we have developed novel tools and exciting preliminary data. Co-PI Dr. Ren has developed
novel “inside-out” spheroid BC cultures in which the apical cell surfaces are exterior (apical-out airway
organoids, AOAO), a reverse polarity compared to traditional spheroid cultures of airway epithelial cells, and
one that better reflects how the native airway interfaces with the exterior environment. In parallel, co-PI Dr.
Weiss has developed a novel series of hydrogels derived from ECM of decellularized human lungs (dECM)
including those produced from airway, vascular, and alveolar-enriched compartments of both normal and
diseased (COPD, IPF) human lungs. These techniques, individually and in combination, are powerful new tools
that have provided novel and exciting preliminary data utilizing both normal and COPD lung-derived hydrogel
to influence lung epithelial cell growth and differentiation.
The goal of the current proposal is to utilize these tools to systematically assess the effects of normal and
diseased COPD ECM on relevant actions of BCs obtained from both normal and COPD lungs. Endpoint
assessments will be BC self-renewal and differentiation into mature airway epithelial cells. Importantly, we
have built an outstanding collaborative team including Dr. Amy Ryan (University of Iowa) with which to achieve
these goals. These studies will provide novel and important new information concerning ECM regulation of BC
homeostasis that will enhance knowledge of lung injury and repair and provide potential new therapeutic
avenues for use of BCs in cell-based and other therapies."

Up to 3 billion people will reside outside of the human climate niche due to climate change by the end of the
century and the wholesale abandonment of communities are now a reality. As some communities in the US
become increasingly environmentally precarious and settlements become abandoned, migration away from
these areas could increase exposure to displacement-related stressful life events (DR-SLEs) and their impact
on health. Such DR-SLEs are associated with short-term reduced health outcomes but little is known about
how these short-term reduced health outcomes could translate into long-term reduced health outcomes. No
database of US abandoned settlements currently exists, hindering our ability to study the long-term health
impacts of DR-SLEs. This project will build a comprehensive database of all enumerated places since 1890
and verify any settlements abandoned during since. We will then leverage this database by linking verified,
abandoned places between Census 1940 and 1950 to individuals in CenSoc, an NIA-funded database which
matches deceased persons in the Social Security Administration’s Death File to their 1940 Census record, to
estimate the causal effect of settlement abandonment on longevity using a synthetic control design. Findings
from this project will directly inform ongoing federal, state, and local policies of managed retreat and illustrate
the mortality penalty settlement abandonment could place on the millions of anticipated US-based climate
migrants this century."

laminar shear stress are actively anti-inflammatory and promote disease resistance whereas
disturbed fluid shear stress amplifies inflammatory and metabolic risk factors to promote
disease. Preliminary and published data implicate endothelial cell metabolism as critical in the
differential effects of laminar vs disturbed flow, including a mitochondrial pathway activated
through Piezo1 mechanosensitive channels, yet these effects, indeed, the entire area, is poorly
understood. Our preliminary data also implicate cell cycle as a critical part of these regulatory
effects, with a late G1 arrested state in which the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 is active as a
key inhibitor of atherogenic pathways. We therefore propose: 1) A thorough unbiased analysis
of effects of laminar vs disturbed shear stress on endothelial metabolism, with in vivo analysis of
Piezo1 loss and gain of function mutants, and extensive analysis to link metabolic effects to
disease pathways; 2) In vitro mechanistic and in vivo pre-clinical analysis of the role of Cdk2 in
endothelial inflammatory activation and disease, including links to metabolic pathways."

Lung recipients suffer from shorter life spans and higher rejection rates when compared to other solid organ 
recipients. To better advance a program project focused on the mechanisms of lung transplant rejection an 
administrative core is proposed with three specific aims: (1) to organize and facilitate communication between 
three projects and the microsurgical core (2) to maximize the use of fiscal resources and (3) to assemble a 
scientific advisory committee. This administrative core will consist of a core leader, an administrative lead and a
biostatistician, who will provide statistical support for each of the projects. The overall goal of the administrative 
core is to leverage the intellectual and financial resources of the individual projects to maximize overall scientific 
productivity."
10869910,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Pulmonary transplantation remains the only available treatment for numerous patients, who suffer 
from end-stage lung disease. However, outcomes after lung transplantation continue to be 
substantially worse than those after transplantation of other organs. Current immunosuppressive 
strategies for lung transplant patients are based on protocols that have been successfully used 
for recipients of other organs. However, such approaches do not account for fundamental 
differences between immune responses to lung grafts and other commonly transplanted solid 
organs. Utilizing new mouse models of lung transplantation we have uncovered that tolerance to 
pulmonary grafts is regulated locally through interactions of immune cells within lymphoid 
aggregates that are newly formed in the graft. We have reported that disruption of 
immunoregulatory circuits in tolerant grafts results in the local activation of graft-infiltrating 
lymphocytes, which triggers rejection. This application proposes to study mechanisms how 
tolerance is maintained at the level of the graft microenvironment after pulmonary transplantation 
and will allow for the development of new therapies for lung transplant recipients."

Clostridioides difficile, a Gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobic bacterium, is the leading cause of nosocomial
and antibiotic-associated intestinal infections in the United States. Over the past two decades, there has been a
significant rise in the incidence, severity, and economic burden of C. difficile infection (CDI). This increase can
be attributed to the limited efficacy of antibiotics, a growing recurrence rate of CDI, and the emergence of highly
virulent strains. These trends underscore the pressing need for alternative strategies in the treatment of CDI. To
colonize the gastrointestinal tract, C. difficile must compete with both the host and the gut microbiota for essential
nutrient iron. However, it is unclear how C. difficile adapts to nutrient iron stress in the gut during CDI. Thus, I set
out to interrogate the iron homeostasis systems in C. difficile and examine their physiological function. My
postdoctoral work has demonstrated that C. difficile undergoes an intracellular iron biomineralization process
and produces membrane-bound ferrosome organelles containing iron phosphate biominerals. The ferrosome
organelles serve as an iron storage mechanism, protecting cells against iron intoxication upon transient iron
overload. The ferrosome system is activated in the inflamed gut to combat host-mediated iron sequestration and
is important for bacterial colonization and persistence during CDI. A manuscript describing this work was recently
accepted for publication in Nature. However, the molecular basis of ferrosome biogenesis is largely unknown
and the implications of ferrosome formation within the context of CDI remain unclear. This project aims to
elucidate the underlying mechanisms of ferrosome formation and define its influence on host-microbe
interactions. In this application, we hypothesize that (i) the ferrosome membrane derives from the cytoplasmic
membrane but exhibits distinct lipid composition, (ii) iron is transported to the FezB transporter through the iron
importer FeoA3B3, aided by an iron chaperone, (iii) many other factors play roles in various stages of ferrosome
formation including iron oxidation, nucleation, and biomineralization, (iv) the ferrosome system facilitates C.
difficile adaptation to nutrient iron stress mediated by both the host and gut commensals, and (v) nutrient iron
exhibits profound effects on CDI outcomes, gut microbiome resilience, and host immune responses. The
experiments described in this proposal will test these hypotheses, elucidate the underlying mechanisms of
ferrosome biogenesis, determine the function of ferrosome organelles within the gut community, and define the
impact of nutrient iron on host-microbe interactions. Furthermore, the findings of this proposal will uncover novel
factors critical for C. difficile infection and create a framework for developing effective antimicrobial therapeutics
to combat this important infection."
10947270,"Project Summary. Polyketide natural products have played, and will continue to play, critical roles in cancer
chemotherapy. Though they are potent and often tumor-selective agents, access to gram scale supplies of these
agents complicates their clinical translation. Current solutions, including chemical synthesis and strain
optimization, have provided modest success, but our lack in understanding the machines responsible for their
production ultimately limits the ability to attain effective levels of production. Type I polyketide synthases (PKSs)
are large multifunctional enzymes that are organized into modules of discrete enzymatic proteins, minimally
containing a β-ketoacyl synthase, an acyltransferase, and an acyl carrier protein (ACP). While an ideal size for
cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), only a few Type I PKS structures currently exist, and of these many lack
resolution of their ACP domain. Like many large proteins, they exist naturally in a highly dynamic state, wherein
their activity operates through discrete, mechanical processes. In most Type I PKSs, biosynthesis arises through
assembly of ketide units, which are shuttled between the enzymatic domains by means of the ACP. Here, the
complex movement between domains in each module results in synchronic capture of multiple states of the
same protein, therein complicating structural evaluation. In this program, our team explores the pathways to
enable the selective evaluation of state trapped Type I PKSs. Through two specific aims, we offer a unique
solution towards isolating PKS megasynthases from host cells or producing them through recombinant
technologies for cryo-EM studies. Overall, two key fundamental discoveries will arise from this program: an
approach to isolating PKS enzymes for cryo-EM studies by directly challenging the current methods; and a
primary understanding of the selectivity and mechanics involved in PKS catalysis. We anticipate that this
program will offer not only a basis for structural resolution of large PKS enzymes, but also offer insight into
modular and intermodular dynamics within these complex multimodular synthases."

Clostridioides difficile (Cd) infection (CDI) is a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections in the U.S.,
affecting ~500,000 people and costing ~$5.4B annually. Despite substantial advances in investigating Cd
pathogenesis and transmission over the past 20 years, CDI remains a significant public health burden.
Conventional antimicrobial therapy often fails to clear Cd, can inflict extensive collateral damage to the
commensal gut microbiome (GM), and frequently leads to recurrent CDI, for which treatment options are limited.
A major impediment in mitigating Cd-associated disease is current unclear understanding of the biological basis
for the broad spectrum of disease severity, from asymptomatic Cd colonization to recurrent fatal CDI. In this
context, elucidating mechanisms of Cd colonization and disease necessitates explicit consideration of
confounding GM interactions that increase a patient's CDI risk. Accordingly, we propose a quantitative
investigation of pathogen-GM-host dynamics of clinically prominent Cd lineages and their contribution to CDI,
leveraging a unique cohort of >30,000 Cd-associated patient stools with accompanying well-curated clinical
metadata. We hypothesize that high-resolution genomic analyses of Cd strains and pathogen-GM interactions
will enable sensitive identification of novel genomic elements in virulent lineages associated with variable CDI
outcomes. The rationale for this proposal stems from i) the recognition that most Cd research relies on studying
hypervirulent, previously epidemic lineages that are no longer prevalent in the clinic, ii) the need for stable,
reproducible GM-humanized animal models of CDI to investigate pathogen and human GM variables, and iii)
the observation that taxonomic and functional features of the GM, including bacteriophages, drive Cd's
adaptation as a pathobiont. Our central motivation is to expand the representation of prominent Cd lineages and
leverage our improved understanding of pathogen-GM dynamics, and our innovative technologies, to enable the
design of novel diagnostic, therapeutic, and management avenues to improve patient outcomes. This will be
achieved via three aims: 1) investigate pangenome determinants of CDI risk in clinically representative Cd
strains, 2) model and predict how different patient GM taxonomic and functional architectures, integrated with
clinical metadata, relate to CDI outcomes, and 3) characterize and predict Cd strain-specific dynamics by
employing innovative, defined GM-humanized gnotobiotic mouse models of Cd colonization and CDI. Our
analyses are significant as they pursue new avenues of precisely investigating pathobiont-commensal variables
that influence CDI, a model bacterial-microbiome infectious disease with extensive morbidity and mortality. This
proposal is innovative in improving understanding and prediction of Cd disease spectrum via novel
complementary technologies including GM-humanized gnotobiotic mouse models to identify pathogen and GM
drivers of clinical outcomes. The proposed work is impactful in its goal to address basic, translational, and
clinically relevant questions in GM-mediated infectious diseases, to enable a new era of precision therapies."

Title: WASp signaling in T-cell lymphomas
Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) are aggressive disorders, with less than 50% overall survival after 2-3
years of diagnosis. These dismal outcomes are in no small part secondary to the limited number of available
biomarkers of disease progression and the limited knowledge of T-cell lymphoma biology. Emergent evidence
indicates that the actin cytoskeleton plays a pivotal role during T-cell lymphomas' development and growth;
however, actin-related proteins' role as actionable targets in T-cell lymphomas still needs to be defined. Our
preliminary findings demonstrate that the actin regulatory protein Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) is
associated with decreased event-free survival and promotes T-cell lymphoma growth and survival. In this
proposal, we will leverage a genetically engineered murine (GEM) model that develops spontaneous peripheral
T-cell lymphomas (SNF5FL/CD4cre), and we will capitalize on an international consortium of more than 100 T-cell
lymphoma cases collected with accompanying annotated clinical outcomes, to test the role of WASp during the
assembly of actin-dependent signaling complexes upstream of oncogenic transcriptional signaling, and define
the role of the tumor microenvironment driving WASp-dependent oncogenic signaling."

Monoaminergic signaling controls many aspects of human physiology, including autonomic responses,
movement, and emotion. The vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) is the primary transporter
responsible for loading monoaminergic neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles (SVs) in the central nervous
system. Due to this role, dysregulation of VMAT2 can result in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including
Parkinson’s disease, depression, and drug addiction. Clinically, VMAT2 is targeted by inhibitors tetrabenazine
(TBZ) and reserpine (RES) for the treatment of Huntington’s disease and hypertension respectively.
Amphetamine is an addictive drug that is known to act on VMAT2 to cause vesicle deacidification and eventual
release of neurotransmitters from SVs and into the cytosol. These neurotransmitters are then effluxed into the
synapse from the pre-synaptic neuron where they can bind to receptors and elicit downstream effects. Despite
VMAT2’s role in these processes, little is known mechanistically about how VMAT2 functions to load
neurotransmitters into vesicles, and how amphetamine causes release of neurotransmitters from those
vesicles through its interaction with VMAT2. This represents a critical knowledge gap, and understanding these
processes will lead to improved means of combating diseases of VMAT2 dysregulation and the deadly effects
of amphetamine abuse. To tackle these questions, we will perform detailed structure-function analysis of
VMAT2 to reveal structural changes undergone by the transporter throughout the transport cycle, identify the
mechanism of substrate recognition, and how amphetamine acts on VMAT2 to cause neurotransmitter release.
To this end, we will pursue two specific aims: 1) Determine the basis of reserpine inhibition; and 2) understand
the molecular mechanisms of VMAT2 substrate transport and amphetamine action. Our anticipated results will
deepen our understanding of SV loading, and illuminate the mechanism of amphetamine action. They will
further provide foundational knowledge about how membrane transporters recognize and transport substrates
that will be applicable to related major facilitator family proteins. These studies will guide the development of
novel treatments with fewer side effects and greater specificity, and provide new avenues for the treatment of
drug abuse."
10947526,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Since 2019, adolescent overdoses have increased by 133% despite otherwise stable rates of substance use in the 14-25 age
group. Overdoses involving fentanyl (a highly potent synthetic opioid) tripled among adolescents and young adults from
2019 to 2021. There is also emerging evidence that fentanyl is being added to non-opioid drugs, such as stimulants (e.g.,
Adderall, Ritalin, cocaine) and counterfeit pills; this shift in fentanyl distribution may impact a much broader range of
adolescents and young adults, beyond those who knowingly use opioids. For numerous reasons—including that more than
half of all adolescents and young adults enroll in U.S. postsecondary education—colleges and universities represent an
important setting to understand and prevent opioid misuse and overdose nationwide. From a public health perspective, there
are two key gaps in evidence, which, if filled, would provide urgently needed information to inform opioid overdose
prevention during the developmentally and epidemiologically vulnerable college years. The first gap is the lack of large-
scale data on opioid overdose preparedness in college student populations, which could be used to design interventions for
subgroups of students who could most benefit. The second gap is that little is known about the perceptions of institutional
leaders regarding opioid overdose prevention at U.S. colleges and universities. Understanding the decision-making that
surrounds implementation of these programs, as well as the existing barriers for institutions that do not have such programs
and policies, is necessary to guide future intervention efforts in higher education. Utilizing three levels of data (population-
level student survey data, institutional-level policy data, institutional leader in-depth interview data), the immediate
objective of this project is to understand the current state of student opioid knowledge and opioid overdose prevention in
higher education. The long-term goal of this research is to generate evidence to inform the design and implementation of
opioid overdose and harm reduction programs and policies for the more than 16 million college students in the U.S.
The specific aims of this R36 proposal are to: (1) estimate, using national survey data from the Healthy Minds Study
(HMS), college students’ knowledge of (i) opioid risk, (ii) naloxone administration, and (iii) their willingness to intervene
during an opioid overdose (Aim 1 N=9,107 students at 18 institutions); and (2) explore, using in-depth interviews,
perceptions of and decision-making by institutional leaders regarding student opioid misuse and prevention efforts (Aim 2
N=24 at a diverse set of institutions with varying substance use policy environments). Survey data will be linked to a
college policy database to investigate associations between student-reported knowledge and opioid overdose and harm
reduction policies at included HMS institutions. In Aim 2, relevant leaders (e.g., directors of student health services,
director of student wellness) from HMS institutions will be invited to participate in semi-structured, in-depth interviews
exploring their perceptions of student opioid misuse and harm reduction programs. The proposed research is innovative as
it is the first known study to use large-scale, multi-campus data from college students to examine their knowledge of
opioid overdose risk, naloxone, and willingness to intervene during an overdose. It is significant as our findings will have
a broader impact on filling gaps relating to opioid overdose prevention in higher education settings."

Auditory processing abnormalities are common and prominent features of neurodevelopmental disorders such
as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A central challenge of autism research is to identify common mechanisms
that underlie sensory processing abnormalities including auditory dysfunction. One prevalent hypothesis is that
the behavioral phenotypes in ASD arise from altered functional connectivity in the brain. Neuroimaging studies
and the transcriptional profile in human ASD indicate that altered myelination and white matter integrity could be
a common pathophysiology that impairs functional connectivity. Auditory processing requires precise and timely
control of axonal conduction and synaptic activity, making the auditory system vulnerable to the developmental
disruptions of ASD. Our long-term goal is to investigate the mechanisms whereby altered myelination and brain
connectivity impair auditory processing in neurodevelopmental disorders. Our previous studies have shown that
alterations in myelination disrupt axonal conduction, alter synaptic function, and impede circuit-level functions in
the auditory brainstem. Our recent studies pioneered a new concept in how excitability in oligodendrocytes (OL),
the myelinating glial cell, contributes to communication between neurons and OLs. We characterized a
subpopulation of excitable OLs that express the voltage-gated Na+ channel 1.2 (Nav1.2), display Nav1.2-
mediated spiking, and respond to neuronal activity. Notably, Scn2a, which encodes the alpha subunit of Nav1.2
channel, has a robust association with ASD. These studies indicate that oligodendroglial Scn2a is important for
electrical excitability in OLs, for communication between OL and neurons, and for establishing functional
connectivity in the auditory brainstem. The primary objective of the proposed study is to link the loss of
oligodendroglial Scn2a to alterations in myelination and neural connectivity in the auditory system to better
understand how auditory processing is altered in Scn2a-mediated disorders and ASD. We have generated a
novel Scn2a conditional knockout mouse (cKO) to specifically delete Scn2a in OLs. These mice exhibit deficits
in myelination, altered neurotransmission, and remarkable changes in auditory function. We hypothesize that
Scn2a expression in developing OLs is required for coordinating neuron-OL interactions that are essential for
myelination and proper development of neural circuits in the auditory nervous system. Using multiple-approaches
including in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology, we will determine the role of Scn2a in OL development and
myelination (Aim 1), examine how the loss of Scn2a-expressing OL alters synaptic transmission and plasticity
at a local synapse in the auditory brainstem (Aim 2), and link the loss of oligodendroglial Scn2a to alterations
neural connectivity and auditory processing abnormalities (Aim 3). In summary, this study will reveal how loss
of Nav1.2-mediated OL excitability alters myelination, functional connectivity, and auditory processing in the
auditory brainstem. Understand how altered myelination results in neural circuitry dysfunction that functionally
related to auditory processing abnormalities in a novel model will provide better therapeutic strategies for ASD."

Limited sensitivity to chemotherapy and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment drives breast cancer 
mortality in HER2 negative breast cancer. We have identified the IRE1/XBP1 branch of the Unfolded Protein 
Response (UPR) or endoplasmic reticulum (EnR) stress response as a previously unexplored therapeutic 
vulnerability in MYC-driven breast cancer that enhances chemotherapy sensitivity and reverses the 
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. IRE1 is amplified in ~10% of human breast cancer, and 
frequently co-amplified with the MYC oncogene. Activation of MYC is synthetic lethal with IRE1/XBP1 pathway 
inhibition. We found that inhibition of the IRE1/XBP1 pathway with a highly selective first-in-class IRE1 RNase
inhibitor ORIN1001 suppresses MYC-high-expressing (MYChigh), but not MYC-low-expressing (MYClow), tumor 
growth in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. ORIN1001 substantially enhances the docetaxel efficacy, 
resulting in rapid tumor regression and complete eradication of the MYChigh PDX tumors. Furthermore, the 
ORIN1001 plus docetaxel therapy triggers massive cytotoxic T-cell infiltration, depletion of immunosuppressive 
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and substantial upregulation of PD-L1 in the tumor 
microenvironment. Non-human primate toxicology testing showed that ORIN1001 has excellent safety profile 
and is well-tolerated. These preclinical data prompt us to hypothesize that inhibition of the IRE1/XBP1 pathway 
with the IRE1 inhibitor ORIN1001 compromises MYChigh breast cancers by inhibiting obligatory UPR stress 
adaptation required for cellular viability. This therapeutic effect of ORIN1001 is associated with a marked 
increase in taxane sensitivity. In addition, MDSCs are also selectively depleted by ORIN1001 in the presence 
of a taxane, thus reversing immunosuppression and potentially sensitizing MYChigh breast cancers to immune 
checkpoint intervention. A pre-clinical phase study in breast cancer models will be conducted in parallel with a
Phase 1 clinical trial. In Aim 1, we will establish diagnostic tests to determine eligibility for a clinical trial of 
ORIN1001 plus taxane combination therapy. Aim 2 will exploit the immunomodulatory effects of ORIN1001 
plus docetaxel therapy in breast cancer by testing the addition of anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy. In Aim 3, we will 
conduct a phase I dose escalation study of ORIN1001 alone, then in combination with paclitaxel, followed by 
expansion cohorts in 4 subsets of breast cancer. The overarching objective of this proposal is to design and 
open a Phase 2 clinical trial in MYC-positive metastatic breast cancer with eligibility and endpoints to be 
defined by the execution of the research aims."

Infertility impacts one in five couples globally. For many of these couples, the sperm and egg look
morphologically normal. This complicates determining treatments for infertility. Despite the societal burden of
infertility and the need for reproductive control through new contraceptive targets, the genes and molecules
required for fertilization particularly the genes on the egg side are still largely unknown. The persistent lack of
molecular mechanisms surrounding fertilization often hinders determining therapeutic interventions. There are
many reasons that it been difficult to find egg function genes. This spans from redundant gene function,
pleiotropy, lack of validation from biochemical approaches, and challenges in maintaining sterile mutants.
These challenges highlight the importance genetic approaches to understand the genes required for these
mechanisms. I will use the Caenorhabditis elegans model system to conduct this research as it has a high
percentage of genetic homology with mammals, a quick generation time, and robust genetic tools. To facilitate
the identification of egg function genes, I designed and validated a forward genetic screen in Caenorhabditis
elegans using newly available balancer chromosomes to isolate uncharacterized genes involved in egg binding
and fusion as well as factors required for egg activation/the oocyte to embryo transition. This proposal will
determine the molecular mechanism of several of these newly discovered genes. I propose the following
research aims: 1) Investigate the molecular function of PGM-3 in the oocyte 2) Explore the effects of a newly
identified sperm supplied factor required for egg activation 3) Characterize other new gamete function mutants
that were previously identified. This mentored postdoctoral period of funding will provide me with the time and
resources to learn super resolution microscopy and proximity labeling as well as the skills to navigate a career
as an independent researcher. These skills are essential for my future career development goals which include
obtaining a faculty position and leading my own research program. To facilitation completion of these goals, I
have established a scientific advisory committee and a career development mentoring committee. Each are
comprised of experts in my field to assist me in my training. I also propose taking a microscopy course to
ensure that I have formal training in this complex subject. The K99 portion of this award will take place at
Rutgers University which has both a robust research and career development infrastructure for postdoctoral
training. The K99/R00 funding mechanism will allow me to learn and apply novel technology to accelerate
discovery of the molecules required for fertilization."

Wolbachia endosymbionts hold strong potential for the control of vector-borne infections. Indeed, these bacteria
are currently used to control dengue virus transmission by Aedes aegypti, where they combine the ability to
spread through populations via Cytoplasmic Incompatibility (CI) with efficient blocking of arboviral infections. For
decades, however, scientists have been puzzled by the apparent lack of both natural and artificial Wolbachia
infections in Anopheles, the vectors of human malaria, with only a handful of examples reported. Wolbachia are
genetically intractable, making functional study of both their reproductive manipulations and this host tropism
difficult. However, my previous work suggests that a Wolbachia-derived CI-inducing factor, CifB, causes severe
abnormalities in females (rescued by a different gene, cifA), that may in part prevent Wolbachia from establishing
natural infections in Anopheles mosquitoes. I will elucidate the mechanisms regulating Wolbachia infections in
Anopheles, while gaining general mechanistic insight into CI in insects. Using a combination of genetics, cell
biology, molecular, genomic and bioinformatics approaches to address key questions related to Wolbachia
toxicity and rescue across different insects, these studies will push the field of insect-endosymbiont interactions
into new areas of inquiry and will also generate tools for the generation of Wolbachia-based strategies for the
control of malaria-transmitting Anopheles populations.
I will conduct the K99 phase of this award as a post-doctoral researcher in Dr. Flaminia Catteruccia’s group at
the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The laboratory is exceptionally well-equipped to establish
transgenic insects and is one of the only vector biology labs with a robotic micro-injector and a COPAS Biosorter
in addition to a world-class Plasmodium infection facility. Dr. Catteruccia is supported by the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute, which allows flexibility of research funds which can be drawn upon for this project, and
facilitates access to state-of-the-art equipment, facilitating expansive research in vector biology. In addition to
Dr. Catteruccia’s expertise in mosquito reproduction, mosquito transgenesis, and host-parasite interactions, I will
be supported by Dr. Zhiyong Xi, an expert at the forefront of Wolbachia-based vector control implementation in
Aedes mosquitoes, and in establishing Wolbachia infections in Anopheles. Further, I will collaborate with Dr.
John Beckmann, a molecular biologist and biochemist with expertise working with Wolbachia’s CI-inducing
factors, and Dr. Lauren Childs, a mathematical modeling specialist. Additional mentors will include local
researchers Dr. Daniel Neafsey, who has vast experience with functional genomics in Wolbachia, Anopheles,
and Plasmodium, and Dr. Paul Garrity whose group excels at genetic engineering of various Dipterans. This
combination of expertise will train me to have a unique perspective and skillset to apply to research questions
related to tripartite interactions between Wolbachia, Anopheles and Plasmodium, with which I will be well-
positioned to establish an independent laboratory with a distinct set of research capabilities and questions."

Asthma inequitably impacts under-resourced, Black, and Hispanic youth who experience higher asthma
morbidity. These disparities are partially explained by social adversity experienced at multiple levels (child,
family, community). Yet, these critical associations between social adversity and pediatric asthma are not fully
incorporated into strategies to address morbidity among children which may exacerbate existing inequities,
meaning such at-risk children experience decreased quality of life, higher school absenteeism, and decreased
educational and employment achievement in late childhood and adulthood. In this proposal, Dr. Tyris’ objective
is to advance the existing knowledge on social adversity and asthma morbidity with diverse methodologies that
seek to better integrate social care (activities mitigating health-related adverse social factors) into medical care
for children. She will pursue this overall objective through the following specific aims: Aim 1: Predict risk of
hospitalization among DC children with asthma using multi-level social adversity indicators. A population-based
machine learning model using the DC Pediatric Asthma Registry (n= >19,000) and social adversity, clinical,
and demographic data will be developed to predict risk of asthma-related hospitalization and to identify which
variables are most predictive of children at highest risk for hospitalization. Aim 2: Characterize caregiver
perspectives of mechanisms to address modifiable family-level variables that impact child asthma morbidity. A
community advisory board will be established to conduct longitudinal focus groups and engage with caregivers
of children frequently hospitalized for asthma to refine family-level approaches to address social adversity and
enhance recruitment and retention issues for a pilot RCT. Aim 3: Determine feasibility and acceptability of an
integrated social care intervention of individualized assistance and adjustment strategies among caregivers of
children with asthma. Dr. Tyris will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to determine if using addressing
social adversity in routine asthma care with assistance (helping resolve social adversity) and adjustment
(modifying health care to overcome social barriers) will be acceptable to caregivers and feasible to implement.
The outlined career development plan, including the proposed aims, will enable Dr. Tyris to gain advanced
training and knowledge in four key areas: machine learning methods for risk prediction, stakeholder-engaged
intervention design, clinical trial design and execution, and integrated social and medical care interventions.
She will leverage the expertise of Dr. Tyris’ mentors (Drs. Teach and Parikh) and advisors (Drs. Trujillo Rivera,
Hinds, and Gottlieb) and the robust, supportive research environment at Children’s National Hospital and
George Washington University. Successful completion of this career development and research proposal will
facilitate Dr. Tyris’ overarching career goal to become an independent and federally funded investigator who
creates, implements, evaluates, and effectively translates stakeholder-engaged solutions designed to mitigate
social adversity, promote health equity, and improve care and outcomes for children with asthma."

The lymphatic system, integral to fluid balance, fat absorption, and immunity, actively propels lymph fluid via
specialized lymphatic muscle cells (LMCs) and coordinated contractile behavior. Lymphatic vessels play a crucial
role in maintaining fluid balance. The entire plasma volume extravasates from the blood roughly every 9 hours
and is reclaimed by the lymphatic system and returned to the central circulation. Disruption to lymphatic function,
from factors like inflammation or medications, can lead to edema. In critical illness, edema increases morbidity
and mortality. Despite extensive use of anesthetics like isoflurane, propofol, ketamine, and dexmedetomidine,
their impact on lymphatic function remains unknown. In this innovative proposal, the goal is to study the impact
of these anesthetics on lymphatic function using advanced lymphatic functional imaging techniques in a novel
murine model of critical care. The translational model includes tracheostomy, controlled mechanical ventilation,
an intra-arterial line, a central venous catheter for infusion of drugs, and vital sign monitoring. This is combined
with three imaging modalities: intravital fluorescence lymphangiography to quantitatively measure lymphatic
contractions, intravital near infrared fluorescence lymphangiography to measure lymphatic network behavior,
and a novel bioluminescent assay to quantify the rate of clearance of interstitial fluid. In Aim 1, experiments will
probe the effects of various anesthetics on lymphatic contractility in a critical care mouse model. Both systemic
influences and direct vascular effects of anesthetics on lymphatic function and fluid clearance will be measured.
Electrophysiology will complement in vivo lymphatic imaging to directly observe changes in LMC excitability
mediated by anesthetics. In Aim 2, the study will explore the relationship between anesthetics and lymphatic
adrenergic receptor activation, examining whether anesthetics influence lymphatic contractility via the
sympathetic nervous system, the potential functional rescue effects of norepinephrine, and the distribution of
adrenergic receptors in human lymphatic tissue. The proposed research aspires to profoundly shape future
clinical practice by elucidating the impact of anesthetics on lymphatic pumping and tissue edema. This will allow
for future tailored anesthetic selection in the operating room and intensive care unit based on the patient’s level
of edema. The Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award candidate, an MD, PhD with a

Systemic inequities, defined as the ‘structures, policies, practices, and norms that assign value and determine opportunity based on the way people look or their backgrounds,’ permeate all aspects of society and are ever present in academia. These inequities are perpetuated through normative, and often unconscious, biases and behaviors. In recent years, academic institutions have devised new policies and initiatives to promote inclusive excellence, and in doing so have put a greater burden on underrepresented (UR) faculty to lead these efforts. Yet, many UR faculty are continuing to disproportionately leave the academy, indicating that academic institutions have not succeeded in their goal of dismantling systemic inequities and making academia more inclusive. As charged by the expansive array of governing bodies and civic leaders in their declarations that these systemic inequities have led to a public health crisis, people, communities, and institutions must develop and embrace comprehensive, strategic, and systems-thinking approaches to realize a more equitable and inclusive society. We developed an intervention that uses structured cognitive behavioral training (SCBT), an organized cognitive-based process that employs systematic, highly-structured practices, to break down socialized, unconscious biases and behaviors, replacing them with behaviors that are more aligned with personal values. To build the knowledge base of evidence-based interventions that address systemic inequities, we are testing our intervention using a cluster randomized trial across 26 institutions. We will follow participants for two years to study the impact of the intervention. We will also study the factors that impacted the participants by engaging in qualitative research using participant interviews. Finally, we will study the neuro response before and after the intervention. When the trial is concluded, we will disseminate the intervention to the wait-list controls as well as other institutions for a broad dissemination. Our work aims to improve the culture for postdocs, fellows, and junior faculty in the biomedical research workforce and to promote inclusive excellence."

5.8 million individuals miss or delay medical care because of a lack of transportation. Persons with end stage
kidney disease (ESKD) particularly depend on reliable transportation to dialysis sessions. In 2022, 84% of
individuals newly diagnosed with ESKD initiated their treatment at an in-center hemodialysis (HD) facility,
requiring they travel three times a week for HD. Yet 10% of patients with ESKD treated with HD miss dialysis at
least monthly, and 35% miss treatment at least once every three months. Missing dialysis has significant
individual and health system consequences, including increased emergency department visits,
hospitalizations, and premature mortality and contributes to persistent racial and socioeconomic disparities in
ESKD prevalence and outcomes. This Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) will
provide me with the training and mentorship needed to become an independent clinician-investigator and
leader on transportation insecurity, social risk, and healthcare access for patients with ESKD. I am a family
physician and medical anthropologist trained in qualitative and health services research and bring a unique
perspective on how individual and community social context impacts healthcare. To achieve my long-term
research and career goal of improving patients’ access to health care services and addressing longstanding
health inequities, I need additional skills in (1) epidemiologic design and advanced quantitative analysis skills;
(2) policy development and evaluation in transportation and ESKD, with emphasis on quality metrics; (3)
clinical intervention development and implementation of future transportation solutions. I will accomplish the
study’s goals through the following aims.
 Aim 1: Quantify social risk levels in a diverse group of patients with ESKD treated with in-center HD
 and associations with key HD outcomes in a prospective cohort study of 300 patients using the
 Accountable Health Communities (AHC) instrument.
 Aim 2: Assess the predictive validity of a novel transportation screening tool, the Transportation
 Security Index (TSI), in HD settings to identify patients most likely to miss HD appointments and
 compare its performance to the AHC’s transportation question.
 Aim 3: Identify facilitators and barriers to home dialysis as a component of addressing transportation
 insecurity in the ESKD population by conducting semi-structured interviews with patients, dialysis staff,
 and policy makers.
The current proposal aligns with NIDDK’s priority area of developing interventions to integrate social and
medical care to improve health equity and will break new ground by evaluating social risk within the ESKD
population, with a focus on transportation insecurity."
10944852,"The distinctive features of humanity—our intelligence, creativity, language, as well as our ecological and
demographic success—are thought to be the result of evolutionary changes elicited by several non-mutually
exclusive genetic mechanisms. One means by which this may be achieved is through the action of ancient DNA
sequence that have undergone rapid evolution specifically in the human lineage. These sequences—called
human accelerated regions (HARs)—have since been shown to be almost exclusively non-coding sequences.
Of HARs that have been evaluated functionally, 30 to 50% are transcriptional enhancers. It has been
hypothesized that rapid evolution of these HAR enhancers in the human lineage has driven changes in gene
expression that ultimately yielded useful human-specific traits. In support, a handful of HAR enhancers have
been shown to regulate neighboring genes in a temporal and/or spatial-specific manner. However, to date, none
of the identified >3000 HARs have been definitively shown to confer human-specific traits. This application is
focused on one particular HAR—called “HAR123”—that has characteristics that we believe make it a strong
candidate to confer human-specific traits. HAR123 is a neural enhancer highly conserved in mammals and
marsupials, but has undergone rapid evolution specifically in the human lineage. HAR123 strongly promotes
the generation of human neural progenitor cells (NPCs). In support of human HAR123 having human-specific
functions, we found—through single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) analysis—that human HAR123 drives
cellular and molecular events that differ from those elicited by chimpanzee HAR123. To examine its function in
vivo, we deleted HAR123 in mice and found that this causes a specific defect in cognitive flexibility, as determined
by two independent behavioral tests. Together, these data lead to our central hypothesis that HAR123 is an
ancient neural enhancer that has acquired new properties in the human lineage, leading to changes in gene
expression that impact NPC generation and, ultimately, cognitive flexibility. In this application, we propose to
address this central hypothesis. Towards this goal, we will elucidate the cellular and molecular functions of
mouse, chimpanzee, and human HAR123. Aim 1: to decipher the roles of HAR123 in human neural cells,
including NPCs, with a focus on how HAR123 acts as an enhancer. We will investigate how human HAR123
differs—at both the cellular and molecular level—from chimpanzee HAR123 in its impact on NPC genesis and
neural development. Our planned studies are designed to elucidate the selective forces that have acted on
HAR123 during primate evolution. Aim 2: to elucidate the neural roles of HAR123 in vivo. In this Aim, we will
investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the intriguing cognitive flexibility defect we have
defined in HAR123-KO mice. Through behavioral, cellular, and molecular analyses of human and chimp
HAR123 knock-in mice, we will elucidate the evolving functions of HAR123 in an in vivo context. The proposed
research addresses a fundamental question that is currently a black box in the field."

Lung recipients suffer from shorter life spans and higher rejection rates when compared to other solid organ 
recipients. Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is the most common cause of chronic lung transplant 
rejection. Based on clinical outcome studies that have identified many known non-alloimmune mediators of 
epithelial injury as risk factors for BOS, we have developed a new mouse orthotopic lung transplant model that 
recapitulates this relationship. This innovation has allowed us to a identify a key airway epithelial cell progenitor, 
the club cell, as vital for the maintenance of allograft tolerance and the prevention of obliterative bronchiolitis 
(OB) - the major pathological indicator of BOS. We have also observed that OB is driven by graft-infiltrating 
effector CD8+ T cells that inhibit club cell-mediated repair of airway epithelium. New data from our laboratory
suggests that follicular cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, a poorly defined CD8+ T cell subset with no reported role in solid 
organ transplantation, may facilitate responses against pulmonary-self antigens. Our group has previously 
reported that CCR2+ monocytes (CM) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) play critical roles in both lung 
transplant ischemia-reperfusion injury and the induction of lung allograft tolerance, but their role in the 
maintenance of tolerance remains unclear. We have now uncovered evidence implicating graft-infiltrating CM 
and NETs in OB pathogenesis. Here we propose to dissect the mechanisms by which CM (Aim 1), effector 
CD8+ T cells (Aim 2) and NETs (Aim 3) promote OB pathogenesis. We will also examine how CM and NETs 
shape effector CD8+ T cell responses that promote OB pathogenesis. Through these studies, we expect to 
reveal targetable pathways that promote BOS."

Breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) is associated with poor prognoses and dismal survival of 4-6 months
following diagnosis. Management of BCBM remains a major clinical challenge due to inadequate understanding
of the mechanisms underlying BCBM and the lack of drugs with effective blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration.
Thus, there is an urgent unmet need to identify actionable drug targets for BCBM and develop novel therapies
for treating patients with BCBM. Rearranged during transfection (RET) receptor tyrosine kinase is
hyperactivated in thyroid and non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC); two RET inhibitors, selpercatinib and
pralsetinib received FDA approval in 2020 for treating thyroid cancer and NSCLC. Both RET inhibitors reduced
brain metastases in the NSCLC clinical trials; however, their efficacy in BCBM is still unknown. Since it has been
reported that RET is overexpressed in BCBM and RET inhibitors (selpercatinib and pralsetinib) cross the BBB,
we conducted preliminary studies and found that selpercatinib significantly reduced BCBM incidence when
administered one day following intracardiac inoculation of tumor cells. However, selpercatinib did not significantly
suppress progression of developed BCBM in our treatment mouse model, which suggests the need to identify
pathways/genes that confer the resistance of established BCBM to RET inhibition. To identify pathways co-
activated with RET, we analyzed publicly available breast cancer datasets and found correlations between RET
and truncated glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (tGLI1), a known mediator of BCBM progression.
Through chemical screens followed by preclinical validations, a previous study identified FDA-approved
antifungal ketoconazole (KCZ) selectively inhibited tGLI1-driven BCBM in vivo with excellent BBB permeability,
leading to a window-of-opportunity clinical trial with BCBM. Our preliminary studies further revealed that (i)
activated RET and tGLI1 are preferentially co-overexpressed in BCBM tissues compared to matched primary
tumors, (ii) tGLI1 overexpression enhances resistance of brain-tropic breast cancer cells to RET inhibitors in
vitro, (iii) tGLI1 knockdown sensitizes brain-tropic breast cancer cells to RET inhibition, and (iv) RET inhibitors
synergize with KCZ in vitro. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that tGLI1 mediates BCBM resistance to
RET inhibition, and dual targeting of RET and tGLI1 synergistically inhibits BCBM. In this R21 project, we will
determine the role of tGLI1 in BCBM resistance to RET monotherapy (Aim 1), determine if dual targeting of RET
and tGLI1 synergistically inhibits BCBM using intracardiac injection mouse model, and elucidate the pathway
crosstalk between RET and tGLI1 (Aim 2)."

Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is an escalating crisis in healthcare that threatens to fundamentally alter
modern medicine. Among several prevalent mechanisms of resistance, intrinsic multidrug efflux pumps of the
Resistance-Nodulation-cell Division RND superfamily are broadly distributed among pathogenic bacteria
(particularly Gram-negatives) and contribute extensively to clinical resistance. The important opportunistic
pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes multiple RND efflux systems, at least four of which contribute to
its intrinsic multi-drug resistance. P. aeruginosa can cause both acute and chronic infections in susceptible
individuals that are thus notoriously difficult to treat once established. The P. aeruginosa multi-drug RND pumps
possess overlapping but distinct antibiotic substrate specificities, e.g., MexAB-OprM is selective for b-lactams
and MexXY-OprM for aminoglycosides, while both can efflux macrolides and other drugs. Expression of the P.
aeruginosa RND efflux system MexXY-OprM is also distinct in that it is upregulated in response to
aminoglycoside antibiotics. However, the molecular bases of gene regulation via aminoglycoside treatment and
aminoglycoside substrate selection for efflux are currently not known. The Specific Aims of this collaborative and
interdisciplinary proposal will generate a comprehensive new understanding of MexXY-OprM gene regulation,
structure and activity. This program will involve five researchers with highly complementary expertise in ribosome
stalling/ structural biology (Dunham and Keiler); computational/ structural biology and aminoglycoside activity/
resistance (Conn and Dey); and, bacterial genetics and P. aeruginosa biology (Grabowicz and Goldberg). The
two complementary, but independent, Specific Aims will: Aim 1–Uncover novel aspects of P. aeruginosa
physiology to define the cellular and molecular processes that lead to MexXY expression upon aminoglycoside
treatment; Aim 2–Determine the molecular basis of aminoglycoside uptake, selection, and efflux through the
MexXY-OprM transporter protein, MexY. Collectively, these studies will reveal important new aspects of P.
aeruginosa biology and identify multiple potential new strategies for new anti-pseudomonal development. Our
studies will also have broader implications for understanding the biology and potential therapeutic targeting of
RND efflux pumps in other important human pathogenic bacteria."

 Heart failure leads to >1.4 million hospitalizations annually in the U.S. During these acute decompensated
heart failure (ADHF) hospitalizations, the kidneys’ health influences almost every aspect of management,
including initial diuretic dosing, treatment intensification, and discharge planning. However, clinical reliance on
serum creatinine, an insensitive, nonspecific and often misleading kidney biomarker, substantially contributes
to suboptimal ADHF treatment. Although guidelines suggest that clinicians use the patient’s kidney function as
an indicator for the initial diuretic dose, the creatinine is actually a poor predictor of diuretic response and
clinicians must resort to “trial and error” in searching for each patient’s optimal dose. Further, although
creatinine elevations during treatment commonly reflect beneficial effects, clinicians typically de-escalate
diuresis from fear of worsening kidney damage. During discharge planning, this fear also drives clinicians to
prescribe an oral diuretic dose that is too low, and to avoid beneficial therapies. These obstacles to ideal care
culminate in delayed symptom relief, prolonged hospitalization, frequent readmissions, and high mortality risk.
 Given the kidney tubules’ central role in determining the effectiveness and safety of ADHF pharmacological
treatment, clinicians need tools that capture kidney tubule health to optimize diuretic strategies, improve
delivery of guideline-directed medical therapy, and minimize the risk for true kidney damage. In ambulatory
settings, our team has demonstrated the remarkable ability of tubule health measures to detect kidney damage
early, to reflect the kidneys’ response to treatment more accurately that creatinine, and to predict long-term
outcomes. Early studies of a few tubule markers in ADHF show that they improve in proportion to diuretic
response and have tremendous potential to change how kidney health is monitored during ADHF treatment.
 Given the central role of kidney health in ADHF treatment and prognosis, our overall goals are to
fundamentally change how clinicians approach kidney health monitoring and clinical decision-making during
ADHF treatment. To achieve these goals, we will capitalize on the well-characterized Mechanisms of Diuretic
Resistance (MDR) Study, a cohort of patients hospitalized for ADHF who have undergone serial biospecimen
collections timed to diuretic treatment throughout hospitalization with longitudinal follow-up for key clinical
outcomes. We will measure a broad panel of kidney biomarkers that reflect tubule reabsorptive and secretory
functions, injury, synthetic and reparative capacity, and tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis. We will
identify which tubule health measures most effectively: 1) predict treatment response to initial loop diuretic
dosing and adjunctive diuretic therapy (Aim 1); 2) discern pseudo- from intrinsic kidney damage among
patients with creatinine elevations during treatment (Aim 2); and 3) identify patients appropriate for discharge
and distinguish their risks for subsequent adverse events (Aim 3). This project will lay the necessary
groundwork for a clinical trial to test a kidney biomarker-guided ADHF treatment strategy."

Research on Alzheimer’s disease has strongly focused on pathological alterations such as plaques and tangles,
and has overlooked the functional consequences of neuronal firing. Compelling evidence from animal models
and basic science investigations have shown that functional consequences of Alzheimer’s disease
proteinopathy starts even before the beta-amyloid (Aβ) and tau form into detectable pathological aggregates.
Abnormal neuronal firing patterns in individuals during the predementia stage of Alzheimer’s disease therefore
may signify the presence of incipient neurodegenerative processes. Neural oscillations detected from
electrophysiological techniques with high spatiotemporal resolution such as magnetoencephalography (MEG)
have the potential to detect and quantify subtle changes in abnormal neuronal firing patterns in the human brain.
To pursue novel directions and fill important knowledge gaps in the field, the proposed project is aimed to
elucidate the role of neuronal dysfunction and hyperexcitability in the early biological progression of Alzheimer’s
disease. Defining the electrophysiological signatures in the predementia stage of Alzheimer’s disease will identify
the earliest neural circuit abnormalities, broaden the current conceptualizations of disease pathogenesis, and
provide novel insights for early interventional clinical trials. We will conduct a longitudinal, multimodal imaging
study, including clinical cohorts of Aβ+predementia individuals (Aβ+ cognitively unimpaired, Aβ+CU and Aβ+
mild cognitive impairment, Aβ+MCI) and Aβ− CU controls. Participants will be assessed at bassline and at 2-
year follow-up. Aβ-positron emission tomography (PET) at baseline will determine the Aβ+/− status in each
participant, and multimodal neuroimaging (MEG, tau-PET, MRI), and clinical evaluations will be performed at
baseline and at 2-years. Our central hypothesis is that, in the presence of Aβ, regional neural circuit
hyperexcitability contributes to progression of Alzheimer’s disease tauopathy and cognitive decline. We will
address two specific aims: AIM-1 will identify the earliest manifestations of neural circuit hyperexcitability that
will predict accumulation of regional tau in Aβ+predementia, and also will define the role of specific excitatory
and inhibitory neuronal subpopulation abnormalities as mediators of tau accumulation. AIM-2 will determine the
earliest manifestations of neural circuit hyperexcitability that will predict cognitive deficits that can be detected in
Aβ+predementia. This project will determine the critical role of neuronal hyperexcitability in early Alzheimer’s
disease pathogenesis in the human brain and develop a framework to assess neural circuit hyperexcitability in
the earliest disease stages. The findings will help link cellular findings from basic science to clinical disease in
patients with Alzheimer’s disease. By establishing the role of network hyperexcitability in Alzheimer’s disease
progression this study will uncover the potential of neural circuit hyperexcitability as a novel modifiable
therapeutic target in Alzheimer’s disease."
10944113,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT: Survival with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) has improved in the last
decade alongside the trend of an aging population with greater risks, including cancer. Therefore, optimal
management for patients with both ESKD and cancer (affecting at least 7% of the > 130,000 annual incident
ESKD patients) is of increasing public health importance. Kidney transplantation confers substantial survival
benefit over dialysis for patients with ESKD, but the immunosuppression doubles the risk of cancer compared
to the general population. Nephrologists face a dilemma to when evaluating transplant candidates who have a
previous history of cancer, because while most active malignancies are considered a contraindication to
transplantation due to high mortality risk, the recommended waiting time to transplant for patients in remission
is based largely on expert opinion and low-grade evidence. The resulting uncertainty in the context of the
current organ shortage makes providers reluctant to transplant kidney patients with a history of cancer. Yet, for
many of these patients, the risk of dying while on dialysis likely exceeds the risk conferred by their cancer
recurrence. There are little data available to transplant centers to guide decisions about listing patients with
kidney failure in remission from cancer, and nephrologists face a critical need to better serve patients with
ESKD by improving predictions of pre- and post-transplant outcomes. This proposal will provide personalized
risk estimates to nephrologists in a clinically useful, publicly available format. Models will estimate the “tipping
point” for an individual, when the risk of waiting longer for surveillance exceeds the risk of immunosuppression.
These estimates will be communicated in a free, user-friendly, online tool for use by transplant programs to
precisely guide decisions about listing kidney transplant candidates with a history of cancer. Multiple data
sources with be used to address potential bias: The United States Renal Data System (USRDS), Transplant
Cancer Match (TCM) Study, and US cancer registries. Aim 1 will estimate mortality risk in waitlisted kidney
transplant candidates with a history of cancer, comparing those who are transplanted vs. not yet transplanted
using data from the TCM Study. Aim 2 will estimate mortality risk in ESKD patients with a history of cancer who
are not yet listed for transplant, compared to patients in the TCM Study who were transplanted, using a novel
linkage between the USRDS database and US cancer registries. Aim 3 will develop a Clinician Decision
Support website that incorporates the mortality estimates developed in Aims 1 and 2 into a free user-friendly,
online interface for nephrologists to use in transplant candidate waitlisting decisions. This proposal fills an
immediate need to inform decisions that balance the risk of death on dialysis with the risk of cancer recurrence
after transplant. The novel database linkage also creates wide-ranging potential for future investigations into
the association between ESKD and cancer. Thus, this proposal aligns well with the NIDDK mission to improve
the lives of patients with chronic kidney disease, and will extend the scientific reach of the USRDS."

Reproductive challenges are a growing concern worldwide, marked by a 50% decline in fertility rates over the
past 50 years. Approximately 10% of couples face infertility, affecting both men and women. A condition called
azoospermia, where semen lacks sperm, impacts up to 20% of infertile men. Azoospermia is categorized into
obstructive and non-obstructive types, and assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are often necessary.
Microdissection testicular sperm extraction (microTESE) is the preferred surgical method for non-obstructive
azoospermia but relies on time-consuming manual examination of samples under an optical microscope.
Furthermore, it has been shown that in some cases of non-obstructive azoospermia, rare sperm may exist in the
ejaculate, but they can only be identified through laborious manual searches of large-volume samples. Such
occurrences can potentially save these individuals from undergoing microTESE surgery. The need for an
accurate, reliable, and consistent method for sperm identification and retrieval is crucial for improving the
chances of men with azoospermia having biological children. While microfluidics and machine learning have
shown potential, they face limitations. Microfluidic solutions suffer from usability and design complexity issues,
while machine learning struggles with domain bias. None of the existing systems are suitable for replacing
manual sperm examination, highlighting the ongoing need for a clinically viable method to retrieve sperm
efficiently and reliably from testicular biopsies, aspirates, and severe factor ejaculated specimens
(oligozoospermia/cryptozoospermia).
To address these challenges, our proposed approach includes two components:
 1. A microwell device designed to digitize cells in ejaculated samples from men with low sperm counts
 (cryptozoospermia) and microTESE samples. This device creates confined nanowells for efficient sperm
localization.
 2. A robust deep learning framework tailored to handle diverse and heterogeneous data, enabling swift and
 precise detection of rare sperm."

Poor oral health is a national symbol of social inequity, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations.
Despite its profound impact on overall well-being, oral health remains disjointed from medical care delivery. As
a result, vulnerable adults often resort to emergency departments (ED) for treatment of non-traumatic dental
conditions (NTDCs), leading to suboptimal care, clinician frustration, increased ED crowding, and high health
costs. The purpose of this proposal is to use electronic health record (EHR) data to better identify adults likely to
seek treatment in EDs for NTDCs. Aim 1, Leverage multi-health systems’ EHR data to predict ED use for NTDCs,
will use EHR data from multiple hospital systems and novel social determinants of health data (measured at the
individual- and community-level) in a series of advanced machine learning (ML) prediction models. This aim will
identify the value of medical and social determinants data in predicting oral health needs. Aim 2, Extract oral
health predictors from the clinical notes of medical encounters that occur prior to ED use, will apply natural
language processing techniques to create novel data reflective of medical care providers’ documentation of oral
health. This aim will create new data for use in prediction modeling. Aim 3, Assess the feature importance within,
and the predictive performance of, ML prediction models built on structured and unstructured EHR data, will test
the contributions of unstructured and structured data source in prediction models designed to identify adults at
risk of using the ED for NTDCs. Furthermore, the mentorship and rigorous training plan proposed in this career
development award application will enable Dr. Heather Taylor to become an independent investigator capable
of using advanced health informatics approaches to enhance the delivery of oral health services, particularly for
underserved populations. To achieve her career goals, Dr. Taylor seeks 1) technical training in the application
of machine-learning, including natural language processing, 2) knowledge development in health disparities
research, and 3) enhanced professional development and grant writing skills. Dr. Taylor has assembled a
diverse, interdisciplinary panel of mentors to foster her proposed career development and research plan. She is
supported by a resource-rich institutional environment with access to one of the nation’s oldest and largest
clinical EHR data repositories. This study is innovative because it utilizes data collected outside of traditional
dental care settings to provide health systems with actionable information about adults in their community who
need support navigating the oral-medical divide. The anticipated products of this research include the
development and validation of risk prediction models that identify patients who experience poor oral health and
require targeted support. After completion, Dr. Taylor plans to transition to research independence and submit
an R01 focusing on optimizing risk predictions for ED use related to NTDCs within health systems and connecting
identified adults to definitive dental care."
10950976,"Chronic pain costs the US more than $635 billion per year, however, patients fail to receive adequate relief
from the available drugs and often become drug-dependent. These observations highlight the importance for
identifying new agents acting on unique targets to treat chronic pain. Genetic, neurobiological, and preclinical
studies have suggested that adenylyl cyclase type 1 (AC1) may provide that new drug target. AC1 knock out
mice (AC1-/-) show reduced or absent inflammatory and neuropathic pain when compared to littermate controls.
Preclinical studies with a small molecule inhibitor of AC1, NB001 revealed that NB001 reduced chronic pain
responses (i.e. inflammatory and neuropathic) in both mice and rats. Similarly, we have recently shown that a
novel AC1 inhibitor, ST034307 also reduced inflammatory pain in a mouse model. These studies are consistent
with the premise that AC1 is a new target for inhibitors of chronic pain. Unfortunately, both NB001 and ST034307
have significant issues and liabilities preventing further development. To that end, we have recently screened a
chemical library collection that allowed us to identify a pyrimidinone scaffold for the development of novel AC1
inhibitors. This scaffold was prioritized for hit-to-lead optimization based on several promising criteria. Preliminary
structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies have revealed for the first time compounds with sub-micromolar
potency at AC1, as well as selectivity versus the closely-related AC8. Further, initial in vivo studies with a more
soluble pyrimidinone benzlamine analog revealed analgesic activity in an animal model of chronic pain. Despite
these promising observations, the inhibitory mechanism is unknown. The effect of chronic treatment with our
lead compounds on cAMP signaling and opioid receptor modulation of AC1 are also unknown. We propose a
molecular pharmacology characterization of our lead inhibitors of AC1 activity under the following Goals: Goal 1
will use site-directed mutagenesis to examine how the regulatory properties (e.g. Ca2+/CaM, Gαs, and forskolin)
influence to the activity of the inhibitors. Goal 2 will establish the pharmacological activity using an in vitro model
to explore the effects of AC1 inhibition on m opioid receptor regulation of cAMP accumulation under both acute
and chronic conditions. The studies will significanlty and rationally expand Aim 2 of the parent R01 providing
insight regarding the potential Ca2+/CaM-dependent and -independent mechanisms for AC1 inhibition. Further,
the studies in Goal 2 will be instrumental in understanding the translational components of the original Aim 3 by
assessing efficacy, tolerance, and dependence using in vitro models."

Significant research has gone into the development of a safe and effective vaccine for HIV-1.
Although many strategies have been attempted; none has been successfully established. Even a
partially effective vaccine could decrease the number of people who are infected with HIV, further
reducing the number of people who can pass the virus on to others. By substantially reducing the
number of new infections, we could eventually stop the pandemic. To date, the elicitation of
broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) has proven extremely difficult to achieve which brought
a lot of effort on the novel trimer design and modification. At the same time, it was found that
induced HIV- specific CD8+ T cell responses could limit both the transmission and establishment
of persistent viral reservoirs. All the evidence suggest that no individual factor will determine the
ultimate success of a bNAb-inducing HIV-1 vaccine, which will likely require a combination of
efficient precursor B cell priming, optimization of Env design and presentation, sustained
heterologous Env boosting, a T cell-based strategy, and newly developed delivery systems or
adjuvants. Adjuvants or delivery systems can stimulate different arms of the immune system and
are vital components of subunit vaccines, especially in the case of poorly immunogenic envelope
glycoprotein. Deliver systems can also be designed to address instability of mRNA-based
vaccines. The goal of this program is therefore to overcome challenges with HIV-1 vaccination
and deliver a safe and effective vaccine using a biocompatible, biodegradable, easily
manufactured short carbon nanotube (CNTVac) platform. Env-trimer and mRNA encoding
peptide will be antigens for delivery and will target generation of both humoral and cellular
responses. A humanized mouse model and a non-human primate model will be used for
immunogenicity and efficacy studies. As the novel non-viral gene transfer vector for HIV-1 vaccine
delivery, we will establish methodology for potential GMP production and generate safety profiles
under FDA requirements."
10948390,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT.
Novel vaccination strategies are necessary to contain the TB pandemic, as the currently licensed anti-tubercular
vaccine, Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), has limited and variable efficacy. Attenuated, live-replicating
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) express the full complement of protective antigens not present in BCG. As a
result, these strains are most likely to induce long-lived immune responses and generate durable protection.
Rhesus macaques vaccinated with an isogenic Mtb mutant in the allele encoding the stress-response master
regular SigH (DsigH) were protected from TB after infection with a lethal dose of Mtb, and characterized by the
presence of inducible bronchus associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) and robust T cell responses in the lungs.
Protection by DsigH could be reversed by the depletion of CD20+ B cells which ablates iBALT. Protection with
DsigH was validated in cynomolgus macaques, a second NHP species used as a model for TB vaccination.
Preliminary data presented in this proposal indicates that protection elicited by DsigH is based on the generation
of very early, potent, innate immune responses in the lung that drive rigorous immune dynamics and interactions.
We propose to use cutting-edge techniques that our group has optimized, such as single cell RNA sequencing
in airways and lungs, PET/CT scans of whole animals and single cell imaging, to fully understand elite lung
responses generated by DsigH compared to Mtb. Our proposed work will not only provide in-depth knowledge
of immune responses generated by a potential human intervention for TB, but also identify mechanisms by which
Mtb infection can be sterilized prior to the formation of the granuloma."

quality measurement and community-based mental health services research, The approach is one that
the NCQA team has been working on since 2013 in the context of care for older adults and people with
multiple chronic health conditions, The approach is innovative in combining personalization of goals for
individual service users with a method, known as goal-attainment scaling, for tracking progress on goals
in a standardized quantitative way that can be used in an outcome measure, NCQA's prior work has been
successful in developing measures that are being implemented in several accreditation programs, The
proposed project will take the approach developed in the prior work and develop measures specific to
community based treatment for adults with SML To do this we will collect quantitative and qualitative
data from seven Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics in Texas and Arizona that began
implementing the measures in the fall of 2022, as part of an NCQA learning collaborative, The data will
be used to assess the measures with respect to the measure endorsement criteria for CMS's Measures
Under Consideration process and the new criteria set forth by Battelle's Partnership for Quality
Measurement The quantitative data will be used to assess the reliability and validity of the measures
and explore strategies for risk adjustment and stratification, Qualitative data, including interviews with
clinicians, administrators, and service users with experience with the measures. The inclusion of a
Service User Working Group, a panel of 8 individuals with experience receiving mental health care in
community mental health settings like those being studied, will provide an important perspective on the
measures, Developing these measures will provide an assessment approach, complementary to
conventional symptom-based outcome measures, that assesses delivery of person centered care in the
context of long-term recovery-oriented treatment of SMI, filling a gap in behavioral health quality
measurement identified in the literature,

The question of why animals sleep has puzzled scientists for over a century. Contemporary research suggests
that sleep serves as a compensatory mechanism for brain plasticity, restoring the network to a homeostatic set-
point known as criticality. However, the precise mechanisms between sleep and neural plasticity are still subjects
of intense debate, and the information processing aspect of this problem hasn’t been addressed experimentally.
This proposal aims to address this gap by positing the hypothesis that experience-dependent plasticity in
neuronal circuitry progressively undermines indices of an optimal computational regime, and
proportionally increases the likelihood of sleep.
 I will adopt a two-pronged approach, leveraging the diverse expertise of my mentorship team. The first
objective is to develop a machine learning algorithm that predicts the mechanisms of neural criticality and its
homeostasis. This model will challenge existing machine learning approaches, which often lack explanatory
power, by extracting dynamical rules from existing datasets using cutting-edge modeling and optimization
techniques. The second objective involves empirical testing to ascertain whether a plasticity threshold exists at
the network level that triggers sleep. This will be conducted through continuous neuronal recordings in freely
behaving mice, coupled with methods to induce plastic change in the network.
 The third objective is to construct a biophysically grounded mathematical model to identify mechanisms
that stabilize network information processing in the face of plastic changes. This model will incorporate methods
from control theory and dynamical systems and will be validated against the rules derived in the first objective
and the data collected in the second objective. This interdisciplinary project is groundbreaking in its attempt to
offer a dynamical and mathematical explanation for why plasticity requires sleep. Furthermore, in contrast to
many other works that focus on either theory or experiment, here I will support my theoretical work with empirical
data.
 Overall, the project promises to make significant contributions to both theoretical and applied
neuroscience. It seeks to develop a predictive model for sleep/wake behavior based on fundamental rules and
to elucidate the functional mechanisms by which sleep serves the healthy brain. By directly testing a
dynamical/mathematical explanation of why plasticity requires sleep, the project stands to resolve a long-
standing question in neuroscience. Furthermore, uncovering these mechanisms will fill the important gap of
adaptation for a possible fundamental framework of brain dynamics."

Several recurrent, relatively common copy number variants (CNVs) have been shown to confer significant risk
for neuropsychiatric disorders (NPD). These CNVs are under-identified in the general population and under-
characterized with respect to the broad range of possible phenotypic manifestation and penetrance. The
15q13.3 BP4-5 recurrent deletion (15q13.3DS) confers risk for early onset NPDs such as autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) and intellectual developmental disorder (IDD), What is less clear is the impact of this CNV on
NPDs with later onset, such as major depressive disorder(MDD), bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, as well
as numerous other later-onset medical and neurological conditions such as epilepsy, and neurodegenerative
disorders. Similarly, little is known about the relationship between ASD-associated CNVs and potentially
clinically relevant dimensional neurobehavioral traits among carriers who do not meet full clinical criteria for an
early onset NPD. There is a need to characterize a wider population base to better understand the penetrance
of these CNVs, along with other potentially associated medical, psychiatric, and neurological phenotypes.
There are likely additional factors (such as underlying polygenic risk) that may impact the phenotypic
expression of these variants that already exist in the information already collected. We will identify a cohort of
200 individuals with 15q13.3DS with access to their electronic heath records(EHR). We will recruit 75
individuals for deeper quantitative phenotyping. We will identify additional clinical characteristics in addition to
confirming the currently known phenotypes associated with 15q13.3DS by leveraging available longitudinal
EHRs. We will then combine the EHR data with the quantitative phenotypic data that we have collected using
well-referenced and validated tools to create a deep dataset. This dataset will then be used to train and
systematically test a predictive algorithm of 15q13.3DS diagnosis and risk prediction for penetrance of its
various manifestations. To complete these series of studies as part of a K23 Mentored Career Development
Award Dr. Soda will work with a team of mentors with complementary skillsets, complete relevant coursework
towards a biomedical informatics certificate, and participate in related practicum experiences. This will help Dr.
Soda meet his training aims; 1. Learn to operate in, manage, harmonize complex health-related data through
biomedical informatics. 2. Learn the skills needed to conduct genomic analysis on the effect of rare as well as
common variants found in the genome and its relation to symptom penetrance. 3. Learn advanced analysis of
biomedical data with machine learning techniques. The completion of this proposal will uncover previously
unknown syndrome presentations, identify factors related to psychiatric disorder penetrance in individuals with
15q13.3DS and will lay the groundwork for Dr. Soda to achieve independence towards R01 funding to assess
the sensitivity/ specificity of such developed tools in identifying individuals with rare genetic syndromes."

Alcohol’s effects on the body are complex, altering behaviors, emotions and physiology. These effects all
contribute to the cycle of alcohol use and abuse that leads to alcohol use disorders (AUDs). They also
contribute to the development of comorbid psychiatric disorders, like panic disorder (PD), which are common.
Comorbidity is associated with worse patient outcomes, yet little is known regarding the pathophysiology
regulating comorbidity. Emerging evidence supports dysregulated acid-base homeostasis may be a shared
mechanism in AUD and PD. Maintaining physiological homeostasis (e.g. neutral pH) is critical for survival, and
threats to homeostasis elicit behavioral, emotional and physiological responses directed toward this goal.
Alcohol use induces acidosis which is positively correlated with withdrawal severity. Strong evidence supports
dysregulated acid-sensing in PD, but its role in AUDs is not well understood. Our lab recently found a role for a
novel microglial acid-sensor T-cell death associated gene 8 (TDAG8) in panic-relevant behavior and
physiology. Interestingly, preliminary data show ethanol increases TDAG8-promoter driven GFP expression
and neuroinflammation in a TDAG8 dependent manner. Thus, TDAG8 and associated neuroimmune effectors
may provide a unique and novel shared mechanism for AUD and PD. The purpose of this K99-R00 proposal is
to determine if TDAG8 regulates AUD-associated outcomes (K99 phase) and contributes to development of
comorbid AUD-PD (R00 phase). My published and preliminary data support the hypothesis that microglial
TDAG8 regulates behaviors (ethanol consumption) and physiological (respiratory/cardiovascular) responses
associated with alcohol use (K99), and that ethanol-evoked upregulation of TDAG8 increases susceptibility to
develop comorbid AUD-PD (R00 phase). Aim1 (K99 phase) will test the hypothesis that microglial acid-sensor
TDAG8 regulates ethanol consumption in the “drinking in the dark” (DID) voluntary binge drinking model. Aim 2
(K99 phase) will test the hypothesis that TDAG8 mediates cardiovascular (blood pressure, heart rate, heart
rate variability) and respiratory effects of alcohol use and withdrawal (acute and protracted abstinence). Aim 3
(R00 Phase) will test the hypothesis that alcohol dependence will increase panic-relevant behavioral and
physiological responses to CO2 inhalation (PD-relevant homeostatic stress) in a TDAG8-dependent manner.
Each aim will also investigate neuroinflammation. These aims will elucidate mechanisms of AUDs and
comorbidity with PD. Investigating the intersection of AUD and PD by focusing on shared physiological and
neuroimmune mechanisms will further our understanding of each disorder and lead to novel treatments. This
K99/R00 proposal will provide training in mouse models of AUDs, methods for quantifying neuroinflammation,
and collection/analysis of physiological outcomes. Additionally, it will provide professional development that will
facilitate my transition to an independent academic research position. These aims will provide a foundation for
a successful independent career investigating pathophysiology of AUD and comorbid disorders like PD."

 Hearing loss is a major public health concern due to its negative association with emotional well-being,
cognition, and physical ailments, such as diabetes. Access to audiologists and otolaryngologists in many
regions across the US is poor or extremely limited. Rural populations are older, less educated, and have lower
household incomes compared to populations in metropolitan areas. Also, with increasing age adults
experience greater rates of hearing loss. Fortunately, the 2022 FDA Final Rule for Over-the-Counter Hearing
Aids (OTC HAs) could revolutionize assess to hearing aids and hearing healthcare by allowing adults with
perceived mild-to-moderate hearing loss to purchase these devices over the counter, without medical
clearance or care from an audiologist. Pharmacies located in rural areas now have the option to provide OTC
HAs, something previously not possible. Currently, however, there are no established guidelines for effective
provision of these devices in pharmacies located in rural communities. Educating pharmacy technicians to
provide basic hearing healthcare related to OTC HAs use could address a critical need and create a new care
delivery model to ensure sustainable, long-term access to hearing healthcare. The long-term goal of this study
is to create a sustainable interprofessional collaborative between audiologists and pharmacists for the
development of a hearing healthcare model that improves access and affordability of care in rural regions
across the country. The specific aims are to 1) Determine an effective approach for educating pharmacy
technicians for the provision of OTC HAs in rural community pharmacies, and 2) Identify satisfaction of care
provided by pharmacy technicians and initial performance with OTC HAs in adults with hearing loss living in
rural communities. A stepped wedged clinical trial design will be used to study the effectiveness of a
comprehensive educational training program for pharmacy technicians. Technicians from rural Alabama and
Mississippi, placed within four different clusters, will participate in a multimodal training program for the
purpose of developing basic clinical skills to assist adults with perceived mild-to-moderate hearing loss.
Additionally, adults with hearing loss who receive clinical services from trained pharmacy technicians will be
asked to report on the care they received and benefit from their OTC HAs. The central hypotheses are a) that
pharmacy technician training will result in greater understanding of hearing healthcare concepts compared to
no training, and b) the training will lead to successful provision of basic hearing healthcare to adults with
hearing loss in rural communities. The expected outcome of this project will be the establishment of a
multimodal education program, leveraging the increased access of OTC HAs, to support those with hearing
loss in rural pharmacies across the county. The ability of pharmacy technicians to provide this support will
dramatically increase the availability of hearing services in rural communities, which will positively impact the
quality of life for those with hearing loss."
10949606,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Antibody and antibody fusion protein therapies targeting adaptive immune cells have
shown variable inter-subject levels of success at halting autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing
pancreatic β-cells in individuals recently diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). Responsiveness to many
antibody therapies vary in other autoimmune diseases and cancer according to Fc gamma receptor (FcγR)
variants impacting a patient’s capacity for Fc-mediated mechanisms of action (Fc-MoA) such as antibody
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). Indeed,
pharmacodynamics of low-dose α-thymocyte globulin (LD-ATG) and clinical efficacy of rituximab (α-CD20) have
been demonstrated to be affected by FcγR variants in the context of transplantation or rheumatoid arthritis and
lymphoma, respectively. However, whether responsiveness to these therapies in individuals with T1D are
similarly affected by FcγR-associated variants remains unknown. Therefore, I hypothesize that FcγR-associated
variants may influence efficacy of therapeutic antibodies with FcγR-binding capabilities in recent-onset T1D via
regulation of ADCC and ADCP. Indeed, I have identified a significant association between an FCGR2B
expression QTL (eQTL) and quantitative metabolic response (QR) in the LD-ATG trial (TN19). The objectives of
my proposed studies are to build on this finding by identifying genetic variants in FcγR loci that associate with
therapeutic efficacy in additional completed T1D immunotherapy trials and to evaluate the consequences of
modified FcγR expression and/or function on Fc-MoA. In Aim 1, I will perform quantitative trait locus (QTL)
analysis of FcγR-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variants (CNVs) versus
treatment efficacy and target cell depletion in TrialNet (TN) and Immune Tolerance Network (ITN) studies of
native Fc-containing antibody therapeutics in recent-onset T1D. I will analyze associations between genotype
microarray, clinical endpoints, and flow cytometry data from the rituximab (TN05) and alefacept (Inducing
Remission in T1D With Alefacept [T1DAL], ITN) trials. In Aim 2, I will determine impacts of FcγR-associated
variants on cell type-specific FcγR protein expression and regulation of Fc-MoA of therapeutic antibodies for
T1D. Here, I will characterize human whole blood samples by flow cytometry to evaluate associations between
cell type-specific FcγR protein expression and previously defined whole blood eQTLs, with a focus on the LD-
ATG response-associated FCGR2B variant. I will also employ rapid and fluorometric ADCC (RFADCC) assays
to measure LD-ATG- and rituximab-mediated ADCC and ADCP induction by genotype-selected natural killer
(NK) cell and monocyte effectors and T cell or B cell targets, respectively. I expect my findings will support a
precision medicine approach to identify individuals with or at-risk for T1D who are likely to respond positively to
native Fc-containing immunotherapies, as well as to guide dose optimization strategies for non-responders."

E-cigarettes are the most popular nicotine-delivery devices used by US adolescents. Many adolescents do not
like being addicted to e-cigarettes and want to quit. However, there are no empirically validated interventions to
help them quit using e-cigarettes. We have developed an adolescent-focused smartphone-app called Kick-Nic!©
that uses an engaging, multi-media rich, and interactive cognitive-behavioral therapy platform to teach coping
skills for e-cigarette-specific triggers and support cessation. App content to address e-cigarette appeal, quit
motivations, and coping skills, was developed using focus group evidence from 60 adolescent e-cigarette users.
The structure, format and design of the app was developed using iterative feedback from 14 adolescents. A
feasibility pilot with 19 adolescents who used the app, indicated that it was engaging, easy to use, and useful to
support e-cigarette quit efforts. An open label pilot is testing the use of the app with engagement methods
commonly used in digital interventions that were identified by youth as important for engagement [text message
reminders & weekly in-person check-ins]; 8 high school adolescents have initiated the trial, are completing all
app sessions, weekly check-ins, and assessments with 100% retention. The current proposal will:
Aim 1: Examine the efficacy of the Kick-Nic!© App: We will conduct an RCT with 306 adolescents in high
schools who use e-cigarettes regularly (>/=1 day/week in the past month) and want to quit. Adolescents will be
randomized to the ACTIVE (Kick-Nic!© App for eight weeks, along with text message reminders and weekly
virtual check-ins, & assessments) or the CONTROL condition (assessments alone with referrals to NCI Quit
Vaping webpage). E-cigarette use will be assessed at baseline, biweekly during treatment, and end of
treatment (EOT; 8 weeks), and then at 1, 2, 3 and 6 month follow ups (FU). Salivary cotinine levels </= 30
ng/ml) will verify self-reports of abstinence at EOT and 6-month FU. We will explore changes in other tobacco
and cannabis use behaviors. Our primary outcome will be 7-day, biochemically verified, point-prevalence
abstinence (PPA) rates at 6-months, and secondary outcomes include 7-day PPA at EOT, % days e-cig free
(during treatment, at EOT, 3 and 6 mths FU) and continuous abstinence (at EOT, 3 and 6 mths FU). We will also
examine the impact of app engagement, coping skill knowledge, and baseline variables (nicotine dependence, e-cig
use frequency, sex) and other tobacco product use on outcomes. Aim 2: Identify strategies for
dissemination and implementation of the app within schools. Individual qualitative interviews with up to
50% of youth in the ACTIVE condition will examine likeability of the app and engagement methods used, how to
disseminate the app to youth in school settings. Interviews with 20 school staff/administrators will examine how
the app could be implemented and used within the school setting. Thus, this innovative proposal will support
the testing, as well as dissemination and implementation within schools, of an appealing digital app that
addresses the critical need for an adolescent-focused e-cigarette cessation intervention."

The current approaches to prescribing medication to patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) involve a
‘trial and error’ approach to prescribing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) based on patient interview
and physician insight. Unfortunately, a high percentage of trials fail on the first try and after two or more ‘failed’
drug treatments, patients are considered “treatment resistant.” Relevant research has elucidated that
liver cytochrome P450 (CYPs) enzymes are responsible for carrying out a series of oxidations
that metabolize drugs as part of a pathway to excretion. As such, the expression of the 57 CYP enzymes coded
for by the CYP genes determines how rapid an individual metabolizes a particular drug and, not surprisingly, this
varies dramatically from one patient to another. This is important because ‘rapid metabolizers’ often DO NOT
hit the critical systemic thresholds needed of the drug to be effective, while ‘slow metabolizers’ tend to
accumulate drug and, hence, reach levels that are often toxic and riddled with side effects, including suicide. In
fact, clinical responses to the same dose of a drug can vary among individuals based on single nucleotide
variants (SNVs) in CYP genes, especially CYP2D6 which metabolizes up to >25% of all drugs prescribed today
in medical practice and plays an important role in targeted drug selection, optimization of dose, and prevention
of toxicity. CYP2C19 is another candidate enzyme, whose genetic variations are known to control the metabolism
of many phototropic medications. Despite a considerable public database containing genome-to-phenome
information on these enzymes, the only current method to interrogating those SNPs and their effect on
the ‘metabolizer status’ of a patient, is sequencing the patient sample in a clinical testing lab, which is costly and
slow (1-2 weeks), and during that time, if the prescribed treatment plan is ineffective, there can be serious
consequences for the patient. Hence, we propose to use these CYP alleles to define patient ‘metabolizer status’
as fast, moderate or slow, at the point of patient care and avoid the ‘trial and error’ approach. We will develop a
point-of-care (POC) rapid assay for the pharmacogenetic screening of MDD patients. This microdevice will
require minimal physician intervention beyond collection of a patient buccal swab and placement of the swab
into the system for swab-to-genotype analysis. In less than 1 hour, physicians will be endowed with actionable
data with regard to MDD therapy, including an SSRI therapeutic recommendation and dosing suggestion."

Tissue factor (TF) is the primary initiator of blood coagulation. The expression of TF from the F3 locus must be
intricately regulated in a cell type-specific manner to ensure hemostasis following injury but prevent pathologic
thrombosis. Indeed, aberrant intravascular TF expression contributes to myocardial infarction, venous
thromboembolism (VTE), and stroke, while studies across species demonstrate that reduced TF dosage may
predispose to bleeding or protect against thrombosis. Nevertheless, the genetic architecture regulating F3
expression across diverse human tissues and disease states is largely undefined. Our central hypothesis is
that rare human genetic variation in the F3 promoter (Aim 1), coding region (Aim 2), and 3’ untranslated region
(UTR, Aim 3) disrupts the tight regulation of TF expression and its procoagulant activity to influence human
bleeding and thrombotic risk. Our preliminary studies integrate genetic and biochemical approaches to identify
new activators and the first repressors of F3 transcription, microRNAs negatively regulating F3 mRNA through
its 3’ UTR, and rare human genetic variation in the sequence elements that enable these interactions. We also
characterize the first human missense mutations in TF that impact its interaction with factor VII and/or factor X
activation. Because routine clinical assays of blood coagulation do not reliably capture the role of endogenous
TF, these individuals go undetected in human populations. In Aim 1, we will evaluate new transcriptional
activators and repressors of the F3 promoter. We will map the multiple but finite ways a cell can turn on F3
across human tissues, and define rare human genetic variation perturbing this stringent regulation. In Aim 2,
we will evaluate an expanded cohort of individuals with F3 null mutations and damaging missense mutations to
determine their impact on blood coagulation, factor VII activation, and human disease. In Aim 3, we will
characterize the role of microRNAs that negatively regulate F3 expression. Among these, we have identified a
microRNA whose action is suppressed by a SNP that is overrepresented in young patients with penetrant
thrombosis, suggesting a potential mechanism of thrombophilia attributable to unrestricted TF expression. By
systematically evaluating human genetic variation in the F3 promoter, coding region, and 3’ UTR, our findings
will establish the first F3 genotype-phenotype relationships in humans and provide a new lens through which to
interpret increasingly common human genetic testing that incorporates F3. The findings suggest new
mechanisms of human bleeding and thrombotic risk, as well as new therapeutic avenues to specifically target
pathologic TF expression."

Of over 80,000 adolescents and young adults (AYA) diagnosed with cancer in the United States each year, 85%
live for at least five years after their cancer diagnosis. Adolescence and early young adulthood is a critical period
for frontal neurodevelopment, and cancer treatments potentially disrupt this neurodevelopment, leading to
cognitive deficits known as cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI). An estimated 53% of these long-term
early young adult (YA) survivors experience CRCI that interferes with their work and educational goals. However,
sparse research using objective neuropsychological assessment does not detect CRCI as reported by YA
survivors. Therefore, the goal of this K99/R00 application is to take the first step in an innovative program of
research to characterize CRCI among this vulnerable survivorship population using ecologically valid
assessments. Career Development Plan: The overall training objective is to provide Dr. Tometich with additional
training and mentorship to become a highly qualified independent investigator with expertise in CRCI in the
understudied population of AYA cancer survivors. Dr. Tometich’s training goals are to: 1) enhance her knowledge
of cancer and cognition in AYAs, 2) acquire skills in cognitive and behavioral assessment methodologies, 3)
develop proficiency in real-time longitudinal data analysis, and 4) continue professional development. During the
K99 phase, Dr. Tometich will work under the primary mentorship of Dr. Heather Jim at Moffitt Cancer Center (an
NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center) and co-mentorship of Dr. Brent Small. Experts in CRCI among
AYA survivors are lacking nationally; therefore, a mentorship and advisory team will provide complementary
expertise to address each aspect of the training and research content (additional advisors are Drs. Andrew
Galligan, Martin Sliwinski, and Dinorah Martinez Tyson). Research Plan: The goal of this study is to evaluate
long-term CRCI and potentially modifiable risk factors in YA survivors (i.e., age 18-30) using ecologically valid
assessments. An existing cognitive ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has been developed and used by
our research team in middle-aged breast cancer survivors, but it has not yet been applied in YA survivors.
Furthermore, actigraphy can objectively measure two modifiable risk factors for CRCI (physical activity and
sleep). In the K99 phase (i.e., Aims 1 and 2), we will use an iterative mixed-methods approach to tailor an EMA
of CRCI and situational, behavioral, and contextual risk factors (SBCF) to the experience of YAs based on
qualitative interviews with 20 YA survivors who report CRCI. We will then pilot the EMA and actigraphy in 25 YA
survivors and make revisions as needed. In the R00 phase (i.e., Aim 3), we will recruit 150 YA survivors and 150
community controls matched on gender, age, and education for a cross-sectional study to evaluate CRCI and
SBCF. Impact: The combined training and research plan will position Dr. Tometich to transition to independence
as one of the few cancer control investigators specializing in CRCI in the vulnerable and unique population of
AYA survivors."

Individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs) have a higher prevalence of mood and anxiety
disorders, and those with mood disorders also have a higher prevalence for SUDs. Periods of
drug abstinence are also associated with increased irritability, heightened anxiety, and
increased mood disorder symptoms. Further, repeated exposure to either drugs of abuse or
stress is associated with mood-related disorders. Thus, the comorbidity between substance
abuse and mood disorders is an ongoing challenge for the field. There is a need for both
improved understanding of mechanisms mediating this comorbidity and a need for novel and
effective therapeutic targets. Research continues to reveal overlapping mechanisms, notably in
brain reward pathways, mediating both SUDs and mood-related disorders. In humans, L-type
calcium channel (LTCC) genes have been identified as candidate risk genes for cocaine
dependence, major depressive disorder, and heightened anxiety. In rodent models, we have
found that activation of L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA)
enhances cocaine-related, depression-like, anxiety-like, and anhedonic behavior, while also
inducing social deficits. We have also found that LTCC blockade leads to decreased drug-
seeking behavior via regulation of dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc).
However, the field still lacks in depth understanding of LTCC mechanisms in neuropsychiatric
disorders. More specifically, there is very limited understanding of LTCC mechanisms mediating
depression and anxiety-related phenotypes induced by exposure to drugs of abuse or chronic
stress – represent a gap in scientific knowledge. Our preliminary findings have revealed that
LTCC blockade in cocaine abstinent or chronic stress exposed rats induces anxiolytic-like and
antidepressant-like effects. In the current proposal, we will integrate intravenous drug self-
administration and chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) paradigms with behavioral pharmacology
and in vivo electrochemistry (voltammetry) in male and female rats to: 1) Determine whether
LTCC blockade produces anxiolytic-like and antidepressant-like effects and promotes social
interaction during cocaine abstinence, via regulation of DA signaling and, 2) Determine whether
LTCC blockade attenuates the anxiogenic and anhedonic effects, and the social interaction
deficits, of CUS. In this proposal, we will identify the underlying mechanisms by which LTCC
blockade may serve as a novel therapeutic intervention to alleviate mood disorder symptoms
associated with repeated exposure to cocaine or stress."

 Sex and gender differences in aging and other health outcomes are frequently severely confounded by
behavioral and environmental factors, mandating the use of animal models. Epigenetic age estimators provide
a powerful tool in determining the epigenetic age alleviating the necessity of monitoring cohorts of animals
throughout their lives in captivity or in the wild. The present study, by using outbred deer mice (Peromyscus)
will explore how genetic relatedness of parents, history of social interactions, and CDK8/19 inhibition impact
epigenetic age. The study relies on preliminary data indicating differences in the rate of epigenetic aging
between males and females upon these interventions. Mechanistically, to link genetic relatedness with aging
we will focus on the induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, that reportedly differs between men and
women. For our studies both monogamous and polygamous Peromyscus will be used. Specifically, we will (a).
test if ER stress in females is more dependent on overall heterozygosity status than in males. Peromyscus
male and female offspring of parents that differ in their genetic relatedness, as well as fibroblasts cultured in
vitro, will be evaluated for ER stress and the resulting UPR, by analyzing the levels of a roster of chaperones
that reflect ER stress. For our analysis we will utilize animals from all different stocks of Peromyscus as well as
F1 hybrids between different stocks and species. (b). we will explore how the biobehavioral environment
impacts epigenetic age estimators. We propose to test how pair bonding, disruption and biparental care,
impact comparatively epigenetic aging in males and females, both the offspring as well as their parents. (c). we
will explore the impact of CDK8/19 inhibition in epigenetic aging. Pharmacological interventions aiming to
alleviate aging, besides providing avenues for the development of anti-aging therapies they also point to
disparities impacting differentially the different sexes. Preliminary findings in mice indicate that inhibition of
cyclin dependent kinases (CDK) 8/19, which regulate signal-induced transcription represents an avenue that
may hold significant anti-aging value, preferentially towards females. Here we propose to explore if CDK8/19
inhibition decreases the epigenetic age, and alleviates telomere attrition and mitochondrial abundance of
outbred deer mice. The proposed study constitutes a first effort to describe sex-based disparities in epigenetic
aging in relation socioenvironmental factors and choices that impact the women’s social environment in the
context of pair bonding and parents’ genetic relatedness. A. pharmacological intervention that prevents agent
preferably in women will also be evaluated."

An impaired epithelial lining is a key pathological element of numerous diseases of the colon; however, our
understanding of how specific epithelial cell populations contribute to colonic health and disease is limited.
Deep crypt secretory (DCS) cells are a poorly-understood epithelial cell lineage residing at the colonic crypt
base. These cells express immuno-modulatory, host defense, and stem cell niche factors that are commonly
dysregulated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and other disorders. Thus, DCS cells represent an
appealing potential therapeutic target for restoring tissue health in colonic inflammatory disease. A better
understanding of the basic biology of DCS cells is essential for future therapies targeting the epithelium. In
recent work we found that immune signaling regulates DCS cell population size, and our preliminary data
suggest that key inflammation-responsive factors drive DCS cells to an “activated” state characterized by
heightened levels of immuno-modulatory and host defense factors. This project is designed to elucidate a
novel paradigm of DCS cell activation in the response to colitis and to determine the role(s) of these cells in
colonic inflammation and recovery. In the proposed work, we will 1) test whether impaired DCS cell responses
exacerbate colonic inflammation and/or limit tissue repair and regeneration, 2) define the function of activated
DCS cells in the colon, and 3) determine the cellular mechanisms that regulate DCS cell population shifts and
activation. This investigation into the functional roles and regulation of DCS cells in colitis could point to new

Cytoskeletal remodeling and turnover are central contributors to left ventricular (LV) remodeling that underlies
cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Formin homology 2 domain containing-3 (FHOD3) is a member of the formin
protein family that regulates cardiac actin filament formation. FHOD3 is required for sarcomere formation during
embryonic heart development and remodeling of the adult heart. We identified a common variant, FHOD3V1151I
(rs2303510), associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). To investigate the mechanistic basis of the
association of FHOD3V1151I with HCM, we used CRISPR to create an Fhod3V1151I mouse model and discovered
that Fhod3V1151I mice have normal heart size and contractile function in the absence of hypertrophic stimulus.
Provocatively, though, Fhod3V1151I mice develop excessive cardiac hypertrophy and physiologic findings of heart
failure, including activation of the fetal gene program with pressure overload. Using our state-of-the-art
Autophagy Detecting Nanoparticle imaging technology we demonstrate that Fhod3V1151I mice have impaired
autophagy. The role of autophagy defects are recognized in cardiomyopathy and are therefore emerging as an
important modifier to the cardiac response to stress that could impact the development of HCM and associated
symptoms. In this proposal, we will compare the response of Fhod3V1151I mice to autophagy stimulation
(rapamycin) and inhibition (bafilomycin). Furthermore, we will test the role of the Fhod3 variant in the context of
a mutation in Mybpc3, which serves as a mouse model of HCM known to have defective autophagy. Because
Fhod3V1151I mice have reduced levels of the early autophagy regulator Beclin, we will assess whether the
recombinant protein tat-Beclin can rescue the autophagy defect caused by Fhod3V1151I in the context of a Mybpc3
mutation that causes HCM. Finally, since extracellular vesicle (EV) formation is a direct consequence of
autophagy and we demonstrate significant defects in EV production with FHOD3V1151I, we will evaluate the effects
of FHOD3 on cellular component trafficking related to autophagy and EV production. Considering that the
FHOD3V1151I allele is carried by approximately one third of humans of all races and ethnicities, and because of
its established association with HCM as a risk allele, the potential impact of this study on human heart failure is
substantial. By defining the mechanisms by which FHOD3 variants modify cardiac autophagy and LV
remodeling, including the role of genotype-defined personalized medicine strategies that may modify this genetic
risk, these studies have the potential to translate into improved heart failure management."
10945128,"PROJECT SUMMARY
An ideal ""universal flu vaccine"" should have the ability to trigger broadly protective antibody and humoral memory
responses against both existing and future influenza viral strains. However, a major obstacle in achieving this
goal is immunodominance in B cell responses, which tend to prioritize dominant epitopes at the expense of
conserved yet subdominant epitopes. In the case of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA), the variable globular head
domain is highly immunodominant over the stem epitope that is much more conserved. To address this challenge,
a Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist-based nanoparticle (NP) adjuvant (TLR7-NP) has been developed to induce
prolonged and localized TLR7 signaling in the draining lymph nodes. In contrast to TLR7 agonist formulated with
alum (TLR7-alum), the TLR7-NP adjuvant has demonstrated a remarkable ability to overcome
immunodominance and stimulate a broad antibody response targeting the subdominant HA stem epitope. There
is a critical need to understand the precise mechanisms controlling B cell immunodominance and the breadth of
humoral responses. The goal of this research is to gain mechanistic insights into how adjuvant formulation
influences B cell intrinsic and extrinsic factors that shape immunodominance and the breadth of humoral
responses. The overarching hypothesis is that the interplay between B cell intrinsic and extrinsic factors,
prompted by prolonged TLR signaling through nanoparticle formulated adjuvant, facilitates the recruitment,
selection and effector differentiation of germinal center (GC) B cells specific for the subdominant epitopes. This
hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine how TLR7-NP impacts
immunodominance, breadth and tolerance across different stages of B cell memory development. The goal of
this aim is to identify the “bottleneck” that has the greatest influence on the immunodominance and breadth of
the humoral response. Aim 2 will elucidate the interplay between extrinsic factors and B cells underlying the
enhancement of antibody breadth by TLR7-NP. In this aim, we will use genetic models to manipulate the
surrounding cell types as well as the microenvironment to investigate how these specific pathways contribute to
the altered B cell immunodominance, a crucial mechanism underlying the breadth induced by TLR7-NP. This
research proposal is innovative because it makes a conceptual advance in understanding the mechanisms
governing the breadth of humoral responses, linking it to the spatiotemporal regulation of signaling through
adjuvant formulation. This research proposal is significant because these insights will not only advance our
understanding of how vaccine adjuvants work but also will empower us to refine vaccine strategies to precisely
manipulate the breadth of B cell response. Ultimately, this will unlock new opportunities for the rational design of
universal influenza vaccines.

10947644,"Project Summary/Abstract
Generation of a functional adaptive immune response relies on the collaboration of the cellular (T cell) and
humoral (B cell) compartments. T follicular helper (Tfh) cells provide essential help to B cells to undergo
isotype class-switch recombination and generate high-affinity antibody through somatic hypermutation.
Follicular regulatory T (Tfr) cells have been implicated in controlling this process as they have been shown to
be critical in regulating germinal center B cell responses and prevent autoantibody formation. However, how
these Tfr cells develop is unknown. B cells undergo a unique type-III interferon dependent and isotype class-
switching process in the thymus, the location of T cell development, and induce clonal deletion and Treg cell
selection. Developing Treg cells that depend on licensed thymic B cell antigens may also interact with
activated B cells in the periphery and take on a Tfr phenotype. Thus, Treg cells selected by thymic B cells may
become Tfr cells in the periphery and help to reduce the risk autoantibody generation.
The objective of this work is to understand what role licensed thymic B cells play in T cell tolerance. In this
proposal we identified T cell receptors that generate Tfr cells when expressed by developing T cells, propose
to study the requirements of these TCRS for selection as well as explore further functional consequences
when thymic B cells are absent. Our central hypothesis is that type-III interferon drives thymic B cell
licensing, resulting in the presentation of B cell activation induced self-peptides, thereby supporting
the development of Treg cells that become Tfr cells and regulate humoral immune responses.
Through this work we hope to generate a mechanistic understanding of the impact of thymic B cell activation
on immune tolerance. These findings will have the potential to reveal new pathways regulating adaptive
immune responses and have implications in our understanding of autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus
erythematous or rheumatoid arthritis, diseases where pathogenic autoreactive antibodies mediate disease. I
am applying for this K99/R00 as an Instructor in Laboratory Medicine and Pathology Department with
subspecialty training in Molecular Pathology. My long-term career goals are to support for the clinical diagnosis
of autoimmunity and inborn errors of immunity and to lead an R01 funded research program that investigates
central tolerance and immunodeficiency."

Gender-based violence (GBV) disproportionately impacts women, particularly sexual and gender minority
(SGM) women, with the consequences of unaddressed victimization representing a key driver of health
disparities among survivor populations. To progress from merely identifying these disparities to actively
intervening, innovative interventions are needed to promote healing engagement, build bridges within survivor
care infrastructure, and connect survivors with appropriate resources to help them heal. The long-term goal is
to establish gender and sexuality-inclusive interventions that promote healing and wellbeing for diverse women
survivors of GBV. The primary objective of this research is to refine and evaluate a photo-elicitation
intervention, Photo-experiencing and Reflective Listening (PEARL), aimed at identifying help-seeking barriers
and promoting healing engagement among GBV survivors. The rationale for this project is that there is a
critical unmet need for inclusive interventions that identify survivor-centered social determinants of trauma
healing while creating a structure for survivors to identify their needs and co-create a healing action for
themselves moving forward. This project has two key aims: 1) to refine the PEARL intervention prototype for
implementation with cisgender heterosexual, sexual minority, and trans women who have experienced GBV,
and 2) to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and potential impact of PEARL in these populations (N=40).
The study will employ a community-engaged, mixed methods approach. Aim 1 will involve collaborating with a
community and scientific advisory board to refine the PEARL prototype and enhance the effectiveness and
applicability of PEARL in diverse survivor populations. Aim 2 will employ a randomized waitlist control design to
assess feasibility, acceptability, and PEARL's potential impact on healing engagement and related health
outcomes. The research is paired with a career development plan that will equip the applicant with the skills
necessary for community-engaged intervention development, health equity-focused design, and
implementation science to transition her into an independent researcher that can improve the survivor care
landscape through her program of research. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it
focuses on recovery rather than deficit in inclusive women survivor populations, using trauma-informed, and
survivor-centered approaches. It also leverages photo-elicitation, allowing survivors to highlight their
multidimensional social world and reflect on how it might facilitate, create barriers, or shape healing needs in
real time. This study's significance lies in its response to the pressing need for inclusive interventions to
explore the social determinants of health that influence GBV survivor healing, all while promoting survivor
engagement in the healing process. By bridging existing gaps in GBV survivor support for women, this
research aligns closely with NINR's mission to promote health equity, identify social/structural determinants,
and promote health and wellbeing in populations exposed to trauma and violence."

Despite advances in medical therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), mortality rates remain high.
Empagliflozin to Improve Right Ventricular Function in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (EmPAH) is a 3-center
blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase II trial testing whether 10 mg empagliflozin taken daily for 24
weeks will improve PAH patient heart function and other outcomes. The trial's primary endpoint is change in
Right Ventricular Ejection Fraction measured by Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging. Secondary
endpoints include: changes in Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE) measured by echocardio-
gram, 6 Minute Walk Distance, quality of life (SF-36 Physical Health Composite and EmPHAsis10), and N-
terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), each measured at baseline, weeks 12, week 24; a “time
to clinical worsening” composite, defined multicomponent improvement, and proportion of patients meeting
the three criteria of the French Risk Score. Seven additional exploratory endpoints have been specified,
and the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) will also carry out exploratory analyses of clinical and cardiac
imaging phenotypes associated with response to empagliflozin therapy. The DCC will oversee study
design and carry out all statistical analyses and contribute to EmPAH publications and dissemination. The
DCC will play a leadership role in the development of the trial protocol, manual of operations, and case
report forms, and will monitor recruitment, retention, adherence, and especially safety, as well as track and
implement procedures to improve the quality of data, samples, and images. The DCC will prepare DSMB
reports and manage virtual DSMB meetings and as well as the annual DSMB meetings in Bethesda. DCC
statistical, database, and administrative personnel will ensure the trial fully exemplifies regulatory compliance
and best practices for data collection and database management. The Biorepository - a section of the DCC -
will train sites in biological sample collection, local storage, and monthly shipment to the Biorepository which
will analyze triglycerides, LDL, HDL, total cholesterol and NT-proBNP and will archive samples for sharing.
Echocardiograms and CMR images will be read centrally at the Imaging Center – a section of the CCC – who
will train sites to collect appropriately-formatted images following EmPAH procedures, securely transfer images
to the CMR and Echo Core labs and will transmit results to the DCC. The DCC will develop and maintain the
trial's distributed data entry and database management systems. Triple blinding of randomized treatment
(empagliflozin vs. placebo) will reduce the potential for bias due to knowledge of treatment, even at the
subconscious level, among participants, investigators, health care providers, outcome measurers, and
biostatisticians. EmPAH's Phase II trial sample size of 78 has 85% power to show a difference of 11
percentage points between empagliflozin and placebo and will provide data on safety and logistic issues
related to carrying out a Phase III trial of empagliflozin in PAH."

 The clinical landscape of metastatic melanoma has been revolutionized by immune checkpoint blockade
(ICB); however, despite these advancements, the effectiveness of ICB for metastatic melanoma is limited to
approximately half of patients1. The development of acquired resistance, in part through the loss of MHC-I
antigen presentation, leaves most patients to experience disease progression2–5. Recent advancements have
highlighted the use of adoptive cell therapy (ACT) for treatment of ICB resistant melanoma (e.g., CAR T cells)6–
8. However, the solid tumor microenvironment (TME) presents a critical barrier for success of T cell-based
therapies largely due to the direct competition between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and cancer cells for
metabolic resources, rendering T cells dysfunctional and exhausted9,10. There is an urgent clinical need for the
development of new strategies to engineer adoptive T cells with the ability to sustain function in the harsh solid
TME, particularly if these approaches can be combined with other therapies (e.g., small molecule targeted
therapy) to improve clinical outcomes.
 Our group and others have recently reported that TME-induced environmental stress leads to epigenome
remodeling events within TILs, including loss of the histone methyltransferase EZH211. EZH2, a key component
of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), induces the repression of gene transcription via methylation of
lysine 27 of Histone H3 (H3K27me3)12. Loss of EZH2, and thereby H3K27me3, in activated T cells leads to
transcriptional reprogramming that results in an exhausted T cell phenotype. Our Preliminary Data suggests that
protecting EZH2 activity in activated T cells circumvents this exhaustion and produces a T cell with durable
activity in the harsh TME. Preliminary Data presented herein, and evidence previously reported by independent
groups, support the premise of our proposal that protection of T cell EZH2 expression and/or activity will create
a more durable and potent ACT. In this innovative proposal, we will rigorously test the hypothesis that preserving
EZH2 function in T cells will enable adoptive T cells to persist and function in the melanoma tumor environment.
To test our hypothesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: (1) Demonstrate enhanced EZH2 activity can
protect T cell function in the solid tumor microenvironment, and (2) Engineer EZH2i resistant CAR T cells for
combinatorial treatment of metastatic melanoma."

The World Health Organization recommends postpartum family planning (PPFP) for birth spacing and
prevention of maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, unmet need for PPFP remains
extremely high across developing countries, including Zambia. PPFP services have not been routinely
implemented in Zambia due to lack of stakeholder involvement, limited provider training, lack of demand-
creation strategies informed by client needs and preferences, and lack of optimized operational procedures.
Additionally, the role of male involvement in PPFP uptake is critical and widely overlooked. To address these
issues, we will undertake the necessary formative work to develop and pilot test an innovative, evidence-based
intervention to improve PPFP services in Zambia. We will first conduct in-depth interviews with
key stakeholders and focus groups with government facility nurses to evaluate structural- and contextual-level
factors that influence the achievement of healthy birth intervals (Aim 1). We will also assess facility
organizational readiness to implement PPFP services via direct observation of practices and operational
workflows. We will then conduct focus groups with pregnant women and couples to evaluate individual- and
couple-level factors that influence the achievement of healthy birth intervals (Aim 2). Finally, based on
stakeholder, provider, and couple/client preferences and needs, we will develop and pilot test PPFP training
and promotional tools, workflows, and identify and engage PPFP champions (Aim 3). This is the first study to
rigorously develop PPFP demand creation and service implementation strategies in Zambia. With the renewed
interest in PPFP services from the Zambian Ministry of Health, this proposal is extremely well-timed and has
the potential to make a significant impact on PPFP services to improve birth spacing, reduce abortion, and
reduce maternal-child morbidity and mortality. Moreover, our PPFP intervention is a potentially replicable and
sustainable model that could be expanded to other sub-Saharan African countries."
10947911,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare childhood onset neuromuscular disease caused by genetic deficiency of the protein dystrophin. DMD is an incurable disease with a devastating impact on patients as a result of progressive weakness, wheelchair confinement, loss of independence/activities of daily living, and ultimately premature death from combined cardiorespiratory insufficiency. The majority of dystrophin gene mutations worldwide are multi-exon, frameshifting deletions that eliminate expression of variable portions of the 79 exon gene into the 427 Kd full length protein isoform Dp427. Dp427 is a cytoskeletal protein primarily composed of three protein folding domains, the largest of which is the rodlike mid-section composed of 24 spectrin-like triple helical repeats. Dp427 is thought to transmit muscle contractile force between the outermost sacomeres and the membrane-spanning proteins of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC). Recently, an ultra-rare subset of DMD patients has been found to develop T cell-mediated, treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) following systemic gene therapy using AAV vectors encoding miniaturized, ~ 140 Kd recombinant proteins derived from Dp427 by internal deletion. Our preclinical studies, as published in 2019 by Song, et al, Nature Medicine, predicted these TESAEs by virtue of our use of an informative animal model, the German Shorthaired Pointer Muscular Dystrophy (GSHPMD) in which a naturally occurring deletions eliminates peptide epitopes corresponding to the miniaturized versions of Dp427. In this study we also showed that a non- immunogenic alternative AAV vector encoding a miniaturized version of the dystrophin-related protein utrophin was protected from T cell destruction of transduced myofibers by central immunological tolerance towards this “self” protein. In this U01 proposal, we provide a milestone-driven, comprehensive translational and clinical research program to set the stage for a safe and effective alternative for the ultra-rare subset of DMD patients excluded from dystrophin gene therapy trials. We propose innovative, non-invasive physiological and biochemical outcome measures precisely targeted to the underlying pathophysiology of the disease, segmental myonecrosis incited by forceful muscle contraction. The four Specific Aims are structured to yield the highest probability of a successful IND application as the final deliverable, while providing ample information generalizable to therapeutics development for other genetic diseases under the NINDS mission. The proposed IND application will set the stage for a phase 1/2a clinical trial of AAV-microutrophin gene therapy in the ultra- rare subset of DMD patients with N-terminal dystrophin deletions, with results of the trial anticipated to apply broadly to the entire DMD patient population."
10948282,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Empirical neuroethics studies of patient/user perspectives have demonstrated profound effects that
novel neurotechnological therapies, such as implanted devices, can have on people’s understandings
of themselves and their illnesses. However, to date the incorporation of such perspectives in the design
of neurotechnologies is not a standard practice, and this gap presents risk for ethical harms and may
negatively impact the usability and feasibility of interventions based on BRAIN Initiative-supported
research. The long-term goal of this proposal is to facilitate the BRAIN Initiative’s success in discovering
effective and ethically sound therapies for disorders of the nervous system. The central hypothesis is
that human-centered design, an interdisciplinary approach that prioritizes user perspectives and has
been successfully applied to implementation problems in fields such as digital technology and health
systems design, can be applied to related problems in neurotechnology. The work will be conducted by
pursuing three specific aims: 1) Examine adverse user experiences with non-human-centered design,
highlighting pitfalls and needs for improvement; 2) Assess prevailing attitudes regarding human-
centered design and barriers to adoption among neurotechnology developers; and 3) Convene
neurotechnologists to identify needs and to develop strategies for integrating user perspectives in
neurotechnology. Under the first aim, in-depth qualitative interviews will be conducted with blind people
implanted with the Argus II retinal implant, a commercially non-viable technology no longer supported
by its manufacturer, which may illustrate how failures to incorporate user perspectives in design can
lead to ethical harm and to technology abandonment. For the second aim, professionals engaged in
neurotechnology (including neuroscientists, engineers, businesspeople, and officials/regulators) will be
interviewed about incorporating user perspectives generally and about human-centered design
specifically. These interviews will offer insight into the lack of adoption of human-centered design in
neurotechnology to date. In the third aim, two convenings of neurotechnologists will be organized to co-
create plans for making the incorporation of user perspectives a standard practice in neurotechnology.
The approach is innovative, shifting research paradigms in neuroethics and neurotechnology through
new conceptual and methodological linkages with human-centered design. The proposed research is
significant, because the ethical and effective provision of novel treatments depends on incorporating
the priorities of patients and prospective users more directly in their design. Ultimately, we envision a
mutually reinforcing relationship between neuroethics and human-centered design, two interdisciplinary
fields that can bring needed new outlooks and methods to the practice of neuroscience."
10947727,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Making correct choices, and learning from them, requires a detailed understanding of biological needs. Such
needs are governed by fluctuating drives (hunger, thirst) and by larger, underlying rhythms such as the Circadian
Cycle. Forebrain circuits, and axonal inputs to them from the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA), are crucial to
computations underlying choice and learning. A key source of body state information for the Forebrain are
circulating signals in the vasculature. However, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is commonly reported to block
almost all such signaling molecules to protect the brain from contamination. Our lab has been testing a potential
resolution to this tension: Specifically, we have found that BBB permeability is dynamic, only ‘opening’ at
behaviorally-relevant moments when the risk of contamination is worth the reward of higher quality state
information. Our extensive Preliminary Data show that BBB permeability events occur in response to local VTA
axon activity both endogenous and optogenetically-driven.
I build on these new findings and my graduate studies, where I discovered substantial vascular dynamics
between sleep and waking (Turner et al., 2020)1 and how these relate to indicators of arousal (Turner et al.,
2023)2. In Aim I, I will test the hypothesis that VTA axon activity and local dopaminergic (DA) levels peak
early in the active (dark) phase, and then decrease progressively. I will test this hypothesis with 1P and 2P
imaging of VTA axon activity and DA signaling in Neocortex and Striatum, leveraging behavioral paradigms
shown to drive distinct patterns of VTA axon activity (Hamid et al., 2021)3. In Aim II, I will test the hypothesis
that VTA-driven BBB permeability events show the same relationship to Circadian Cycle. Specifically, that
single axon spikes and optogenetic input drive larger amplitude permeability events early in the active (dark)
phase followed by a decreased relative impact across this phase. In these studies, I will test endogenous and
optogenetic-driven VTA axon activation while imaging local BBB permeability events and systematically testing
that VTA-driven BBB permeability events allow the transmission of multiple active signaling molecules including
sex hormones and metabolic cues. In Aim III, I will test the hypothesis that integration of prior reward
history will have the strongest impact early in the active (dark) phase. In these studies, I will employ a two-
armed bandit task in conjunction with fiber photometry recordings of DA levels in SI, mFC, DS, and NAc. I will fit
this data into behavioral computation frameworks developed in my co-sponsor Dr. Michael Frank’s laboratory.
These studies will generate unique data that tests how a major determinant of behavioral state, the Circadian
Cycle, relates to VTA axon activity, rapid changes in BBB permeability, and behavior itself. Further, these
studies are ideal for my training, directly supporting my central career goal of understanding how
dynamic neural-vascular interactions reflect and contribute to behavior."

THIRD COAST CFAR: OVERALL
The broad, long-term mission of the Third Coast Center for AIDS Research (TC CFAR) is to use our
trans-disciplinary collaborations to power transformational advances across the translational spectrum
from discovery to implementation of effective interventions - and end HIV. Many local resources at
Northwestern University (UC), the University of Chicago (UC), and community partners have been, and
will continue to be, brought to bear on this mission. The allowable Funded Research Base (FRB)
increased by 47%, and projects became more trans-disciplinary, from FY14 to FY18. Nimble and
opportunistic strategic planning (by the Administrative Core, AC) and robust growth in seed funding
and mentoring programs (by the Developmental Core, DC) led to those successes, and to choosing
specific, high-priority HIV research topics as foci for a second term. Institutional support has increased.
The Overall scientific aims were also chosen based on each of the 3 scientific Cores having a user
base and expert resources with strengths on each aim. Each of these Cores has also worked to extend
their resources and expertise to researchers outside their own domains, and thereby helped build
collaborations. The following Overall aims build on our solid foundation, and will direct each scientific
Core, in concert with the AC and the DC, to synergistically advance the science needed to end HIV.
Overall Aim 1: To continue and expand collaborative research that will slow, and eventually stop, the
HIV epidemic by improving continuums of HIV prevention and care.
Overall Aim 2: To advance understanding of accelerated aging-related illnesses (non-AIDS
comorbidities) that occur despite suppression of HIV viremia.
Overall Aim 3: To speed discovery and empower development of transformative scientific innovations
that will improve HIV prevention and treatment for persons living with HIV."
10949348,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Stroke prevalence is predicted to reach 10 million by 2030, with the largest increase in Hispanic and Black
populations. About half of patients who survive a stroke are at increased risk of stroke recurrence within three
months, making this a critical period for preventative intervention. While hypertension is the most important
modifiable risk factor for stroke, blood pressure (BP) remains poorly controlled among many largely due to low
medication adherence and particularly among ethno-racial minorities. Additionally, physical activity (PA), which
is linked to lower BP, is low among patients following a stroke. There is evidence that behavioral and medical
interventions could reduce recurrent events by 80%, but such interventions are lacking, and real-world
application is limited. The goal of this proposal is to develop and test a scalable, patient-centered, telehealth-
delivered behavioral intervention that promotes self-regulation for multiple health behaviors, i.e., BP medication
adherence and PA.
 I hypothesize that a theory-based behavioral intervention that increases allocated attention for enhanced
self-regulation can improve multiple preventive health behaviors. Using translational research models and an
optimization trial design, I will investigate the feasibility of an intervention that utilizes infographic-guided
motivational interviewing (MI) and self-monitoring with behavioral and environmental feedback during the first
three months following a stroke. In Aim 1, I will identify educational content in an MI intervention for BP control
and PA in post-stroke patients and culturally adapt it with input from local diverse stroke patients and their
professionally diverse providers. To support the adapted MI, infographics will be generated in English and
Spanish with patient's own data for automated delivery. In Aim 2, I will conduct a MOST (Multiphase Optimization
Strategy)-inspired pilot feasibility trial to identify feasible components for BP control, PA, or both. Finally, as an
Exploratory Aim, I will conduct a preliminary assessment of intervention efficacy and target health behavior
change mechanisms. A detailed understanding of how each component performs and impacts health behavior
will lead to more targeted patient-centered interventions while addressing inequities for improved health
outcomes. This work will also allow me to develop valuable expertise in behavioral interventions.
 I have a clinical background in neurology with an emphasis on stroke and cerebrovascular diseases and
have a Master's degree in Patient Oriented Research. I am committed to a career in stroke prevention research
and plan to use the training obtained through this NIH Career Development Award to support my future work in
this field. With the long-term goal of independence as a physician-investigator with expertise in behavioral
interventions for stroke prevention, I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team and set short-term goals
in biomedical informatics, behavioral intervention trial methods, and human centered design in health disparities
research."

 This application proposes a five-year research career development program focused on innate lymphoid
cells in the pathogenesis and individualized management of inflammatory bowel disease. The applicant, Siyan
Cao, M.D., Ph.D., is an Instructor of Medicine at the Division of Gastroenterology at Washington University
School of Medicine. Since completing gastroenterology fellowship, Dr. Cao has been working in the laboratory
of Dr. Marco Colonna, where he discovered a novel role of endoplasmic reticulum stress in innate lymphoid cells.
This proposal is an extension of the candidate’s previous work demonstrating IRE1α-XBP1-medicated stress
pathway controls the activation of innate lymphoid cells in murine colitis and patients with inflammatory bowel
disease. The proposed experiments will incorporate innate and mucosal immunology expertise from the
candidate’s mentor, Dr. Marco Colonna, immune cell-epithelial cell interaction and microbiome experience from
the candidate’s co-mentor, Dr. Rodney Newberry, RNA modification and degradation expertise from the
candidate’s co-mentor, Dr. Nicholas Davidson, as well as expertise on intestinal organoids, tissue fibrosis, and
translational/clinical studies from the candidate’s Research Advisory Committee members, Drs. Matthew Ciorba,
Andreas Herrlich, and Parakkal Deepak. Together, the candidate will be uniquely positioned to acquire the
knowledge and skill sets necessary to develop an independent research program investigating how cellular
stress response orchestrates innate immunity in gut inflammation and open avenues for novel management in
inflammatory bowel disease.
 Innate lymphoid cells reside on the mucosal surface and control tissue homeostasis. IRE1α-XBP1 is the
regulatory hub of endoplasmic reticulum stress and implicated in inflammatory bowel disease in genome-wide
association studies. IRE1α is highly expressed in innate lymphoid cells, although its role in those cells remains
unknown. My studies have established that IRE1α-XBP1 controls the activation of innate lymphoid cells in both
mouse colitis models and human inflammatory bowel disease. Using a comprehensive approach involving
lymphocyte-organoid co-culture, genetic mouse models, and longitudinal patient cohorts, this proposal intends
to elucidate the mechanistic role of IRE1α-XBP1 in innate lymphoid cells in intestinal inflammation, and how
those pathways may become novel response biomarkers in inflammatory bowel disease. Ultimately, with the
mentorship provided by Drs. Colonna, Newberry, Davidson, and the other Research Advisory Committee
members, the knowledge and technical skills derived from the proposed experiments, and completion of the
outlined career development plan, Dr. Cao will be well-prepared to establish an independent research program
and is expected to be highly competitive for R01 funding."
10949689,"Abstract. Non-alcoholic beverages that seek to mimic alcohol (e.g., non-alcoholic beers, non-alcoholic wines,
non-alcoholic liquor, and “mocktails”) are rapidly expanding in popularity and availability, with a 15-30% annual
increase in U.S. sales since 2018. Non-alcoholic beverages are most commonly consumed by people who also
consume alcohol and consumers often report using these drinks to try to reduce their alcohol use. Research on
the relation between non-alcoholic beverage use and alcohol use is needed to inform consumers, clinical
providers, and public health professionals about whether non-alcoholic beverages help people to reduce alcohol
use (by serving as a substitute) or paradoxically stimulate it (through cue-induced craving). Through the
proposed K99/R00 Award, Dr. Bowdring will examine the potential utility vs. harm of non-alcoholic beverages.
Ecological momentary assessments (EMA; measures captured in real-time with prompts sent via smartphone)
will be used to sensitively test associations between non-alcoholic beverage use and alcohol use among people
with alcohol use disorders (AUD) and social drinkers. Aim 1 (K99): Estimate the relation between non-alcoholic
beverage use and alcohol use among people with AUD. Participants will be n=102 U.S. adults (ages 21-89) who
meet criteria for AUD and regularly consume non-alcoholic beverages. They will complete survey assessments
of non-alcoholic beverage use and alcohol cravings, as well as alcohol use measured via portable breathalyzers,
multiple times per day across multiple weeks. This study will inform methodological decisions for the R00 study.
Aim 2 (R00): Estimate differences in the relation between non-alcoholic beverage use and alcohol use between
people with AUD and social drinkers. With a larger sample size to support power in testing differences between
two distinct subgroups, the R00 EMA study (n=220) will replicate and build on the K99 study by also recruiting
social drinkers in addition to people with AUD. Exploratory Aim 3 (K99+R00): Model the relation between alcohol
craving, non-alcoholic beverage use, and alcohol use. In both the K99 and R00 study, the role of alcohol craving
in the relation between non-alcoholic beverage use and alcohol use will be explored, offering novel insight into

10944202,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Gene therapy is a promising therapeutic strategy to treat human diseases. While vectors can be
engineered to target specific cells, the blood flow greatly favors liver and lung exposure. Delivery of vectors to
confined anatomic compartments such as the eye and central nervous system, or ex vivo to cells that are
modified than re-administered, are strategies successful in approved gene therapies. Many other organs
cannot be effectively targeted using current vector systems. Gene therapy for heart disease has failed in
clinical trials due in large part to low transduction of cardiomyocytes reported as 1% of cells. Coronary blood
flow is very robust and intracoronary vector has little time to access cardiac cells. In the blood stream, vector
is vulnerable to detection by pre-existing anti-AAV neutralizing antibodies that are present in up to 90% of the
population. These obstacles, along with the high cost of producing vector limits the efficacy and translatability
of cardiac gene therapy. The fundamental problem of therapeutic gene delivery is the focus of this proposal.
 Our interdisciplinary multi-PI team will approach gene therapy from a novel bioengineering approach,
developing hydrogels to traverse biological barriers to vector delivery. We will engineer a hydrolysis-cleavable
poly(-ethylene glycol, PEG) hydrogel to deliver gene therapy vectors to the epicardium. Our preliminary data
support the idea that this mode of delivery will optimize cardiac transduction. We have previously
demonstrated the efficacy of PEG hydrogels and validated a hydrogel delivery device that is able to deliver
hydrogels in a minimally invasive and fast procedure using standard fluoroscopy. Our multi-PI team includes
Rebecca Levit, a physician scientist with extensive expertise cardiac therapeutics and small animal models,
Andrés García, an engineer and expert on biocompatible hydrogels, and Christopher Doering, a gene therapist
with a track record of development, translation, and manufacturing of gene therapies.
 This project is organized to efficiently and rapidly assess this novel mode of delivery of gene therapy. In
aim 1 we will test 6 hydrogel prototypes in vitro and in vivo to determine the most efficient formulation for vector
delivery. In aim 2 we will quantify the immunologic advantages of epicardial hydrogel vector delivery to predict
the performance of this strategy in patients. In aim 3 we will deliver a unique candidate gene for cardiac
regeneration as proof of principle of our epicardial hydrogel delivery strategy. We hypothesize that epicardial
hydrogel gene therapy can overcome fundamental circulatory and immunologic barriers to therapeutic gene
delivery. These studies will result in a clear translational path for gene therapy."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is projected to become the second leading cause of
cancer-related deaths in the United States by the year 2030 unless significant progress is made
on improving therapy for this disease. The current 5-year survival rate is ~12%, showing a
modest increase over the last 30 years. Although chemotherapy response rates are improving,
these systemic therapies only provide minimal survival advantage. In addition, PDA is largely
resistant to immunotherapy. Metastasis, a common event in PDA patients, limits the utility of
surgical resection, the most effective therapeutic strategy for PDA. Understanding factors that
contribute PDA progression and metastasis has the potential to reveal novel therapeutic targets.
Recently, we have shown that an embryonic neurotrophic factor, Pleiotrophin (PTN), marks
successful lung metastases in mouse pre-clinical breast cancer models. Consequently, blocking
PTN, pharmacologically or genetically, reduces metastasis and sensitizes metastatic breast
cancer to checkpoint blockade and chemotherapy. The current proposal seeks to determine
whether PTN inhibition is therapeutically efficacious in preclinical models of PDA. PTN is
expressed in PDA and is associated with disease progression. However, there have only been
limited efforts to perturb PTN function in models of PDA. We have the tools to address the
therapeutic utility of targeting PTN in robust models of PDA. This proposal is directly responsive
to PAR-22-2216 which calls for applications focused on novel strategies to enhance the
effectiveness of chemotherapy and or immune therapy. Success in completing the aims of the
project will nominate PTN as a new potential target for the treatment of PDA."

Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are a group of inflammatory disorders characterized by muscle
weakness and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Inflammation and muscle injury are the
central histology features observed in IIM muscle. Both adaptive and innate immune responses are involved in
the pathogenesis of IIM but the pathogenic mechanisms are not yet well defined. Current treatment options for
myositis are limited and focus largely on the use of broad-spectrum immunosuppressive drugs that often lead to
significant complications. Previous studies with synaptotagmin VII null (SytVII-/-) mice displayed impaired
membrane repair capacity and developed mild myositis at two months of age, suggesting that antigen
presentation of internal skeletal muscle proteins may play a role in initiating or exacerbating myositis. We
generated a more robust model of inflammatory myositis by combining the SytVII-/- model with scurfy mice that
have a regulatory T cell deficiency (FoxP3-/Y/SytVII-/-). Adoptive transfer of lymph node cells from FoxP3-/Y/SytVII-
/- mice into Rag-1-/- mice lacking both T- and B-cells results in significant muscle inflammation. This finding also
links the progression of myositis with defects in plasma membrane repair. The plasma membrane repair
response is a conserved cellular response necessary to restore membrane integrity in myocytes and other cells
as part of normal cellular physiology. Defects in membrane repair are linked to a variety of muscle diseases. Our
previous work helped identify specific intracellular proteins as critical components of the membrane repair
process. This application builds on our recently published work and new preliminary studies that identified novel
autoantibodies in myositis patients against multiple proteins that are essential for the membrane repair. We also
established that these autoantibodies can alter the membrane repair capacity of skeletal muscle. We hypothesize
that compromised membrane repair leads to exposure of these membrane repair proteins to the extracellular
space and that the autoantibodies produced against these proteins further compromise membrane repair and
exacerbate the inflammatory response in myositis. Recent results support this hypothesis as increasing the
levels of the antibodies in a myositis mouse model does elevate the pathologic hallmarks of myositis. We will
test this hypothesis with three specific aims. Aim 1 will define the mechanistic role of autoantibodies against
membrane repair proteins in myositis. Aim 2 will determine if patient autoantibodies directed against membrane
repair proteins are sufficient to induce myositis. Aim 3 will test the efficacy of increasing membrane integrity of
skeletal muscle as a novel therapeutic strategy to treat myositis. Our findings that compromised membrane repair
contributes to the development and/or progression of myositis suggests a potential therapeutic approach for IIM."

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has transformed the treatment of hematologic malignancies,
resulting in remarkable disease response rates. Yet, the unprecedented efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy is limited
by unique toxicities. Among them, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), a specific
type of neurotoxicity, found in up to 70% of patients treated with CAR-T cells, consists of neurologic symptoms
including encephalopathy, aphasia, seizures, which often develop acutely. While most cases of ICANS appear
to resolve within the first month post-CAR-T therapy, a subset of patients develop delayed or chronic neurologic
symptoms. However, the acute and chronic neurologic sequelae of CAR-T therapy are poorly understood,
making this an urgent and unmet clinical need. Our preliminary data suggest that the KYN pathway is a critical
link between systemic inflammation and acute ICANS. Also, changes in blood markers of neuroaxonal and glial
injury have been reported during ICANS, suggesting that these are relevant markers. Our ongoing pilot study
assessing neurocognitive and quantitative neuroimaging outcomes in lymphoma patients treated with CAR-T
cell therapy suggest a decline in verbal memory as well as decreases in white matter and resting state functional
connectivity from pre- to 3-4 months post-CAR-T. Taken together, these findings suggest that a deeper
understanding of ICANS and its chronic impact is of utmost relevance given the growing use of CAR-T therapy.
Aim 1 will investigate the molecular pathogenesis of acute ICANS using our large biobank of longitudinally
collected samples from 135 lymphoma patients treated with CAR-T cells. We will assess changes in the KYN
pathway neuroactive metabolites, immune cell transcriptomes, proinflammatory proteins, and markers of
neuronal and glial damage, pre- and within the first month post-CAR-T, to explore their association with the
development of acute ICANS.
Aim 2 will assess neurocognitive function and structural and functional
neuroimaging prospectively in
120 additional lymphoma patients, pre-treatment, as well as 3- and 6-months
post-CAR-T, and their association with acute ICANS. We will explore acute and longitudinal changes in
metabolites, proinflammatory cytokines, and neuronal/glial damage markers, and their association with
neurocognitive and neuroimaging outcomes. This project involves a multi-disciplinary team with complementary
expertise in neurology, immunology, neuropsychology, neuroradiology, neuroimaging, bioinformatics, and
biostatistics with extensive experience in cancer research. We are uniquely positioned to conduct this ambitious
research plan, and our results will offer novel insights into the pathogenesis of acute neurotoxicity and provide
phenotypic characterization of chronic neurologic sequelae after CAR-T cell therapy. By improving the current
scientific understanding and clinical management of ICANS, our study will contribute to identifying patients
at risk for chronic neurotoxicity, improving clinical decision-making, and developing interventions to
prevent/minimize treatment-related sequelae without decreasing CAR-T therapy efficacy."
10945229,"Obesity, the accumulation of excess white adipose tissue (WAT), has become an epidemic and is
associated with chronic metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes. While WAT serves primarily as an energy
storage organ, brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy by generating heat mainly via UCP1 for
maintenance of body temperature. Increasing BAT activity by activating UCP1 may promote energy
expenditure to combat obesity. We have been studying transcriptional activation of UCP1 and thermogenic
gene program and previously found two transcription factors, Zfp516 and Zc3h10 and recruitment of their
coregulators PRDM16/LSD1 and Dot1L, respectively, critical for activation of UCP1 and thermogenic program.
In continuing our efforts to understand UCP1 transcription, our recent ATAC-seq and 3C-based crosslinking
identified a potential new enhancer far upstream of UCP1 locus. We will study this region to act as an
enhancer by examining histone modification, UCP1 promoter activation, and eRNA production, as well as in
the genomic context by CRISPRa and CRISPRi. Moreover, we will examine the involvement of an associated
transcription factor for its enhancer function. Finally, we will assess the impact of this enhancer and the
transcription factor on thermogenesis, adiposity, and glucose/insulin homeostasis in vivo in mice. Overall,
elucidating the role of a previously uncharacterized far upstream UCP1 enhancer and the associated factor will
help us to fully understand UCP1 transcription and thus thermogenesis. Our studies may provide new
obesity/diabetes therapeutics in the future.

10946424,"Project Summary/Abstract
Heart transplantation is recognized as the gold standard therapy for end-stage heart failure. However, demand
for donor hearts currently far outstrips supply due to multiple factors. An important limitation is primary graft
dysfunction (PDG) in 10-20% of transplants and is an important contributor to adverse clinical outcomes and
increased resource utilization. PGD occurs when donor heart function is inadequate for end organ perfusion
and the risk increases once cold preservation time is >4 hours. Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) signaling has a
key role in many cardiovascular diseases including heart failure, and cardiac hypertrophy. It mediates harmful
processes such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis. Using murine models with MR deletions in
cardiomyocytes as well as clinically utilized mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (e.g. canrenone), we show
that MR antagonism can greatly improve donor heart function following preservation. We also demonstrate that
cardiac preservation is associated with increased MR protein expression coupled with organization of MR into
molecular condensates with organizational structures that are known to augment protein transcription and
translation. Importantly we find this occurs both in murine models as well as human hearts suggesting
conserved events during evolution. We also confirm that MR contains intrinsic disordered regions which
mediate phase separation and condensate formation. Our plan is to: (1) Identify the MR domains that can
mediate condensate formation at differing temperatures. We will also determine if MR ligands, MR response
elements and histone deacetylases (HDAC) can facilitate MR condensate formation. This will be performed by
in-vitro evaluation of condensate formation by cloning truncated MR constructs missing specific domains and
then adding different mediators of interest (e.g. HDAC) in the presence of a crowding agent. (2) We will
examine the effects of MR condensate formation by first deleting MR in cardiomyocytes and then use adeno-
associated virus to reconstitute cardiomyocytes with a MR mutant that has an impaired ability to form
condensates because it is missing the intrinsic disordered region. We will then compare the inflammatory,
oxidative stress and cell death responses associated with full length MR and the MR mutant. This will be
evaluated in-vivo in a transplant model which incorporates recipient responses, ex-vivo in a perfusion model
consisting only of the native cardiac cells and in an in-vitro neonatal cardiomyocyte preservation-reperfusion
culture model. (3) We will determine the efficacy of canrenone (a MR antagonist) with or without valproic acid
(a HDAC inhibitor) for improving donor heart function in pigs and humans. Single-cell RNA sequencing will be
performed in human hearts to determine the cell population in which MR signaling is important for preservation.
Our findings will contribute towards decreasing PGD occurrence, increasing donor heart utilization, and
improving transplant outcomes. This is expected to have broad clinical implications such as transplantation of
other solid organs (e.g. liver, kidneys) and for warm cardiac ischemia settings (e.g. myocardial infarction)."
10944444,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Approximately 85% of the proteome is considered undruggable by traditional, occupancy-driven pharmacology
employing small molecular inhibitors. Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and associated molecules that
induce targeted protein degradation via the ubiquitin–proteasome system have emerged as a revolutionary
strategy for addressing “undruggable” targets. However, despite the groundbreaking advances and entry of some
PROTACs into clinical trials, substantial challenges and considerable room for further development remain.
Limitations of current PROTACs include poor cell permeability, limited availability of E3 ligands, and poor
selectivity, highlighting a critical need for ongoing innovations in Targeted Protein Degradation (TPD) technology.
To address these issues, the possibility of developing an efficacious drug delivery system, coupled with
conditional activation of target protein degradation, stands out as a pivotal enhancement. In this context, nucleic
acid-based modalities offer considerable promise for advancing TPD, building on the successful biomedical
applications of nucleic acid-based drugs like antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). The programmable and
addressable nature of DNA or RNA nanostructures has been successfully harnessed, allowing for functional
integration with small molecules, proteins, and peptides to realize applications in drug delivery, vaccines, and
biosensors, among others. Based on these prior successes, we hypothesize that by leveraging the inherent
programmability and addressability of DNA, precise and effective delivery of protein degradation modalities into
cells and conditional activation of degradation can be achieved. For proof-of-concept validation, we have
established an efficient cytoplasmic delivery platform utilizing a multifunctional DNA nanodevice and developed
a DNA-based target protein degradation system (DTAC) capable of degrading CDK4/6 proteins at nanomolar
concentrations. Building on these accomplishments, we intend to integrate our delivery platform with the DNA-
based protein degradation system, aiming to pioneer the next generation of TPD technologies. Our approach
aims to 1) optimize the programmability of our DNA duplex-based protein degradation system by transitioning
from DNA duplex structures to multitargeting DNA nanostructures; 2) assess protein degradation variations
caused by spatial distances and evaluate the efficiency of multi-target degradation; 3) integrate and optimize the
cytoplasmic DNA nanostructure delivery system with the DNA-based protein degradation system; and 4) validate
and optimize the conditional activation of protein degradation through two distinct design approaches: i) toehold
mediated conditional activity of DTAC and ii) allosteric mediated conditional activity of DTAC."

Toxic oligomers formed by amyloid-beta (Aβ) self-association are of high interest for research
into the causes and treatment of Alzheimer's Disease. Studies Aβ oligomer formation on a
molecular level using biophysical and analytical techniques have provided many valuable
insights, but there remain many open questions regarding oligomer structure and the factors
that influence their formation. In the present proposal, we will develop a new method for
studying Aβ oligomerization that greatly diverges from the biochemical and biophysical
approaches historically utilized by the field. Here, we will use a genetically encoded sensor that
detects Aβ oligomer formation and converts the oligomer formation event to the expression of a
reporter gene, enabling high-throughput and direct measurements of Aβ oligomerization. This
format enables us to measure the effects of millions of different factors on Aβ oligomerization
and to quickly identify agents that can selectively bind oligomers over other Aβ species.

10948409,"Title: Metabolic response to contraction in a 3D engineered muscle tissue model of aging
Decreased skeletal muscle mass, specific force, increased overall fatty infiltration in the skeletal muscle, frailty
and depressed energy maintenance are all associated with increased oxidative stress decline in mitochondrial
function and the development of sarcopenia with age. Mitochondrial response to exercise has been shown to be
partially mediated through signaling control following muscle contraction. We have previously developed
protocols to test mitochondrial function following high-intensity interval (HII) and low-intensity steady state (LISS)
muscle contraction in vivo. Following HII, young skeletal muscle mitochondria increased fatty acid oxidation
compared to non-stimulated control muscle; however, aged muscle mitochondria decreased fatty acid oxidation.
In contrast, following LISS, young skeletal muscle decreased fatty acid oxidation, whereas aged muscle
increased fatty acid oxidation. We also found that HII inhibits oxidation of glutamate in both stimulated and non-
stimulated aged muscle, suggesting HII stimulates circulation of a factor capable of altering metabolism
systemically. While longitudinal studies of skeletal muscle function in humans provide invaluable information on
the complex biology of aging and the impact on metabolism, muscle force, and fatiguability, they are often limiting
for mechanistic tests. We have partnered with the Study of Muscle, Mobility and Aging (R01 AG059416) to obtain
primary human myoblasts from well phenotyped older adults to develop a three-dimensional tissue model of
skeletal muscle aging. Developments in tissue engineering using primary cells purified directly from patients offer
some of the best opportunities yet to link specific mechanistic tests of metabolic and muscle function to patient
data. We will adapt our in vivo contraction protocols for in vitro use to test the hypothesis that aging impairs
metabolic response following contraction in human three-dimensional engineered muscle tissue (3D-EMT). We
will test this hypothesis with two specific aims: 1) Examine the mitochondrial mechanisms of decreased metabolic
response to muscle contraction in aged human 3D-EMT and 2) we will characterize the effect of aging on
adaptation to longitudinal contractile training of 3D-EMT in vitro. This proposal will capitalize on the stellar
environment for aging and muscle research at University of Washington (UW). The UW houses a Nathan Shock
Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging, the Center for Translational Muscle Research, Northwest
Metabolomics Research Center, and the Institute for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine. The research team
comprises experts in the fields of muscle mechanics, mitochondrial function, metabolism, and tissue engineering
and uniquely places them in a position to implement the development of this in vitro model and to successfully
test muscle and mitochondrial function."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a global issue that must be solved urgently because of its significant impact on public
health and economics, as well as the quality of life of individuals in the United States and other aging societies.
Once cognitive impairment occurs in the AD continuum, there are great difficulties in modifying the devastating
disease process. Pathological changes inside the brain begin silently many years before the onset of cognitive
impairment. This long “preclinical” stage provides us with an opportunity for timely therapeutic and preventive
interventions. Therefore, the development of tools that can predict future cognitive decline during the preclinical
stage of AD is crucial. There is a consensus that neurodegeneration has a stronger correlation with cognition in
the disease progression along the AD continuum, compared to the diagnostic AD biomarkers such as amyloid
and tau proteins. In contrast, neuroimaging modalities currently used to detect biomarkers for neurodegeneration
are not sensitive enough to detect minute changes during the preclinical stage of AD. Here, Dr. Yuto Uchida
hypothesized that myeloarchitectonic features observed in the entorhinal-hippocampus pathway could serve as
sensitive neurodegenerative biomarkers given that AD pathogenesis occurs in the entorhinal cortices. In this
project, he will conduct a proof-of-concept study to examine microstructural neurodegeneration of the entorhinal-
hippocampus pathway in a combined framework: ex vivo ultra-high-field quantitative MRI followed by histological
verification in Aim 1, and in vivo ultra-high-field quantitative MRI in clinical settings for healthy controls in Aim 2
and for preclinical and prodromal AD individuals in Aim 3. In Aim 1, postmortem hemibrains will be scanned on
a human 7T MRI scanner and compared with the corresponding histology in the entorhinal-hippocampus
pathway to fill the gap between the MRI findings and microscopic observations. In Aim 2 and Aim 3, cutting-edge,
deep learning-based susceptibility tensor imaging (DeepSTI) and DeepSTI-based tractography will be applied
to an ongoing cohort study (RF1AG071515), which comprises healthy, preclinical, and prodromal AD individuals.
In Aim 2, reference ranges for quantitative MRI measures in the entorhinal layer II and the perforant path fibers
will be established. In Aim 3, comparative analyses of these quantitative MRI measures among the groups will
be done cross-sectionally, which will be followed by a longitudinal study to examine these associations with
cognitive decline along the AD continuum. In summary, the long-term objective of this K99/R00 application is to
support Dr. Yuto Uchida’s ability to conduct studies aimed at developing biomarkers for neurodegeneration that
can visualize and quantify microstructural brain alterations during the preclinical stage of AD using ultra-high-
field quantitative MRI. Dr. Uchida will be co-mentored by Drs. Kenichi Oishi, Xu Li, Jeremias Sulam, Hanzhang
Lu, and Juan C. Troncoso, who are experts in neuroanatomy, MRI physics, deep learning-based algorithms,
neurofunction, and histopathology, respectively. Having multiple mentors with different areas of expertise can
broaden Dr. Uchida’s technical and scientific skills and further his goal of becoming an independent investigator."
10950061,"The broad, long term objective of this project is to elucidate the role that the B cell arm of the immune system
plays in the pathophysiology of aging from the stand-point of, and hypothesis that, B cells and the antibodies
they make play a pathogenic role. The specific focus of the present application is to elucidate the
immunoglobulin repertoire of B cells present in human cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) samples in comparison with
B cells circulating in the periphery to determine the extent to which there is B cell intermingling between the
periphery and the central nervous system (CNS) in old age. This work is designed to test a novel and
unexplored mechanism underlying the dyscrasias of aging and associated neurodegeneration.
 B cells exist in the CNS of healthy people as evidenced by their presence in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF).
Where do these B cells come from and how do they end up in the CNS? B cells in the periphery circulate
throughout the body but one place they do not enter is the central nervous system (protected by the blood
brain barrier). Or do they? We addressed this issue by analyzing antibodies produced by individual B cells,
because antibody sequence can act as an address or identifier for each B cell. We found that CNS B cells
constitute a population separate and distinct from peripheral B cells in healthy young human volunteers. A
recent study of young mice by another group confirmed that CNS B cells are completely separate and distinct
from peripheral B cells in these animals…BUT, of greater consequence, the same study reported that in old
mice, the antibody repertoires of CNS and peripheral B cells overlapped to a significant extent, indicating
translocation/migration of peripheral B cells to the CNS. It is now imperative to determine whether the same
occurs in old people, as this could constitute a mechanism whereby autoreactive B cells gain access to the
CNS and promote inflammation, which is considered an important factor in cognitive aging and the
pathogenesis of neurodegenerative illness. The unknown degree to which peripheral B cells contribute to the
population of CNS B cells in old people represents a key gap in knowledge whose resolution is likely to have
important implications for concepts regarding normal physiology and disease pathology. We propose to test
the hypothesis that B cells in the CSF are related to peripheral B cells in old people.
 We will evaluate the phenotypic nature of CSF vs peripheral blood B cells by immunofluorescent
staining in old and young people. We will evaluate overlap between CSF and peripheral blood B cells by
PCR amplification and then sequence analysis of B cell-expressed antibodies from samples obtained from
the same individuals at the same time. This work will provide completely new information concerning the
hypothesis that B cells move from the periphery to the CNS in old age, and in so doing contribute to age-
associated degeneration and disease initiation and/or exacerbation. If true, a new paradigm will form for
future studies in basic and clinical neuroimmunology."
10950247,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Endometriosis, a debilitating chronic disease, affects around 10% of reproductive age women worldwide,
severely impacting quality-of-life. Unfortunately, there is often a decade-long delay from first symptom onset to
definitive diagnosis, underscoring the urgent need for improved earlier diagnostics. Evidence suggests that local
endometrial immune microenvironment (EIM) dysregulation may play a key factor in endometriosis pathobiology.
Even though uterine NK (uNK) cells are the predominant cytolytic lymphocyte in the EIM, they have been
surprisingly understudied in endometriosis. The objective of this proposal is to gain a better understanding of the
contribution of uNK cells to endometriosis and to identify non-invasive menstrual blood (MB) biomarkers that can
be leveraged for diagnosis. I hypothesize that defective cytolysis of endometrial stromal cells by dysregulated
uNK cells contributes to an abnormal tissue environment in endometriosis. The work in this proposal will be
completed at Stanford University School of Medicine in Dr. Gaudilliere’s laboratory (primary mentor) with
guidance from an interdisciplinary mentoring team at UCSF (Dr. Giudice, Dr. Sirota) and Duke University (Dr.
Coyne). A rigorous research training plan is proposed that harnesses cutting-edge high-dimensional single-cell
suspension and spatial immune profiling, sparse machine learning methods, and ex vivo assembloid modeling.
Aim 1 (K99) will characterize the inhibitory/activating receptor repertoire and functional capacity of uNK cells of
women with and without endometriosis (scRNAseq and mass cytometry). In addition, examining the spatial
organization of the EIM will provide crucial insight into microenvironmental interactions that underlie immune
responses in healthy and diseased endometrium (imaging mass cytometry). This aim builds on my current
expertise in human reproductive immunology and multi-parameter approaches and is a continuation of prior work
showing that uNK cells predominate in the EIM and exhibit a tissue-specific receptor profile. In Aim 2, an
innovative MB immunoassay will be established on the mass cytometry platform (K99) by discerning the
similarities and disparities between biopsy and MB-derived uNK cells. In the R00 phase, high-dimensional
predictive modeling will identify uNK cell features in MB that accurately classify endometriosis versus control. In
Aim 3, through Dr. Coyne’s training (K99), endometrial assembloids derived from primary MB-derived
endometrial cells will be established to replicate the EIM ex vivo. In the R00 phase, uNK cells will be incorporated
into this assembloid model to further investigate uNK-mediated mechanisms in abnormal endometrial tissue. In
summary, the proposed studies will uncover fundamental uNK cell mechanisms that contribute to endometriosis
pathobiology and establish a foundation for developing non-invasive diagnostics. The training, approach, and
results generated will offer a unique framework for future research on various uterine and reproductive disorders,
aiding my career development and enabling me to become an independent academic translational scientist in
reproductive immunology, bridging systems immunology, assembloid modelling, and computational biology."

Chronic pain is a widespread concern, affecting 12% of young adults globally (ages 18-29). These individuals
face significant burden, including the risk of chronic pain continuation from childhood and elevated rates of
depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. While psychological treatments have shown efficacy in adults and
adolescents, their effectiveness in young adults remains uncertain. An important challenge is how to develop
and maximize psychological treatments for young adults, who experience significant barriers to accessing
treatment. We are at a crucial point in the development of effective care for young adults with chronic pain, with
a priority being to address the lack of availability of treatments developed specifically for this population. Mobile
Health (mHealth) interventions (smartphone apps), and in particular those that leverage just-in-time adaptive
mechanisms (JITAI) are a promising solution for improving access to and use of psychological strategies for
pain management, particularly in young adults. JITAI leverage real-time, real-world data (i.e., smartphone
surveys and passive sensing) to deliver personalized support. However, the lack of real-time data on
contextual vulnerabilities that predict pain in young adults is a significant gap in knowledge impeding
development of personalized mobile interventions. Our proposed K23 research aims to fill this knowledge gap,
leveraging ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to develop and test a mobile ""just-in-time"" adaptive
intervention (JITAI) for young adults with chronic pain. Using advanced methodologies, we will (1) conduct a
study using ecological momentary assessment to identify contextual vulnerabilities that predict exacerbations
in pain in young adults to inform JITAI targets; (2) use findings from the EMA study and input from young adult
patient partners to develop a mobile app JITAI prototype including tailored messages suggesting brief or more
effortful psychological strategie; and (3) pilot the JITAI using a 28-day micro-randomized trial (MRT) to assess
different message types' impact on engagement in the strategies. The expected outcomes of this research
include preliminary data on dynamic pain predictors (EMA) and proof-of-concept methodologies (micro-
randomized JITAI) for a large-scale MRT for Optimization. Furthermore, I will be well-positioned to launch my
career, leveraging cutting-edge digital approaches for personalized, scalable mobile health intervention for
chronic pain. The study and training activities included in this proposal will advance my knowledge and skills in
multilevel longitudinal methods, designing JITAIs, utilizing micro-randomized trials to optimize JITAIs, young
adult pain management and engagement, and conducting clinical trials. Leveraging advancements in theory,
digital methodologies, and human-centered design holds promise in creating a new generation personalized
mobile interventions that can reduce the burden of pain and improve the lives of young adults."

 Among working-age U.S. adults, diabetic retinopathy remains the leading cause of blindness despite
landmark National Eye Institute (NEI) clinical trials showing that early detection and treatment reduce the risk of
severe vision loss by over 90%. Yet adherence with yearly diabetic retinopathy screening in the U.S remains
below half of patients in rural communities. Ocular telemedicine (i.e. teleophthalmology) can substantially
increase diabetic retinopathy screening rates and prevent blindness. However, there is often very limited use of
this technology even after a teleophthalmology program is established in multi-payer health systems, where the
majority of Americans receive their care. To overcome major barriers identified for teleophthalmology use in rural
multi-payer primary care clinics, the PI developed and piloted Implementation to Sustain Impact in
Teleophthalmology (I-SITE) in a NEI K23 Career Development Award. I-SITE is the first implementation program
specifically designed to overcome barriers to teleophthalmology use by tailoring its integration into rural primary
care clinic workflows. The proposed study is a multi-center randomized controlled trial aiming to: (1) test the
effectiveness of I-SITE, (2) identify explanatory factors and implementation components that distinguish high
and low teleophthalmology use in rural health systems following I-SITE implementation, and (3) evaluate
implementation costs. We hypothesize that I-SITE will sustain significant diabetic eye screening rate increases
at 18 months compared to usual care teleophthalmology.
 This UG1 proposal directly responds to multiple elements of the NEI Strategic Plan, including areas of
emphasis in telemedicine, diabetic retinopathy, and expanding access to eye care in rural populations. This
research will facilitate the effective translation of telemedicine technology in rural multi-payer primary care clinics
to improve diabetic retinopathy screening rates. The effective integration and scale-up of ocular telemedicine
would greatly expand eye care access for millions of rural Americans. This will be critical for preventing avoidable
blindness by overcoming the shortage of eye care providers and meeting the increased demand for eye
screening resulting from major projected increases in diabetes prevalence. As we face
unprecedented challenges to our nation's health systems, never before in our history has the need for a
rapid transition to telehealth been more acute. Our study will provide vital knowledge regarding the
methods and factors needed to successfully translate telehealth technology into widespread clinical
practice for improving public health nationwide."

associated with CVD. CV toxicities are more common among marginalized racial and ethnic groups. They are
also more common among individuals at lower levels of socioeconomic and insurance status, as well as those
living in disadvantaged neighborhoods or rural areas. Yet, the complex role of these factors—social
determinants of health (SDOH)—in CV toxicity disparities among BC survivors is unknown, and few studies
have considered the intersections among race, ethnicity, and SDOH. Given the known relationship between
SDOH and cardiometabolic dysfunction, disparities in SDOH may contribute to CV toxicities among BC
survivors through increased risk of comorbid cardiometabolic dysfunction. Therefore, to improve the CV health
of BC survivors, it is critical to examine CV toxicity disparities in the context of cardiometabolic dysfunction. To
address this issue, the following specific aims will be completed:
 1) Identify the extent of disparities in incident CV toxicity among BC survivors in Arkansas based on
 race, ethnicity, neighborhood socioeconomic status, and geography.
 2) Develop a predictive algorithm for risk stratification in BC survivors at high risk for CV toxicity using
 machine learning approaches that incorporate race, ethnicity, and SDOH.
 Data collected from 2013–2019 in the Arkansas All-Payer Claims Database (APCD) linked to the Cancer
Registry, as well as clinical and refined SDOH information from the electronic health records system at the
University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, will be utilized in this study. A longitudinal analysis for the
development of CV toxicities in women with a first diagnosis of BC (stage I–III), with passive follow-up in the
claims data through 2023, will be conducted. Machine-learning methods will be used to develop an algorithm
that predicts CV toxicities among BC survivors based on race, ethnicity, complex SDOH, and other clinical
factors. This K01 will: 1) provide training in social epidemiology and health disparities; 2) promote research
skills using large-scale, longitudinal administrative healthcare data; 3) develop competence in advanced
analytic methods; and 4) increase understanding of BC survivorship and provide content expertise in cardio-
oncology research. This study responds to the NHLBI's compelling question (5.CQ.10) to reduce cardiac
morbidity and mortality in cancer survivors. By identifying factors that contribute to health disparities in CVD
among BC survivors and using them to predict CV toxicity, this research can inform targeted interventions
(e.g., multidimensional intervention programs addressing race, ethnicity, and multiple SDOH) to improve the
CV health of this population."

Clinical predictors are now firmly incorporated into routine standard-of-care in many fields of medicine, in contrast
with Psychiatry where quantitative predictors that guide clinical decision-making remain extremely
limited. Psychosis-related disorders are responsible for a substantial public health burden, for which there are
significant unmet needs that would be subserved by clinical predictors. For example, long-term outcomes vary
widely and identifying individuals with poor or advantageous future outcomes would help to optimize treatment
planning and resource allocation. Furthermore, antipsychotics are associated with adverse side effects, such as
increased risk of diabetes. In this application, we propose to use machine learning approaches to build predictors
and identify subtypes of clinical outcomes among individuals with schizophrenia, through integration of
longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), dimensional phenotyping, and genetic analyses. We will also
explore the psychosocial and ethical implications of psychiatric clinical predictors. Our long-term objective is to
advance the goals of Precision Psychiatry to achieve individualized treatment planning, outcome monitoring, and
preventive interventions. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Leverage two independent EHR
databases for outcome prediction and sub-classification of psychosis-related disorders. (a) We will use
the longitudinal PSYCKES and MarketScan databases to build machine learning-based individual-level
prediction models to forecast the onset of four major prognostic outcomes: treatment response (antipsychotic
resistance), illness severity (long-term hospitalization), medical comorbidity (diabetes), and diagnostic transition
from a psychosis-related disorder to schizophrenia. (b) We will perform cohort-level analyses using unsupervised
methods to discover novel psychosis-related diagnosis and prognosis subtypes. Aim 2: Enhance predictive
modeling through dimensional phenotyping and whole genome sequencing. (a) We will recruit n = 10,000
patients with schizophrenia from the PSYCKES database population for enriched data collection: 1) dimensional
phenotyping (cognition, exposome, and social determinants of health), and 2) whole genome sequencing to
enable calling of rare variants, structural variants, and common variants (polygenic risk). (b) We will investigate
the extent to which dimensional phenotypes and genomic data can improve the models developed in Aim 1. Aim
3: Explore the psychosocial and ethical implications of psychiatric clinical predictors. (a) We will survey
a subset of patients and their clinicians regarding their attitudes towards implementation of clinical outcome
predictors. (b) We will return pathogenic findings to patients through genetic counseling and survey the
experience of patients and their clinicians on their emotional reactions and perceptions of impairment, treatability,
and life-planning."
10944835,"Transgender and gender-nonbinary (TNB) adolescents may receive gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT)
with estradiol or testosterone to induce desired secondary sex characteristics, relieve gender dysphoria, and
improve mental health. Because GAHT is given during a crucial phase of brain development, many parents
and caregivers raise concerns about the potential effects of GAHT on brain development. Currently, the field
lacks empirical data on the effects of GAHT on brain structure and function in TNB adolescents. To address
this gap, we will conduct an observational, longitudinal study that will enroll 80 TNB adolescents (40
transfeminine and 40 transmasculine) who are starting GAHT as a part of their clinical care, and we will study
participants before and after 12 months of GAHT using state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques. We will
specifically evaluate the structure and functional connectivity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
region of the brain, which is involved in regulating core executive functions, which are key determinants of
goal-directed behaviors, academic success, and personal autonomy. To account for normal age-related
changes in these neuroimaging outcomes, we will compare changes in our cohort to developmental changes
seen in cisgender adolescents from the general population using data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive
Development (ABCD) study, a prospective investigation of 11,878 children recruited nationwide that has made
data freely available to researchers. We will also investigate the association of neuroimaging changes in our
cohort with changes in the three core executive functions: response inhibition, cognitive flexibility, and working
memory. In addition, we will explore the correlations between changes in neuroimaging findings and changes
in symptoms of anxiety and depression. To account for changes in these neurocognitive and psychological
outcomes that occur normally with age, we have carefully selected measures that give scores that are
standardized for age. Our study will a) evaluate the effects of GAHT (estradiol and testosterone) on DLPFC
structure and function, and b) characterize the associations of GAHT-related changes with executive function
tasks and with symptoms of anxiety and depression. Our investigation will provide pragmatic data about the
effects of GAHT on brain changes in TNB adolescents and its relation to executive function to enable clinicians
to counsel patients and families about these effects and to eventually develop approaches to optimize
cognitive and educational outcomes."
10944871,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Using a combination of genetics and experimental evolution, our team seeks to understand complex epistasis
with respect to genetic background in the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. This yeast is an ideal
platform for such investigations due to 1) its facile genetics, 2) the availability of hundreds of phylogenetically
well-separated genomes, and 3) mouse infection models that recapitulate key aspects of human disease. Most
studies have been performed with a reference strain, the clinical isolate H99, or in congenic derivatives (KN99a
and KN99). In unpublished work, our lab has generated a gene deletion strain collection in the KN99
background and profiled it in mice and in over 100 diverse in vitro conditions. A reference strain is important for
the field to be able to compare findings, but it has a major weakness: across genetic backgrounds, it is unknown
whether the same genes are 1) essential for viability, 2) mediate the responses to small molecule challenges,
and 3) are required for fitness in the mammalian host. In addition to being of fundamental scientific importance,
answering these questions, which all relate to the larger question of complex epistasis, is important for
developing effective therapies across genetic backgrounds and understanding drug resistance. Population
genomic analyses have revealed that C. neoformans exists in roughly four major clades that diverged ~5 million
years ago and show evidence of speciation. Over a million SNPs have been identified in a set of nearly 400
strains. Members of each clade have been identified in human infections, and there is evidence for clade-
specific traits. Anecdotal studies have provided examples of strain-specific phenotypes, raising the question of
what genotype-phenotype relationships are general vs. dependent on genetic background and the underlying
mechanisms. Powerful new CRISPR/Cas9-based tools that we have recently developed and other
technological advances now make it feasible to address this fundamental question. In this work, we will
determine how Cryptococcus neoformans genetic background impacts the fundamental traits of gene
essentiality (Aim 1), the role of genes in fitness in the mammalian host (Aim 2), and the fitness roles of genes
under diverse environments (Aim 3). We will pursue mechanisms of the latter through experimental evolution
(Aim 3)."
10947158,"Summary:
Moment-to-moment changes in synaptic strength are a dynamic property of many synapses including in
regions of the brain known to be important for episodic memories. In the hippocampus synaptic transmission at
mossy fiber (MF) synapses between dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells and CA3 pyramidal cells, displays a
large dynamic range of release that acts as a high pass filter for activating CA3 neurons during high frequency
bursts in the DG. It has been proposed that the MF connection is a teaching signal that is critical for the ability
of the CA3 network to encode the details necessary to separate similar instances as distinct episodic
memories. Despite the potential importance of MF synaptic facilitation to the separation of similar patterns,
direct empirical evidence for this has been lacking. The goal of this proposal is to test how the unique dynamic
properties of MF synapses contribute to the ability of an animal to distinguish similar spatial representations.
We will take advantage of the finding that a specialized presynaptic Ca2+ sensor, with high affinity and slow
kinetics, is the key to the large activity-dependent facilitation of release of neurotransmitter at MF synapses.
We propose that elimination of this sensor in MF synapses in a newly created conditional knockout animal will
1. alter the dynamics of the MF synapse, 2. disrupt the high pass filter properties of the CA3 circuit and 3.
ultimately impact specific cognitive processes that impair the ability of mice to separate similar patterns in
space. This short, focused project is designed to test a circumscribed question that will explicitly establish
whether MF synaptic dynamics can map onto cognitive processes that underlie pattern separation."
10945479,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Medical device-associated microbial infection arises from pathogenic bacterial adhesion and subsequent
biofilm formation on devices. It is known that bacterial intracellular nucleotide second messenger signaling
plays an important role in biofilm development. Interference with these nucleotides signaling could provide a
novel approach to address the problem of pathogenic biofilm formation on biomaterial surfaces. This
application proposes to synthesize small molecule derivates of 4-arylazo-3,5-diamino-1H-pyrazole (named as
SP02, SP03, and SP04) and tether them to polyurethane (PU) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) biomaterial
surfaces so that the small molecules can interfere with nucleotide signaling and interrupt biofilm formation in a
way that will both reduce the formation of biofilms and increase the antibiotic efficacy for treating biofilms that
do develop. Through testing 4 clinically relevant pathogenic biofilm bacteria on modified surfaces in vitro and in
vivo, a new approach for creation of improved antimicrobial biomaterials for implantable medical devices such
as catheters will be developed. The central hypothesis is that “biomaterial surfaces tethered with small
molecule derivates of 4-arylazo-3,5-diamino-1H-pyrazole can inhibit and interrupt biofilm formation and growth
by interfering with intracellular nucleotide signaling. This leads to disruption of biofilm formation and increases
efficacy of antibiotics, therefore making microbial infection treatable using standard antibiotic therapy.” To test
this hypothesis, four specific aims are proposed. Aims 1 and 2 will focus on in vitro assessment of the
effectiveness of three small molecules and these small molecules bonded PU and PDMS biomaterial surfaces
for inhibiting biofilm formation and increasing antibiotic efficacies, as well as addressing biocompatibility. The
nucleotide levels and RNAseq will be quantified to determine the effects of small molecules on bacterial
intracellular nucleotide signaling. Through these experiments, the molecule tethering approach that leads to
the greatest inhibition of biofilm formation will be identified for in vivo studies. Aim 3 will test the antibacterial
properties and tissue response to small molecule modified biomaterials using a 7-day subcutaneous infection
rat model to validate the findings of small molecule functionalized polymers identified from Aims 1 and 2. To
accelerate the application of new approach in medical devices, commercial pediatric central venous catheters
will be modified with small molecules. Biofilm formation and antibiotic efficacies will be tested using a total
implantable venous access port (TIVAP) in vitro and in vivo in Aim 4. The success of experiments described
will allow progression to in vivo studies of other medical devices and large animal studies for preclinical trials,
as well as providing important basic science information on nucleotide messenger signaling in biofilm formation
and control."
10947385,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDAC) is the most common form of pancreatic cancer and is highly lethal and
resistant to therapy. There is a need to explore new, effective, strategies to treat PDAC, given that only ~10% of
the patients survive beyond five years. PDAC overutilize extracellular nutrients to sustain their growth. This
nutrient dependency, coupled with a low blood supply, limits nutrient availability in the PDAC microenvironment.
To achieve therapy and improve patient survival outcome, it is important to understand how PDAC survive in the
nutrient-limited condition and the tumor-intrinsic or microenvironmental factors that sustain their survival. In this
proposal, we show that PDAC cells rely on cysteine at a far greater extent than other amino acids. Metabolomics
profiling revealed that the PDAC cells almost exclusively use cysteine to sustain intracellular glutathione (GSH).
While some PDAC cells rapidly generate GSH when starved of cysteine, others maintain their GSH pool when
starved of both cysteine and arginine, indicating the use of various mechanisms to sustain GSH and survival in
PDAC cells. In addition, we found that under the same cysteine starvation, macrophages produce GSH, which
is an important discovery given the high abundance of macrophages in PDAC microenvironment, their arginine
catabolic function, and that the macrophage-derived GSH could sustain PDAC. In multiple gene expression
datasets of patient tumors, we observed that PDAC express a high level of GSH pathway genes. Based on these
data, we hypothesize that GSH is a core nutrient required for PDAC growth, is potentially sustained by
tumor-associated macrophages, and that disrupting GSH utilization could improve therapy in PDAC. The
aims of this study are 1). to determine the molecular mechanisms driving the dependency of PDAC on GSH –
including the epigenetic regulation of GSH pathway, and 2). to determine the role of tumor-associated
macrophages as a source and modulator of GSH in PDAC. The overarching goal is to explore whether blocking
GSH utilization alone or alongside macrophage activities could be a way to improve PDAC therapy. Aim 1 will
be pursued at the K99 phase, while most of Aim 2 will be pursued at the R00 phase. Methods will include gene
interference (e.g., CRISPR/Cas9, shRNA, siRNA), pharmacological inhibitors of GSH pathways (including the
pentose phosphate pathway), cell culture assays, metabolomics (including stable isotope tracing), dietary mouse
models, bioinformatics, promoter analysis/epigenetic methods, RNA sequencing (single cell and bulk),
immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and mass cytometry. The project will receive input from a 5-person
mentorship team that have expertise in tumor immunology, metabolism, bioinformatics, and epigenetics. The
expected results could a) offer new insights on disrupting GSH pathway to suppress PDAC growth, b) reveal
new microenvironmental mechanisms that enable tumor adaptation in nutrient-limited state, and c) reveal new
opportunities to overcome resistance to chemotherapy or immunotherapy in PDAC."
10944301,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway plays an essential role in health and
diseases from cancer to neurodegeneration. Of the three UPR pathway branches, the
IRE1-XBP1 pathway is the most highly conserved in comparison with the PERK and
ATF6 pathways. It has been shown that selective genetic activation of XBP1 in the IRE1
pathway is effective in multiple neurodegenerative disorders from Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) to Parkinson’s disease (PD). Using an XBP1-driven luciferase reporter system, we
screened a library of newly designed macrocycles called rapafucins that are modeled after
the immunosuppressive and anticancer drug rapamycin and identified an activator of
XBP1 named Rapireon. Further characterization of Rapireon revealed that it acts as a
molecule glue by recruiting FKBP12 to form a ternary complex with the cytosolic
domain of IRE1. Moreover, the FKBP12-Rapireon complex was found to selectively
activate the nuclease activity of IRE1 without affecting its kinase activity. In this
application, we propose to carry out in-depth characterization of the mode of action of
Rapireon using both biochemical and structural biology approaches. In preliminary
studies, we already obtained a low-resolution cryo-EM structural model of the FKBP12-
Rapireon-IRE1 ternary complex. We will continue to collect more data and refine the the
structure to better than 2.5 Å resolution. In parallel, we will build on our existing high-
resolution (below 2 Å) FKBP12-Rapireon binary complex x-ray crystal structure and
attempt to obtain the crystal structure of the ternary complex. To improve the potency
and specificity of the existing Rapireon lead, we will design and synthesize a DNA-
encoded library (DEL) of Rapireon analogs and develop a solution-phase proximity
ligation/deep sequencing platform to identify new analogs of Rapireon from the DEL.
Once a potent lead compound is identified, we will attempt to improve the
pharmacokinetic property and bioavailability of Rapireon through structural optimization
of Raprieon, giving rise to a Rapireon analog that can serve as a tool compound for
exploring its potential in treating neurodegenerative diseases."

 Neonatal mortality remains high in sub-Saharan Africa, where 43% of global neonatal deaths occur. In
rural, low-income health facilities, contaminated drinking water and environmental hygiene conditions put
newborns and their mothers at risk for healthcare-associated infections, including antibiotic resistant infections.
In Kenya, health facilities are typically limited to water treatment with manual, point-of-use products that require
extensive effort to use and are insufficient for the volumes of safe water required to provide quality healthcare.
Our team has developed a low-cost, in-line chlorination technology, the Venturi, that automatically doses chlorine
without moving parts or electricity, and is able to use chlorine produced by an off-the-shelf electrochlorinator,
which can produce chlorine disinfectant solution using only water, salt, and intermittent electricity.
 We propose to conduct a cluster-randomized controlled trial across 30 health facilities to generate
rigorous evidence on the maternal and neonatal health benefits of chlorinated water supply paired with on-site
generation of chlorine for disinfection. This study combines our team’s expertise in engineering, epidemiology,
microbiology, and pediatric medicine to accomplish the following aims: 1) determine the impact of the intervention
on pathogenic and antibiotic resistant bacteria contamination in water supplies, high-touch surfaces, and
healthcare worker hands, 2) quantify intervention effects on gut colonization of mothers and neonates by a panel
of pathogenic and antibiotic resistant bacteria species linked to neonatal infection, using molecular and culture-
based methods, and 3) follow up with >20,000 mother-neonate dyads to measure intervention effects on
symptoms of severe bacterial infection in the first week of life.
 Infection prevention through effective water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) has been cited by national
action plans as a key tool in the fight against antimicrobial resistance and, while global data show dire WASH
conditions in low- and middle-income (LMIC) health facilities, there exists very little guidance for implementing
effective interventions. This proposal is a time sensitive opportunity to leverage substantial philanthropic funding
to deliver a novel and scalable intervention to health facilities. The overarching goal is to generate actionable
evidence to inform investments in chlorination at health facilities to improve neonatal health and reduce the threat
of antibiotic resistant infections."

Microsurgical models of murine organ transplantation have played a critical role in advancing our 
understanding of immunological pathways that regulate graft rejection and tolerance. Such 
models are important tools to develop therapies for transplant patients. As substantial differences 
exist between immune responses to various grafts, insights gained in one organ cannot be 
translated to other organs. Our laboratories have developed clinically relevant models of lung 
transplantation and re-transplantation in the mouse as well as novel approaches to image immune 
cell interactions in the murine pulmonary graft in real time. We and others have used these 
approaches to investigate clinically relevant lung-specific alloimmune responses. A dedicated 
microsurgery core was established at the initiation of this program project in 2015. The 
microsurgery core has proven instrumental in facilitating the execution of the experiments. In aim 
1 we will continue to standardize the quality of microsurgical and imaging procedures for all three 
projects in the proposal. In aim 2 we will continue to standardize assessment of graft function and 
tissue harvest for all three projects. In aim 3 we will maintain a system that provides unfettered 
access to microsurgical transplants and coordinates intravital imaging procedures for Projects 1 
and 3."
10948847,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Social deficits are a primary characteristic of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The social motivation hypothesis
posits that these deficits reflect alterations in social information processing, including a blunted reward response
to social stimuli. Neuroimaging research suggests this blunting may generalize beyond the social domain. Given
the considerable resources devoted to motivation and reinforcement-based interventions, it is essential to identify
the extent that blunted reward processing influences the entire spectrum of autism (i.e., beyond social motivation)
and to identify the neural mechanisms that contribute to said blunting. Proposed aims make substantive progress
towards answering these questions in neurotypical (NT; N=50) vs. autistic (N=50) youths. We focus on emerging
adolescence (10-15 years; 20% female reflecting autism prevalence) as it is a critical phase of development
when peer feedback gains salience in NT youth and social deficits increase in autistic youth. Significance is
derived from three factors. First, we address two shortcomings in fMRI study design that have hindered progress
towards isolating ASD-related differences in reward processing: A) Most studies fail to directly compare neural
response to social (e.g., viewing a smiling face) and non-social (e.g., winning money) outcomes. B) Social stimuli
typically used to study reward fail to model the experience of actually being liked by peers (i.e., direct social
reward). To overcome these shortcomings, we developed an fMRI-based feedback paradigm that quantifies
neural response to reward in social (being liked) and non-social (winning money) domains. Aim 1 uses this
paradigm to isolate differences in neural response to social and non-social reward. This will be the first fMRI
study to test ASD-related neural response to direct social reward. Second, we address a major knowledge gap
in the social motivation hypothesis - the extent to which ASD symptoms relate to dopamine (DA) system function
in brain. Animal models of autism suggest that DA system dysfunction contributes to blunted reward processing.
However, testing human correlates has proved challenging because it requires invasive techniques involving
radioactivity. Recent advances have demonstrated that neuromelanin-MRI (NM-MRI) can be used as a non-
invasive proxy for measuring DA system function. Aim 2 quantifies differences in midbrain DA system function
via NM-MRI. If awarded, this study will be the first to apply NM-MRI in ASD research. Third, in Aim 3, we lay the
foundation for a novel approach to individualized treatment by testing the extent to which DA system function
influences relations between ASD and blunted reward response. Gold standard interventions (e.g., Applied
Behavioral Analysis, ABA) rely on intact reward processing for maximal effect. If DA system deficits diminish
neural response to reward, this may explain variation in treatment outcomes. NM-MRI could identify those who
may benefit most (or least) from ABA, and identify novel pharmacological targets to treat core symptoms of ASD."
10950285,"War has led to many disabling health challenges among our Veterans. One very significant challenge is
traumatic brain injury (TBI) which resulted from Veterans’ exposure to improvised explosive devices (IEDs)
during the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. Although the effects of most mild (m)TBIs resolve in days or weeks, a
significant number of our Veterans, estimated at 23-48%, have persistent symptoms relating to their mTBI that
impact daytime functioning, ability to work, mental and physical wellness and quality of life. Since treatment
options are limited for this disorder and its persistent symptoms, new viable treatment strategies need to be
studied. Neurofeedback (NFB) has been shown to affect cortical neuroplasticity and contribute to neuro-
neuronal rehabilitation by changing connectivities of specific areas of the brain that may have been impaired
and these changes appear to be permanent. Over 25 case and small studies have provided evidence that
NFB, which uses brain wave feedback strategies via gaming simulations, has led to a variety of improved mTBI
outcomes. The next logical step is to conduct a clinical trial to provide further support that NFB can impact
persistent post concussive symptoms that are experienced by Veterans.
The study’s objective will be to evaluate NFB training as a low risk, non-invasive, effective treatment for our
Veterans who had an mTBI, also referred to as concussion, while serving in the military. The particular chronic
post-concussive symptoms targeted will be headache, insomnia, and attentional difficulties. Perceived quality
of life will also be assessed pre and post intervention. It is hypothesized that when compared to the control
group that receives usual standard care, those Veterans who receive NFB training, along with usual standard
care, will have: 1) greater reduction in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of headaches; 2) greater
improvement of sleep efficiency and/or perceptions of quality of sleep; 3) more improved attention; and 4)
improved perceptions of quality of life.
Specific aims will be to compare the NFB treatment group (receiving 20, 1-hour sessions plus usual care) with
a control group (receiving only usual care) on improvement in clinical symptoms (insomnia, headaches,
attention difficulties and quality of life) as ascertained by the study instruments’ (that measure the clinical
symptoms) scores at baseline, midpoint, end of treatment and 2-month follow-up.
Study Design: This study will utilize a randomized control group design that includes a delayed post-control
intervention group to assess the impact of NFB on headaches, insomnia, attention difficulties, and quality of
life. Seventy-two Veterans with a deployment related mTBI who are experiencing headaches, insomnia, and
attention difficulties will be enrolled, 36 in the NFB treatment group and 36 in the control group. After control
group members complete the final assessment, they will be offered NFB. Thus, a total of 72 Veterans
(intervention and post-control) who complete all NFB sessions and evaluations will be the sample for this
project. Data will be analyzed between groups (intervention and control) and within the intervention groups.
Impact: The experience of headaches, insomnia, and attention difficulties can lead to debilitation in all areas of
Veterans’ lives. This project will provide evidence for the use of NFB with Veterans to alleviate their chronic
symptoms and enhance their quality of life. If supported, NFB will offer our Veterans an efficacious and non-
invasive treatment option. NFB is a patient focused intervention that enables Veterans the opportunity for self-
health management."
10950383,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Approximately 1.7 million children under 15 years old were living with HIV in 2020; and most new HIV infections
(85%) occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). People living with HIV (PLHIV) often struggle with mental health
comorbidities that lower their antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence. However, 76% to 85% of PLHIV in SSA
receive no treatment for serious mental health disorders, especially depression. Depression reduces ART
adherence, which negatively impacts health and increases HIV transmission risks. Older adolescents (≥14 years)
living with HIV are particularly vulnerable to these risks as caregivers withdraw or lessen their support during
their transition to young adulthood. Moreover, older adolescents are also moving into larger and less
accommodating adult HIV clinic settings and are at risk for dropping out of ART programs. Given that mental
health services are severely under equipped in SSA, including in Uganda, and are inaccessible by many YLHIV,
new solutions to increase access to mental health care and close the treatment gap are urgently needed. The
overall goal of this proposed R21/33 study is to develop an mHealth intervention (Suubi-mhealth) for use among
Ugandan youth (14-17 years) with comorbid HIV and depression, taking into account their unique contextual,
cultural, and developmental needs. This digital therapy intervention delivered via a mobile application, will
utilize the core tenets of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) found to improve depression and ART adherence.
The proposed study will specifically: Phase 1. R21 Aim 1: Develop and iteratively refine an intervention
protocol for Suubi-Mhealth based on formative work to understand needs of youth living with HIV (YLHIV). We
will conduct four focus groups with youth and two focus groups with health care providers (6-8 youth each) for
feedback on intervention content and methods to increase participation and retention. R21 Aim 2: Based on
results of Aim 1, explore the feasibility and acceptability
subsequent refinement for the larger R33 phase. Phase
of Suubi-Mhealth on a small scale (N=30), to inform
2. R33 Aim 1: Test the preliminary impact of Suubi-
Mhealth versus a waitlist control group (N=200), on youth outcomes (depression, ART adherence, mental health
functioning, quality of life, stigma). R33 Aim 2: Examine barriers and facilitators for integrating Suubi-Mhealth
into health care settings for YLHIV. The study will be conducted in 10 health clinics in the greater Masaka region
in Southern Uganda. We expect for Suubi-Mhealth to be an acceptable and feasible mHealth tool to reduce
depression, improve ART adherence and overall mental health functioning among YLHIV. If the results of this
pilot are promising, then the next step is an R01 to rigorously test Suubi-Mhealth in a larger trial, spanning
multiple sites across Uganda."

Pregnancy is a critical period of development: stress during pregnancy can lead to adverse birth
and long-term health outcomes, as well as compromise infant development. In the United
States, racial inequities in pregnancy and birth outcomes are stark and persistent, signaling the
need for novel interventions that address the social determinants of health. The California
Abundant Birth Project (CA-ABP) is a guaranteed income program for pregnant populations at
elevated risk of preterm birth in five California counties (San Francisco, Alameda, Contra Costa,
Riverside, and Los Angeles), funded by the State of California, municipal governments, and
philanthropic funding. The CA-ABP program will provide 12-18 months of unconditional, monthly
income supplements during pregnancy and postpartum to randomly selected participants, with
the goal of curbing financial stress and promoting healthy pregnancy outcomes.
The goal of the CA-ABP Evaluation is to use a rigorous, mixed-methods, community-based
participatory research approach to determine whether providing guaranteed income to Black
pregnant people can advance perinatal health equity through the reduction of adverse
pregnancy outcomes and stress, and improvements in maternal mental health and infant
development. The proposed project significantly expands the scope of the impact evaluation of
CA-ABP by adding three additional survey data collection timepoints (6-weeks postpartum, 6-
months postpartum, and 12-months postpartum) and medical records abstraction. The study
focuses on the subset of Black-identified participants to determine the impact of income
supplementation during pregnancy on: (1) perinatal health, as measured by composite
measures of adverse pregnancy outcomes (preterm birth, low birth weight, small-for-gestational
age, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes); (2) stress and perinatal
mental health (depression and anxiety); and (3) infant development.
Eliminating maternal and infant health inequities requires a paradigm shift in research,
interventions, and policies that emphasize upstream solutions rather than placing responsibility
on affected communities. Understanding the impact of CA-ABP on perinatal health and infant
development will provide the foundation for interventions that address stress and economic
inequality caused by structural racism. Conducting the evaluation in partnership with the
organizations implementing ABP provides a direct pathway to move forward the results for
policy change and sustainability."
10947955,"Most adults with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) do not achieve optimal glycemic control, and thus have increased
cardiovascular risk. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly common sleep disorder that is strongly linked to
cardiometabolic dysregulation. About 50% of adults with T1D have OSA. Among adults with T1D, those with
OSA have poorer glycemic control and have higher risk of diabetes-related complications. Despite strong
biological plausibility, it is unknown how OSA impacts glycemic control in T1D. Our overall goal is to investigate
the role OSA in glycemic dysregulation in adults with T1D. We hypothesize that OSA exerts negative effects on
glucose regulation in T1D, leading to suboptimal glycemic control and thus increasing cardiovascular risk in
T1D. We further hypothesize that suboptimal glycemic control in adults with T1D occurs in part through OSA-
induced alterations in counterregulatory hormone release and lipid metabolism, subsequently worsening
glycemic control. To test these hypotheses, we propose a rigorous sleep intervention study with a within-
subject, cross-over design in adults with T1D and OSA (n=40) who are using an insulin pump and continuous
glucose monitoring (CGM). Participants will be studied under two 14-day study conditions in randomized order
with a 4-week washout: untreated OSA and treated OSA. We will perform the same assessments in each
study condition. We will apply all-night CPAP intervention under continuous in-lab supervision to achieve
complete resolution of OSA. Thus, we will use CPAP as a tool to eliminate OSA i.e., “turn off” the disease
state. Participants will continue their daily routine activities outside the lab. Sleep will be objectively assessed
during the study. We will determine to what extent OSA contributes to suboptimal glycemic control in adults
with T1D (Aim1). We will compare 14-day CGM profiles (key clinical CGM metrics) between untreated OSA vs.
treated OSA conditions. We will also determine how alterations in counterregulatory hormone release and lipid
metabolism in the setting of OSA account for suboptimal glycemic control in adults with T1D (Aim 2). We will
compare 24-hour blood profiles under controlled in-lab conditions with standardized meals between untreated
OSA vs. treated OSA conditions and determine how specific hormonal (e.g., glucagon, catecholamines) and
metabolic factors contribute to glycemic dysregulation. We will concurrently assess additional biological and
behavioral factors: sleep stages (e.g., slow wave sleep), insulin dose, subjective sleepiness and sleep quality,
and diabetes self-management behaviors. We will also measure resting heart rate and 24-hour ambulatory
blood pressure, and fasting lipids to determine how OSA impacts these intermediate markers of cardiovascular
risk. The proposed work will be the first intervention study to rigorously examine the role of OSA in glycemic
dysregulation in adults with T1D. Our study will combine real-life and in-lab assessments to determine specific
biological and behavioral factors that may contribute to suboptimal glycemic control in adults with T1D and
OSA. The findings may help identify sleep as a novel intervention target to improve T1D management."

Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), reaches the lung alveoli where it is in contact
with the alveolar mucosa. This mucosal surface is lined by alveolar epithelial cells (ATs) and composed of a
monolayer formed by surfactant lipids and a hypophase, called alveolar lining fluid (or ALF), containing soluble
innate components and enzymes. M.tb is exposed to ALF for an undetermined period of time before and during
its engulfment by host cells, primarily alveolar macrophages (AMs) but also ATs, providing a shield for M.tb and
portal for dissemination. M.tb infection drives inflammation, which eventually attracts neutrophils, monocytes,
eosinophils and other innate cells entering the alveoli from the periphery. Following primary infection and
dissemination, tissue granulomas begin to develop. This proposal is in response to the specific RFA, “Analyzing
Early Events in TB and TB/HIV Infection for Interventional Targets”. These earliest interactions, i.e., how the lung
environment, specifically ALF and alveolar host cells interact with M.tb, are poorly understood, yet critical to
impacting eradication or progression of M.tb infection. Our research program is focused on these earliest events
for M.tb in the alveoli. Our data support the finding that M.tb’s interaction with ALF from HIV-infected individuals
(as well as elderly individuals), fundamentally remodels the bacterial surface and its metabolism thereby affecting
host cell entry, trafficking and host response, culminating in enhanced host susceptibility to infection. Thus, our
central hypothesis is that the first interactions of M.tb with soluble human ALF components shape its cell surface
and metabolic status, impacting its subsequent interactions with AMs and ATs, the two major resident alveolar
cell populations, and leading to control or spread of M.tb infection. To address our hypothesis, we will
systematically integrate our unique in vitro and in vivo models starting with single cell interactions and moving to
an innovative lung-on-chip infection model with time-lapse imaging to reveal the dynamics of host-
M.tb interactions at the air-liquid interface with spatiotemporal resolution, and an in vivo experimental approach
to assess early dynamic interactions in the alveoli using the rhesus macaque (RM) model. We will also delineate
the effects of HIV infection on alveolar composition & function, addressing how HIV’s effects drive M.tb faster
replication and dissemination within the alveoli. The specific aims are to: 1) Determine how M.tb exposure to
people living with HIV ALF (HIV-ALF) vs. control ALF generates early-stage M.tb metabolic adaptations that lead
to host cell immune dysregulation; 2) Determine how the combined effect of exposure of alveolar cells and M.tb
to HIV-ALF (vs. control ALF) causes dysfunctional alveolar immunity that accelerates M.tb growth and
dissemination using a lung-on-chip (LoC) model; and 3) Determine how infection of BAL-acquired AMs by HIV
or control ALF-exposed M.tb instilled in the airways alters the alveolar cellular immune response using the NHP
model. Results from this proposal will move science forward by guiding the scientific community on the
development of effective immune-based early interventions, specifically for people living with HIV."

Functional Piezo1 is enriched in the Schwann cells (SCs) of the peripheral nervous system; however, whether
SCs-Piezo1 contributes to pain pathology is generally unknown. The overall goal of this exploratory/innovative
proposal is to investigate the possible role of SCs-Piezo1 in pain sensation by adeno-associated virus (AAV)-
mediated selective SCs-Piezo1 inhibition in vivo. We 1) Verify physical and functional Piezo1 expression in SCs,
2) Verify that sciatic nerve injection of Piezo1 agonist Yoda1 induces hypersensitivity of mechanical response in
rats, which is reversed by co-injection of GsMTx4, a non-specific Piezo1 inhibitor, 3) Confirm a novel AAV capsid
(olig001) with primary Schwann cell tropism via intrasciatic delivery, 3) Optimized sciatic nerve injection
technique for successfully applying injecta into subepineural space avoiding severe injection injury, 4) Develop
a short hairpin Piezo1-shRNA (PZ1shRNA) that efficiently silences physical and functional Piezo1 expression,
and 5) Develop a potent Piezo1 inhibitory peptide aptamer (PZ1iPA) derived from the human Piezo1 protein.
These preliminary data support the feasibility of testing the hypothesis that AAVolig001-mediated selective
inhibition of Schwann cell Piezo1 will mitigate nerve injury-induced hypersensitivity in rat model of neuropathic
pain. To accomplish the goal, the following Specific Aims are proposed. Aim 1 will develop and produce the test-
AAVolig001s (AAVolig001-PZ1shRNA and AAVolig001-PZ1iPA) for selective Schwann cell transduction in vivo
and validate the efficacy of the test-AAVolig001s for physical/functional inhibition of SCs-Piezo1 in primary
cultured SCs. Aim 2 will determine the sensory biological effects after sciatic nerve delivery of the test-
AAVolig001s in naïve and neuropathic pain rats. Completion of these Aims will verify the role of SCs-Piezo1 in
pain sensation and lay a foundation to explore the physiology and pathophysiology of SCs-Piezo1 in future
studies."
10948832,"PROJECT SUMMARY The immediate objective of our proposal is to increase immune density within solid
malignancies to rectify defects in anti-tumor immunity and maximize response rates to immune checkpoint
blockade (ICB) therapy. An important hallmark of cancer is the ability to suppress or exclude innate and adaptive
antitumor immune subsets, resulting in a tumor microenvironment less conducive to ICB treatment. Studies using
combinatorial strategies have concluded that increased CD8 T cell density during immune checkpoint inhibition
significantly enhances anti-tumor efficacy in non-immunogenic “cold” tumors. To increase CD8 T cell infiltration,
we have developed a tumor-targeting bacterial platform engineered to secrete chemokines and cytokines, which
we refer to as biological beacons or “bio-beacons,” and are meant to recruit and activate select subsets of
immune cells. We have completed proof-of-principle experiments to show that bio-beacons, composed of tumor-
colonizing E.coli vectors secreting murine C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9) and interleukin-15 (IL-15),
mediate migration and expansion of murine lymphocytes. While cytotoxic CD8 T cells are thought to mediate the
majority of tumor cell killing during immune checkpoint inhibition, it is becoming increasingly clear that overall
efficacy of the anti-tumor response depends on a broader spectrum of cell types present within the tumor
microenvironment that provide support, such as CD4 T cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and natural killer (NK) cells.
Therefore, we propose to generate additional bio-beacons secreting murine CCL3 and CCL4, which are
anticipated to recruit a broader spectrum of immune cells including CD4, NK, DCs, and monocytes. We
hypothesize that bio-beacons will increase sensitivity of solid tumors to immunotherapy, specifically ICB
treatment, by increasing intratumoral density of tumor-reactive immune subsets. We propose to elucidate
changes in intratumoral immune composition following bio-beacon treatment and their potential synergy with
immune checkpoint blockade therapy as a prelude for clinical development and translation. A series of studies
under two Specific Aims will be conducted to: i) develop and evaluate novel bio-beacons intended to recruit
supportive immune subsets; ii) determine the changes in intratumoral immune composition mediated by single
or combinations of bio-beacons in various solid tumor models; and iii) determine bio-beacon combinations that
significantly enhance efficacy of ICB therapy in tumor-bearing mice. These studies will delineate the intratumoral
frequency and functional phenotype of immune subsets following bio-beacon administration, which can be used
to uncover potential mechanisms contributing to any observed improvements in ICB therapy. If successful, we
predict that bio-beacons can be used to increase the frequency of tumor-reactive immune subsets in a variety of
solid tumor types and, thus, increase sensitivity to ICB treatment. In future endeavors, we imagine leveraging
the ability of bio-beacons to recruit and expand T lymphocytes as a strategy to restrict the cytolytic activity of
cell-based therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, to solid tumors."
10951871,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Duke Center for AIDS Research (Overall)
The principal mission of the Duke Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) is to establish and grow comprehensive
infrastructure support for a research environment that will effectively promote collaboration, coordination, and
innovation throughout the Duke HIV/AIDS research community and across the national CFAR network. As
evidenced by the growth in our NIH-Funded Research Base that now qualifies us as a Tier 2 CFAR, this
competitive renewal application represents an evolution that builds upon our accomplishments and lessons
learned during the previous funding cycles, taking advantage of the synergies established among our Core
components. A solid basis is formed by our highly successful Pilot Grant mechanism, aimed primarily at Early
Stage Investigators, and our equally successful faculty recruitment efforts, both of which have facilitated
greater gender and racial diversity. The driving force behind all of our evolving support services is a highly
active and effective Strategic Planning process, led by our Executive Committee (EC), with valuable input from
both our advisory committees and our intramural Strategic Partners. This highly iterative process has identified
five Specific Aims to guide the CFAR's growth and evolution over the next 5 years: 1) Provide comprehensive
infrastructure support to all intramural HIV/AIDS investigators aimed at expanding the robust program of inter-
disciplinary, collaborative HIV research that addresses NIH Research priorities. 2) Continue development of a
pipeline of next generation HIV/AIDS investigators through strong support of Early Stage Investigators and
engagement of established investigators from outside the field of HIV/AIDS research. 3) Foster critical
synergies through Core-Core interactions and engagement of new and existing Strategic Partnerships. 4)
Expand the relevance, reach, and impact of HIV/AIDS research by implementing and supporting community
engagement and outreach. 5) Further enhance and support collaborative activities throughout the global
network of CFARs. Support services will be enhanced by increased institutional support from Duke's School of
Medicine and Department of Surgery. Through our Strategic Planning process, we have identified eight priority
areas that represent opportunities for further development during the next funding cycle. These include: 1) the
`Southern HIV Epidemic'; 2) HIV Co-Morbidities, Co-Infections, and Complications; 3) Latency and Eradication;
4) Health Disparities; 5) Vaccine Design and Evaluation; 6) Mental Health and Substance Abuse; 7) the HIV
Organ Policy Equity (HOPE) Act; and 8) Emerging Infections. Finally, to ensure the continued high-quality
support for intramural HIV/AIDS investigators, the EC has formulated a Leadership Transition Plan, vetted by
the institution, in which Dr. Georgia Tomaras and Dr. Susanna Naggie will become Director and Co-Director,
respectively. The CFAR looks forward to developing and exploring these timely opportunities within Duke and
across the CFAR network throughout the next funding cycle."

This P20 FORWARD Center will support a Project conceived and executed by three Early Stage Investigators
(ESIs) to address a problem that is important to the field of benign prostate research and to other fields more
broadly: the relevance of specific genetically engineered mouse models to human disease. The need for animal
models in biomedical research and the utility of mice, specifically, is well recognized and accepted. A number of
mouse models that purport to represent this disease have been generated. It is well recognized in the field that
none of these is a good overall representation of the human condition. As such, criticism of models is a common
issue in grant and paper review. This is a problem for all investigators in the field and can be particularly
damaging to ESIs who do not have resources to generate data from multiple lines. The Center will bring together
two biologists (Drs. Popovics and Vickman) with complementart skill sets and an interest in BPH, , contributing
expertise in mouse models and inflammation, with a bioinformatician (Dr. Lanman) to develop new approaches
to correlate transcriptomic data from mice with existing human BPH datasets to establish a reference dtabase
encompassing similarities and differences between individual mouse models and salient aspects of human
diseases. Successful development of these methods will allow broad application of the approach across a range
of diseases where such problems exist. The project will establish standards and benchmarks for comparing
mouse models to human BPH and identifying commonalities and disparities between the two. This will facilitate
the selection of the best models and will encourage similar characterization and comparison of other models in
the field. The data will be made available to the scientific community, as a collection in the CellxGene portal and
as an RShiny application. Consistent with the stated goals of the RFA the Administrative Core and its Director
(the PI, Dr. Hayward) will support the Project and specifically will provide access to resources and expertise to
assist the three ESIs in the development of new funding proposals derivative from the data generated here. The
Administrative Core will also oversee the fiscal and regulatory aspects of the Center and will provide mechanisms
for regular contacts between the Project investigators and the broader research community, in particular with
past and present CAIRIBU members, fostering opportunities to present data and furthering career opportunities.
The Adminstrative Core will also coordinate with experts in the field to support the development and submission
of new grant proposals from the ESIs. The immediate goal of this Center is to support the development of data
that will contribute to the career development and funding success of three early stage investigators in the field
of benign urologic research, bring new ideas and retain expertise in the field. The long-term goal is for the ESIs
to achieve significant independent careers."

Over the last several decades, developmental language scientists have sought to understand the effects of dual
language input on children’s vocabulary outcomes. Much of this work has been correlational and has focused
on static standardized measures of vocabulary size in typically developing bilingual children, excluding late
talkers – children with atypically small vocabularies. Yet, about 25% of bilingual 2-year-olds are late talkers
compared to only 10-15% of white monolingual cohorts. Although an important predictor of later outcomes,
vocabulary size reveals little about children’s semantic structure – how word meanings are represented,
organized, and connected. Computational and empirical studies in monolinguals suggest that children’s semantic
structure 1.) reflects the statistical regularities and semantic relationships in their language environments; and
2.) predicts word learning over and above vocabulary size. Critically, it remains unclear how children’s lexicons
reflect dual language input, and whether different semantic structures yield distinct adaptations to word learning
in dual language contexts. Therefore, the primary objective of this proposal is to examine interactions between
dual language input, semantic structure, and word learning in bilingual TD and LT toddlers. We will test 80
Spanish-English matched typical- and late-talking bilingual toddlers aged 24 – 30 months. In Aim 1, we will use
semantic network approaches to model children’s lexicons in both languages and characterize the relationship
between dual language input and children’s semantic structure. In Aim 2, we will examine the relationship
between semantic structure and statistical word learning in single and dual language contexts. We will also
analyze whether children’s semantic network properties in both languages modeled in Aim 1 predict word
learning performance across semantic and dual language experimental conditions. In Aim 3, we will analyze late-
talker status as a predictor and compare 40 typical talkers to 40 late talkers to examine whether the relationships
among dual language input, semantic structure, and word learning differ between groups. This career
development proposal includes an expert team of mentors from Psychology, Computer Science, Communication
Sciences and Disorders, Education and Public Health. The candidate will receive training in observational
methodology and parent-child interactions; experimental and eye-tracking methodology for toddlers; and network
science approaches. The long-term goals of this work and specialized training are to examine language
trajectories longitudinally in bilingual learners; and to develop novel clinician- and parent-mediated interventions
for bilingual children via behavior and network science approaches. The career goals align closely with the
strategic objectives of NIDCD, including to capitalize on advances in basic research to enhance our
understanding of normal function and disordered processes (Theme 1); to reduce the impact of health disparities
and inequities in communication disorders among racial/ethnic minorities (Theme 4); and to facilitate use of and
best practices in biomedical data science (Theme 5)."

Environmental microbes are affected by and evolve to succeed in the changing environments they inhabit. As
a result, changes in the environment can select for microbes that are more or less capable of causing human
infections. Cryptococcus is a genus of opportunistic fungal pathogens that cause approximately 200,000
deaths in HIV/AIDS individuals. Cryptococcus species grow in an environmental niche before causing
“accidental” infections of mammals with no known return to the environment after infection or spread between
hosts. Notably, the pathogens within the genus split from the nonpathogens approximately 100 million years
ago, concurrent with the development of the ability to grow at human body temperature. In the proposed work,
I will use the Cryptococcus genus to explore the genetic basis of two pathogenesis relevant traits that are
changing in the environment because of human activities, with an eye towards using Cryptococcus as a model
to understand how these changes in environment may alter other environmental fungi. Project 1 will focus on
the transition to thermotolerance that occurred in the Cryptococcus genus. Elevated global temperatures as a
result of climate change will likely select for environmental microbes that can grow at higher temperatures. I will
employ high-throughput genetics approaches (TN-seq) to characterize genome-wide contributions to growth at
various temperatures across the entire Cryptococcus genus, including both pathogens and nonpathogens. I
will then use allele swap experiments to explore effects of sequence variation, lineage-specific gene content,
and transcriptional reprogramming. Project 2 will focus on resistance to azole class drugs. Modern agricultural
practices employ large amounts of azole drugs to control fungal plant pathogens. Environmental fungi are also
commonly exposed to these drugs and thus are being selected for drug resistance. I will use a diploid complex
trait genetics approach (RH-seq) that is based on TN-seq to explore the basis of azole drug resistance in a
large (n=387) strain collection of environmental and clinical isolates from Africa. I will again use allele swap
experiments to validate drug resistance mutations and test the contribution of epistasis to antifungal drug
resistance. This work will reveal fundamental mechanisms underlying adaptation to high temperatures and
antifungal drugs. It will also generate mutant libraries across an entire genus and mapping populations for a
large number of C. neoformans isolates that can be used in future projects across the community. An
expanded understanding of heat tolerance and of drug resistance may aid in the development of novel
antifungal agents or more efficient use of the currently available drugs, leading to improved outcomes for
treatment of invasive fungal diseases. Finally, a better understanding of how human activities lead to changes
in environmental microbes can provide both predictions and potential guidance for intervention."

 Protein phosphorylation defines one of the most important and pervasive regulatory mechanisms in cell
signaling. A precise control of the balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is crucial for living
organisms to maintain normal physiological functions. While protein kinases have attracted a significant amount
of attention given the promise of developing inhibitors for targeted therapies, significant knowledge gaps exist
on the opposing actions of protein phosphatases. The overall objective of this study is to investigate the
molecular mechanisms by which PTPRF, a receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase, regulates Wnt signaling and
normal intestinal homeostasis. A large body of evidence indicates that Wnt signaling is required for the
maintenance of normal intestinal stem cells; and dysregulation of Wnt signaling is often the first step leading to
the development of colorectal cancer. In our efforts to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of Wnt signaling,
we identified PTPRF, a receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase, as a novel positive regulator in the Wnt pathway
that promotes the activation of Wnt signaling upstream of the β-catenin destruction complex. To further determine
the functional importance of PTPRF, we utilized Ptprf knockout mice to investigate if Ptprf-loss alters Wnt
signaling and the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells in vivo. Our exciting new data showed
that intestinal crypts isolated from Ptprf knockout mice have reduced ability to form organoids, which coincides
with decreased expression of Wnt target genes. In addition, we found that PTPRF interacts and co-localizes with
LRP6 and caveolin upon Wnt stimulation; and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of PTPRF in 293T cells
attenuates Wnt-stimulated TOP-Flash reporter activity as well as LRP6 phosphorylation. Moreover, we identified
NEDD4L as a novel E3 ligase that controls PTPRF ubiquitination and degradation. The following specific aims
are proposed: 1) to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying PTPRF-mediated regulation of Wnt
signaling; 2) to determine the role of NEDD4L in controlling PTPRF protein stability; and 3) to define the functional
importance of PTPRF in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells in vivo. Results
from our studies will fill an important knowledge gap on how protein phosphatases are involved in regulating
complex biological processes. This supplement will allow Ms. Haley Stanczyk to receive further training in
conducting basic research in cell signaling. Her results will assist in determining the role of PTPRF in regulating
Wnt signaling and intestinal stem cell functions. She will examine the molecular mechanisms by which PTPRF
regulates caveolin-mediated endocytosis of Wnt receptors. Moreover, she will investigate if loss of PTPRF
expression reduces the “stemness” of intestinal stem cells using organoid and mouse models. Ultimately, by
providing new insights into PTPRF-dependent regulation of Wnt signaling, our findings will help identify new
strategies for treating Wnt-driven diseases by using PTPRF as a target."

Kidney stone disease (nephrolithiasis) is characterized by painful, recurrent symptomatic events and is rising
disproportionately in youth. Structural and scientific barriers have impeded strengthening the evidence base for
management of pediatric kidney stone disease. The overarching objective of the Personalizing Outcomes of
Nephrolithiasis in Youth (PONY) P20 Center is to generate knowledge that improves outcomes for youth with
nephrolithiasis through an intentional and focused initiative to accelerate the research careers of early-stage
investigators and thereby enhance the benign urology research community. To achieve this mission, this
proposal strengthens partnerships among Dr. Gregory Tasian (PI at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Dr
Jonathan Ellison (early-stage investigator at Children’s Wisconsin), Dr. David Chu (early-stage investigator at
Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago), and Dr. Jing Huang (biostatistician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia).
In the proposed PONY P20 Center, we address critical structural and scientific barriers that have impeded
strengthening the evidence base for management of pediatric nephrolithiasis. We will accomplish our objectives
by leveraging the resources generated by Dr. Tasian’s research program, in particular the robust infrastructure
of the Pediatric KIDney Stone (PKIDS) Care Improvement Network and data generated by the NIDDK-supported
Urinary Stone Disease Research Network. Central to the PONY P20 Center is the PKIDS Care Improvement
Network, which will support the Research Project and provide the means to disseminate the knowledge
generated by the research directly into real-world care. In Aim 1, we will generate new knowledge responsive to
patient-identified gaps in kidney stone research by conducting two distinct but complementary research studies
that use data from PKIDS trial, the Prevention of Urinary Stones with Hydration (PUSH) trial, and the STudy to
Enhance uNderstanding of sTent-associated Symptoms (STENTS). In Aim 2, we will accelerate the research
careers of early-stage investigators in benign urology. The Administrative Core will create opportunities for Drs.
Ellison and Chu to lead the execution of the Research Project through operational and logistical support as well
as data access. PKIDS will also provide the scientific environment to support the R01 applications led by Drs.
Ellison and Chu that will arise from the Research Project. In Aim 3, the PONY P20 Center will enhance the
benign urology research community. We will share our expertise in stakeholder (particularly patient and
caregiver) engagement with members of CAIRIBU other benign urologic researchers. We will participate in
existing CAIRIBU forums by contributing our lessons learned on stakeholder engagement in clinical investigation,
patient-centered trial design, and conceptual innovations in learning health systems. Overall, the PONY P20
Center will generate knowledge that addresses critical priorities identified by youth with nephrolithiasis and
accelerates the career of early-stage investigators who will be leaders in benign urological research."

How external signals and stressors such as nutrition and diet act to regulate genetic diseases remains largely
unknown. With millions globally at risk of under and over nutrition, understanding how nutritional stress impacts
disease is of key importance. As early life diet is one of the first external inputs experienced both during gestation
and after birth, it is poised to play a critical role in shaping lifelong disease phenotypes. Sickle cell disease (SCD),
a genetic disease largely driven by one mutation shows significant variability in presentation and we hypothesize
that diet and nutritional stress may contribute to this. The largest global burden of mortality in children under five,
highlighting the importance of research on how early life exposures impact SCD severity. The immune system is
a fundamental player in the pathogenesis of SCD where neutrophils promote inflammation and vaso-occlusion.
Diet can regulate neutrophils, but it is unclear how early life exposures compare to those later in life. Using blood
samples from patients with SCD, we propose to evaluate the correlation between diet, disease severity, and
neutrophil activity. Using a mouse model of SCD, we will evaluate when and how dietary inputs modulate disease
severity and the contribution of neutrophils to this process. As such, we seek to investigate the intersection of
early life nutritional stress, neutrophils, and SCD with the intent to identify regulators of neutrophil function and
production that may serve as novel targets for SCD therapy.
In Aim 1, we investigate how early life nutritional stress impacts neutrophil development in the bone marrow and
neutrophil function. Our preliminary data suggest that exposure to high fat diet (HFD) early in life expands
neutrophils compared to later in life treatment. As such, we will assess neutrophil progenitors in the bone marrow
in response to different nutritional stressors. By comparing early life exposure compared to later in life exposure,
we will determine if there is a key window for setting lifelong neutrophil levels. We will also measure neutrophil
function in response to early life nutritional stress.
In Aim 2, we study how nutritional stress modulates neutrophil function in SCD by using a mouse model of SCD
and blood samples from patients with SCD. We assess neutrophil function in SCD mice experiencing early life
nutritional stress and determine effects on SCD severity. Subsequently, we will correlate neutrophil function in
adults and children with SCD with patient characteristics such as BMI and diet along with SCD disease severity.
Together, this proposal investigates the intersection of nutritional stress, neutrophils and SCD with the
goal of uncovering novel targets for therapeutics in neutrophil-mediated diseases, such as SCD."

High-potency cannabis use is associated with public health risks, such as cannabis use disorder, psychotic
disorders, and impaired cognition. Legal markets in the US and Canada are geared towards the
commercialization of high-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) products, including concentrates as high as 90-95%. The
cannabis industry has resisted regulation of higher-potency products claiming that cannabis consumers naturally
self-titrate their use, but the limited evidence to date suggests that even though consumers may use less
cannabis as potency rises, consuming higher potency products still leads to greater THC consumption.
We will use a randomized crossover trial to evaluate the ability of 36 regular cannabis consumers (18 females
and 18 males) to self-titrate the THC dose when vaping concentrates to achieve the desired psychoactive effects.
We will also characterize and compare the subjective, cognitive, physiological, and pharmacokinetic effects
between cannabis concentrates of different potencies (30%, 60%, and 90% THC). Working with US scientists,
the setting of this study will be Toronto, Canada, in the context of federal legalization of cannabis, unique access
to cannabis products not available in the US for research purposes, and an encouraging regulatory environment.
We will test commercial products that are representative of the THC ranges available in the legal market.
Aim 1: To evaluate the ability of regular cannabis consumers to self-titrate their THC dose when vaping
concentrates of different potencies. We will compare markers of titration (biological: THC blood levels;
behavioral: inhalation topography; subjective: self-reported levels of intoxication) over a range of potencies for a
comprehensive characterization of titration practice. We hypothesize that participants will be able to partially but
not proportionally reduce THC intake with increase in THC potency. In other words, we anticipate that the
proportional decrease in blood THC levels will be lower than the proportional increase in THC concentrations.
Aim 2: To compare the cognitive impairment, physiological effects, and addiction liability of consuming lower
versus higher THC potency concentrates. We hypothesize that cognitive impairment and physiological effects
will be less pronounced with lower-THC concentrates in a dose-response fashion. We will also explore
differences in addiction liability between potencies as higher THC concentrations may result in greater dysphoric
reactions. These acute effects may be related to long term harms such as accidents, CVD events, and CUD.
Exploratory Aim: To explore sex differences in titration efficiency, blood THC concentrations, cognitive
impairment, physiological effects, and addiction liability. We propose to analyze sex differences in our primary
and secondary outcomes (e.g., whether females will be able to titrate more efficiently than males).
This experimental evidence will provide data on the potential acute harms related to concentrates and inform
policy decisions on the need to decrease access and/or prevent their initiation and implement information and
education campaigns to increase awareness on the risks of using them."

Over one-half the population of childbearing age women are cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositive. More than
90% of CMV-seropositive women will shed the virus in their breast milk during the first month of lactation without
clinical signs of systemic infection. Postnatal cytomegalovirus (pCMV) infection occurs in 4-20% of preterm
infants, manifesting as a sepsis-like syndrome and respiratory decomposition. Developing novel strategies to
eliminate the risk of pCMV infection or adverse host responses to CMV+ human milk in preterm infants is a
critical step to maximize the safety of human milk delivery. The overall objectives of this study are to (1) test the
potential of an added CMV neutralizing antibody to minimize cellular infiltration and infection, and to (2)
characterize the human milk compositional differences in CMV+ versus CMV- milk and its impact on preterm
health outcomes. We will conduct two complimentary specific aims: (1) Evaluate the pharmacokinetics and
neutralizing efficacy of an anti-CMV antibody added to CMV+ milk. (2) Investigate the impact of mammary CMV
reactivation on the human milk lipidome and determine the impact of receiving CMV+ human milk on neonatal
outcomes. This proposal brings together leading experts in neonatology, neonatal nutrition, human milk
lipidomics, infectious disease, CMV, and vaccine development. Adding anti-CMV neutralizing antibodies in
CMV+ human milk has the potential to reduce the risk of postnatal CMV transmission in preterm infants who rely
on breast milk for optimal nutrition. In addition, human milk compositional changes will be identified that will
identify targets to mitigate the risk of lipidomic and inflammatory driven secondary disease outcomes related to
CMV reactivation in breast milk and serve as efficacy biomarkers for future intervention trials to interrupt human
milk CMV reactivation and infectivity."

The aim of phase I of the parent cooperative agreement (U44AA026126) was to generate
sufficient data on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicology (Tox) of JR-220 to support an

The aim of phase II of the parent cooperative agreement is to expand the phase I studies with rat
and a second species (canine) based upon the feedback of the FDA’s pre-IND meeting response
to create a dossier that will be submitted to the FDA in support of IND status for JR-220 as a
medication for treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Neither of these aims has changed from
the original funded application, but the cost to support several GLP/GMP tasks related to these
aims have significantly increased for reasons outside the control of the company. All of these
tasks support the potential value of JR-220 as a medication for AUD and are required for IND
submission. This administrative supplemental proposal is a request for additional funds to cover
the unanticipated increased cost of several key GLP/GMP tasks to be completed that are required
by the FDA to submit the IND application. This administrative supplement proposal includes tasks
previously proposed and accepted by reviewers and NIAAA. The three key tasks with increased
costs are 1) GLP CNS safety study (Neurotoxicity) in rat specifically requested by the FDA in the
pre-IND meeting response, 2) cGMP manufacturing of JR-220 (drug substance), and 3) cGMP
manufacturing of JR-220 capsules (drug product) for clinical trial. This administrative
supplemental request for additional funding under $100K to help cover the incremental
unanticipated cost increase from 2016 to completed these original scope tasks is important for
the successful completion of the overall goal of the parent cooperative agreement to submit the
IND in support of JR-220 as medication for treatment for AUD."

Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive, painful malignancy with a 5 year survival rate of less than 5% and median
survival of about 4 to 24 months. The overall lack of success of chemotherapy treatments underscores, at least
in part, the incomplete understanding of how pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) grows and invades local and
distant tissues. There continues to be novel discoveries with respect to genetic mutations that predispose
individuals to developing PDAC, histopathological features with prognostic implications, and clinical imaging
(functional metabolic and anatomic, e.g. PET/CT) that define clinical stage and guide treatment options.
However, overall, each diagnostic modality in large part, remain independent of one another. Consequently there
is a need to assess and integrate measurements from the cell, tissue, and organ levels with multiple imaging
modalities and to evaluate the concordance across different types of measurements and spatial scales in order
to characterize the “molecular omic-type to clinical phenotype” relationship. Linking measurements from these
different disciplines, radiology, pathology, and high-throughput molecular measurements, will help to establish
more definitive phenotypes of PDAC that are consistent across multiple spatial scales.
Recently many of the changes in PDAC have evolved around changes in the metabolic aspects of the tumor
microenvironment and the interactions between tumor cells and the surrounding stromal cells, thus we focus on
identifying metabolically driven/related phenotypes. We hypothesize that characterizing the PDAC
microenvironment tumor-stroma interface at the cell and tissue levels will enable assessment of glycolytic and
inflammatory characteristics of tumors in relation to specific histological tumor characteristics (e.g. perineural
invasion and lymphovascular invasion) and this will lead to 1) a non-invasive imaging test to identify PDAC
phenotypes and 2) new potential cellular targets for treatment. A data-driven systems biology approach using
transcription-signaling-metabolic network reconstructions and constraint-based modeling will be used as the tie
that binds a wide array of disparate data, including cellular microscopy, 3D preserved architecture tissue imaging,
and PET/CT imaging in order to define a non-invasive functional, metabolic phenotyping measurement of PDAC
that corresponds to cellular phenotypes. The constraint-based genome scale integrative modeling framework
allows the simultaneous analysis of multiple types of data in interacting populations of cells. Additionally through
the acquisition of multi-parametric cross- sectional imaging, it will be possible to evaluate whether or not
metabolic changes on the cellular level have any manifestations on the tissue level. The environment, team, and
resources assembled at UCLA are poised in a unique position to carry out these studies and achieve success
in developing a non-invasive imaging approach for phenotyping PDAC."

 In cardiovascular disease diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring, a plethora of deformable biointerface
devices are utilized. These devices are adept at gauging physiological metrics, administering bioelectrical
modulation, or dispensing therapeutics. Notwithstanding the advent of preclinical biotechnologies like
optogenetics and cell-based biological pacing, non-genetic electronic pacing persists as the predominant
therapeutic approach for cardiac rhythm anomalies. Recently, semiconductors have been identified as promising
instruments for non-genetic cardiovascular investigations. Our team is focusing on designing minimally invasive
photostimulation tools specifically tailored for cardiac pacing applications.
 We recently published several photoelectrochemical methods for optically modulating cardiac activity in
cultured cells and adult rodent models ex vivo. Using these methods, we can achieve light-activated modulation
of cardiac tissue with a light intensity comparable to that used in optogenetics. In this current work, Tian, Hibino,
Jia and Aziz will work together to expand and strengthen our newest photostimulation system, porosity-based
silicon heterojunctions, for multi-site, leadless, nongenetic, and optoelectronic modulation of cardiac tissues.
 Specifically, our team aims to design, fabricate, and evaluate a range of porosity-based heterojunctions
tailored for optical modulation of cardiac tissues. We will synthesize silicon membranes with non-
porous/nanoporous heterojunctions and three-dimensional surface topographies. To enhance the stability of
these heterojunctions and modulate their longevity under physiological conditions, we will employ atomic layer
deposition to passivate the silicon interfaces. We plan to modify the surface with metal or metal-oxide catalysts
to bolster signal transduction. To support the silicon heterojunctions, we will integrate soft matrices, including
polymers and hydrogels, enhancing both biocompatibility and signal transduction at biointerfaces. Concurrently,
we will produce biocompatible, stretchable optical fibers tailored for in vivo photostimulation. Our team is also
developing a catheter-analogous minimally invasive photostimulation tool. For multi-site optical pacing, we will
engineer and assess the requisite software, mechanical, electrical, and optical subsystems. We will validate the
performance metrics of our random access photostimulation tools, including accuracy, scanning velocity, and
power delivery, followed by ex vivo photostimulation trials. In vivo biocompatibility assessments will be conducted
in a rat model, while we will gauge heart pacing efficacy in acute and chronic scenarios using single-chamber,
dual-chamber, and multi-site stimulations in a pig model. We will test our hypothesis that deformable and
biocompatible heterojunction devices can be used for multi-site cardiac resynchronization therapy. The new
designs for semiconductor-based biointerfaces will allow for minimally-invasive, wireless, nongenetic, multiscale,
and random access photostimulation."
10947329,"Project Summary
 The proposed project addresses the critical need for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer (PCa),
a second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men in the United States. Prostate-Specific
Membrane Antigen (PSMA) is highly expressed on PCa cells. Targeting PSMA is used clinically for imaging
and radio-ligand therapy. Despite advances in cancer care, treatment options for advanced PCa patients
remain limited due to challenges associated with effective and selective drug delivery to PCa cells. Combining
PSMA targeting with nanotechnology-based approach, we propose to develop novel systemic PSMA-targeted
glycodendrimer nanoplatforms (TgDNs) capable of selective intracellular delivery of high payloads of potent
chemotherapeutics to tumor cells, also enabling combination therapies through multifunctional surface of
dendrimers. Our prior research on hydroxyl dendrimers showed the potential of targeted intracellular delivery,
with early clinical promise. This new TgDN technology is designed to simultaneously achieve selective
targeting of high payloads to PCa cells with reduced side-effects, low immunogenicity, in vivo stability, water
solubility, ease of scalability, and flexibility in single or multiple drugs delivery.
 We will use Cabozantinib (Cab), a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor as a proof of concept. Cab is approved
for renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma in USA and Europe, but its PCa clinical trial was
terminated due to its negative side effects at a tolerated dose. TgDN-based targeted delivery of Cab selectively
to PCa cells can be highly beneficial to enhance its efficacy and reduce off-target toxicity. We will achieve our
goals through the following aims. 1) We will synthesize TgDNs with variable PSMA ligand loading and
determine their in vitro cancer targeting in PCa patient-derived xenograft (PDX) primary cultures, organoids
and PSMA+ PCa cells. 2) We will synthesize PSMA targeted TgDN-Cab conjugate; investigate the maximum
tolerable dose in healthy mice, in vivo efficacy in PCa PDX animal model; and evaluate potential off-target
cytotoxicity.
 Our long-term objective is to develop scalable, systemic dendrimer-drugs chemotherapies with
improved efficacy and reduced systemic side-effects that can be used not only for PCa but other cancers as
well. Our team has a significant experience in synthesis, in vivo studies, and clinical translation of dendrimer
nanomedicines. If successful, our technology shall fill in the long-standing technology gap for the treatment of
PCa and provide an urgently needed efficient, economic, and safe drug delivery for clinical translation."
10949018,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this project is to identify the role of the gut microbiome in the etiology of benign breast disease
(BBD), and thereby shed light on its pathogenesis in relation to breast cancer. Approximately one out of every
five women in the United States has been diagnosed with BBD, a well-established risk indicator for breast cancer.
BBD share the hormonal-related risk factors with breast cancer. However, the underlying mechanisms linking
hormone factors and breast disease are not clear. Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiome may be
significantly involved in breast disease through the influence on systemic estrogen homeostasis. This evidence
supports the hypothesis that the gut microbiome is a key player in breast disease, and it may mediate the
associations between hormonal risk factors and BBD. However, no study has systematically studied the role of
the gut microbiome and its metabolome on BBD. Dr. Wang proposes to be the first to test this important
hypothesis. She will leverage the sub-studies embedded in the well-characterized Nurses’ Health Study II, to
test the three specific aims. In Aim 1 (K99), she will identify potential differences in gut microbial composition
and functional variation by various hormonal factors among ~1800 participants. In Aim 2 (R00), she will
characterize the associations between gut microbiome composition and the high-risk, proliferative subtype of
BBD in a nested case-control study (N=300) with breast biopsy sample collection. In Aim 3 (R00), she will
incorporate the functional readout of gut microbiome, the fecal metabolomics, to estimate the associations
between microbial metabolomic signatures and BBD in the same nested case-control study. Innovative shotgun
metagenomic sequencing and semi-targeted metabolomics will be used to discover microbial strains and their
metabolites. By integrating metagenomics and metabolomics, she will comprehensively investigate taxonomic
composition and functional potential of gut microbial communities that are directly involved in BBD, as well as
the potential mediating role of the gut microbiome underlying the hormonal factors-BBD associations. Results
from the proposed study may pave the way for novel personalized BBD and breast cancer prevention for high-
risk women defined by their hormonal profiles, with the potential modulation of gut microbiome. Dr. Wang’s
research aims are supported by a well-rounded training plan tailored to her two training goals: 1) Obtain training
and apply advanced bioinformatic analytics to large microbiome metagenomic and metabolomics datasets; and
2) Develop advanced knowledge on hormonal determinants on BBD epidemiology, etiology, pathology, and
pathogenesis as it relates to breast cancer. The training environment at Brigham and Women’s Hospital fosters
productivity and collaboration with world class biomedical scientists, and she have assembled a multidisciplinary
mentoring team that includes leading experts in BBD, human microbiome, bioinformatics, hormonal factors,
breast pathology, and breast cancer epidemiology. This K99/R00 award will help her gain the knowledge and
experience necessary to effectively pursue her career as an independent breast cancer investigator."
10949022,"Project Summary/ Abstract
The overarching goal of this project is to examine how socio-structural determinants of health impact the breast
tumor DNA methylome, activation of oncogenic signaling and ultimately, the racially disparate development of
triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). The etiologic basis of racial disparities in TNBC is not well understood
and few studies have investigated the impact of social determinants of health as potential drivers of disparities.
Recent work from the McCullough group shows that, in Atlanta, Black women with breast cancer are more
likely to live in redlined neighborhoods than White women (80% vs 20%) and that living in areas with high rates
of redlining is associated with a 60% increase in breast cancer mortality. These data support the need to
investigate redlining as an etiologic driver of race disparities in TNBC. We posit that to achieve health equity, it
is necessary to understand how socio-structural inequities can be adversely manifested biologically, resulting
in breast cancer. The goal of this study is to elucidate a biological mechanism that explains the association
between neighborhood-level redlining and disparities in TNBC. This investigation requires a researcher with a
diverse skillset that can address questions from the population to the bench. This Pathway to Independence
Award (K99/R00) application by Dr. Miller-Kleinhenz intends to uniquely position her to answer these questions
by building on her prior expertise in breast tumor biology and expanding her skill set in social and molecular
epidemiology and epigenetics. To achieve the aims of this research, Dr. Miller-Kleinhenz will focus her training
in three areas, (1) increasing knowledge through a comprehensive didactic curriculum, (2) experiencing and
learning from varied research environments, and (3) fostering professional development through leadership,
scientific communication, and then transitioning to independence. These training goals will be supervised by an
interdisciplinary mentoring team, led by Dr. Lauren McCullough, a cancer health disparities and molecular
epidemiology expert and an Assistant Professor of Epidemiology at Rollins School of Public Health at Emory
University. The co-mentor will be Dr. Adam Marcus, an expert cancer biologist and a Professor of Hematology
and Oncology and the Interim Executive Director of the Winship Cancer Institute. This training will aid Dr.
Miller-Kleinhenz to pursue the following aims during the K99 phase: Understanding the impact of redlining as a
social-structural determinant of health that is associated with TNBC development (Aim 1) and examining
redlining-associated DNA methylation signatures of the breast tumor epigenome in TNBC (Aim 2). During the
R00 phase, she will determine the pathobiological significance of redlining-associated expression of oncogenic
signaling pathways in TNBC (Aim 3). This 5-year research and training plan will allow Dr. Miller-Kleinhenz to
establish an independent research program that will elucidate new avenues for policy interventions and
pharmacological treatments that would contribute to the ultimate goal of reducing cancer health disparities."
10949025,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Asian Americans (AAs) are the fastest growing minority group in the U.S., and cancer is the leading cause of
death among this group. Although AA who are diagnosed with cancer commonly report fear, distress, and
depression, they have been found to utilize mental health services at lower rates than other groups and this
may be due to a dearth of culturally-competent services. Prior research on these cancer patients’ lives has
focused on barriers associated with health literacy and language proficiency but has ignored unique culture-
related challenges that contribute to their poor emotional outcomes. AAs are members of collectivist cultures
who view themselves as connected, relational, and belonging to a larger social group. Following changes in
physical function and social roles and responsibilities (e.g., job loss) after a cancer diagnosis, individuals may
self-perceive that they are a burden on their family members/caregivers. Therefore, the overarching goal of the
current proposal is to reduce the burden AA patients may feel they are on their caregivers by designing and
testing the feasibility of two positive activity interventions. We expect that contributing to one’s household and
outside one’s home will increase health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in AA cancer patients by increasing a
sense of relatedness, autonomy, and competence (mediators). In the K99 phase, 30 AAs ages 25-70 and
within 1 year of any cancer diagnosis will engage in either: 1) household contribution; 2) outside contribution;
or 3) control activities. Quantitative and qualitative (e.g., semi-structured interview, project personnel work logs)
data about the successful elements of the interventions will be collected. In collaboration with the mentorship
team, AA community members, and clinicians, a prototype of one or both positive activity interventions
(household or outside contribution) will be developed for AA cancer patients. In the R00 phase, 118 patients
(same inclusion criteria as K99 phase) will be randomized to either the contribution or control group. They will
engage in the positive or control activity once per week for 3 months, and outcomes and mediators will be
assessed at baseline, 1.5 months (midpoint), 3 months (post-test), and 6 months (follow-up). The trial will: 1)
assess the feasibility and acceptability of the household and outside contribution positive activities, 2) develop
a prototype of a positive activity intervention (household or outside contribution) for AA cancer patients, 3)
assess changes in HRQOL comparing intervention to control patients, and 4) assess mediators of the
intervention effects. This proposal introduces a novel, low cost, not stigmatizing, easy to implement, and highly
scalable approach not previously tested in AA cancer patients: engaging in positive activities. If found to be
successful, this framework for understanding patient-caregiver relationships in AAs can be used to develop
other positive activities that will improve and extend the lives of cancer patients from other collectivist cultures.
The proposed training plan will be critical in expediting the candidate’s transition into an independent
investigator with focused expertise in developing positive activities to eliminate cancer care disparities in AAs."
10947084,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD), the cause of low back pain (LBP), has been
connected to a substantial socioeconomic burden, pain, and loss of function for most adults (84% globally). The
significant prevalence of LBP in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa has compelled this study. The dysregulation of
nucleus pulposus cells, the backbone's shock absorbers, and the extracellular matrix (ECM), its supporting net-
work, dictates the disease progression. A type of planned cell death known as pyroptosis causes the release of
specific proteins that harm the cell and its structures. In IVDD, pyroptosis accelerates cellular support system
deterioration, which induces the illness. Pyroptosis may alter IVDD progression, but its exact mechanism is un-
clear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) molecules assist the cells in controlling the kinds and amounts of proteins produced.
miRNAs are essential for cell formation, function, and pyroptosis regulation. The IVDD rat model is appropriate
for studying the cause and treatment intervention in LBP since rats have a comparable structure and content to
human discs. Fine needle piercing is preferred for developing IVDD models due to its simplicity, convenience,
and high repeatability. Our team has examined miRNA’s safety and effectiveness in various aging and develop-
mental conditions. However, in rat models, the impact of miR27a-3p on pyroptosis-mediated routes on spine
disc cells and how it works are unknown. The rationale and central hypothesis for this project is that gene therapy
(miR27a-3p) mitigates the impacts of pyroptosis proteins on ECM composition, disc cell viability, and functions
in the annular puncture rat model of IVDD.
In Aim 1, the research team will utilize the annular puncture rat model to investigate if IVDD activates pyroptosis
proteins, influencing disc structure, function, and cellular integrity at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Aim 2 will explore if
inhibiting caspase-1 preserves ECM components, disc cell viability, and functions in the annular punctured rat
model of IVDD at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. In Aim 3, the team will scrutinize if AAV6.miR27a-3p restores cell viability
and functionality via CASP1/NLRP3 pathways in an annular puncture model of IVDD in rats at 4, 8, and 12
weeks. With the guidance of an exceptional mentorship team, the K43 candidate, Dr. Ogunlade, will acquire
knowledge and training in 1) advanced biomedical courses, 2) research methodology and design, 3) data man-
agement and analysis, and 4) manuscript writing and grantsmanship. These training goals will facilitate Dr.
Ogunlade’s long-term goal to become an independent biomedical scientist focused on translational research
using gene therapy intervention for LBP, build a collaborative network across different disciplines, and ultimately
assemble his own research team/group. This K43 proposal will provide preliminary data and the expertise
needed to design a more extensive interventional study relating to low back pain caused by IVDD rampaging
among Nigerians and, by extension, to the African continent using gene therapy intervention.

10947341,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer affecting people with a cervix worldwide, after breast,
colorectal, and lung cancers, with 569,847 new cases every year. In the United States, cervical cancer incidence
and mortality are 7.7 and 2.3 per 100,000 women, respectively, with substantial disparities in both cervical cancer
incidence and mortality across racial and ethnic groups. Latinas, in particular, are disproportionately burdened
with cervical cancer compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHW), with incidence and mortality rates 50% higher
than NHWs. Among women diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer, Latinas are more likely than NHWs to be
diagnosed at an advanced stage, when there are fewer treatment options. Despite the average age of diagnosis
of all cervical cancers occurring around age 50, the majority of screening interventions focus on younger and/or
reproductive aged people with a cervix. Thus, there is growing urgency for improving cervical cancer prevention
among middle to older age women nationally and internationally. In the U.S., middle to older age immigrant
Latinas are disproportionately likely to be served at settings like Community Health Centers (CHCs). In 2017,
56% of poor and foreign-born Latina/os lived within two miles of a CHC. CHCs provide critical infrastructure and
offer healthcare to historically underserved populations (e.g., those without insurance). Evidence also suggests
that there are fewer racial/ethnic healthcare disparities among patients served by CHCs, underscoring the
importance of studying and understanding the care delivered in these settings. Therefore, the goals of the
proposed research, as part of a career development award, are to (1) describe cervical cancer screening rates
in a 23-state network of CHCs from 2012 to 2023 among middle to older age Mexican immigrants; (2) examine
individual, organizational, and structural level facilitators and barriers to cervical cancer screening among middle
to older age Mexican immigrants in three CHCs located in the Pacific northwest; and (3) co-develop a multi-level
intervention to improve cervical cancer screening among middle to older age Mexican immigrants in CHCs. This
career development award will establish Dr. Vasquez Guzman as a multi-disciplinary investigator focused on
implementing and disseminating novel primary care multi-level interventions that target complex, underserved
patient populations to reduce disparities in ongoing and regular timely and high-quality cervical cancer prevention
and screening services in safety-net settings. The K01 award provides mentored training for Dr. Vasquez
Guzman to develop expertise in 4 areas: (1) team science and the integration of social science and clinical
research approaches; (2) skills and knowledge in both intervention and implementation science (3) cervical
cancer screening and cancer communication skills; and (4) expand community engaged expertise. To achieve
these goals, Dr. Vasquez Guzman has assembled a well-funded and established mentoring team with expertise
in health services research, primary care, intervention design and implementation science, team science, and
CBPR, all of whom have success in mentoring faculty to research independence."

The aging of the population in industrialized nations is increasing the number of ischemic strokes that present in
the emergency rooms of hospitals. In the ischemic stroke neurons die rapidly (estimated at 1 million neurons per
minute) prompting the need for rapid triage and treatment to open the blocked blood vessel. We have previously
established that the exact rate at which neurons die and size of the infarction grows is highly variable among
patients and depends strongly on the degree of leptomeningeal arterial collateralization. The goal of this proposal
is to test a new biopharmaceutical agent (Sanguinate®) that is designed to boost the collateralization in ischemic
stroke as well as deliver and release oxygen locally in tissue with low oxygen tension. We believe that this
approach will reduce infarct volume in all strokes and reduce reperfusion injury in those successfully recanalized
by during interventional procedures. Sanguinate® is an investigational bio-pharmaceutical blood substitute that
facilitates the transfer of oxygen to oxygen-deprived cells and tissues. Sanguinate’s unique oxygen-delivery
system has the potential to treat hypoxia/ischemia. Sanguinate® is purified bovine hemoglobin that has been
pegylated and combined with carbon monoxide to suppress vasoconstriction and provide anti-inflammatory
effects. The bovine hemoglobin then carries oxygen for targeted release to areas with a low partial pressure of
oxygen (ischemic tissue). It has been shown to successfully address detrimental vasoconstrictive side effects
associated with older generation artificial blood products, but the effect on tissue perfusion, infarct volumes,
infarct growth and tissue hypoxia and have not been directly measured. The rationale for this work is that brain
infarcts grow rapidly if a blood vessel feeding the brain is blocked and even with the most efficient triage and
shortest door-to-needle time, millions of neurons will die. There is an unmet need for an easy, safe i.v. infusion
that can stop to growth of an infract and unlike thrombolytic agents, be safely administered to all patients as soon
as symptoms arise. We will establish the effectiveness of a new pharmaceutical that can be easily deployed in
emergency rooms, ambulances and satellite hospitals prior to transfer to a stroke center comparing doses and
time-to-treatment effect with serial imaging a biomarkers of brain damage and inflammation in a controlled model
of ischemic stroke. Our findings will elucidate the mechanism of action of the agent and inform the design of
future human clinical trials."
10944600,"Project Summary/Abstract
Glaucoma is a multifactorial disease affecting millions worldwide, leading to substantial visual impairment and
blindness. The lack of reliable tools to predict disease risk and progression has resulted in preventable vision
loss and inefficient use of medical resources. In recent years, polygenic risk scores (PRS), which quantify the
cumulative risk of disease based on multiple genetic variants, offer a promising approach for personalized risk
prediction. However, the performance of these scores remains moderate at best limiting their clinical use. This
project aims to improve PRS performance using a multipronged approach combining innovative genomics and
computational strategies, thereby improving individualized glaucoma risk assessment and prognostication. We
will achieve this goal through the following the following 3 specific aims: 1) Improve PRS Performance through
Enhanced EHR-Based Disease Phenotyping: leveraging cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques and data from 68000+ patients across two clinical centers, we will train models to extract refined
glaucoma phenotypes from unstructured EHR data and demonstrate improved performance compared to
traditional ICD-based phenotyping. Results from genome-wide association study (GWAS) of our NLP
phenotypes from over 1 million participants across two biobanks will be used to develop improved PRS for
glaucoma. 2) Utilize ML-Derived Structural Phenotypes to Enhance PRS Performance: by conducting GWAS
on our previously developed machine learning-derived Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) glaucoma
phenotypes from 3 biobanks including 53000+ subjects, we will pinpoint novel genetic variants and integrate
these variants with previously known variants to create PRS with improved performance. 3) Improve PRS
performance by Constructing Subtype and Pathway-Specific PRS Models: with genomic data from 312,944 All
of Us participants, we will develop specialized PRS models for open-angle glaucoma subtypes as well as
pathway-specific scores based on relevant biologic pathways. These models, informed by previous GWAS
results, will enhance our understanding of glaucoma's complex genetic risk, and better predict disease severity,
trajectory, and treatment response. The culmination of these innovative methodologies seeks to transform
glaucoma care, promoting precision in early detection and tailored management. This interdisciplinary
approach, merging computational expertise with robust genomic insights, holds promise to set new standards
in ophthalmologic precision medicine."

Despite the recognized and urgent need for public health interventions that interrupt outdoor malaria
transmission, no such proven interventions are available. Transfluthrin-treated hessian fabric strips (TTHFS)
offer promise, showing more than six months of mosquito bite deterrence in Tanzanian settings. This project
seeks to clarify and advance the evidence base on TTHFS through meta-analysis of Tanzanian studies, semi-
field and field testing in Thailand and Cambodia, and user acceptability studies in Cambodia to inform future
studies and intervention designs.
Aim 1: To determine the relationship between TTHFS characteristics and their protective efficacy over
time in Tanzania. I hypothesize that an optimal transfluthrin concentration, fabric strip size, and temperature
range for TTHFS can be identified from prior studies in Tanzania, and that impacts on efficacy caused by high
temperature and relative humidity can be quantified.
Aim 2: To investigate the protective efficacy of TTHFS over time in Thai and Cambodian outdoor
conditions. I hypothesize that TTHFS that are efficacious in Tanzania will show similar levels of efficacy in a
very different setting against Thai and Cambodian malaria vectors, with similar effects of temperature and
humidity on the duration of efficacy.
Aim 3: To establish user acceptability and identify modifiable barriers to TTHFS uptake among
Cambodian forest rangers and forest goers. I hypothesize that Cambodian forest rangers and forest goers
will find TTHFS acceptable due to their ability to reduce mosquito bites, but will be uncomfortable with the
product given their limited experience with TTHFS and will have preferences on the size, shape, and design of
TTHFS.
This study will inform a future interventional study of an optimized TTHFS in Southeast Asia, to be performed
subsequent to this K01 study."
10948597,"During gestation, the uterine vasculature undergoes numerous physiologic modifications in order to bring the
necessary quantitative increase in blood flow to support placental development. The spiral arteries are
remodeled from tightly coiled, tonically active vessels to wide-bore tubes that lack responsiveness to maternal
tonic signals. Also, the larger vessels (uterine, arcuate, and radial arteries) dilate to increase the amount of
blood supplying the uterus. Preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction are two principal complications of
pregnancy. These diseases are related to chronic uteroplacental hypoperfusion, but knowledge of the
pathophysiological mechanisms involved remains inadequate. During uteroplacental vascularization, the most
prominent and important process is the spiral arteries remodeling. The spiral arteries undergo a generalized,
but non-uniform, dilation as pregnancy advances, with considerable variation in size between arteries within the
same specimen, and even at different points along individual arteries. The remodeling enables a continuous
high volume of maternal blood flow through the placenta after onset of the circulation, but presumably at a low
velocity and pressure that avoids mechanical damage to the villous trees and allows an adequate transit time for
maternal-fetal exchange. Despite the importance of uteroplacental vascularization in maternal-fetal health, there
is a paucity of safe and noninvasive imaging tools to assess it in real-time. To date, ultrasound Doppler
techniques are most commonly utilized to demonstrate and quantify blood flow during the uteroplacental
vascularization. However, Doppler indices show variability due to operator and system settings. Moreover,
Doppler signals from low velocity microvessels are often missed or misinterpreted. Thus, we propose a new
imaging tool to assess placental hemodynamics based on the pressure estimation using contrast-enhanced
ultrasound (CEUS). CEUS uses microbubbles, whose main purpose is to enhance the backscattered signals in
blood vessels allowing improved vascularity assessment by ultrasound imaging. However, microbubbles can
also act as pressure sensors, due to the difference in compressibility between the bubble and the surrounding
medium. Our group has developed the fundamental concept of subharmonic (half of fundamental frequency)
aided pressure estimation (SHAPE) using this oscillating characteristic of microbubbles. The SHAPE technique
estimates ambient pressure using the subharmonic amplitude from CEUS through this inverse relationship
measured at each target location in real-time. This study aims to determine if the SHAPE can become a safe,
noninvasive, and real-time tool to assess human uteroplacental vascularization in early pregnancy. We suggest
using mean pressure gradients between the uterine artery, placental bed (arteries in decidua and myometrium),
and intervillous space as our functional indices as well as the standard deviation of pressure estimates in the
placental bed. We hypothesize that these indices will correlate with the degree of uteroplacental vascularization,
i.e., with gestational age in normal pregnancy."
10947722,"The rigor and reproducibility of research relies on the appropriate use of statistical methods, in addition to the careful planning and designing of studies to answer research questions and make meaningful inferences based on data. While statistical methodology is widely used and disseminated in all areas of research, it is often misused due to lack of knowledge and training in statistical concepts and inadequate planning strategies. The field of neuroscience in particular has been criticized for overall poor study planning and misuse of statistical methodology, specifically related to inadequate sample size and power to detect clinically meaningful effects, as well as inattention to fundamental statistical assumptions. Although true for all disciplines, it is particularly important to encourage collaboration and team science in the field of neuroscience to not only offer a larger scope of perspectives and expertise, but also to result in improvements in the rigor and reproducibility of the resulting research. In partnership with CENTER, the team of collaborative biostatisticians, epidemiologists, and data scientists at Virginia Tech’s Center for Biostatistics and Health Data Science (CBHDS) will develop, evaluate, and disseminate a series of educational units in rigorous and reproducible approaches to study planning and design within a team science framework, including: 1) creating a formal plan for experimental design, execution and analysis; 2) exercising a sound process for choosing appropriate descriptive statistics; and 3) identifying assumptions and sources of error. The proposed educational units will be adaptable across various disciplines, formats, levels of learners, learning environments, and diverse backgrounds and perspectives."
10948425,"Sepsis is a major driver of broad-spectrum antibiotic use, in large part because best practice guidelines and
quality measures recommend immediate administration of antimicrobial therapy broad enough to cover all
likely pathogens for patients with suspected sepsis. This leads to many patients receiving antibiotics covering
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative organisms,
despite only a tiny fraction having evidence of these infections. Overly broad antibiotics contribute to antibiotic
resistance and increase the risk of acute kidney injury, Clostridioides difficile infection, and potentially even
mortality. Clear guidance on when to choose empiric narrow spectrum therapy has been lacking, however, in
large part because simple models predicting the risk of MDR pathogens have not shown high enough accuracy
to enable clinicians to safely withhold broad-spectrum therapy. Phenotyping studies that have attempted to
elucidate subtypes of sepsis by applying clustering methods to detailed electronic health record (EHR) data
have shown promise in predicting responses to varying treatment strategies, but none so far have sought to
inform the appropriate initial breadth of antibiotic therapy. Previous studies have also ignored key data
available in clinical notes, including presenting symptoms and recent antibiotic and healthcare exposures, even
though those data may be associated with the likelihood of MDR infection. My central hypothesis is that
objective EHR data can be augmented with key information extracted from unstructured free text notes using
large language models (LLMs) to define phenotypes of suspected sepsis that predict the value of initial anti-
MRSA and anti MDR Gram-negative therapy. I will investigate this in a large multihospital cohort through the
following specific aims: (1) Apply LLMs to clinical notes to identify presenting syndromes, recent antibiotic
exposures, and recent healthcare exposures in patients with suspected sepsis, and assess the marginal value
of these free-text data vs structured data alone to predict antibiotic choice and appropriateness; (2) Quantify
the impact of overly broad vs appropriate vs overly narrow antibiotics on patient outcomes in patients with
culture-positive sepsis; and (3) Identify phenotypes of suspected sepsis for whom the negative impact of overly
broad early antibiotic coverage most likely outweighs therapeutic benefit. The candidate, Dr. Theodore Pak,
MD, PhD, is an infectious diseases fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital and a physician-scientist with
experience in software engineering, bioinformatics, and analysis of EHR data. Dr. Pak’s goals during the K08
period are to obtain advanced training in EHR data analysis; learn advanced causal inference and machine
learning methods; gain experience in artificial intelligence and natural language processing of clinical text; and
strengthen abilities in scientific communication and leadership. By the end of the award period, Dr. Pak will be
poised to become an independent physician-scientist who designs, engineers, and leads analyses of “big data”
from health systems that address clinically impactful questions in infectious diseases."
10952697,"ABSTRACT
To understand speech, the human brain must parse and transform a noisy acoustic signal into meaningful
linguistic content, including phonemes, syllables, words, and sentences. This involves determining the timing of
important acoustic events, such as the onset of a sentence or a phrase. Following detection of these onsets,
the content of the sentence must be determined. The posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG)—including the
classic “Wernicke’s area”—is critical to this process, but until recently, little was known about its functional
organization, and in particular how this functional organization changes throughout development. Our recent
work showed that a spatially discrete region of the pSTG is critical for indicating when a sentence or phrase
begins. This region is distinct spatially and functionally from more anterior “sustained” areas that encode
phonetic feature information throughout a sentence. Functionally, both posterior onset and anterior sustained
regions show short and long temporal integration times, respectively, suggesting complimentary roles in
natural speech processing. Here, we propose an innovative approach using rare datasets where neural activity
is recorded directly from the human auditory cortex and speech-related areas in pediatric patient participants
undergoing clinical evaluation for epilepsy surgery. This method overcomes the spatial and temporal resolution
limitations of other noninvasive procedures, and provides a rare window into the function of the human auditory
cortex. The proposed study will use high resolution intracranial recordings to investigate how the brain detects
acoustic onsets in natural speech sound mixtures, and how neurophysiological responses to these sounds
change from early childhood to adolescence. Furthermore, we will investigate how these responses to onsets
are modulated by context, including during attention and for self-generated sounds. In addition to providing
insight into the basic functional organization of the human auditory cortex and cortical mechanisms for auditory
scene analysis, this research has important implications for the development of a speech brain computer
interface. Our results could also inform how speech and language are processed in natural contexts, which has
implications for the treatment of developmental language disorders, auditory processing disorder, dyslexia,
autism, and aphasia."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with an estimated 6.5 million patients aged 65
and older being affected in the US. Current FDA-approved therapies for AD include anti-amyloid antibody
infusion therapy to delay disease onset or cholinesterase inhibitors and glutamate regulators to treat cognitive
symptoms. However, these treatment options carry severe side effects and are not effective at stabilizing
cognitive symptoms or curing the disease. Collectively, these observations underscore an unmet medical need
for novel targets that allow for efficacious eradication of the neurodegenerative features and symptoms related
to AD. Interestingly, AD patients are known to also suffer from deficits in somatosensory perception, including
our sense of gentle touch. However, these deficits are postulated to be masked by the severe cognitive
dysfunction observed in the AD brain. Nevertheless, our sense of gentle touch enables numerous behaviors
fundamental to human existence, allowing us to eat, communicate and survive and is encoded by cutaneous
Merkel cells, a mature neuroendocrine lineage of mechanoreceptors that are innervated by slowly adapting
type I afferents. The overarching goal of our active R01AG073874 grant is to define the cellular and molecular
basis for maintenance of the Merkel lineage in the adult skin and leverages key preliminary data from our
laboratory that comprehensively chronicles a dramatic decline in Merkel cell numbers and tactile acuity in
human and murine skin across the lifespan. Since aging is a risk factor for AD onset and deficits in tactile
acuity, and somatosensory deficits, including loss of gentle touch, are a reported co-morbidity in AD patients,
we postulated that convergent mechanisms may govern these pathologies in the central nervous system (AD)
and the periphery (Merkel cells). In support of this idea, our new preliminary data shows i) highly accelerated
loss of cutaneous Merkel cells in four-month-old 5XFAD transgenic mice, a widely utilized mouse model of AD,
and ii) expression enrichment for two AD-associated proteins, App and Psen1, in epithelial progenitors for the
Merkel lineage. Collectively, these observations raise the hypothesis that AD-related mutations harbored in
5XFAD mice may also be relevant for Merkel cell stability. We will test this hypothesis with a comprehensive
assessment of the impact of AD mutations on Merkel cell numbers and epithelial progenitor function in the
skin. Our preliminary data also highlight the need to leverage 5XFAD mice to identify putative convergent
mechanisms of disease etiology between age-associated AD and Merkel cell loss. We will address this need
by creating a multi-omics atlas of AD at single-cell resolution in brain and skin tissues at critical age points
across the murine lifespan correlating with pre- and post-AD onset in humans. These efforts will support our
long-term goal to uncover rare cell types with unknown markers of AD and or inflammation, which will serve as
the mechanistic basis for future studies in a long-term proposal."
10949379,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Suprathreshold hearing disorders like hyperacusis are marked by dysfunction of fast-spiking Parvalbumin
positive interneuron (PVI) signaling and heightened cortical activity following peripheral sensorineural hearing
loss (SNHL). After cochlear injury, a rapid loss of interneuron-mediated inhibition in the auditory cortex occurs,
resulting in heightened spontaneous firing rates in cortical principal neurons, leading to hyper-synchrony and
hyper-responsiveness to sound.
The extent of PVI dysfunction can predict auditory plasticity and cortical response recovery after cochlear
damage. While many attribute PVI hypofunction solely to neuronal dysfunction, recent studies suggest non-
neural mechanisms may also play a role. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are extracellular structures crucial for PVI
function, regulating synaptic inputs, neuronal activity, and intrinsic excitability. PNNs tighten around PVI during
development, limiting plasticity, but their disruption can reopen a plasticity window. Noise exposure degrades
PNNs and reduces PV expression in PVI, increasing cortical excitability akin to hyperacusis.
PNN degradation may result from noise-induced trauma to PVIs or an inflammatory response involving activated
microglia. Microglia, primarily associated with immune responses, also regulate homeostasis, synaptic
connectivity, and neural activity. In CNS diseases, activated microglia can have detrimental effects, such as
excessive synaptic pruning, neuroinflammation, and alterations in neuronal excitability. However, they can also
promote regeneration and cellular remodeling. The hypothesis underlying this research suggests that PNNs and
microglia play critical roles in PV hypofunction and may be early factors in central gain disorders. The study aims
to: 1) Investigate chronic PNN degradation in deafferented regions of the auditory cortex after cochlear SNHL,
alongside an increase in activated microglia. 2) Examine the impact of regional microglia elimination shortly
before SNHL on central gain and hyperacusis symptoms. 3) Explore targeted activation of PVI, potentially
normalizing PNN and microglia expression, and reversing loudness hyperacusis symptoms.
In summary, suprathreshold hearing disorders like hyperacusis are associated with PVI dysfunction leading to
cortical hyperexcitability following SNHL. PNNs and microglia are proposed as crucial contributors to PVI
hypofunction and central gain disorders, and this research aims to uncover their roles and potential therapeutic
avenues for restoring normal auditory function."

Iron deficiency is the single most common nutrient deficiency in the world impacting one-third of the world’s
population. Recent analysis of the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) data established dietary iron intakes
are decreasing in the US population and the decline parallels increasing rates of anemia. Increases in iron
deficiency may be caused by declining diet quality and/or high rates of nutrition and food insecurity. Iron
deficiency is the leading cause of anemia which severely impacts physical and cognitive development, work
capacity, and leads to poor health outcomes. The WHO categorizes iron-deficiency anemia as hemoglobin levels
<120 mg/dL (non-pregnant females) and iron deficiency as ferritin levels <15 ng/mL in individuals over 5 years
old and <12 ng/mL in children under 5 years old. These ferritin levels, which are used clinically, are not agreed
upon. First, a level of 30 ng/mL has been suggested to have 92% sensitivity and 98% specificity for correlating
iron deficiency with the absence of iron stores in the bone marrow. Second, marginal iron depletion (normal
hemoglobin levels with inadequate ferritin stores, defined as ferritin levels between 15-30 ng/mL) is suggested
to impair cellular functions. In human studies, individuals with marginal iron depletion have reduced physical
work capacity, yet their ability to transport oxygen is not impaired. This indicates other pathways involved in
physical work capacity may be compromised, yet these cellular pathways and their mechanisms have yet to be
determined. Furthermore, the correlation between iron-dependent tissues and cellular compartments, blood
biomarkers of iron levels, and the cellular pathways that lead to reduced work capacity have not been
determined. Our preliminary data indicate that impairing iron status from mild to severe depletion in mouse
myoblast cells reduces cellular respiration and the contribution of ATP from mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation before the cellular biomarker (transferrin receptor) for iron deficiency responds. Our overall
objectives in this application are to 1) establish the relationship between blood values of ferritin and hemoglobin
with tissue and cellular compartment levels of iron, and 2) determine the relationship between iron status and
iron-dependent mitochondrial and cellular functional declines. Our central hypothesis is that (1) certain tissues
and cellular compartments are more susceptible to iron loss and deplete at different rates, occurring before blood
biomarkers/levels of iron decline, and (2) mitochondrial function is compromised with marginal iron depletion and
is an underlying cause of skeletal muscle reduced work capacity. We will test this hypothesis in two specific
aims. In the first aim, we will use an established mouse model and dietary iron intervention to alter iron status to
determine the association between commonly used blood biomarkers of iron status, tissue and cellular
compartment levels of iron status, and sex differences in iron distribution as a result of mild to severe iron
depletion. In the second aim, we will extend our studies in these models to determine the causes and
contributions of iron depletion related to mitochondrial ETC complex activity and mitochondrial substrate
utilization, both of which directly affect mitochondrial energy production capacity. This proposal is innovative in
concept and approach and will inform on safe and effective nutritional strategies for maintenance of iron levels
to maintain optimal mitochondrial function.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of hospitalization and death in patients with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), especially among Black adults with COPD. Black adults with COPD carry a
disproportionate CVD risk factor burden compared to White adults, with higher diabetes and hypertension
prevalence, lower physical activity levels, greater proportion of actively smoking individuals, and disparities in
guideline concordant statin therapy. Black individuals with COPD describe several barriers to engaging in CVD
risk reduction. For example, the complexity of COPD care leaves less time in clinic visits to proactively discuss
CVD prevention. Breathlessness limits physical activity, a key strategy to improve COPD outcomes and
decrease CVD risk. Black adults also face socially determined barriers and distrust in the health system. Prior
behavioral interventions have successfully engaged Black adults in CVD risk reduction but are not designed to
meet the unique needs of patients with COPD. Interventions to prevent CVD that simultaneously meet the needs
of COPD patients and the Black community are urgently needed. The overarching goal of this proposal is for me
to become an implementation scientist poised to lead clinical trials improving health equity. To accomplish this,
I will conduct mentored research to adapt existing interventions for CVD risk reduction in Black communities into
a novel multicomponent behavioral intervention called COPDHeart. COPDHeart will be tailored to the needs of
Black patients with COPD to increase the uptake of evidence-based Life's Essential 8 cardiovascular health
recommendations put forth in an American Heart Association Presidential Advisory. To accomplish this, I will in
Aim 1, identify barriers from patients, providers and interventionists to engaging with a multicomponent CVD
prevention intervention for Black adults with COPD; in Aim 2, iteratively refine the COPDHeart intervention with
user-centered design; and in Aim 3 determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of
COPDHeart in a pilot clinical trial. I will combine didactics with experiential learning and mentorship to develop
expertise in stakeholder-engaged research methods, behavioral intervention design, clinical trials, and
implementation science. I have engaged an interdisciplinary mentorship team (Drs. Monika Safford, Fernando
Martinez, and Neeta Thakur) and focused content advisors (Drs. Riffin, Benzo, Schoenthaler, Peña, and
Banerjee). The results of this project will inform a large-scale randomized controlled trial of COPDHeart. This
proposal will result in an innovative intervention focused on CVD risk reduction among Black patients with COPD,
a population that has disproportionate risk of adverse outcomes. Given that comorbid COPD and CVD contribute
to significant morbidity and mortality, especially among Black adults, this proposal has the potential for
substantial public health impact. My planned training will allow me to gain expertise in stakeholder engaged
research that is crucial for my long-term goals to become a leading clinical researcher and implementation
scientist focused on health equity in COPD."

African American (AA) individuals with prostate cancer (PCa) face significantly worse clinical outcome than
their European American (EA) counterparts. There is a strong correlation between the stage of disease
(localized versus metastatic) at diagnosis and long-term survival. While patients diagnosed with localized
disease have a 99% 5-year survival, patients presenting with metastatic disease have significantly worse
prospects, an about 32% 5-year survival. A minimally invasive, plasma based diagnostic method could
significantly improve chances of detecting PCa at an early stage and thus reduce PCa related mortality.
There are two, next generation sequencing (NGS)-based methods that likely have the required sensitivity and
specificity of early detection of PCa from liquid, plasma biopsies. The first is based on the altered fragmentation
profile of cancer derived cell free DNA (cfDNA). In this, whole genome sequencing (WGS) is applied to plasma
derived cfDNA and the ratio of short to normal fragment size indicates the presence of cancer. The second
method is based on a specific pattern of methylated DNA loci across the genome and combines cell-free
methylated DNA immunoprecipitation with high throughput sequencing.
We found that the altered cell free DNA fragmentation profile is a highly sensitive, robust indicator of the presence
of metastatic prostate cancer. In this proposal we will investigate whether this method can identify cases when
AA men present at diagnosis or at later time-point after post-primary treatment with metastatic PCa. We will also
investigate whether a clinically useful sensitivity and specificity is retained as we analyze samples at earlier
stages of disease.
We will benchmark and optimize an experimental and computational protocol to detect prostate cancer at various
stages based on the fragmentation profile of plasma derived cell free DNA. This will be applied to AA patients
that presented with metastatic disease at diagnosis or later developed metastatic disease, to AA PCa patients
with localized or locally advanced disease, and to AA PCa cases where sequential plasma was collected at
various times, ranging from right before surgery to ten years before disease progression.
We will determine the sensitivity and specificity of a fragmentomics profile-based method for early detection of
PCa of various disease stages.
Similarly, we will benchmark and optimize an experimental and computational protocol to detect prostate cancer
at various stages based on cell free methylated DNA profiles. The next generation sequencing based methylation
profiling of plasma derived cfDNA samples will be applied to AA PCa of various disease stages and we will
determine the sensitivity and specificity of DNA methylation profile-based method for early detection of PCa of
various disease stages.
This will establish a non-invasive method for the early detection of PCa of AA men."

Children living near industrial activities are at a heightened risk of poorer health, including stress, asthma, and
other respiratory illnesses. An increased understanding of climate change along with the results of prior studies
linking adverse health effects to fossil fuel activities have precipitated a shift towards alternative energy
sources such as wood biomass. As a result, the market for wood pellets is booming, and plants are springing
up across the US, especially in the deep south. Wood pellet plants are twice as likely to be in predominantly
Black communities that are additionally burdened with many health, social, economic, and infrastructural
disparities. Despite growing community concerns about environmental health impacts on communities
surrounding wood pellet plants, few studies have been conducted. Epidemiologic studies suggest that living
nearby industrial manufacturing, generally, and wood-related manufacturing, specifically, is associated with
negative respiratory health and psychological distress in children. However, these studies are limited due to
their inability to holistically characterize the pollutants emitted from wood pellet production when assessing
pediatric health impacts. We are proposing a place-based study in Mississippi–the least healthy state
regarding childhood respiratory diseases as 1 in every 10 children under the age of 18 has asthma, and 3.3%
more Black children than White children have asthma. Mississippi also has 7 wood pellet plants-4 fully
operational and 3 soon to be open (or in early development) that are anticipated to be the largest plants in the
world. Preliminary exposure data suggests that communities with active wood pellet plants have higher air and
sound levels than communities without active plants. Our research goals are to build on this preliminary data
and carry out an extensive air and noise pollution exposure assessment in three types of communities: t those
with an operational wood pellet plant, those with a proposed wood pellet plant, and those with no wood pellet
plants and no (or limited) other industrial manufacturing. We propose to conduct a combined ambient and
indoor sound and air pollution assessment (Aim 1 and Exploratory Aim) and will use these measurements to
assess their impact on children’s respiratory health and stress, also examining the extent to which
neighborhood resources, community stressors, and structural factors may modify these associations (Aim 2).
We will also invest in local human capital and engage the community by providing research training for
Mississippi-based high school students, community college students, undergraduate students, graduate
students, and older adults; community engagement activities using our app, NoiseScore; and environmental-
literacy tools using our activity book series. We will create a cohort of local researchers and concerned
residents who will become first-authors in their future stories. Together, we can develop strategies, policies,
and interventions to improve community health and well-being."

Bile duct cancer, also known as cholangiocarcinoma, is the second most common primary liver cancer. It
is considered to be an incurable cancer with no identifiable risk factors, that can rapidly become lethal,
unless it can be detected early enough to be fully resected. Cross-sectional imaging lacks sensitivity to
cellular structure and biochemical properties of the bile duct wall. While a combination of endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) based brush cytology and trans-papillary endobiliary
forceps biopsy, which is often considered the gold standard, has a high specificity, it offers only low
sensitivity. Another very significant challenge with the current standard of care approaches is difficulty in
acquiring tissue samples adequate for the histopathologic examination. Because of the poor prognosis, a
technique capable of reliably detecting pre-cancer of the bile duct is urgently needed. We recently
introduced a new diagnostic technology that combines light scattering spectroscopy and diffuse
reflectance spectroscopy to identify biliary duct pre-cancer and early cancer during routine diagnostic
ERCP procedures. It employs a single-point forward looking ultraminiature spatial gating fiber optic
probe. To ensure clinical acceptance of the technique and improve accuracy, scanning the entire internal
surface of the bile duct in a shorter time using an ERCP catheter-compatible probe, without the
requirement for a cholangioscope, would be a major advance. Therefore, we propose to develop a side
looking spatial gating fiber optic probe capable of parallel data collection at multiple locations on the bile
duct wall to significantly simplify and speed up the operation of the clinical system. We will test the
performance of the new endoscopic instrument in detecting bile duct pre-cancerous and early cancerous
lesions in patients undergoing ERCP for potential malignancies as well as inflammatory strictures and
gallstones."

Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, resulting in 9 million deaths
yearly. Current treatments for IHD are medications or surgical procedures to improve blood flow,
which cannot address the underlying permanent loss of cardiomyocytes (CMs) resulting from
myocardial infarction (MI). After MI, the heart undergoes fibrotic repair rather than regeneration.
This leads to maladaptive remodeling, further death of CMs, and eventual heart failure (HF) over
time. In IHD patients with HF, heart transplant becomes the only therapy. However, new cases of
HF far outpace the number of heart transplant procedures performed each year. Therefore, there
is an urgent need for therapeutics that directly address the loss of CMs. In neonatal mammalian
hearts post-MI and in adult hearts expressing active yes-associated protein 1 (YAP), a
transcriptional co-regulator of cell proliferation, CMs can re-enter the cell cycle and divide to
generate new CMs. I have uncovered that in both models, CM proliferation requires interplay
between poised CMs, cardiac fibroblasts (CFs), and tissue-resident macrophages (MPs); poised
CMs re-enter the cell cycle, while the Complement pathway, a component of innate immunity, is
activated in CFs and MPs to facilitate CM cell cycle progression and de-differentiation. Specifically,
C3 is activated in CFs and C3ar1 is activated in MPs, with C3 or C3ar1 knockout (KO) resulting
in decreased CM proliferation. The central hypothesis of this proposal is activation of
Complement alters the composition and metabolism of the cardiac microenvironment to
promote CM proliferation. The first aim investigates the direct role of C3ar1 resident MPs in CM
proliferation. C3ar1 MPs expand greatly during CM proliferation and express high levels of the
insulin growth factor pathway gene Igf1 and genes involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover
such as Adam15. I will assay CM proliferation and metabolism in resident MP-specific Igf1 KO or
Adam15 KO versus Control hearts, as well as ECM composition and stiffness. In the second aim,
I will study how C3-CFs induce glycolytic metabolism within the cardiac microenvironment in
response to MI. My preliminary data show that in neonatal C3 KO hearts, CFs failed to upregulate
glycolysis after MI, resulting in impaired cardiac repair compared to Control hearts. I will use CF-
specific C3 KO and Control hearts to determine if C3 is required for CF activation and whether
the metabolic stress response in MPs is impaired after MI. Altogether, the proposed project aims
to understand the interactions between different cell types of the renewal competent niche of in
vivo models of CM proliferation. I believe that this work extends our CM-centric understanding of
proliferation and may yield new insights and directions for cardiac renewal."

Post-stroke chronic aphasia is a prevalent language processing problem commonly associated with
significantly reduced quality of life. Unfortunately, our knowledge of the personalized factors underlying
aphasia severity remains incomplete, and only 50% of the variance can be explained by comprehensive
models that incorporate lesion characteristics, demographic variables, and cognitive factors. Importantly, age is
a predictor of aphasia severity, but this relationship is inconsistent and the interplay between age, age-related
brain integrity and aphasia is not well-understood. A better understanding of how aging affects brain integrity
and interferes with aphasia would clarify an important mechanism related to aphasia severity and reduce the
unexplained variance in clinical trajectories. A new breakthrough in neuroimaging can now bridge this
knowledge gap: brain age is a novel machine learning approach that can accurately measure age-related
neurodegeneration. Premature brain aging (PBA) relative to chronological age is strongly associated with
cardiovascular risk factors and is a powerful marker of decreased cognition and lowered brain plasticity in the
general population. Our team pioneered novel neuroimaging methods to measure PBA among stroke survivors
and our preliminary studies demonstrated that PBA is a common but underappreciated factor among stroke
survivors with aphasia. Many stroke survivors with aphasia have cardiovascular risk factors and PBA accounts
for a considerable proportion of the hitherto unexplained variability in aphasia severity and recovery. Crucially,
novel findings that significantly expand our understanding of aphasia severity are rare and it is therefore
important to better understand the mechanistic relationship between PBA and aphasia. We will leverage one of
the largest comprehensive demographic, behavioral and neuroimaging datasets in chronic aphasia (the Center
for the Study of Aphasia Recovery – C-STAR) and in healthy aging (the Aging Brain Cohort at University of
South Carolina – ABC@USC) to examine: 1) the influence of cardiovascular risk factors versus protective
cognitive variables such as education and multilingualism on PBA and aphasia (Specific Aim 1); 2) the
association between PBA confined to regional cortical areas and linguistic symptoms (Specific Aim 2); 3) the
importance of PBA affecting remote functional and structural networks and language impairments (Specific
Aim 3); and 4) whether stroke and chronic aphasia are associated with accelerated PBA in longitudinal cohorts
(Specific Aim 4). This research will provide pivotal insights into the recognized but inadequately understood
relationship between aging and aphasia and it will clarify factors that influence personalized aphasia
trajectories among many stroke survivors. Our team is uniquely positioned to perform this research given our
track record of multidisciplinary research in aphasia, neurology, neuroimaging and machine learning."

Nearly 13,000 new cases of laryngeal cancer are diagnosed in the U.S. annually. Transoral laser microsurgery
(TLM) has become the primary surgical approach for early-stage endolaryngeal tumors as TLM provides tumor
control while allowing maximal salvage of normal tissue to preserve post-treatment laryngeal function (i.e. voice
and swallow). However, no reliable intraoperative approaches are approved to aid the surgeon's subjective visual
assessment of tumor borders during TLM, leading to post-TLM recurrence of disease in a substantial proportion
of patients. Panitumumab-IRDye800 has been used in multiple clinical trials for near-infrared fluorescence
(NIRF) imaging during surgery of various malignancies. Current fluorescence guided surgery (FGS) clinical trials
using panitumumab-IRDye800 require intraoperative pathological confirmation of cancer before further surgical
actions can be made beyond the standard of care. Marginal biopsies during TLM are limited in volume and
number, which confounds pathological assessment and intraoperative attempts to identify clinically occult
invasive margins. The lack of FGS clinical studies during TLM in patients with laryngeal cancer has been a barrier
in determining if current metrics to guide FGS would be applicable during TLM procedures. Addressing this
clinical barrier is a critical step in determining the benefit of intraoperative NIRF to positively impact both TLM
surgery and outcomes in patients with laryngeal cancer. We propose a clinical study to demonstrate feasibility
for a novel combination of intraoperative optical imaging approaches to detect occult tumor margins in patients
with laryngeal cancer. Objective 1 will establish metrics of intraoperative optical imaging that define pathology-
confirmed occult laryngeal cancer margins. This objective will be accomplished by correlating intraoperative
imaging during total laryngectomy procedures with post-resection tissue analyses including histopathology as
the gold standard for true positive and true negative occult disease. Objective 2 will test the accuracy of
intraoperative optical imaging metrics to identify occult laryngeal cancer margins during TLM. This objective will
be accomplished using imaging metrics to identify positive optical signals beyond the region of treatment planned
in patients who undergo TLM. Outcomes from these studies will be used to design a randomized phase 2 trial to
test the combined imaging approach to guide TLM in patients with laryngeal cancer. The long-term outcomes of
these studies are anticipated to positively impact intraoperative identification of occult malignancy while
minimizing loss of critical laryngeal function."

Metastasis is the process in which disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) spread to distal tissues and organs, and it
is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. In order to complete the metastatic cascade, DTCs must be able
to invade distal sites, initiate tumor growth, proliferate, and promote a tumor microenvironment (TME) to evade
immune surveillance and promote angiogenesis. Elucidating novel mechanisms that underlie these metastatic
phenotypes in DTCs can identify key drivers of metastasis, as well as potential therapeutic vulnerabilities which
can better target metastatic tumors. My dissertation research focuses on elucidating the mechanisms in which
the lncRNA BORG (BMP/OP-Responsive Gene) drives breast cancer (BC) metastasis. My studies determined
that metastatic BC cells are reliant upon BORG complexing with E3 SUMO ligase TRIM28 to induce breast
cancer stem cells (BCSCs) to expand and self-renew both in vitro and in vivo. This work establishes BORG as
a novel driver of BCSCs, and therefore increases our understanding of the mechanisms driving the accumulation
of these malignant cell populations. My recent preliminary data suggests BORG:TRIM28 complexes
downregulate the expression of splicing factors in BC cells, which contributes to BCSC phenotypes. Interestingly,
accumulating evidence indicates that dysregulation of RNA splicing, a complex molecular tool that can control
cellular phenotypes through transcriptomic regulatory mechanisms, contributes to a variety of tumorigenic
phenotypes and even metastatic relapse. Therefore, during the F99 portion of this proposal, I seek to elucidate
the mechanism whereby BORG:TRIM28 complexes dysregulate RNA splicing operant in driving metastatic and
BCSC phenotypes in BC. To complete this research during my dissertation, I will (i) determine which splicing
factors dysregulated by BORG:TRIM28 complexes drive metastatic phenotypes in BC in vitro and in vivo, and
(ii) use RNAseq and subsequent validation to determine the specific alternative splicing events affected by a
subset of these splicing factors in BORG-expressing cells. This work will identify novel mechanisms of RNA
splicing regulation that play key roles in metastatic phenotypes of BC cells. During the K00 phase of this proposal,
I plan to work closely with my postdoctoral mentor to elucidate the mechanisms in which RNA splicing contributes
to tumor cell crosstalk with the TME to promote immune evasion and subsequent metastatic outgrowth.
Specifically, I plan to elucidate (i) how alternative splicing in tumor cells drive changes in the metastatic TME to
promote immune evasion, and (ii) how alternative splicing changes in TME cells, such as T cells and fibroblasts,
contribute to the metastatic niche and subsequent metastatic outgrowth. The current and future goals of my
research are to elucidate mechanisms in which dysregulated RNA splicing contributes to metastatic seeding and
outgrowth in aggressive cancers. My predoctoral and postdoctoral research will provide me with expertise in the
role of RNA splicing in cancer metastasis, and provide me with essential research and professional skills to
launch me into my independent research career at a leading research institute."

Immunotherapy has achieved promising outcomes in cancer treatments; however, most patients still do not
respond to the current therapies. There are several critical gaps in our current knowledge of what types of
immune cells exist in the tumor microenvironment and how their presence (or absence) impacts the tumor
immune surveillance. My long-term goal is to develop new cancer prevention and treatment approaches through
dissecting the diverse immune cells and their roles in the tumor microenvironment. My preliminary studies have
identified an enhanced antitumor effect for metastatic cancers by combining radiotherapy with the innate immune
sensing pathway activation (the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway). This proposal aims to identify novel immune
cell populations that contribute to the effective antitumor treatment strategy. The central hypothesis is that
specific subsets of immune cells induced by this treatment strategy are the major factors controlling tumor
treatment effects. Successful identification of these immune cell populations will improve our understanding of
antitumor immunity and cancer immunotherapies.
I will test the central hypothesis by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Characterize the immune cell heterogeneity in
tumors in response to STING activation (F99 phase); 2) Elucidate the mechanism of abscopal antitumor effects
achieved through the combination of cGAMP and radiotherapy (K00 phase). I will pursue these aims using an
innovative combination of experimental and computational techniques. I will use unbiased single-cell
transcriptome data analysis to identify novel cell populations critical for the tumor treatments and investigate their
functions in mouse models. The proposed research is significant because the unbiased genomics data allows
me to identify new mechanisms that may have a broad implication in other tumor types and aid in developing
new therapeutic strategies. This work will also develop resources that can be used by other researchers in the
cancer immunology field. The expected outcome of this work is: 1) identifying novel immune cell populations with
antitumor function, 2) offering rational combination strategies to improve antitumor effects, 3) informing the
design of cancer vaccines. This project will advance cancer immunology fields by providing new therapeutic
strategies for metastatic cancers. In addition, the skills and expertise obtained from both phases will prepare me
to become an independent researcher in cancer immunology."
10950633,"This research proposal seeks to uncover neuronal mechanisms orchestrating metabolic adaptations to
bacterial infections, specifically delineating the pivotal role of the brain-liver axis in modulating metabolic
responses. By combining the methods of neuroscience and immunology, the research aims to better
understand neuronal and hepatic responses to infections. I showed earlier that housing infected mice at
thermoneutrality instead of ambient room temperature better mimics human bacterial infections. For example,
infected mice at thermoneutrality develop severe hyperlipidemia, compromising survival. Here, I hypothesize
that circulating lipids are regulated by neuronal and hepatic mechanisms. In Goal 1, I will look for neurocircuits
in the hypothalamus that might monitor circulating lipoproteins and trigger counterregulatory responses. To do
this, I will use genetic mouse models and chemogenetics to stimulate and inhibit candidate neuronal clusters
during infections. In Goal 2, I will perform an unbiased screen to elucidate hepatic secretome using TurboID,
followed by targeted proteomics. I will target these hepatic factors in vivo to test their role in improving host
survival during bacterial infections. My approaches defining the molecular basis of hyperlipidemia in mouse
models are highly innovative and likely to provide novel insights into how circulating lipid levels determine host
survival."
10945178,"Motile cilia beat rhythmically to propel cell movement or drive extracellular fluid flow. The functional importance
of cilia motility in human health is highlighted by primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disease caused by
cilia motility defects. Patients with PCD display left-right asymmetry defect, reduced fertility and progressive lung
disease. Currently there is no specific therapy for PCD and management of symptoms has been the main
approach. The dynein arms that power cilia motility comprise multiple components that are pre-assembled in the
cytosol and many genes associated with PCD encode components of dynein arms. A separate group encode
dynein arm assembly factors (DNAAFs), proteins that reside in the cytosol and facilitate the assembly of dynein
arm subunits. Interestingly, multiple DNAAFs are localized in droplet shaped cytosolic foci. However, the precise
function of these foci and the precise molecular function of most DNAAFs remain poorly understood. Based on
extensive preliminary and published data, our central hypothesis is that the co-chaperone proteins Ruvbl1 and
Ruvbl2 are core components of a novel membrane-less cytosolic assemblage that functions to coordinate the
translation, folding and assembly of axonemal dynein arm components. In this project, we will combine zebrafish
genetics, mouse genetics and cultured tracheal cells to test our central hypothesis. We propose two specific
aims to achieve this goal. In the first aim, we will dissect the mechanism of Ruvbl1-Ruvbl2 foci formation. In the
second aim, we will systematically define R2HAD components and dissect their biochemical and functional
relationships with DNAAFs associated with PCD. Successful completion of this project will not only provide a
molecular framework for dynein arm assembly and the etiology of PCD, but also lay the foundation for future
investigation into the regulation, and possible intervention, of dynein arm assembly and cilia motility under
diverse physiological and disease conditions."

Aging, particularly the rapid increase in disease prevalence with age, has emerged as one of the top health
challenges in the world today. Life expectancy in the United States has increased by nearly a decade over the
last 50 years, but so too has the incidence of musculoskeletal problems, heart disease, cancer, and especially
dementia late in life. Discoveries of conserved genetic pathways in animals that increase both longevity and
healthspan have raised the hope that we can build upon on growing understanding of the biology of aging to
find interventions that allow us to live longer, healthier lives. Most of these genetic studies have been
conducted within a few laboratory-adapted model organisms. Using natural variation to investigate the genetics
of aging provides the opportunity to discover new pathways that enhance aging, particularly in ways that do not
create negative pleiotropic effects across the organism as a whole. Here, we propose to use our recent
discovery of an exceptionally long-lived natural isolate of the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a
discovery platform to better understand the biology aging and to discover novel genetic targets for aging
interventions. We have implemented unique approaches to genetic mapping that capitalize upon the rapid
generation time and very large population sizes of C. elegans to select for highly recombinant individuals with
extreme phenotypes. Further, we will use a novel genomic engineering approach to generate targeted
recombination events within regions of interest. Analyzing these natural isolates, as well as targeted knockouts
of known aging related pathways, using a transcriptional “aging clock” will allow us both to isolate the genes of
interest and to assess their physiological impacts at single-cell resolution. And most importantly from a
translational point of view, we will investigate how genetic background influences the response to longevity
extending compound interventions. Specifically, we aim to (1) Identify the genetic basis of longevity extension
in an extraordinarily long-lived natural isolate of C. elegans, (2) Analyze the functional landscape of natural
variation in longevity and develop tissue-specific aging clocks using allelic substitution lines and genetic
knockouts of well-characterized stress-response pathways, (3) Determine the genetic basis of natural variation
in the response to life-extending compound interventions. Success of these aims will provide novel insights into
the fundamental biology of aging and provide new genetic targets for researchers seeking to enhance healthy
aging in humans."
10944037,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Although research linking race-based residential segregation to health outcomes has been conducted for
decades, there is currently a lack of understanding of how exposure to residential segregation affects the
universal aging process that underlies development of chronic disease. Our long-term goal is to understand how
a fundamental cause of racial health disparities, residential segregation, leads to physiologic dysregulation
through examination of modifiable causal pathways. The overall objectives of this application are (i) to measure
the association between residential segregation and age acceleration over the adult life course; and (ii) identify
the mechanisms through which living in a segregated neighborhood affects age acceleration. The central
hypothesis is that exposure to residential segregation over the adult life course is associated with worse (higher)
clinical marker-derived age acceleration, a marker of stress-related cumulative physiological dysregulation. The
rationale for this project is that our findings may strengthen the evidence base for policy recommendations by
demonstrating that structural factors harm the universal aging process, making equity important for all of society.
The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine the relationship of
exposure to levels of residential segregation and age acceleration in adulthood in Black CARDIA
participants; 2) Identify neighborhood-level mediators of the relationship between residential
segregation and age acceleration; and 3) Using a life-course lens, determine if timing and length of
exposure to residential segregation affects its relationship with age acceleration. For the first aim mixed
effects growth models and parallel process growth models will be used to measure the relationship between
residential segregation and age acceleration. The second aim will use structural equation modeling to determine
if neighborhood SDOH mediates the influence of living in residentially segregated neighborhoods and increased
age acceleration. The third aim will use path analysis to test the pathways hypothesized through each life course
model. The research proposed is innovative because 1) it will be the first attempt to link structural factors to our
novel measure of accelerated biological aging, and 2) it focuses on untangling how residential segregation works
to harm health over the adult life course. The proposed research is significant because research shows structural
racism and its downstream consequences, termed the social determinants of health (SDOH), produce racial
disparities in health outcomes but far less work has examined how structural racism affects the aging process
that is the basis for many chronic diseases (e.g., cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension, stroke). Even
less work has examined how the timing of exposure to structural and social determinants of health (S/SDOH)
during the life course affects aging, making this project of vital importance."
10944038,"PROJECT SUMMARY. The proposed study responds to NOT-MD-23-008, which calls for community-engaged
interventions to increase vaccine uptake among populations experiencing health disparities. We focus on
COVID-19 and influenza vaccination, both of which now require annual vaccines. Among those at highest risk
for morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality are African American/Black and Latino (ABBL) persons who are not
up-to-date on these vaccinations. Only 20-28% of adult AABL persons are up-to-date on COVID-19
vaccination, compared to 31% of White persons, and
only 30-40% of AABL persons receive the influenza
vaccine annually compared to >55% among White persons. AABL experience serious impediments to COVID-
19 (and to a lesser extent, influenza) vaccination at individual- (e.g., distrust, insufficient knowledge, low
perceived risk, cognitive biases), social- (e.g., peer norms), and structural-levels of influence (e.g., poor
access). Taken together, these comprise multi-level vaccine hesitancy. Factors that promote vaccination
include trusted AABL health educators (peers, nurses), tapping into altruism and collective responsibility,
circumventing cognitive biases, and reducing structural barriers. Without efforts to address multi-level vaccine
hesitancy, rates of COVID-19 and influenza vaccination will remain unacceptably low and racial/ethnic health
disparities in infectious disease morbidity and mortality will persist. The proposed study is led by a collaborative
team at New York University and the Northern Manhattan Improvement Corporation. It uses the multiphase
optimization strategy (MOST), an engineering-inspired framework, to test effects of individual candidate
intervention components in a factorial design and then optimize a multi-component intervention made up of the
most cost-effective combination of components. Staying up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccination (confirmed with
documentary evidence) is the primary outcome, and influenza vaccination is the secondary outcome. We have
identified four promising candidate components, with an emphasis on brevity, low-touch, and future scalability:
A) nurse-led shared decision making, B) a text message intervention, C) modest lottery prizes for vaccination,
and D) peer navigation to vaccination appointments. Participants will be N=560 community-residing adult
English and Spanish-speaking AABL persons who are not up-to-date on COVID-19 and influenza vaccinations
but with at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose. Specific aims are: Aim 1) identify which of four components
contribute meaningfully to improvement in the outcomes; Aim 2) identify mediators (e.g., altruism, norms) and
moderators (e.g., sociodemographic characteristics, distrust) of the effects of each component; and Aim 3)
build the most cost-effective intervention package(s). Participants will be randomly assigned to an experimental
condition, and assessed at 3- and 6-months post-baseline; N=45 participants will engage in qualitative in-depth
interviews. We will also uncover, describe, and plan for implementation issues so the optimized intervention
can be rapidly scaled up by community-based and outpatient health organizations."
10944689,"The underlying causes of neuronal cell loss in Parkinson's disease (PD) and related synucleinopathies, including Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), remain elusive. There is compelling evidence suggesting that alterations in histone acetylation play a significant role in cognition and brain function, and that aberrant histone acetylation is associated with both, neurodegenerative diseases and aging. However, our understanding of the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms driving changes in histone acetylation, and how dysregulated histone acetylation contributes to age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as PD, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and related dementias (ADRD) remains limited.
To comprehensively explore the role of histone acetylation in the development of PD, LBD and MSA, we established a novel human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-based discovery platform. This platform offers a robust and screenable experimental system that replicates many disease-relevant characteristics within neuronal cells. Using this discovery platform, we employed a combination of SILAC proteomics and genome-wide CRISPR screening to identify modifiers of histone acetylation that contribute to α-Synuclein (α-Syn) pathology. Consistent with these in vitro results, we find similar changes in postmortem brain tissue sample from PD patients.
Given that one of the primary functions of histone acetylation is to regulate gene expression, we speculate the dysregulated transcription, resulting from α-Syn-mediated disruption of histone acetylation modifying enzymes, contributes to the neurodegeneration seen in PD, LBD and related synucleinopathies. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate the functional significance of histone acetylation in pathogenesis of PD, LBD and related synucleinopathies. Our approach involves a wide range of disease-relevant hPSC-based cellular model systems to investigate the impact of modulating histone acetylation, through disrupting or enhancing the activity of histone acetylation modifying enzymes, on α-Syn-mediated neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Furthermore, we will employ molecular and epigenomics techniques to define the epigenetic alterations and chromatin-regulated gene expression signatures linked to α-Syn pathology. Given that α-Syn pathology is the defining characteristic of PD, LBD and MSA and is frequently observed as co-pathological feature in AD and ADRD, we will extend our molecular and epigenetic investigations to include a broad range of postmortem brain tissue samples from patients. Thus, we aim to establish a correlation between α-Syn pathology and aberrant histone acetylation as a common feature in PD and ADRD.
The proposed experiments hold the potential to provide novel mechanistic insights into the epigenetic aspects of PD, LBD and related synucleinopathies. As drugs targeting histone modifiers are currently under development as potential therapeutics for various conditions, there exists considerable interest in understanding how modulating histone acetylation could be used to treat PD, LBD and ADRD."
10894773,"CORE SUMMARY
The Mutant Mouse Core (Core B) is an essential core that will be used extensively by all three projects. Given 
the complex interplay between different inhibitory receptors on multiple cell types, the only way one can dissect 
these critical disease-related biological questions in vivo is with sophisticated mouse models. A significant 
strength of this PPG application is the unique ‘immunological toolbox’ that it will utilize, specifically PD1/LAG3 
floxed mice combined with a unique collection of lineage-specific, and in most instances temporally controlled, 
Cre recombinase-expressing mice. These tools will give us unprecedented control and thus insight into 
PD1/LAG3 synergy and function in multiple cell types. 
AIM 1: To provide required PD1/LAG3 mutant mice. The Core will be administered from the University of 
Pittsburgh (Pitt), with the majority of the mutant mouse breeding and procurement outsourced to Taconic under 
Murine Pathogen Free barrier conditions identical to the majority of their commercial breeding practices. Taconic 
will deliver mice to all research sites on a rotating bi-weekly basis using their conventional delivery mechanism, 
thereby avoiding lengthy quarantine. 
AIM 2: To generate new mutant mouse combinations. The Core will generate new mutant mouse 
combinations that introduce different genetic elements such as new Cre stains. 
PPG Interactions: Core B will support Project 1, Project 2 and Project 3 extensively, and interact with Core 
A to provide easy access to breeding, shipping and genotyping data. Core B will also perform additional crosses 
to generate any strain combinations required by the projects. Core B will interact with Core A to provide easy 
access to breeding, shipping and genotyping data and ongoing monitoring."
10894774,"CORE SUMMARY
The overall goal of this PPG application is to compare and contrast the mechanisms by which the inhibitory 
receptors PD1 and LAG3 operate on T cells in the context of tolerance and autoimmunity, cancer, and chronic 
infection. One major approach to be used throughout the studies is the application of genome-wide 
transcriptional profiling. The purpose of the Functional Genomics and Computational Biology Core (Core C) is 
to provide essential and centralized sequencing-based genomics services for all three Projects in this Program. 
In addition, this Core will operate provide the service of a retroviral (RV)-enforced expression and knockdown 
platform that can directly test in vivo individual genes and pathways identified from computational analyses. Thus, 
Core C will provide integrated bioinformatic and computational analytical platforms and data integration services 
coupled to downstream RV-enforced expression and knockdown as well as in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-focused 
genetic screening. The Aims are:
AIM 1: To provide initial data hosting, normalization, preprocessing, and analysis as well as perform 
cross-Project data integration and computational network modeling for bulk and single-cell 
transcriptomic and epigenetic datasets. Core C will (i) provide raw data QC, data cleaning, pre-processing, 
and generation of files for downstream analyses as well as operate a web portal interface for user exploration of 
the data; (ii) perform primary and secondary genomics data analyses; and (iii) perform network and integrated 
analyses including. The Core also will support and/or develop new analytical tools as technologies become 
available (as for scRNA-seq in the last cycle). 
AIM 2: To enable in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 screening and provide an RV-enforced expression and 
knowckdown platform for downstream in vivo interrogation of genes and pathways regulated by PD-1 
and/or LAG3. Core C will aid in design of CRISPR screening libraries for in vivo CRISPR screening platforms 
by the Projects as well as downstream data analysis. Core C will also provide an in vivo retroviral platform to 
enforce expression or shRNA knock-down of high-priority GOIs. 
By its nature, Core C is highly interactive with other components of this PPG. Samples from Projects 1, 2, and 
3 will enter Core C, which will analyze samples with input from the Projects and integrate results among the 
three Projects. Core C will interact heavily with Cores A, B, and D for administrative support and to identify gene 
targets for novel mouse strains and immunostaining analysis."
10950663,"This Research Education Program is designed to provide teaching in the science of
investigation, in addition to protected time, structure, resources, mentoring, and research skills
training to diverse and outstanding neurology residents who will become the next generation of
leaders in clinical neuroscience research. Some unique aspects of our programs are (1) that we
are able to provide six to nine months of 80% protected time for research education and
research participation during residency; and (2) that we pair each participant with both a Senior
Mentor and a Junior Mentor who are closely engaged in the participant’s research and training.
The Hopkins environment is highly collaborative across disciplines and provides superb
research education resources, through the Clinical and Translational Science Award, the
Bloomberg School of Public Health, The Brain Sciences Institute, Neuro-ICE (Institute of
Cellular Engineering), the Kirby Functional Imaging Center, The Mind Brain Institute, and many
other interdisciplinary programs. This program is also designed to develop a diverse group of
talented and inspirational mentors who will continue to serve role models and effective coaches,
enabling residents and fellows to become independent clinician scientists with a passion for
discovery in the mechanisms of neurological disease, improving diagnosis and treatment of
neurological disease, and facilitating recovery of neurological function. We accomplish this aim
through mentoring of Junior Mentors by Senior Mentors, with structured feedback and
evaluations. To date this grant has supported exceptional residents, who all remain actively
engaged in research. Three have faculty positions in medical schools, and many of these have
obtained K08 or K23 funding. The others remain in residency or fellowship training. The
program has also been exceptionally successful in recruiting participants and Junior Mentors
from minorities that are traditionally under-represented in science. We have also been very
successful in including women both as mentors and mentees."
10947414,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Calcific Aortic Valve Disease (CAVD) will affect 3% of people over the age of 75. CAVD disease
progression is characterized by an active deposition of calcific noduli and extracellular matrix proteins. This
excessive deposition results in valvular thickening, outflow tract narrowing, restricted blood flow, left ventricular
hypertrophy, and eventual heart failure. Despite the clinical significance of this disease, patients must “watch
and wait” until surgical AV replacement and repair is necessary, as currently no pharmacotherapeutics exist.
This proposal focuses on identifying novel epigenetic mechanisms underlying calcific aortic valve disease
progress and pathophysiology. For preliminary investigation on the role of epigenomic regulators in valve
calcification, we re-mined proteomic datasets to specifically probe differential abundance of epigenetic factors –
that is, proteins involved in histone post-translational modification reading, writing, and erasing. The preliminary
data presented in this proposal shows that enzymes responsible for histone regulation are differentially abundant
in valvular tissue as a function of disease stage, structural localization within the valve leaflet, as well as within
VIC cultures as a function of calcification induction media (inorganic vs. organic phosphate media). However,
the dataset mined was not exhaustive in identification as it was untargeted. Additionally, our preliminary data did
not investigate the regulatory role epigenetics plays in downstream translational and post-translational signaling
required for cell-cell, cell-matrix, and cell-vesicle mediated signaling. The proposed research capitalizes on an
ever-expanding cohort of clinically defined human adult CAVD aortic valve tissue, as well as an extensive
biobank of valvular interstitial cells isolated from human donors. It is our central hypothesis that there are unique
histone modifications that contribute to pathological development of calcification in human aortic valves. Aim 1
will use novel mass spectrometry approaches to define the histone code of CAVD along with corresponding
transcriptional regulation via Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing. Aim 2 will determine cell-mediated
spatially localized translational targets downstream of epigenetic regulation, utilizing multi-modal
histopathological imaging, laser capture microdissection, and low-input proteomic strategies. Aim 3 will
investigate the role of epigenomic modifications on microenvironment signaling mediated by N-linked
glycosylation. By mapping the histone code of aortic valve calcification and identifying both upstream epigenetic
regulators and downstream transcriptional, translational, and post-translational targets of this epigenetic
regulation, we aim to identify potential pharmacotherapeutic targets that may halt progression of CAVD. These
studies will be conducted by Dr. Clift under the mentorship of Dr. Elena Aikawa, a pioneer in cardiovascular
systems biology, as well as an advisory committee dedicated to proposed research and trainee. By utilizing this
mentorship and professional development via the MOSAIC UE5, Dr. Clift is primed for successful independence."

Cannabis is a widely used psychoactive substance among young adults (YAs), with ~44% using in the past
year. Daily use by YAs not attending college (14.5%) is 3x the prevalence of daily use by college attending
peers (4.7%). Cannabis is associated with acute and longer-term consequences. A growing concern among
researchers and clinicians is of frequent and/or high-intensity use (i.e., daily/near daily use, use multiple times
a day, and use of higher potency THC products). Although published research has grown exponentially in the
last decade regarding correlates and consequences of cannabis, development and evaluation of efficacious
brief interventions to reduce cannabis use is still needed. Mobile health (mHealth) technology may help
address gaps between clinical need and formal clinical services, particularly for non-treatment seeking YAs
and those typically underserved and underrepresented in research such as non-college YAs. The proposed
R34 application uses a multi-method user-informed approach to develop a novel brief motivational mHealth
intervention that incorporates cutting-edge cannabis intervention research. The proposed intervention is an
integrated mobile-enhanced web-based program with subsequent text messages for 5 weeks that provides
reflection on YAs’ cannabis use in 5 domains: (1) patterns/potency of use, (2) motivations for use, (3) social
connections and use, (4) personal use goals and use and (5) protective behavioral strategies. The intervention
prioritizes autonomy and will allow YAs to direct their journey through the program and allowing for self-
identification of personal reduction goals. YAs are at different places with respect to readiness to change, thus
by allowing the YA to direct their journey, the program will present appropriate content based on their interests
and tailored to their self-efficacy and readiness to change. YAs will have opportunity to reflect on motivations
for using cannabis, and when appropriate, cognitive behavioral skills-training for substance-free strategies for
coping with negative mood and emotions, potential for engaging in substance-free activities, social skill
building, exploration of the relationships among values, future goals, and cannabis use, and opportunities to
explore lower-risk use. Aim 1: Develop a YA cannabis intervention (Take 5) to reduce cannabis use and
negative consequences among non-collegiate YAs engaging in frequent/high-intensity cannabis use. Focus
groups and user experience interviews will inform the development of the intervention. Aim 2: Conduct a 6-
month pilot study with non-collegiate YAs in WA (who use cannabis 15+ days/month, use 2+ times per day
when use, or use high-potency THC products [60%+]) to determine feasibility and acceptability. 120 YAs will
be randomized to Take 5 (n=60) or attention control condition (n=60). The present application addresses
several priorities in NIDA’s Strategic Plan, including using technology (e.g., smartphones) to deliver
interventions and inclusion of high-risk vulnerable populations (i.e., non-college attending YAs)."
10948457,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Sensation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is necessary for physiologic and pathophysiologic processes. During
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colonic inflammation induces a hypersensitivity to mechanical stimuli, triggering
abdominal pain. The sensory neurons that innervate the colon and mediate abdominal pain are those with cell bodies within
the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), the DRG sensory neurons. I have recently identified five genetic subtypes of DRG sensory
neurons that innervate the colon and have distinct morphologies and physiologic response properties to distension. I found
that one of these populations, which expresses Bmpr1b, is necessary for inflammation-induced mechanical hypersensitivity.
However, which of the other populations, in particular those that are potential pain-mediating neurons, or nociceptors, are
involved in mediating colonic inflammation-induced mechanical hypersensitivity is unknown. Further, mechanistic details
of how mechanotransduction is mediated in colon innervating DRG neurons remain elusive, as does the mechanism through
which inflammation causes mechanical hypersensitivity. In Aim 1, I propose to use neuronal electrophysiology and mouse
behavior experiments to determine if two other nociceptor populations, which express Sstr2 or Adra2a, are necessary for
colonic inflammation-induced hypersensitivity, to expand our knowledge of the function of colon-innervating nociceptors.
In Aim 2, I will determine differences in localization of the mechanosensory ion channel Piezo2, morphologies, or
ultrastructural properties of colon innervating DRG neurons with distinct mechanical force thresholds, with or without
inflammation, to determine mechanisms of in vivo mechanotransduction. Finally, in Aim 3, I propose to use neuronal
electrophysiology to determine the mechanism through which inflammation causes mechanical hypersensitivity, in
particular through cytokine or prostaglandin signaling. These studies will reveal mechanisms of mechanosensation and
inflammation-induced mechanical hypersensitivity in colon innervating sensory neurons, and perhaps reveal therapeutic
targets to treat abdominal pain in IBD patients.
 I am a physician-scientist applying for a K08 with the long-term goal of becoming a tenure-track, independent
laboratory investigator and academic clinician. I envision developing a research program focused on the mechanisms
through which GI tract innervating sensory neurons respond to diverse stimuli to control physiologic and pathophysiologic
processes. During my proposed K08 research training, I will perform mentored research in the lab of Dr. David Ginty in the
Department of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School (HMS), a world expert in the field of peripheral neurobiology,
while completing my clinical gastroenterology training at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). I have assembled an
expert scientific advisory committee to help guide my K08 research and career development, including Dr. Ramnik Xavier
(MGH), Dr. Arlene Sharpe (HMS), and Dr. Clifford Woolf (Children’s Hospital). I will also collaborate with and receive
input from Dr. Steve Liberles (HMS) and Dr. Isaac Chiu (HMS). I believe that training at HMS and MGH, both world-class
research and clinical environments, along with additional conferences and coursework will help me achieve my long-term

10947516,"I aim to become an independent researcher who studies parenting in diverse cultures via multiple methods
and who builds, tests, and evaluates culturally sensitive preventive interventions for ethnically diverse families.
This project will build on my expertise in parental psychological control (conceptualization, measurement, and
mechanisms), my skills in quantitative data analyses, and my experience with questionnaire data collection.
Additional training in family observations and interviews and solidifying my expertise in Latinx parenting (K99)
will equip me to test my culturally sensitive mechanisms of PPC longitudinally (R00) and develop and evaluate
culturally sensitive preventive interventions for culturally diverse families (future R01). My efforts to promote
equity based on my background—coming from poverty, being a first-generation college student, having
recovered from physical disabilities, and being a woman—make me eligible for the Maximizing Opportunities for
Scientific and Academic Independent Careers program to enhance workforce diversity.
Parental psychological control (PPC)—a set of intrusive parenting behaviors that emotionally manipulate children
to obey their parents—has been associated with diverse negative developmental outcomes reported in more
than 770 papers. However, the lack of culturally sensitive measures and of the mechanisms of PPC limits our
understanding of if and how PPC impairs children’s development in diverse cultures. Although behaviors
ethnically diverse families consider to be intrusive may differ from what white American families consider intrusive,
this cultural variability of intrusiveness has been neglected in the PPC research literature. Drawing from my Two
Facet Parental Psychological Control conceptual framework, I will measure what Mexican immigrant families
believe to be intrusive (K99). Drawing from the Family Stress Model and the Integrative model for studying
children’s developmental competencies of minority children, I will test a culturally sensitive mechanism of PPC in
a longitudinal study (R00) with my refined PPC questionnaire from K99.
In the K99 phase, I will observe and interview families and administer my PPC questionnaire to families to adapt
my questionnaire to Mexican immigrant families. I will include fathers, who have been excluded from most PPC
research, and adopt mixed methods to use interview and observation results to generate culturally sensitive items
and refine my items. In the R00 phase, I will test longitudinally whether parents’ enculturative stress and beliefs
about traditional gender roles (e.g., machismo, marianismo) predict PPC and whether that PPC then predicts
children’s poor health. With this training, I will later examine culture-specific and unique impacts of PPC in
diverse cultures. My results will provide a reproducible methodology for other researchers to create culturally
sensitive measures of PPC based on what people in those cultures believe to be intrusive, which will provide a
foundation for culturally sensitive preventive interventions to improve ethnically diverse children’s health and
well-being. This project closely fits NICHD’s mission “to ensure the independence and well-being ofall people.”"

Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a critical social determinant of health, affecting over 40% of women and men
in the US. IPV is particularly prevalent in Alaska and disproportionately impacts American Indian and Alaska
Native individuals. Given the widespread prevalence, impact on marginalized communities, and associated
adverse outcomes, prevention strategies are urgently needed. Public health nurses (PHNs) can play a key role
in IPV prevention, particularly in rural and underserved communities. These nurses work “upstream” to prevent
and mitigate risks for underlying social determinants of health and have unique skills in communication,
collaboration, promoting health equity, and applying evidence-informed approaches. Alaska has a unique
geography and largely centralized public health system with a statewide infrastructure to deploy prevention
practices. In their 2018-2021 strategic plan, Alaska’s statewide Section of PHN, within their Department of
Health, made IPV a priority focus area. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the PHN strategic plan lapsed as their
focus shifted to infection control, even as IPV grew in Alaska. The Alaska Section of PHN is now recentering
their prevention efforts and updating their strategic plan. To guide their strategic planning process, we propose
a practice-based research partnership between academic researchers at two leading research institutions and
Alaska’s statewide Section of PHN to advance the use of high-impact, evidence-informed IPV prevention
practices throughout the state. With input from Advisory Board members representing diverse organizations in
Alaska, a team of interdisciplinary researchers and practitioners with expertise in IPV prevention, public health
systems, practice-based research, mixed methods, and implementation science will initiate an Implementation
Mapping process that combines quantitative data from existing sources (i.e., administrative data documenting
PHN activities across the state) with newly acquired qualitative data from focus groups with PHNs and other
state public health leaders. Specifically, we will: (1) describe the array of IPV practices delivered by PHNs
throughout the state; (2) identify barriers to and facilitators of effective implementation of IPV practices
delivered by PHNs; and (3) develop implementation strategies for PHNs to overcome common barriers to
effective implementation of evidence-informed IPV practices using established implementation science
frameworks: RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) and the Consolidated
Framework for Implementation Science (CFIR). This project is closely aligned with the Social Determinants of
Health and Health Equity research lenses of the National Institute of Nursing Research. Identifying and
implementing IPV prevention practices that are evidence-informed, feasible, culturally relevant, and
contextually appropriate is critical to the advancement of IPV prevention led by PHNs in Alaska. Findings will

10951923,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE: SUMMARY
 This Administrative Core provides support and oversight for the P20 FORWARD Center. The Core will have
two major tasks: 1) to facilitate the administration and higher-level management of the Center, providing access
to expertise and resources as needed by the ESIs to achieve their immediate research goals, and 2) to support
the career development of the ESIs through the successful completion of the project and the development of
emergent new research proposals. The Core will also facilitate interactions with the NIDDK CAIRIBU and the
broader research community as well as compliance with appropriate local and federal regulations and data
availability requirements. The Core Director provides advice, encouragement, and resources, but the overall
research project was developed, and will be executed, primarily by the three co-investigator ESIs. The Core will
provide a central communications hub between the ESIs who are working in three different locations, providing
easy access to videoconferencing for both group discussions and communication with outside experts and with
the broader benign urology research community. All three ESI, as well as the PI, have previously been, and
continue to be, involved with CAIRIBU and are familiar with the organization and its various in-person and online
meetings. The Core Director will ensure that the ESIs attend scheduled CAIRIBU meetings, will arrange for
scientific updates by Center investigators at the CAIRIBU Annual Meeting, and facilitate ongoing communication
with the CAIRIBU Interactions Core providing an interface with NIDDK. The Research Project will provide a
molecular and cellular description of mouse models of prostate inflammation and hyperplasia, their individual
transcriptomic, histologic, and functional characteristics, and the parallels to, and differences from, specific
aspects of human BPH. The project addresses a major knowledge gap and will generate data that will support
the development of new funding proposals to support funding proposals. The Core Director will provide access
to resources including human patient transcriptomic databases and annotated human clinical samples that will
be used to compare mouse models to human BPH. The Administrative Core will ensure that studies are
completed and submitted for publication in a timely manner. The Core will be responsible for ensuring that data
are deposited in a publicly available and easily understood form in a timely manner and will publicize the
development of a database that can be interrogated through an RShiny application to be developed in the project.
The major long-term goal of this Center is to help the ESIs to move to independent research careers. The project
will develop data that can be used to support funding proposals. Such proposals require rigorous development
to allow them to succeed in the review process. As such, the Administrative Core will oversee the establishment
and regular meetings of committees of appropriately skilled and experienced individuals to provide relevant
advice and insights on proposals as they are developed and through the submission process."
10951924,"SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PROJECT: SUMMARY
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is common, resulting in significant morbidity, billions of dollars in annual
medical expenses, and even greater costs to the economy in lost productivity. BPH is characterized by stromal
and glandular hyperplasia, occurring focally in the transition zone of the prostate restricting urinary flow. The
underlying causes of this focal growth are still unclear. Chronic inflammation is clearly associated with BPH and
some have hypothesized a causal link, but data supporting this are limited. No comprehensive description of the
immune environment in the mouse prostate currently exists, likely due to the scarcity of prostatic inflammation
in background strains. Inadequate characterization of BPH models leaves them subject to scrutiny during the
review process, so a direct comparison of mouse models with prostatic inflammation and hyperplasia both to
one another and to human tissue is necessary to identify models appropriate to a specific research direction.
This project aims to bridge this knowledge gap by utilizing single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to identify the
similarities between murine models and human BPH with the hypothesis that specific cell states, with
expression profiles that mirror those in human tissues, will be found in individual mouse models
indicating those aspects of human disease reflected in the model. The primary objective is to provide a
basis to select project-appropriate BPH models through a comprehensive analysis of cellular composition and
transcriptomic profiles, supplemented with measures of voiding function and histopathology. Furthermore, these
studies will provide an accessible database of cellular, pathological, and voiding function information for each
model that can be used as a benchmark and expanded by the benign urologic community. The searchable
database will be an invaluable resource for the BPH research community, providing guidance on murine model
selection and facilitating molecular and functional queries. Two Specific Aims will be pursued by a
multidisciplinary team of three early-stage investigators (ESIs). First, we will complete a comparative cellular
and functional characterization of mouse models of prostate hyperplasia. This aim will apply scRNA-seq
to individual prostate lobes of six different models of prostatic inflammation and hyperplasia, as well as immune
cell profiling for T and B cell receptor sequencing in mouse models and human BPH tissues. Histopathological
and voiding function evaluations will also be included. In the second aim, we will develop a reference database
and calculate the BPH-indicated functional distance between mouse and reference cellular populations.
This aim will provide a bioinformatic comparison of all cells between each model as well as overlay cell types
from each model to existing human scRNA-seq data to look for common cell states. Resources to make these
data available to the scientific community, as a collection in the CellxGene portal and as an RShiny application,
will also be developed in this aim. We anticipate this work will lead to an improved use of current models for BPH
research, provide a basis for future R01 applications by each ESI, and lead to future novel pre-clinical studies."
10951940,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Preterm Birth (PTB) is a global problem and preemies are at risk for major disability. At the present time, 10-14%
of US births are premature depending on maternal ethnicity. African Americans are disproportionally affected; a
recognized health disparity. The regulation of birth timing is unknown and PTB cannot be prevented. Tocolytics
currently employed have unwanted effects on mother and fetus limiting dosing and none are FDA approved.
Tocolytic approaches to prevent PTB must be based on myometrial relaxation mechanisms known to be unique.
This is an urgent and unmet need exacerbated because the regulation of uterine smooth muscle relaxation is
disparate from that of other smooth muscles.
Activation of cAMP-protein kinase (PKA) by the β2 agonist terbutaline, or blockade of calcium entry by nifedipine
is unable to provide meaningful tocolysis, and while nitric oxide relaxes term myometrium, it does so in a cGMP-
independent manner. Moreover, nitric oxide-mediated relaxation is blunted in spontaneous preterm labor, a
dysfunction correlated with over-expression of S-nitrosoglutathione reductase. There is an unmet need to identify
the pathways driving quiescence during human gestation to develop new effective tocolytics.
Our central hypothesis is that Pezo1 stretch-activated channels exist in both the microvascular endothelium and
the uterine smooth muscle and both receptor pools coordinate gestational relaxation via stretch. Piezo1-
mediated nitric oxide generation in the endothelial cell compartment S-nitrosates the K+ channel TREK-1 in the
myocyte compartment. A Piezo1 agonist together with blockade of nitric oxide metabolism by inhibition of S-
nitrosoglutathione reductase to promote nitrosation, together with small molecule activation of TREK-1 will result
in additive potassium efflux that will reverse the dysfunctional relaxation of preterm tissues to NO donors.
This supplement project is proposed under the Nevada INBRE grant P20GM103440. The goal of the Nevada
INBRE is to enhance biomedical research infrastructure, research competitiveness, training and workforce
development throughout the state of Nevada. The specific focus area of the INBRE is growth and differentiation.
As a participating NIH IC, the NICHD seeks to fund the development of novel and effective pharmacotherapeutic
strategies to improve clinical outcomes for women and mothers. The goals of the Nevada INBRE and the NICHD
come together in the setting of fetal development in utero interrupted by spontaneous preterm labor leading to
preterm birth of an underdeveloped fetus. The research project described in this application is part of the
development of a future NIH COBRE Center program in women’s reproductive health research supported by the
Core services of the INBRE at the University of Nevada School of Medicine. Successfully exploring the research
described in this supplement request will provide data to support a full NIH R01 application to provide preclinical
evidence of effective combination tocolysis."

Despite a robust toolkit of prevention and treatment options, HIV incidence in the US stubbornly remains around 
39,000 cases per year. The reasons for this sustained, endemic spread of HIV are complex and interconnected, 
making it an inherently challenging area of scholarship whose success depends on team science, 
interdisciplinary approaches. It is precisely this kind of dynamic research environment that CFAR Scientific 
Working Groups (SWGs) are designed for, and the UNC CFAR will promote research supporting Ending the HIV 
Epidemic efforts through its North Carolina (NC) Collaborative HIV Epidemiology and Prevention (CHEP) SWG. 
This team builds upon the long-standing partnership between UNC CFAR consortium partners and the NC 
Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), applying epidemiological data at the intersection of 
biomedical and social sciences. 
The NC-CHEP SWG will bring together experts across disciplines and investigators new to HIV to share ideas 
and approaches, with the goal of fostering an academic environment conducive to thinking “outside the box.” 
Under a conceptual framework acknowledging the interconnected social, ecological, and clinical realities of HIV 
prevention and care, the NC-CHEP SWG aims to: (1) develop and refine resources for characterizing and 
exploring the HIV prevention and care continuum; (2) sponsor and support activities to bring together intra- and 
extramural expertise on basic, social, implementation, and prevention science to share perspectives and develop 
research ideas; and (3) identify, recruit, and mentor new and early career HIV investigators, highlighting the 
unique intersections among social science, basic science, and medicine within the HIV field.
To achieve these aims, the NC-CHEP SWG will: (1) update and curate a SWG membership directory and place 
it online; (2) meet with NC DHHS personnel to understand available data, any interval changes, and how to 
continue successfully working with NC DHHS data scientists and epidemiologists for data sharing; (3) work with 
the Clinical Core to expand the number of HIV-uninfected, at-risk individuals represented in the UNC CFAR HIV 
Clinical Cohort database; (4) initiate and direct work to characterize the prevention and care continuum in the 
context of the COVID-19 pandemic; (5) offer consistent, regularly scheduled programming with physical and 
virtual options to help members stay abreast of the “state of the science” in treatment and biomedical HIV 
prevention; (6) promote high-quality research ideas based on team science approaches through face-to-face 
and digital (asynchronous) peer review; (7) work with key faculty at UNC and our partners at historically Black 
colleges and universities to promote HIV science as a career path; and (8) increase the reach of the SWG 
members for disseminating their research by partnering with the state’s AIDS Education and Training Center to 
host webinars, work-in-progress talks, and virtual symposia."

10949380,"Project Summary/Abstract
Over 1 in 10 older adults is the victim of elder mistreatment. Rates of mistreatment are even higher
among older adults with dementia. Care of those with dementia often is the responsibility of unpaid family
and friends, with over 11 million unpaid caregivers providing support for individuals with Alzheimer's
disease and related dementias. While many caregivers report positive aspects of caring for their loved
one, it is also associated with increased burden and distress. Little research has examined the
phenomenon of elder mistreatment among individuals with dementia and their caregivers. The objectives
of this K01 project propose to create and validate a new measure of elder mistreatment, adapted to the
specific experiences of dementia caregivers and their care recipients. Such knowledge is necessary to
inform intervention and policy to reduce mistreatment among those with dementia and their caregivers.
Dr. Hancock will complete 5 training goals to enable him to become a successful, independent
researcher, capable of creating and validating new measures and designing and implementing
interventions. First, he will increase his knowledge and expertise in the fields of elder mistreatment and
dementia family caregiving. Second, he will develop the skills necessary to create a new measure,
translating from related research and soliciting and analyzing qualitative data from key stakeholder
interviews. Third, he will seek advanced quantitative training in the validation of newly created measures.
Fourth, he will obtain skills and knowledge necessary to translate research into an intervention and the
acquire the skills necessary to lead and run an NIH funded intervention project as PI. Fifth, he will develop
skills in independent grant writing and academic leadership. The two proposed research aims are
designed to complement the training goals. The first aim proposes to develop and refine a measure of
elder mistreatment among dementia family caregivers. Aim 1a will develop items and establish content
validity of a new measure of elder mistreatment, using feedback from key stakeholders including
caregivers and geriatric professionals. Aim 1b will pilot test the items generated in Aim 1a to inform
measure creation. Aim 2 proposes to validate the measure created in Aim 1. Aim 2a will seek to validate
the psychometrics properties of the newly created measure. Aim 2b will seek to examine prevalence and
incidence of elder mistreatment among dementia caregivers. Further, this sub-aim will seek to examine
correlates and predictors of mistreatment, to identify potential intervention targets to reduce mistreatment.
The proposed training plan and research proposal is well aligned with the NIA's initiative to develop and
train research scientists in aging. Moreover, it aligns with NIA's interests in promoting well-being, through
intervention, of dementia family caregivers. Finally, this proposal aligns with a recent funding
announcement which focuses on measurement of elder mistreatment."
10949494,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Whole-genome duplication (WGD) is increasingly appreciated as a defining moment for enabling chromosome
instability in solid tumors. This proposal investigates chemotherapy-induced WGD that promotes the formation
of polyploid cancer cells that appear senescent but in the absence of functional p53 are able to escape the
senescent state and generate heterogenous daughter cells. The focus on high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma
(HGSOC) derives from the urgent clinical need to improve therapy outcomes and the fact that p53 mutations are
the most prevalent genetic abnormality (≥90%) associated with aneuploidy in this malignancy. Polyploid cancer
cells exhibit a high level of plasticity and are thought to be a driving force in repopulating a tumor with highly
aggressive, therapy-resistant, metastasis-prone progeny. Currently, there is a gap in knowledge that connects
clinical descriptions of polyploid cells in tumor specimen with laboratory observations on the formation of
polyploid cancer cells. We hypothesize to close this gap through a CRISPR-Cas9 screen to identify genes that
are functionally necessary for formation of polyploid cancer cells and their daughter cells. We further hypothesize
that polyploid cancer cells in clinical specimen can be identified by their large polynuclear morphology and one
or more putative markers (cytoplasmic p21, acid ceramidase, VEGF-R2) resulting from an unbiased RNAseq
analysis. Our specific aims are to (1) Define essential genes for the polyploid lifecycle critical transition stages
and (2) to determine expression of putative markers of polyploid cancer cells in archived HGSOC samples. The
proposed studies will serve as the foundation for future larger mechanistic, drug development, or prognostic
studies with the potential to improve outcomes in ovarian cancer patients. An immediate impact will include
prioritizing patients for the angiogenesis inhibitor Bevacizumab, a common HGSOC option, which may work
better in VEGF-R2 expressing PGCC tumors. Of particular interest will also be therapeutic targeting of the
polyploid population through re-purposing of existing drugs that would be combined with neo-adjuvant
chemotherapy or used as a maintenance strategy following surgical debulking. Results obtained in HGSOC likely
have broader relevance, since polyploid cells are observed in many other solid malignancies."
10949915,"Despite aggressive medical therapy, over one-third of the world’s 70 million epilepsy patients suffer from uncontrolled seizures. Surgery and implantable devices can control seizures in many patients, but these treatments are only effective when targeted accurately. Currently, targeting is manual due to the lack of rigorous methods to quantify epileptic networks, and when these targets are identified, there is no rigorous way to select the best surgical approach. Consequently, therapy varies dramatically across centers and patients. There is a critical need for standardized, quantitative methods to map epileptic networks and to target and optimize therapy. My long-term goal is to develop these quantitative methods, create a scalable infrastructure to implement them at scale, and rigorously validate and translate these methods into clinical practice. My overall objective is to integrate non-invasive structural imaging, which provides a comprehensive anatomical view of the brain, with invasive IEEG that aims to pinpoint seizure origin and spread. I will develop rigorous, quantitative methods to map epileptic networks that cause seizures to guide epilepsy surgery. My central hypothesis is that patient outcome after epilepsy surgery depends on what percentage of abnormal regions quantified on neuroimaging and IEEG are removed. With this central hypothesis, I will develop tools for clinical translation by (1) developing standardized quantitative methods that generalize across epilepsy centers, (2) developing and validating new methods to integrate structural imaging and IEEG, (3) implementing methods to run at scale on a large number of patients, representing the diversity of epilepsy, across centers. In Aim 1, I will develop scalable methods to automate aggregation and multimodal analysis of structural imaging, IEEG, and clinical data from multiple epilepsy centers. In Aim 2, I will develop normative methods that merge structural imaging and IEEG data, to identify abnormal epileptic networks by comparing individual patient’s data with the norm. Undertaking Aims 1 and 2 during the K99 phase will enhance my proficiency in cloud computing, scalable analysis, multicenter biostatistics, and clinical translation. In Aim 3, I intend to implement quantitative methods to run at scale to predict surgical outcomes in two specific populations: patients with temporal and extratemporal lobe epilepsy. Multiple conceptual and technical innovations are embedded in this proposal to overcome translational barriers that limit generalization, rigorous validation, and scalability. These include innovative tools to scale analysis, novel personalized localization methods, collaborative validation, and data sharing across 15 US epilepsy centers. This work is significant because it merges state-of-the-art engineering, neurology, and neurosurgery to make practical tools to improve and standardize patient care by quantitatively guiding epilepsy surgery."
10951322,"Project Summary/Abstract
Quantification of drugs using the dried blood spots (DBS) remains uncommon due to the
challenges of variability of DBS samples and correlation of DBS drug levels with plasma drug
levels and clinical outcomes. In this proposal, we employ the volumetric absorptive
microsampling (VAMS) technique to collect DBS samples and use ultra-performance liquid
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to build a platform for quantitation of antimalarial
drugs, including lumefantrine, amodiaquine and its metabolite desethylamodiaquine, and
piperaquine, in the DBS samples. Then we will establish the correlation of DBS-plasma drug
concentrations. Considering the unequal distribution of drugs in erythrocytes and plasma, high
protein binding, and variable hematocrit, comprehensive regression models will be tested to
improve the accuracy of DBS-plasma conversion of drug concentrations. VAMS technique
enables precise sampling of micro-volume samples regardless of hematocrit. such as Mitra™
DBS devices collecting 10 µL blood and HemaPEN™ DBS devices collecting 2.74 µL blood
samples with precision and accuracy <5%. DBS microsampling can be carried out easily by
patients, requires less blood volume, and can be stored and transported at room temperature.
The novel VAMS DBS microsampling for sample collection combined with the highly sensitive
ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for drug quantitation, if
successfully validated, can be used as general methods to support pharmacokinetic/
pharmacodynamic studies in rural area where blood samples processing and cold storage are
impossible. We also expect an increasing application for pediatric patients due to its advantage
over traditional plasma samples. Finally, we will explore association of DBS drug exposure and
risk of malaria in comparison of the established association of plasma drug concentrations and
risk of malaria."
10946005,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease that results in demyelination and degeneration of
axons in the central nervous system (CNS). Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) occurs at an early stage
of MS and in the animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and is central to the initiation
and maintenance of MS pathogenesis by permitting leukocyte infiltration into the CNS. Recently, we made the
important discovery that when applied to pre-existing EAE disease, chronic mild hypoxia (CMH; 10% O2)
markedly accelerates neurological recovery, leading to long-term stable reductions in disability score.
Histologically, this protection correlated with reduced levels of vascular disruption and leukocyte accumulation
and faster remyelination. Mechanistically, CMH promoted a vigorous angiogenic response and increased
endothelial expression of tight junction proteins while reducing VCAM-1 expression, key indicators of enhanced
vascular integrity. In addition, CMH greatly enhanced apoptotic removal of infiltrated monocytes during disease
remission. Having recently found that hypoxia mimetics (HMs), drugs that stimulate hypoxia signaling pathways,
also accelerate neurological recovery from EAE, we now plan to extend these studies in two ways. First, by
defining a HM treatment protocol that optimizes recovery from EAE. Second, define mechanistically how
hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-mediated vascular remodeling and apoptosis of infiltrated monocytes contribute
to this protection. As MS onset typically occurs in young to middle-aged patients, we will study these events
both in young (10 weeks) and mature (8 months) mice. The goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that
HMs promote recovery from inflammatory demyelinating disease by enhancing vascular integrity and
suppressing neuroinflammation via HIF-mediated signaling.
 Our hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) define a HM protocol that optimizes recovery from
EAE, (2) evaluate the contribution of vascular remodeling to the hypoxia protective response in EAE, and (3)
evaluate the contribution of monocyte apoptosis to the hypoxia protective response in EAE.
 Building on our fundamental observation that CMH accelerates recovery from EAE and that the HM drug
FG-4592 exerts similar protection, both in the relapsing-remitting and chronic progressive EAE models, we now
plan to evaluate the translational potential of these findings by (i) defining an optimal FG-4592 treatment protocol
and (ii) define mechanistically how HIF-mediated vascular remodeling and apoptosis of infiltrated monocytes
contribute to this protection. Successful completion of these studies will further our goal of developing this
approach as a novel treatment for MS."
10946292,"Project Summary
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a severe public health problem. Limited FDA-approved pharmacotherapies exist
for AUD, and their efficacy is often insufficient. Therefore, development of new approaches for AUD treatment
is necessary. A large number of preclinical studies showed that administration of oxytocin (OXT) decreases
alcohol consumption in rodents. In clinical studies, intranasally administered (IN) OXT can also decrease
alcohol craving, alcohol cue reactivity and measures of heavy alcohol drinking. However, some recent studies
have reported lack of OXT's effects on measures of excessive alcohol drinking indicating the need for
developing more nuanced treatment approaches. Understanding mechanisms underlying OXT's effect on
alcohol intake may help the development of such approaches. IN-administered labelled OXT in non-human
primates was distributed along the olfactory and trigeminal nerves. Therefore, exogenously administered OXT
is likely to act along this route, with its potential first stage of actions in the anterior olfactory areas. Indeed, the
anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) and the main olfactory bulb (MOB) express high levels of OXT receptor
(OXTR) and the vasopressin receptor 1a (AVPR1a), respectively. We hypothesize, therefore, that activation of
these receptors in the anterior olfactory regions results in decreased alcohol consumption. The goal of this
exploratory project is to address this innovative hypothesis. This goal will be achieved in three specific aims. In
Aim 1, we will examine whether chemogenetic activation of OXTR-containing AON neurons can regulate
alcohol consumption in male and female mice. In Aim 2 we will examine whether chemogenetic activation of
AVPR1a-containing MOB neurons can regulate alcohol consumption in male and female mice. In Aim 3 we will
examine whether the anterior olfactory OXTR and AVPR1a contribute to OXT's inhibitory effects on alcohol
consumption in male and female mice through a region-selective conditional deletion of OXTR. Taken
together, these experiments will thoroughly test the role of anterior olfactory OXTR and AVPR1a in voluntary
alcohol drinking. On one hand, they will provide a background for a thorough investigation of mechanisms
involved in this role. On the other hand, they may provide a translational background for the potential of
targeting the olfactory systems in the treatment of AUD."
10946338,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Gastrointestinal (GI) problems are one of the most common concerns reported by families of autistic children
and youth and can have significant lifelong impacts on health, quality of life, and participation. Existing
research, however, primarily relies on parent report and is cross-sectional, leaving a gap in our understanding
of GI trajectories, i.e., how the symptoms emerge, including clinical and behavioral indicators; and how they
develop (and potentially change) over time. Further, existing research lacks standard approaches to measuring
GI symptoms; and a dearth of research using large, diverse, real-world clinical datasets limits our
understanding of which sub-groups are at higher risk of which constellation of symptoms, and what factors
predict response to standard of care treatments. The proposed multimethod research addresses these gaps by
using qualitative, participatory, and machine learning approaches to build prediction models of risk of GI
symptom profiles and response to treatment among autistic sub-groups. Our study aims to: (1) Qualitatively
describe autistic people’s GI experiences throughout the lifespan through analysis of narrative interviews with
25 autistic adults and 25 caregivers of autistic children/youth. (2) Quantitatively characterize GI symptom rates,
presentations, trajectories, and responses to treatment using electronic health records (EHRs) from Children’s
Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) (N=7,478 autistic children/youth ages 1 to 25) with both (a) structured data (e.g.,
diagnosis codes, prescriptions) and (b) unstructured data (i.e., keywords extracted from clinical notes via
natural language processing). (3) Build predictive models of risk of GI symptom profiles and response to
treatment using both traditional and machine learning approaches with the Aim 2 dataset and a matched
cohort of non-autistic children and youth (1:5). To ground our work in lived experience perspectives, and in
response to autism community advocacy for autistic representation in research, we will use a participatory
research approach with a community advisory board made up of (a) autistic adults and (b) caregivers of
autistic children and youth, who will contribute to data collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination.
The proposed study has the strong potential to contribute to a personalized medicine approach to GI disorders
for autistic people, including targeted risk assessments across the lifespan, to improve effective, person-
centered care."
10944920,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal malignancy projected to be the 2nd leading cause
of cancer-related deaths in the United States by 2030, with a dismal 5-year survival of 12%. PDAC is refractory
to standard chemotherapy and immunotherapy due to intrinsic and acquired resistance. Two key culprits
associated with therapeutic resistance are frequent infiltration of tumors by immunosuppressive innate immune
cells, particularly neutrophilic/granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (gMDSC), as well as pro-
inflammatory signaling by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), which dominate the non-tumor stroma and act
as cellular antennae to transmit inflammatory cues that further beckon gMDSCs to the tumor microenvironment
(TME). In dissecting the unifying mechanisms that underpin the relationship between these key constituents in
the TME and chemoimmunotherapy resistance, our data uncover novel signaling interactions between gMDSC-
derived transmembrane TNF (tmTNF) and TNFR2-expressing inflammatory CAFs in driving tumor-permissive
effects. Moreover, overexpression of TNF-TNFR2 signaling in human PDAC tumor transcriptomes is associated
with chemoimmunotherapy resistance across multiple datasets spanning diverse clinical settings.
 Building on these observations, the overall mission of this proposal is: (1) to mechanistically dissect the
pathogenic signaling and spatial interactions between gMDSC-tmTNF and CAF-TNFR2 governing
chemoimmunotherapy resistance in PDAC; and (2) catalyze preclinical development of a highly selective TNFR2
antagonistic antibody TY-101—which traps TNFR2 monomers and prevents assembly of signaling trimers—to
disrupt gMDSC-CAF crosstalk and overcome chemoimmunotherapy resistance in preclinical models.
 Aim 1 will define the precise contributions of gMDSC-tmTNF and CAF-TNFR2 signaling communication
and spatial interactions to chemoimmunotherapy resistance using innovative preclinical mouse knock-in/knock-
out modeling (murine) and single-cell spatial methodologies (human). Aim 2 will elucidate the molecular
mechanism by which gMDSC-CAF crosstalk regulates gMDSC-TNF production via cooperative MAP kinase and
STAT3 signaling. Moreover, we will also determine the functional significance of this cooperative gMDSC-TNF
mechanism on CAF polarization: a) in vivo using a tandem gMDSC depletion-adoptive transfer model; and b) in
human patients’ peripheral blood gMDSCs from subjects enrolled in a phase 1 clinical trial investigating MEK
and STAT3 inhibition in advanced PDAC. Finally, Aim 3 will determine if selective targeting of TNFR2 using TY-
101 improves sensitivity to chemoimmunotherapy by remodeling gMDSC-CAF spatial habitats and CAF plasticity
to prolong survival in vivo. Together, successful completion of these aims will uncover novel insights into the
tumor-permissive and tolerogenic role of myeloid-CAF crosstalk in the TME, as well as generate compelling
preclinical rationale and a compendium of novel predictive biomarkers for an upcoming clinical trial combining
neoadjuvant TNFR2 inhibition with chemoimmunotherapy in patients with operable PDAC at our institution."

Patients with advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have a poor prognosis, with a median overall
survival of ~18 months with standard-of-care (SOC) chemotherapy. However, overall survival can be extended
in such TNBC patients, albeit, modestly to ~25 months with a combination of SOC and immunotherapy, reflecting
the rationale that the immune system is an integral player in the overall anti-cancer response. In TNBC, the
immunotherapy, known as an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the PD-
1/PD-L1 axis in CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to sustain their effector function. A prerequisite for effective
ICI therapy is the availability of tumor antigens (Ags) which, in turn, are recognized by the Ag-specific CTLs. We
now know that a positive effect of certain chemotherapeutics on ICI efficacy is due in part to the availability of
‘neo-Ags’ recognized by CTLs. These neo-Ags are thought to derive from therapy-induced mutations or,
perhaps, to non-mutated determinants generated by post-translational protein modifications induced by
immunogenic cell death. However, chemotherapy can generate yet another type of non-mutated neo-Ag which
is currently overlooked. Chemotherapy mediates antitumor effects because cancer cells respond differently from
normal cells to DNA damage. These interventions damage not only DNA, but also RNA components of the
spliceosomes. Consequently, chemotherapy can be accompanied by a transient inhibition of splicing exposed
as widespread intron retention. The pattern of DNA damage-induced intron retention is recurrent and
reproducible in cells treated with the same chemotherapy. Translation of mRNA transcripts harboring retained
introns results in generating shared non-mutated neo-Ags encoded by intronic sequences. Differential responses
to chemotherapy-induced DNA damage manifested as repression of transcription for a set of cell replication-
related genes in normal cells, but not in cancer cells with p53 gene mutations, is frequently the case for TNBC.
This may result in generating cancer-specific, non-mutated neo-Ags encoded by retained introns. Some of these
novel intron-encoded sequences may contain immunogenic neo-epitopes that can be recognized by CTLs. Here,
we hypothesize that chemotherapy treatment of p53-mutant tumor cells generates novel ‘chemo-neoepitopes’
(CNEs), which can be identified and used as immunogens to mobilize new pools of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells.
Our rationale reflects the concept that the CNE peptide sequences would be completely new to the immune
system and would be capable of generating robust immune responses. In this proposal, we will identify candidate
CNE peptides in Aim 1, and then in Aim 2, determine their immunogenicity and the breadth of the induced CD8+
T cell repertoire. Immunizations that elicit a CD8+ T cell repertoire similar or identical to that induced by the
chemotherapy paradigm will suggest a novel CNE. Our long-term objectives are to increase the frequencies of
antitumor CD8+ CTLs and ICI efficacy in TNBC, a disease with still unmet clinical challenges."

Social drivers of health (SDoH) are the largest factors affecting our health and wellbeing but are difficult for
healthcare systems to address. The lack of healthy food, inadequate housing, and sparse social supports
disproportionately affect individuals burdened by health disparities, both exacerbating chronic conditions and
preventing people from receiving the care they need. The nearly 90 million Medicaid recipients are at
particularly high risk with overrepresentation of individuals vulnerable to health disparities, including those with
low or no income, racial or ethnic minorities, children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities.
Health systems face two problems when reaching beyond clinical care to improve patient health outcomes.
The first problem is one of identification; providers undercode social needs in existing schemas and ancillary
data collection methods such as social screens are not common, standardized, or easily shared. The second
problem is a lack of engagement between individuals and social services, which is especially frustrating since
there are many evidence-based practices that community-based organizations (CBOs) use to address social
needs. Our project will apply a precision medicine approach to the identification of, and engagement with,
Medicaid recipients with social needs. We will enhance the health information infrastructure of a managed care
organization that coordinates benefits for over 250,000 Maryland Medicaid members by:
● Developing and deploying a set of machine learning models that use multiple individual- and
 community-level data sources to predict which members use the emergency department to fulfill social or
 non-urgent needs as opposed to treatment for urgent medical conditions.
● Developing and deploying an engagement support system that identifies and displays the characteristics of
 members that are predicted to prevent them from engaging with a CBO.
● Implementing a continuous qualitative and quantitative improvement process that identifies recurring
 themes and disengagement points in cases where members did not complete their social intervention.
The study team is well positioned to develop a social needs intervention protocol and will include rigorous
evaluations to assess the effects of our intervention on the health and social outcomes of participating
members by their demographic and geographic characteristics. Together, our Aims will help identify and
address social needs and shrink disparities in health outcomes across a large, high-risk population."

T cell-based immune therapies are a promising approach to treat cancer. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is
one such therapy developed by engineering a protein comprised of a tumor recognition motif, a T cell major
signaling molecule, and costimulatory molecules. Engineered T cells expressing CAR (CAR-T cells) have shown
remarkable clinical success in treating B cell malignancies, but their efficacy in controlling solid tumors is
limited. The major hurdle to T cell treatments is overcoming their chronic stimulation and CAR-T cell
exhaustion. Chronic T cell activation induces oxidative stress and accumulation of stress granules (SG). SG are
subcellular cytoplasmic compartments that contain RNA-binding proteins and translationally repressed
mRNAs. Significant progress has been made in understanding the components of the SG core and uncovering
the therapeutic potential of SG regulators in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the functional
role of the T cell SG network in T cell exhaustion and the mechanistic link between the SG core and CAR-T cell
exhaustion are completely unknown. We propose to test the hypothesis that augmentation of the SG
regulatory network leads to CAR-T cell exhaustion. Using our recently devised CAR construct with a
fluorescence reporter to track SG assembly and maintenance in living cells, we will analyze the SG dynamics of
activated and exhausted CAR-T cells when the SG core regulator, G3BP1, is downregulated. We will measure
how effective the G3BP1-downregulated CAR-T cells are in controlling tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo to
determine if the G3BP1 downregulation improves CAR-T function and longevity. Next, we will target upstream
metabolic stress regulators to test whether CAR-T cell function improves when metabolic stress regulators are
deficient. Our innovative proposal to explore the T cell SG network, the translational regulators of metabolic
stress as regulatory targets to improve CAR-T cell longevity, and the mechanistic tie between the SG network
and CAR-T cell addresses a critical gap in the field. This project is expected to provide novel insights into an
unexplored area of T cell biology that will not only spur a better understanding of this process but will facilitate
the development of novel cancer therapeutics."

Overcoming the burden of tobacco use among Latinos demands innovative, effective, accessible, culturally
appropriate, and community-engaged solutions. Over the past eight years, in partnership with the Latinos Contra
el Tabaco (Spanish for: Latinos Against Tobacco) Community Advisory Board (CAB), our team has developed
Decídetexto, the first culturally-accommodated smoking cessation text messaging intervention for Latinos
(available in English and Spanish). Our recently completed randomized controlled trial (RCT; n=457)
demonstrated that Latinos receiving the Decídetexto intervention were significantly more likely than those
receiving standard of care (smoking cessation printed materials) to be smoking abstinent at Month 6 (34.1% vs
20.6%; p<0.001). Despite the proven efficacy of Decídetexto among Latinos, we did not address the fact that
75% of participants did not meet the recommended levels of physical activity [at least 150 minutes of moderate
to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per week]. Moreover, we did not leverage the potential role of physical
activity in enhancing cessation rates despite evidence suggesting that MVPA may enhance cessation rates.
Thus, we developed Actívatexto, an innovative mobile intervention that incorporates physical activity into the
Decídetexto intervention. Specifically, Actívatexto integrates four components: 1) a text messaging program that
promotes both smoking cessation and physical activity, 2) wearable devices to monitor physical activity, 3)
smoking cessation pharmacotherapy (i.e., nicotine replacement therapies), and 4) an online dashboard where
the research team manages participants’ incoming and outgoing data from both the text messaging program and
wearable devices. Pilot tested among Latinos who smoke and do not meet the recommended levels of physical
activity (n=20), Actívatexto generated high satisfaction, increased minutes of MVPA per week, and resulted in
noteworthy cessation rates (70% of participants were smoking abstinent at Month 3). Our multidisciplinary team
is uniquely poised to conduct the first comprehensive research effort to study the synergism of smoking cessation
and physical activity in a mobile intervention among Latinos. We will use a hybrid type I effectiveness-
implementation research design to assess the efficacy of Actívatexto and the barriers and facilitators of its
implementation. Specific aims are: Aim 1. Assess the efficacy of Actívatexto, a mobile intervention that promotes
both smoking cessation and physical activity, compared to a mobile intervention that solely promotes smoking
cessation, on smoking abstinence at Month 6 among Latinos. Aim 2. Assess physical activity, self-efficacy, and
perceived stress as mediators of the presumed treatment effect on cotinine-verified 7-day point prevalence
abstinence at Month 6 among Latinos. Aim 3. Examine the barriers and facilitators to implement Actívatexto
among Latinos."

Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) combines supervised exercise, risk factor modification, and psychosocial support in
a structured program that may lower cardiovascular morbidity, mortality, and healthcare spending in selected
patients with cardiovascular disease. Yet only 1 in 4 eligible patients in the U.S. receives CR, with marked
disparities by sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic level, and rurality. Barriers to uptake include uncertainty of
long-term benefit among clinicians and patients, limited availability of local CR facilities, and high out-of-pocket
costs. Most randomized clinical trials of CR in the U.S. did not enroll diverse populations, were too small to
evaluate heterogeneity, and could not examine long-term outcomes. Moreover, major advances in
cardiovascular therapies – such as transcatheter valve replacement or new treatments for heart failure – may
have altered the effectiveness of CR, limiting the generalizability of past trial data. Observational analyses of
real-world data may provide contemporary insights, but commonly used statistical methods are challenged by
immortal time bias and confounding, particularly when treatments, like CR, need to be sustained over time.
This project applies novel causal inference methods that have been specifically developed to address these
limitations to large, diverse datasets incorporating administrative claims, electronic health records, and a
cardiovascular registry, all linked with national health system and community-level socioeconomic data. Aim 1
will evaluate the effectiveness of CR in diverse populations of Medicare, Veterans Health Affairs, and
commercial insurance beneficiaries. It will use the target trial framework (which uses observational data to
emulate the hypothetical trial that would definitively answer the research question of interest) and quasi-
experimental designs (which exploit random variation in CR use). It will examine both in-person and virtual CR,
the uptake of which has increased since the COVID-19 pandemic. Aim 2 will examine individual-level
variability in response to CR using novel risk score- and effect score-based analyses to derive personalized
estimates of treatment benefit. The final validated score-based model will be used to develop an online tool so
that clinicians can incorporate this information into shared decision-making regarding CR use. Aim 3 will use
time-driven activity-based costing to estimate the cost of delivering in-person or virtual CR, and use nationally
representative simulation models to evaluate the population health benefit and cost-effectiveness of CR.
IMPACT: This research, which will be the largest and most comprehensive contemporary evaluation of CR in
the U.S., will directly address key knowledge gaps identified by the Centers for Disease Control's Million
Hearts Initiative. Our multidisciplinary team will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of CR in diverse
populations to increase evidence-based CR uptake, produce personalized estimates of treatment benefit to
facilitate shared decision-making, and project long-term cost-effectiveness to stimulate strategic investments
needed to enhance equitable access to this underutilized guideline-directed therapy."

The goal of this project is to establish a pharmacokinetic model for absolute quantification of pulmonary
perfusion and microvascular parameters and validate this model in large animal models with independent tissue
analyses of perfusion, vascular permeability, and pathological features. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a
progressive and ultimately fatal disease with highly variable clinical courses and poorly understood pathogenic
mechanisms. Accumulating evidence shows that abnormalities in the pulmonary endothelium set off a cascade
of events that promote increased vascular permeability, fibroblast activation, and excessive extracellular matrix
deposition, ultimately leading to the development of fibrotic lung tissue and impaired lung function. However,
the changes in the pulmonary endothelium of the fibrotic lung have not been well defined. Dynamic contrast-
enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) is a powerful imaging technique whereby the kinetics of an intravenous contrast bolus
such as the FDA-approved agent Gd-DOTA can be modeled for quantitative measurement of tissue perfusion
and vascular permeability. Accurate assessment of these changes in IPF will provide an improved
understanding of the pathophysiology of pulmonary fibrosis, which is valuable for improving patient care and
facilitating drug development for this deadly disease. Previously, we demonstrated that DCE-MRI with model-
free analysis allows for indirect but sensitive detection of alterations in perfusion, permeability, or extracellular
extravascular volume in patients with IPF or prior COVID infection compared to healthy volunteers, thus providing
in vivo regional functional information not otherwise available. However, the pathophysiological interpretation of
these results remains to be elucidated because the model-free approach indirectly measures a collective effect
of changes in perfusion and microvascular parameters. The standard pharmacokinetic model in common use
for DCE-MRI, Tofts model, is oversimplified, assuming instantaneous intercompartmental water exchange and
negligible blood volume which are not valid for the lung and thus propagates into significant systematic errors in
physiological parameters extracted from DCE data. To overcome these challenges, I propose to extend the
standard Tofts model to encompass intercompartmental water exchange rate and true compartmental fractions
for DCE-MRI of the lung and validate the physiological measurements derived from this extended model with
independent tissue analyses in a large animal model of IPF. The output of this project will be a robust analytical
tool for absolute quantification of pulmonary perfusion and microvascular parameters in the lung, which will not
only provide a quantitative understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanism underlying IPF and other
pulmonary diseases but also be valuable for improving patient care and facilitating drug development for this
deadly disease."

 Computations reveal valuable information about organic reactions including those catalyzed by transition
metals. Organic chemists can map out potential energy surfaces using density functional theory (DFT) and gain
insight into the mechanism of a transformation. Using transition state theory, the reactivity and selectivity of a
reaction can be explained by these studies. However, reactions with selectivity that cannot be explained by
energy calculations performed with DFT may require the use of quasi-classical molecular dynamics simulations.
 One transformation where this type of modeling is vital is in the Michael addition and nickel cross-couplings
using Watson's pyridinium salts. Despite the best experimental efforts, the Michael addition forms many
byproducts in addition to product and the nickel cross-coupling gives only byproduct. The aim of this project is
to study the dynamic behavior of alkyl radicals from a series of pyridinium salts and use this knowledge to enable
reaction design. While the barrier computed by DFT for the alkyl radical to undergo Michael addition is lower in
energy than recombination with the pyridine, a greater amount of byproduct is observed experimentally. This
lack of agreement between DFT calculations and experiments points to a need for modeling of dynamic effects.
I propose that the generation of the alkyl radical via C–N bond breaking of the pyridinium salt is an ambimodal
transition state, which does not follow the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) pathway to the alkyl radical but
rather recombines with the pyridine, forming byproduct instead of the statistically favored product. I propose that
the nature of the pyridine substitution pattern will affect the distribution of products, with more electron-withdrawn
pyridines favoring radical addition. After verifying that more electron-rich, sterically hindered pyridines will favor
productive reaction, the escape of the alkyl radical from the solvent cage will be modeled. A detailed
understanding of the lifetime of the alkyl radical in solvents of varying polarity is needed, with the hypothesis
being that more polar solvent leads to a more stable radical which is more likely to undergo further chemistry.
This study is accessible solely through molecular dynamics simulations, an underexplored area that is vital to
reaction design in systems with ambimodal transition states. Using the training and information gained in this
study, in the R00 phase, I will develop chemistry to expand on existing methods of three-component coupling
processes of C-aryl glycosides in which molecular complexity can rapidly be generated from a simple scaffold.
These methods are vital to future drug design with the goal of lowering drug cost by simplifying the synthetic
pathway to access certain drugs as well as using earth-abundant metals like nickel and iron in the R00 phase."

Our research has shown a link between poor sleep health and late circadian timing with cardiometabolic
dysfunction in adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Further, sleep health and circadian timing of adolescents
with T1D participating in our research was markedly poor compared to age-based recommendations.
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in T1D, which begins as early as
adolescence, and current therapies are limited. Thus, it is imperative to identify countermeasures, such as sleep
health and circadian timing, to improve cardiometabolic health in adolescents with T1D. Our central hypothesis
is that that cardiometabolic dysfunction associated with T1D can be reduced by improving sleep health and
circadian timing. We have successfully increased sleep duration and advanced circadian timing with a combined
behavioral and physiological intervention in adolescents without T1D. Simultaneously intervening on sleep health
and circadian timing may reverse cardiometabolic dysfunction but a gap exists with no research in adolescents
with T1D. Further, no research to date has examined the physiological mechanisms underlying the relationship
between sleep health and circadian timing and cardiometabolic dysfunction in adolescents with T1D.
We therefore propose to utilize a combined sleep health and circadian timing intervention as a mechanistic probe
to understand relationships with cardiometabolic health in adolescents with T1D. Utilizing a randomized clinical
trial design and a combined free-living and in-laboratory paradigm, we will compare the effect of 1 month of
optimally-timed, low-dose PM melatonin and AM bright light exposure plus increased time in bed to an attention-
matched control condition in adolescents with T1D. We will evaluate changes in insulin resistance, glycemic
control, and vascular functioning using rigorous assessment methods, and determine physiological mechanisms.
We hypothesize that insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, and vascular function will improve with a combined
sleep and circadian intervention, and that inflammation, cortisol, and leptin will act as mediators. This proposal
will provide an understanding of mechanisms underlying the relationship between sleep health and circadian
timing and cardiometabolic dysfunction in adolescents with T1D which is urgently needed as a first step towards
developing new therapies to mitigate CVD in T1D."

 The overarching objective of this project is to develop an advanced computational super-resolution model to
enhance the throughput and resolution of chemical imaging. Chemical imaging, which includes advanced
techniques such as stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy, holds immense potential in intraoperative
cancer detection. This is due to its ability to generate intrinsic molecular contrasts without tissue processing or
labeling, which can improve the accuracy and speed of intraoperative diagnosis. Such improvement is crucial to
better patient outcomes by providing near real-time feedback to the surgeon and reducing the risk of leftover
cancerous tissues. However, existing chemical imaging techniques grapple with an inherent limitation – the
tradeoff between spatial resolution and imaging field of view, resulting in low imaging throughput and prolonged
imaging durations for larger tissue samples. For other applications involving live cell imaging, the limited
resolution of SRS (> 300nm) hinders visualization of subcellular organelles and fine structures.
 Computational super-resolution, bolstered by advancements in artificial intelligence, can address these
challenges by transforming low-resolution images into high-resolution versions. This has been achieved with the
Convolutional Neural Network and the Generative Adversarial Network. However, super-resolution chemical
imaging is scarce. There are no datasets available for super-resolution training. It is also unclear whether existing
super-resolution microscopy techniques could work for chemical images due to vast differences in imaging
contrasts. Here we propose to develop a new super-resolution technique ChemDiffuse that is based on the
diffusion-based deep generative network. Diffusion-based models are widely used in popular image-generation
tools such as Midjourney and DALL-E. While superior in stability and image quality to CNN and GAN models,
they need extensive training data. Leveraging on our recent progress in image augmentation and a new diffusion
model for 2D and 3D data, we will develop the ChemDiffuse model to significantly improve SRS imaging
throughput and resolution. We aim to test the application of the ChemDiffuse super-resolution model in two
different areas: 1. Fast gigapixel SRS imaging of tissue at submicron resolution for pathology application. We
will use mouse brain tissue as our test system to train the ChemDiffuse model to enable fast 3D SRS imaging at
10 million pixels/sec, a 40-fold improvement in lateral dimension, and another 10-fold improvement in axial
dimensional. Such improvement is crucial for intraoperative stimulated Raman histology of large tissues. 2.
Label-free SRS imaging of live cell organelles at 150 nm resolution. We will train the super-resolution model to
enable 2-fold resolution enhancement with regular SRS imaging, an improvement that will allow unprecedented
label-free tracking of multiple organelles and single cell analysis for a wide range of drug discovery applications.
Though our focus is on SRS imaging, this methodology can benefit various other chemical imaging techniques,
including Raman microscopy, IR imaging, transient absorption microscopy, and photothermal microscopy, etc."

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have emerged as breakthrough treatments for patients with hematologic
malignancies, earning 12 approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2017. Experimental
CAR T cell therapies have also demonstrated complete remissions in solid tumors, and the FDA is projecting to
grant 10-15 approvals per year by 2025, highlighting the potential of these ‘living therapies’. Despite this, current
CAR T cell designs have not yet mediated sustained efficacy in solid tumors, and only 30-50% of B cell leukemia
and lymphoma patients experience long-term disease control. To develop safe and potent next-generation CAR
T cell therapies, it is critical to understand why existing CAR T cells succeed or fail in patients. As a scientist
trained in both experimental and computational immuno-oncology, I have chosen to focus my career on using a
systems biology approach to uncover the molecular mechanisms governing efficacy of engineered T cell
immunotherapies. This proposal outlines a structured 2-year training plan and a comprehensive 5-year career
development program to complete my training and launch an independent research career. My specific research
goals are: (1) to define the most therapeutically relevant CAR T cell subsets in patients with large B cell
lymphoma (LBCL), and (2) to overcome an immune suppression mechanism of resistance to CAR T cell therapy
for LBCL. First, I will follow individual CAR T cell clones through time in patients treated for LBCL using matched
single-cell sequencing of transcriptome, a panel of surface proteins, and endogenous T cell receptors (Aim 1).
This approach, termed reverse fate mapping, will pinpoint T cell clones in the pre-manufacture apheresis and
infusion products with sought-after properties, including abilities to expand, persist, and home to the tumor. In
Aim 2, I will apply reverse fate mapping and methylation analyses to identify the origin of circulating CAR T
regulatory (Treg) cells that I recently linked to limited CAR T cell efficacy in LBCL. In Aim 3, I will mechanistically
dissect the interplay between Treg and non-Treg CAR T cells to design a potent ‘Treg-free’ CAR T cell therapy for
clinical evaluation. My work will generate a comprehensive CAR T cell atlas and insights, leading to promising
avenues for engineering the next-generation CAR T cell therapies. The results of my proposed research will
positively impact public health, as they will gather sufficient preliminary data for testing a ‘Treg-free’ CD19-CAR T
cell therapy for LBCL in a clinical trial and will deliver fundamental insights into CAR Treg biology that may
generalize to other diseases, including solid tumors, where engineered T cell therapies have not manifested
similarly potent effects as in LBCL. To build upon my skills, I have assembled a mentorship team, including my
primary mentor, Dr. Crystal Mackall, a pioneer in CAR T cell immunotherapies; co-mentor, Dr. Sylvia Plevritis, a
leader in cancer systems biology; and an advisory committee with extensive expertise relevant to all aspects of
this proposal. The completion of this K99/R00 program will prepare me to compete for R01 funding and to launch
an independent research career focused on improving immunotherapies for patient with cancer."

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) among never-smokers is on the rise. Mutations in the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) gene are common and found in >50% of lung tumors from never-smokers. While EGFR-
mutant tumors exhibit robust responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, disease progression is unfortunately
inevitable. Many patients with Stage IV NSCLC now experience durable responses and long-term survival
following treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. However, such benefits are rarely seen in patients with EGFR-
mutant disease, where rapid disease progression is frequently observed. The poor responses to checkpoint
inhibitors in EGFR-mutant NSCLCs are likely due to their immunosuppressed “cold” tumor microenvironment
(TME), characterized by low levels of infiltrating CD8+ and CD4+ T cells and high levels of regulatory T cells
(Tregs) and M2 macrophages. An unmet need exists to elucidate the factors that contribute to the
immunosuppressed TME and develop efficacious immunotherapeutic regimens for patients with EGFR-mutant
NSCLC. Emerging data suggest estrogen contributes to an immunosuppressive TME. Data from other cancer
types demonstrate the ability of 17β-estradiol (E2) to regulate several immune cell types, including CD8+ T cells,
Foxp3+ Tregs, macrophages, and neutrophils. Although it is well established that estrogen and its reactive
metabolite 4-hydroxyestrogen (4-OHE) play an important role in lung tumorigenesis, little attention has been
given to their contribution to immunosuppression in the lung TME or the use of estrogen-modulating agents to
attenuate these effects. Preliminary data from our group demonstrate for the first time that administration of an
aromatase inhibitor (AI) to mutEGFRL858R mice significantly increases intra-tumoral CD8+ T cell infiltration and
promotes anti-tumor effects. Furthermore, our new data are the first to demonstrate that: 1) deletion of CYP1B1
(enzyme responsible for 4-OHE production) in mutEGFRL858R mice reduces lung tumor burden by ~50%; 2) 4-
OHE production is significantly enhanced in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC as compared to healthy controls;
and 3) 4-OHEs polarize macrophages to the immunosuppressive M2 phenotype, an immune species known to
be enriched in EGFR-mutant tumors. These novel data provide strong rationale for investigating the use of an
AI with anti-PD1 therapy in EGFR-mutant NSCLC. The proposed multidisciplinary research will involve studies
in the mouse models of mutEGFRL858R and delEGFRΔL747–S752 lung adenocarcinoma (Aim 1), complemented by
immune biomarker analyses using archived specimens from patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC (Aim 2).
Research under both aims will be performed in parallel, to facilitate rapid translation of the resulting data to a
clinical setting and selection of the patient population that will benefit most from an estrogen modulator. Findings
will enhance our understanding of the contribution of estrogen and its metabolites to immunosuppression in the
TME of EGFR-mutant NSCLCs, and inform the design of a novel clinical trial that employs an AI with a checkpoint
inhibitor to improve long-term survival."

Thirty percent of epilepsy patients have seizures despite best medical therapy. Continued seizures and
polypharmacy are associated with poor quality of life. While epilepsy surgery has emerged as a promising
treatment for these patients, surgical outcomes have not significantly improved over the years. These stagnant
outcomes can be attributed to poor seizure onset zone (SOZ) and epileptic network (EN) localization with
currently available tools. Epilepsy as a disease of energy metabolism has emerged as a relatively novel concept
with several studies suggesting upregulation of lactate within epileptic brain. Using patient tissue and epilepsy
models, our lab recently showed that when neurons are chronically activated, they begin to use glycolysis as a
primary means of cellular energy metabolism, thus upregulating the production of lactate. Furthermore, we
recently introduced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of hyperpolarized (HP) 13C pyruvate as a novel imaging
tool to spatially and temporally localize its downstream metabolic products, including lactate, in glioma and
traumatic brain injury. In this proposal we combine this novel technology with our previous findings of elevated
lactate production in epileptic tissue to explore hyperpolarized 13C MRI (hpMRI) as a means to identify epileptic
tissue. Our overarching hypothesis is that hpMRI of pyruvate will accurately identify elevated lactate production
in a rat model of focal epilepsy and in resected epileptic tissue ex vivo. In our first Aim we will use a lithium
pilocarpine rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy to explore the ability o f[1-13C]pyruvate hpMRI to identify elevated
lactate in vivo. In our second Aim, we will determine if MRS of HP [1-13C]pyruvate is able to identify elevated
lactate in resected human epileptic tissue ex vivo. These data will provide the pre-clinical evidence necessary
for a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of 13C hpMRI as a tool to identify epileptic tissue in patients."

Angiogenesis is required for proper development of the embryonic circulatory system and is an important step
in the progression of many eye diseases, including retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Therefore, understanding
how the normal regulatory mechanisms in the retina keep angiogenesis in check has great clinical implications.
We recently showed global deletion of Bim, a proapoptotic member of Bcl-2 family of proteins, protects the
developing retinal vasculature from hyperoxia–mediated vessel obliteration and ischemia-mediated
neovascularization in the preclinical mouse model of ROP, the oxygen-induced ischemia retinopathy (OIR)
model. In addition, we showed that targeted deletion of Bim in retinal endothelial cells, pericytes or astrocytes
does not protect the developing retinal vasculature from exposure to hyperoxia–mediated vessel obliteration or
from ischemia-mediated neovascularization. These results strongly support an important role for Bim expression
in retinal inner neurons in proper regulation of developing retinal vasculature. Our hypothesis is that Bim
expression in retinal neurons plays a central role in deriving the sensitivity of developing retinal vasculature to
hyperoxia–mediated vessel obliteration and ischemia–mediated retinal neovascularization during ROP. In Aim
1, we will determine the contribution of Bim expression in the inner retinal neurons to hyperoxia-induced vascular
damage. In Aim 2, we will determine the contribution of VEGF expression in the inner retinal neurons to
hyperoxia-induced vascular damage. Understanding how Bim expression in retinal neurons regulates retinal
vascular development and enhanced sensitivity to hyperoxia will provide insight into Bim mechanisms of action
and aid in the development of alternative ways to modulate retinal angiogenesis."

Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2 (BMP2) is a growth factor that is essential for osteogenesis, increases osteoblast

of patients to BMP2 shows several side effects and BMP2 is not very effective as a treatment.
We recently identified the interaction of Casein Kinase II (CK2) with the BMP Receptor Type Ia (BMPRIa). We
developed a peptide, namely CK2.3, that releases CK2 from the receptor and activates BMP2 signaling in the
absence of BMP2. CK2.3 is more specific compared to BMP2 by activating only a subset of the BMP2 signaling
pathways. Knockout of BMPRIa by CRISPR/CAS, demonstrates that CK2.3 signals through BMPRIa. CK2.3
specifically induces bone formation by driving osteogenesis and increasing osteoblast activity while decreasing
osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activity.
BMP2 signaling is aberrant in osteoblasts from patients diagnosed with Osteoporosis (POP). Osteoblasts or
explants isolated from femoral heads of POP do not respond to BMP2 by increasing markers for osteoblast
activity and mineralization. However, CK2.3 treatment of osteoblasts from POP leads to an increase in
mineralization. At the same time CK2.3 decreases osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activity. The goal of this
proposal is to determine the cause of the lack of responsiveness of osteoblasts to BMP2 while they still respond
to CK2.3. Osteoblasts from POP overexpress BMPRIa, followed by downregulation after BMP2 stimulation.
However, the BMP2 signaling pathway downstream of the receptor is not activated. These data suggest that the
problem is localized to BMPRIa shuttling on the plasma membrane, degradation, or recycling. Since CK2.3 acts
through BMPRIa and still activates the signaling pathway, we will define the role of CK2.3 in overcoming the lack
in BMPRIa signaling. BMP2 is an essential growth factor in osteogenesis and bone formation. Understanding
the pathways identified in this proposal is crucial to define new dogmas in bone biology and develop new
successful treatments for bone diseases. Further, CK2.3 by itself may be a potential therapeutic."
10951373,"Access to mental health care is a fundamental human right that should be a critical performance metric for all
governments and healthcare systems. However, there are few psychometrically evaluated measures of access,
especially for low-and-middle income countries. Theoretically informed, culturally grounded, and psychometrically
sound access metrics are needed to hold governments and healthcare systems accountable for making mental health
services accessible to all people, and to help design and evaluate new programs and policies focused on improving
access. This proposed project is a collaboration between investigators at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria and the
University of Washington in the United States. The project has two major objectives. The first objective is to develop
and psychometrically evaluate a metric of perceived access to mental health care that is cultural appropriate for Nigeria.
The second objective is to enhance the research capacity of early-state global mental health researchers in Nigeria. The
proposed research activities include three specific aims. For Specific Aim #1, we will conduct in-depth qualitative
interviews with patients with depression and/or anxiety living in Ibadan, Nigeria, along with their caregivers and
clinicians, to identify common impactful barriers that prevent or delay people from receiving needed care. Qualitative
research with the intended population is needed to ensure that the perceived access metric contains items about
barriers that are relevant for the population. However, because not all barriers to mental healthcare are modifiable, we
will need to divide barriers into two groups: 1) access barriers and 2) non-access barriers (i.e., attitudinal and need
barriers). For Specific Aim #2, we will obtain consensus from health providers and policy makers regarding the
modifiability of the identified barriers by healthcare systems and/or ministries of health. Once the access barriers are
identified, we will generate items to include in the perceived access metric and then revise them using cognitive
interviews with patients. Working with patients to first identify barriers and then providers and policy makers to
determine which barriers are modifiable will optimize the content validity of the access metric. For Specific Aim #3, we
will conduct a survey with 250 patients with depression and/or anxiety to assess the critical psychometric properties of
reliability, construct validity and cross-cultural validity. At the conclusion of the proposed research, we will have a
patient-centered metric of perceived access that is ready to use for policy evaluations, quality improvement, and
research. With valid and reliable metrics of access, gaps and inequities in access can be detected and the impact of
policies and programs designed to enhance access and address disparities can be meaningfully evaluated. The proposed
research is closely aligned with NIMH’s Strategic Plan Goal 4 (Objectives 4.1 and 4.3). Specifically, the access metric can
be used to test the mechanism of actions for interventions designed to engage hard to reach patients in effective mental
health treatments. The proposed research is also responsive to World Health Organization’s Mental Health Action Plan
that has a focus on health disparities with the following objective: “Proactively identify and provide appropriate support
for groups at particular risk of mental illness who have poor access to services.”"
10950409,"PROJECT SUMMARY
As the demand for data-intensive, interdisciplinary research increases, so does the demand for quantitative
scientists who excel not only at working with data but also at collaborating effectively within research teams
across all fields of medicine. Despite the integral role that quantitative scientists play on these teams, they
typically receive very basic, if any, targeted team science training during their graduate studies or in the
workplace. We propose the creation of the Quantitative Team Science (QuanTS) Program to provide scalable
methods for training and mentoring quantitative scientists who are currently working within the biomedical
research community, to foster the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors inherent to effective team science.
Relying on our team’s past work, our innovative approach focuses on competencies and skills that are specific
to quantitative team scientists. We will first create a series of online educational modules to train quantitative
team scientists in ten key collaborative skills. These modules, including both didactic training materials and an
accompanying mentor guide, are designed to be asynchronous and self-paced, allowing for a flexible,
accessible, and sustainable modality that can be easily scaled and utilized by a broad range of learners. Next,
we will implement a small-group, synchronous mentorship program for quantitative team scientists to gain
more experiential training and focused mentorship in ten key collaborative skills. In this seven-month program,
participants will benefit from a three-pronged mentorship approach including program mentorship, peer
mentorship, and home institution mentorship. Throughout the development and deployment of the online
educational modules and the focused mentorship program, we will integrate a mixed-methods evaluation
process that examines the facilitators, barriers, and outcomes of the QuanTS Program in practice, including
examining changes for quantitative scientists, their mentors, and their domain collaborators as a result of the
program. This will provide directly actionable information to inform processes for sustaining/expanding the
QuanTS Program and will also provide guidance for future quantitative team science trainings. The
comprehensive QuanTS Program will grow the workforce of highly-skilled quantitative team scientists who can
integrate diverse scientific perspectives into data analyses, communicate results to a range of audiences, and
cultivate positive interpersonal relationships within the biomedical research environment. Quantitative scientists
are integrated within research teams across all disciplines and phases of biomedical research. Improving the
way in which quantitative scientists collaborate with biomedical investigators (e.g., clinicians, bench scientists,
domain experts) to conduct interdisciplinary research not only enhances the efficiency and rigor of data
analyses but also holds the potential to accelerate the translation of research findings into tangible clinical
applications, thereby advancing the frontiers of medical knowledge and patient care."
10950537,"Project Summary/Abstract
A core function of the human brain is object recognition, which underlies many higher-order functions like memory
and emotion. Deficits in recognizing objects are associated with various neurological disorders, such as visual
agnosia, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s disease. However, the neural mechanisms for object recognition remain
elusive. Specifically, little is known about how the brain translates visual inputs of objects into meaningful
semantics. Previous studies have proposed a hierarchical neural network for object processing, critically
including the visual temporal cortex (VTC) and the downstream medial temporal lobe (MTL). While recent single-
neuron studies in non-human primates evidenced an axis-based visual feature encoding in the VTC, human MTL
neurons have long been characterized to carry a sparse and selective code for individual exemplars (exemplar-
based coding). Yet the process by which visual feature representations in the VTC are transformed into semantic
representations of abstract labels in the MTL remains unknown.
This project aims to address this question by examining the neural computations and dynamics within the VTC-
MTL neural network during object recognition. We will utilize intracranial recordings at both individual neuron and
neural-circuit levels across different brain areas, coupled with sophisticated computational algorithms. Three
distinct neural coding models will be surveyed across the VTC and MTL, including the axis-based feature model,
the exemplar-based model, and the region-based feature model (a novel model proposed in our recent studies;
K99 AIM 1). VTC-MTL interactions and dynamics that are critical to object recognition will be identified (K99 and
R00 AIM 2). The derived results and analysis pipeline from the K99 phase will then be utilized to investigate how
different neural models transition from one to another along the VTC-MTL pathway to achieve the representation
transformation (R00 phase). The central hypothesis is that different coding models are employed at different
stages of object processing, and the novel region-based feature coding serves as an intermediate step that
bridges the axis-based coding in the VTC and the exemplar-based coding in the MTL.
This proposal will be conducted at Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL), a top-rank research university
that offers excellent scientific support and career training. A team of established mentors will provide necessary
training in: iEEG data recording and analysis (Drs. Brunner and Willie), inter-areal interaction analyses (Dr.
Rutishauser), neural networks and cognitive neuroscience more broadly (Dr. Hershey), computational modeling
and statistics (Dr. Wang), and career development (all mentors). While the primary aims of this proposal is to
provide new insights into object recognition in humans across multiple scales, the anticipated outcomes have
the potential to inspire new therapeutic interventions for disorders involving impaired object recognition. This K99
award will critically facilitate the success of the proposed research and the applicant’s transition to independence.

Project Summary
 We aim to develop a daily temperature model on 30m road segments for all roads in the
contiguous United States from 2000 to 2020. We will use satellite data, land use features,
elevation, etc. as predictors in a stacked machine learning approach which will be trained on tens
of thousands of weather stations to estimate hyperlocal predictions. We will in turn use this model
to identify urban heat islands, hot and cold spots, and identify populations most vulnerable to sub-
optimal temperature exposure. This model will be made publicly available to all stakeholders
including community members, researchers, and policy makers to help examine and address
structural environmental injustice in exposure to temperature and its health effects.
 Next, we will use this exposure data in epidemiological studies to see whether short- and
long-term temperature exposures are associated with health outcomes using causal modeling
and mixtures approaches. We will conduct a case-crossover analysis looking at short-term
exposures and geocoded deaths in thirteen US states (to residence in most states and census
block groups in the rest). For long-term exposure, we will use a variation of a causal difference-
in-difference model which can account for both measured and unmeasured confounding between
spatial units over time to assess how changes in area-level temperature affect changes in rates
of morbidity and mortality. This will be followed up by a grouped weighted quantile sum approach
which can group correlated exposures and identify their joint effects as a mixture as well as the
contribution of each individual component. We will look at several simultaneous mixtures: climate
exposures, air pollution exposures, and socioeconomic exposures.
 Finally, we will conduct extensive sensitivity and subgroup analyses. We will use negative
controls assure that associations are not due to confounding. We will correct for measurement
error using regression calibration, stratified by state and season. We will examine how the
associations are modified by race/ethnicity, poverty, measures of social vulnerability and
deprivation, and land use characteristics. Our morbidity data includes all state in-patient data and
emergency department visits from several states across years. This allows us to examine the
effects of temperature on non-fatal outcomes across the life span. Our large population-based
datasets ensure that we will have enough power to detect associations in our subgroup and
stratified analyses. This project will greatly enhance our understanding of the full health effects of
exposure to temperature in numerous population groups using causal methodology and mixtures
approaches."
10945054,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), commonly driven by KRAS mutations, is responsible for 7% of all cancer
mortality. LUAD predominantly arises from alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, which function as facultative alveolar stem
cells by self-renewing and replacing alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells. The first allele-specific KRAS inhibitors (KRASi)
were recently approved in LUAD, but clinical benefit is limited by intrinsic and acquired resistance. Histologic
transformation of LUAD to squamous cell cancer (adenosquamous transition, AST) has been reported as a form
of acquired resistance to KRASi. Such cancer cell state transitions are emerging as central mechanisms of
resistance to oncologic therapies. Importantly, they are not associated with acquired genetic events but are
driven by epigenetic reprogramming and transcriptional re-wiring of cellular differentiation programs. To meet
the challenge of treatment resistance in the clinic, identifying and targeting cell states that confer resistance to
KRAS inhibitors must be sought with urgency. We used genetically engineered mouse models, patient-derived
xenografts and organoids, and patient samples to identify LUAD differentiation states that drive resistance to
KRASi. We found KRASi promote a quiescent AT1-like cancer cell state in LUAD tumors. The AT1-like LUAD
cells exhibit high growth potential upon treatment cessation, whereas ablation of the AT1-like cells sensitizes
tumors to KRASi and robustly improves treatment response. Notably, targeting KRAS in LUAD tumors harboring
mutations in STK11, encoding the LKB1 tumor suppressor, invariably leads to histologic transformation into AST
that is resistant to KRASi. These findings implicate genetically deterministic differentiation programs as key
drivers of resistance to KRASi in lung cancer, whereby LKB1-proficient cancer cells adopt an AT1-like state and
LKB1-deficient cells undergo a squamous transformation. We hypothesize targeting either the AT1-like or the
squamous transition state, informed by LKB1status, will overcome resistance to KRASi in LUAD. To address
this hypothesis, we will (i) investigate the origin and fate of the alveolar/squamous states in tumors using lineage-
tracing; (ii) model outcomes of cytoablative therapies targeting the AT1-like/squamous states utilizing lineage-
ablation; (iii) uncover molecular cell state drivers and evaluate them as targets in the context of LKB1 proficiency
or deficiency. To do this, we will take advantage of novel genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of
KRAS(G12D) or KRAS(G12C) mutant LUAD that we have developed. We validate our findings in human patient-
derived tissues and xenografts. Our proposed study will allow us to establish the AT1-like and squamous
transition states (i) as LKB1 genotype-specific biomarkers of intrinsic resistance and relapse potential in LUAD
and (ii) as targets for cytoablative therapies to overcome resistance to KRASi, as well as to identify molecular
drivers of these cell states. Thus, this work will elucidate novel cellular and molecular mechanisms of response
to KRAS-targeted therapy and inform strategies to overcome treatment resistance in LUAD patients."

The prevention of HIV in the United States is in a transformational era. In just a decade since the first finding of
efficacy for daily oral PrEP, there is a proliferation of new PrEP agents, including long-acting injectable PrEP,
and regimens, including “event-driven” (also called 2-1-1) PrEP. There has also been new knowledge about the
impact of antiretrovirals (ARVs) for treatment of HIV, and an emergent understanding that people living with HIV
who take ARVs and maintain a suppressed viral load are incapable of transmitting HIV to their sexual partners.
In this context, the idea of “protected” sex – which historically meant sex protected by condoms – has become
much more complex. To understand men’s preferences for prevention products and strategies and what choices
are being made by men with varying risk profiles, we will enroll a prospective cohort of 1275 of men who have
sex with men (MSM) in Atlanta, Detroit and San Diego and follow the cohort for two years. Each participant will
have 8 quarterly quantitative assessments, including discreet choice experiments; a subset of MSM will be
engaged in a qualitative assessments (focus group discussions and individual in-depth interviews) to help with
message development and refinement. HIV and STI testing will be provided in alternating 6-month windows.
Rapid reporting of results will produce actionable reports following each assessment wave. This project will
serve as a dynamic source of data about the evolving patterns of use and preference for PrEP among MSM."

PROJECT SUMMARY
lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. Among the various breast
cancer subtypes, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) carries the worst prognosis and only 11% TNBC patients
with distal metastasis are expected to survive beyond 5 years. Furthermore, current therapies for TNBC also
provide marginal and in most cases only short-term clinical benefits. Therefore, novel and more efficacious drugs
for TNBC treatment are in urgent need. Most epithelial cells are dependent upon contacts with the extracellular
matrix (ECM) for survival and undergo apoptosis when they lose contact with the ECM, a process termed anoikis.
However, tumor cells, upon detachment from the ECM, are capable of evading anoikis. The acquisition of anoikis
resistance is a critical step that contributes prominently to TNBC tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, anoikis
inducers represent valuable therapeutic targets for TNBC treatment. However, the molecular drivers of anoikis
resistance that can be therapeutically targeted in TNBC remain largely unknown. Protein kinases are excellent
drug targets with over 25 drugs targeting kinases are approved by US FDA for treating a wide-variety of cancers
in clinic. Therefore, to identify kinases that confer anoikis resistance in TNBC cells, we performed a kinome-wide
shRNA screen and identified the PDZ Binding Kinase (PBK) as a driver of anoikis resistance in TNBC cells. We
found that PBK was overexpressed in TNBC and predicted poor prognosis. Furthermore, genetic or
pharmacological inhibition of PBK induced anoikis in TNBC cells. Based on these results, we hypothesize that
PBK confers anoikis resistance to drive TNBC tumor growth and metastasis. The overall objective is to determine
the in vivo role of PBK in TNBC tumor growth and metastasis and evaluate pharmacological targeting of PBK for
TNBC therapy. Aim 1 studies will determine the in vivo role of PBK as a driver of TNBC tumor growth and
metastasis. First, using mammary fat-pad injection-based orthotopic mouse model of TNBC tumor growth and
metastasis we will determine if genetic inhibition of PBK suppresses TNBC tumor growth and metastasis. We
will also measure circulating tumor cell (CTC) load in vivo in this mouse model to monitor the effect of PBK
inhibition on anoikis induction in vivo. Next, based on our preliminary results, we will test the role of PBK-
dependent phosphorylation of transcription factor TWIST1 in reprogramming TNBC cells to acquire
mesenchymal cell state and thereby acquiring anoikis resistance. Aim 2 studies will ascertain the efficacy of PBK
inhibitor in vivo for TNBC treatment. To do so, we will determine if a highly-potent and efficacious PBK inhibitor,
OTS-964 can effectively suppress TNBC tumor growth and metastasis utilizing established TNBC cell lines, and
patient-derived xenografts (PDXs)-based models. Taken together, our findings will have strong scientific impact
by establishing a novel role of PBK in driving cell state regulatory pathway that facilitate TNBC tumor growth and
metastasis as well as by establishing PBK targeting as an effective approach for treating TNBC."
10945983,"ABSTRACT
One of the most astonishing feats in all of biology is the process by which chromatin, the complex of DNA,
histone proteins and associated factors, becomes compacted from a length of 2 m into nuclei that measure just
microns across. Unsurprisingly, our understanding of the principles that govern this process is in its infancy. My
lab became interested in this process after we identified the Ferguson-Bonni ANAPC7 neurodevelopmental
syndrome caused by mutation of the degradative ubiquitin ligase Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC). We
discovered that Ki-67 was the major APC7-dependent target in post-mitotic neurons, where it accumulated in
constitutive heterochromatin. Subsequent experiments in complementary mouse mutants demonstrated a much
broader role for the APC in regulating the composition of neuronal heterochromatin, where we also observed
dramatic accumulation of the chromosome passenger complex (CPC) and its product phosphorylated histone 3
(H3S10ph). Like Ki-67, the contributions of the CPC and H3S10ph to neurologic disease had been previously
unknown. Although these observations established an APC-dependent ubiquitination-phosphoprotein axis in
neurodevelopmental chromatin regulation, how Ki-67 and H3S10ph control heterochromatin remained poorly
defined. We hypothesize that Ki-67 and H3S10ph control liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), a
physicochemical process driven by multivalent interactions of disordered proteins like Ki-67 and phosphoproteins
like H3S10ph. Studies from other labs showed that LLPS of constitutive heterochromatin requires the small
protein HP1α, which interacts with Ki-67. Data from my lab showed that neuronal Ki-67 undergoes rapid
relocalization away from heterochromatin upon disruption of LLPS, indicating Ki-67’s association with constitutive
heterochromatin requires LLPS. This compelling series of observations leads us to the central hypothesis of this
proposal: LLPS of heterochromatin-associated APC targets is required for neurodevelopment and when
perturbed contributes to the pathogenesis of APC-related neurodevelopmental disorders. In Aim 1, we will
explore the role of Ki-67 in the formation of heterochromatin in neurons using imaging and molecular analyses
of a novel mouse model of Ki-67 mutation. In Aim 2, we will employ elegant in vitro assays to determine how Ki-
67 enhances LLPS of HP1α and nucleosome arrays. In Aim 3, we will explore the liquid-like behavior of APC
substrates Ki-67 and the CPC by imaging heterochromatin dynamics in live neurons. Armed with novel in vivo
genetic systems, powerful in vitro assays, and world-class expertise in the wet lab and computational methods,
we are poised to generate fundamental insight into chromatin regulation by ubiquitin and LLPS in neurons."
10945582,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Nearly a third of pregnant patients in the US undergo induction of labor with oxytocin. Despite it being a
commonly used medication on Labor & Delivery units around the world, we have a limited understanding of how
to dose oxytocin effectively during labor induction as evidenced by its variable therapeutic index and high failure
rate of almost 30%. Exposure to high doses of oxytocin for long periods of time is associated with maternal and
neonatal morbidity. When there is abnormal labor progression during an induction, the current standard of care
is to titrate oxytocin to reach adequate contractions, defined as Montevideo units (MVU) >200 assessed via an
intrauterine pressure catheter (IUPC). The theoretic pathway for oxytocin administration is that it increases
maternal serum oxytocin, activating the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) and generating adequate contractions.
However, we lack mechanistic understanding of how this pathway is affected by oxytocin dosing and our current
definition for adequate contractility is flawed as recent data suggest that MVU is an imprecise predictor of
induction success. In this proposal, we test the hypothesis that our strategy for assessing contraction adequacy
can be improved by using contraction parameters other than MVU, such as peak pressure, duration, frequency,
and area under the curve. We will also test the hypothesis that contraction adequacy is associated with maternal
serum oxytocin concentration and that myometrial OXTR function is affected by dose and duration of oxytocin.
To test these hypotheses, we propose a prospective cohort study of universal IUPC placement in 605 patients
undergoing labor induction to develop a prediction model for completion of the first stage of labor using
contraction measures and accounting for oxytocin response (Aim 1). We will collect serial maternal serum in a
subset of 84 patients from Aim 1 to correlate serum oxytocin concentrations with contraction measures (Aim 2).
We will also assess myometrial OXTR function, expression, and localization as it relates to dose and duration of
oxytocin exposure (Aim 3). The results of this clinical and translational study will provide mechanistic
understanding of how pregnant patients physiologically and functionally respond to exogenous oxytocin so that
we may ultimately titrate oxytocin to optimize labor induction success and reduce maternal and fetal morbidity."

 Adolescence is most strikingly characterized by the pubertal growth spurt. It is also a time when the
prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders increases dramatically, a fact reflected in the widespread use of
antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In fact, antidepressants comprise
the second to third most commonly prescribed medication class in this age group.
 We and others have found that SSRIs are associated with height growth suppression in adolescents. This
was particularly true in boys undergoing puberty. To build on these findings, we recently completed another
study (R21HD097776) of children and adolescents undergoing puberty and starting treatment with one of two
commonly prescribed SSRIs, sertraline and fluoxetine. We again found that, over the 6-month follow-up period,
the higher the SSRI dose, the more significant height growth suppression was. In fact, SSRI use reduced growth
by about 50% of that observed in unmedicated participants. Notably, sertraline was associated with the most
significant deleterious effect on height. Moreover, the higher the SSRI dose, the lower the serum concentration
level of insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1), the principal marker of growth hormone (GH) neurosecretory function.
 To better characterize the clinical implications of these findings, we now propose to 1) determine whether
the suppression of height growth and IGF-1 plateaus or continues unabated over the course of a 2-year follow-
up, 2) whether differences between the 4 most prescribed SSRIs (sertraline, fluoxetine, citalopram, and
escitalopram) exist, and 3) whether SSRI treatment merely slows growth down or, rather, stunts it, thus reducing
anticipated adult height. The latter will be evaluated using serial assessments of bone age.
 In sum, the proposed study will be the first to investigate the magnitude of height growth suppression induced
by SSRIs, its clinical predictors, and its long-term sequelae, shedding light on a currently little-recognized side
effect of a widely and increasingly used medication class. The information will be critical to informing clinical
decision making."
10944724,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mammalian genomes are organized into loops and topologically associated domains by the cohesin protein
complex. The formation of these structures has suggested models for how DNA regulatory elements, such as
enhancers and promoters, are spatially arranged to coordinate gene expression. However, testing these models
and their implications in cellular function and fate has been challenging due to the lack of systems for
interrogating the activity of cohesin in vivo. Using mouse olfactory sensory neurons and serotonergic neurons
from the raphe nuclei, post-mitotic cells in which the role of cohesin in genome function can be uncoupled from
its role in sister chromatin cohesion, we recently uncovered that cohesin and its unloader WAPL play a critical
role in the development of the central nervous system by regulating the expression of clustered Protocadherin
(Pcdh) genes. In this proposal, we aim to leverage the Pcdh gene cluster as a new paradigm to study the
molecular underpinnings of cohesin activity and its dynamics in governing the generation of neuronal cell surface
diversity during brain development. Specifically, we propose to understand the role of auxiliary proteins to the
cohesin complex in regulating cohesin dynamics and Pcdh gene expression in vivo. Finally, we aim to link the
molecular operations of cohesin and its protein regulators to neural wiring and neural circuit assembly. The
findings from our proposed studies are poised to generate new hypotheses for how genome architecture is
coupled to gene expression in mammalian cells. They will provide an unprecedented view of neural wiring across
scales, linking cell-type-specific regulation of genome structure to neural wiring during brain development.
Finally, they will generate insights into developmental and intellectual disorders known as cohesinopathies,
where dysregulation of the Pcdh genes is linked to improper cohesin actions."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is an important public health challenge associated with significant morbidity, mortality,
and increased healthcare costs. Low-income populations are 2.5 times more likely to have T2D and experience a
disproportionate burden of poor health outcomes. Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support (DSMES)
is an evidence-based program recommended for every person newly diagnosed with T2D with proven efficacy
for improving health behaviors and outcomes. However, <5% of low-income individuals with T2D engage in
DSMES within the first year of diagnosis, further exacerbating disparities. Multilevel and multidimensional
barriers contribute to DSMES underutilization in this high-risk population, and these must be considered in
order to promote health equity. Digital health interventions show promise for increasing access, uptake, and
relevance of health promotion interventions among underserved communities where the ubiquitous nature of
cell phones can also be leveraged to enhance engagement. To our knowledge, there are no digital health
interventions tailored to low-income people newly diagnosed with T2D in the US. The first year of diagnosis is a
critical window for establishing and sustaining self-management behaviors that promote health across the
lifespan. This K99/R00 proposal is guided by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities
Research Framework to support research, mentorship, training, and community-engagement activities that will
foster the growth and trajectory of an early-stage health equity scholar focused on improving T2D-related health
among low-income populations. The K99 research goal is to co-create a user-informed, digitally enhanced
DSMES tailored to the education and support needs of low-income adults newly diagnosed with T2D. The R00
research goal is to establish the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of the intervention in a Federally
Qualified Community Health Center on engagement in DSMES, changes in self-management behaviors, and
improvements in health outcomes (A1c, weight, and quality of life). The proposed research sets the stage for a
full-scale R01 that will test the efficacy of the digitally enhanced DSMES intervention to improve health outcomes
among low-income patients newly diagnosed with T2D. The PI has established a transdisciplinary mentorship
team of NIH-funded health disparity scholars and a comprehensive training plan guided by an individual
development plan to expand her skills, knowledge, and professional network to support a career focused on
advancing health equity through accessible, sustainable, and scalable system-level interventions for underserved
populations. The applicant’s long-term goal is to become an independent, NIH-funded scientist with a research
program focused on developing and implementing community-informed, culturally- and contextually relevant
interventions that improve diabetes-related health outcomes among underserved populations."
10950478,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Antibiotic resistant bacteria pose a global threat to human health and wellbeing. New strategies for
combating resistance are urgently needed because current drug development pipelines are not keeping up
with the dwindling supply of effective antibiotics. I propose to investigate and manipulate the ecology of
antibiotic resistance acquisition and host-to-host transmission. Specifically, I will determine how the physical
structure of bacterial communities within the intestine—which is a major reservoir of antibiotic resistant
bacteria—affects the evolution of resistance traits and transmission of resistant cells. A motivation for this
research direction is that antibiotic resistance fundamentally dependends on the spatial and temporal
organization of host–microbe systems. For example, the sharing of resistance genes between bacteria
through lateral gene transfer often requires cells to be in close proximity to one another. In addition, the
transmission of resistant bacteria between hosts requires that they are physically displaced and expelled into
the environment. Thus, altering the spatiotemporal organization of gut bacterial communities could be used
to prevent and contain resistant bacteria before they become agents of infection. However, dissecting the
spatially and temporally complex mechanisms governing antibiotic resistance is a significant challenge using
current approaches. My solution to overcome this limitation is to combine synthetic biology, genetically
engineered bacterial communities, and live imaging to track and control bacterial behavior inside the
intestines of living animals. I will employ larval zebrafish as a vertebrate host model because they enable
studies of host–microbe systems across scales of complexity, space, and time that are difficult to perform in
mice or humans. Using this experimental approach, I previously discovered that intestinal flow, bacterial
swimming motility, and sublethal antibiotics represent host, bacterial, and environmental factors, respectively,
that can modulate the spatiotemporal organization and physiological landscape of gut bacteria. I will harness
these factors and my experimental approach to address the following three hypotheses. First, I will test the
hypothesis that the spatiotemporal organization of gut bacteria controls the acquisition and persistence of
resistance traits within the intestine. Second, I will test the hypothesis that the spatiotemporal organization of
gut bacteria regulates the transmission of antibiotic resistant cells between hosts. And third, I will test the
hypothesis that bacteria coordinate both the acquisition of resistance traits and host-to-host transmission
through specific genetic pathways. My proposed research has the potential to inspire ecology-based
strategies for curtailing antibiotic resistance through the therapeutic manipulation of the intestinal
microbiome’s physical structure. Such ecology-informed and antibiotic-free strategies would preserve the
potency of current antibiotics for when they are needed most and avoid the unintended side effects of
antibiotics on beneficial resident bacteria."
10950492,"ABSTRACT. This REVISED collaborative R01 application addresses the impact of cytomegalovirus (CMV) on
the gastrointestinal mucosa in chronic HIV infection. We hypothesize that CMV infection contributes to the
intestinal barrier dysfunction and consequent immune activation that persist in chronic HIV infection despite
suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). In Aim 1, based on strong preliminary studies, we hypothesize that
CMV persistence in the gastrointestinal tract results in part from the failure of CMV-specific CD8+ T-cells to
localize to this tissue. To determine the breadth and functionality of CMV-specific T-cell responses in gut, we will
measure responses in colorectal tissue from participants in the SCOPE cohort at UCSF. To determine the effects
of CMV infection on antigen presentation in gut, we will employ the rhesus macaque model of CMV (RhCMV)
and SIVmac to study interactions between mucosal dendritic cells (DC) and T-cells ex vivo. In Aim 2, we will
leverage an externally-funded clinical trial (AIDS Clinical Trials Group Study #A5383) to directly test the
hypothesis that asymptomatic CMV replication contributes significantly to microbial translocation in treated HIV
disease. We will determine the effects of suppression of CMV replication with letermovir on systemic biomarkers
of microbial translocation as well as immune activation and gut barrier integrity assessed directly in gut mucosal
tissues. Taken together, these studies will determine the contributions of CMV to immune activation in HIV
disease, and the mechanistic bases for these effects. Aim 3 leverages a second ACTG study (#A5355) to
determine whether a modified vaccine Ankara (MVA)-based CMV vaccine can increase systemic and/or gut-
homing and mucosal CMV-specific T-cell responses in treated HIV infection. Failure of a therapeutic anti-CMV
vaccine to elicit gut-homing CMV-specific T-cell responses and to reduce mucosal CMV shedding may
compromise its ability to reduce systemic immune activation in treated HIV infection and would highlight the need
for optimization of vaccination strategies to improve mucosal responses. (Note: Aims 2 and 3 do not meet the
NIH definition of a clinical trial; the ancillary studies in these Aims only add additional measures to pre-existing
trials)."
10950526,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The increasing pool of older individuals in the U.S. population who can develop late-onset systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) and longer life expectancy for younger SLE patients will likely result in a dramatic
increase in the numbers of older SLE patients over the next 20 years. The complex interactions of altered
immunity, stress, and morbidity from long-standing chronic disease potentially put all SLE patients—regardless
of age—at risk for functional impairments, which are generally associated with the aged population. But there
is some evidence that even relatively young SLE patients have reported perceived physical and cognitive
functional impairment. In a recently completed pilot study (n=60) ancillary to the ongoing Georgians Organized
Against Lupus (GOAL) cohort, we performed detailed, in-person assessments of physical and cognitive
functioning. We found that levels of physical and cognitive performance, self-reported physical functioning,
independence in activities of daily living, falls, and community mobility were similar to, or worse than, those
seen in older non-SLE populations. These results suggest that a novel, geriatric approach to care may be
beneficial in SLE. To begin to address this goal, we first need to better characterize the burden of impairment
of physical and cognitive functioning in a real-world SLE population, in order to determine what resources may
be needed to support SLE patients’ functioning as they age, and for which patients these resources are most
needed. Furthermore, understanding the relative contributions of age, disease activity, cumulative organ
damage, inflammation, and other patient characteristics to impairment in the setting of SLE will help to identify
patients most likely to be impaired and target population-level interventions to reduce risk associated with poor
functioning. Finally, understanding how impairment affects health outcomes in this population will assist with
risk stratification and prevention of costly care, by providing information on the most predictive functioning
measures among patients with SLE. GOAL, with its rich, existing longitudinal data and ongoing, population-
based, diverse cohort of SLE patients, provides a unique opportunity to address these gaps. Our study aims to:
(i) assess the burden and patterns of physical and cognitive dysfunction across age groups in a cohort of 450
SLE patients; (ii) identify patient risk factors for impairment in physical and cognitive functioning; and (iii)
estimate associations of functioning measures with outcomes utilizing secondary and linked data. We will
estimate the prevalence of dysfunction on multiple physical and cognitive functioning domains among GOAL
patients, overall and by age, using validated instruments. We will then estimate associations of functioning with
sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and measured inflammatory markers, overall and by age group.
Finally, GOAL data and its linkage of administrative data can be leveraged to examine associations of
functioning parameters with quality of life, depression, work/disability status, mortality, and severe morbidity,
including hospitalization and progression to end-stage renal disease."

 Dr. Melanie Molina is an Assistant Clinical Professor of Emergency Medicine at the University of California,
San Francisco (UCSF) whose long-term goal is to become an independent investigator studying how to
leverage health information technology to improve care for patients experiencing social disadvantage. To
achieve this goal, she will develop critical skills in clinical informatics, human-centered design, and
implementation science by: 1) completing formal coursework in SQL and Clarity data model fundamentals,
human-centered design, and designing individual-level implementation strategies, 2) attending structured
didactics, research group meetings, journal clubs, and works-in-progress sessions, and 3) performing goal-
directed training activities in data query, retrieval, and analysis, contextual inquiry and focus group design, and
intervention implementation and pilot data collection. The research infrastructure and resources at UCSF,
including the Center for Clinical Informatics and Improvement Research and the Clinical and Translational
Science Institute, will provide Dr. Molina with all the support necessary to complete the work proposed in her
career development application. Dr. Molina has assembled an exceptional mentorship team: Dr. Laura Gottlieb
(primary mentor) is a Professor of Family and Community Medicine with expertise in social determinants of
health, Dr. Julia Adler-Milstein (co-mentor) is a Professor of Medicine and Chief of the Division of Clinical
Informatics with expertise in electronic health record (EHR) data, and Dr. Courtney Lyles (co-mentor) is a
Professor in the Department of Public Health Sciences at UC Davis with expertise in human-centered design
and implementation science methodologies.
 The overarching goal of this proposal is to integrate patient social risk information into an existing EHR-
based clinical decision support (CDS) tool to facilitate ED-initiated, social risk-informed opioid use disorder
(OUD) medication treatment and ultimately improve treatment adherence and follow up. Dr. Molina will start by
extracting metadata from Epic’s reporting database capturing whether discrete social risk data were
documented and/or reviewed by ED clinicians for OUD-related ED encounters (Aim 1). Using insights from Aim
1—in addition to a human-centered design approach with semi-structured qualitative interviews of key ED staff
and patient stakeholders—she will integrate patient social risks into an existing CDS tool for OUD treatment,
creating a prototype that provides social care-enhanced OUD treatment recommendations (Aim 2). She will
then evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the social care-enhanced CDS tool at the UCSF ED as an
intervention to increase treatment adherence and follow up using a mixed-methods, before-after approach
(Aim 3). This proposal fulfills the National Institute of Drug Abuse research priority of understanding how to
adapt existing services into more patient-centered models of care."
10951196,"The major goal of this project is to analyze baseline data on and samples from a community that will soon
undergo transformative neighborhood level sanitation infrastructure improvements. The study team is
leveraging preliminary funding to collect data and samples in 2024, but funding for sample analysis is not
available. Infrastructure improvements in Quelimane, Mozambique a cholera-endemic city of 420,000, will be
transformative, as ~20% of people in the city currently practice open defecation. We will leverage this imminent
major infrastructure project – funded by the World Bank and serving 200,000 people – to assess its impacts on
child health, disease transmission, and climate resilience, toward a better understanding of the cost-benefit of
such investments. Safe sanitation is considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the 20th
Century, but three billion people still lack improved sanitation infrastructure. Pathogens in fecal wastes reach the
environment through well-understood pathways, yet evidence for the impact of city-wide sanitation in low-
income urban settings is largely uncharacterized. Rigorous controlled studies of city-wide interventions are
difficult to carry out, as it is often infeasible to randomize and challenging to find opportunities to collect
preliminary data immediately before implementation of a project. This unique opportunity will allow us to
overcome many of these challenges by collecting and analyzing baseline data prior to initiation of
construction of the neighborhood wide sanitation intervention. We will map the urban, informal
neighborhoods in the city and collect baseline data on demographic information, water and sanitation access,
and household conditions and behaviors to establish a robust baseline for young children in future intervention
and matched comparison areas. In a subset of 200 households, we will collect household environmental samples
including domestic soils and synanthropic flies (SA1) and in 600 households we will also measure anthropometry
and collect biological samples from children from one month to five years of age to measure baseline markers
of child health and development (SA2). We propose to analyze environmental and stool samples for
enteropathogens using state-of-the-art molecular methods (SA1 + SA2). This transformational sanitation
intervention is a unique, natural experiment that will allow our team to characterize the living conditions,
exposure risks, and infection rates of children living in low-income neighborhoods in Quelimane, to establish a
robust baseline for future impact analyses, while also understanding the relationship between these factors under
current conditions. Our multidisciplinary research team has decades of experience conducting field studies of
enteric diseases and impact evaluations of water and sanitation interventions in low-income settings, and
specifically in Mozambique. This work elucidating the potential health impacts of community-sanitation
interventions in Quelimane will serve as a model for other highly urbanizing, coastal tropical or subtropical
cities with high vulnerability to climate and extreme weather globally."
10951179,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Remote trials (aka “virtual trials” or “decentralized trials”), in which patients receive treatment and provide
study data without the need to travel to a clinic or medical center, have emerged as a promising approach for
enhancing clinical trial efficiency. However, evidence for the hypothesized benefits of remote trials is weak,
consisting primarily of anecdotal reports, uncontrolled studies, and expert opinion. The same is true for
hypothesized challenges and limitations of remote trials, including concerns about technological barriers and
multiple aspects of trial quality. Clearly, a stronger evidence base is needed to evaluate the impact of remote
trials on the “quality and efficiency of translational research, particularly multisite trials” (CTSA Goal 4).
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for comparing treatments – and, by extension, for
testing the impact of remote methods on trial efficiency and quality. Accordingly, we propose an innovative,
rigorous experimental evaluation of remote vs. in-person methods on trial efficiency (accrual) and quality
(retention, treatment adherence, bio-specimen completion rates), across 3 RCTs on 3 different use cases: a
larger, multi-site demonstration trial of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation at the Buffalo and UPenn hubs
in the UG3 Phase and two smaller, single-site dissemination projects in the UH3 Phase (a mHealth
intervention for people with depressive symptoms at the MUSC hub; an opioid overdose education and
naloxone intervention at the UAB hub). These trials will use a harmonized design and outcomes and follow
participants through 3-month follow-up. Results from these 3 RCTs will be analyzed jointly to assess the degree
to which the findings for remote vs. in-person trial methods generalize across conditions and treatment
modalities. We will also explore whether use of remote versus in-person methods differentially impacts
representation and retention among under-represented groups facing health disparities. The proposed series of
RCTs is significant and novel in its ability to advance our understanding of the impact of remote approaches on
clinical trial efficiency and rigor. The quantitative, qualitative, and cost data generated from this project will
establish a translational science evidence base which will guide the design of future clinical trials. Additional
dissemination efforts (e.g., project website, webinar series, conference presentations, publications, newsletters
and press releases, and a national workshop) will target the CTSA consortium and clinical trialist community at
large."
10951184,"Every year ~100,000 young people in the US develop a first episode of psychosis and more than one million
have attenuated psychotic symptoms such as problems in perception, thinking and communication, which are
suggestive of a clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. These symptoms appear during critical periods in brain
development and have important ramifications for current and future function and morbidity. Of note, prior clinical
trials have not been successful in preventing psychosis onset, or other non-psychosis outcomes. There are many
reasons why. One is that clinical trials have been small, which is especially problematic given that attenuated
symptoms are heterogeneous, and stratification into meaningful subgroups requires large samples. Another
issue is that most clinical trials have not been mechanistic, due to a dearth of validated and robust biomarkers
for psychosis risk, and for other clinically important outcomes, such as mood and substance disorders, suicidal
ideation and behavior, persistent motivational/hedonic deficits and further functional decline. Prior investigations
have also not included standardized data protocols across studies. In response to these challenges, in 2020, the
NIMH launched the Accelerated Medicines Partnership® Schizophrenia (AMP® SCZ) project, a large,
observational study designed to de-risk the drug development process through validation of drug development
tools, including biomarkers related to cognition, brain structure and function, fluid biomarkers, genetic
vulnerability and communication. Investigators in the current proposal led the Data Processing, Analysis and
Coordination Center (DPACC) for the AMP SCZ project to manage and coordinate data from the clinical
networks, overseeing all aspects of data flow, quality assurance, processing, and analysis. The current proposal
is in response to RFA-MH-24-151, the next phase of the AMP SCZ project, to perform Proof of Principle (PoP)
clinical trials utilizing Phase 2 ready compounds to target pathophysiologically relevant mechanisms that have
the potential to produce a detectable signal (change) in biological, digital, cognitive, or clinical outcome measures
within a 12-16 week period of study. We propose the Clinical Trial DPACC (CT-DPACC) to provide executive
management, direction, and overall coordination, including data processing and analyses of data for the PoP
trial(s). We will maintain the current research team and organizational structure and augment it with a strong
regulatory team, including a contract research organization, to support investigational new drug submission(s)
and perform regulatory and safety monitoring. Our specific goals are (1) offer study design and regulatory
support, (2) manage, direct, monitor, and coordinate the multi-site clinical trials, and (3) develop data operation
procedures, biostatistics, and data analysis. Successful completion of the CT-DPACC project, in conjunction with
the supported PoP clinical trials network, is expected to yield clinically validated compounds for CHR."
10951129,"Young adults (age 18-35) living with psychosis (YA-P; schizophrenia spectrum disorders) have
high rates of heavy cannabis use that are associated with long-term deleterious mental health and
functional outcomes. Those early in the course of psychotic illness are especially vulnerable to the
negative impact of cannabis on future recovery. There are no effective interventions that reduce
cannabis in this group. Clinicians agree that heavy cannabis use is a significant problem for YA-P
patients and report that effective, evidence-based interventions are sorely needed.
 Families have been identified as effective and influential treatment allies for YA-P, but
often, cannabis is a highly contentious topic that can lead to interpersonal conflict. Such conflict
increases risk for psychotic relapse and is associated with non-change of substance use. The
goal of this study is to develop and pilot test an intervention for families of YA-P who use
cannabis to teach them skills to increase motivation among their YA-P to reduce their cannabis
use. Relevant skills from motivational interviewing and the community reinforcement and family
training interventions as well as psychoeducation centered on risks of cannabis to psychosis will
be core elements of the intervention. Phase 1 will focus on the development of the Cannabis
Conversation Skills for Families (CCSF) intervention material through the application of recently
collected qualitative (focus group) data. Specific adaptations will include: the development of
intervention content specific to YA-P such as education around the differential effects of THC
potency on psychosis, and the impact of cannabis misuse on psychosis intervention outcomes.
Materials will be iteratively adapted over the course of Phase 1 through pretesting the
intervention with 10 families of YA-P who frequently use cannabis. Phase 2 will include the
conduct of a randomized controlled pilot trial to assess feasibility, acceptability and preliminary
effectiveness of the CCSF with 40 relatives of YA-P who frequently use cannabis and are
engaged in coordinated specialty care. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a 6-
session group delivered CCSF or treatment as usual (TAU) intervention and will be assessed at
baseline, and 3-month follow-up.
 The specific aims are: 1) develop the CCSF for relatives of heavy cannabis using YA-P;
2) conduct a 1-arm pretest (n = 10) and counselor training trial; and 3) assess the feasibility,
acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of CCSF in a randomized pilot trial and assess target
mechanisms of expressed emotion, caregiver burden and self-efficacy."
10945302,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The proposed project will fill an important knowledge gap in the field by providing a mechanistic understanding
of how FLT3 signaling regulates neuronal function and circuit excitability in healthy and epileptic brains, and
this work will advance the field by identifying new avenues for drug intervention to rescue impaired GABAergic
inhibition that leads to brain disorders. GABAergic inhibition interacts with glutamatergic excitation to determine
the level of neural activities in the nervous system. The neuronal chloride transporter KCC2 plays a pivotal role
in regulating the polarity and efficacy of GABAergic signaling. Dysregulation of KCC2 is associated with
impaired GABAergic inhibition present in various brain disorders including epilepsy, indicating KCC2 as a
promising –yet to be explored– drug target for suppressing pathological brain hyperexcitability. Our published
work discovered that small molecule compounds inhibiting the FLT3 kinase signaling are capable of enhancing
the level of KCC2 protein expression in neurons to strengthen GABAergic inhibition. Although FLT3 has been
historically studied in the context of blood cancer, our preliminary results show for the first time that in the brain
FLT3 is specifically expressed in neurons, indicating that this kinase has functions in neurons yet to be
explored. Leveraging a newly-developed neuron-specific Flt3 conditional knockout mouse line, we
demonstrated that knocking out Flt3 gene from neurons, or treating mice with an FLT3 pathway inhibitor drug,
substantially reduces seizure susceptibility. Specifically, we propose to further investigate the functional role of
FLT3 in regulating the development of the GABAergic inhibition system in the mouse brain (Aim 1), and to
examine to what extent the FLT3 signaling cascade regulates the onset and recurrence of epileptic seizures in
mice (Aim 2). We will also elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying FLT3 signaling in the
brain (Aim 3)."
10945074,"SUMMARY – Integrins interact with their ligands to induce intracellular signals that mediate cellular activities
such as cell adhesion, spreading, and migration, which are the essential cellular activities for the function of
blood and endothelial cells. These signaling events are typically mediated by the cytoplasmic tail of integrin β
subunit, while the role of α integrin cytoplasmic tail in integrin function remains relatively underexplored. Our
research found that the fibronectin receptor integrin α5β1, via its α cytoplasmic tail, is involved in the formation of
tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), a novel type of cellular structure for cell-to-cell communication. Remarkably, our
research found that the α5β1-mediated TNT formation can be induced by the spike protein of coronavirus SARS-
CoV-2. We observed the spike-induced and α5-dependent TNT formation in model cell lines and primary human
blood and endothelial cells. Furthermore, we found that α5β1 integrin can mediate the spike-induced
proinflammatory response in human blood and endothelial cells, which may contribute to the thrombotic events
in COVID-19. TNTs are long actin-rich cell membrane protrusions that have been increasingly recognized as
functional subcellular structures for long-distance dynamic intercellular connection. Functioning as conduits
between connected cells, TNTs can transport cytoplasmic components like small molecules, proteins, vesicles,
and mitochondria intercellularly. Accumulating evidence suggests that TNTs are involved in the progress of many
pathological conditions such as cancer, inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases. Bacteria and virus
pathogens also exploit TNTs for cell-to-cell transmission. TNTs can form under cell stress conditions such as
inflammation and virus infection. However, the cellular mechanisms regulating TNT formation remain largely
unknown. This is mainly because little to nothing is known about the cell surface receptors directly responsible
for TNT biogenesis. Our discovery of α5β1 integrin as a functional signaling receptor for TNT formation provides
a powerful platform for investigating TNT biology. Mechanistically, we found that both α5β1-mediated TNT
formation and proinflammatory response require the participation of α5 cytoplasmic tail, suggesting that these
two processes are interconnected events. Moreover, our protein interaction data suggest a direct binding
between α5β1 and the spike protein, which is independent of the classical integrin recognition Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)
motif. Based on these promising data, this application aims to elucidate the cellular mechanisms governing the
non-conventional signaling function of α5β1 integrin in TNT formation and inflammation in blood and endothelial
cells. Multifaced biochemical, biophysical, structural and cell biology approaches will be used to identify
intracellular molecules and signaling pathways involved in the α5β1-mediated TNT formation (Aim 1) and
inflammation (Aim 2) and to characterize the non-RGD dependent α5β1 and ligand interaction (Aim 3). The
outcome of this study will advance both integrin and TNT biology and uncover potential therapeutic targets for
modulating TNTs and inflammation in various diseases."
10946838,"Our current clinical approach to re-irradiation is not based on data. Guidelines vary widely and are not rooted in
observed toxicities. A frequently cited reason for that is both the scarcity of existing outcome data, as well as its
heterogeneity: there are multiple radiation courses per patient with variable time between treatments. It is correct
that the lack of data is a severe problem, though one that will be solved given the steep increase in the number
of re-irradiation cases and published data. What the current lack of data obscures is a much more fundamental
problem: that even if we had enough outcome data, there is no conceptual framework or outcome model to fit
that data to. The need for such an approach to guide clinical treatment of re-irradiation is urgent. While re-
irradiation used to be rare, patient volumes are growing rapidly: studies report that already 1 in 6 patients that
come for radiotherapy have received prior radiation to the involved or a nearby site.
To overcome the challenges described above, we propose a novel approach to guide re-irradiation based on
imaging the evolution of normal tissue damage and recovery. In this space, data is more plentiful, with imaging
at defined, clinically relevant follow-up timepoints. Furthermore we can build on our success in describing and
analyzing normal tissue response to radiation.
To overcome the challenges described above, we propose a novel framework to guide re-irradiation based on
two innovative concepts: 1) Quantifying the evolution of normal tissue damage and recovery after RT. The time
factor that is so important in re-irradiation can be studied using the evolution of radiation-induced normal tissue
damage on imaging. 2) Normal tissue radiosensitivity in an individual patient is conserved between RT courses.
While this seems intuitive, it is not known if normal tissue response in patients correlates when re-irradiating
them. We have unique preliminary indicating that there is a strong relationship, and proving this hypothesis would
enable us to integrate the response to the first treatment into the planning of the second.
Based on these two concepts we formulated our two independent aims. In SA1 we will describe normal tissue
recovery based on follow-up imaging using imaging biomarkers of liver and lung injury after radiotherpay. We
hypothesize that we can parameterize the dose-dependent recovery from radiation-induced injury using a single,
patient-specific recovery parameter in normal liver (SA1a) and lung (SA1b) after radiotherapy. In SA2 we will
explore feasibility of personalization of re-RT based on the observed normal tissue response at first RT. Our
working hypothesis is that the observed radiation-induced image changes after the first RT predicts normal tissue
response at second RT, when corrected for the initially given dose distribution.
Upon completion of these aims we will possess a generalizable framework for re-irradiation that allows us to
incorporate the patient’s individual response to the first radiation treatment, and the time that has passed since,
into the planning of re-irradiation."
10947101,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Two issues related to adolescent vaccination have recently come to the forefront of public health in the United
States (US): coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination and general vaccine hesitancy (i.e., a delay or
refusal of any vaccination despite availability). These issues are especially important for adolescents in rural
areas, as these areas experience several vaccine-related disparities. A necessary starting point in this novel
line of research is to gain an in-depth understanding of these health outcomes via two types of epidemiological
data. First, we need to quantify COVID-19 vaccine coverage and the prevalence of general vaccine hesitancy
in rural areas. Second, we need to identify multi-level factors associated with each outcome in rural areas. In
producing these epidemiological data, it is critical to do so in a way that accounts for the heterogeneity of rural
areas. However, a key and recurring limitation of past vaccine-related research is that rural areas have been
aggregated into a single, homogeneous group. This approach obscures the heterogeneity of rural areas and
can actually create “hidden” disparities between different types of rural areas. Rural-Urban Continuum Codes
(RUCCs) are a measurement approach that avoids this limitation and examines rurality in a nuanced manner
by classifying each US county into one of nine categories that span the continuum of urbanicity/rurality.
Our long-term goal is to understand how rurality affects COVID-19 vaccine coverage and general vaccine
hesitancy and then apply this understanding to improve these outcomes in rural areas. The proposed study will
take the first step toward achieving this goal by generating the epidemiological data described above. We will
analyze existing data from the 2022-2023 National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen) on both COVID-19
vaccine coverage among a large national sample of adolescents (estimated n=40,650) and general vaccine
hesitancy among their parents. In doing so, we will use RUCC categories to examine rurality during analyses.
Specifically, the proposed study will determine how rurality affects COVID-19 vaccine coverage among
adolescents (Aim 1), multi-level factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine coverage (Aim 2), general vaccine
hesitancy among parents (Aim 3), and multi-level factors associated with general vaccine hesitancy among
parents (Aim 4). Each aim will address a unique research question and together will provide the most
comprehensive data to date on rurality, COVID-19 vaccine coverage, and general vaccine hesitancy. Findings
will provide highly novel data that impact future interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine coverage and
decrease general vaccine hesitancy in rural areas (e.g., results will identify priority rural areas for interventions
to target and highlight strategies that interventions can use to improve these health outcomes)."
10946201,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has emerged as a powerful new class of living medicines for
cancer therapy, especially for patients with resistant or refractory blood cancers. However, application of CAR-
T cell therapy to solid cancers has had little success, due to challenges of heterogenous antigen expression,
limited tumor infiltration and CAR-T cell dysfunction in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.
Combinatorial treatment approaches, such as integration of radiotherapy to CAR-T cells, may provide an
effective strategy to propagate antitumor immunity and overcome obstacles posed by solid tumors. In a
preliminary study using CAR-T cells co-expressing somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) for the targeted delivery
of an immunomodulatory dose of 177Lu-DOTATATE, we noted rapid tumor localization of 177Lu-DOTATATE and
subsequent regression of large established tumors. Furthermore, our preliminary data show an increase in
serum IFN-γ and perforin following treatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE, suggesting a radiation-induced effect on
T-cell immunity. Our objective in this R21 proposal is to explore the potential of target radiotherapy (TRT),
delivered systemically through SSTR2-expressing CAR-T cells and an FDA-approved theranostic
endoradiotherapy (177Lu-DOTATATE, Lutathera), to enhance CAR-T cell therapy. Our Specific Aims are to: 1)
Investigate the impact of image-guided TRT on antitumor immune responses. We hypothesize that an
optimized TRT dose can inflame tumors, rendering them more susceptible to T-cell cytotoxicity and thereby
facilitating tumor eradication. Guided by CAR-T cell imaging and dosimetry estimation, we will conduct a dose
response study to identify the optimal radiation dose for this innovative combination therapy. Additionally,
utilizing a heterogenous tumor model, we will explore the potential of immunomodulatory TRT to promote
tumor killing through TRAIL- and Fas-mediated mechanisms, partially independent of CAR-T cells. This
approach holds the promise of addressing some mechanisms of tumor resistance, such as antigen escape. 2)
Elucidate the underlying mechanism for the synergistic combination of TRT and CAR-T cell therapy.
Using the syngeneic mouse model with an intact immune system and tumor microenvironment, we aim to
validate and elucidate key phenotypic behaviors and molecular pathways driving the synergy between
immunomodulatory low-dose TRT and CAR-T cell therapy. Our experimental approach will encompass
techniques such as flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and single cell multi-omics analysis. The proposed
work offers a new strategy for combining endoradiotherapy with CAR-T cell therapy that will be applicable to
systemic disease with widespread metastases. Furthermore, it will add mechanistic insights in understanding
the immunomodulatory effects of radiation."
10977323,"The advent of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) substantially improved life
expectancy but, now, PLWHA who smoke lose more life-years due to tobacco use than they do to their HIV
infection. Unfortunately, the rate of smoking among PLWHA in the US is about 40%. The limited tobacco use
treatment research with PLWHA indicates that behavioral treatments and medications (nicotine patch and
varenicline) yield moderate effects on cessation, with quit rates that are considerably lower than they are for the
general population. Thus, there is a critical need to identify novel ways to optimize tobacco cessation treatment
for smokers with HIV. Two factors are highly predictive of cessation outcomes with pharmacotherapy, in the
general population and among PLWHA. First, a smoker's rate of nicotine metabolism, characterized by the
nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR, a marker of CYP2A6 gene variants), predicts cessation both for varenicline and
nicotine patch. Our studies with general population and HIV-infected smokers show that personalizing the choice
of medications for smokers using the NMR can increase efficacy and reduce toxicities, an approach highlighted
by the NCI (https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/budget/plan/public-health). Second, adherence to smoking
cessation medications, in the general population and among PLWHA, rarely exceeds 60% and non-adherence
lowers cessation rates 2-3 fold. We developed the Managed Problem Solving (MAPS) intervention which is
endorsed by the CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/research/interventionresearch/compendium/ma/index.html) as
an evidence-based intervention for medication adherence among PLWHA. Thus, the application's premise is
that incorporating intervention components to tailor tobacco use medications (varenicline or patch) with the NMR
and increase adherence to the medication using MAPS will optimize tobacco treatments for PLWHA. To test this
premise, we will conduct a rigorous multi-site randomized clinical trial with 488 HIV+ smokers to evaluate
NMR-tailored treatment and MAPS as optimization strategies for tobacco dependence treatment for PLWHA.
We will use a factorial design to examine: 1) The effects of the NMR-tailored and/or MAPS interventions on end-
of-treatment (EOT) and 6-month smoking cessation rates (primary aim); 2) Mediators of the NMR-tailored and
MAPS interventions (secondary aim); and 3) Moderators of the NMR-tailored and MAPS interventions
(exploratory aim). Our overall approach is consistent with the Multiphase Optimization Strategy which has gained
prominence for guiding the evaluation of interventions for enhancing tobacco use treatment effectiveness.
Addressing these aims will determine: the use of adherence and pharmacogenetic optimization of smoking
cessation treatment for PLWHA, the mechanisms that underlie the effects of these optimization strategies on
cessation outcomes, and the variation in the effects of these optimization strategies across sub-groups of
PLWHA. In the end, this trial will help understand if getting the right medication to the right person and helping
to make sure they sufficiently use that medication optimizes tobacco cessation treatment for this population."
10977416,"This proposal responds to the provocative question PQ9: What methods can be developed to effectively
study small or rare populations relevant to cancer research? We will address this question by generating
organoid models of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGL) to fill gaps in the mechanisms underlying
tumor behavior and in therapeutic opportunities. PPGLs are rare catecholamine-secreting, neural crest-derived
tumors originating from adrenal or extra adrenal paraganglia, respectively. Malignant PPGLs can only be
recognized after detection of metastases, implying a late diagnosis. Approximately 30-40% of paragangliomas,
and 10-15% of pheochromocytomas can develop metastases. In addition, PPGLs are clinically heterogeneous,
can be recurrent and invasive, even without metastasis, but predictors of clinical behavior are lacking. Treatment
options are currently limited, with modest effects on survival, and advances in this area are dampened by a
scarcity of research models. Therefore, there is a critical need for developing models to uncover biological
mechanisms that facilitate clinical outcome prediction and reveal molecular vulnerabilities which can be explored
for therapeutic purposes. Our preliminary data indicate that we can successfully generate PPGL organoids that
are amenable for drug screen. Our aims are: 1) to determine if PPGL organoids recapitulate features of the
parental tumor; 2) to leverage PPGL organoids to investigate outstanding biological questions, including the
existence of cell subtypes that may be related to tumor outcome, and 3) to utilize PPGL organoids for high-
throughput drug screening that uncover vulnerabilities for future therapeutic testing, including novel leads
suggested in our preliminary data. The proposed project will serve as a useful resource for designing future
studies to decode the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying PPGL development and clinical
heterogeneity. Results from these studies may provide the groundwork for future testing of candidate drugs that
might have immediate clinical application."
10943906,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) causes a substantial burden of hospitalizations and deaths among older
adults, comparable to that of influenza. The new and effective RSV vaccines have the potential to dramatically
reduce RSV morbidity and mortality, yet their full public health impact will not be realized if the racial and ethnic
disparities in RSV vaccine uptake mirror those observed in other respiratory virus-vaccines, from COVID-19 to
influenza. We have the opportunity to adapt community-based interventions from the COVID-19 pandemic to
proactively address disparities in RSV vaccine uptake. However, evidence-based data, conducted in
partnership with impacted communities, are essential.
This project will focus on increasing RSV vaccine uptake among Latinos, a community disproportionatly
affected by respiratory vaccines and RSV. We will leverage our well-established community-academic
partnership, Unidos en Salud, to adapt two components of our ‘Motivate, Vaccinate, Activate’ intervention—
CHW counseling and text message nudges. This multi-component intervention was originally designed to
increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake among Latinos and to activate people to recommend vaccination to people
in one’s social network. Our overall study objective is to adapt this intervention to inform effective and
customizable community-based strategies to increase RSV vaccine uptake. In addition to a rigorous
randomized trial design, we will collect detailed implementation outcomes to aide in generalizability and
adaption to other vaccines and settings. Our primary hypothesis is that language-and culturally-concordant
CHW motivation and activation counseling sessions, coupled with text message nudges, will increase RSV
vaccine confidence by adressing trust, knowledge, and access-related barriers. The proposed study has three
aims. In Aim 1 we will use the ADAPT-IT framework to adapt two intervention components: CHW counseling
and text-message nudges to increase RSV vaccine uptake among Latino older adults (>60 years) (Aim 1a)
and enable younger adults (18-50 years old) to discuss RSV vaccination with older adults in their social and
family networks (Aim 1b). Then in Aim 2 we will conduct a two-arm type-1 effectiveness implementation trial to
determine the effectiveness and implementation of a CHW counseling and text-message intervention on RSV
vaccine uptake in Latino adults >60 years. In Aim 3, using a parallel trial design and social network analytic
techniques, we will test the effectiveness of CHW counseling and text-message nudges on activating Latino
adults to discuss RSV vaccination with the older adults within their social networks.
The proposed work will provide timely, rigorous, and adaptable data to directly inform community-based
approaches to increase RSV vaccination. In addition to providing timely data to reduce RSV vaccine
disparities, these data will also advance our scientific understanding of the effectiveness of text-messages from
community-based organizations and community-based interventions aimed at activating cross-generational
social networks to boost vaccine uptake."

Tuberculosis (TB) afflicts nearly one-third of the world’s population, but progress in development of
interventions is hamstrung by the slow growth rate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent,
and the need to evaluate viability by colony forming units (cfu). We plan to overcome this roadblock through
development and validation of imaging technologies that can be broadly applied to all TB research. Our
studies have produced new imaging technologies for TB, with the most sensitive having a threshold of ~103
cfu during pulmonary infection. Imaging allows therapeutic evaluation within hours, rather than weeks, both
in vitro and in animals, but improved sensitivity would have a transformative effect on the TB field. We have
demonstrated the ability of imaging to quantify and track infection in nearly any tissue if the bacteria are at
high enough levels, but the thresholds of detection have not been low enough to ensure relevant infectious
doses can be detected in deep tissues. The proposed project would significantly increase sensitivity, offering
the unique opportunity to track infection, vaccines, therapeutics and challenge doses for Mtb in real-time at
physiologically relevant bacterial numbers. We will build upon our earlier studies by improving and validating
the ability of REF imaging to sensitively track the bacteria, evaluate efficacy of therapeutics, determine
bacterial loads in nearly any tissue and the ability to rapidly determine vaccine efficacy. Specifically, we
propose to: 1) Develop new imaging technologies for Mtb. Our working hypothesis is that optimized
imaging technologies can allow detection of single bacteria in vitro and in vivo. Our preliminary data
demonstrated that we can improve imaging sensitivity and specificity through modifications of REF and SREL
substrates and application of microendoscopy. In this aim we will examine novel substrates and modified
microendoscopy systems for improving the threshold of detection and monitoring Mtb in vitro and in vivo. 2)
Improve imaging technologies to transform Mtb pathogenesis studies. Our working hypothesis is that
the ability of imaging to track Mtb in all organs during infections will give new insight into pathogenesis. Our
preliminary data suggest imaging with new reporters (NanoLuc/NanoBRET) could allow more sensitive
localization during dissemination from the lungs. In this aim we will validate these observations by quantifying
bacteria in lungs and other organs by imaging, validate dissemination and analysis of our existing mutants.
3) Facilitate therapeutic analysis and vaccine efficacy using imaging. Our working hypothesis is that
imaging will allow us to evaluate TB therapeutics and vaccines more rapidly. Our preliminary studies suggest
that new probes, markers and microendoscopy systems can be used to follow vaccines, challenge doses and
impact of therapeutics by imaging, providing immediate feedback on efficacy of new treatments. In this aim
we will utilize reporter vaccines and Mtb strains to analyze vaccines and therapeutics in mice to more rapidly
evaluate efficacy and compare the data obtained to conventional methods."
10894777,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cell surface inhibitory receptors (IRs) PD1 and LAG3 control cellular signaling and critical cell intrinsic effector 
T cell function and differentiation. Yet, these IRs are also expressed on exhausted intratumoral T cells, limiting 
disease clearance. IRs are critical to maintain immune control, but also represent a major barrier to effective 
anti-tumor immunity. PD1 and LAG3 are synergistic in multiple diseases, including cancers, and many CD8+ and 
CD4+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) express PD1/LAG3. Indeed, we showed that tumor immunotherapy 
targeting PD1/LAG3 can induce almost complete remission of tumors in mice, and clinical evidence now supports 
the benefit of single (anti-PD1) or dual (anti-PD1/LAG3) IR blockade. This project will test the central hypothesis 
that “PD1 and LAG3 synergize to enforce tumor-induced tolerance using a combination of overlapping and 
unique cell intrinsic and extrinsic functions in CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells”. Due to potency of tolerance in the 
tumor microenvironment (TME), mouse models represent an outstanding system to study IR mechanisms to 
compare with processes in autoimmune (Project 1) and chronic viral settings (Project 3). We will pursue 3 Aims:
AIM 1: What are the relative and synergistic contributions of PD1 and LAG3 in limiting the initial CD8+ T 
cell anti-tumor effector response? We hypothesize that “PD1 and LAG3 do not initiate but temporally reenforce progression toward CD8+ T cell exhaustion by limiting population dynamics, differentiation, metabolic 
health, and polyfunctionality”. We will use a Quad AT system that co-transfers tumor-specific CD8+ T cells that 
are wild-type or lack PD1 and/or LAG3 for functional and transcriptional analysis in the same microenvironment. 
AIM 2: What are the relative and synergistic contributions of PD1 and LAG3 in limiting initial CD4+ Tconv
anti-tumor effector response? We hypothesize that “PD1/LAG3 have synergistic effects on CD4+ Tconv cells 
by differentially modulating their function and capacity for CD8+ T cell help”. We will interrogate the role of 
PD1/LAG3 on CD4+ T cells using our novel CreERT2 line to delete alleles in CD4+ Tconv but not CD8+ T cells or 
Tregs. 
AIM 3: What is the impact of PD1/LAG3 on the durability of anti-tumor T cell memory and maintenance 
of systemic immunity? We hypothesize that “PD1 and/or LAG3 limit durability of anti-tumor immunity by 
impacting Tex reinvigoration and Tconv cell memory development and maintenance, blunting their recall response 
and limiting systemic immunity”. We will ask 2 questions: (A) What is the impact of PD1/LAG3 loss on Tex and 
their reinvigoration? (B) What is the impact of PD1/LAG3 on maintenance of T cell anti-tumor memory and recall 
response? 
PPG Interactions: Project 2 will collaborate with Project 1 to compare the impact of PD1/LAG3 loss on CD4+
T cell function in autoimmune versus tumoral settings; with Project 3 to compare CD8+ T cell exhaustion induced 
by tumors or chronic viral infections; and with Core A to exchange data, Core B to obtain mice, Core C for 
transcriptional analysis and CRISPR/sgRNA sequences, and Core D for immunohistological analysis."
10894779,"SUMMARY
Despite considerable clinical impact of blocking checkpoints such as PD1 and LAG3, the mechanisms remain 
poorly understood. One remaining gap is how PD1 and LAG3 regulate formation of TEX precursors early in 
chronic infection and mature TEX subsets later. Answering this question will identify molecular mechanisms that 
link PD1 and LAG3 to preventing or reversing exhaustion and new therapeutic opportunities. We hypothesize 
that individual and combined signals from PD1 and LAG3 engage temporally distinct, therapeutically relevant 
mechanisms to regulate T cell exhaustion that will be discovered by dissecting the synergy between these 
pathways at different stages of T cell exhaustion. This project will address this hypothesis by testing:
Aim 1: How do signals from PD1 or LAG3 or both promote formation of TEX precursors? Here, we will 
reveal how PD1 and/or LAG3 are involved in initial molecular and cellular establishment of early TEX formation 
and provide opportunities for preventing development of exhaustion. We hypothesize that PD1 and/or LAG3 are 
necessary to initiate and temporally reinforce development of TEX during chronic viral infection through 
mechanisms that involve TCF1, NFAT, and/or TOX. We will use constitutive or inducible CD8 T cell-intrinsic PD1 
and/or LAG3 deficiency together with antibody (Ab) blockade and novel exhaustion tracking mice 
(i.e.Lag3CreERT2.Rosa26LSL.tdTomato or ToxCreERT2.Rosa26LSL.tdTomato) from Core B. Thus, Aim 1 will deliver detailed 
maps of how PD1 and LAG3 separately and together regulate initial formation of TEX.
Aim 2: What are the molecular and epigenetic events caused by temporally induced loss of PD1 or LAG3 
in mature TEX subsets? Despite the clinical relevance of checkpoint blockade, the underlying biology of TEX
reinvigoration remains poorly understood, particularly surrounding early molecular events associated with 
reinvigoration in vivo and its impact on different TEX subsets. We hypothesize that early molecular events 
following removal of PD1 and/or LAG3 are distinct for different TEX subsets, imparting novel functional, 
transcriptional, and/or differentiation changes that will enable us to identify new molecular targets to reverse or 
prevent exhaustion. Here, we will interrogate bulk and single-cell transcriptional as well as epigenetic changes 
in total TEX and TEX subsets over a high-resolution time-course following removal of PD1 and/or LAG3. 
Discoveries will be further dissected using in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 screening and RV approaches (Core C). These 
data will provide important insights for applying PD1 and/or LAG3 blockade in humans. 
PPG Interactions: Because the core program of exhaustion is conserved in chronic infections, tumors, and 
autoimmunity, Project 3 will connect extensively with Projects 1 and 2 for experimental models and mechanistic 
insights from autoimmunity or tumors. We will also coordinate with Core A to exchange data and interact, Core 
B to obtain mice, Core C for RV approaches and bioinformatics, and Core D for immunohistology."
10947746,"The Ras family of proteins contain four major isoforms, and altogether these proteins are constitutively activated
in a third of cancers. In the past decade, inhibitors to mutant Ras (RasG12C) have been developed, but most
patients administered RasG12C inhibitors (RasG12Ci) relapse. Interestingly, these Ras inhibitor resistant tumors
have Ras signaling reactivated and the signaling mechanisms underlying this drug resistance are unknown. To
uncover these drug resistance mechanisms, I developed Ras activity sensors and Ras activity dependent
proximity labelers, applied them to RasG12C-addicted cancer cells treated with RasG12Ci, and observed that
RasG12Ci blocked mutant Ras signaling at the plasma membrane while wildtype (WT) Ras is activated at
endomembranes to fuel oncogenic signaling and cell growth. While these results are preliminary as these studies
were done in 2D cell culture and do not delineate which particular Ras isoforms enable RasG12Ci resistance,
these exciting findings beg the question of whether cancer cells can evade other recently developed Ras
inhibitors targeting RasG12C, G12D, G12R, or G12S by also reactivating Ras signaling. Therefore, the objective
of this K99/R00 proposal is to expand the molecular toolkit for Ras and utilize these tools to profile and uncover
the molecular mechanisms driving Ras inhibitor resistance. The central hypothesis driving this work is that WT
Ras compensation for mutant Ras inhibition is a general feature cancer cells employ to evade Ras inhibitors.
Profiling the subcellular Ras activities during Ras inhibitor treatment and uncovering the molecular components
driving this reorganization of Ras signaling will allow better understanding of Ras inhibitor resistance and
illumination of new therapeutic targets. To investigate this hypothesis, the following specific aims will be
addressed: (1) Developing and applying Ras sensors in complex cancer cell models (K99); (2) De novo design
of Ras isoform selective tools (K99/R00); and (3) Profiling and dissecting the mechanisms underpinning Ras
inhibitor resistance (R00). In the proposed research, I will protein engineer current and new Ras tools (sensors,
proximity labelers, perturbators) along with microscopy and proteomic techniques to determine how Ras
inhibitors impact compartmentalized Ras signaling. The expected outcomes are (1) an expansion of tools that
can be applied to in vivo models and probe specific Ras isoforms and (2) a better understanding of how Ras
inhibitors operate and how drug resistance can occur. Of note, I believe these new Ras tools will be of great
interest to the cancer community (e.g. NCI’s Ras initiative) and can be useful for other applications beyond the
scope of this proposal such as diagnostics and therapeutics. Towards completion of the proposed work, I will be
trained in protein design methods and complex cancer models and guided by an advisory committee composed
of experts in cancer, Ras signaling, and cell culture. The long-term goal of this project is to develop an
independent research program that bridges protein design with cancer cell biology to understand how oncogenic
signaling pathways rewire themselves during oncogenesis and drug resistance."
10948788,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Granuloma formation is a feature of tuberculosis (TB), a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)
infection. Alveolar macrophages (alvMF) are central to this process as the first cells infected by Mtb and likely
as drivers of early granuloma development. The initial events when alvMFs encounter Mtb and the cell-cell
interactions occurring in mature granulomas are extensively investigated but less is known about what happens
between the initial infection event and later stages of disease. These early events have implications for the
trajectory of TB and some individuals restrict Mtb at this stage and never develop disease despite multiple
exposures whereas other individuals cannot restrict Mtb replication and progress to granuloma formation. Our
lack of knowledge of the molecular and cellular circuits underlying early granuloma formation and what
differentiates outcomes at this stage is a fundamental gap that limits the development of therapeutic interventions
for TB. This gap is especially acute for people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which
significantly increases risks of poor outcomes from TB, and addressing it will have significant public health value.
Critical unanswered questions in the acute response to Mtb infection include (1) how do interactions between
immune cells immediately after alvMF infection contribute to granuloma formation, (2) which components of
these interactions can be perturbed to bias disease dynamics to improve control over Mtb replication, and (3)
what interactions are altered by HIV infection that increase susceptibility to active TB? We discovered that
infected MF secrete interferons (IFNs), cytokines, and chemokines within minutes to hours after infection that
drive the inflammatory responses that support granuloma formation. Moreover, we have shown that type I IFN
expression and neutrophil recruitment support Mtb replication and we are investigating how these responses
contribute to infection outcomes. Recently, we showed that type I IFN drives release of neutrophil extracellular
traps that promote Mtb replication instead of restricting it and are associated with the development of necrotic
granulomas. Based on these data, we hypothesize that early interactions between macrophages and neutrophils
are regulated by a self-propagating cycle of type I IFN and damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP)
signaling that culminates in granuloma formation. Moreover, our work showing that I IFN-conditioned immune
cells are less able to control Mtb infection leads us to hypothesize that HIV-induced type I IFN signaling amplifies
this type I IFN–DAMP circuit and promotes an environment that supports Mtb replication, tissue damage, and
TB susceptibility. We predict that breaking the type I IFN–DAMP cycle therapeutically will push early responses
toward protective functions. To test our hypothesis, we propose to 1) Define type 1 IFN and DAMP signaling
effects in innate immune cells following initial Mtb infection, 2) Dissect the molecular basis of the type I IFN-
DAMP circuit to identify vulnerabilities where therapeutic interventions can promote control of Mtb, and 3)
Determine how HIV affects the type 1 IFN-DAMP circuit propagated by Mtb infection."

The impaired ability to suppress an inappropriate but pre-potent response (response inhibition; RI)
characterizes several debilitating clinical problems, including obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
(OCRD) such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, trichotillomania, and skin picking disorder. There is a critical
need to develop an effective and durable treatment for OCRDs with demonstrable evidence for impacting
impaired RI, a transdiagnostic intervention target specified in the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) Cognitive
Control systems. The objective of our R61/R33 application is to 1) examine the impact of a novel computerized
intervention, response inhibition training (RIT), on neural indices of RI, and 2) examine the mechanistic link
between engagement of the neural RI targets and change in symptoms in a randomized clinical trial for
individuals with OCD, trichotillomania, and/or skin picking disorders. The R61 phase aims to examine whether
RIT can attain the predetermined criterion-level change in neural RI indices (i.e., activation in right inferior
frontal cortex; rIFC) (Aim1). Adults with OCRD (N=48) will be randomized to RIT or placebo training (PLT), with
neural indices of RI assessed at pre- and post-intervention. If the rIFC is successfully engaged as a valid target,
the RIT should show a greater level of rIFC activation during a RI task at both between-groups and within-
group levels. The R61 “go/no-go” decision will be made by two effect size-based criteria: 1) η2=.06 or greater in
a between-groups comparison; and 2) d=.5 or greater in a within-group pre-post RIT comparison. The R33
phase aims to determine the effectiveness of RIT in improving OCRD symptoms (Aim2a), and to examine
whether the reduction in OCRD symptoms is mediated by changes in neural RI indices (Aim2b). To this end,
Adults with OCRD (N=70) will be randomized to RIT or PLT, with pre-to-post neural measures of RI and pre-to-
follow-up measures of OCRD symptoms. In both phases the RIT dosage (number of sessions) will be
individually quantified and adjusted based on the ongoing monitoring of the behavioral RI process. Resulting
data are expected to guide the development of RIT as a personally-optimizable intervention with a
demonstrated neurobehavioral mechanism of action for treating OCRD. This contribution is significant as it can
result in a transdiagnostically-applicable intervention capable of therapeutically modifying RI deficits. Our
approach is innovative because it proposes a fundamentally different therapeutic approach to OCRD using a
computerized, engaging (gamified), accessible, and cost-efficient intervention that can be easily implemented
and disseminated. Further, in our personalized-medicine approach, we will examine the feasibility of an
individually-optimizable intervention with a precise dose-control capability by monitoring the status of
behavioral RI target. These innovative features highlight the substantial public health impact afforded by our
effort to translate the accumulated neurobehavioral literature for RI processes to a widely applicable
intervention for RI-implicated problems."

Childhood exposure to violence (CEV) is a significant and preventable public health problem in the United States.
Children of all ages are at risk for CEV, but children ages five and under are particularly vulnerable. The traumatic
stress caused by early CEV has a significant, deleterious effect on developmental outcomes. Young children
consistently interact with the healthcare system for well-child visits, and this system can play a critical role in
identifying and responding to CEV. Yet, research to date indicates that clinicians in pediatric healthcare settings
do not consistently assess for CEV, particularly recent or current CEV. The Joint Commission’s 2023 mandate
to assess social risks (e.g., CEV) across healthcare settings provides a unique opportunity to routinely assess
CEV. The objectives of the proposed research in this Pathway to Independence Award are to examine the
implementation of CEV assessment in pediatric primary care settings, assess patterns of early CEV assessment
across one health system, and investigate whether these assessments are associated with healthcare and health
outcomes. The specific aims are to: (1) identify existing practices for CEV assessment and follow-up in pediatric
primary care settings; (2) delineate facilitators and barriers to CEV assessment and follow-up; (3) characterize
patterns of early CEV assessment patterns by patient, clinician, and site; and (4) elucidate how early CEV
assessment is associated with healthcare referral, healthcare receipt, and child health outcomes. This study
directly attends to the Joint Commission mandate, and findings will inform related measurement development
and implementation efforts. To acquire the necessary skills to accomplish this project, I will receive training in
four critical areas: (1) psychometrics; (2) implementation science; (3) social determinants of health research
methodology; and (4) big data analysis techniques. I will also engage in professional development, extend my
professional networks, and further develop my grant writing and oral presentation skills. I have assembled an
interdisciplinary mentorship team with expertise in pediatrics, violence prevention, implementation science,
social determinants of health research, and psychometrics to ensure completion of the proposed research and
training plan. This Pathway to Independence Award will enable me to develop into an interdisciplinary,
independent investigator who examines strategies to prevent CEV and reduce its negative consequences across
the life course."
10948484,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Neurodegenerative diseases are devastating, fatal diseases that affect millions of people worldwide and
have no definitive treatment. A well-known neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's Disease (AD), is the third
most common leading cause of death, with the AD Association in 2022 reporting more than 6 million people
affected in US. Although there are no clear underlying mechanisms of pathogenesis, accumulation of toxic
protein species, such as tau protein in AD, drives a large and diverse group of neurodegenerative diseases, both
genetic and sporadic. Modulating levels of disease-driving proteins has improved disease phenotypes,
highlighting a promising strategy for therapeutic development. Large-scale cell-based genetic perturbation
screens are canonical and critical tools used to find essential protein regulators that control levels of disease-
driving proteins. However, since these 2D models consist of actively dividing cells with vastly different properties
that lack physiological authenticity compared to in vivo cells, important brain-specific regulators are not present
and thus not detected and false positives are more likely to be detected. This results in an inefficient process
requiring multiple rounds of labor-intensive in vitro assays followed by validation using in vivo models before
animal studies can be performed that will hopefully lead to valid therapeutic targets.
 The goal of this proposal is to bypass cell-based screens by developing a feasible and high-
throughput genome-wide in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 screening method (Aim 1). Furthermore, to enhance
translation and as a means of validation, this method will be used to find regulators of tau protein levels
in the mouse brain (Aim 2). Aim 1 will set the parameters for in vivo screening using intracerebroventricular
(ICV) injection of the adeno-associated virus (AAV) harboring gRNA/Cas9 into neonatal mice to broadly perturb
target genes in the brain. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis will then be utilized to track protein
levels in each dissociated single cell in a high throughput manner. Aim 2 will expand the in vivo screening method
into a tauopathy mouse model, which recapitulates AD-related phenotypes and involves the pathogenic
accumulation of tau protein in two brain regions (cerebral cortex and striatum) vulnerable to neurodegeneration.
The impact of this proposal is manifold: providing a powerful tool to bypass labor-intensive in vitro processes for
the identification of new therapeutic targets for numerous neurodegenerative diseases; providing comprehensive
insight into the regulation of tau and reveal candidate therapeutic targets for tauopathies; enhancing our
understanding of how disease-causing proteins are differently regulated depending on the brain region, in normal
physiological conditions versus disease condition, which will provide insight into regional vulnerability/resilience
to neurodegeneration. Taken together, completion of this endeavor will provide a novel and powerful tool
to understand the regulation of disease-driving proteins and will help us discover promising therapeutic
targets that are validated in the brain, making the strategy applicable to many neurological diseases."
10947679,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT.
A lack of outcome-focused quality measures is holding back mental health (MH) progress. This gap means that
regulatory bodies and third-party payers do not have a “common denominator” that they can use to compare
the impact of MH symptoms and treatment options across all MH and physical health (PH) conditions. For
example, we cannot effectively compare the overall impact of treatment for depression to treatment for other
MH conditions such as schizophrenia, or to PH conditions such as diabetes. Quality measurement also
underpins cost-effectiveness research, and as a result we cannot accurately allocate resources needed for a
nationwide MH strategy. Furthermore, clinicians and researchers cannot recommend treatments based on
overall impact, but rather they are restricted to narrowly focused symptom and outcome measurements.
Without addressing problems in outcome-focused quality measures, patients will continue to face a disjointed
MH care system where sufficient resources are not apportioned to their needs, their clinicians cannot select
treatments in a way that will maximize their overall functioning, and research to improve their care cannot
consistently demonstrate comparative effectiveness.
Quality of life (QOL) measures provide a promising approach to serve as a common denominator for outcome-
focused quality measurement across conditions. However, current nomothetic approaches are not specific to
MH symptoms, which creates measurement insensitivity and substantially reduces measurement accuracy.
There are also many idiographic QOL measures that are tailored to specific disorders, but they are not directly
comparable across MH or PH conditions. New QOL measurement approaches are needed that are both
nomothetically comparable across disease conditions and ideographically tailored to MH phenomenology.
New developments in unsupervised machine learning (ML) are well suited to address these limitations in QOL
measurement. Specifically, we will use recent advances in mixture modeling to create a new personalized QOL
measurement approach that simultaneously produces both nomothetic and idiographic results. The proposed
project is significant and impactful because it eliminates a critical bottleneck to efforts by policy makers,
researchers, and clinicians. Results from this work will allow all of these stakeholders to better discern
differential impact among MH conditions and interventions. As a result, they will be able to better serve patients
who experience MH difficulties. This project is also scientifically and methodologically innovative. It creatively
uses new developments in unsupervised ML to implement a new measurement process while minimizing
disruption to current practices. Overall, the proposed project will provide a new standard for outcome-focused
measurement of MH care."

Alzheimer’s disease is a national public health issue. Black American and Hispanic older adults are
significantly more likely to have Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) compared with older
Whites in the United States. Diversification of ADRD researchers can lead to an increase in the participation of
racially and ethnically diverse populations in critical aging and ADRD research and improve the efficacy of
programs and services. I am committed to developing and implementing training programs that focus
specifically on increasing underrepresented and minority (URM) participation in ADRD research. I have had a
fruitful research career that has focused on mentoring faculty members and students in community
engagement methods, health communication principles, and dissemination and implementation science - each
independently – as related to ADRD and other chronic diseases. With this siloed approach, junior scholars are
at a disadvantage and may have limited skills and training in applying these strategies together for truly
impactful public health outcomes. The proposed program will integrate these fields into a comprehensive,
equity-driven training program to effectively address how social determinants of health (SDoH) influence ADRD
disparities and outcomes among URM communities. With this K07 award, I will develop and formalize such a
program to provide in-depth training and mentorship to 12 junior scholars (and engage several additional
researchers in seminars and workshops) with a team of interdisciplinary program faculty and visiting scientists
to advance research on SDoH that influence ADRD-related health disparities. Specific aims are to: (1)
Establish and implement an equity-driven research training program to build capacity and expertise in the
integration of community engagement, health communication, and implementation science research that will
advance the science on ADRD disparities and outcomes; (2) Provide mentoring and a mentor network for URM
junior faculty members in applying innovative community engagement, health communication, and
dissemination and implementation frameworks to advance the science of SDoH and ADRD disparities; and (3)
Conduct a comprehensive evaluation of all K07 activities with the goal of institutionalizing this initiative. This
award will provide an opportunity to meaningfully integrate relevant disciplines into a holistic, equity-driven, and
interdisciplinary training for advancing the science of ADRD."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading global cause of death, claiming approximately 17.9 million lives
annually. Women face a significantly higher risk of heart failure or mortality following a heart attack than men,
yet the molecular mechanisms behind this disparity remain poorly explored. This research aims to determine
the role of thyroid hormones (TH), an underexplored sexually dimorphic risk factor for female heart failure
development, with a primary focus on its tissue-level regulation. TH significantly influences the cardiovascular
system, and the higher prevalence of thyroid disease in women highlights its potential impact on female heart
health. Specifically, the study will concentrate on type 3 deiodinase (DIO3), which regulates TH levels within
tissues. Recent findings from my lab show a sexual dimorphism in Dio3 expression in the heart. We have also
demonstrated that female mice with Dio3 deficiency exhibited compromised cardiac function, including a
reduced ejection fraction, altered mitochondrial substrate utilization, and impaired recovery from myocardial
infarction. These results underscore the protective role of Dio3 in the female heart and the importance of Dio3-
dependent tissue-level TH regulation. This proposal aims to determine the role of Dio3 in cardiovascular health
outcomes in females. The overarching hypothesis is that cardiac Dio3 expression is regulated in a sex-specific
manner, playing a pivotal role in driving sex-specific outcomes in cardiovascular health. In Aim 1, we will
investigate whether Dio3 expression post-MI differs between sexes, potentially contributing to higher heart
failure susceptibility in females. In Aim 2, we will determine the interplay between estrogen and Dio3 in
influencing cardiovascular function in female mice. This aim hypothesizes that low estrogen levels reduce Dio3
activity in female mouse hearts, impairing myocardial function. The study also investigates Dio3's role in
mediating estrogen's cardioprotective effects on cardiovascular function. Together, these aims will address
crucial knowledge gaps regarding thyroid dysfunction and the sexually dimorphic onset of heart failure, aligning
with priorities identified by the NHLBI Working Group. Beyond enhancing our understanding of sex-specific
factors in cardiovascular health, this work will provide vital scientific and technical training to support Dr.
Teixeira's independent program. Ultimately, it will improve women's cardiovascular health, reduce disparities,
and advance cardiovascular science."

our HIV/AIDS community; undertake new initiatives that build on and enhance the Core’s track record of 
success; partner with other CFAR Cores, CFARs, and institutional programs to implement funding services and 
mentoring supports; support CFAR Scientific Working Groups and Research Interest Groups through training 
and mentoring opportunities; conduct strategic planning, dissemination, outreach and evaluation to assure 
effectiveness the Core’s functioning; and conduct the Core’s work in alignment with CFAR standardized policies 
and procedures. To achieve these aims the Dev Core provides a range of services, foremost of which is funding 
supports in the form of competitive mentored Pilot Awards (12 months, up to $40,000) aligned with NIH HIV 
research priorities targeted to ESIs and senior investigators new to HIV. This includes researchers affiliated with 
the CFAR institutions (UNC-CH, FHI 360, RTI), North Carolina Historically Black Colleges and Universities (NC 
HBCU), and international investigators with a strong connection to the CFAR. The Core also provides
microgrants (up to $5000) to support ESI achievement of research outcomes such as data analysis to strengthen 
NIH funding applications or research dissemination; Pilot Award supplements ($10,000) for research aligned 
with SWG priorities; and funding for a Summer HBCU & URM Fellowship to provide protected research time for 
HBCU ESI faculty. The Core ensures that all Pilot Awards and CFAR Administrative Supplements have 
appropriate regulatory and NIH approvals and monitors progress toward publication and funding outcomes for 
the same. ESI mentoring and training supports are provided through one-on-one interactions as well as peerbased mechanisms including a Developmental Cohort open to all ESI with a UNC CFAR affiliation, and an 
HBCU Cohort to address context-specific needs. The Dev Core provides structured resources such as 
orientation meetings and resource data bases for mentors, Awardees, and Cohort members and partners with 
other CFAR Cores to support the Pilot Award program through mentoring, proposal reviews, and access to 
reduced fee or free Core services. The Core further leverages other developmental programs such as the UNC 
CTSA and inter-CFAR resources such as the UCSF mentoring-the-mentors program to efficiently achieve Dev 
Core goals. The Core effectively uses a broad range of tools for communicating with and serving the Dev Core’s 
geographically dispersed user base, including on-line meetings, webinars, on-site meetings, and the CFAR’s 
online resources and listserv. The work of the Core will be guided by consultation with the Administrative Core, 
other CFAR Core Directors, surveys of the CFAR membership, an Internal Advisory Board, and an External 
Advisory Board."
10854919,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT – INTERNATIONAL CORE (CORE I)
The UNC CFAR International Core facilitates translational, clinical, epidemiological, behavioral, and health 
services research between our North Carolina-based members and international investigators at the center of 
the epidemic. We connect UNC, FHI360, and RTI scientists to critical research populations overseas and 
connect in-country scientists to collaborations and training opportunities in North Carolina. The Core provides 
critical administrative and logistical support services to CFAR members working internationally, with particular 
attention to early stage investigators and faculty who are newly expanding their work into a global setting. Among 
the most important of the services provided by Core I is the management of international IRB relationships, which 
is centralized through a dedicated international regulatory affairs unit. This critical unit manages all aspects of 
research ethics and regulatory submissions for all international HIV research activities at UNC. 
The International core also serves as a coordinating body for international HIV-related research training activities. 
Our CFAR has a total of 10 active NIH training grants with major HIV/AIDS components. In the coming funding 
cycle, we will redouble our efforts to enhance the collective impact of these programs through regular convening 
of their leadership, sharing key resources, and coordinating trainee placement. Toward this end, we are 
proposing a new Co-Director for Training who will be primarily responsible for connecting trainees to appropriate 
CFAR mentorship and assisting them in developing new research proposals to our developmental Core and to 
the NIH. 
Other key functions of our core include ensuring that our CFAR’s international HIV/AIDS research is in line with 
local priorities. This will be done through establishing a new internal advisory board comprising membership from 
each of the 5 “focus countries” in which we work. The Core I leadership will also ensure engagement of local 
investigators in all aspects of our work, support dissemination of key findings to investigators and thought leaders 
at our international sites, and facilitate south-to-south exchange of research capacity. Since laboratory capacity 
is so important to research in international settings, our core has created a laboratory support unit based at our 
flagship lab site in Malawi. Key personnel from this laboratory are available to assist other HIV research sites in 
the deployment of new assays, development and monitoring of quality assurance procedures, preparation for 
monitoring visits, and troubleshooting of lab operational problems. 
Finally, Core I will continue to promote external collaboration through active participation in ongoing intra-CFAR 
activities and through linking our membership with other NIH-sponsored networks, such as ACTG, MTN, 
IMPAACT, HPTN, and HVTN."
10949852,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the most common pregnancy complication. The offspring of individuals
with GDM are at significantly higher risk of childhood obesity, a growing epidemic that disproportionately
affects Hispanic and Black children. Because childhood obesity is challenging to reverse, there is an urgent
need to target upstream in utero and early life risk factors to mitigate the obesity epidemic. No studies to date
have examined whether achieving glycemic control during pregnancy can revert the higher risk of childhood
obesity associated with GDM; nor have any studies examined how the prenatal neighborhood environment may
be associated with pregnancy glycemia levels or childhood obesity risk in the offspring. The proposed research
seeks to address these knowledge gaps by elucidating the neighborhood- and individual-level factors
associated with pregnancy glycemia levels and childhood obesity risk in the offspring. In the K99 phase, I will
pursue didactic training complemented by mentorship from renowned experts in the field with a strong record
of mentorship and collaboration. In Aim 1, I will apply training in GDM pathophysiology and management,
neighborhood environment, and health disparities to examine joint associations of prenatal neighborhood built
environment (food environment and walkability) and individual-level behavioral (diet and physical activity) and
biological (insulin resistance) factors with pregnancy glycemia levels (no GDM and GDM with optimal or
suboptimal glycemic control). In Aim 2, I will apply training in childhood body composition to examine
associations of the pregnancy glycemia levels with childhood obesity risk and body composition. I will conduct
these aims using the Pregnancy Environment and Lifestyle Study (PETALS), a multi-racial/ethnic cohort of
3,346 pregnant individuals and their children followed up in the NIH Environmental Influences on Child Health
Outcomes (ECHO) program. In Aim 3 (R00 phase), I will harness longitudinal analysis skills to examine
associations of a more elaborate list of neighborhood-level factors (prenatal neighborhood food environment,
walkability, deprivation, racial residential segregation, and ethnic enclaves) with childhood growth patterns and
obesity risk, potential mediation by nuanced pregnancy glycemia levels (via glycemic control trajectories from
GDM diagnosis to delivery), and effect modification by race/ethnicity and childhood opportunity index. I will
conduct this analysis in the Blood Pressure in Pregnancy, Obesity, Diabetes and Perinatal Outcomes (BIPOD)
study, a population-based, socio-demographically diverse cohort of ~0.4 million pregnant individuals and their
offspring followed for up to 12 years. The proposed training and research will serve as the springboard for
developing competitive R01 applications and launching my career as an independent investigator focused on
the role of multilevel (neighborhood and individual) determinants of cardiometabolic health across the life
course to inform clinical practice and public health policies and interventions, with an ultimate goal to improve
health outcomes and reduce health disparities among pregnant individuals and their offspring."
10950255,"ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma is a uniformly lethal brain tumor despite aggressive and toxic standard of care treatments including
surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. One of the main barriers to understanding glioblastoma tumor biology and
developing more effective therapies is the dependence on invasive surgical procedures for diagnosis. The need
to obtain tumor tissue for initial diagnosis in patients with glioblastoma is limited by 1) intratumoral heterogeneity
(genomic and epigenomic), 2) temporal heterogeneity, 3) sampling error, and 4) surgical eligibility. Additionally,
surveillance of glioblastoma remains a diagnostic challenge since recurrent disease is often indistinguishable
from treatment-induced inflammation, termed pseudoprogression, on conventional imaging, which contributes to
diagnostic ambiguity and treatment delays. The identification of a non-invasive, prognostic biomarker for
longitudinal molecular profiling of glioblastoma could overcome these challenges, improving risk stratification,
clinical trial design, surveillance, and standard of care. Our prior work revealed that changes in peripheral
immune cell populations from whole-blood samples of patients with primary and recurrent glioblastoma correlate
with treatment response and overall survival, thus supporting the concept of a local and systemic tumor
microenvironment. In non-CNS tumors, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has received considerable attention to
assess tumor burden, predict treatment response, and select therapies. However, classical ctDNA approaches
using somatic mutation analysis are limited in glioblastoma due to the lack of recurrent somatic mutations,
significant intertumoral heterogeneity, and low detectability of somatic mutations in blood. We hypothesize that
methylation profiling of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) can overcome these limitations, as epigenetic modifications are
detectable in cfDNA, correspond to the cell of origin and cell state, are stable and detectable with a low input of
genomic DNA (<250 ng), and offer a greater breadth of information about the state of the cell of origin and
differential responses of clonal lineages to treatment. To our knowledge, cfDNA methylation has not been
evaluated in a prospective clinical trial as a biomarker for brain tumor biology or correlated with clinical outcomes.
To test this hypothesis, we will employ prospective blood sample from patients with glioblastoma enrolled in the
completed randomized Phase II VERTU trial (NCT02152982) to determine whether cfDNA methylation patterns
cluster with specific tumor tissue DNA methylation patterns (Aim 1). We will then characterize the impact of
changes in cfDNA methylation patterns on clinical outcomes, including survival (Aim 2). Finally, we will evaluate
whether the activation state of circulating immune cell populations, inferred from cfDNA methylation patterns,
can be used to non-invasively distinguish pseudoprogression from recurrent disease (Aim 3). These translational
aims have the potential to guide the development of non-invasive diagnostic and surveillance platforms for
patients with glioblastoma, which could impact treatment selection and clinical trial design."
10951201,"Project Summary/Abstract
Food and nutrition insecurity are clinically relevant, actionable social drivers of health (SDOH) disparities in
pediatric populations experiencing serious illnesses, for example, cancer. One approach being studied to
address outcome disparities driven by food-related SDOH in the pediatric cancer context is to provide gift
cards for an online grocery delivery platform. Prior research on compensatory cost coping with illness-related
financial burden suggests that parents may stretch these food dollars by purchasing lower priced food with
poor nutritional value. We also know that parents and siblings may cope with illness-related financial burden by
going without food and other basics to conserve household assets to meet the needs of the child who is ill,
which heightens parent and siblings’ risk for health disparities. To address health disparities in food insecure
households coping with serious pediatric illness, we need holistic models of care that integrate food and
nutrition with state of the science clinical care. Medically tailored meals (MTM; home-delivered meals tailored
to medical needs of individuals with SDOH + barriers to preparing healthy food) that consider nutrition, illness-
related alterations in taste, and parental time demands offer a Food is Medicine approach to addressing food
insecurity-related outcome disparities in pediatric serious illness populations. In studies of adults with health
conditions, MTM interventions were associated with better health outcomes and less health care spending. We
extend the MTM concept to pediatric populations in which inequities in SDOH can affect serious illness
outcomes, using pediatric cancer as proof of concept (POC). Our purpose is to determine feasibility of our
methods and MTM intervention for a future efficacy trial to improve food and nutrition security for households of
children at risk for poorer cancer outcomes due to inequities in food-related SDOH. We will accomplish our
aims by collaborating with a small business that makes tasty, healthy frozen meals with start-up funding from
National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities. Our primary research question: is an intervention
that provides healthy, frozen meals tailored to tastes of children undergoing chemotherapy feasible and
acceptable to the children and their primary parental caregiver? During year 1, we will conduct taste tastings
with children treated with chemotherapy to inform adaptation of meal flavorings to treatment-related taste
alterations (Aim 1). In year 2, we will collect quantitative and qualitative data at multiple time points from
children undergoing chemotherapy and their parents to inform rapid, data-driven refinements in our methods
and intervention. Our results will inform the potential and protocol for a future full-scale trial and cost
effectiveness studies that inform policies extending healthcare financing models to include MTM in pediatric
outpatient settings where children with serious illness receive care. The project aligns well with the socio-
ecological perspective of National Institutes of Nursing Research’s 2022 strategic plan, and its health equity,
SDOH and models of care research lenses."
10954316,"Intervertebral disc degeneration is strongly implicated as a cause of low back pain. Over a 10 year
period, more than 130,000 active service members received diagnoses of disc degeneration, with annual
incidence rates more than doubling during this time. Current treatment approaches are mostly conservative,
and in severe cases, patients may undergo surgical procedures such as spinal fusion, which do not maintain or
restore native tissue structure or mechanical function. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are attractive options
for cell-based therapies due to their potential for autologous harvest, expansion, and re-implantation making
them highly translational. A key challenge to successful application of MSCs for disc regeneration is the unique
biochemical and physical microenvironment cells are exposed to upon implantation. To overcome this
challenge, one strategy is preconditioning of MSCs by exposure to hypoxia, soft physical substrates and
developmentally-relevant stimuli during monolayer expansion in order to enhance their in vivo performance in
applications for disc regeneration. It has also been shown that MSCs isolated from bone marrow are highly
heterogeneous, both within and between donors, exhibiting distinct phenotypic characteristics, including
sensitivity to microenvironmental stress in culture. Aim 1 will therefore establish the in vitro preconditioning and
donor characteristics that maximize the survival and extracellular matrix production of MSCs in the oxygen and
nutrient-poor disc microenvironment. Preclinical demonstration of the long term efficacy of disc therapies with
respective to structural and functional regeneration, and alleviation of symptoms, using rigorously validated,
clinically-relevant outcome measures is critical to their successful future clinical translation. Our team recently
established a preclinical goat model of disc degeneration that recapitulates key characteristics of human disc
degeneration. Therefore, in Aim 2 we will establish the long term efficacy of a combined hydrogel and
optimized stem cell therapy to potentiate structural and functional disc regeneration, and alleviate symptoms, in
an established preclinical goat model of disc degeneration. To maximize the clinical impact of our findings we
will further refine our goat model to include progressive and clinically relevant functional, imaging, and
molecular biomarkers of pain and disability. Finally, in Aim 3 we will take an additional important step towards
clinical application of this therapy by establishing that adult human MSCs respond to preconditioning, and
undertake transcriptome-wide screening studies to identify unique molecular signatures that predispose MSCs
from certain human donors to enhanced performance and response to preconditioning."
10954365,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
This project endeavors to build a nanosensor array platform technology to detect whole disease fingerprints from
patient biofluids to facilitate diagnosis and biomarker discovery efforts in pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer
is currently the fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the US. The ability to diagnose pancreatic
cancer at early stages would allow many patients to be actively treated, thereby greatly improving their outcomes.
Serum biomarker measurements have been widely used as diagnostic/prognostic indicators, but many markers
are not sufficient for specific assessments of disease states. Major factors limiting precise diagnosis us-
ing these biomarkers include their low sensitivity at high specificity for diseases and the overall dearth of estab-
lished molecular markers. Therefore, innovative approaches to improve disease-state specificity/sensitivity and
biomarker discovery efforts are needed to achieve accurate identification of many conditions. I believe that the
differentiation of disease from normal biofluids may be achieved by the detection of a “disease fingerprint” by
collecting large data sets of molecular binding interactions to a diverse set of moderately selective sensors.
I will build a sensor array comprising organic color centers (covalently-modified carbon nanotubes) stabilized
with DNA to transduce subtle differences in physicochemical properties of molecules in biofluids. With sufficient
diversity, the sensors can differentiate biofluids by disease status with the aid of machine learning pro-
cesses. This platform will also be used to facilitate biomarker discovery efforts. In preliminary data, I discovered
that the responses collected from hundreds of patient samples and interpreted by machine learning algorithms
can beat established serum biomarker measurements. I plan to leverage this technology to develop a robust
diagnostic sensor platform to acquire disease fingerprints of pancreatic cancer in patients biofluids to significantly
increase sensitivity and specificity over single biomarkers and to accelerate biomarker discovery processes. I
propose to investigate: 1) the potential of this technology for the early detection of pancreatic cancer, 2) the
molecular mechanism of the response, and 3) the potential for this platform to enable the discovery of new
biomarkers. In the 2-year mentored (K99) period of the award, I aim to develop a machine perception nanosen-
sor technology with the focusing problem of pancreatic cancer detection and establish the selection rules in the
sensor array construction and the workflow of machine learning-based model development. For the 3-year in-
dependence (R00) period, I aim to systematically investigate how to render the machine learning models trans-
parent to understand the mechanism of high prediction accuracy and discover effective biomarker combinations
for clinical validation studies. Successful completion of the proposed work will result in a validated platform to
enable concomitant identification of early disease states and acceleration of protein biomarker discovery pro-
cesses in pancreatic cancer."

Worry and distress in cancer survivors are common, do not correlate with disease severity, and are heightened
in young adults who are going through multiple life transitions related to school, work, relationships, and family.
Moreover, prior studies found that cancer-related worry and distress can plague young adults many years after
initial diagnosis and treatment, sometimes persisting for over 20 years. Thyroid cancer, melanoma, and testicular
cancer represent the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th most common cancer types diagnosed in young adults, respectively. In
addition to being common cancers in young adults, these three cancers share many other similarities, including
accompanying unmet psychosocial needs. Key to managing worry and distress is ensuring individuals have
knowledge about and confidence in their ability to engage in self-management of cancer-specific worry. The
widespread use of mobile devices across diverse groups in the United States, as well as the promise of mobile
health technology for reducing cancer disparities, supports the use of the mobile optimized Personalized Cancer
Support for Young Adults (PerCS-YA) tool to reduce worry and distress while ensuring broad access by young
adults from diverse socioeconomic and geographic backgrounds. Guided by the ORBIT model for the
development of behavioral trials, we will conduct stakeholder-engaged refinement of the proposed intervention
followed by a phase II efficacy trial utilizing a population-based recruitment source (Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results (SEER) – Georgia) as well as an online cancer support community recruitment source.
Optimization will be followed by a process evaluation, in preparation for the future large randomized controlled
trial (RCT). By tailoring to the young adult cancer population, incorporating mobile technology (i.e., PerCS-YA
will be usable across mobile platforms such as iPhone and Android), and offering ongoing interactive support,
there is potential to mitigate young adult cancer survivors’ worry and distress. Ultimately, this proposed targeted
intervention will reduce the burden of cancer for young adult survivors."

Leukocyte migration out of the vasculature into peripheral tissue is crucial for their role in fighting pathogens,
promoting tissue repair, and attacking solid tumors. This process is a key control point in the inflammatory
response and relies heavily on signaling events downstream of leukocyte integrins and their endothelial
ligands. Manipulating integrin signaling could serve as untapped avenue to control immune cell functions in
inflammatory diseases and cancer, but hindering efforts on this front is a lack of mechanistic understanding of
integrin signaling events. Importantly, integrins are known to be central players in mechanotransduction
(converting mechanical information into a biochemical response), yet very little is known about how immune
cells use integrins to sense and respond to the mechanical cues on the molecular level. This is surprising,
since there is strong evidence that inflammation causes endothelial cells to change their mechanical
properties, driving immune cell infiltration. Our preliminary data show that, indeed, T cells can respond to the
mechanical properties of their substrate through the integrin LFA-1, kicking off cytoskeletal changes that drive
T cell migration. Importantly, we found a signaling scaffold, named CasL, that is mechanically activated and
required for T cell migration downstream of LFA-1. Surprisingly, T cells lacking CasL fail to form an actin-rich
leading edge, but instead display numerous membrane blebs, suggesting CasL may control cytoskeletal
responses and/or cortical integrity. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that CasL is a crucial
mechanosensitive signaling hub governing cytoskeletal responses during T cell migration. Specifically,
we hypothesize CasL controls cytoskeletal organization by regulating the activity of one or more of the Rho
family GTPases, thus coordinating proper cytoskeletal responses and optimum motility. In Aim 1, we will take
a systematic approach to determine how CasL regulates cytoskeletal dynamics and cortex-membrane integrity,
focusing on the Rho GTPases and their downstream effector proteins, and then test the hypothesis that CasL
function is crucial to maintain normal cortex-membrane stiffness. In Aim 2, we will leverage our ability to
introduce mutants into primary T cells lacking CasL to undertake a structure/function analysis of CasL in T cell
migration. We will define how CasL phosphorylation, as well as how each individual domain, contributes to
actin responses, migration, and membrane blebbing. Lastly, in Aim 3, we ask how loss of CasL affects T cell
migration into inflamed tissue in vivo. Taken together, these studies will provide fundamental information on the
mechanisms of T cell migration and mechanotransduction and lay the foundation for future work aimed and
manipulating these pathways in inflammatory diseases and cancer."
10945401,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of this project is to investigate the upper airway molecular and clinical predictors of systemic relapse
in antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV). AAV is a multi-organ rheumatic
disease with prominent upper airway involvement that often precedes disease in other organs. Relapses are
common and difficult to predict, resulting in long-term use of immunosuppressive therapies. There is a critical
need to understand the events leading up to relapse which may provide new insights into early processes which
incite or amplify autoimmune responses as well as facilitate development of prognostic biomarkers which can
inform treatment decision (e.g., escalate or de-escalate systemic immunosuppressive therapy). This proposal is
based on preliminary data indicating that, in patients with AAV who are in clinical remission, nasal gene
expression and bacterial profiling identifies epithelial and microbial alterations which are detectable 6 months
prior to systemic disease relapse, even in patients without sinonasal symptoms at relapse and regardless of
immunosuppressive therapy. Similarly, when examining upper airway disease using a patient-reported outcome
measure, the SinoNasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22), greater sinonasal symptom burden was associated with
a 3-fold higher risk of relapse within 2 years. The central hypothesis is that, among patients with quiescent
AAV, there exists a relapse-prone disease state that is detectable using a combination of molecular profiling,
clinical, and patient-reported measures. This project will perform a longitudinal cohort study by leveraging an
existing upper airway-dedicated biorepository of AAV (banked nasal samples from 847 visits in 191 patients) as
well as prospectively recruit 150 new patients at a major vasculitis-focused clinical and research center. Also,
longitudinal collection of patient-reported data will be electronically captured in 300 patients through the Vasculitis
Patient-Powered Research Network, a national research network with over 2,000 highly engaged patients with
AAV. The specific aims are to: (1) define molecular changes in the upper airway that precede relapse of AAV
using high-throughput sequencing, and (2) define the patient-reported upper airway symptoms preceding relapse
of AAV and the added value of clinical and molecular data to identify the relapse-prone subgroup. We will
evaluate the contribution of each data type as well as combine data using machine learning approaches to train
and validate a prediction model of relapse within 2 years. Using integrative multi-omic analyses, we will identify
biologically distinct subtypes of patients who are in clinical remission. The long-term translational objective is to
use the biologic insights gained in this study to create reliable prognostic biomarkers which inform treatment
decision-making (e.g., escalate/maintain vs de-escalate immunosuppressive therapy) as well as gain
mechanistic insights in this highly-morbid, relapsing rheumatic disease. By investigating the transition from
quiescent to active disease, the proposed work will advance our understanding of disease progression in AAV
and uncover a new area of investigation which may be applicable to other rheumatologic conditions."

Fewer US Latina girls meet current physical activity (PA) guidelines, with lower rates observed among those
from lower-income and less-acculturated backgrounds, contributing to widespread health disparities. PA
interventions in the pre-pubertal phase (ages 8-11) can help mitigate the sharp decline in PA during
adolescence. Multilevel interventions involving mothers and their preadolescent daughters hold great promise,
but prior studies lack objective outcomes and long-term follow-up. Our team recently completed R21 pilot
feasibility trial and additional formative research showing increases in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity
(MVPA) among Latina mother-daughter dyads following a 12-week multilevel intervention, Conmigo. Building
on these findings, we will conduct a two-arm cluster RCT in 18 schools serving Latina girls aged 8-11 to test
Conmigo compared to a similar attention control nutrition program, both delivered by YMCA staff. Using a
Hybrid-Type 1 effectiveness implementation design, we will use mixed methods to evaluate both effectiveness
and implementation outcomes. At the individual level, girls will attend PA classes and learn behavioral
strategies to support daily PA habits. At the family level, mothers will be engaged in the intervention to support
their daughters through PA parenting strategies and improved family communication around health behaviors.
Multilevel implementation strategies aim to increase community organizations' capacity to implement Conmigo
and strengthen partnerships between 9 YMCAs and 18 schools. PA will be measured by accelerometry in the
daughters and mothers (n=216 dyads) at baseline, 3, 9, and 15 months. Interviews will be conducted with
participants, program staff, and school and YMCA leaders to identify benefits, barriers, and facilitators to future
widespread adoption. Specific Aims are: To test the effectiveness of Conmigo on daughters' MVPA over time
(Aim 1); evaluate individual (e.g., mothers’ MVPA) and family level (e.g., mother-daughter communication)
mechanisms of change and their bidirectional effects (Aim 2); and use qualitative and quantitative methods to
evaluate implementation outcomes and barriers and facilitators of these outcomes (Aim 3). This study will
improve the rigor of research on Latina dyads where the influence of family and gender roles may be strong.
This study will advance implementation science by evaluating strategies to improve community coalitions by
partnering in program implementation."
10950412,"The United States is battling a drug overdose crisis fueled by deaths from the synthetic opioid fentanyl and,
more recently, the veterinary sedative xylazine, an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist drug. A better
understanding of the toxicity caused by these drugs, alone and in combination, will guide strategies to prevent
and to medically manage victims of these drugs. Fentanyl causes death through respiratory depression,
however little is known how or if xylazine and fentanyl interact to produce additional toxicity. By itself, xylazine
in both humans and animals, causes sedation, respiratory depression, hypotension, bradycardia, and
hypothermia. In Aim 1, therefore, we will quantify the impact of fentanyl on xylazine-induced hypotension,
bradycardia, and respiratory depression in rats. Because fentanyl causes skeletal muscle rigidity and airway
compromise/glottic closure, which may further impair breathing, and, because other alpha-2 adrenergic
receptor agonist drugs (e.g., dexmedetomidine) inhibit opioid-induced rigidity, we will also measure xylazine
skeletal muscle effects. Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist drugs, like other sedatives and anesthetics,
impair thermoregulation and decrease thermogenesis and metabolism, which promotes hypothermia. We
hypothesize xylazine causes marked hypothermia through similar mechanisms and will test this in Aim 2.
Xylazine is also associated with skin wounds in intravenous drug users. Because hypothermia is known to
impair wound healing and to increase wound infection rates, we further hypothesize xylazine-induced
hypothermia, perhaps exacerbated by fentanyl/opioid use, may be contributing. To test this last hypothesis, in
Aim 2 we will determine xylazine, fentanyl, and systemic warming effects in an established rodent
contaminated wound healing model."

 One of the most recent and significant public health problems deals with addressing vaccine hesitancy and
mis/disinformation. As new types of vaccines become effective and available, and bundled together, it
becomes increasingly important that researchers and health departments learn how to best communicate to
the public the correct science behind vaccines. Black/African American and Latinx populations might be
especially impacted by misinformation due to health inequity and low health literacy.
 However, despite extensive exposure to vaccine mis- and disinformation, many Blacks and Latinx are
resilient to misinformation and still choose to get vaccinated. This application takes a unique approach in
leveraging that positive outcome by identifying the predictors of Black and Latinx individuals who are frequently
exposed to misinformation, yet demonstrate broad vaccine acceptance for different vaccine types.
 Many factors play a role in vaccine acceptance/hesitancy, including social media and social networks, as
well as traditional multi-level factors such as mental health, political ideology, stigma, access to health
services, trust in the healthcare system, and educational opportunities. Our team has conducted extensive
research on the factors influencing attitudes and behaviors among Black and Latinx populations, for COVID-19
vaccine uptake, as well as ways to use digital data and tools to gain insights and intervene to improve them. In
this study, we seek to use similar artificial intelligence methods on social media, social network, and other
multi-level data to identify factors influencing vaccine acceptance among Black and Latinx populations.
 We seek to enroll 500 Black and Latinx individuals who are Twitter (X) followers of known vaccine-hesitant
influencers. We will collect baseline, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up data on participants’ vaccine acceptance;
misinformation exposure; perceptions about vaccines, including willingness to receive future vaccines or enroll
in a vaccine clinical trial; digital contextual data (e.g., social media content; social network ties; and other multi-
level factors associated with vaccine knowledge and acceptance (e.g., political ideology, medical distrust,
structural factors). We will study the factors affecting acceptance of vaccines. We will also develop a tool to
visualize the data to inform researchers about how to add these new data/approaches to surveillance efforts.
Specifically, we seek to 1) Identify the relationship between social media data and vaccine acceptance among
Black and Latinx followers of influencers spreading vaccine-hesitant information, 2) Examine the influence of
social network factors on vaccine acceptance, and 3) Develop a visualization tool to graph and map contextual
data (e.g., social media content and geographic and network location of social network ties)."
10946299,"ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) Transporters are paradigmatic molecular machines that use ATP binding and
hydrolysis to power transmembrane transport of diverse substrates. Knowledge of their mechanism comes
primarily from static structures of stable intermediates along the transport cycle. We recently developed a single-
molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) system that exploits quenching by vitamin B12 to
track its physical movement in real time during ATP-driven transport by nanodisc-reconstituted E. coli BtuCD-F,
a mechanistically enigmatic type II ABC importer. Our smFRET quenching (smFRET-Q) measurements
demonstrate that BtuCD-F employs a novel mechanism in which transmembrane translocation of B12 is driven
by high-energy intermediate conformations that have short, sub-second lifetimes making them inaccessible to
standard structural methods. The first conformational change, which is dynamically driven by hydrolysis of a
single ATP molecule, moves B12 from its periplasmic binding site into the transmembrane domain, while the
second, which is driven by the formation of a hyper-stable complex between the BtuCD and BtuF subunits,
delivers B12 to the cytoplasm. Hydrolysis of a second single ATP molecule then dynamically drives dissociation
of BtuCD from BtuF to restore the transporter to the starting conformation. One novel feature of this mechanism
is that the homodimeric ATPase and transmembrane domains progress through a fundamentally asymmetrical
conformational reaction cycle in which the powerstroke is driven by ATP hydrolysis rather than ATP binding. In
contrast, previously characterized superfamily members employ a two-fold symmetrical conformational reaction
cycle in which the powerstroke is driven by cooperative ATP binding, while ATP hydrolysis gates relaxation back
to the conformational ground-state. Our smFRET-Q methods have thus provided unprecedented information on
the mechanism of a paradigmatic transport process while visualizing translocation of single substrate molecules
in real time. We now propose to harness their high functional and temporal resolution to elucidate how the protein
sequence controls the key conformational changes dynamically driving B12 transport by BtuCD-F. We will use
double mutant-cycle analyses to investigate how packing interactions in the transmembrane domains control the
conformational landscape and furthermore how local electrostatic interactions in the ATPase active site are
propagated into directional progression through functional trajectories in that landscape. These studies will be
guided by advanced protein primary sequence analysis methods including analyses of evolutionary correlations
between pairs of amino acids. The high resolution of the methods we will use to characterize the mutant proteins
will elucidate the structural mechanism by which ATP hydrolysis by a paradigmatic protein nanomachine controls
functional protein dynamics to efficiently perform mechanical work on a molecular size scale. These studies will
moreover provide insight into how protein dynamics constrains protein evolution while simultaneously testing
methods to harness cutting-edge sequence-analysis methods to gain insight into functional protein dynamics."

You can point the door of the room with your eyes closed. Patients with certain brain lesions cannot, although
they can point to it if they can see it. Establishing a spatially accurate memory of visual space requires solving
a classic problem in cognitive neuroscience: to understand how the brain changes a retinal signal, arising from
a constantly moving eye, into a spatially accurate signal for memory, perception, and action. Two pioneering
neuroscientists suggested different solutions to this problem. Hermann von Helmholtz postulated that the brain
achieves spatial accuracy by feeding the motor command for an eye movement back to the visual system, to
compensate for an impending saccade, and thus maintain a spatially accurate representation of the visual world,
a process now known as corollary discharge. Sir Charles Sherrington postulated that oculomotor proprioceptors
could measure the position of the eyes in the orbit, and where the head is on the body, to use these data to
calculate the spatial location of visual objects. There is physiological evidence for both viewpoints: when a
monkey plans a saccade, neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) respond to stimuli not in their receptive
fields, but which will be brought into their receptive fields by the planned saccade, which must involve a corollary
discharge because the receptive fields change before the eye moves. In contrast, eye position modulates the
visual responses in LIP, the gain fields, and from this, it is simple to calculate target position in craniotopic
coordinates. When humans are asked to make memory-guided saccades after a number of intervening
saccades, their error increases linearly after the each of the first 3 saccades, implying the use of a corollary
discharge mechanism. However, the error becomes stable after 6 or 7 saccades, implying that the brain has
switched to a stable, craniotopic representation of space, which could use gain fields. LIP neurons have
retinotopic receptive fields, but exhibit environmental memory, showing these retinotopic receptive fields have
access to a gaze invariant representation of space. There is a representation of eye position in Area 3a of
somatosensory cortex, which arises from sensors in the contralateral eye. Our preliminary data suggest that
this area is necessary for both gain fields in LIP and for the establishment of long-term spatial memory, but not
for the short-term corollary discharge mechanism. This proposal takes these discoveries as the starting point
for three aims: 1) we will use inactivation of Area 3a to study its role in the establishment of gain fields, long-term
spatial memory, and environmental memory in LIP. 2) LIP projects to the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), which
then projects to posterior entorhinal cortex (PEC). We will categorize cell types in parahippocampal gyrus (PHG),
and examine the role of oculomotor proprioception in the spatial properties of PHG neurons 3) PEC has a class
of cells, grid cells, from which the hippocampus can build its cognitive map. We hypothesize that oculomotor
proprioception is necessary for construction of grid cells. These results support the novel suggestion that
somatosensory deficits cause spatial memory deficits in humans and non-human primates."
10944132,"Women with high-risk breast lesions, such as atypical hyperplasia (AH) and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS),
have up to a 4- to 10-fold increased risk of invasive breast cancer (BC) compared to women with non-proliferative
breast disease. Chemoprevention with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and aromatase
inhibitors (AIs) have been shown in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to reduce BC incidence by up to 50-65%
among high-risk women, with a 70-80% relative risk reduction among women with AH or LCIS. However,
chemoprevention uptake remains low at <15%. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is also common in women, and
HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, or “statins,” are used for primary prevention, with a relative risk reduction of
~25% for major vascular events. About half of eligible U.S. patients are currently on a statin for primary prevention
of CVD. This contrasts with less than 15% of eligible high-risk women taking chemoprevention. While numerous
studies have been conducted to elucidate the complexities in BC chemoprevention decision-making, no studies
have been conducted within the context of preventive therapy for CVD. In this project, we will investigate where
and why, on the patient's journey from understanding their risk to discussing risk-reducing medications with their
provider, there is a divergence resulting in lower uptake of BC chemoprevention relative to the use of statins for
CVD. Using iterative equity-focused human-centered design, we will uncover differences in the decision-making
process (SERMs/AIs vs. statins), compare why a woman may opt out of SERMS/AIs as a preventive measure
but opt-in for statins, and explore if women can benefit from calibrating the chemoprevention decision-making
process in the context of more familiar statin preventive therapy for CVD. We developed and rigorously evaluated
decision support tools, RealRisks for patients and BNAV for primary care providers (PCPs), in RCTs, to increase
chemoprevention and genetic testing among high-risk women. In this proposal, we will refine these decision-
support tools based on a deeper understanding of chemoprevention uptake in the context of preventive therapy
for CVD. Our hypothesis is that the equity-focused human-centered design process, which is designed to
enhance understanding of low adoption of chemoprevention by contrasting decision-making with that of
individuals at risk of CVD, can clarify barriers and improve chemoprevention uptake. Specific aims are to 1) apply
human-centered design to refine RealRisks and BNAV for BC and CVD; 2) conduct a cluster randomized trial
with randomization of 60 PCPs to standard educational materials alone or combined with patient and provider
decision support to improve chemoprevention uptake among 200 racially/ethnically high-risk women, age 40-74
years; and 3) conduct an equity-focused evaluation of intervention implementation. This proposal addresses a
significant public health problem given the burden of BC and CVD mortality, particularly among racial/ethnic
minorities. It has the potential to illuminate previously unaddressed barriers to chemoprevention decision-making
in the context of interventions used to treat or prevent other chronic conditions, such as statins for CVD."
10944073,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Germline loss-of-function mutations in the RUNX1 gene cause a familial platelet disorder with a predisposition
to the development of myeloid malignancy (RUNX1-FPDMM). RUNX1 encodes a sequence-specific
transcription factor that regulates critical hematopoietic gene expression programs. Consistently, mouse
models of Runx1 deletion have revealed critical roles in definitive hematopoiesis, platelet production, stem cell
function, and the development and function of both myeloid and lymphoid cells. However, while mouse models
have defined critical Runx1 knockout phenotypes, it has been difficult to define the Runx1 target genes that
underlie these phenotypes. This is because, while transcription is a highly dynamic process changing within
minutes, Runx1 conditional knockout models (germline deletion is embryonic lethal) allow tissues to develop in
the absence of the Runx1 protein resulting in the accumulation of both direct as well as indirect and
compensatory changes in gene expression. In order to overcome this limitation and define the mechanism of
RUNX1 function, we have engineered the endogenous RUNX1 locus with a degron tag. This technology allows
the rapid removal of the RUNX1 proteins within 1-2 hours of treatment with the small molecule, dTAG, thus
collapsing the timeframe for studying RUNX1-mediated transcriptional changes from weeks to hours. Using
this technology in cell lines, we have identified complex mechanisms of RUNX1-mediated transcriptional
control, which suggest that RUNX1 collaborates with a number of other sequence-specific transcription factors
and co-regulatory proteins to regulate hematopoietic gene networks. Importantly, some of these factors (e.g.,
FLI1, GATA1, GATA2) are also associated with germline mutations that cause either familial thrombocytopenia
or predisposition to malignancy, suggesting that these factors may contribute to similar phenotypes by
converging on an overlapping gene network. Here we propose to understand the cooperative and/or
antagonistic nature of these proteins on RUNX1 gene expression networks. At the same time, in order to
uncover how Runx1 transcriptional control contributes to hematopoietic development, we will complement
these cell-based models with the first Runx1dTAG mouse model. This model will allow in vivo and ex vivo
characterization of the direct consequences of acute Runx1 depletion on HSPC transcription and cell fate
decisions. Combined, these studies will define mechanisms by which RUNX1 cooperates with other
transcription factors to fine tune hematopoietic gene expression programs and will determine how Runx1
controlled transcriptional programs facilitate distinct lineage choices to maintain normal hematopoiesis.
Importantly, the mechanistic insights provided by these studies will shed light on the molecular underpinnings
of RUNX1-FPDMM."
10944134,"The goal of this research program is to develop robust and flexible dual-duration, multi-
wavelength fiber sources of light for nonlinear and multimodal imaging with orders of magnitude
signal enhancement over the state of the art. Nonlinear imaging enables label-free, deep, and
diffraction-limited imaging in living tissue through a variety of nonlinear interactions that are each
sensitive to specific molecules, symmetries, and structures, including two-photon excitation
fluorescence (2PEF), second- and third-harmonic generation (SHG and THG), and Raman-
sensitive techniques such as coherent anti-Raman scattering (CARS). Moreover, combining
these largely orthogonal modalities yields a rich combination of molecular, structural, and
functional information which has been demonstrated for diagnosing atherosclerosis, neurological
diseases, and cancer, including revealing new biomarkers and clinically relevant signatures
absent even from histologically processed tissue. However, each imaging modality requires
specific and incompatible pulse parameters that cannot be achieved with current ultrashort pulse
technology without sacrificing orders of magnitude in imaging signal strength. This proposal will
establish a new suite of technologies for ultra-short pulse generation that no longer rely on
traditional mode-locked laser-based systems. Building from recent proof-of-concept
demonstrations from the PIs, this research targets flexible and efficient fiber sources of inherently
synchronized multi-wavelength picosecond and femtosecond pulses specific for each nonlinear
imaging modality, with the ability to generate them simultaneously for multimodal imaging. The
research program is based on three Aims: (1) Developing diode-laser driven fiber time-lens
picosecond sources that are efficiently wavelength shifted with fiber parametric amplification for
flexible, multiwavelength picosecond sources; (2) Developing Kerr resonators for femtosecond
pulse generation with high efficiencies and the energy and wavelength flexibility ideal for nonlinear
imaging; and (3) Establishing dual-duration multi-wavelength sources adapted for background
suppressed CARS imaging and 2PEF, SHG, and THG, and demonstrating these sources for
multimodal imaging with unprecedented speeds and contrast using existing multiphoton
microscopes and a commercial microscope system to demonstrate the potential for widespread
adaptation. Our aim is to enable a significant advance for nonlinear and multimodal imaging
contrast and depth at real-time frame rates with a novel source that is low-cost and more
accessible than previous technologies. Successful completion of this program will have major
impact for biomedical research as well as clinical applications of ultrashort-pulse imaging."
10945142,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Many older adults who are hospitalized for heart failure (HF) lose their ability to independently perform activities
of daily living and then require long-term custodial care in a nursing home—an outcome that many seniors fear
more than death. Yet, research to date on post-hospitalization outcomes has focused on readmission and
mortality, and has overlooked important patient-centered outcomes like functional recovery and return to one’s
own home. Understanding which factors promote functional recovery is critically necessary. Medications are one
of the most easily modifiable potential factors, yet their effects on functional recovery are not well-understood.
Thus, the overarching objective of this proposal is to examine the impact of medications on functional recovery
and successful transition back to home following a HF hospitalization. The proposed research will focus on older
adults discharged to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) after HF hospitalization because: 1) nearly one in five patients
require SNF care following HF hospitalization; and 2) patients requiring SNF care are most vulnerable to
prolonged functional impairment, loss of independence, and the need for long-term custodial care. The central
hypothesis is that many commonly prescribed medications may impair participation in rehabilitation, interfere
with functional recovery, and/or decrease the likelihood of successful discharge to home from SNFs. This
hypothesis will be tested through three specific aims employing a series of rigorous observational studies: Aim
1, Estimate the effects of HF-specific and other medications administered in SNFs, including dose and duration,
on function and successful discharge to home after HF hospitalization (outcomes), and examine potential
mediators like rehabilitation minutes and cognition; Aim 2, Develop a novel risk score for the cumulative effects
of harmful medications that interfere with function and successful discharge to home after HF hospitalization,
and validate its predictive performance for key outcomes and mediators; Aim 3, Quantify individual medication
and cumulative medication burden effects on function and successful discharge to home across important pre-
defined subgroups of older adults with HF, including by dementia status and varying degrees of frailty,
multimorbidity, and polypharmacy. To accomplish the three proposed aims, a large innovative database of SNF
electronic health record information will be leveraged along with national Minimum Data Set 3.0 clinical
assessment records, Medicare claims, Veterans Health Administration data, and other unique datasets. The
proposed research is highly significant because it will provide foundational evidence for developing interventions
to optimize medication use patterns (via prescribing and deprescribing) and subsequently facilitate functional
recovery after HF hospitalization. This research directly addresses the National Institute on Aging's Strategic
Goal C to improve the safe use of medications."
10948018,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with a 28-day
mortality as high as 30-40%. However, there are no effective pharmacologic interventions specifically
targeted at ARDS pathogenesis that improve outcomes. An unrestrained innate immune response in the
lungs contributes to the pathogenesis of ARDS. Cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14) is a key activator of
innate immunity in response to infection and products of tissue injury. Targeting innate immunity by blocking
CD14 could regulate host response to infection and tissue injury, thereby reducing immunopathology and
improving clinical outcomes. In recent years, COVID-19 emerged as a prevalent cause of ARDS and the
innate immune hyperinflammatory milieu observed in this specific form of ARDS echoes that of the broader
ARDS population. CD14-blockade with the novel monoclonal antibody IC14 was studied for the treatment of
severe COVID-19 in two small clinical trials. While these studies were not powered to detect differences in
clinical outcomes, there was a trend suggesting a potential mortality benefit, and IC14 exhibited on-target
pharmacodynamic and biological effects. Additionally, a biologically credible CD14-pathway biomarker,
presepsin, a soluble fragment of CD14, was found to be a potential predictor IC14 treatment response.
Dr. Mabrey's proposal aims to build upon the encouraging results observed in COVID-19 by examining CD14 as
a potential therapeutic target in ARDS through three Specific Aims: (1) Determine the effects of IC14 on cellular
targets through analysis of blood leukocyte bulk RNA sequencing data from the I-SPY COVID trial. (2) Determine
the relationship between presepsin and key clinical parameters in ARDS. (3) Conduct a Pilot randomized trial of
IC14 treatment for ARDS to test lung-specific effects and to determine the feasibility of incorporating rapid
presepsin measurements.
The Career Development Plan for this grant proposal is designed to provide training in the analysis of high
dimensional molecular data, novel clinical biomarker evaluation, and design and conduct of clinical trials
integrating translational elements. These new skills will augment her background in epidemiology and facilitate
her overall goal of developing into an independent clinical and translational physician-scientist who can use
translational research as a platform to conduct biologically-grounded clinical trials in patients with ARDS. Armed
with the data generated by this project as well as the training outlined in the Career Development Plan, Dr.
Mabrey will have the infrastructure and skills necessary to submit a competitive R01 grant proposal at the end
of her proposed K23 funding period. Future projects will build upon results from these proposed studies and
could include a Phase II clinical trial testing IC14 treatment in ARDS with a biomarker-based precision medicine
component, investigation of novel CD14-pathway biomarkers discovered through this project, and collaboration
with other ARDS investigators to examine other emerging pharmacotherapies."
10950517,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Objective. Our objective is to build on our preliminary work that demonstrates a modified dietary
approaches to stop hypertension (modDASH) eating plan combined with a standard exercise program will be a
better overall treatment for patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) to improve walking, local microvascular
function, and vascular inflammation.
 Specific Aims. We propose to test the efficacy of a modDASH dietary program combined with an
exercise program (modDASH+Ex) to improve exercise and vascular outcome measures in patients with PAD
and claudication beyond that of the standard treatment of an exercise program (Ex). Our central hypothesis is
that the modDASH+Ex program improves the efficacy to rehabilitate PAD patients by improving exercise
outcomes, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), local microvascular function, and vascular inflammation more
than the standard Ex program. This clinically relevant hypothesis will be tested through the following aims:
 Aim 1 (Exercise Outcomes). To compare the changes in ambulation and HRQoL in PAD patients
following the combined modDASH+Ex program, and following the Ex program which represents standard of care
treatment.
 Aim 2 (Local and Systemic Vascular Outcomes). To compare the changes in local microvascular
function of the lower extremities and inflammation in patients following the combined modDASH+Ex program, and
following the Ex program.
 Aim 3. To explore the causal mechanism that changes in local microvascular function and vascular
inflammation are physiologic mechanisms that precede changes in ambulation following the modDASH+Ex
and Ex programs, and whether changes are more predictive following modDASH+Ex program.
 Methods. This is a 3-month, patient-oriented, translational, comparative effectiveness randomized
controlled trial. A total of 184 patients will be randomized into either the modDASH+Ex program (N=92) or the Ex
program (N=92). All patients will perform home-based walking for 3 months, and patients randomized to the
modDASH+Ex program will progressively increase their daily servings of fruits and vegetables by up to 3-4
servings above baseline during the program.
 Clinical Significance. If successful, combining the modDASH eating plan with a home-based exercise
program will be a novel and innovative behavioral paradigm to optimally improve peak walking time, HRQoL, local
microvascular function and vascular inflammation in PAD patients. These improvements could impact the clinical
course of PAD by reducing long-term risks of major adverse cardiovascular and lower extremity events."
10948002,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
One of the fundamental challenges in modern biology is to decode the functionalities of human genome
sequence. Over the past decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have generated a wealth of new
information, including the genotype–phenotype associations in various diseases and traits. Despite clear
successes in identifying novel disease susceptibility genes and in translating these findings into clinical care,
GWAS has been criticized for the fact that most association signals reflect variants and genes with no direct
biological relevance to phenotype. The development of large language model (LLM) has been the main driving
force behind many recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence. Research into the “genomic LLM” therefore has
the potential to significantly advance our understanding of how the genetics variants lead to the changes in
phenotypes by disrupting the underlying regulatory syntax of DNA. The Research Training Plan will first develop
and improve the core technologies of genomic LLMs to deepen our understanding on understanding the complex
regulatory mechanisms in gene regulation (Aim 1). The developed genomic LLMs will then be applied in imaging
genetics studies where imaging traits are used as phenotypes (Aim 2) and the development of new machine
learning (ML) approaches for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis (Aim 3). In Aim 1, the applicant Dr. Qiao Liu will
develop new genomic LLM techniques and provide biological model interpretation with special focus on how
transcription factor (TF) binds DNA recognition sites in genomic regulatory regions to control genomic
transcription and affect epigenomic signals in a context-specific manner. The proposed genomic LLMs will serve
as solid foundation for both Aim 2 and Aim 3. In Aim 2, Dr. Liu will focus on the imaging genetics studies, which
can be considered as GWAS of imaging phenotypes, for linking genetic variants/genes to structural or functional
imaging features through the mediation of genomic LLMs. Genomic LLMs thus will bridge the gap between
personal genetics and radiomics. In Aim 3 during the R00 phase, Dr. Liu will develop new ML approaches on
AD diagnosis by considering the causal genetic-imaging-clinical pathways and leveraging the power from the
genomic LLM. To succeed in these aims, a Career Development Plan is tailored to enable Dr. Liu to gain new
knowledge and skills in radiomics, neuroimaging, and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as career skills through
practice and coursework with the support of the outstanding mentoring team and scientific advisory committee.
Stanford University is an ideal environment, providing all of the facilities needed for the proposed research and
a rich interdisciplinary environment for collaborative studies. In summary, the strong mentoring team and
scientific advisory committee, as well as the training plan are anticipated to fully prepare Dr. Liu to launch his
independent career. The proposed studies promise to offer mechanistic insights into both genetics and radiomics,
and may help uncover important genetic-imaging-clinical pathways for better understanding complex diseases."

 Lifetime Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) has an estimated US lifetime prevalence of 29.1%.
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is often comorbid with AUD, with an estimated lifetime AUD
prevalence of 40.8% among those with lifetime MDD. This comorbidity was unequally
distributed by sex globally, with prevalence nearly twice as high in men as in women. AUD and
MDD are moderately heritable, with and a substantial proportion of the underlying genetic
liability between AUD and MDD is shared, (rg = 0.56). The temporal order of the disorders is
complex and likely differs by sex. This project proposes to leverage data from 10 existing
collections from longitudinal, diverse ancestry cohorts to analyze the interacting sex, genetic,
and co-morbid MDD effects on the trajectory of AUD. These analyses represent modeling
approaches not previously applied in these datasets and successful completion of the proposed
research will elucidate biological mechanisms of alcohol etiology by investigating sex-specific
and time-varying genetic influences on item-level measures of AUD. Importantly, this proposal
also includes development of novel machine learning (ML) approaches for predicting missing

of becoming an independent and innovative researcher in alcohol epidemiology. Combined with
her background in biostatistics and analytical methods, the proposed training and research
activities will develop her capacity posit the kinds of research hypothesis, comprehensive plans,

research will equip the candidate to establish a strong line of competitive research supporting a
long-term goal of an independent research plan that integrates novel statistical and
computational approaches to elucidate the genetic and environmental factors and interactions
contributing to AUD."
10949333,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Violations of our expectations result in prediction-error signals in the brain. When these prediction errors are
repeatedly experienced, they can influence our current affective state, mood, and ultimately behavior. Despite
this understanding, the brain circuits and patterns of activity within the circuits that translate these prediction
error signals into affective state fluctuations is unknown. Uncovering this is fundamental to gaining insight into
the neural basis of moods in healthy people, what becomes dysfunctional in pathological states like depression,
and for the development of new treatments that focally target these circuits. The experiment in this proposal will
combine high-density, multi-region, neurophysiology with state-of-the-art computational models to determine
neural and physiological biomarker of mood-like states in macaques. During the K99 phase of this proposal, I
will train with Drs. Rudebeck (primary mentor), Mayberg (co-mentor) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount
Sinai and Dr Rutledge (co-mentor) at Yale to test the hypothesis that a recent history of negative or positive
prediction errors will cause changes in affect through different subgenual cingulate cortex circuits that are specific
to the type of prediction violation encountered. This will be achieved by combining computational models of affect
with the simultaneous recording of activity across multiple limbic and prefrontal brain circuits while awake non-
human primates perform multiple different reward-based tasks that manipulate the recent history of prediction
errors. Next, I will focally target activity in these brain circuits using non-invasive transcranial focused ultrasound
aimed at subgenual cingulate cortex while concurrently recording activity from its interconnected brain areas.
The NIH K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award will give me the unique opportunity to receive a multi-
disciplinary and technical training under the K99 portion. This will include training in the acquisition and analysis
of single-neuron and population activity, computational modeling, and how insights from basic research can
influence the clinic. In addition, during this phase I will receive career-shaping training in how to lead my own
laboratory (i.e. managing people, writing a grant and networking), translate research from the laboratory to
clinical settings, apply to and obtaining a tenure rack position at a top-tier academic research institution. In the
R00 phase of the proposal I will combine neurophysiology with transcranial focused ultrasound to test the
hypothesis that causal manipulation of the history of reward prediction error in subgenual cingulate cortex
stabilize affective state fluctuations. The work proposed will provide strong preliminary data on the neural and
computational mechanisms of affect and a non-invasive ultrasound protocol to modulate neural activity within
these circuits data. This will be foundational for my lab’s first grant applications and to establish myself as a
successful principal investigator causally investigating the neural basis of affective states in healthy brains as
well as in disease."

Sexual and gender minority (SGM) adults disproportionately experience the burden of alcohol
use. Compared to cisgender straight individuals, SGM adults are more likely to drink heavily and
experience alcohol-related problems. Stressors—including discrimination and stigma—may
explain these disparities. Yet romantic partners may help to buffer against these stressors. The
current project examines how romantic relationships are associated with alcohol use among
SGM and cisgender straight couples. Data are drawn from the National Couples Health and
Time (NCHAT) study, a nationally representative dataset of cohabiting and married couples
collected between 2020-2021 that oversampled individuals in same-gender couples and
includes detailed measures for the main respondent (N=3,642), a separate survey of
spouses/partners (N=1,515), and appended measures of the broader state context. The study
has two primary aims. Aim 1 will examine whether romantic partnership characteristics (e.g.,
couple satisfaction, relationship risk, negative interaction) are associated with alcohol use (e.g.,
alcohol-related coping, heavy drinking, alcohol problems). We will examine whether patterns
differ for cisgender straight and SGM couples (i.e., between-person differences) as well as
examine associations separately for gay men, lesbian women, bisexual men and bisexual
women (i.e., documenting within-group associations). Aim 2 examines how discrimination
stressors—of individuals, partners, and broader contexts—shape alcohol use. We identify
resilience factors (e.g., emotional support, couple satisfaction) that buffer against the
association between stress and alcohol use for SGM adults. This aim will be tested using actor
partner interdependence models (APIM) within a multi-level modeling framework. Findings from
the rigorous secondary analyses of this unique, nationally-representative sample of SGM adults
will inform policy, identify potential harm reduction strategies, and help target intervention
programs to those who need them most."
10953973,"SUMMARY
In the United States, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is particularly high among American
Indian (AI) communities. Arsenic (As), a pervasive environmental contaminant disproportionately affecting AI
communities, may explain this increased risk. Arsenic induces oxidative stress and systemic low-grade
inflammation leading to β-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance in target tissues. However, the impact of As on
T2DM has been disputed due to a lack of coherent mechanism for these findings. Previous studies have focused
on epigenomic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation, histone modifications), overlooking downstream regulatory
mechanisms that can more directly shape phenotypes. We propose to investigate the RNA modification N6-
methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent epitranscriptomic modification on messenger RNA, which is directly
involved in the cellular stress response. In experimental systems, arsenic induces a m6A response. m6A also
modulates key processes underlying T2DM pathogenesis, including immune response and systemic
inflammation. m6A is controlled by a group of proteins called reader, writer, and erasers (RWEs), responsible for
adding, interpreting, and removing m6A marks. Fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) is one example
of an arsenic-sensitive m6A eraser with strong ties to T2DM and glucose homeostasis. Our pilot study in elderly
men exposed to low-level arsenic supported these findings. We propose to test the hypothesis that altered m6A
and RWEs are plausible mechanisms for As-related T2DM in the Strong Heart Study (SHS). The SHS is an
ongoing longitudinal study in AI communities in Arizona, Oklahoma, and North/South Dakota with detailed clinical
data for T2DM and metabolic syndrome (MetS). The SHS has measured speciated As exposure data covering
childhood and adult exposure windows, both independently associated with T2DM in previous research.
Leveraging the cohort design, exposure and phenotypic data, infrastructure, and study team, we propose to
conduct epitranscriptomic analysis of mRNA m6A profiles via m6A sequencing and measure mRNA expression
of 20 RWEs using whole blood from 1100 participants at the upcoming SHS follow up visit (scheduled for 2022-
23). Our specific aims are to: 1) determine the association of past and current As exposure with epitranscriptomic
profiles of m6A and RWEs mRNA expression levels in blood; 2) determine the association of blood m6A
epitranscriptomic profiles with metabolic markers and MetS, clinical T2DM prevalence, and T2DM control
(glycated hemoglobin, albuminuria); 3) develop a predictive m6A fingerprint that quantifies the risk of T2DM due
to As exposure using machine learning approaches. For aims 1 and 2 we will further use Mendelian
randomization to assess causal relationships. Characterization of m6A profiles in a population of AI adults highly
impacted by T2DM will reveal biological features linking a pervasive toxicant such as As to diabetes. In addition
to leading to interventions to reduce As exposure in the US and globally, defining the roles of m6A and RWEs in
T2DM may contribute to new targets for future diabetes therapies."

Black men experience extremely high levels of stress from unfavorable social and economic circumstances
resulting from structural racism, institutional discrimination, and unfair treatment. The accumulation and
manifestation of stressors can vary by the spatial contexts in which Black men live, play, work, and worship.
Residential areas are complex constructs that include physical and social attributes that influence health and a
small but growing number of researchers have examined the association between place and cognitive health.
Residential segregation can have implications for the health and well-being of Black men because place can
influence interactions between social environment, cumulative stress, and biological responses. Few studies
have examined Black men and cognitive impairment and no studies to our knowledge consider place, stress,
and their implications for cognitive status among this population. Our proposed study addresses this gap by
leveraging resources from the Johns Hopkins Alzheimer’s Disease Resource Center for Minority Aging and by
building on collaborations with its leaders to advance an emerging program of research founded on the NIA
Health Disparities Framework, Seeman and Crimmins biopsychosocial framework, and Diez Roux and Mair’s
neighborhood and health heuristic model. The objective of our study is to introduce and evaluate a theory-
driven conceptual model specifying how place has implications for the association between stress and
cognitive impairment among middle age and older Black men using data from the Health and Retirement Study
and U. S. Census. Knowledge gained from this small study can provide evidence for observational cohort
studies investigating the synergistic effects of individual and geographic factors on cognitive function, decline,
impairment, and premature mortality among Black men. Results from this work can inform future, risk reduction
interventions designed to preserve cognitive function, prevent cognitive impairment, and extend longevity
among middle age and older Black men."
10950983,"Abstract
 Extracellular matrix changes, metabolic reprogramming, glial hypertrophy, axon transport deficit, and
inflammation contribute to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon loss at the optic nerve head in glaucoma. Fibrosis
at the optic nerve head develops in response to the strain that is the result of increased intraocular pressure
observed in primary open angle glaucoma patients. However, the fibrosis becomes maladaptive as it impinges
upon the RGC axons that traverse the optic nerve head. Signaling pathways that regulate fibrosis intersect
with, and promote, specific metabolic pathways which in turn, modify the cytoskeleton and the extracellular
matrix. Therefore, a critical question is to what degree metabolic pathways dictate fibrotic changes in the optic
nerve head, and whether these pathways can be modified to resolve pathological fibrosis.
 The long-term goal of this work is to understand how metabolism and fibrosis intersect so that we may
promote survival of retinal ganglion cell axon structure and function in the optic nerve head. Our central
hypothesis is that glaucoma-associated extracellular matrix changes drive metabolism in optic nerve head
cells to promote continued fibrotic response. This hypothesis has emerged from our analysis of metabolic
change in optic nerve head astrocytes under glaucoma-associated stress, including indications that these cells
prioritize glutaminolysis, a key promoter of collagen synthesis. YAP/TAZ, two transcriptional co-activators that
are the final effectors for ECM-to-integrin signaling and have been implicated in glaucoma-associated fibrosis,
regulate the enzymes critical for glutaminolysis. Thus, promotion of a particular metabolic path is the result of
cellular mechanosensing in astrocytes, and allows those cells to continue to support the fibrotic response.
Resisting the raised intraocular pressure present at the optic nerve head as in glaucoma is the basis of the
fibrotic response, but the fibrosis eventually becomes a maladaptive positive feedback loop. Metabolic
reprogramming enables this positive feedback loop, so it is worth testing whether manipulating metabolism in
astrocytes and lamina cribrosa cells can limit the maladaptive response.
 We will test our hypothesis by 1) establishing that glutaminolysis in astrocytes and lamina cribrosa (LC)
cells of the optic nerve head is the result of YAP/TAZ transcriptional coactivation via extracellular matrix
signaling. We anticipate learning that astrocytes and LC cells prioritize glutaminolysis through YAP/TAZ
signaling to generate amino acids to be used for collagen synthesis. Secondly, we will interfere with
glutaminolysis in astrocyte and LC cells to test the suspected positive-feedback metabolic link to fibrosis. We
intend to show that metabolic pathways other than breakdown of glutamine will not facilitate the fibrotic
response of astrocytes and LC cells under glaucoma-associated strain. Establishing the necessity of specific
metabolic change to the fibrosis response of astrocytes and LC cells in the glaucomatous optic nerve head will
reveal a means by which fibrosis can be targeted to maintain retinal ganglion cell axon function and survival."

 Severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) can lead to permanent motor and cognitive deficits and often result
in exclusion from participation in society. Recovery of function through neurotherapy can continue years after
the injury. However, it is a slow process in a sterile environment and difficult to integrate into one’s life. For
decades, the concept of enriched environments, that is, scenarios that combine cognitive, social and physical
stimuli, have shown neuroplastic benefits in animal models. Recent calls have been made to translate
environmental enrichment to humans. Our long-term goal is to combine the principles of enriched
environments and vocational reintegration for an immersive therapy for adults with sTBI. This project continues
our work on the therapeutic café, a multimodal platform which combines therapies and first-phase vocational
training. In this proposed work, we will recruit chronic sTBI survivors to participate in a randomized controlled
pilot experiment that compares immersive therapy in the café to conventional physical and occupational
therapy. The participants in the immersive group will participate in a fully functioning kiosk located at the
MetroHealth Rehabilitation Institute cafeteria over a six-week training program under the supervision of a
therapist. The kiosk is equipped with a harness to protect from falls and is stocked with hot and cold
refreshments. Participants will interact with customers, collect payment, restock items and clean the area, all
with guidance from the therapist. The conventional therapy group will participate in physical and occupational
therapy for an equivalent duration as the immersive group. Our goal is to compare immersive to conventional
therapy to obtain preliminary data for a larger clinical trial. In Aim 1, we compare the differences in two therapy
strategies based on clinical measures of gait, balance, upper limb movement and function, and cognition. In
Aim 2, we examine the differences in physical activity between groups by quantifying limb and joint motion with
wearable sensors. We expect to find that for the same amount of motion, immersive therapy results in greater
improvements in clinical measures because it engages speech, cognition, and physical function in a real-world
manner. This work is important because it uses a randomized controlled trial to evaluate an innovative
motivating, real-world, vocational therapy option for people with the most severe level of TBI. This is innovative
as it is a completely new platform for combining therapeutic gains and community participation in this
population. The work also helps define how to quantify the amount of therapy activities and illustrates how it
can be used to understand the relationship between physical activity and clinical outcomes."

To measure the detailed function of neural networks in vivo, 2-photon population calcium imaging is widely
used, but has important limitations including low temporal resolution and poor single-spike detection. These
limit its ability to measure physiologically relevant activity patterns, particularly in cerebral cortex. A powerful
alternative is voltage imaging with genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs). Modern GEVIs have high
sensitivity and reduced bleaching, detect spikes with 1-2 ms time resolution, work under 2-photon (2p)
conditions, and report both subthreshold and spike signals. In this project, we optimize in vivo 2p imaging
methods for two modern GEVIs in somatosensory cortex (S1) of awake, behaving mice. We use conventional
2p resonance-galvo imaging in small fields, and free-space angular chirp-enhanced delay (FACED) 2p
imaging in larger fields (>100 neurons), both of which detect spikes at 1-2 ms resolution. Aim 1 optimizes
these methods for pyramidal cells and major interneuron types, and quantitatively calibrates optical spike
detection.
 Aim 2 applies these methods to study the dynamics and interactions of sensory and cognitive signals
in specific cell types in S1. Layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons mix rapid whisker touch signals (<10 ms resolution)
with slower cognitive signals (e.g., for decision or expectation). We will measure rapid sensory-evoked spike
and subthreshold dynamics in two functionally distinct, spatially intermixed pyramidal cell classes, in order to
test whether these represent distinct networks. We also study a cognitive signal, the response to unexpected
deviant (oddball) sensory stimuli, which is thought to be a long-latency, top-down signal. We study how this
cognitive signal interacts with rapid sensory signals in pyramidal networks, and how it recruits inhibitory
interneurons. This long-latency deviant response corresponds to the mismatch negativity (MMN) signal,
which is a widely used EEG biomarker for schizophrenia, and our results may reveal novel circuit
mechanisms for this signal.
 This project brings together the Feldman lab, with expertise in neural coding and circuit function in S1
cortex, and the Ji lab, with expertise in in vivo 2-photon imaging method development and GEVI imaging.
This early-stage project is based on an ongoing collaboration in which we have developed reliable methods
for 2-photon voltage imaging of whisker-evoked activity in S1 in vivo, using ASAP4.6-Kv, a high-sensitivity
GEVI developed by Michael Lin. Overall, this project will establish optimized methods for 2p GEVI imaging in
vivo, and use them to probe first-level questions about sensory and cognitive dynamics in S1 networks. In the
long run, 2p GEVI imaging promises to reveal network activity at millisecond time scales, revolutionizing our
understanding of cortical circuits in health and disease."

The α2-adrenergic receptor (α2R) agonist xylazine has been used in veterinary medicine for decades
owing to its anesthetic, muscle relaxant, and analgesic properties. Since the mid-2000’s however, illicit
use of xylazine has grown dramatically and over the last few years alone, the illicit use of xylazine-
adulterated opioids, including fentanyl, has increased exponentially. Xylazine use in humans is linked
to well-documented adverse effects including respiratory depression, hypotension, or bradycardia,
which can all be directly coupled to its mechanism as an α2R agonist. Significantly, repeated
intravenous injection of xylazine in humans has been associated with necrotizing skin ulceration that is
independent of bacterial etiology and is xylazine-specific. Despite the recent increase in illicit xylazine
use, the molecular mechanisms related to xylazine’s action at α2Rs remain poorly understood, as is
the mechanism of xylazine-mediated skin necrosis. This project is directly linked to the basic research
areas of interest in this Notice of Special Interest from NIDA. We hypothesize that xylazine exhibits
unique agonist binding and functional profiles at peripheral α2 and α1Rs and that its ulcerative effects
on the skin associated with intravenous injection are due to peripheral α2/α1R-mediated
vasoconstriction, which causes hypoperfusion and hypoxia upon repeated exposure leading to skin
necrosis. We propose three specific aims to address this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will assess the
binding affinity of xylazine compared to the structurally distinct αR agonists clonidine, moxonidine, α-
methylnorepinephrine and epinephrine at agonist-occupied conformations of each of the six α2/α1R
subtypes (α1A, α1B, α1D, α2A, 2B, 2C), expressed in translationally-relevant venous and arterial
smooth muscle cells (VSMC). In Aim 2, we will utilize novel TRUPATH G protein-biosensors in both
venous and arterial VSMC to assess the functional effects of xylazine compared to the other agonists
at α1A, α1B, α1D, α2A, α2B, and α2CRs engaged with differing Gαβγ combinations. This aim will inform
on xylazine-induced α1R/α2R signaling and will gauge distinct G protein bias that the agent may
possess, compared to the other α1R/α2R agonists. In Aim 3, we will directly test the hypothesis that IV
xylazine-induced skin necrosis in vivo is caused by a peripheral α2R-mediated mechanism associated
with vasoconstriction and resulting hypoperfusion and hypoxia. Together, these aims will fill gaps in the
literature related to xylazine binding and function in both venous and arterial VSMC as well as
mechanisms of IV xylazine-induced skin necrosis."

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) can effectively be a death sentence in sub-Saharan Africa where <2% of
patients with kidney failure have access to dialysis or transplantation. Biomarkers of immune activation (soluble
tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 [sTNFR1], tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFα], soluble urokinase
plasminogen activator receptor [suPAR]), and biomarkers of tubular injury (kidney injury molecule 1 [KIM-1]),
have been associated with CKD progression. However, few studies have investigated CKD biomarkers in
relation to APOL1 genotypes, and the findings in existing studies have been inconsistent. We do not know
whether there is subclinical evidence of tubular injury prior to decline in kidney function and how this differs for
high- vs low-risk APOL1 genotype carriers. Furthermore, we lack a clear understanding of how biomarkers of
immune activation may modify CKD progression in high-risk genotype carriers. We propose an R03 application
leveraging the Diet, CKD, and ApolipoproteinL1 (DCA) study which is an ancillary study to the Human
Hereditary and Health in Africa (H3Africa) kidney disease study. The DCA study has enrolled 738 individuals
with CKD in Nigeria and Ghana. DCA participants are being genotyped for APOL1 and have stored plasma
and 24hr-urine aliquots along with follow-up serum creatinine for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
and CKD progression. Our overall hypothesis is that inflammation and tubular injury are key factors in the
development and progression of APOL1-mediated kidney disease; to test this hypothesis, we will measure
biomarkers of inflammation and tubular injury in Africans with CKD and compare across low-and high-risk
APOL1 genotypes. Our specific aims are to: 1) Determine the cross-sectional associations of KIM-1, a
biomarker of tubular injury, with APOL1 high- compared to low-risk genotypes; 2) Determine the prognostic
significance of inflammation biomarkers in Africans with CKD across high- and low-risk APOL1 genotypes. The
R03 project will add critical elements to the DCA cohort and provide the PI, Dr. Ilori, with preliminary data for
future R01 applications focused on validating findings in larger cohorts and in new studies recruiting Africans
with high-risk genotypes without CKD. Using genomic data and biomarker data to phenotype individuals with
subclinical and overt kidney disease will advance precision medicine in CKD and will add to the evidence base
on mechanisms of APOL1-mediated kidney disease."
10946469,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Few children with recurrent neuroblastoma survive. New therapies, particularly immunotherapies, are badly
needed. Some promising results have recently been presented from neuroblastoma trials with a CAR T
therapy demonstrating that redirected T cell therapeutics have a promising role to play in the future. We
propose to redirect T cells to kill neuroblastoma cells using a multispecific T cell engager (MTE) that binds
ROR1, PD-L1, and CD3. ROR1 is targeted because it is expressed in most neuroblastoma patients’ tumors
and has been shown to be necessary for tumor initiation, migration, and other aggressive cancer features in
multiple types of cancer. PD-L1 is targeted because cells surrounding ROR1-positive cells that are being killed
by the MTE will upregulate PD-L1 in response to the interferon gamma that is released by the engaged T cells.
While PD-L1 upregulation is normally a defense mechanism against immune surveillance, our molecule
converts it into a cancer vulnerability because the more cancer cells upregulate PD-L1, the better T cells will be
able to engage and kill them due to the PD-L1 and CD3 binding motifs on the MTE. Concerns about on-target,
off-cancer toxicity due to PD-L1 expression on normal human tissues are mitigated by a recent human clinical
trial results showing that Davoceticept, an MTE that targets PD-L1, achieved good cancer control at doses that
were well tolerated in the clinical trial. We propose the following: Aim 1: Determine the extent to which patient-
derived neuroblastomas are vulnerable to R2P3 plus activated T cells. Aim 2: Determine R2P3 efficacy in
pediatric tumors that are heterogeneous for ROR1 expression. The innovation stems from co-targeting ROR1
and PD-L1, which addresses two common mechanisms of resistance to redirected T cell therapies, namely
target heterogeneity and upregulation of PD-L1. Further innovation relates to the MTE itself, which contains
single domain binders of ROR1, PD-L1, and CD3, which intends to overcome the manufacturing challenges
associated with heavy-light chain pairing. The significance of our proposal is that the molecule we have
designed could rapidly advance to human clinical trials for children with neuroblastoma and other pediatric
solid tumors (e.g., Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma) if the results from these studies
support further clinical development. Over a half century of failed clinical trials in recurrent neuroblastoma
patients has taught us that bold, creative, and thoughtful new approaches must be advanced."

Large Language Models (LLMs) represent the latest advancement in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
Artificial Intelligence (AI), holding tremendous potential to revolutionize biomedical and healthcare applications.
Extensive research has demonstrated the effectiveness of LLMs in a range of biomedical and health
applications, ranging from medical question answering to summarizing systematic reviews and AI-assisted
disease diagnosis. However, the major barriers to applying LLMs in biomedical and health applications are
factual incorrectness – where LLM-generated responses are inaccurate or incomplete – and unfaithful
reasoning – where LLM-generated responses lack supporting evidence, contradict existing evidence, or even
rely on hallucinated evidence. Such issues further pose the risk of propagating misinformation, potentially
leading to misdiagnosis or incorrect treatment recommendations. Addressing these issues has been
challenging, primarily due to three fundamental obstacles: (1) from the data perspective, LLMs may capture
misinformation from lower-quality or unauthorized sources in the general domain data during pretraining, lack
access to accurate and up-to-date biomedical knowledge, and consequently generate inaccurate, outdated, or
unfaithful results; (2) from the methods perspective, there is a lack of mechanisms for fact-checking and
evidence attribution throughout the lifecycle of LLMs when applied to biomedical and health studies, spanning
from training/fine-tuning to inference and post-hoc analysis; (3) from the accountability perspective, few
approaches have evaluated their effectiveness in biomedical and health downstream applications. Our overall
objective in this proposal is to systematically address the issue of factuality and unfaithful reasoning of LLMs in
biomedicine and healthcare. The specific aims include (1) from the data perspective, establishing a self-
augmentation framework to teach LLMs to automatically select and use relevant biomedical digital resources to
augment their responses; (2) from the methods perspective, developing an LLM curator by stimulating fact-
checking and evidence attribution performed in biocuration via a multi-stage, multi-task instruction tuning
pipeline; (3) from the methods perspective, introducing a step-level automated feedback-guided paradigm for
LLMs to reflect and improve from its intermediate responses via fact-checking and evidence attribution; and (4)
from the accountability perspective, evaluating the methods in downstream use cases. The proposed work is
expected to address factual incorrectness and unfaithful reasoning of LLMs – the key barrier to their use in
biomedical and health domains – and make LLMs generate accurate and trustworthy responses to advance
biomedical discovery and healthcare. It is also expected to refine the current development and evaluation
pipelines of LLMs in biomedical and health domains by making fact-checking and evidence attribution essential
components and providing related benchmarks, methods, and tools to facilitate the implementation."
10944090,"Project Summary/Abstract: Our long-term goal is to optimize stroke recovery by developing family-centered
rehabilitation interventions that support continued and progressive functional improvements in the stroke
survivor - without increasing caregiver burden. Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability, with the
majority of stroke survivors reporting prolonged difficulty using their affected upper extremity. Contrary to
expectations, upper extremity functional capacity improvement is not always reflected in stroke survivor activity
performance in daily life. Family carepartners play a key role in stroke survivor recovery and perseverance in
practicing upper extremity activities. However, carepartners often feel unprepared, experience high strain, and
reduced quality of life. To address this gap, we developed our theory-based family-centered intervention,
Carepartner and Collaborative Integrated Therapy (CARE-CITE), that uses well-established autonomy-
supportive strategies (characterized by empathy, choice, problem-solving, and reduced use of controlling
language) to engage carepartners during stroke survivor in-home rehabilitation activities. To positively motivate
stroke survivors to persist in upper extremity task practice, the carepartners learn how to create an autonomy-
supportive environment through instructional web-based modules that feature exemplary videos of family
scenarios practicing in-home rehabilitation activities. In virtual therapist-guided home training sessions, the
dyad and therapist-co-creates a tailored and progressive exercise program that integrates meaningful upper
extremity practice into daily activities of living. Across three preliminary studies, we have demonstrated good
recruitment, adherence, and safety, with strong content validity, high carepartner satisfaction, and low study
burden. Promising data for improvements in chronic and sub-acute stroke survivors showed clinically
meaningful improvements in upper extremity functional capacity and activity performance assessments, as well
as social participation. Carepartners showed reduced strain and family conflict with improved quality of life.
The goals of this R01 are to use a fully virtual, two-group randomized clinical trial (n=110 dyads) to test the
efficacy of CARE-CITE at two months and sustainability of improvements at 6 months compared to an
attention control group. The specific aims are to determine the effects of CARE-CITE on stroke survivor upper
extremity functional capacity (Aim 1), upper extremity daily activity performance (accelerometry and patient-
reported measures), and social participation (Aim 2). Additionally, we will evaluate the effects on carepartner
strain, conflict around stroke recovery, and quality of life (Aim3). Aligned with the NIH Research Plan on
Rehabilitation, the impact of this work is the development of innovative family-level interventions to improve
both stroke survivor and carepartner outcomes. Upon the successful study completion, our next goal will be to
translate this clinically feasible CARE-CITE intervention into current stroke systems of care; and to expand its
application for use in other disability-related conditions broadening public health impact."
10944092,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While current treatment approaches can cure most children diagnosed with cancer, chemotherapy-induced
cognitive impairment (CICI) has emerged as a significant medical problem with a negative impact on quality of
life. Given that more children with cancer now survive into adulthood, identification of biomarkers that can
predict and/or mediate susceptibility to cognitive decline, in conjunction to novel therapeutic interventions to
treat CICI, are urgently needed. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), the main nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NAD+) consuming enzyme, is activated by DNA damage and causes cellular NAD+ degradation,
contributing to neurodegeneration. Similarly, our preliminary studies demonstrate that various
chemotherapeutics including methotrexate, cisplatin and paclitaxel cause neuronal DNA damage, resulting in
increased cleavage of PARP1 expression in the adult mouse hippocampus and human excitatory neurons.
Remarkably, we further show that PARP1 inhibition through administration of a potent PARP1/2 inhibitor,
veliparib effectively prevents cisplatin-induced anxiety-like behavior and neurogenic defects. Taken together,
these observations strongly suggest that hyperactivation of PARP1 by chemotherapy causes NAD+ loss to
further impair neuronal and cognitive function. Based on these together with the fact that methotrexate, which
is routinely used for childhood cancers, also increases cleaved PARP1 expression, potentially mediating
neurotoxicity, we hypothesize that methotrexate-induced PARP1 hyperactivation causes cellular NAD+ loss,
an effect that can be prevented by inhibition of PARP1 activity, and thus ameliorating CICI. In addition, given
that NAD+ loss has proven to be a promising biomarker for the age-related neurodegenerative conditions, we
also propose to test the hypothesis that NAD+ and its associated metabolites can be novel biomarkers to
predict and/or mediate CICI. To address these hypotheses, Aim 1 will test if veliparib prevents methotrexate-
induced cognitive impairment in tumor-free and primary T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) juvenile
mouse models. In addition, given the importance of PARP1 signaling in cancer development, we will also
evaluate the impact of veliparib on tumor growth and chemotherapy’s anti-neoplastic activity using clinically
relevant T-ALL patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mice. Subsequently, using cell-type specific conditional PARP1
KO mice, Aim 2 will test which neural cell type is responsible for CICI. Moreover, we will also elucidate if NF-
kB-mediated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inflammatory signaling is a key downstream PARP1 effector driving
CICI. Lastly, Aim 3 will test if PARP1-dependent NAD+ metabolic pathway can be promising biomarkers that
can predict and/or mediate susceptibility to cognitive impairment in a cohort of ALL pediatric patients and
primary T-ALL juvenile mice. Our proposed translational work will provide critical mechanisms mediating CICI
and pave the way for transformative clinical interventions to ameliorate the cognitive disabilities associated with
chemotherapy, ultimately improving the quality of life for pediatric ALL and other cancer survivors."

The Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) for iron were first established in 2001, drawing upon the best available
data at that time. However, the committee was limited by the scarcity of studies, with data dating back to the
1950s and involving a relatively small number of subjects from homogenous populations outside the US.
Consequently, the existing DRIs for iron may not accurately reflect the needs of the increasingly diverse US
population. This proposed supplemental study to the Nutrition for Precision Health (NPH) trial powered by the
All of Us Research Program will determine dietary iron requirements in a representative sample of US adults.
The proposed study will recruit a large number of participants (n=~300) enrolled in NPH and collect data used
to determine iron requirements. Specific Aim 1 will quantify iron losses and Specific Aim 2 will determine iron
bioavailability from 3 different mixed diets typically consumed in the US. Factors affecting iron loss and iron
bioavailability will be explored. Indicators of iron status will also be added to the NPH protocol. These data will
serve as a crucial resource for informing the necessary updates to the current DRIs for iron, ensuring they
accurately reflect the specific needs of the US population. This study would not be possible without the larger
parent study, as it relies on the infrastructure, resources, and diverse participants recruited for the NPH trial.
Data will be integrated with the All of Us database to facilitate future discoveries that may inform public health
recommendations and strategies for preventing iron-related health conditions."
10946971,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The cornea is the most densely innervated tissue of the body, making it vulnerable to various insults and
neurosensory abnormalities that can lead to severe pain. Ocular pain is a very common complaint, and yet
its available management options remain quite limited.
 While “pain” in the acute sense has protective usefulness (signaling the host to limit exposure to noxious
stimuli), when protracted in the absence of ongoing insult, it can cause persistent tissue damage and induce
chronic neuropathic pain. Pathological ocular pain is often persistent, and is associated with low-grade chronic
inflammation, as observed in the highly prevalent condition of dry eyes or after corneal injuries (including
refractory surgery). We have been actively investigating the neuro-immune crosstalk at the ocular surface,
and our studies have demonstrated the critical involvement of the neuropeptide substance P (SP) and its
preferred receptor, neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R), in exacerbating corneal epitheliopathy through inducing
neurogenic inflammation in both cornea and trigeminal ganglions (TG) where the primary sensory neurons
for cornea are located. The SP/NK1R pathway is well known for mediating nociceptive pain, and its additional
functions in inducing neurogenic inflammation further evoke significant long-term genetic and molecular
changes that modify the electrophysiological characteristics of the peripheral terminals, parent axons, and
cell bodies of the primary sensory neurons, resulting in dysregulated transmission and processing of pain
signals thereby leading to chronic pain. Importantly, our preliminary studies have shown that topical NK1R
antagonist effectively suppresses acute ocular pain when given immediately after the insults in animals.
 In the current proposal, we hypothesize that topical NK1R antagonist is a non-addictive analgesic
capable of suppressing chronic ocular pain through disrupting SP-mediated both nociceptive pathway and
neurogenic inflammation that amplifies the vicious pain cycle. The principal objectives of this project are to
(i) assess the analgesic efficacy of NK1R antagonist in ocular pain, and (ii) determine the effects of NK1R
antagonist on the ocular surfaceꟷTG neurosensory pathway. To achieve these objectives, two specific aims
will be pursued: Aim 1: We will determine whether topical treatment with NK1R antagonist is effective in
reducing chronic ocular pain without causing addiction or ocular side effects; and Aim 2: We will assess the
effects of NK1R antagonist on modulating cellular and molecular activities within the ocular surfaceꟷTG
neurosensory pathway. Results from this study will help to validate a potential target in managing protracted
ocular pain, and thus lay a foundation for our next steps toward clinical translation. We will also establish a
multi-disciplinary team with the required expertise to prepare for the subsequent application from our team."

 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder
characterized by loss of motor neurons that leads to weakness, respiratory failure, and death
within 3-5 years of symptom onset. The importance of prognostic and pharmacodynamic
biomarkers in therapeutic development is highlighted by the emergence of neurofilament light
(NfL) and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy (pNfH) as potential neurodegenerative
biomarkers for ALS. Neurofilaments (NFs) are represented by three subunits: NfL, neurofilament
medium (NfM), and NfH that complex with -internexin in the central nervous system (CNS) or
peripherin in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). NFs undergo extensive post-translational
modifications (PTMs) (i.e. phosphorylation, O-glycosylation) that regulate neurofilament
assembly, transport, and function and are known to form pathologic aggregates in ALS. An
antisense oligonucleotide to SOD1, tofersen, was recently granted accelerated approval for
hereditary SOD1-ALS based on its ability to lower NfL and pNfH by immunoassay in serum and
CSF by ~60% at 12 weeks, long before clinical improvement was observed at one year.
However, immunoassay methods are vulnerable to non-specific signals and are unable to
discriminate between alternative isoforms or PTMs that may occur with disease. We have
developed a proteomic assay for NfL that has indicated NfL exists only as truncated fragments
in ALS CSF and have found that Coil 1 domain peptide species correlate best with ALS disease
progression. We have also developed reagents and methods to extend analysis to NfM and
NfH. By comparing neurofilament (NF) species in ALS and control biofluids, we anticipate that
we will identify NF isoforms and PTMs unique to ALS. We will also measure NF isoforms pre-
and post- tofersen treatment in blood and CSF from SOD1-ALS participants and compare their
performance to existing NfL and pNfH immunoassays. We recently demonstrated that stable
isotope labelling kinetics (SILK) can be safely employed in ALS participants and showed that
mutant SOD1A5V protein turnover is faster than its wild-type counterpart. In this study, we will
examine the effect of SOD1 lowering therapy on neuronal proteins, tau and NfL, and perform
proteomic analysis to assess changes in protein expression pre- and post-treatment. We
propose that in-depth proteomic and protein kinetic analysis of biofluids from the tofersen
treated SOD1-ALS population provides an unparalleled opportunity to uncover biomarkers
related to clinical improvement in ALS."
10944200,"Despite notable improvements in childhood cancer survival rates, patients with relapsed or refractory disease
face grim prospects, and childhood cancer remains the commonest cause of death from disease in children.
This program aims to tackle this issue, focusing primarily on the challenging pediatric cancer, high-risk
neuroblastoma (NB), a tumor of the sympathetic nervous system which accounts for up to 15% of childhood
cancer deaths and is the commonest solid tumor of young children. Recent research by our international
collaborative team has revealed a novel mechanism of cancer drug resistance linked to epigenetic activation of
LINE1 (L1) retrotransposons. We have provided preliminary evidence that these retrotransposons can be
effectively targeted by existing nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), offering a promising avenue
for repurposing these safe and effective antiviral agents as potential treatments for refractory tumors. While the
significance of retrotransposon activation has been established in various adult cancer types, a substantial
knowledge gap exists concerning its role in pediatric malignancies. Closing this gap is imperative, as controlling
retrotransposon activation with NRTIs, and potentially also with immunotherapeutic approaches, holds
substantial potential for significantly improving treatment outcomes for pediatric cancers, including refractory NB.
Our program seeks to explore the feasibility of retrobiome-targeted pharmacological and immunotherapeutic
strategies in NB. This exploration will be guided by a comprehensive assessment of retrotransposons’ activities
and their impact on tumor characteristics, in NB and also in all other solid tumors of childhood, employing a
unique and extensive range of preclinical models and clinical samples with associated comprehensive clinical
and molecular data. Our program capitalizes on a longstanding, fruitful collaboration between US and Australian
teams, drawing upon our complementary expertise in basic and translational science. We also build upon our
teams' foundational research on the epigenetic control of retrotransposons in cancer, their recognition by humoral
and T cell immunity, and the potential druggability of retrotransposon-induced malignant traits, particularly drug
resistance. Our specific aims are as follows: (SA1) to comprehensively characterize retrotransposon activity in
NB and other solid tumors of childhood, and assess its potential therapeutic and diagnostic significance, (SA2)
to investigate the impact of retrotransposon derepression on NB treatment resistance and the potential of reverse
transcriptase inhibitors to enhance refractory NB treatment outcomes in preclinical models and (SA3) to explore
immune responses to L1 retrotransposon antigens and evaluate the efficacy of anti-L1 immunotherapy in
preclinical NB models. The outcomes of the proposed program will guide the rational design of future
pharmacological and immunotherapeutic interventions for refractory NB and subsequently other poorly curable
pediatric cancers."
10944419,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Gender affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) is used by transgender (TG) people to alleviate gender dysphoria.
GAHT for male to female TG subjects (transwomen) consists of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist
(GnRHa) to block testosterone production and cross-sex hormone treatment (CSHT) with estrogen. GAHT for
female to male TG subjects (transmen) is based on testosterone CSHT without a GnRHa. CSHT is often started
at 12-16 years of age, before the pubertal surge in bone mass and the completion of skeletal maturation. In
addition, male and female adolescents with gender dysphoria are sometime treated temporarily with a GnRHa
without CSHT to suppress puberty. The effects of puberty blockade followed by CSHT and those of CSHT
without prior puberty blockade on skeletal maturation are mostly unknown. The gut microbiome is pivotal
regulator of skeleton postnatal maturation, bone health, and bone responsiveness to GnRHa and sex steroids.
Moreover, the composition of the microbiome is regulated by sex steroids. Thus, modifications to the gut
microbiome composition may mediate the effects of GnRHa and CSHT on the skeleton. Supporting this
hypothesis, our preliminary metagenomic analysis revealed that CSHT induced differences in the composition
of the gut microbiome. Preliminary studies also showed that CSHT impacts gut permeability, which can lead to
further changes in the gut microbiome composition. We further show that CSHT-induced modifications to the
composition of the gut microbiome alters indices of bone volume and structure, and the frequency of intestinal
and bone marrow (BM) T regulatory cells (Tregs), which is a T cell lineage expanded by estrogen and
testosterone. Tregs are essential in the regulation of bone formation and bone resorption. Based on our
preliminary data and on published reports, we hypothesize that GnRHa treatment and CSHT affect skeletal
maturation, and that these effects are mediated, in part, by modifications in gut microbiome composition and
changes in gut permeability. Aim 1a will investigate the extent to which microbiome depletion by antibiotic
treatment alters the skeletal effects of the GnRHa Leuprolide with and without subsequent CSHT in young male
and female mice. Aim 1b will utilize fecal material transfers (FMTs) to directly determine the extent to which stool
microbiome contributes to the skeletal effects of GnRHa treatment with and without subsequent CSHT in young
male and female mice. Aim 2a will determine the contribution of microbiome dependent expansion and migration
of gut Tregs to the skeletal effects of GnRHa treatment with and without subsequent CSHT. Aim 2b will
determine the contribution of increased gut permeability to the skeletal effects of GnRHa treatment with and
without subsequent CSHT, and Aim 2c will investigate if colonization of GF mice with bacteria mediating the

This project will determine the effects of GnRHa treatment with and without ensuing CSHT on skeletal

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cell therapy is a breakthrough immunotherapy for lymphoma.
Nevertheless, 40-60% of responding patients relapse, in part due to the poor persistence of CAR-T cells. In
this regard, our preliminary studies have identified the role of an inhibitory receptor that functions to restrict the
expansion and persistence of T cells. This proposal will test the hypothesis that similar to natural T cells, CAR-
T cells were also controlled by this inhibitory axis: in Aim 1, we will examine the causal role of this receptor axis
in impairing the therapeutic efficacy of murine CAR-T cells. In Aim 2, we will examine the expression of this
inhibitory receptor in human CAR-T cells and test effects of blocking this receptor in augmenting CAR-T
function. Together, these studies will guide future studies to develop potent therapeutics for improving the
clinical efficacies of CAR-T therapies."

Pediatric liver transplantation is a life-saving procedure for children with end-stage liver disease, yet long-term
outcomes remain sub-optimal. Children facing social adversity, and those from socioeconomically deprived
backgrounds have increased risk of graft failure and death following transplant. Disparities in post-transplant
outcomes are well-known, yet the field has thus far been unable to overcome them. In contrast, pediatric
primary care is rapidly evolving to develop assessment of specific social risk factors and integrate efficacious
interventions to address material economic hardships (e.g., food insecurity), poor health literacy, caregiver
mental health, social isolation, and neighborhood environment. One potential strategy, utilized in other fields, is
to incorporate Health Advocates (team members who help patients/families address social risks) into the
clinical team. To adapt a Health Advocate intervention to the needs of children undergoing liver transplantation,
a more nuanced understanding of which children are at highest risk, and how a health advocate could integrate
within the transplant team are needed. To that end, this study will leverage Dr. Wadhwani’s ongoing KL2
funded, multi-center prospective cohort (SOCIAL-Tx) across 8 U.S. transplant centers to achieve the following
Aims: (1) Characterize the association between social risks at the time of transplant with adverse outcomes at
1 and 3 years after transplant; (2) Use multi-stakeholder qualitative interviews (patients/families, physicians,
nurses, social workers) to characterize barriers and facilitators to optimal transplant care for patients/families
with social risks; (3) Assess feasibility of integrating a health advocate into a liver transplant team and pilot a
single-center study exploring whether targeted social support improves post-transplant outcomes. These Aims
will provide the necessary preliminary data for a future clustered, pragmatic multi-center RCT testing this
Health Advocate intervention. Dr. Wadhwani is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the University of
California, San Francisco. Building upon a strong foundation of research support, this K23 award will establish
him as an independent health services researcher pioneering research at the intersection of pediatric
hepatology, transplantation, and social determinants of health. Under the direct supervision of a
multidisciplinary team of leaders in liver transplant/multi-center cohort building (Jennifer Lai), pediatric
hepatology, and multi-center clinical trial design (John Bucuvalas), social care integration into health systems
(Laura Gottlieb), and qualitative and implementation science methods (Courtney Lyles), Dr. Wadhwani will
execute a detailed career development plan to achieve 4 training goals: (1) Pioneer a research niche
integrating social and medical care for children undergoing liver transplantation, (2) Develop expertise in social
adversity measurement and assessment, (3) Acquire skills necessary to develop, test, and implement health
system interventions (e.g., multi-center prospective mixed-methodology, survey methods, in-depth
interviewing, and ethnography), and (4) Develop skills in multi-center study design."

This is an administrative supplement to the parent study that examines changes in cannabis, alcohol, and
tobacco use and related health risk behaviors (e.g., driving while—or riding with a driver—under the influence
of cannabis, alcohol, and simultaneous effects of cannabis and alcohol) during the course of COVID-19
pandemic among young adults in Washington State. The parent study uses data from the Washington Young
Adult Health Survey (YAHS) that we collected with funding from the Washington State’s Division of Behavioral
Health and Recovery. YAHS is an accelerated longitudinal cohort sequential study of young adults ages 18–
25, with cohorts added annually and followed over time. The parent study uses data collected between 2015
and 2021, including two cohorts that were added after the onset of the pandemic, and five cohorts that had
longitudinal data spanning the time from before to during the pandemic. The work under this supplement will
involve the newest data available, collected from this sample in the summer and fall of 2022 (n=7,500). The
2022 data collection period came after mask mandates were lifted and many saw the pandemic as over. This
will allow us to examine the longer-term changes in substance use, related health risk behaviors, and
substance-specific risk and protective factors. The added wave of data will also be beneficial methodologically
by increasing the sample size and the associated statistical power to detect even smaller but clinically
meaningful effects. Moreover, in 2022, additional items assessing mental health were included, which will allow
us to assess the psychometric properties of the original assessment as well as the continuity of mental health
issues, both as consequences and predictors of substance use and related health risk behaviors. We will
assess the extent to which patterns (e.g., mode of use, sources, frequency, and amount) of cannabis, alcohol,
and tobacco use, simultaneous cannabis and alcohol use, and SU-related risk behaviors (e.g., driving while
intoxicated) differ in 2022 compared to earlier years (2015-2021). The role of community-level factors and
differences by socio-demographic characteristics (e.g., sex, sexual and gender minoritized status,
race/ethnicity, college student status) in these changes will be examined. Because the parent study aims to
assess within-person changes in substance use and related risk behaviors (e.g., driving while intoxicated),
focusing specifically on initiation, escalation, and desistance, having an additional wave of data will allow us to
understand what changes in outcomes were sustained and what changes were limited to the early years of the
pandemic, thereby bolstering the original aims of the parent study and improving the precision of planning of
prevention and intervention efforts aimed at improving health and reducing problem behaviors over the course
of young adulthood."
10948275,"Hypertension is a leading cardiovascular disease risk factor in the US and a leading cause of stroke, kidney
disease, and heart failure. Compared to White individuals, it is more prevalent, severe, and uncontrolled in
Black individuals, who have almost two-fold higher age-adjusted mortality for hypertension-related
cardiovascular deaths. Clinician implicit bias (IB) contributes to health disparities, including hypertension
disparities. Because hypertension is most often treated by primary care clinicians, this group is a high priority
for intervention to mitigate IB. Therefore, in order to achieve cardiovascular health equity, it is crucial to
mitigate the impact of primary care clinician IB in hypertension care.
We have developed and pilot-tested an evidence-based curriculum (“Reaching Equity”) designed to teach
practicing clinicians IB mitigation skills. Preliminary data in a group of non-primary care clinicians indicated that
clinicians are motivated to address IB in health care, that Reaching Equity is feasible and acceptable, and that
clinician confidence in providing equitable care increased.
In order to proceed to a definitive clinical trial to test the hypothesis that Reaching Equity will increase use of IB
mitigation skills by primary care clinicians and reduce racial disparities in hypertension outcomes, further work
is needed and will be accomplished in the proposed project. We will refine and standardize the Reaching
Equity curriculum, and additionally develop and standardize protocols for a) clinician enrollment and
engagement; b) patient enrollment and engagement; c) implementation of patient-initiated audio-recording of
clinical encounters; d) analysis of recorded encounters; e) extraction of blood pressure and other data from the
EHR; and f) data management and analysis. We will pilot these protocols in two primary care clinics, enrolling
20 primary care clinicians and 100 patients. Outcomes will include an objective measure of IB mitigation skills
immediately after completing intervention and EHR-generated assessment of hypertension control 3 and 6
months after intervention. In addition, we will obtain qualitative feedback from clinicians on study procedures,
curriculum content/format, and ways to sustain learning.
The proposed work is necessary and sufficient for the conduct of a subsequent full-scale randomized trial to
test the hypothesis that Reaching Equity will increase use of implicit bias mitigation skills by clinicians and
reduce racial disparities in hypertension outcomes."
10948391,"ABSTRACT
 Enterococcus faecium is a normal member of the healthy human microbiota; however, it has become a
concerning opportunistic pathogen. E. faecium is resistant to many first-line antibiotics and most clinical isolates
are also vancomycin-resistant (VREfm), leaving high-risk patients with few treatment options. As such, infections
caused by VREfm are challenging to manage, and ~10% of patients with VREfm bloodstream infections will go
on to develop recurrent disease. It is largely unknown how VREfm adapts within its host to evade eradication by
standard antimicrobial therapies and cause recurrent infections, as few systematic genomic or phenotypic
assessments have been performed in VREfm. The first two aims of this proposal plan to address this important
knowledge gap by 1) comparative genomic analyses of VREfm bloodstream isolates collected from patients with
recurrent infections to find genetic signatures associated with the potential to resist eradication and cause
recurrence; and 2) determining the role of antibiotic tolerance in recurrent VREfm disease.
 Bacteriophage (phage) therapy has the potential to provide clinicians with an additional tool for treating
challenging enterococcal infections, but transitioning phage therapy into clinical practice has been stymied by
the limited generalizability of small pre-clinical studies and the lack of pharmacokinetic-guided dosing regimens.
To address these limitations this proposal will 1) combine a broad-spectrum phage cocktail with VRE-targeting
antibiotics against the cohort of recurrent VREfm isolates proposed above to assess for phage-antibiotic
synergism and 2) develop a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model to determine optimal dosing strategies to
inform future clinical use. This collection of VREfm isolates will provide a representative cross-section of strains
likely to fail standard antibiotic therapies, and enable a thorough assessment of phage-antibiotic combinations
as potential treatment options for complex VREfm infections.
 This K08 proposal is a five-year career development program for Madison Stellfox, MD, PhD that provides
dedicated research training under the guidance of an expert mentoring team to enhance her existing laboratory
and clinical background and provide additional instruction in the principles of comparative genomics, evolutionary
biology, pharmacology, and phage therapy. Dr. Stellfox is currently an infectious diseases fellow and postdoctoral
researcher in the laboratory of Dr. Van Tyne, and the resources and mentorship available at the University of
Pittsburgh and in the Van Tyne laboratory provide an ideal educational environment. Through the successful
execution of this training plan, Dr. Stellfox will gain the experience and guidance she needs to achieve her
aspirations of becoming an independent physician-scientist with a research program focused on the in-host
evolution of gram-positive bacteria during recurrent disease and the practical application of phage therapy for
difficult-to-treat enterococcal infections."

Artificial light at night (ALAN) is an emerging environmental. Growing research has linked higher ALAN
exposures to a broad range of diseases, including cardiometabolic conditions. To date, the vast majority of
epidemiological studies on health effects of ALAN relied on satellite data to measure ALAN. Although satellite
data are publicly available and provide estimates across wide geographic areas and large populations, it remains
unknown to what degree satellite-based measures reflect individual-level exposures. To the best of our
knowledge, only two published studies compared satellite-based with individual-level ALAN measures and
reported weak or no correlation between the two. However, these studies have several limitations: First,
previous studies had small sample sizes with low ALAN levels, which limited statistical power and generalizability.
Second, previous studies lacked diversities required for in-depth analysis in subpopulations with different
geographic, demographic, socioeconomic and lifestyle characteristics, all of which may influence how well
satellite data capture individual-level exposures. Third, none of the previous studies investigated the validity of
satellite data in the context of studying exposure-outcome associations in epidemiological research. We propose
to conduct a comprehensive validation study of satellite-based ALAN measure in a large, diverse and nationally
representative sample, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2011-2014). The
NHANES collected individual-level ALAN measures using wrist monitors and residential addresses that can be
linked to satellite data, as well as information on a wide range of health outcomes, including cardiometabolic
markers that have been consistently linked to ALAN. Aim 1. Compare satellite-based ALAN measures with
individual-level measures in the overall sample. Aim 2 Compare satellite-based ALAN measures with individual-
level measures in subgroups with different sociodemographic, lifestyle and geographic characteristics. Aim 3
Compare the associations between cardiometabolic outcomes and ALAN using satellite-based or individual-level
measures. In the past years, we have worked diligently to obtain approval from the National Center for Health
Statistics to access the restricted address data, acquired and linked satellite data to NHANES, and determined
the relevant individual-level ALAN measures for comparison with satellite measures. With focused aims to
address gaps in existing research, our study will be the first large-scale validation study of satellite-based
ALAN measures in a nationally representative and diverse dataset with relevant health outcomes. It is
innovative because it will not only provide an overall measure of validity but will also examine whether and how
satellite data validity is influenced by population characteristics, and answer the critical question regarding the
utility of satellite data in assessing ALAN-health associations in epidemiological research. Thus, our study is
significant because it will provide key information for better interpreting existing epidemiological evidence,
guiding the design of future studies, and enhancing the translational value of ALAN research."

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global public health problem. Globally, 10 million people develop active TB each
year, but one-third of them are not diagnosed or started on treatment. Systematic screening of high-risk
populations, known as “active case finding,” can facilitate early diagnosis and reduce the global TB burden.
While chest X-ray (CXR) is a sensitive tool for TB screening, high-burden countries often do not have enough
qualified readers needed to scale up CXR-based screening. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer a
promising alternative through computer-aided detection (CAD). CAD systems analyze a CXR for signs of TB
and generate a numeric score that can be used to select people for further testing. Recently endorsed by the
WHO for TB screening, commercial CAD systems have begun their deployment for active case finding.
However, for CAD to realize its full potential and have a meaningful impact on TB epidemiology, it is essential
to tailor its implementation to the local population and screening context.
This proposal aims to optimize the implementation of digital X-ray technology with CAD for community-based
TB screening in sub-Saharan Africa. This will be accomplished by evaluating two novel screening strategies
against the current standard approach, which is to offer sputum testing to individuals with an X-ray abnormality
score above a set threshold. The first strategy is to individually adjust this threshold according to client
characteristics such as age, sex, HIV status, and symptoms (Aim 1). The second strategy is to develop and
utilize an independent CAD model, trained on chest radiographs from the local screening population, as
opposed to relying on a commercial CAD product trained on a larger, but less representative dataset (Aim 2).
In addition to evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of these approaches, the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of
each strategy will be evaluated against the conventional method within the Ugandan context (Aim 3).
This mentored patient-oriented research will not only inform future implementation of CAD for TB screening but
also provide a robust training platform for the award recipient. Through both research and career development
training, the recipient will acquire essential skills in advanced statistics, AI analytics, implementation science,
and health economics, as well as hands-on experience in field data collection.
This will lay the foundation for
an independent career as a clinical investigator focused on the implementation of AI-driven health innovations
in resource-limited settings."
10949395,"Project Summary. Depression and anxiety are 2-4 times as likely prevalent among cardiovascular disease
(CVD) or diabetes mellitus (DM) patients than among those without CVD or DM. Co-morbid depression and
anxiety have a detrimental impact on CVD or DM patients, including exacerbating chronic symptoms and
increasing mortality. However, co-morbid depression and anxiety are often underdiagnosed due to the multi-
layer barriers at the patient, clinician, and health system levels. Particularly, symptomatic issues and care
needs for depression and anxiety might not be easily shared during cardiology or endocrinology visits while
clinicians focus on chronic physiological symptoms. The patient portal allows patients to communicate with
providers to share their symptoms and concerns, which may signal the early signs of depression and anxiety.
Recently introduced Large Language Model (LLM) algorithms have created a robust environment for extracting
meaningful topics from large text data. Moreover, machine learning (ML)-based risk models have been
designed to predict the risk of CVD or DM, yet, modeling to predict the risk of co-morbid depression and
anxiety has been remarkably rare. Thus, in Aim 1, Dr. Kim will identify symptomatic issues and care needs for
depression and anxiety among CVD or DM patients using patient portal messages. More than 46 million
messages from Stanford Health Center (SHC) will be analyzed by LLM algorithms. It will transform the raw text
data into groups of words, then weight them to generate salient topics which represent the primary symptoms
and care needs. The generative AI algorithm will enhance interpretability of the topics. In Aim 2, Dr. Kim will
develop co-morbid depression and anxiety risk prediction models and specify risk factors among CVD or DM
patients. She will leverage the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator algorithm, using the electronic
health records of more than half a million patients at SHC to calculate the area under the curve to present the
accuracy of prediction and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals to indicate the strength of risk factors.
The long-term goal is to apply this patient portal-based symptom detection and risk prediction approach to
other at-risk populations to prepare tailored interventions to ultimately improve depression and anxiety
outcomes, aligning with the mission of NIMH, ""to transform the understanding and treatment of mental
illnesses, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure."" The Career Development Plan will enable Dr.
Kim to gain hands-on skillsets to use the newest LLM packages and construct LASSO-based prediction
models independently, with an advanced understanding of the clinical context of mental disorders under the
guidance of mentors (Dr. Linos in Digital Health, Dr. Rodriguez in Psychiatry, Dr. Hernandez-Boussard in
Medical Informatics) and advisors in Biostatistics, Cardiology, Endocrinology, Bioethics. All in all, the strong
mentor team and solid training plans along with an excellent institutional support, will fully prepare Dr. Kim to
be a well-disciplined independent investigator in computational epidemiology and mental health."
10953977,"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation, vascular injury, and
fibrosis. One in three patients with SSc dies within 10 years of diagnosis, making it one of the most deadly
autoimmune diseases. It affects women 5-10 times more frequently than men, yet relatively little is known about
the role that sex hormones, particularly estrogen, play in disease development and/or progression. Recent work
implicates macrophages (MØs) in the pathogenesis of SSc, as we have shown that MØs induce SSc fibroblast
activation, resulting in upregulation of pathways that regulate extracellular matrix synthesis and inflammation.
While the sex bias in SSc is clear and estrogen is a known modulator of MØ immune function, a potential
role for estrogen in the regulation of pro-fibrotic MØ activation in SSc has not been addressed. This is a
fundamental gap in our knowledge of disease pathogenesis that has significant clinical implications for the
treatment of SSc and potentially other sex-biased autoimmune diseases. Based on preliminary findings, we
hypothesize that estrogen induces pro-fibrotic MØ activation, enhancing inflammation and exacerbating fibrosis.
Results of this work may be used to inform the utilization of estrogen pathway-targeting therapeutics in SSc
patients, for whom current treatment options are significantly limited. The aims that will be tested in this
application are:
1. Determine how estrogen regulates SSc MØ activation and subset heterogeneity. SSc MØs express estrogen
receptors (ER) and estrogen mediates effects on MØ immune function, although the effect of estrogen on SSc
MØ activation is unknown. Studies in this aim will address how 17β estradiol and estrone alter SSc MØ pathway
activation and subset heterogeneity using CITE-seq. In addition, we will specifically interrogate the contribution
of estrogen (and estrogen inhibition) to STAT3 activation, which have shown is basally induced in SSc MØs.
2. Determine how estrogen-mediated changes in MØ activation promote inflammation and fibrosis in SSc. Co-
culture studies demonstrate that SSc MØs induce activation of SSc fibroblasts, implicating a role for MØs in the
induction and maintenance of fibrosis and inflammation. This aim will determine how estrogen-directed changes
in SSc MØ activation impact fibroblast activation using a novel 3D fabricated skin model of SSc."

 The overall goal of this supplement research is to probe the specific effects of obesity-driven altered
extracellular matrix (ECM) topography in breast tumor innervation. Obesity is marked by metabolic dysregulation
and a well-known comorbidity in female breast cancer. Interestingly, obese mammary adipose tissue contains
significantly thicker and aligned collagen I fibers. The altered ECM topography might be crucial in driving breast
tumor innervation, as neurites are known to prefer extending along aligned ECM fiber organization. A link
between 1) aligned collagen and innervation, 2) innervation and tumor malignancy, 3) obesity and aligned
collagen, and 4) obesity and metabolism dysregulation are well-established. However, how these factors
concertedly drive breast tumor innervation remains unclear. We hypothesize that aligned collagen I fibers present
in the obese breast tumor microenvironment (TME) potentiate breast tumor innervation.
 To test our hypothesis, we will use our in-house optimized composite hydrogels comprising decellularized
white adipose tissue and collagen type I combined with a custom-designed uniaxial stretching device to align
collagen I fibers. Using this platform, we will determine 1) metabolic profiles of the embedded co-cultures of
adipose stromal cells and normal or malignant human mammary epithelial cells, 2) neurotrophic factor secretion
from the co-cultures, and 3) neurite infiltration as an in vitro model of breast tumor innervation. Given our
expertise in tissue-engineered models of the breast TME, we are confident that we can determine the specific
effects of aligned collagen fibers on breast tumor innervation by means of dysregulated cellular metabolism in
breast cancer. This administrative supplement award will enable us to establish this line of research by
investigating obesity's effects on breast tumor innervation. In the future, we can better recapitulate obese TME,
e.g., by incorporating adipocytes in the 3D cultures and procuring cells from lean and obese animals and/or
patients. Notably, this research aligns with the National Cancer Institute’s interest in “fundamental mechanisms
of cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis”, and the Office of Research on Women's Health’s interest in
“research that addresses women’s health issues across the lifespan with an emphasis on chronic diseases and
comorbidities including obesity.”"

 Degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and resulting
pathophysiology in basal ganglia circuits are central to the core motor impairments in Parkinson's Disease
(PD). A variety of non-motor symptoms also are highly prevalent in PD, including motivation-related deficits
manifesting as apathy, fatigue, and depression, which have significant negative impacts on quality of life for
patients and caregivers. However, we still have limited understanding of how nigrostriatal dopamine
contributes to specific aspects of motivated behavior spanning action selection and invigoration, particularly in
the context of cost-benefit decisions entailing effortful reward seeking. Recent work has increasingly
highlighted a remarkable diversity of midbrain dopamine neurons, and indeed some subpopulations of SNc
dopamine neurons are preferentially vulnerable in PD. Defining the circuits regulating distinct nigrostriatal
dopamine projections and determining their subtype-specific roles in motivated behavior will address critical
knowledge gaps and represents important first steps toward developing more effective and specific treatments
for disorders such as PD. Our preliminary data suggest that manipulating afferent inputs can drive highly
divergent responses in different nigrostriatal dopamine projections. In particular, stimulating subthalamic
nucleus glutamatergic neurons drives diametrically opposed responses in nigrostriatal dopamine projections to
distinct striatal subregions. Additionally, stimulating different populations of descending striatonigral projections
evokes opposing patterns of dopamine release within the same region of the striatum. However, the circuit
interactions underlying these divergent effects remain unknown. Beyond its recognized role as a major basal
ganglia output nucleus, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) provides critical inhibitory regulation of SNc
dopamine neurons, and we propose that this may differ between dopamine neuron subtypes and mediate their
divergent responses to other basal ganglia afferent inputs. Given the anatomically segregated projections of
SNc dopamine neuron subtypes to different striatal subregions, we will test the hypothesis that these dopamine
subpopulations differentially contribute to dissociable aspects of effortful reward-seeking behavior. The major
goals of this proposal are therefore 1) to characterize how SNr GABA neurons regulate divergent nigrostriatal
dopamine pathways and potentially mediate pathway-specific responses to distinct afferent inputs, and 2) to
determine the roles of these SNc dopamine neuron subpopulations in effort-based decisions and instrumental
action invigoration. Collectively this research program will yield important advances in understanding basal
ganglia circuit regulation of diverse dopamine neuron subtypes and their contributions to motivated behaviors
often impacted in PD."

Infection-induced B cell activation occurs in the context of complex innate immune responses, including
the elaboration of cytokines, and the remodeling of secondary lymph tissues draining sites of infection. Our
long-term objective is to determine how optimal protective humoral immunity to infections is induced and
maintained. Exploring infection-induced innate stimuli that modulate adaptive immunity, we showed that
infection-induced and TLR-agonist adjuvanted s.c. immunization provide required B cell intrinsic TLR
signaling via both adaptors (MyD88 and TRIF) for extrafollicular responses, as deletion of both adaptors
abrogated EF responses. While B cell intrinsic MyD88 stimulation drives B cell proliferation, TRIF signaling
does not, indicating distinct yet unknown mechanisms of TRIF-mediated support for EF formation. When
and where, during B cell activation, these innate signals regulate B cell fate is unknown. Recently we
identified an early induced, post proliferative, influenza specific B cell population with a unique phenotype
and transcript profile that might represent an activation intermediate of EF. The objectives for this project
are to test the hypothesis that early in influenza infection B cell intrinsic TRIF/TLR3 and MyD88-mediated
signals support EF differentiation via two distinct differentiation paths, each differently affecting
extrafollicular antibody quality, acting on antigen-stimulated, post-proliferative B cells. To achieve our
objectives, we will test in Specific Aim 1 the hypothesis that B cell intrinsic TLR3-signals support effective
plasmablast differentiation by enhancing B cell responsiveness to IL2, while MyD88 principally drives
proliferation followed by terminal differentiation, differentially affecting antibody quality. In Specific Aim 2
we will determine the extent to which the population of transcriptionally distinct, antigen-experienced,
mostly non-switched and post-proliferative B cells that appear in the draining LN at 5 dpi with influenza
virus, represent an intermediary, quiescent stage in B cell activation to EF, extrafollicular memory B cells
and/or GC development and determine the impact of TLR signaling on their development and fate.
Successful completion of the work would provide significant conceptual advances to understanding early
B cell activation and extrafollicular memory B and plasma cell response induction. It would also identify a
novel role for TLR3 in support of EF development and clarify the function of TLRs on B cell responses.
Collectively these advances would identify new, critical junctures in B cell activation, regulated by innate
immune signals for potential exploitation in vaccine design."

Type-2 diabetes (T2D) is rising at an alarming rate in most of low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). This
rapid increase in the T2D burden has a particular impact on cities, where more than half the LMIC populations
currently live and where 3 out of 4 people with T2D reside. In response to this growing global challenge, the
World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasized (a) the need for an equitable and sustained improvement in
the detection, treatment, and control of T2D, and (b) a rapid implementation of the WHO’s evidence-based
HEARTS-D module, which aims to improve service delivery for T2D in primary care facilities. However, currently,
in most LMICs (such as Bangladesh), effective adoption of the WHO HEARTS-D module into routine urban
primary care has been limited owing to substantial implementation barriers. These include suboptimal delivery
mechanisms, poor uptake, weak monitoring system, and inadequate capacities. To address this, we will evaluate
a community-to-facility integrated strategy to implement WHO HEARTS-D module in the existing urban service
delivery system in Bangladesh. First, we will develop and optimize a community-to-facility integrated strategy for
adopting the WHO HEARTS-D module using Implementation Mapping (IM). Guided by the IM approach, we will
conduct mixed methods assessments to: (a) identify contextual factors, and (b) assess the implementation
behavior of providers that may influence T2D care in cities. We will then develop and optimize a suitable
implementation strategy that can achieve high coverage, access and utilization of T2D care, specifically for urban
poor populations, through iterative cycles of mixed methods qualitative assessments, implementation, and
outcome measurements. For this aim, trained study staff will select ~45 key stakeholders, primary care providers
and CHWs as participants, based in 3 wards in Sylhet city of Bangladesh. Second, we will evaluate the impacts
of the optimized community-to-facility integrated strategy on implementation outcomes. We will conduct a 2-arm,
type 2, hybrid implementation-effectiveness randomized trial. The study will involve a total of 20 municipal wards
as clusters from Sylhet city (10 in each arm). This cluster randomized trial will compare the following strategies:
(a) a community-to-facility integrated strategy for implementing the WHO HEARTS-D module and (b) a facility-
only service delivery strategy (without a community component). We will evaluate the implementation process
by defining relevant outcomes based on the RE-AIM framework components: reach, effectiveness,
implementation, and maintenance. Third, we will compare the effectiveness of this integrated strategy on T2D
status. Based on a study sample of 5,000 randomly selected participants, we will aim to compare improvements
in the prevalence of controlled T2D status, treatment uptake and adherence to glucose-lowering therapy, T2D
complications and awareness among participants in both study arms, from baseline to end-line. Our should guide
the policymakers into effective implementation and sustainment of WHO HEARTS-D module that can be: (a)
embedded within local organizational structures, and (b) adapted to similar contexts globally."

 Uncertainty in our understanding of the functional impact of variation in the human genome has grossly
impeded our ability to realize the full potential of now mature sequencing technologies. There is a universal
need in genomics for the development of tools to support high-throughput functional characterization of
genomic variants in disease genes. This proposal will develop Multiplexed Assays of Variant Effects (MAVEs)
to functionally assess genomic variation of over 10,000 variants in a ligand and receptor pair, JAGGED1
(JAG1) and NOTCH2, that result in the autosomal dominant disorder, Alagille syndrome, a pediatric cause of
liver, cardiac, vertebral, renal, ocular, and facial anomalies. Functional haploinsufficiency is the mechanism for
JAG1-related disease and the likely mechanism for NOTCH2-related disease, which is supported by the high-
frequency of protein-truncating and large gene deletions seen for JAG1-related disease and a by a high
intolerance for loss-of-function variants observed in population databases for NOTCH2. Missense variants,
which are identified in 15% of patients with a JAG1 variant and >50% of patients with a NOTCH2 variant, are
notoriously difficult to classify, but those that are pathogenic show defects related to protein misfolding,
intracellular retention, and an inability to heterodimerize. Moreover, a high incidence of missense variants of
uncertain consequence in both genes identified during routine panel testing for general cholestatic disease
confuses both patients and providers. Resolution of the functional consequence of all missense variation in
JAG1 and NOTCH2 through the development of high-throughput tools would greatly improve diagnostics and
reduce reporting of non-disease-associated variants.
 We propose the development of MAVEs to simultaneously test the functional consequence of all disease-
relevant missense variants in JAG1 and a subset of those in NOTCH2. In Aim 1 we will design two separate
MAVEs to analyze membrane expression and NOTCH2-binding ability of all JAG1 nucleotide permutations as
readouts of protein function. In Aim 2 we will modify these MAVEs for use in studying all nucleotide
permutations across a region of interest in NOTCH2 that contains the JAG1-binding interface. In Aim 3 we will
test the fidelity of our assay system by studying variant effects in liver cell lines, including both a high-
throughput MAVEs approach and a low-throughput, but high-fidelity induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model
approach. Aims 1 and 2 will include complementary structural modeling and binding assays while Aim 3 will
interrogate the role of cellular environment using disease-relevant cell lines, all of which we expect will validate
and extend our findings, providing insight into the biochemical and cellular consequences of pathogenic
variation. Ultimately, these data will resolve uncertainty in JAG1 missense variant function that will benefit
diagnostics, improve our understanding of the functional consequence for NOTCH2 variants, and provide
guidance for how to incorporate this functional data as useable evidence during clinical variant interpretation."

Clinical predictors are now firmly incorporated into routine standard-of-care in many fields of medicine, in contrast
with Psychiatry where quantitative predictors that guide clinical decision-making remain extremely
limited. Psychosis-related disorders are responsible for a substantial public health burden, for which there are
significant unmet needs that would be subserved by clinical predictors. For example, long-term outcomes vary
widely and identifying individuals with poor or advantageous future outcomes would help to optimize treatment
planning and resource allocation. Furthermore, antipsychotics are associated with adverse side effects, such as
increased risk of diabetes. In this application, we propose to use machine learning approaches to build predictors
and identify subtypes of clinical outcomes among individuals with schizophrenia, through integration of
longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), dimensional phenotyping, and genetic analyses. We will also
explore the psychosocial and ethical implications of psychiatric clinical predictors. Our long-term objective is to
advance the goals of Precision Psychiatry to achieve individualized treatment planning, outcome monitoring, and
preventive interventions. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Leverage two independent EHR
databases for outcome prediction and sub-classification of psychosis-related disorders. (a) We will use
the longitudinal PSYCKES and MarketScan databases to build machine learning-based individual-level
prediction models to forecast the onset of four major prognostic outcomes: treatment response (antipsychotic
resistance), illness severity (long-term hospitalization), medical comorbidity (diabetes), and diagnostic transition
from a psychosis-related disorder to schizophrenia. (b) We will perform cohort-level analyses using unsupervised
methods to discover novel psychosis-related diagnosis and prognosis subtypes. Aim 2: Enhance predictive
modeling through dimensional phenotyping and whole genome sequencing. (a) We will recruit n = 10,000
patients with schizophrenia from the PSYCKES database population for enriched data collection: 1) dimensional
phenotyping (cognition, exposome, and social determinants of health), and 2) whole genome sequencing to
enable calling of rare variants, structural variants, and common variants (polygenic risk). (b) We will investigate
the extent to which dimensional phenotypes and genomic data can improve the models developed in Aim 1. Aim
3: Explore the psychosocial and ethical implications of psychiatric clinical predictors. (a) We will survey
a subset of patients and their clinicians regarding their attitudes towards implementation of clinical outcome
predictors. (b) We will return pathogenic findings to patients through genetic counseling and survey the
experience of patients and their clinicians on their emotional reactions and perceptions of impairment, treatability,
and life-planning."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Objective and Specific Aims: This project seeks to comprehensively understand how gene regulatory elements
within rapidly evolving areas of the human genome, segmental duplications, influence human evolution and
disease. Despite their potential significance, these regions have historically been challenging to study due to
technical limitations. The specific aims of this project are:
 1. Characterize segmental duplications across the human population by constructing a pangenome graph
 using thousands of high-quality genome assemblies.
 2. Establish a statistical and computational methodology for mapping regulatory DNA within SDs using long-
 read chromatin fiber sequencing (Fiber-seq).
 3. Identify conserved regulatory and genomic elements within segmental duplication loci by mapping
 genetic and epigenetic haplotypes into the pangenome graph.
 4. Uncover the regulatory fate of multi-copy gene families by analyzing segmental duplication paralogs with
 Fiber-seq across tissues, determining if these paralogs have undergone changes in regulatory function.
Relevance to the Agency's Mission: This research directly aligns with the institute’s mission to understand the
genetic underpinnings of human evolution and disease. SD regions, due to their rapid evolution and complexity,
have remained challenging to study. Yet, they hold invaluable insights into human-specific genetic adaptations
and susceptibilities to diseases. Identifying and characterizing regulatory elements in these fast-evolving
genomic regions will offer novel insights into human-specific traits, as well as potential vulnerabilities to diseases.
Research Design and Methods: In this work, I will create a comprehensive SD pangenome graph by integrating
thousands of long-read haplotypes from multiple consortia, which will significantly enhance our understanding of
human variation within SDs. Next, I will use long-read Fiber-seq in conjunction with the development of a
machine-learning framework to detect regulatory elements within SDs and use that information to impute the
results of other short-read epigenetic assays. My approach will also involve a conservation analysis that
prioritizes SD genes and regulatory elements. I will introduce a novel 'loss-of-paralog intolerance' (pLPI) score
to rank these genes based on their conservation levels across populations. Additionally, the regulatory
trajectories of SD genes will be determined using Fiber-seq conducted on a range of human tissues. This will
help me identify distinct patterns such as neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization, or pseudofunctionalization.
This investigative approach will deliver an in-depth understanding of the regulatory mechanisms in SDs using
cutting-edge genomic tools. The insights gained have the potential to highlight human-specific regulatory
adaptations and could pave the way for discovering new therapeutic avenues in personalized medicine.

Fabry disease is the most common lysosomal storage disorder, arising from mutations in the X-linked gene Gla
and subsequent accumulation of intracellular globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and lyso-Gb3. Patients with Fabry
disease frequently develop a painful small fiber neuropathy, which is exacerbated following heat-induced pain
crises. Little is known, however, about the mechanisms contributing to pain in Fabry disease, and even less is
known about the mechanisms of pain exacerbation during pain crises in these patients. This is in part due to
the evidence that mouse Fabry models poorly recapitulate the pain in patients with Fabry disease. In rodent
models of painful neuropathy, sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion often exhibit spontaneous activity
and increased excitability. Our rat model of Fabry disease exhibits sensitization of mechanical pain behaviors,
spontaneous activity, and both mechanical- and current-evoked excitability of dorsal root ganglion neurons. We
have recently demonstrated a p11-dependent glial-neuron signaling axis in Fabry disease that results in
increased current-evoked excitability and voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channel current density. This suggests
NaV channels may contribute to sensory neuronal hyperexcitability and pain behaviors in Fabry disease;
however, it is not clear which NaV channels are hyper functional in Fabry disease, nor is it clear whether
neuronal-intrinsic mechanisms also contribute to their dysregulation. Moreover, it is unknown whether heat
contributes to increased neuronal excitability in Fabry disease. In the aims outlined in this proposal, I will use
voltage-clamp patch electrophysiology, mechanical- and current-evoked patch electrophysiology, and a battery
of reflexive and non-reflexive behavioral measures of pain to identify molecular mechanisms contributing to
neuronal and behavioral sensitization in Fabry disease at steady state (Aim 1) and following heat-induced pain
crises (Aim 2). In Aim 1, I will identify which NaV channels exhibit altered biophysics in Fabry disease sensory
neurons at steady-state (Aim 1A) and determine whether these channels are similarly dysregulated by Gb3
and lyso-Gb3 (Aim 1B). In Aim 2, I will determine whether Fabry rats are sensitized to reflexive and non-
reflexive behavioral measures of pain following heat treatment (Aim 2A). Further studies will determine whether
heat-treatment potentiates mechanically evoked (Aim 2B) and current-evoked (Aim 2C) excitability in dorsal
root ganglia neurons from Fabry rats. These studies will ultimately identify which voltage-gated sodium
channels underpin increased neuronal excitability at steady state and whether further increased neuronal
excitability contributes to heat-evoked pain crises in Fabry disease. Overall, the proposed aims will definitively
determine mechanisms contributing to excitability and pain in Fabry disease, potentially revealing therapeutic
targets to reduce pain and improve quality of life in patients afflicted by Fabry disease."

Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability. Over the last 20 years, with the decline in stroke mortality due to
improvements in acute care, there has been an increase in the global stroke burden. Most stroke survivors
experience varying degrees of motor and neuropsychiatric disorders that significantly impair their quality of life.
Post stroke depression (PSD) is a common and serious consequence of stroke that affects many stroke
survivors. Women are twice as likely to develop depression after stroke compared to men. Affected individuals
are at an increased risk of mortality, recurrent stroke and have delayed functional recovery. Immune
dysregulation, microglial hyper-activation, enhanced inflammation, and decreased levels of neurogenesis have
been implicated in the pathophysiology of both depression and impaired stroke recovery. These alterations are
even more pronounced in aged individuals. This proposal will focus on elucidating the mechanisms underlying
the development of depression in aged mice after an ischemic stroke.
Oxytocin (OXT) is a neuropeptide that acts as both a hormone and neurotransmitter and is an important regulator
of social behavior, learning and memory, maintenance of cardiovascular health. Based on our preliminary
studies, and literature, taurine regulates the release of OXT and reduces neuro-inflammation. Taurine is a highly
abundant free amino acid in the brain, with multiple functions including a vital role as a neurotransmitter and is
capable of reversing stress-induced depressive-behaviors. Interestingly, both OXT and taurine effectively reduce
microglial activation, and this raises the intriguing possibility that both are involved in the development of PSD
through the modulation of microglia. In this context, we hypothesize that stroke leads to a loss of taurine and
OXT with subsequent increase in microglial activation and development of PSD. In our preliminary studies, we
have found that taurine and oxytocin levels decline with stroke in both mice and humans. We have also found
that chronic oxytocin inhibition leads to depressive-like behaviors in young animals even without brain injury, and
inhibition of oxytocin significantly impairs post-stroke recovery. By using wild-type and knockout mice, a variety
of pharmacological tools, cell-specific genetic models, and bone marrow chimeras, we will manipulate oxytocin
signaling (Aim 1); supplement taurine (Aim 2), and deplete microglia (Aim 3), to determine if these mechanisms
are involved in the development of PSD phenotypes in aged mice of both sexes. We will determine the potential
of taurine and oxytocin to improve recovery in aged mice after stroke. The results from this study have a high
potential for translation into clinical settings, as oxytocin and taurine are in clinical use for other indications."
10946295,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Almost 600,000 patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are on hemodialysis (HD) in the United States.
An arteriovenous (AV) access is the preferable access for HD. Dysfunction of AV access is common and
predominantly occurs due to stenosis in the AV access, which is typically managed by a cross-disciplinary
team of vascular surgeons, interventionists, and nephrologists. Based on Medicare data analysis, ~ 1.0-1.2
million AV access procedures are performed annually in the US. Although angiography is the standard
diagnostic modality for AV access dysfunction, angiography introduces errors in stenosis estimation and
cannot characterize the morphology of stenosis or measure the pressure across the stenosis. These
parameters are integrated in the decision to intervene in other stenotic vascular diseases and predict their
response to an intervention. The latter aspect is important as AV access restenosis occurs in 50% of
intervened AV accesses, and some stenoses may undergo accelerated restenosis. Therefore, a method for
accurately diagnosing AV access stenoses and predicting the response to an intervention is imminent. We
address the current limitations in AV access dysfunction diagnosis using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) at the
point of care in ESKD patients.
 IVUS provides a 3-D view of the stenosis, thereby enhancing the accuracy of estimating it. Lack of
contrast agent or bony interference and the ability to obtain morphological characterization and pressure
gradients are additional advantages. IVUS is used in the management of other stenotic vascular diseases,
where it has altered the management of > 50% of patients examined via conventional angiography. We
recently completed a pilot study evaluating the feasibility, safety and initial sensitivity of IVUS over angiography
in patients presenting with AV access dysfunction. IVUS detected 14 more stenoses, which were missed by
angiography. Angiography underestimated the severity of stenosis in 30% of lesions. Two morphological
features were extracted using a deep neural network. The current grant proposal examines the superiority of
IVUS over angiography. We will also examine the implications of IVUS-based stenosis, morphological indices
and hemodynamic parameters in the intervention of AV access stenosis using radiological response and target
lesion primary patency rate. An interdisciplinary team of vascular surgeons, interventional radiologists,
nephrologist and clinical research will complete this study, which has the potential to establish IVUS as a new
standard-of-care imaging modality for AV access stenosis."

In the United States, 8.2 million women and 2.0 million men age 50 and above have osteoporosis. Moreover,
half of all women and one quarter of men are projected to suffer an age-related low bone mass fracture within
these populations. Importantly, an estimated 25% of individuals die within one year of a hip fracture. Cortical
bone comprises the majority of skeletal bone mass (80%) and diminished cortical bone mass accounts for 70%
of all bone lost with age. Although bone anabolic agents enhance vertebral cortical bone mass, efficacy of these
agents is lower at the hip as compared to the spine (+12.3% spine, +3.9% hip); therefore, additional therapeutics
improving cortical bone mass are desperately needed. Recent evidence shows that EMP-derived osteoclasts
support balanced bone remodeling. In contrast, HSC-derived osteoclasts facilitate bone resorption in perturbed
states. These observations suggest that osteoclasts of alternate developmental origins impact bone remodeling
differentially, but we lack an understanding of how bone remodeling may differ within specific bone compartments
(e.g., cortical versus trabecular bone). The two-year deliverables of the proposed study are: 1) identification of
myeloid progenitors that aid in maintenance of cortical bone with age and 2) characterization of putative
cells/molecules that promote coupling within cortical bone. If successful, this work could spur the development
of new therapeutics that specifically limit age-associated cortical bone loss."
10947684,"Project Summary
The ability to collect high resolution volumetric datasets of whole organs is arguably most applicable to the neuroscience
field. Individual neurons on the micron scale comprise circuits that extend across large brain territories over millimeters
apart; thus, perturbations of neuronal circuits in models of neurological, psychiatric or brain injury conditions can become
evident only by assessing volumetric datasets spanning the micro-, meso- and macro-scales. We are requesting funds to
purchase a TissueVision TissueCyte 1600FC serial two-photon tomography (STPT) microscope to enable high-throughput,
high resolution automated imaging of whole, uncleared rodent brains or spinal cord segments by NIMH/NIH supported
investigators at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, TX. STPT is a block face volumetric imaging modality in which
two-photon mosaic tile imaging is alternated repeatedly with vibrotome sectioning to obtain full 3D volumes of the entire
brain or spinal cord segment.
The instrument will be housed in and maintained by the Whole Brain Microscopy Facility (WBMF) and will be available to
all investigators on campus as well as external users. This instrument will complement and expand the capacity of two
existing STPT systems within the facility (TissueVision TissueCyte 1000 - both 9 years old) which are heavily used (1100
total samples imaged since 2014; projected total of 168 samples for CY23) and lack many features of the updated
TissueCyte 1600FC. Our existing TC1000 systems have a single tunable Ti:Sapphire excitation laser and are configured for
detection of three emission channels (blue, green and red), which greatly limits their range of detectable fluorophores
and multiplexing capability. The new TC1600FC system offers a dual laser line system, four detection channels and the
innovative robotic “SlicePlacer” module to automatically mount the sections onto slides after imaging for correlative
staining. Our existing TC1000s cannot accommodate imaging of far-red fluorophores, multiplex imaging of fluorophores
with widely separated excitation spectra, ratiometric imaging of inherent autofluorescent signals, label free nonlinear
microscopy methods such as second and third harmonic generation (SHG and THG), or automatic mounting of sections.
The WBMF has a full time computational scientist on staff and robust, custom developed registration and analysis
pipelines to accommodate quantification of STPT whole brain and cord datasets. There are no other STPT microscopes
available on the UT Southwestern campus or in the state of Texas to our knowledge.
The WBMF has a broad user base, currently serving 237 active clients from 98 individual laboratories across 31 basic
science and clinical departments with a wide variety of project foci. Since the installation of the current TissueCyte 1000
instruments in 2014, we have supported STPT experiments from 41 individual investigators, the vast majority of which are
neuroscience focused. We have 22 active clients using these systems currently, including the 8 major users described in
this application. Research projects that will benefit from the use of the proposed equipment are focused on multiple
devastating neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions, including autism, schizophrenia, depression, epilepsy, dementia
and spinal cord injury."

Loss of muscle mass, as seen in cancer cachexia, and sarcopenia correlates with heightened
mortality rates, making it a global health concern with the aging population. We desperately need
advanced molecular understanding to develop effective therapies. The intricate regulation of
muscle mass involves several signaling pathways, orchestrating gene expression changes via
activation and repression of transcription factors activity. Recent findings from our lab have
uncovered the role for the transcription factor Maf in the maturation of fast twitch myofibers by
directly activating fast muscle gene expression. Fast twitch myofibers are more affected than slow
twitch myofibers in numerous atrophic conditions. Interestingly, Maf expression and activity are
repressed during muscle atrophy. Our preliminary data indicate that Maf overexpression can
suppress muscle atrophy. We hypothesize that Maf functions as a transcriptional repressor of the
atrophic gene program, offering a promising therapeutic avenue. This proposal outlines a
comprehensive plan to dissect the functions of Maf during muscle atrophy. To accomplish this, I
will employ the following specific Aims: 1. To examine the transcriptional role of Maf in skeletal
muscle atrophy. 2. To identify the partners and regulators of Maf activity in skeletal muscle.
3. To investigate the protective role of Maf in cachexia and sarcopenia. The K99 portion of
this proposal will be carried out in the lab of the renowned molecular biologist, Dr. Eric Olson.
In order to gain research independence through mentored training, I will continue to develop
expertise in applying transcriptome profiling, including single nuclei RNAseq, to study how Maf
transcriptionally reprograms myofibers (Aims 1). The proposed research also requires that I
acquire additional mentoring to evaluate the partners of Maf using proteomic mass spectrometry,
and the AAV gene therapy detailed in Aim 2 and 3. The knowledge and skills that I acquire during
this time will serve as critical components of the foundation of my own independent lab. In
summary, the structured approach detailed in this Pathway to Independence Award application
not only promises to advance my growth as an independent researcher but also intends to make
significant contributions to neuromuscular research. The anticipated outcomes from the proposed
aims have the potential to reshape the understanding of muscle atrophy and lay the groundwork
for my scientific journey."
10948634,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Sequence-specific DNA binding by transcription factors (TFs) regulates RNA synthesis at target genes.
This is a highly dynamic and context-dependent process, allowing cells to accurately regulate gene expression
in response to diverse signals. While prior work has identified DNA binding preferences for numerous TFs, our
understanding of the fundamental principles governing TF-DNA binding specificity and affinity remains
incomplete. This is primarily due to limitations of current high-throughput methods, which fail to reliably detect
low- to medium-affinity TF-DNA interactions that are more common and important for genomic binding in vivo.
To address this gap, I have developed PADIT-seq, an innovative high-throughput reporter assay that enables
functional testing and quantification of TF binding affinity across thousands of DNA sequences in a single
experiment. The overall goal of this proposal is to utilize and further develop PADIT-seq to uncover fundamental
TF-DNA binding principles, which will significantly advance our mechanistic understanding of the regulatory
genome. Aim 1 will determine the role of medium-low affinity auxiliary binding sites and DNA shape features in
determining TF genomic occupancy. I hypothesize that preferential recognition of sequential low-medium affinity
sites flanking a core motif cooperatively increases residence time beyond what is predicted by core motifs alone.
Aim 2 will apply PADIT-seq to identify the TFs whose binding is affected by pancreatic disease associated
noncoding variants. It will also further develop PADIT-seq to make the assay even higher-throughput, enabling
testing of higher numbers of TFs more easily. Finally, Aim 3 will elucidate intrinsic orientation biases of DNA
binding domains in positioning partner proteins on DNA. Successful execution of these aims will provide major
insights into the grammar and mechanisms underlying TF regulatory specificity. This work will also reveal how
alterations in gene regulation driven by noncoding variants contribute to complex human diseases.
 My PhD research focused on identifying disease-associated genetic variants that are functionally relevant
through genomic approaches. However, determining the precise TFs whose DNA binding is disrupted by these
variants remained challenging. To overcome this barrier, my postdoctoral research has centered on pioneering
a high-throughput PADIT-seq technology to sensitively profile how noncoding genetic variants alter TF-DNA
interactions. While developing PADIT-seq has been a crucial advance, I need further training to
complement this breakthrough with additional skills necessary to fully connect genotypes to cellular
phenotypes. This will enable me to provide a complete picture elucidating how noncoding variants dysregulate
transcriptional programs to promote disease. The K99/R00 award will provide invaluable training to equip me
with the scientific and professional expertise needed to elucidate how noncoding variants dysregulate gene
networks to promote human disease as an independent principal investigator."

The objective of the 106th Annual CASA Educational and Training Seminar is to provide a venue where
field inspectors, food program managers, industry leaders and academia from across the region can
personally interact and share ideas while receiving information on current and emerging food topics
impacting health and safety. The agenda includes presentations that will give local and state regulators
an opportunity to hear a national and international perspective on food safety and will include emerging
hot topics such as the use of AI to improve food safety, the FDA’s food traceability rule, shellfish
sanitation and regulating “pop-up” restaurants. The agenda included in the Conference Plan contains
the list of topics to be presented at the conference.
To our knowledge, this is one of the most comprehensive and cost effective in-person educational
opportunities to address a range of current food safety issues facing state and local regulatory
programs. CASA maintains the cost of the conference as low as possible in an effort to allow access to
the seminar to the widest range of participants. The low cost of the conference enables food safety
professionals from all levels of the regulatory community and industry to participate.
The training will be held at the Hilton Richmond Hotel in Richmond, VA from May 6, 2024 - May 9, 2024
and 125 participants are anticipated. The conference draws representatives of state, county, municipal
and federal regulatory agencies charged with public health and safety responsibilities, the regulated

Current therapy for patients with ischemic stroke is limited and new treatment is needed since
the mortality and morbidity of this population remain high. Effort aimed at blocking immune cell-
mediated inflammation with enhanced inflammation resolution represents a novel approach.
The specific background for the proposed project is that we have identified a lead drug
candidate through our collaboration with Dr. Kenneth A. Jacobson at NIH and have
demonstrated anti-stroke efficacy in an established murine ischemic stroke model and have
shown potency in blocking human P2X4R in myeloid cells of healthy subjects. The Company is
collaborating with its academic partner University of Connecticut School of Medicine’s research
laboratories, and Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry of the National Institute of Diabetes,
Digestive and Kidney Diseases of NIH. The Company, with its resources, has had STTR Phase
1 funding and should be well positioned to perform IND-enabling studies. The objective of the
grant is to conduct IND-enabling process chemistry, GLP manufacturing of the lead compound
and safety/toxicity studies. The proposed studies should add to scientific knowledge on the
chemistry and pharmacology of P2X4 antagonists and may also yield new insights into the
science of such an anti-inflammatory approach. Pending successful outcomes, the proposal
should position the Company to prepare an IND application to the FDA."

Amblyopia is the leading cause of vision loss in children. Delayed diagnosis and/or inadequate treatment of
amblyopia in early childhood may result in permanent vision loss. Children from historically marginalized
communities are at increased risk of preventable vision loss. However, the underlying social determinants of
health contributing to the racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in the visual outcomes of amblyopic
children are poorly understood. There is an urgent need to understand the factors contributing to diagnostic
delay and treatment failure in amblyopia – an effort that may offer novel opportunities for community-based
interventions and vision screening policies that promote health equity.
This proposal aims to investigate the delivery of preventive vision care in the US and develop tools to identify
children at risk of preventable vision loss. This research will leverage an array of large data sources – including
nationally representative surveys, insurance claims, and electronic health records – to identify modifiable factors
that may improve the visual outcomes of children with amblyopia from historically marginalized communities.
The central hypothesis is that household- and neighborhood-level social determinants of health influence the
receipt of vision screening (Aim 1), access to eye specialty care (Aim 2), and treatment success (Aim 3). The
investigations will evaluate existing vision screening policies in the US, identify geospatial barriers to health care
access, and help develop a prediction model to identify children at high risk for vision loss from amblyopia.
The candidate, Dr. Isdin Oke, is a pediatric ophthalmologist, data scientist, and health services researcher whose
long-term goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in data-driven approaches to reduce
preventable vision loss in children. The career development plan will provide expertise in study design, research
methods, and advanced biostatistical approaches for conducting health equity research. The mentorship team
includes expertise in health services research, vision screening, social epidemiology, geospatial analyses, and
predictive modeling. The training environment at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School
provides access to rich data sources and computational infrastructure. The unique combination of the training
plan, mentorship team, and institutional environment will accelerate the candidate's development into an NIH-
funded independent investigator and leader in data science and health disparities research in ophthalmology."

disease occurrence. The proposed K01 application will provide Dr. Ba protected time, which will be devoted
towards training and career development activities targeting the following objectives to strengthen Dr. Ba's
trajectory toward becoming a successful independent investigator: (1) Acquire knowledge and expand didactic
learning; (2) Gain advanced quantitative skills required for developing different dietary indices and analyzing
longitudinal dietary data from epidemiologic studies; (3) Enhance Dr. Ba translational grantsmanship and
leadership skills to effectively compete for future NIH funding; and (4) Obtain the knowledge base and
professional skills to perform Data Coordinating Center activities. Dr. Ba has assembled a mentoring team
comprised of a primary mentor, Vernon M. Chinchilli, PhD a leading expert in the field of biostatistics and Data
Coordinating Centers, and three co-mentors: Dr. Phil Hart (gastroenterologist), Dr. Qi Sun (nutritional
epidemiologist), and Dr. Nazia Raja-Khan (endocrinologist). Healthy plant-based and Mediterranean diets,
which are based on high consumption of antioxidant-rich foods such as fruits and vegetables, have been
associated with a lower risk of diabetes in the general population. In contrast, pro-inflammatory diets such as
those reflected by a high empirical insulinemic index and a high empirical dietary inflammatory index including
red and processed meats, may lead to an increased risk of diabetes. These dietary components are known to
be positively associated with endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress that
can cause tissue damage, especially reduced pancreatic β-cell function. Almost one-third of patients with acute
pancreatitis (AP) will develop diabetes within 3 years but it is unclear whether the risk is based on dietary
patterns. This constitutes a critical knowledge gap regarding the effects of different dietary patterns on the
prevention of diabetes following AP and whether such risk can be mitigated. The overall objective of this
application is to acquire detailed knowledge and novel research skills needed to accomplish the following
research aims: Aim 1: To prospectively determine the role of dietary patterns in the development of diabetes
(primary outcome) or pre-diabetes (secondary outcome) following an episode of AP; Aim 2: To determine the
associations of dietary patterns with weight changes, waist circumference, and biomarkers of metabolic
alterations related to diabetes; Aim 3: To determine whether weight changes and biomarkers of metabolic
alterations are mediators for the association between dietary patterns and the risk of new-onset diabetes
among AP participants in the DREAM study. Findings from this project will provide strong evidence about the
role of dietary patterns on the occurrence of future diabetes following AP."

Despite the high prevalence of substance use disorders (SUDs), including opioid use disorder (OUD), among
people incarcerated in the US, only a small portion receive SUD treatment while incarcerated. One barrier is
limited evidence-based treatment availability in correctional facilities. Concerning OUD, though a growing
number of facilities are screening for OUD and providing medication for OUD (MOUD), supporting these
services across correctional facilities has been limited; adjunctive behavioral counseling to support MOUD
adherence and outcomes is recommended in clinical practice guidelines, but availability may be limited in
correctional facilities. Furthermore, correctional mental health staff report high burnout, which affects the
quality of care delivered. Digital therapeutics for SUDs—which may offer an accessible, low-cost, and low-
burden option for providing treatment—would be helpful in closing the gap between incarcerated individuals
with OUD and other SUD(s) who need treatment and services available in correctional facilities.
 The proposed training plan and research project of this K23 application will provide mentored training to
support Dr. Jennifer Loya's pursuit of an independent research career conducting patient-oriented research
with dual expertise in substance use treatment and implementation science. The training goals focus on
gaining knowledge in implementation science methods, learning specific qualitative methods and respective
data analysis, and gaining experiencing in conducting a pilot clinical trial, as well as advancing career
development. Complementing these goals, Dr. Loya will receive mentorship from experts in these areas and
participate in structured didactic and experiential training through formal coursework and trainings/workshops,
attendance at seminars and annual conferences, and direct research activities.
 The research plan aims to gain a comprehensive understanding of how an evidence-based digital
therapeutic of cognitive and behavioral skills for substance use—Computer Based Training for Cognitive
Behavioral Therapy (CBT4CBT)—could be effectively implemented as a treatment for incarcerated people with
current OUD/SUD. In Aim 1, attitudes and perceptions of using a digital therapeutic for SUDs and input
regarding barriers to and facilitators for implementing CBT4CBT will be assessed with qualitative individual
interviews among addiction treatment providers in two Connecticut correctional facilities. In Aim 2, with
implementation recommendations from providers incorporated, CBT4CBT will be implemented through a pilot
clinical trial among 50 incarcerated individuals with current OUD (primary), as well as other SUD(s), to examine
its feasibility and acceptability, as well as preliminary efficacy. Results of this project will inform future efforts to
modify and adapt CBT4CBT to enhance implementation and examine its efficacy as a pre-release intervention
to improve substance use outcomes post-release. Completion of the proposed training plan and research
project will optimally position Dr. Loya to pursue a career as an independent patient-oriented researcher."

overarching goal will be to implement translational, mechanistic and clinical research to uncover the emotional
and biobehavioral origins of parent-infant emotional synchrony and the pathways through which early dyadic

engaging in this protected training time, I will enter my independent stage of research well prepared to lead a
research team purposefully established to study the origins of social cognition from the lens of parent-infant
dyadic emotional synchrony. Studies have found that parent-infant dyads synchronize their heart rhythms and
brain activity during episodes of face-to-face matched behaviors (behavioral synchrony). Biobehavioral
synchrony, i.e., coordination of brain, heart and behavioral signals between parents and infants when engaging
in face-to-face interaction, provides a basis for studying parent-infant dyadic interactions in the first 12 months
as a mechanism leading to improved socio-emotional functioning in later years. The mechanisms underlying
biobehavioral synchrony are still relatively unknown. Here, we hypothesize that emotional synchrony may be a
vehicle strengthening biobehavioral synchrony. The K99 study aims to identify the biobehavioral (Aim 1) and
emotional (Aim 2) correlates of mother-infant emotional synchrony. The R00 study (Aim 3) will expand the K99
aims to mother-infant and father-infant dyads, and link emotional and biobehavioral synchrony to later child
socioemotional functioning."
