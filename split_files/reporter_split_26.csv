10839854,"Research on drug abuse and addiction requires multi-disciplinary approaches. The Biochemical
Pharmacology Core provides services for researchers who do not perform biochemical pharmacology
assays. The techniques provided in this Core allow interrogation of receptors associated with drugs of
abuse and their signaling. Most researchers who used the Core are either behavioral scientists or
chemists. The services provided by the Core are valuable to these investigators, expanded their
research and have resulted in many publications. The Core also has provided preliminary data for grant
applications and several NIH grants were awarded. The receptors of drugs of abuse that the Core has
investigated to date include opioid receptors (MOPR, DOPR, KOPR, NOPR), cannabinoid (CB1 and
CB2) receptors, nicotinic cholinergic receptors (nAChRs) and dopamine and sigma receptors. In the
requested funding period, the Core will perform the following services: (1) Radioligand binding to the
aforementioned receptors related to drug abuse and others when necessary; (2) Assessment of G
protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation, including cAMP level, [35S]GTPγS binding, p44/42 MAP
kinases phosphorylation, β-arrestin recruitment; (3) Determination of agonist bias for GPCRs using
[35S]GTPγS binding or cAMP and β-arrestin recruitment and CRISPR cell lines; (4) Autoradiography of
radioligand binding to opioid and dopamine receptors and (5) Autoradiography of opioid agonist-
promoted [35S]GTPγS binding in brain sections; (6) Immunoblotting of MOPR, KOPR and
phosphorylated KOPR in cultured cells and in rodent brains; (7) Internalization of MOPR, DOPR and
KOPR and CB1 in cultured cells and KOPR in mouse brains; (8) Providing purified antibodies against
MOPR, KOPR and phospho-KOPR to researchers; (9) Training of personnel of other laboratories. For
the requested grant period, the Core will perform at least 15 collaborative projects with NIH-funded
investigators across the country. The innovation lies in the proposed studies, which will address a wide
variety of questions related to drug abuse, including elucidation of impact of adolescent and adult
chronic exposure to morphine, cocaine or nicotine on MOPR, dopamine and/or nAChR expression
and/or signaling in adults and offspring, respectively; search for KOPR agonists that do not cause
KOPR phosphorylation (likely G protein-biased); effects of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
deletion on expression of MOPR and nAChR; screening for allosteric modulators of CB1 receptors and
determination of how they alter ligand binding; and investigation of agonist biases for CB1 and CB2
receptors by using CRISPR cell lines with either individual G proteins or arrestins deleted. The studies
are novel and the Core will augment these research projects beyond the original scope. Thus, the Core
will make significant contribution to the area of substance abuse research."
10839855,"The Cell and Immunology Core of the NIDA P30 Center provides the expertise and resources for
researchers to expand their investigations to include immunological, cellular and histological endpoints.
The capability of carrying out immune assays provides a fertile area for collaborations to investigate the
potential role of chemokines and cytokines in addictive processes. Analyses can be performed on fluids,
tissues, or homogenates obtained from rodents or humans. Many projects supported by the Cell and
Immunology Core investigate the effects of the intersection of drugs with HIV infection in rodent models
or in human tissue or blood samples. The Core has carried out projects relating to effects of a wide
variety of abused substances including opioids, cannabinoids, psychostimulants, nicotine, and alcohol.
The Cell and Immunology Core provides expertise in measurement of chemokines, cytokines, and
hormones in plasma, homogenized brain or brain substructure tissues, brain dialysate fluid, spleen or
lymph node homogenates, and cell culture supernatants using protein arrays, as well as multiplex
platforms for simultaneously measuring a panel of mediators, and by ELISA for assay of levels of single
immune mediators. The Core also offers a variety of histological and tissue imaging techniques for
examining aspects of brain function including receptor expression, microglial activation, dendritic spine
density, and blood-brain barrier integrity. Resources available include tissue processing, embedding,
sectioning and detection using chromogens and fluorescence (single or multiplex). Advanced techniques
offered include tissue clearing (via CLARITY) and special stains such Golgi-cox and Fluro-Jade staining.
In addition, the Core offers epifluorescence, confocal, intravital and live cell microscopy. Image analysis
for area, particle analysis, tracking and 3D volumetric measurements can be performed using dedicated
workstations configured to run NIS elements AR (Nikon) and Imaris (Bitplane). The Core has available
the in-situ hybridization platform from RNAscope to detect RNA in tissues. The Core also carries out
functional immune assays such as the Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction (MLR), an in vitro correlate of organ
and skin graft rejection, response of lymphocytes to mitogens, Natural Killer cell activity, and in vitro
antibody formation. The Core screens cell lines for those doing research in substance abuse for
mycoplasma contamination. The Core is committed to mentoring trainees and faculty new to
immunological assays and imaging analysis by teaching them the theory behind various assays and
instructing them in how to carry out the techniques."
10839857,"The Integrated Physiological Systems and Pain (IPSP) Core, formerly known as the Integrative
Pharmacology Core, provides pharmacological testing, scientific expertise, and related resources to
advance research productivity and spark new areas of scientific discovery in substance abuse
research. The NIDA P30 Center has a rich history in supporting interdisciplinary projects from
established and new investigators, both at Temple University and outside of Temple, that have created
synergy among scientists from different disciplines and linked drug addiction research to disorders such
as pain and HIV. In this 5-year renewal application, the main themes that will be pursued are: (1)
opioids, especially in the context of separating therapeutic (e.g. analgesic) and adverse (e.g.
dependence, tolerance, respiratory depression, constipation) effects; (2) interactions between
substance abuse and HIV in animal models, especially as related to how psychostimulant and opioid
exposure impacts HIV Infectivity, replication, and latency and how HIV infection impacts opioid
dependence and analgesia; and (3) crosstalk between neuroimmune and brain reward systems,
especially in the context of identifying and characterizing neuroimmune biomarkers (e.g. chemokines,
cytokines) of drug addiction and investigating neuroimmune-based therapeutic approaches for
substance abuse. Additional emphasis will be placed on supporting drug discovery projects with high
translational potential such as characterization of bifunctional NOP-MOP (nociception opioid receptor-
mu opioid receptor) agonists, GPR55 ligands, and chemokine receptor antagonists. In terms of
prioritizing projects, and aligning with NIH goals of enhancing investigator diversity, efforts will be made
to support early career investigators and investigators from populations underrepresented in the
biomedical sciences. To expand the impact of NIH-funded research projects related to NIDA's mission
through national collaborations, the implementation of innovative methodology is proposed that will
enable assessment of three new physiological endpoints: (1) in vivo neuronal activity using miniaturized
fluorescence microscopy; (2) respiratory depression for assessment of adverse opioid effects; and (3)
chemotherapy-induce neuropathic pain to screen novel experimental compounds for neuroprotective
and analgesic efficacy. The expected positive impact of the collaborations proposed by the IPSP Core,
through significant interactions with the other Research Support Cores of the NIDA P30 Center, is
facilitation of hypothesis-driven, translational research that links drug addiction to pathologies including
HIV and pain."
10910030,"Discovering interpretable mechanisms explaining high-dimensional biomolecular data
Project summary. How protein and RNA sequence encodes folding, aggregation, and function is a fundamental
question with wide-ranging human health implications. Discovering predictive principles for this encoding
requires computational approaches that offer mechanistic insight, especially for the large fraction of intrinsically
disordered proteins for which experimental structural information is limited. Yet the complexity and dimensionality
of this problem poses fundamental challenges to existing computational methods. The axiomatic approach,
modeling behavior from first-principles, is limited by simulation runtime and unknown context-dependent
parameters. Informatics-based approaches such as deep learning could potentially discover principles by
integrating large datasets across scales and complexity. However, these models produce “black box” predictions
that i) are difficult to understand and ii) generalize poorly beyond their training data (i.e. well-understood regime).
 My lab developed methods to overcome limitations of both types of approaches. (1) Axiomatic: we
developed a statistical physics method to exponentially enhance sampling of protein self-assembly from
structurally heterogeneous monomers in molecular dynamics simulations. (2) Informatic: we invented essence
neural networks (ENNs) based on neurobiological principles and demonstrated that they overcome the above
limitations of deep learning on a wide range of learning tasks, including sequence-to-function prediction.
 Using both axiomatic and informatic approaches, in the next five years my lab will tackle three instances
of the sequence-structure-function problem: 1) Use enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations to
discover transition states of neurotoxic oligomer and fibril formation of Abeta and tau peptide monomers; 2) Use
ENNs to discover the RNA-sequence rules driving RNA-associated tau fibril aggregation in neurodegenerative
disease using tau protein and colocalized RNA sequence datasets; 3) Use ENNs to distill the sequence rules
determining whether a strain or mutant of beta lactamase protein can neutralize each antibiotic within a diverse
drug panel, and identify potential future antibiotic resistant mutants. Our long-term goal is to develop an ENN-
based platform for automated transformation of data into axioms. Leveraging well-established collaborations
with colleagues of wide expertise, we will pursue these goals by combining our unique computational approaches
with experimental resources, including time-resolved protein aggregation assays, patient-derived tau fibrils co-
localized with sequence-specific RNA, high-throughput liquid culture antibiotic screens, multiplexed directed
evolution experiments of antibiotic resistance, and large in-house libraries of peptide and RNA mutant libraries.
 This work lays the foundation for transforming large datasets into human-understandable rules
connecting sequence to function and relating these rules to physical mechanisms of structural dynamics. This in
turn could accelerate disease diagnosis and treatment."

Anesthetics are low affinity drugs that interact with hundreds of molecular targets present throughout the
nervous system at clinically significant concentrations. Despite this molecular-level promiscuity, the hypnotic
effects of anesthetics depend critically on specific neural circuits. This assertion is supported by numerous
results showing that direct modulation of specific sites distributed broadly throughout the brain can potentiate
or, conversely, antagonize the anesthetic state. However, because previous experimental work focused upon
one brain site at a time, the identification of the long-hypothesized brain-wide canonical anesthesia circuit has
so far remained elusive. To fill this critical gap in knowledge, we reasoned that ultimately, the state of
anesthesia must be imposed onto the brain by neurons that remain active under anesthesia, while most other
neurons are suppressed. To identify anesthetic active neurons throughout the brain, we used tissue clearing
and 3D c-Fos immunohistochemistry. We validated that putative anesthesia-active neurons are indeed
physiologically active in vivo using two photon microscopy and fiber photometry. Having identified anesthesia-
active neurons, we further reasoned that brain regions which project broadly are more likely to play a pivotal
role in modulating the level of consciousness. Thus, we combined our brain activity map with whole brain
connectivity analyses. The potent combination of these experimental and bioinformatics approaches allowed
us to identify regions that contain a high density of anesthetic-active neurons and project broadly throughout
the brain. Our unbiased approach culminated in the definition of a putative canonical anesthesia network
comprised of nuclei in the ventral hypothalamus, thalamus, and the prefrontal cortex. In Aim 1, we will discover
the specific cell types within prefrontal cortex, ventral hypothalamus and thalamus that remain active under
anesthesia. This is of critical importance as all brain regions contain many cell subtypes with distinct
neurophysiological properties, connectivity patterns, and ultimately, behavioral effects. In Aim 2, we will
discover the brain-wide projections made by anesthetic-active neurons by combining anterograde and
retrograde viral tracing in transgenic mice that specifically label distinct neuronal subtypes with 3D
immunohistochemistry. In Aim 3, we will establish the functional roles of the canonical anesthesia network as a
whole and each of its elements individually by combining chemo- and optogenetics with behavioral and
neurophysiologic assessments of arousal. The ultimate result of the proposed research will be the identification
of a canonical network of neurons sufficient to elicit hypnosis. This has fundamental implications for how the
state of arousal is controlled in health and dysregulated in disease. Identification of this circuit may also
suggest druggable targets for the development of more specific anesthetic agents with fewer undesirable
effects. This has the potential to significantly improve the care of millions of patients requiring general
anesthesia for life saving procedures."

Rational, structure-based immunogen design for HIV vaccine development has began to deliver
promising results in both, pre-clinical non-human primate (NHP) and clinical studies such as the IAVI
G001 phase I trial [NCT03547245]. Moreover, advances in single cell RNAseq and electron
microscopy-based polyclonal antibody mapping (EMPEM) have enabled analysis of both vaccine and
pathogen-induced antibody responses at unprecedented resolution, further enabling rational vaccine
design. EMPEM and single cell B cell analysis deliver fundamentally different data formats that if
properly integrated, can illuminate immune responses at unprecedented detail. We recently extended
the original negative stain EMPEM method, capable of distinguishing polyclonal antibody epitope
specificities and angle of approach, to high resolution cryoEM-based EMPEM to yield molecular details
of epitope-paratope interfaces. In the best cases we can derive some sequence information for the
complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from structural data, identify Vh/Vl gene usage, and query
databases of antibody sequences to directly generate monoclonal antibodies. As such, we can short
cut the laborious efforts to generate epitope specific monoclonal antibodies using conventional
methods. These molecular details are critical for analyzing shepherding or polishing immunization
strategies that are now being attempted for HIV vaccine development, wherein immunogens are
designed to elicit and mature antibodies with specific features in CDRs that resemble known broadly
neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). In this renewal application we propose to extend the resolution,
throughput, and utility of our EMPEM approach. Moreover, since most pathogens will enter the body
through mucosal surfaces, analysis of (vaccine-induced) mucosal antibodies will be explored. The data
generated will provide new correlates of productive immune responses to the portfolio of exciting HIV
immunogens with epitope focusing or germline targeting properties that will help down select and
prioritize amongst the various approaches being pursued."

This proposal seeks support for launching a new “Integrative Training in Cancer Biology” (ITCB) program, which
will be supervised by a select group of cancer scientists affiliated with the Massey Cancer Center (MCC) at the
Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), a 47-year National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center. The
program will provide contemporary training in cancer biology to both predoctoral and postdoctoral participants,
with priority opportunities given to traditionally underrepresented individuals in cancer biology, including women,
racial/ethnic minorities, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, and those whose families have likely
experienced deep-rooted generational health inequalities. Known national inequality in advanced training
opportunities and health care are interrelated and intrinsically shape each other. It is within this context that the
ITCB program, which will not only provide the most contemporary training in cancer biology but also an intentional
focus on developing scientific approaches designed to address cancer disparities and the important role of
community engagement in research, will ultimately succeed in offsetting the significant cancer disparities faced
not only by MCC’s immediate catchment area but throughout the nation. The ITCB program aims to provide a
two-year training experience to three new predoctoral trainees and one postdoctoral trainee each year, 20 total
trainees over the five-year project period. The main programmatic objectives of the ITCB program are to 1) match
trainees with a mentorship team who will develop a tailored cancer biology-training experience and career
development plan; 2) demonstrate best practices for incorporating community engagement into the design,
implementation, and dissemination of research; 3) provide workshops and hands-on training with experts in
cutting-edge biotechnologies; 4) offer interactive engagement through a unique cancer biology curriculum
infused with the principles of community engagement and cancer disparities; a cancer biology journal club; and
an ITCB program monthly meeting to discuss research in progress, the latest advances in cancer science, and
best practices for laboratory management and career development; 5) promote interdisciplinary engagement
through MCC-sponsored program meetings, seminars, and retreats; 6) afford opportunities to network nationally
through attendance at professional cancer research conferences; and 7) support trainees in developing
extramural, peer-reviewed grant applications and submitting manuscripts based on their research. The ITCB
program will be under the leadership of a Program Director and two Associate Directors who have substantial
backgrounds in cancer biology and notable leadership experiences. The program will receive evaluative input
from an external and an internal advisory committee, and the program faculty includes prominent MCC scientists
who reside in an outstanding interdisciplinary research environment that offers remarkable opportunities for
intellectual, collaborative interactions supported by extensive center-supported resources."
10910023,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Genetic variants in the TRIO gene increase risk for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including
schizophrenia, autism, and related disorders. TRIO encodes a large protein with two guanine nucleotide
exchange factor (GEF) domains for Rho family GTPases: GEF1 activates Rac1 and RhoG, and GEF2 activates
RhoA. We found a cluster of variants associated with autism and intellectual disability that selectively activate or
inhibit TRIO GEF1 activity. While our findings highlight the central importance of this enzyme activity for proper
brain development, the molecular mechanisms by which TRIO GEF1 activity is regulated, the downstream
targets of TRIO GEF1 signaling, and how these processes are disrupted by GEF1-targeting variants remain
fundamental, yet unresolved questions. Answering them will reveal how variants in TRIO lead to NDDs and may
inform new therapeutic interventions. Our proposal will address these questions in three Aims:
Aim 1. To elucidate the mechanism of TRIO GEF1 activation. We discovered that spectrin repeats 6-9 in
TRIO bind and autoinhibit its GEF1 activity and that NDD-associated variants in spectrin repeat 8 relieve this
autoinhibition. A short list of receptors and kinases has been identified as known or likely TRIO GEF1 regulators,
but the mechanisms by which these activators engage TRIO to activate GEF1 activity are unclear. We will use
purified recombinant proteins to test how these receptors’ cytoplasmic domains and kinases impact TRIO GEF1
activity. We will also use a FRET-based activity biosensor and morphological measurements to reveal how these
mechanisms contribute to Rac1/RhoG activation and neuronal development induced by receptor activation.
Aim 2. To identify and characterize the neuronal signaling events regulated by TRIO GEF1 activity. We
have generated mice bearing TRIO variant alleles with reduced (K1431M) or elevated (R1078Q) TRIO GEF1
activity. We will use comparative proteomics and phospho-proteomics in samples from wild-type mice versus
those bearing TRIO GEF1-inhibiting or activating alleles to identify proteins, signaling events, and TRIO-
interaction partners impacted by changes in TRIO GEF1 activity. We will systematically test how manipulation
of these GEF1-mediated events impacts neuronal development and synaptic connectivity.
Aim 3. To measure how selective changes in TRIO GEF1 activity impact neuronal development and
synaptic transmission. Heterozygosity for the GEF1-defective TRIOK1431M allele causes reduced brain size
and behavioral defects, consistent with our hypothesis that selective alterations in TRIO GEF1 activity
compromise normal neuronal development and synaptic function. We will use quantitative histopathology and
electron microscopy in mice bearing the K1431M and R1078Q variants to reveal how altered TRIO GEF1 activity
impacts axon, dendritic arbor, and synapse development. Whole-cell electrophysiology and optogenetic
manipulation will enable us to identify the consequences of changes in TRIO GEF1 activity on neuronal
excitability, synaptic function, and circuit connectivity."
10931375,"ABSTRACT
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is an aggressive primary liver cancer (PLC) that is particularly hard to
treat, having an overall 5-year survival rate of 8%. Like the major PLC, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ICC
incidence is on the rise due to the ongoing increase in cholestatic liver diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases,
type 2 diabetes and alcohol and tobacco abuse. Unlike HCC, ICC is often detected at an advanced stage when
survival prospects are poor, a complication of its imprecise differentiation from early HCC by current radiological
techniques. Early differential diagnosis of two PLCs is critical due to their distinct management and the absence
of targetable oncogenic drivers shared by ICC and HCC. This problem could be solved by identification of a PLC-
type agnostic therapeutic approach, such as immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI), that is applicable to both ICC
and HCC. However, while ICI based therapies were approved for HCC and their efficacy has been improved by
combination with VEGF inhibitors, they have performed poorly in ICC. This failure can be attributed, in part, to
poor mechanistic understanding of the ICC-specific immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and
lack of suitable mouse models that allow the evaluation of ICI in combination with therapeutics capable of
dismantling immunosuppression. We have solved this problem by developing a new ICC model that unlike
previous mouse models does not depend on forced overexpression of potent oncogenic drivers that rapidly
induce ICC in the absence of selective pressure for acquisition of additional mutations. Our MUP-uPA/NRF2Act
model depends on combination of ER stress with activation of transcription factor NRF2 in bipotential
hepatobiliary progenitors and mature hepatocytes and shows robust, highly penetrant, human-like stepwise
progression towards ICC that is accompanied by the buildup of an immunosuppressive TME exhibiting CD8+ T
cell exclusion. We plan to establish the MUP-uPA/NRF2Act mouse as the leading model for studying the evolution
of ICC and its immunosuppressive TME and for finding treatments that will dismantle immunosuppression and
boost the response to existing PD-(L)1 inhibitors. To accomplish this goal, we will fully characterize the MUP-
uPA/NRF2Act mouse, defining the transcriptomic, epigenetic, and genetic alterations at each stage of ICC
progression, including ductular reactions, biliary intraepithelial neoplasia and established desmoplastic cancer.
We will also define the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes at each stage of
malignant progression and mine the transcriptomic data for cancer cell produced factors that mediate
desmoplasia, immunosuppression and CD8+ T cell exclusion. These studies will be complemented by
immunophenotyping and immunodepletion experiments whose goal is the identification of targetable molecular
switches responsible for establishment of the ICC-specific immunosuppressive TME. We will use this information
to identify clinically approved treatments that can overcome immunosuppression and vastly improve the efficacy
of ICI therapy based on PD-(L)1 inhibitors."

The goals of this R01 proposal include the molecular and immunological characterization of vaccine adjuvant
activity associated with processes mediated by the protein Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING). Vaccines
comprised of inert antigen are often only weakly immunogenic and thus require co-administration of adjuvants
to augment immunostimulation. Unfortunately, very few adjuvants are approved for clinical use and the
mechanisms of adjuvant-associated enhancement are poorly understood. STING is a pattern recognition
receptor that detects purine-containing cyclic dinucleotides (CDN) synthesized by either bacterial cyclases or
the host enzyme cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) following its sensing of cytosolic DNA.
Pharmacologic activation of STING greatly enhances vaccine efficacy as indicated by antibody and cell-mediated
protection against diverse microbial pathogens. Furthermore, endogenously synthesized cGAMP is naturally
released from cells in exosomes and virus particles. We exploited this phenomenon by constructing cell lines
that express constitutively active cyclases that we then used to produce immunogenic virus-like particles (VLP).
We now show that VLP derived from unrelated emerging flavi- and alphaviruses efficiently encapsulate bioactive
CDN and stimulate STING-dependent activity in vivo. Since extracellular CDNs are highly susceptible to
degradation and disperse quickly from the site of injection, we hypothesize that this simple approach represents
a transformative technological improvement for harnessing STING-directed adjuvant effects in the draining
lymph node. We also predict this will be a highly adaptable platform and propose to explore the extent to which
it is applicable to potentially emerging virus types. Experimentally, this also represents a unique investigative
model that will allow in vivo characterization of the innate and molecular correlates of adaptive immunity that are
potentiated by targeted STING activity. We thus hypothesize that the enhancement of antigen-directed immune
responses by STING-based adjuvants is functionally linked to key molecular and cellular processes that are
discernable using our proposed vaccines and experimental systems. We plan to explore this using an integrated
approach that uses molecular transcriptomic analysis, mouse models of immune profiling, and nonhuman
primate models of viral growth and protective immunity devised by our group."

 Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC), with an overall 5-year survival of 11%, is the 3rd most common
cause of cancer deaths in the United States, despite accounting for only 2% of all malignancies. Only a minority
of patients (~11%) are diagnosed with “localized” disease (I or IIA), which has a 5-year survival rate of about
40% in setting of a node-negative, margin negative pancreatic resection. An obvious strategy for improving the
dismal survival would be to detect PDAC when localized and thus at a more curable stage. Since screening the
general population for PDAC is not feasible, current efforts have focused on identifying a subset of the people at
an increased risk for PDAC development. Currently, only up to 25% of individuals who develop PDAC are
candidates for pancreatic cancer surveillance. About 10% are individuals with a strong family history or a
combination of family history and germline mutations associated with the risk of PDAC development. The other
~15% are individuals with cystic neoplasms of the pancreas, including IPMNs and MCNs. The inability to predict
the malignant transformation of mucinous cysts and thus identify the cysts that should be surgically removed
requires appropriate surveillance. Despite developing multiple consensus guidelines on managing cystic lesions,
it is still challenging to determine which mucinous cysts will undergo malignant transformation. During the
previous funding cycle, we identified and evaluated novel serum biomarker panels comprising mucins (MUC4,
MUC5AC), mucin-associated glycoepitopes (STRA), TGM2, THSP2, TIMP2, and autoantibodies that were
validated in a blinded case-control cohort aimed at detecting resectable PDAC. Preliminary mutational profiling
of pancreatic cyst fluid (phase I and II) identified a unique panel (PancreaSeq) that helped define the malignant
risk of pancreatic cysts. The goal of the current Clinical Validation Center (CVC) is to validate further these
panel(s) in a prospective-specimen-collection, retrospective-blinded-evaluation (PRoBE) compliant manner in
cohorts of high-risk individuals who are current or potential candidates for early detection or diagnosis of PDAC.
Aim 1 will validate cyst fluid and blood-based biomarkers in patients with cystic lesions to identify advanced
precursor lesions and differentiate low-grade dysplasia and no lethal potential. In this aim, we will validate
candidate biomarkers, including PancreaSeq mutational panel (Phase 3), inflammatory markers (Phase 2), and
mucins (MUC4, MUC5AC, STRA) (Phase 3) in the cyst fluid (high specificity) and serum samples (high
sensitivity) to identify interval malignancy during surveillance imaging. Aim 2 will evaluate the performance of
optimized biomarker panel(s) for early detection of malignant disease in patients with a hereditary predisposition
undergoing surveillance for PDAC development and in patients with new-onset diabetes and chronic pancreatitis,
defined as within two years of initial diagnosis, who are at a significantly increased risk compared to the general
population for having an undiagnosed PDAC. Impact: The proposed studies will validate the clinical utility of
promising biomarker panels for early detection of PDAC and risk stratification of pancreatic cystic lesions, which
can be used in phase IV clinical utility studies."

Understanding the sequence-structure-function relationship of proteins is of vital importance to protein biology,
biomedicine, and bioengineering. Recent advances in biotechnology have been generating rich datasets to
characterize proteins, such as next-generation sequencing data, three-dimensional (3D) structures, ontology
annotations, and measurements of functional activities, yet how to computationally operationalize these datasets
to fully unveil the structural or functional mechanisms of proteins remains a significant challenge. Existing
computational methods often struggle with the size, high-dimensionality, heterogeneity, incompleteness, and
intrinsic noise of those data, limiting our ability to study protein biology in a holistic and integrated system view.
The goal of this research is to develop new artificial intelligence (AI) methods for effectively integrating and
intelligently modeling heterogeneous protein-related datasets and to advance our understanding of the
mechanical connections between proteins’ sequence, structure, and function. This project not only represents
timely research that leverages the unprecedented opportunities offered by recent AI breakthroughs such as
AlphaFold, but also goes beyond these efforts from protein structure prediction to systematic analyses of protein
biology and unlocks new analytic frameworks that could not be realized previously. Specifically, we will first
develop novel machine learning methods to learn statistical representations that are grounded on the sequence
and structure of proteins and reflect their functional properties. The learned representations will allow us to
characterize how the composition of amino acids and the 3D shape of protein structure determine the function
of a protein. Second, we will develop unified, biology-guided deep learning frameworks to integrate domain
knowledge, such as structural properties and evolutionary relationships, and study several key problems for
characterizing protein functions, including genome-scale function annotation and variant effect prediction. These
efforts will shift the classic sequence-first paradigm of previous studies to a new integrative paradigm and provide
accurate, robust, and interpretable predictions of protein functions. Finally, we will develop a computational
platform that combines data-efficient AI models, uncertainty-guided exploration algorithms, and deep learning-
based generative models for AI-aided directed evolution and sequence-structure co-design of proteins, which
will assist and accelerate the discovery and design of functional proteins. Overall, this proposal will study the
sequence-structure-function relationship of proteins from an integrative perspective, provide new state-of-the-art
AI algorithms with applications in fundamental problems for understanding protein function and human disease,
and generate new actionable biological hypotheses for the discovery and design of novel functional proteins.
The resulting software and data resources will be publicly available through open-access platforms."

The study of gene regulation provides fundamental mechanistic knowledge to decipher the development of com-
plex biological systems and design treatment strategies for diseases by manipulating cell states. Development
of single-cell multimodal and multiomics sequencing technologies allows for proﬁling of additional epigenomics
information, such as cis-regulatory elements, which enables inference of gene regulation beyond simply gene
coexpression. However, to more accurately identify gene regulation, computational methods are urgently needed
to incorporate both transcriptomics and epigenomics data measured in the same cell. Recent studies show that
epigenomics changes may foreshadow gene transcription, indicating that gene regulation is an asynchronous
process. A set of regulators may not inﬂuence the target gene along the whole continuous biological process but
only in a small time window. However, current gene regulatory networks inferred from time series data provide
average regulation across time rather than characterizing regulation dynamics. Also, prior evidence shows that
cell–cell communication and interaction are present in spatially localized cell populations as a form of regular-
ized activity. Further incorporating time-varying developmental trajectories in tissue-spatial landscapes will help
categorize the spatial heterogeneity of gene regulation. However, we still lack computational methods to incor-
porate spatio-temporal trajectories in gene regulation inference. To close these gaps, my research program will
(1) develop computational methods and statistical approaches to infer both static and dynamic gene regulatory
networks, (2) leverage the spatial trajectories inferred from multiomics and spatial transcriptomics data to charac-
terize spatial gene regulation, and (3) develop control strategies for gene regulatory networks to achieve desired
states using multi-sample single-cell multiomics data. My long-term goal is to characterize gene regulation across
multiple samples and in spatially separated tissue regions and identify the minimum set of driver genes to manip-
ulate cell states (e.g., cell types). Building on my previous experience in gene regulatory network inference and
methods development to analyze multi-sample single-cell genomics and epigenomics data, I will develop novel
statistical methods to infer gene regulatory networks using multi-sample single-cell multiomics data and char-
acterize time-lagged activities. I will build on my recent work on single-cell pseudotime analysis and single-cell
spatio-temporal trajectories to infer gene regulation in temporal and spatio-temporal contexts. Further, building
on my theoretical research in network control and methods development in analyzing multi-sample single-cell
omics data, I will develop control strategies for gene regulatory networks to achieve desired cell states or cell de-
velopmental trajectories with a minimum set of driver genes. Finally, I will systematically evaluate these methods
across tissues and sample conditions using publicly available data. All methods will be generally applicable in
different tissue or disease contexts. These methods will be released to the community with publicly and freely
available open-source software that can beneﬁt the broad scientiﬁc community."

Development of a universal micro total analysis system (TAS) represents the pinnacle of measurement
science. Integrating all aspects of sample preparation, analysis, and detection into an inexpensive,
automated platform would streamline analyses and enable rapid validation of biomedical samples. The
ideal TAS would not only validate the chemical composition of a biological sample, but also characterize
higher order biomolecule structure (e.g. disulfide bonds, chirality, sulfation) to evaluate bioactivity. To date,
though, these dreams have not been realized. Consequently, researchers must manually prepare samples
for analyses that characterize sample purity, but assessments of biological activity often remain neglected.
This time-consuming, incomplete sample validation risks biasing results of subsequent research studies.
To help improve the rigor and reproducibility of NIH-sponsored projects, we propose to develop a
universal TAS to provide researchers with a tool to rapidly validate biomedical samples, including
evaluations of higher order biological structures that dictate activity. Thermal gel electrophoresis (TGE)
will serve as the heart of the TAS. Our group developed TGE to enrich, separate, and detect
biomolecules within a temperature-responsive gel, thus integrating multiple steps of an analytical method
into an inexpensive microfluidic device. Building on our prior work, we propose to further expand our
capabilities towards the ideal comprehensive TAS. Additional characterizations will be developed to
screen the higher order structure of proteins, peptides, RNAs, and sugars with high selectivity and
sensitivity that are inaccessible to other techniques (e.g. LC-MS). To streamline analyses, sample
preparation capabilities will be integrated into devices to filter cells, desalt samples, and label analytes
for detection. This approach will enable direct analysis of biological samples on-chip, obviating the need
for external sample pretreatment by the user. Additionally, label-free detection schemes will be developed
to further expedite analyses and simplify operational constraints. Collectively, the innovative analytical
strategies developed here will provide a convenient, inexpensive means of characterizing biomedical
samples that cannot be achieved by other techniques. Ultimately, we envision our TGE-based TAS
platform will make robust sample validation accessible to researchers, which will increase reproducibility
of biological studies in academic, government, and industry laboratories."

This new T32 resubmission application supports a postdoctoral research training program in biobehavioral
oncology at the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) in Milwaukee. The two-year Biobehavioral Oncology
Training (BBOT) Program will support two new fellows per year for a steady state of four and total of 10 over the
funding period. Our program integrates the cross cutting theme of cancer disparities from prevention to
survivorship. Our preceptors are members of MCW's Cancer Center, which is on a strong trajectory toward NCI
designation. The BBOT Program is an interdisciplinary program that considers the contribution of biological and
behavioral factors to cancer prevention, control and treatment response through the integration of two themes:
1) the biology of stress and disparities, and 2) social determinants of health, behavior, and outcomes. It is the
first training program in Wisconsin to address the biological and behavioral aspects of cancer prevention and
control and the first cancer-focused training program at MCW. The primary objective of this proposal is to produce
successful independent cancer research leaders who come from diverse population groups to remediate cancer
health disparities by incorporating biological and behavioral aspects into their cancer research. BBOT will be
supported by 20 primary mentors, all funded PIs with grants totaling $18M in annual cancer-relevant extramural
support. Mentors include 13 PhDs, six MDs, and one MD/PhD appointed in 12 departments and
interdepartmental programs. Additionally, six junior mentors with relevant expertise will participate in a Junior
Mentoring Program, serving as associate mentors to BBOT trainees. Collectively, mentors have outstanding
expertise in epidemiology, basic cancer biology, genetics, biostatistics, neuroscience, immunology, and
behavioral medicine and interventions, offering research opportunities focusing on the interactions of genetic,
molecular, neural, psychological, behavioral and social factors and their impact on cancer. Informed by an
individualized development plan, the training program includes four components designed to prepare trainees to
launch and sustain successful research careers: i) didactic learning; ii) multidisciplinary biobehavioral oncology
mentored research experience; iii) career development; and iv) community engagement. Milwaukee is the fifth
poorest and one of the most segregated cities in the US and is home to the majority of Wisconsin's African
American, Hispanic and Hmong communities. The BBOT experience and training goals are designed to develop
a diverse cadre of scientists who will dedicate their careers to ameliorating the persistent cancer disparities
manifest in our city and across the nation. Internal and External Advisory Committees will provide ongoing
evaluation and feedback to ensure that program goals are effectively met. BBOT has enthusiastic and robust
institutional support from the Program Directors' department chairs, the MCW Cancer Center director, and the
dean of the MCW School of Medicine, all of whom have allocated substantial resources to ensure its success."

In our current healthcare system, it often takes years before patients with rare conditions and rare
presentations of common conditions receive a diagnosis. In 2013, the National Institutes of Health supported
the creation of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) to address the needs of these patients, to facilitate
the diagnostic process for those with undiagnosed conditions and generate new knowledge about underlying
mechanisms of disease. The UDN was successful in solving medical mysteries, shortening diagnostic
odysseys, and contributing to biomedical research discovery. In order to serve more patients, the UDN process
must be scaled and integrated into broader healthcare and research ecosystems. As the Data Management
Coordinating Center (DMCC) for a network of Diagnostic Centers of Excellence, Harvard Medical School will
leverage experience in the UDN to create sustainable, nationally scaled infrastructure to support diagnosis,
research, and care for those who are undiagnosed. This will be accomplished by bringing together experts in
trans-institutional data sharing, data analysis, clinical care, bioinformatics, novel diagnostics, and translational
research and creating three DMCC Cores - Administrative, Data Management, and Clinical Research Support -
to address unmet needs of the undiagnosed. The Administrative Core will unite the DMCC and support
activities of all three Cores. Together, the DMCC Cores will accomplish four aims: 1) Scale up UDN throughput
by at least an order of magnitude to meet a pressing national need, 2) Leverage partnerships for sustainable
coordination of diagnostic processes to increase patient autonomy while advancing opportunities for
investigative science, 3) Maximize data mobility, interpretability, and shareability, and 4) Provide analytic
service and data stewardship through the Data Management Core and Clinical Research Support Cores led by
experts in genomics and AI teaming with clinicians and researchers."
10907522,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) carries the highest morbidity and mortality of all stroke subtypes due to the
initial injury and the ongoing bleeding, otherwise known as hematoma expansion (HE), which can occur
afterwards. HE occurs acutely within 24 hours in up to 30% of patients with ICH and is the strongest driver of
worse outcomes in this patient population. Consequently, acute ICH treatment paradigms largely focus on
preventing HE utilizing rapid transfusion based approaches in efforts to improve outcome. However, recent
trials using generalized, rapid transfusion based treatment approaches with coagulation factors or platelet
transfusions to prevent HE have not yielded improved outcomes. This emphasizes a critical knowledge gap in
approaches and treatment targets of HE.
Lower red blood cell (RBC) levels have been associated with bleeding with proposed mechanisms being due
to suboptimal radial displacement of platelets and endothelial binding. While evidence in ICH has consistently
revealed an association of low RBC levels with worse outcomes, this has largely been attributed to impaired
cerebral oxygenation rather than coagulopathy. This extrapolates the associations of low RBC levels with
impaired cerebral oxygenation and poor clinical outcomes from subarachnoid hemorrhage and traumatic brain
injury patient populations as no such studies have yet been performed in ICH. However, there is evidence of
larger baseline hematoma volumes and more recently, increased HE in ICH patients with lower baseline RBC
levels to suggest a role of coagulopathy related to RBC levels in these patients.
The role of RBCs on functional coagulation and cerebral oxygenation after ICH will be investigated via a)
reductionist murine models of anemia, ICH and RBC transfusions and b) a prospective observational human
ICH study evaluating the relationship of RBC levels and RBC transfusions on independent changes in
functional coagulation and cerebral oxygenation. This project will fill an important gap in ICH treatment
paradigms by establishing novel tools to investigate mechanisms of RBC levels on ICH outcomes in order to
ultimately inform future clinical transfusion based treatment approaches in patients with ICH to improve their
outcomes."
10861727,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Many aggressive cancers have a robust tumor microenvironment composed of heterogenous stromal and
immune cells. Although the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors has shifted therapeutic targets of cancer
research to include tumor-cell extrinsic targets, the therapeutic potential of targeting the tumor stroma remains
underexploited. Recently, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been implicated as drivers of disease
progression. From preliminary attempts to harness the therapeutic potential of targeting CAFs, it has become
clear that targeting CAFs as a bulk population of cells will not be sufficient. As such, there have been efforts in
breast and pancreatic cancer to define the heterogeneity of CAFs. These efforts have yielded diverse subtypes
commonly described by two overarching groups: myofibroblast CAFs (myCAFs) and inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs).
In pancreatic cancer, myCAFs are observed to be tumor-adjacent and iCAFs are more distant from tumor cells.
While defining subtypes of CAFs is a necessary first step, the development of novel therapeutic approaches will
likely require the identification of specific functions of CAF subtypes. To this end, Wnt2 has been identified as
upregulated in CAFs from pancreatic, breast, and colorectal cancer, yet the role of CAF-driven Wnt signaling on
tumor progression remains largely unknown. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a lethal disease (~3-5 month
median survival) with an abundant tumor stroma and no efficacious treatment options. The composition of the
tumor stroma in ATC has been largely unexplored. My preliminary work identifies a prominent fibroblast
population in ATC that expresses WNT2. As ATC is known to have upregulated Wnt signaling relative to other
thyroid neoplasms, this provides a unique opportunity to study the dynamics of CAF-driven Wnt signaling. The
goal of this proposal is to define the CAF subtypes present in thyroid carcinoma and determine the functional
role of CAF-derived Wnt2 on tumor growth. I hypothesize that distinct CAF populations promote tumor growth
and invasion in thyroid carcinoma through Wnt signaling and have unique spatial relationships. To test my
hypothesis, I will perform experiments in ATC models and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) models. PTC is a
predominantly indolent thyroid carcinoma that can transform to ATC in vivo, making it ideal for examining the
ability of CAFs to promote disease progression. In aim 1, I will elucidate subtypes of CAFs present in ATC and
PTC and probe Wnt ligand-receptor interactions. Further, I will determine spatial resolution of myCAF and iCAF
fibroblast populations in thyroid carcinoma. In aim 2, I will utilize >40 primary patient thyroid carcinoma CAF
cultures that our lab has collected to demonstrate the role of CAF-derived Wnt2 signaling both paracrine on PTC
and ATC tumor cells and autocrine to shape the phenotype of CAFs. In completing these studies, I will for the
first time define the heterogeneity of CAFs in thyroid carcinoma and characterize a potential novel therapeutic
target applicable to CAFs in multiple cancer types."
10810667,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In recent years, there have been groundbreaking discoveries in the identification and therapeutic targeting of
the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint axis. Lung cancer cells express high levels of Programmed Death Ligand
1 (PD-L1), a critical ligand for PD-1 on T cells. The PD-1/PD-L1 interaction allows tumor cells to directly
suppress anti-tumor T cell activity, resulting in immune escape and tumor progression. Despite these
advances, there remains a disconnect in patient expression of PD-L1 and treatment response. This
underscores the critical need to understand mechanisms of PD-L1 upregulation, identify mechanisms of
resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, and identify other immune checkpoints or pathways to pursue clinically in
combination with this therapy. In response to tumor microenvironment stresses, such as hypoxia, heme
deprivation, and amino acid starvation, cancer cells activate the integrated stress response (ISR). ISR
activation allows cancer cells to escape these stresses through inhibition of global protein synthesis and
increased translation of select mRNAs. The ISR has been shown to promote tumorigenesis, yet the role of the
ISR in the translational control of immune checkpoint proteins has not been fully investigated. We recently
demonstrated that ISR activation leads to potent induction of PD-L1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and
suppression of anti-tumor immunity in vitro and in vivo, and we have new evidence that another immune
checkpoint, CD155 (Cluster of differentiation 155), is induced upon ISR activation in NSCLC cells
simultaneously with PD-L1. Our central hypothesis is that ISR activation causes tumor cell immune escape
through translation of both PD-L1 and CD155. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will test this hypothesis
by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Elucidate the mechanisms through which ISR activation promotes
translation of CD155; 2) Determine the effect of ISR modulation on immune cell responses; 3) Examine the
therapeutic efficacy of ISR inhibition in combination with PD-1 blockade and/or TIGIT (CD155’s immune cell
receptor) blockade in mouse models. We will employ translational studies including luciferase reporter assays
and ribosome profiling to dissect the mechanisms of ISR mediated PD-L1 and CD155 translational control in
NSCLC cells. To determine the impact of ISR activation on immune cell responses, we will measure immune
cell responses in co-culture studies and immunocompetent mouse models upon ISR activation. Finally, we will
utilize mouse models and ISR inhibitors to determine whether ISR inhibition can suppress tumorigenesis by
promoting an immune response and whether this can synergize with existing immune checkpoint therapies
(Fig 1, model). Our proposed research is significant, because it will 1) uncover new regulatory circuits that
govern immune checkpoint protein expression, 2) illuminate how insults experienced by cancer cells in the
tumor microenvironment modulate the responses of immune cells, and 3) our studies will provide proof-of-
concept for the development of new combination therapies for lung cancer."
10889158,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Ten percent of adults over 65 suffer from Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and this number is projected to double by
2050. Thus, understanding and reducing AD risk factors is of critical importance, particularly in the absence of
an effective treatment. Epidemiological evidence suggests that depression throughout the lifespan contributes to
AD risk, although depression in late life also may be part of the dementia prodrome. Clinicopathological studies
have provided robust support for the importance of amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition in the pathogenesis of AD, and
evidence supports an association between Aβ and depression. However, most studies that have examined the
relationship between MDD and Aβ have included individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI),
complicating our understanding of the relationship between MDD and Aβ. Levels of soluble Aβ are influenced
by the presence of deposited Aβ and our preliminary data suggests that they also are associated with the severity
of depression symptoms. Using a number of depression rating scales, our data also show that changes in residual
symptoms in people with geriatric depression who do not have significant cognitive decline are correlated with
Aβ changes in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma. However, the direction and nature of the causal
relationship between MDD symptoms and Aβ peptide levels are unknown. Given the relationship between Aβ
and AD risk, elucidating the relationship between amyloid dynamics and depression symptoms would allow us
to better understand the mechanism for heightened AD risk imparted by MDD. Since the direction of causation
between depression and Aβ is unknown, the only way to understand cause and associated risk is to treat the
depressive symptoms and examine the effects on AD biomarkers in relation to antidepressant treatment
response. We propose to study 90 cognitively-normal older adults with current episode of MDD and no evidence
of MCI in an 8-week, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized study using the SSRI
antidepressant escitalopram. The hypothesis is that a reduction in depressive symptoms and treatment response
will be associated with an increase in the levels of CSF Aβ40 and Aβ42, as well as a reduction in vascular
dysfunction markers, including platelet activation. The results of the proposed clinical trial will build on our
understanding of the relationship between MDD symptoms and the biological variables implicated in AD, and
thus provide a significant target for reducing AD risk. If successful, this approach might lead to more effective
strategies for reducing the risk of developing AD through more effective treatment of late-life MDD."
10911302,"The development of new technologies for detection of environmental contaminants have increased considerably
in the last 15 years. The technology in the form of new sensors, smartphone applications, and wearables devices
are widely available for researchers as well as consumers interested in obtaining environmental data. For
industrial hygienists, the availability of new sensors allows for the collection of greater spatial and temporally
resolved data which improves anticipation, recognition, measurement, and control of workplace exposures. This
proposal builds on a long-standing collaboration between the City University of New York School of Public Health
(CUNY SPH) and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in the NIOSH New York/New Jersey Educational
Research Center while adding new collaborations with CUNY’s Queens College and the CUNY Advanced
Science Research Center. The overall goal of this proposed training program is to add significant new training
and research opportunities for industrial hygiene students at the CUNY SPH in the hands-on use of sensor
technology and laboratory. Students will be trained to recognize and utilize state of the art new technologies that
can be used to quantify contaminants in the workplace such as total volatile organic compounds, particulate
matter, heat exposure, noise and ultraviolet radiation. This proposal will expand upon the existing NIOSH funded
industrial hygiene program to: 1) revise existing industrial hygiene curriculum to include training in laboratory
practices and sensor technologies, 2) fund student research projects in the evaluation and applicability low-cost
sensors to quantify workers’ exposure, 3) develop an outreach and training program in industrial hygiene for
Spanish speaking occupational health and safety trainers who train construction and other low wage Latinx
immigrant workers. We will provide five graduate assistantships per year for students to work with faculty mentors
in the research areas of sensor technologies or worker outreach programs. In addition, approximately 35
students in the Department of Environmental, Occupational, and Geospatial Health Sciences at the CUNY SPH
will enroll in updated laboratory and didactic courses. The program will also provide training to enhance the skills
of a group of 40 trainers associated with Latinx community-based organization in the New York/New Jersey
region who provide training in occupational safety and health in Spanish to low wage workers. By integrating
graduate training programs for industrial hygiene students with community-based training for occupational safety
and health trainers serving for low wage Latinx workers, this program will promote a commitment to community
engagement and service among our industrial hygiene trainees assisted by the enhanced use of low-cost sensor
technologies to identify, measure and control workplace exposures."
10899699,"Project Summary
 Nodal dysfunction in patients often requires the implantation of a pacemaker to maintain
physiologically normal heart rates. Historically, a pacemaker in the right ventricular apex has delivered
pacing pulses to the ventricles. In some patients, chronic pacing in the right ventricle may lead to
ventricular dyssynchrony, pacing induced cardiomyopathy, and increased congestive heart failure
incidence. Biventricular pacing has been shown to lead to improved performance compared to right
ventricular pacing, but up to 1/3 of patients are non-responders to biventricular pacing. Permanent His
bundle and left bundle branch (LBB) pacing has recently been shown to lead to less heart failure and
improved synchronicity, with a trend towards a mortality benefit as compared to the standard right
ventricular or biventricular lead placement.
 Limitations that have slowed the adoption of His bundle pacing include 1) higher pacing
thresholds as compared to other lead configurations, which may reduce battery life in implanted devices
for patients with high pacing demand, and 2) a lack of selectivity in sensing and pacing the His bundle
and adjacent ventricular myocardium. Therapies such as antitachycardia pacing (ATP) that utilize
sensing may be less effective if the His activation and the local myocardial activations lead to
inappropriate calculation of the ventricular tachycardia (VT) cycle length.
 ATP is an effective technique to terminate ventricular tachycardias without delivering high-energy,
painful shocks. However, efficacy of ATP techniques with a His bundle or LBB lead has not been
demonstrated. Using a canine model of ischemia-reperfusion induced VT, the hypothesis will be tested
that ATP will utilize the His-Purkinje network to terminate VT with greater efficacy than standard right
ventricular lead ATP therapy.
 A novel, transvenous, multielectrode pacing lead is proposed that will allow for low threshold,
selective sensing and pacing of the His bundle and the adjacent ventricular myocardium. Refinement of
the lead configuration will be performed in ex vivo canine hearts, and validation of the new lead will be
demonstrated in an in vivo, chronic dog model. The lead configuration will be deployable with currently
available tools and techniques and will allow the physician to optimize the pacing therapy based on the
response of individual patients.
 Completion of this project will lead to a substantially improved lead system for His bundle pacing
and LBB applications and demonstrate the effectiveness of ATP therapy with His bundle and LBB leads.
This translational project may have an immediate impact on pacemaker implantation for many of the one
million patients worldwide that are implanted with pacemakers each year."
10909122,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a global problem due to an alarming increase in the number of individuals with
diabetes. The lack of an early diagnostic tool predicting retinal vascular health is a critical barrier to progress. To
this end, we have identified circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) as ideal reporter cells, which are most receptive
to changes of diabetic milieu and retinopathy. Our preliminary studies suggest that CACs map a distinct RNA
signature. We also found that a miRNA, miR-92a, is downregulated explicitly in CACs with DR, and its
overexpression in CACs of people with diabetes decreased pro-inflammatory markers, such as IL-1β and CD14,
emphasizing the importance of CACs for biomarker discovery of retinal vascular health. Our preliminary studies
using machine learning models could accurately predict DR providing us a stronger rationale for developing this
paradigm for our robust study design. Furthermore, using rodent models, we found a decrease in miR-92a in
lineage-Sca1+c-kit+ (LSK; mouse equivalent of CACs) parallels with an increase in acellular capillaries, and miR-
92a inhibition in LSKs triggered a stronger inflammatory response. Therefore, this proposal's overarching goal
is to study RNA (miRNA and mRNA) and inflammatory signature using a robust sequencing paradigm and
differential modeling in individuals with different severities of DR and animal models to gain insights into retinal
vascular health. Our central hypothesis is that RNA signature in CACs mirror DR severity, and miR-92a
decrease within CACs serves as a candidate biomarker. We propose the following specific aims to test our
hypothesis: Aim 1: To assess changes in RNA levels in CACs of patients with different severity of DR and
validate miR-92a as a candidate biomarker. Aim 2: Determine whether the miR-92a loss in bone marrow cells
is associated with the development of DR in rodents. We anticipate that our proposed studies will identify specific
mRNA and miRNA changes of DR severity and validate miR-92a as a novel biomarker for retinal vascular health.
Overall, our studies will help improve the standard of care of DR individuals by aiding in diagnosis, prognosis
and providing mechanistic insights for future therapies."

Since 2002 when my laboratory discovered GATA1 mutations in all cases acute megakaryocytic leukemia in
children with Down syndrome, I have been at the forefront of defining the specific genetic events that promote
leukemia. I have extensively studied the role of GATA1 in normal and malignant hematopoiesis and gained many
insights into the contributions of several chromosome 21 genes, including DYRK1A, ERG and CHAF1B, in
leukemia. My laboratory is also well established in the field of the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs),
especially in the role of megakaryocytes in the pathogenesis of myelofibrosis and the development of new
therapies for this disease. In this R35 application, I propose to focus my laboratory over the next 7 years (and
beyond) on understanding the mechanisms of leukemia progression from clonal hematopoietic disorders.
Specifically, we will identify and compare the ways that pediatric and adult disorders progress to acute myeloid
leukemia. We will leverage large scale CRISPR/Cas9 screening, animal models and primary patient samples to
deeply characterize the mechanisms of transformation and focus on answering three questions: 1) What are the
similar and disparate events that promote malignant progression of pediatric versus adult blood disorders? 2)
How does dysregulation of pathways downstream of identified tumor suppressor genes promote malignant
progression? 3) Which investigational or approved therapies can prevent progression or treat the tumors? The
answers to these questions will increase our basic understanding of cancer, reveal new therapeutic targets and
possibly shed light on chemoprevention strategies."
10888156,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The incidence of Achilles tendon injury in youth sports has increased, yet Achilles tendon pathology in
adolescents has been poorly investigated. While the overuse injury of Achilles tendinopathy is clinically
diagnosed by pain with loading and loss of function in adults, the same symptoms in adolescents are instead
considered a growth plate disorder called calcaneal apophysitis. Calcaneal apophysitis and Achilles
tendinopathy may onset at different times during musculoskeletal growth in adolescents who consistently
overload their tendons. However, the involvement of Achilles tendon pathology amongst adolescents with
general heel pain is unknown. Further, the etiology of Achilles tendon injury has yet to be determined in the
adolescent population. It is speculated that an overdevelopment of triceps surae muscle alters Achilles tendon
structure (i.e., morphology and mechanical properties), resulting in heel pain during loading and loss of
function. With no clear clinical diagnostic delineation between apophysitis and tendinopathy for patients under
18 years old with heel pain, overlooking Achilles tendon pathology may result from an assumed diagnosis of
calcaneal apophysitis. Misdiagnosis and subsequent misaligned treatment of Achilles tendon injury in
adolescents can reduce quality of life and may impede the development of a physically active lifestyle into
adulthood. The growing incidence rates of lower limb tendinopathies in adolescence, and premature retirement
from youth sports due to debilitating injury, stress the need for adequate understanding of Achilles tendon
injury. Yet, Achilles tendon pathology research is disproportionately focused on the adult population, potentially
leaving the pediatric population at risk of long-term health issues.
The objective of this proposal is to investigate the effect of heel pain on adolescent Achilles tendon
health and lower limb biomechanics. Specifically, this study will evaluate Achilles tendon symptoms and
lower limb impairments (Aim 1), Achilles tendon structure and triceps surae muscle strength alterations (Aim
2), and Achilles tendon loading profiles (Aim 3) of adolescents with complaints of heel pain compared to
healthy adolescents. This work will contribute valuable evidence for establishing the pathoetiology of
adolescent heel pain, which is necessary to properly diagnosis and treat adolescents with heel pain so they
can maintain physically active lifestyles into adulthood. The long-term goal of this fellowship applicant is to
investigate mechanisms of musculoskeletal injury and improve clinical rehabilitation. The interdisciplinary
training this applicant will receive from expert biomedical researchers and clinical collaborators at the
University of Delaware during the proposed fellowship will make her a valuable investigator, with proficiencies
in clinical testing, innovative imaging techniques, and novel computational modeling. Further, this proposal will
facilitate the applicant’s postdoctoral training, laying the foundation for a career as an independent clinical
scientist and strong advocate for diversity in health science fields."
10810670,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Suicide is the second leading cause of death among early adolescents (i.e., ages 10-14), and adolescent
suicide rates have nearly tripled in recent years. Self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs), such as non-
suicidal self-injury, suicidal ideation, and suicidal behavior, commonly first occur during this period. Completed
suicide is often preceded by SITBs, making understanding risk factors for SITBs in early adolescence a
research priority. Experiences of discrimination are identified by Healthy People 2030 as a key social
determinant of health. Various types of discrimination, including due to sexual identity and race/ethnicity, are
known to be associated with higher risk of SITBs in early adolescence. Weight discrimination, among the most
common types of discrimination in early adolescence, may also be associated with SITBs, but the existing
evidence is limited. Sexual and gender minority (SGM) early adolescents, an NIH health disparities population,
are about four times as likely as non-SGM early adolescents to experience SITBs, and they are also more
likely to report weight discrimination. Thus, weight discrimination may be a particularly important risk factor for
SITBs among SGM individuals, but this has yet to be studied among early adolescents. I propose to address
these important gaps in the literature through a secondary analysis of data from the Adolescent Brain and
Cognitive Development Study, a study of a large national sample of adolescents that is among the first to
include measures of weight discrimination, SITBs, SGM identity, and other pertinent variables. Guided by an
adaptation of Meyer’s Minority Stress Model, my specific aims are to (1) examine the association between
weight discrimination and SITBs in adolescents ages 11-12 and (2) determine whether the association
between weight discrimination and SITBs differs for SGM adolescents and heterosexual, cisgender
adolescents. Additionally, in an exploratory aim I will explore potential differences in the association between
weight discrimination, SGM identity, and SITBs based on SGM-related stress, racial/ethnic discrimination, and
sex assigned at birth. Findings will inform future interventions to prevent suicide and promote mental health
among adolescents (especially SGM adolescents) by addressing social determinants of health such as
discrimination. The proposed aims align with the NINR’s Research Lenses of Prevention and Health
Promotion, Social Determinants of Health, and Health Equity. To facilitate the proposed research, I will build
my knowledge and skills in adolescent mental health, SGM health, data science, multilevel modelling, and
moderation analysis. With the mentorship of a dedicated and NIH-funded interdisciplinary sponsorship team,
and the resource-rich environment of Columbia University, I will build a strong foundation from which to move
toward my long-term goal of becoming an independent, interdisciplinary nurse scientist with expertise in
promoting adolescent mental health, particularly among SGM adolescents."

Progress toward promoting health and well-being as we age must include the identification of novel targets that
are safe, powerful, inexpensive, and deployable. Our focus is on one such target—patient memory for the
contents of treatment—because: (1) patient memory for treatment is poor, (2) poor memory for treatment is
associated poorer adherence and poorer outcome, (3) memory support strategies can improve memory for
treatment and (4) improved memory for treatment improves outcome. In this application, we propose to test a
new, streamlined, and potent approach to engaging this novel target: the Memory Support Intervention (MSI).
The MSI aims to improve patient memory for treatment. It was distilled from the basic, non-clinical research in
cognitive science and education and is comprised of four powerful memory promoting strategies that are
proactively, strategically, and intensively integrated into treatment-as-usual. Importantly, the MSI does not add
to session length, or the number of sessions needed. The aim of this proposal is to conduct a confirmatory
efficacy trial to test whether the MSI improves outcomes for midlife and older adults. As a “platform” for the
next step in investigating this approach, we focus on sleep and circadian problems and the Transdiagnostic
Intervention for Sleep and Circadian Dysfunction (TranS-C). TranS-C is a worthy platform on which to test
the MSI because (1) sleep and circadian functioning, including and beyond insomnia, is highly prevalent
among midlife and older adults, (2) poor sleep and circadian functioning has a wide range of serious negative
consequences, including on memory and (3) TranS-C addresses a range of the most common sleep and
circadian problems experienced by midlife and older adults. Promising pilot data suggest that memory for
TranS-C may be poorer among midlife and older adults, relative to younger adults, and that adding memory
support has potential to improve treatment adherence and treatment outcome for this age group. Over 5 years,
we will recruit adults who are 50 years and older and who are experiencing sleep and circadian problems (N =
178, including 20% for attrition). The sample will be randomly allocated to TranS-C plus the MSI (“TranS-
C+MSI”) vs. TranS-C alone, and all will receive eight 50-minute, weekly, individual sessions. Assessments will
be conducted at baseline, post-treatment, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. The sample will be recruited from
two large community-based organizations that serve midlife and older adults who are low-income and
experiencing mobility impairments. The intervention will be delivered via live telehealth to improve accessibility.
We will compare the effects of TranS-C+MSI vs. TranS-C alone to determine if the MSI improves sleep and
circadian functioning, daytime functioning, and well-being (Aim 1). We will determine if patient memory for
treatment (the target) mediates the relationship between treatment condition and outcome (Aim 2). We will
evaluate if previously reported poor treatment response subgroups moderate target engagement (Aim 3). The
MSI could be added to a range of interventions to enhance intervention outcomes for midlife and older adults."

number of UR students in biomedical and behavioral sciences research careers. Design: This training model
has three sequential phases over the 24-month trainee appointment: Pre-Bridge at the Community College,
with emphasis on preparation for success; Bridging, with an emphasis on ensuring a successful transfer to
PSU; and Integration at PSU, with an emphasis on engagement with the PSU community. Specific aims of
B2B include supporting diverse students in their transfer process to PSU, having trainees begin developing an
Individual Development Plan (IDP) for attainment of a PSU degree prior to the start of their sophomore year at
the community college, providing targeted up-skilling and course-taking to increase their chances of success in
bridging to PSU, integrating into programs and biomedical research training at PSU, and improving time-to-
degree and attainment outcomes. This is a two-year scaffolded training program designed to support UR
students interested in biomedical research careers through mentoring, tailored curriculum, and hands-on
mentored research experiences. Data collection and analysis will be focused on institutional levers that can
best support UR biomedical students through the transfer process and retain them through degree completion."
10931472,"Core B: Project Summary/Abstract
The mass spectrometry core has expertise in proteomics/phosphoproteomics, metabolomics and lipidomics
resources to enable the three major P01 projects achieve success in uncovering the molecular mechanisms of
Hamartoma syndromes and related cancers in the TSC1-TSC2 pathways for new drug targets and novel
therapies using tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The core utilizes both high resolution hybrid Orbitrap
(Exploris 480, QExactive HF) mass spectrometry and hybrid triple quadrupole (QTRAP 6500/5500) mass
spectrometry. For proteomics, microcapillary tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) services will include
protein complex identification, global post-translational modification (PTM) site mapping such as
phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, etc. and the relative and absolute quantification of peptides/proteins
using both stable isotope labeling (SILAC and TMT) and label-free quantification [spectral counting, total ion
current (TIC), multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)]. These studies will be performed from cell lines, xenografts in
addition to in vivo tissue sources from mouse/human tumors and drosophila models. We have developed
expertise in metabolomics profiling and services will include polar metabolite profiling using selected reaction
monitoring (SRM) with polarity switching to target more than 300 molecules in 15 min. We will profile cells, tumor
tissues and biological fluids using both steady-state profiling and 13C and 15N stable isotope labeled flux
experiments to determine which metabolic pathways are altered in cells harboring defects in the TSC1/2 related
pathways. Non-targeted metabolomic profiling by HR-LC-MS/MS will also be performed to discover novel
metabolic targets. Core B will use non-targeted lipidomics based on high resolution mass spectrometry with
polarity switching with novel software to identify more than 1500 lipid ions (phospholipids, triglycerides, free fatty
acids, etc.) in less than 30 min. using reversed-phase LC-MS/MS. We will also use recently developed stable
13C/15N/18O isotope flux for lipidomics. In addition to running samples for Projects 1-3, Core B has developed
a serial-omics technology that utilizes the preparation of a single tisue, cell or bodily fluid sample for performing
three different –omics (global phosphoproteomics/proteomics, metabolomics and lipidomics) via partitioning
liquid-liquid extraction layers. We will also continue to develop -omics strategies to overlap model species
(drosophila) to cancer cells and tumor tissue to uncover conserved biological interactions for potential biomarker
targets in TSC1/2 and related pathways."

Living systems choreograph molecular events with precise control—place, time, kinetics, and intensity
—and record memories of those occurrences in synaptic networks, gene expression, epigenetic
marks, and myriad other circuits that govern the where&when of biologic responses. Visualizing this
choreography and tracing these histories are tasks that chemists and biologists can accomplish with
only partial accuracy, considerable eﬀort, and limited temporal range. Our research agendas are thus
focused on constructing new chemical tools for temporospatial analysis of living systems, and
organized around the emergent properties that result from deploying next-level bioorthogonal
chemistries within multi-layered (bio)molecular architectures. The resulting hybrid systems circumvent
perennial challenges, achieving: i) simultaneous speed/stability, for eﬃcient real-time molecular
machinery and longitudinal performance in vivo; ii) sensitivity for detection of rare/unique events; and
iii) speciﬁcity/multiplicity, for accurate detection and ﬁne-grained molecular encoding of (sub)cellular
histories across time.
Building on the momentum of ongoing mechanistic investigations and the success of our recent eﬀort
to achieve multiplexed imaging of living cells and tissues, our goals for the next ﬁve years extend
bioorthogonal chemistry in applications that exploit two/three dimensional topologies, rather than
singular ligation/cleavage events, and in architectures that leverage nucleic acid hybridization to
encode sequence recognition, accelerate reaction kinetics, and enable signal ampliﬁcation. In one set
of projects, we aim to create self-amplifying programmable bioorthogonal reactions, elaborate the
capabilities of this new toolkit, and apply them to transform our methods for visualizing living cells and
tissues. In another, we have envisioned sequence-generating architectures that convert biocompatible
chemical reactivity into ampliﬁable biological information, establishing the concepts of bioorthogonal
translation and sequegenicity. With scaﬀolds that readily integrate into the workﬂows of existing high-
performance nucleic acid biotechnologies, we anticipate broad applicability and rapid downstream
development of a new generation of tools for tracking (bio)molecules, individual cells, and populations."
10895440,"Project Summary
Transfer RNA (tRNA) is best known to function in ribosome-mediated protein synthesis. However, in a
less known role, arginyl-tRNA is essential for catalyzing a unique and poorly understood protein post-
translational modification, namely arginylation, that regulates protein turnover. In this arginylation reaction,
ATE1 (Arginyltransferase 1) facilitates arginine transfer to protein targets using a mechanism that
depends on, and is selective for, arginyl-tRNA(Arg) as the donor cofactor. ATE1-mediated protein
arginylation was identified on hundreds of proteins and is recognized as a global regulator of eukaryotic
cellular processes, including embryogenesis, stress responses, and aging. Deregulation of ATE1 is found
in patients with Parkinson’s disease and metastatic prostate, liver, and skin cancers. Nonetheless, how
ATE1 (and other aminoacyl-tRNA transferases) hijacks tRNA from the highly efficient ribosomal protein
synthesis pathways and catalyzes the arginylation reaction remains a mystery. This proposal aims to
elucidate the catalytic mechanism and regulation of ATE1-mediated protein arginylation in vitro and in
cells. We will focus on interrogating the activity of ATE1 and the consequences of arginylation at three
scales. Firstly, we will determine the molecular mechanisms ATE1 selects for arginyl-tRNA(Arg) and
recognizes specific sites in protein targets through an integrative approach combining structural,
biochemical, and biophysical methods. Once determined, this research will allow a better understanding
of the growing classes of aminoacyl-tRNA transferases in general. Secondly, we will quantitatively
determine the consequences of arginylation on target protein turnover in living cells. Protein degradation
usually depends on poly-ubiquitination, a downstream or concurrent event following arginylation, and
through either proteasomal or autophagy-lysosomal pathways. By examining specific model substrates
for proteasome or autophagosome under normal or stressed conditions, we will determine the crosstalk
between arginylation and ubiquitination; delineate the contribution of each degradation pathway; reveal
the kinetics in cells. Lastly, we will investigate whether and how core components of the ribosomal
translation machinery and nutrients affect protein arginylation. Mechanistically, these studies will expand
our knowledge of the regulatory roles of amino acids and tRNAs, enrich our toolbox to study
macromolecule regulation by tRNA-dependent aminoacylation, and reshape how we consider the
functions of the charged tRNAs beyond protein synthesis. Together, this research provides fundamental
knowledge about arginylation, lays the groundwork for discovering novel therapeutic strategies by
modulating ATE1 activity and protein arginylation in Parkinson’s disease and metastatic cancers, and
enables us to build integrative platforms for future research."

 Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) represent approximately 12-15% of all NHL in the western world and are
associated with dismal prognosis. Furthermore, the diagnosis is challenging as 30-50% of PTCL cases cannot be
assigned to a specific entity and are categorized as PTCL-not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS). We have defined
robust gene expression signatures that can differentiate the five common PTCLs entities: angioimmunoblastic T-cell
lymphoma (AITL), anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALK (+) ALCL), ALK-
negative anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALK (-) ALCL), adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), and extra-nodal
natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTCL). PTCL-NOS can be divided into two distinct biological and prognostic
subgroups (PTCL-TBX21 and PTCL-GATA3 subgroups). We translated the RNA based diagnostic and prognostic
algorithms for formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues for widespread clinical usage with high sensitivity and
specificity. We also identified distinguishing genetic lesions in PTCL subtypes using corresponding DNA , and
demonstrated that such lesion can be validated using shallow whole genome analysis (sWGA) in corresponding
plasma cell-free DNA, thus liquid biopsy can aid in diagnosis and disease monitoring.
 Since the biospecimen processing, and hence quality, varies significantly in routine clinical pathology laboratories,
the reliability of RNA or DNA based signatures need to be evaluated under variable circumstances. It is essential to
determine how the robustness of the assay may be affected by pre-analytical variables before the novel diagnostic
tools can be applied to large studies or routine clinical practice. We hypothesize that a comprehensive evaluation of
pre-analytical variables of biospecimen will lead to optimized bio-specimen procurement framework leading to
improved diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility in tissue and liquid biopsy setting and can be standardized in an
inter-CLIA lab setting for routine clinical practice/trials. This proposal aims to establish standardized, evidence-based
procedures on bio-specimen (RNA/DNA) processing, storage and transportation to ensure accurate, reproducible
assay performance. The identified conditions and parameters will be validated on prospective samples, preferably in a
clinical trial setting, so findings can be correlated with clinical data. Thus, three specific aims are proposed:
Specific Aim 1: To determine pre-analytical variables that affects the reliability of RNA-based assays in
FFPE tissue
Specific Aim 2: To identify pre-analytical factors affecting circulating tumor DNA (ct-DNA) detection and
quantification in patients with PTCL
Specific Aim 3: To validate harmonization of the pre-analytical variables in improving PTCL diagnostic or
prognostic assay in an inter-CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) lab setting
 The studies will lead to robust protocols that optimize the preservation biomolecules in tissue biopsies or plasma to
ensure accuracy and reproducibility of molecular assays, improving PTCL classification and prognostication."
10906847,"ABSTRACT
Aging is the single largest risk factor for many common diseases that burden public health. This is especially
true in the prostate. The prostate is a male sex accessory gland that is important in reproduction. However, as
men age the prostate undergoes a prototypical aging change, fibrosis. The aged fibrotic prostate causes
urinary symptoms which will afflict nearly every man if they live long enough. Our team has led an effort to
define the aged prostate and its associated urinary symptoms in overall health. To date aging mechanisms
have not been thoroughly tested or targeted for the nonmalignant prostate. Rather androgen regulated
pathways and alpha adrenergic activity have dominated the field. The long-term goal of this application is to
better understand how mitochondrial dysfunction and related molecular and cellular mechanisms promote
prostate aging and fibrosis, ultimately leading to prostate dysfunction, urinary symptoms and overall poor
health. Mitochondrial dysfunction has become an accepted mechanism of aging. However, the role of
mitochondrial dysfunction in the prostate has not been thoroughly tested. In part this is because there is little
understanding of the role of mitochondria in prostate function and no models have been identified to test it. To
better understand the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the aging prostate, we will perform 4 Aims. Aim 1 will
assess the gain of prostatic mitochondrial dysfunction using chemical inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I of
the electron transport chain and determine if prostatic aging is accelerated ultimately leading to a dysfunctional
prostate. Aim 2 will determine the molecular mechanism by which mitochondrial dysfunction induces aging and
fibrosis. Aim 3 identifies the localization of mitochondrial dysfunction in specific cells and anatomical areas of
the prostate of men, including differences in race as well as in the lower urinary tract of mice. Aim 4 tests the
effectiveness of pro-mitochondrial health drugs in reversing mitochondrial dysfunction, prostate aging, and
urinary dysfunction in human and mouse models of aging. Identifying pharmacological age related
interventions in novel prostate aging animal models to improve mitochondrial homeostasis would be highly
desirable towards the goal of prolonging healthspan. The potential translational impact of this approach is high,
as the proposed senolytics are already FDA approved and can be rapidly included into clinical trials. Upon the
completion of this work, we will better understand the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the aging prostate
and how to target this pathway for better urinary and overall health. Furthermore new aging models will be
developed and better characterized for future aging and urological related research."

A severe asthma endotype involving neutrophils infiltrating the airways with a Th17 dominant
milieu, and excessive airway remodeling and resistance to conventional therapies, has emerged
in patients in the past years. In a transcriptomic screen, we found that the TNF Superfamily
member LIGHT, was highly enriched in a murine model of severe asthma mimicking the human
disease, in addition to being enriched in the sputum of patients. This proposal will evaluate the
contribution of LIGHT signaling in 1) neutrophils to promote airway neutrophilia, 2) stromal cells
to promote pathological remodeling and steroid resistance, and 3) it will evaluate the pathogenic
role of Th17 cells as drivers of airway remodeling compared to Th2 cells, through LIGHT
production. Furthermore, we have evidence that the TNF Superfamily LIGHT decreases airway
remodeling and will address how LIGHT blockade compares to neutrophilic depletion, or IL17
neutralization, in decreasing NA symptoms: airway resistance, epithelial damage, fibroblasts
activation, and neutrophil recruitment. Lastly, this project will address whether the combinatorial
blockade of LIGHT and steroid treatment, can abrogate airway remodeling in severe asthma, in
the mouse model and the human lung-in-a-dish model we established."
10911930,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pediatric overweight and obesity continue to be major public health issues. Loss of control (LOC) eating and
overeating are two obesity-related phenotypes affecting ~30% of adolescents with overweight/obesity that may
undermine weight control treatment outcome. There are very few empirically-supported interventions targeting
these behaviors to promote weight regulation in adolescents. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has
promising effects on dysregulated eating, but effects on weight are often modest. Importantly, CBT fails to
adequately address developmental changes in self-regulation, which may limit CBT skill utilization in the
moments and contexts in which they are needed most. Moreover, CBT is costly, time intensive, and
inaccessible to most teens. Digital interventions overcome many of these barriers and hence may be an
optimal format for achieving engagement and scale, especially given the ubiquity of technology usage in
adolescents. Our group has tested the only digital CBT interventions targeting dysregulated eating and weight
in adolescents with overweight/obesity, and while effects on weight and LOC eating were promising, improved
design and updated delivery modes (i.e., Smartphone) are needed to strengthen engagement and clinical
outcomes. To achieve optimal engagement and efficacy, such interventions should be built around
developmentally appropriate theoretical models and informed by user needs and preferences. In the current
proposal, we will apply user-centered design methods to design and test a novel CBT-based digital
intervention, augmented with content and features to improve self-regulation, for weight gain prevention and
dysregulated eating in adolescents. The intervention will address behavioral, physiological, affective, and
environmental processes that impact eating and weight control, informed by self-regulation theories, and will
be guided by formative design work to ensure that content and features meet the needs of adolescents for
whom it is intended. The first phase will involve design activities with adolescents who have or are at risk for
overweight/obesity and report dysregulated eating, to understand desired packaging/presentation, features,
and barriers/facilitators to engagement. Research activities will include a needs assessment and iterative
prototyping, usability testing, and refinement of the digital intervention. The second phase will be a multisite
single arm open trial involving 50 adolescents who have or are at risk for overweight/obesity and report LOC
and/or overeating to investigate intervention feasibility and preliminary efficacy, as well as putative treatment
mechanisms and targets. Results of the study will directly inform design of a larger, adequately-powered
randomized controlled trial and will help advance scientific and clinical understanding of optimal treatment
strategies for adolescents with eating- and weight-related problems. Further, the project has clear potential to
significantly impact public health via development of a relevant, accessible, and scalable intervention for
adolescents at high risk for adult obesity and eating disorders, and related adverse health conditions."
10932914,"Under almost all conditions using any method, the levels of gene transfer to any cell or tissue are low because
many barriers exist for the efficient delivery of genes to cells. The primary goal of our laboratory is to identify
and overcome the intracellular barriers to promote effective gene delivery and therapy. Exogenous viral or non-
viral DNA must cross the plasma membrane, travel through the cytoplasm and the cytoskeletal networks, cross
the nuclear envelope, localize to specific regions within the nucleus, and be transcribed in order for gene
therapy to be successful. We have shown that once in the cytoplasm, plasmids carrying DNA nuclear targeting
sequences (DTS) that are required for nuclear import in non-dividing cells rapidly associate with transcription
factors that mediate movement along microtubules and across the nuclear envelope. NF-kB is one such factor
that binds to several ubiquitously active DTSs and is required for DNA nuclear import, but in the cytoplasm it is
maintained in a sequestered state, unable to bind DNA. The question then is how is NF-kB activated to bind to
plasmids and mediate their cytoskeletal movement and nuclear import? In the case of NF-kB, a major pathway
for its activation is through a set of cytoplasmic dsDNA sensors, such as cGAS-STING, that are part of the
innate immune system and drive inflammatory responses. When dsDNA binds to cGAS, signaling cascades
are initiated that result in activation of key pro-inflammatory transcription factors (including NF-kB) and
ultimately production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, a major focus in the gene therapy space has been
to block activation of these sensors to reduce inflammation. However, we have observed that when cGAS is
silenced, cytoplasmically injected plasmids fail to traffic to the nucleus. We hypothesize that limited activation
of one or more of these sensors is actually needed for low level activation of key transcription factors in order
to facilitate DNA nuclear import in non-dividing cells. If we can find ways to limit sensor activation, but not
abolish it, this will allow for enhanced gene delivery with limited accompanying inflammation. We have also
spent considerable effort detailing the distribution of plasmids inside the nucleus and have found that the
subnuclear mislocalization of plasmids can affect their transcriptional activity. We have found that plasmids
localize to discrete transcriptional domains within the nucleus based on the type of promoter (Pol I, Pol II, or
Pol III) they carry and that when two different promoter types are placed on one plasmid, not only is the
intranuclear distribution of the DNA different that either promoter type alone, but transgene expression is
significantly reduced. We will dissect the pathways used for DNA movement within the nucleus and exploit
them to improve transgene expression based on the subnuclear localization of the transfected DNA. Our
specific aims are to (1) determine whether cytosolic dsDNA sensors are required for DNA nuclear import; (2)
evaluate whether residence time of DNA in the cytoplasm affects sensor activation and transfection efficiency;
and (3) characterize how subnuclear organization affects exogenous DNA expression."

Overview: The ribonucleoprotein enzyme telomerase maintains telomere length homeostasis – a shared
hallmark between aging and carcinogenesis. Insufficient telomerase leads to telomere dysfunctions and
replicative senescence in stem cells, precipitating short-telomere diseases. Conversely, telomerase is exploited
by ~90% of cancers for growth immortality. Activating promoter mutations in the reverse transcriptase (TERT)
gene ranks the most frequent non-coding driver mutations. We have made contributions to an understanding of
how telomerase and telomere can be modulated. 1) we uncovered that TCAB1, a non-catalytic subunit of
telomerase and a Cajal body (CB) trafficking protein, functions as an activity switch during telomerase catalysis.
Using next-gen RNA structural profiling, we found that TCAB1-bound RNPs are endowed with an RNA
conformation favorable for TERT-TR engagement, linking an RNA quality-control with RNP trafficking and
catalysis; 2) we showed that the 5’ TR cap hypermethylation plays a negative role in telomerase RNA
accumulation and activity. We can induce robust telomere elongation by genetic inactivation and chemical
inhibition of the cap hypermethylase TGS1; 3) we also discovered a crosstalk between snRNA 5’ and 3’ PTM
critical for global splicing fidelity and motor neuron viability in multiple organisms. 4) we uncovered a Toxic
telomerase RNP that provokes acute and selective cancer genotoxicity at telomeres, unlike the conventional
delayed killing by direct telomerase inhibition.
Goals: We will test a model that RNP assembly and/or activity can be limited by phase-separated CB. We have
found that dismantlement of the RNA and protein components of CB both led to GOF of telomerase. We are
addressing: 1) Can CB contribute to the molecular determinant of telomere length set points? we are testing this
with a novel optogenetic pipeline to manipulate phase separation of a subset of cellular CBs and monitor a single
telomere elongation; 2) What is the RNA basis for telomerase phase separation at CB, at telomeres, or when
mislocalized to nucleoli? We will improve the current icSHAPE-seq to determine RNA structure at subcellular
locations; 3) We aim to elucidate the mechanism by which phase separation sequesters telomerase RNPs,
focusing on the dynamic interplay between TCAB1 and Coilin; 4) we aim to understand the genotoxic mechanism
underly the Toxic TERT. We also use this as a tractable system to identify suppressors as potential new factors
in RNP assembly and targeting.
Vision: we will engineer tools to study structure-function of RNP within phase-separated bodies. We will identify
additional telomerase-like RNPs that are similarly governed by phase-separation, RNA QC, and RNA PTMs. Our
long-term goal is to develop novel chemical matters that can boost telomerase to improve cell therapy, such as
making exhaustion-resistant CAR-T; we aim to further develop our bifunctional telomerase-targeting molecule
that induces rapid and selective cancer cytotoxicity into a pan-cancer drug."
10913518,"Abstract
Acute leukemia is an aggressive disease resulting from various genetic abnormalities and is characterized by
the presence of undifferentiated blood cells. Emerging evidence shows that recurrence of acute leukemia
results from the activity of leukemic stem cells (LSCs), which are resistant to chemotherapy, supporting the
need for new pharmacological agents inducing differentiation of LSCs. The self-renewal and differentiation
capacity of stem cells, including LSCs, are dependent on the activity of the Polycomb repressive complex 1
(PRC1). The core of all PRC1 complexes comprises heterodimeric complexes involving RING1B or RING1A
and one of the PCGF1-6 paralogs, which catalyze monubiquitination of histone H2A (H2Aub) constituting a
strong repressive mark. Simultaneous depletion of core PRC1 components RING1A/B results in a loss of
H2Aub deposition, cell growth arrest and differentiation of acute leukemia cells driven by the oncogenes
associated with expression of HOXA9. Therefore, blocking PRC1 activity with small molecules could lead to
eradication of LSCs and differentiation of leukemic blasts.
The major goal of this project is to develop potent small molecule inhibitors blocking the activity of PRC1 by a
direct inhibition of the RING1B-BMI1 E3 ubiquitin ligase to induce differentiation of leukemic cells. To this end,
we employed fragment-based screening followed by extensive medicinal chemistry to develop the first-in-class
small molecules that directly bind to the RING1A/B proteins and inhibit PRC1 activity through blocking the
interaction of the PRC1 complex with nucleosomes. Our first-generation inhibitor RB-3 decreases global level
of H2Aub and induces differentiation in leukemia cells and primary AML samples. The goal of this proposal is
to optimize this class of compounds and develop potent PRC1 inhibitors with optimized drug-like properties
and pronounced in vivo efficacy in animal models of acute leukemia. We will employ extensive medicinal
chemistry and structure-based design approach to optimize PRC1 inhibitors. All inhibitors will be characterized
to determine binding affinity, inhibitory activity, and cellular activity to inhibit H2Aub. Best compounds will be
extensively evaluated in a panel of leukemia cell lines. We will assess the mechanism of action of the PRC1
inhibitors and test their activity in the models of LSCs and in the primary AML patient samples. The optimized
compounds will be assessed in vivo for their potential to block development of leukemia in mouse models of
AML. Our studies will explore a new approach to induce differentiation of leukemia cells and LSCs and may
lead to the development of highly valuable chemical probe compounds or novel pharmacologic agents for
acute leukemia patients."
10901919,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In nature and human microbiomes, microbes regularly face challenges due to fluctuations in the availability of
resources and nutrients - a lifestyle termed feast/famine. Previous studies investigating microbial adaptation to
feast/famine have focused on the specific adaptations that allow microbes to survive extreme starvation, often
overlooking how the eventual replenishment of resources affects evolution. However, due to evolutionary
tradeoffs between growth and survival, the molecular, cellular, and behavioral phenotypes that evolve in
response to feast/famine may vary based on the duration and severity of starvation. Common adaptations to
resource limitation include expanding metabolic capability through nutritional competence and increasing
efficiency by diversification into cross-feeding ecotypes. As microbial metabolism can be constrained by many
biologically relevant factors, including the presence of oxygen, this can complicate evolution and limit potential
adaptive trajectories. Research in my lab focuses on how microbes adapt and diversify in novel complex
environments by applying multi-omic, systems microbiology approaches to experimental evolution. We plan to
investigate how oxygen availability shapes microbial evolution to feast/famine by conducting an adaptive
laboratory evolution experiment with two bacterial species, the facultative anaerobe Escherichia coli, and the
fastidious aerotolerant anaerobe Lactobacillus crispatus. We will characterize populations for fitness outcomes,
common adaptive mutations, and patterns of diversification to determine how oxygen influences adaptation to
feast/famine conditions. We will follow up by characterizing the effects of common adaptive mutations on
microbial physiology using transcriptomics and high-throughput phenotyping. Further, as oxygen can shift the
topography of the adaptive landscape by affecting the rate and spectra of mutations, we will also perform
mutation accumulation experiments on facultatively anaerobic, aerotolerant anaerobic, and obligately
anaerobic bacterial species in the presence and absence of oxygen. Studies of microbial evolution have
historically neglected fastidious microorganisms and anaerobic environments due to the challenges associated
with their culture. Our research will provide fundamental knowledge about evolutionary processes in a
neglected fraction of the microbial tree of life that accounts for a significant proportion of the human
microbiome."

 Mortality from out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a large public health burden, accounting for
approximately 10% of all deaths in the US. Because OHCA is a leading cause of mortality, advances in
resuscitation have the potential to improve public health. Currently resuscitation protocols use a one-size-fits-
all approach. However, we now understand that OHCA occurs via heterogeneous mechanisms and manifests
a time-dependent pathophysiology, which influences prognosis. The heterogeneity suggests discrete clinical
phenotypes and an opportunity for individualized therapy. Distinguishing information about patient physiology
can be harnessed from the defibrillator. Continuous bio-measures of ECG, end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2),
and transthoracic impedance (TI) can determine physiologic status and potentially guide optimal treatment.
 However, a real-time continuous approach to characterize a patient’s physiology and prognosis by
accurately determining the underlying rhythm and its vitality is not presently feasible without repeatedly
interrupting CPR. CPR interruption is required because chest compressions introduce ECG artifact that
prevents rhythm identification, prognostic assessment of rhythm morphology, and a patient’s underlying vital
status (vitality). However, CPR interruption is harmful since it disrupts perfusion in the otherwise pulseless
OHCA victim. Consequently, the current protocol is a compromise: CPR is interrupted every 2 minutes to help
inform care decisions though treatment proceeds empirically as CPR resumes and providers are typically
“blinded” to the actual underlying rhythm and vital status.
 Emerging evidence from the proposal team highlight the ability to use signal processing techniques to
investigate the ECG, ETCO2, and TI defibrillator signals during CPR to improve OHCA resuscitation. These
investigations use artificial intelligence (AI) methods to determine a patient’s instantaneous physiological status
and predict downstream resuscitation outcomes. We propose an investigative plan that will:
1. Derive and validate an integrated ventricular fibrillation (VF) OHCA algorithm that incorporates and builds
upon previously-validated modular algorithms, using artificial intelligence (AI) methods that process and
integrate ECG, TI, and ETCO2 bio-signals during active CPR.
2. Prospectively evaluate the integrated algorithms and their validated building block components in distinct
adult and pediatric OHCA populations.
3. Conduct a simulated randomized trial among EMS to compare the described precision strategy to the
current-day, fixed protocol to understand how dynamic prompts of a precision strategy affect CPR metrics.
 The project leverages an unparalleled data resource and a tested, multidisciplinary team with a track-record
of impactful resuscitation investigations involving novel approaches to AI and resuscitation. This consequent
precision strategy ultimately could transform resuscitation and improve public health."

Anotia/microtia is a birth defect characterized by an absent or hypoplastic external ear; it is estimated that
>80,000 Americans are living with this condition, which causes significant hearing loss in >75% of affected
individuals. This study will identify social/environmental and genetic drivers of anotia/microtia, with an
emphasis on addressing health disparities for Hispanic/Latinx populations. Notably, the birth prevalence of
anotia/microtia is increased in Hispanic relative to non-Hispanic white populations, but Hispanic infants are less
likely to be diagnosed with an anotia/microtia syndrome than their non-Hispanic white peers. This study will
use a three-part approach. First, by leveraging data on >10 million live births and >3,500 cases with
anotia/microtia from population-based birth defects registries in California and Texas, it will evaluate the extent
to which sociodemographic factors explain differences in the birth prevalence of anotia/microtia syndromes
between Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations. Second, using an ancestry-aware genome-wide association
method (Tractor), archived biospecimens from the California Biobank Program and National Birth Defects
Prevention Study, and publicly available whole-genome sequencing data from the Gabriella Miller Kids First
Pediatric Research Initiative, it will identify genetic variants associated with anotia/microtia in Hispanic and
non-Hispanic individuals. Next, it will apply a rigorous machine learning technique to data from the National
Birth Defects Prevention Study (N=699 cases with anotia/microtia and >10,000 controls without birth defects)
to identify maternal exposures associated with anotia/microtia in Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations.
Finally, it will perform an integrative assessment of the role of sociodemographic, genetic, and maternal factors
in determining risk for anotia/microtia. In accomplishing these objectives, the study will: identify drivers of
disparities in anotia/microtia among Hispanic populations; shed light on the etiology of anotia/microtia in
diverse populations by characterizing genetic variants associated with this disease, which will be targets for
future investigation; and identify potentially modifiable maternal exposures that could be used to facilitate
prevention."

Small RNAs are ubiquitous regulators of eukaryotic gene expression in nearly all aspects of physiology
from plants to humans. They function to regulate all facets of gene expression including transcription,
RNA stability, and translation. An emerging class of small regulatory RNAs are tRNA-fragments (tRFs),
produced from nucleolytic cleavage of tRNAs. tRFs have been implicated in cancer, neurodegenerative
disease, viral infection, fertility, epigenetic inheritance, and aging. While the biogenesis of these RNAs is
poorly understood, tRFs have been demonstrated to play roles in the regulation of transcription,
posttranscriptional regulation of mRNA stability, and translation. Yet, the functions of tRFs throughout the
different tissues of an organism in regulating cellular physiology are unknown.
 My lab is developing the roundworm C. elegans (worms) as a model to dissect the molecular
mechanisms underlying the biogenesis tRF and cellular functions throughout the animal. The robust
genetics, physiological assays, and molecular tools available in C. elegans provide a system ripe for the
discovery of tRF biology. Importantly, we have developed small RNA-sequencing techniques to detect
abundant tRFs in C. elegans, at levels much higher than previously published small RNA-seq datasets.
Using these techniques, we will characterize tRFs in the different tissues of the fully developed adult
using bulk and single-cell small RNA-seq. After determining the spatial and temporal expression of tRF
species we will utilize both forward and reverse genetics to determine new factors required for their
biogenesis. Further, we will employ biochemical enrichment strategies to determine factors that interact
with and affect tRF function. Upon determining genes required for tRF biogenesis and function we will
use mutant alleles of these factors to determine what roles these molecules have in regulating the
physiology of the organism. Finally, we will use worm strains carrying loss-of-function mutations in RNA
modifying enzymes to determine how RNA modifications affect tRF biogenesis, functions, and further
regulate the physiology of the animal. The work on tRFs in C. elegans in my lab represents the first
systematic dissections of all aspects of tRFs biology in a whole organism. What we learn about tRF
biology in worms will be used to generate hypotheses about tRFs in other organisms. As tRFs have been
implicated in many aspects of normal physiology in organisms ranging from yeast to humans, as well as
in a wide range of diseases, comprehensively understanding how tRF are regulated and function
represents a highly under-addressed aspect of biology."

ROCKY MOUNTAIN CANNABIS RESEARCH CENTER (RM-CRC)
The United States has recently experienced enormous changes in the legal status and public acceptance of
cannabis. Recreational and medical cannabis products that contain varying amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are now widely available throughout North America. Despite these changes,
research on the effects of THC and CBD has been lacking. The central goals of this Research Center of
Excellence application are to evaluate, in three research projects that span emerging, middle-aged, and older
adults, how CBD affects the use of and subjective response to THC, and whether these effects are mediated by
the endocannabinoid system (ECS) and associated lipids. To that end, the three research projects within the
RM-CRC utilize research strategies that capitalize on three key innovations. First, the projects will employ mobile
pharmacology laboratories to collect biological samples and assess the acute effects of THC and CBD on key
neurocognitive and behavioral outcomes, endocannabinoids, and other lipids that interact with the ECS. Second,
under the auspices of an FDA IND we hold for hemp-derived CBD, projects will randomly assign participants to
CBD or placebo and will parametrically manipulate either the dose of CBD or whether the CBD product contains
THC, to determine how hemp-derived CBD products may impact the effects of THC. Finally, the projects rely on
newly designed assays within our Cannabis Research Analytics Core (CRAC) to measure cannabinoids,
metabolites, terpenes, endocannabinoids, and other lipid mediators in blood samples. The Data Harmonization
and Analysis Core (DHAC) will deploy a single-solution system to support data collection, harmonization across
projects, and sharing of the data with the larger scientific community directly and via NIH approved repositories.
The DHAC will also harmonize previously collected data (from 7 R01s, n=1359) and conduct advanced machine
learning analyses of the relationships between THC and CBD blood levels, endocannabinoids and other lipid
mediators, and behavioral data. The results will inform center-wide analyses of the harmonized P50 project data.
Thus, the CRAC and DHAC provide the RM-CRC with significant added value that will allow the Center to
generate significant new knowledge with respect to how changes in the ECS and related lipids mediate the
effects of THC and CBD across the lifespan. The RM-CRC is expected to be a significant resource to the field
more broadly by providing other scientists access to data regarding CBD effects on psychiatric and health
outcomes, cannabinoid, metabolite, and terpene blood levels, and 100+ endocannabinoids and related lipid
mediators in approximately 2000 participants."
10912673,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The central question for the Rocky Mountain Cannabis Research Center (RM-CRC) is the extent to which the
health effects of cannabis products are influenced by the amount or ratio of THC and CBD and how these
effects are mediated by the endocannabinoid system (ECS) and associated lipids. To that end, the RM-CRC
will implement three research Projects, two analytic Cores (Cannabis Research Analytics - CRAC, Data
Harmonization and Analysis - DHAC), and two support Cores (Administrative, Pilot Project). The first Aim of
the Administrative Core is to ensure the efficient and effective administration of the overall Center. To that
end, the Core will oversee the day-to-day financial, personnel, and regulatory activities of the RM-CRC and its
Projects and Cores and ensure that communication between Study Investigators and Core Directors, and
utilization of RM-CRC resources occur in a manner that promotes the highest level of productivity. The Core
will also establish and oversee an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC) and External Advisory Committee (EAC)
to evaluate progress and results, recommend changes, and suggest future directions. The second Aim is to
establish diversity, equity, and inclusion within the RM-CRC. The University of Colorado School of Medicine
and Department of Psychiatry have pledged matching funds of $1,050,000 to assist with this Aim. Finally, the
third Aim of the Core is to establish the RM-CRC as a national resource with an interface to facilitate outreach,
and education. To that end the Core will work with the DHAC to develop and manage an appropriate data
sharing action plan and to interact with investigators outside the RM-CRC who may wish to access RM-
CRC data. The Administrative Core will also field queries regarding other types of affiliations with the RM-
CRC and/or requests to utilize the services of the CRAC as a national resource. Finally, the Core will develop,
implement and manage all RM-CRC retreats, seminars, and other RM-CRC education/outreach activities."

During Plasmodium parasite liver stage infection, parasites protect their host hepatocyte by preventing its
death and exploiting host resources for growth and development. This process is imperfect, as some parasites
succumb to host defenses and are eliminated by host cell death; this, in turn, elicits an immune response. This
proposal is focused on the investigation of molecular mechanisms in the hepatocyte that curtail, or promote,
malaria parasite infection and the immunological consequences of those outcomes. After transmission by a
mosquito, Plasmodium parasites are carried by the blood stream to the liver and invade a single hepatocyte to
form a liver stage. Throughout the liver stage we have shown that both apoptosis and lipid peroxide mediated
death pathways curtail infection. Whether the infected cell survives or succumbs to host cell death has
consequences that expand beyond the individual infection; parasites that are eliminated via hepatocyte cell
death can provide potent stimuli for the subsequent immune response and the nature of the immune
stimulation is partially dependent on the type of regulated cell death engaged. Indeed, we show that immune
cell subsets, in particular immune cells with markers consistent with tolerogenic macrophages, sequester
around the parasite during liver infection. Additionally, eliminating apoptosis, a sterile form of cell death,
reduces immunity in response to whole parasite vaccination. This proposal aims to test the hypothesis that
multiple forms of cell death can control Plasmodium infection and that altering the balance between sterile and
inflammatory forms of cell death impacts subsequent immunity to parasite infection. To test this hypothesis, we
will make extensive use of animal and technological tools. First, we will use mice with cell death pathways
eliminated exclusively in hepatocytes to examine the specific role of each type of cell death in regulating wild
type parasites and parasites with multiple biological deficiencies. We will use genome wide CRISPR/Cas9
screens to identify specific genetic regulators of cell death in infected cells and we will make use of a mosquito
dissection robot that we have recently designed, built, and tested to perform larger, more unbiased analyses
than previously possible. We will also take advantage of state-of-the-art spatial profiling approaches that
facilitate the collection of proteomic and transcriptomic information in situ for Plasmodium-infected livers to
examine infected cells, and the surrounding immune environment. In addition to identifying mediators of initial
infection, will use these tools to ask how altered hepatocyte death primes CD8 T cell responses and informs
immunity to subsequent infection. Accomplishing our aims enables altering key host factors with small-
molecules that could prevent a wild-type parasite from progressing to symptomatic erythrocytic infection or
eliminate infection in a way that elicits a potent immune response against subsequent challenge."

Axon regeneration after peripheral nerve (PN) injury is often incomplete. There is currently no effective
treatment beyond surgical reconstruction, which is only beneficial for a small percentage of cases.
Understanding the repair mechanisms is thus crucial. Here, we investigate a previously unknown function of
the core circadian regulator Bmal1 in gating neuroregenerative responses after PN injury. The study is based
on our new data that neuron-specific deletion of Bmal1 accelerates axon regeneration after PN injury. This
exciting finding was made in the context of a series of advances from our laboratory in deciphering
transcriptional networks that control neuronal intrinsic axon growth potential, i.e., how transcription factors
(TFs) cooperate with epigenetic factors to reshape the chromatin landscape for induction of regeneration-
associated genes (RAGs). Our most recent work has leveraged our genome-wide mapping of DNA
hydroxymethylation (5hmC) dynamics in regenerating dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. Intriguingly, we
discovered enrichment of the Bmal1 binding motifs in genomic loci displaying 5hmC changes after PN injury,
suggesting an interaction of Bmal1 with the 5mC/5hmC converting enzyme Tet3. Indeed, Bmal1 cKO in mice
showed that the Bmal1-Tet3-5hmC axis regulates genes linked to axon growth, metabolism, and immune
interactions. Moreover, pilot data show for the first-time a diurnal epigenetic rhythm of Tet3 and 5hmC in DRG
neurons that is anti-phasic to Bmal1 transcriptional oscillation and corresponds to time-of-day differences in
regenerative responses. Here, we will test the central hypothesis that Bmal1 functions as an inhibitor of axon
regeneration and a gatekeeper of injury-trigged immune activation via regulation of 5hmC reprogramming. In
Aim 1, we will characterize Bmal1-gated regenerative gene programs and examine the effect of
pharmacological inhibition of Bmal1 transcription by SR9009, a potent Rev-Erb agonist with CNS penetration
capability. Mechanistically, we will test a “two-hit model” wherein Bmal1 deletion primes DRG neurons, but an
injury signal is required for RAGs induction. In Aim 2, we will characterize Tet3/5hmC epigenetic rhythmicity,
correlation with “neurite outgrowth clock”, and the underlying mechanisms by testing the working model that
Bmal1 controls Tet3 expression as well as Tet3 recruitment to target loci for 5hmC reprogramming. We will
then map short- and long-term impact of PN injury on Bmal1-Tet3-5hmC rhythmicity and whether these
rhythms return to normal upon axonal reconnection. In Aim 3, we pivot to in vivo study of the promoting effect
of Bmal1 inhibition on nerve repair, including motosensory functions. We will also address sustainability of the
effect, sex differences, and timed Bmal1 inhibition shortly after PN injury. In sum, our proposal has the
potential of connecting Bmal1 circadian pathway, Tet3/5hmC epigenetic reprogramming, injury-triggered
immune responses, and axon regeneration, thus advancing basic science of nerve regeneration and opening
translational paths."

Microglia are the resident immune cells of the Central Nervous System (CNS). They are positioned at the center of
brain development and function by playing crucial roles in neuronal network architecture and homeostatic surveillance.
Unlike other CNS-resident cells, microglia originate outside the brain, specifically in the embryonic yolk sac (YS).
Before microglia can serve their crucial functions, they must first migrate to and infiltrate the developing brain. The
cellular and molecular dynamics governing this process are not fully understood, and what we do know is based on YS-
derived microglia. However, cre/lox fate mapping studies only map ~30% of all mouse microglia to the YS. This
suggests additional sources and populations of microglia could exist. This has been confirmed in zebrafish, where
microglia have additional, non-YS origins. The discovery of additional microglia populations leaves us with even less
understanding of how microglial precursors seed the brain, especially given that what we do know is from YS-derived
microglia only. To begin to fill this critical gap, we investigated the microglia that seed the embryonic brain. Because
microglia seeding the brain is a highly dynamic process, we utilized timelapse imaging in zebrafish to watch the cells
live. We identified an undescribed cell in the brain that expresses canonical microglia markers, clears debris, and
expands in injury. These microglia-like cells are labeled with Mannose Receptor C, type 1a (mrc1a) and colonize the
brain earlier than known microglia precursors. mrc1a+ microglia are dependent on the mrc1a+ lymphatic vessels sitting
just outside the CNS boundary. These mrc1a+ cells are located within the brain parenchyma and do not associate with
vessels or the brain-border, suggesting they’re not macrophages, perivascular cells, or brain lymphatic endothelial
cells. Despite our discovery of this early-infiltrating population, the dynamics of how this mrc1a+ population colonizes
the brain and expands as microglia are unknown. The implication of mrc1a+ brain-border lymphatics in these processes
is also undetermined. The goal of the proposed study is to investigate the cellular and molecular characteristics
of a novel, mrc1a+ microglia subpopulation as it colonizes, expands, and differentiates in the developing brain. I
will accomplish this by using a combination of in vivo imagine, optogenetic tools, and photoactivatable drugs to carry
out the following aims: 1. Determine if brain-border lymphatic vessels contribute microglial progenitors to the
developing brain. 2. Characterize the molecular profile of mrc1a+ cells as they differentiate into microglia. This work
has the potential to impact a broad spectrum of fields including basic neurodevelopmental biology, neurodevelopmental
disorder and disease, glial biology, and CNS homeostasis by investigating the fundamental dynamics behind early
microglial precursors as they infiltrate the developing brain, expand, and turn on canonical microglia markers."
10802375,"Mechanisms of Epigenetic Plasticity in Neuropathic Pain
The major objective of our project is to determine how traumatic nerve injury impacts epigenetic regulatory
networks involved in chronic pain. Neuropathic pain remains a major clinical problem and therapeutic challenge.
Both sustained changes in gene expression in primary afferent neurons and synaptic plasticity at the spinal cord
level are essential for to the development of chronic pain. α2δ-1 (encoded by the Cacna2d1 gene) is a
clinically validated neuropathic pain target and mediates the therapeutic actions of gabapentinoids.
Traumatic nerve injury and certain cancer chemotherapeutic drugs cause α2δ-1 upregulation in the dorsal root
ganglion and spinal cord, which augments nociceptive input to spinal dorsal horn neurons by directly interacting
with NMDA receptors. Yet we know almost nothing about how nerve injury initiates and sustains the high
expression level of α2δ-1. Acetylation of lysine residues in histone tails is dynamically regulated by various
histone deacetylases (HDACs). However, the specific HDAC subtypes responsible for the upregulation of α2δ-
1 and other neuroplasticity-related genes in neuropathic pain have not been rigorously studied or identified. To
address this key knowledge gap, we will specifically determine the role of class I HDAC subtypes in the control
of histone acetylation and expression of α2δ-1 and other gene targets implicated in synaptic plasticity in two
neuropathic pain models. On the basis of our preliminary data, we propose to test the overall hypothesis that
nerve injury and chemotherapy diminish HDAC2 occupancy to induce histone hyperacetylation, via CK2-
mediated phosphorylation, at the promoters of Cacna2d1 and other neuroplasticity-related genes in the DRG
and that HDAC2 constitutively restrains chronic pain by repressing Cacna2d1 transcription and α2δ-1–
dependent NMDA receptor activation at the spinal cord level. We will apply several innovative and vigorous
approaches, including unbiased genome-wide epigenetic analyses, transgenic mice, and synaptic recordings to
study neuroplasticity at molecular, cellular, and behavioral levels. Our project will generate fundamental new
information about the epigenetic basis of neuropathic pain. Findings from our project are expected to advance
our knowledge of molecular mechanisms of epigenetic plasticity and to guide the development of new strategies
for treating neuropathic pain."
10907466,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Bisphenols (BPs) are commonly used plasticizers that are present in many plastics, such as food storage
containers and reusable water bottles, as well as lining of food cans. BP exposure via oral consumption is
ubiquitous in human populations with inter-individual variation in the levels of exposure. Prenatal exposure to
BPs has been associated with negative neurodevelopmental and behavior outcomes for children in human
epidemiological studies as well as in rodent models of prenatal BP exposure.
BPs such as BPA and other “BPA-free” structural analogs, including BPF and BPS, have been shown to act as
endocrine disruptors that primarily affect estrogen receptor signaling. Previous studies demonstrate that BPs
can bind to both estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and estrogen receptor beta to exert effects on gene
transcription. Studies using animal models and human placental tissue have demonstrated that BPs can cross
the placenta and exert effects directly on the fetus. Maternal BPs may also disrupt estrogen-dependent
changes in the maternal brain which impairs postnatal maternal care.
Both prenatal BP exposure and altered maternal care are associated with changes in DNA methylation levels
across the genome which can lead to stable changes in transcript abundance of affected genes. However, the
underlying mechanisms linking prenatal BP exposure and DNA methylation modifications at specific loci are
not well-known. In addition, the relative effects of altered postnatal maternal care on offspring with prenatal BP
exposure has been understudied.
The primary objective of my proposed research is to examine the effects of prenatal BP exposure on DNA
methylation modifications at specific loci, notably estrogen responsive elements (EREs), and corresponding
changes in gene transcription in the neonatal rat brain. In addition, I will explore a potentially effective
intervention, maternal licking-like tactile stimulation, to mitigate the effects of prenatal BP on DNA methylation
proximal to EREs in the neonatal rat brain. I hypothesize that DNA methylation changes in response to
increased prenatal BP exposure will be enriched in proximity to EREs in the neonatal rat brain and correspond
to differences in transcript abundance of estrogen-responsive genes. In addition, I hypothesize that postnatal
maternal licking-like stimulation would partially reverse the effects of prenatal BP exposure on DNA
methylation modifications proximal to EREs in the neonatal rat brain via increased ERα binding at EREs.
Training Potential: In tandem with my proposed research project, I will be developing important research
competencies in the developmental origins of health and disease conceptual framework, translational
research, and bioinformatic analyses of multi-omics datasets. Following these training experiences, I aim to be
competitive for an independent research position and successfully transition to research independence."

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer’s disease,
affecting 1-2% of the population over the age of 65. With our aging population, it is anticipated that the burden on
our society will significantly escalate. Currently, there are no treatments that can halt or reverse the progression
of PD. Because the loss of a specific cell type, midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons in the substantia nigra, is the
main cause of motor dysfunction in PD, it is a promising target for cell-based therapy. Indeed, numerous studies
have demonstrated the proof-of-principle that cell transplantation is a viable therapeutic regimen for PD once
unlimited, functional, and safe cell sources can be established from different individuals with varying genetic
backgrounds. Among various potential cell sources, patient-derived human induced pluripotent stem cells
(hiPSCs) represent a promising cell source and may permit personalized cell therapy without ethical or medical
issues such as immunosuppression required for allogeneic cell transplantation. Toward this long-term goal,
during the last decade, we have uncovered a novel molecular pathway underlying metabolic reprogramming,
identified specifically involved microRNAs, developed a chemical method to eliminate remaining undifferentiated
cells with tumorigenic potential, established novel reprogramming methods to generate clinical grade iPSCs and
in vitro differentiation methods to generate healthier mDA cells, and improved neurosurgical methods to increase
the graft survival, leading to the first autologous cell therapy for a sporadic PD patient. At the same time, our
progress revealed several fundamental and practical challenges that must be addressed to realize fully the
potential of hiPSC-based autologous cell therapy for PD, including further development of more robust and safer
reprogramming and in vitro differentiation methods based on molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic
reprogramming during cell fate regulation. We propose to address these fundamental and practical issues of
patient-specific cell therapy and to establish a platform that will enable personalized cell therapy for PD patients
regardless of their genetic backgrounds."

Depression, anxiety, and trauma are common mental disorders that disproportionately affect adolescents and
youth with HIV (AYHIV), and are associated with antiretroviral treatment (ART) non-adherence and poor
treatment outcomes. The integration of mental health services in HIV care for AYHIV is recommended, but is
lacking due to few trained mental health providers, and lack of a well validated integration models.
Transdiagnostic interventions based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and delivered by lay health workers
are effective in addressing these mental health conditions and could potentially improve HIV treatment outcomes.
Barriers to integration of these interventions in the care of AYHIV in sub-Saharan Africa include paucity of
effectiveness data among AYHIV and the lack of adaptation to tailor implementation for the HIV care context,
including the length of treatment (number and frequency of sessions) and the format of delivery. This proposal
builds on the successful pilot of Psychoeducation, Relaxation, PrOblem solving, Activation, Cognitive coping
(PRO-ACT), a brief, modular and transdiagnostic intervention for adolescents and youth with mild to
moderate symptoms of depression and anxiety in Kenya that resulted in clinically significant reduction in
symptoms. The intervention can be delivered in stand-alone modules either in person or by phone, making it
particularly appropriate for AYHIV when school is in session. In this project, we propose to further adapt PRO-
ACT for the HIV care setting through a stakeholder engagement process with policymakers, mental health and
adolescent HIV practitioners, and AYHIV. To prepare for the execution of trial, the stakeholders will identify and
prioritize potential barriers to implementation and suggest adaptations to the implementation process that
address key barriers. A pilot study at an HIV clinic with 10 providers and 20 AYHIV with mild to moderate
symptoms will enable the study team to further adapt the intervention and study procedures. Using a hybrid 1
cluster randomized trial in 30 HIV clinics in Kenya, we will assess the effectiveness of PRO-ACT in reducing
depressive, anxiety and trauma symptoms 6 months and 12 months after enrolment, comparing 300 AYHIV with
mild to moderate symptoms in intervention to 300 in control clinics. To inform the integration of the intervention
in routine care, we will measure implementation outcomes including reach, fidelity and maintenance, and explore
multilevel determinants influencing reach, fidelity and maintenance in mental health screening and management,
acceptability of training by providers and satisfaction with services by AYHIV. We will also conduct an economic
evaluation through a time-driven activity- activities within the
30 clinics in participating in the study to estimate the implementation costs from a patient and health system

10800814,"The purpose of the HIV and Substance Use Cohort Coordinating Center for Emerging and High Impact
Scientific Cross Cohort Studies: HIV SUCCESS is to support National Institute on Drug Abuse funded cohorts
as they implement research strategies to better understand and address substance use and its consequences
among people with HIV (PWH). Substance use prevalence among PWH is high, and substance use patterns,
including increasing concurrent methamphetamine/opioid use as part of the 4th wave of the opioid epidemic,
continue to evolve. Substantial challenges remain to improve understanding and implementation of
interventions to address substance use and its impacts among PWH. Addressing these challenges is the
overarching purpose of the cohorts and requires a coordinating center (CC) experienced in data integration
and harmonization, health informatics, multi-site coordination, clinical care and intervention experience, and
HIV and substance use research to support the cohorts and comprehensively integrate cross-cohort data. The
resulting resource of comprehensively integrated data will give researchers the potential to address important
scientific and public health questions that would otherwise not be possible in individual cohorts. We will work
with cohorts to allow complex, careful and complete analyses of outcomes and results across diverse
populations using harmonized data. We will bring in data from other cohorts and studies as needed to ensure
that adequate clinical, biomarker, and/or genetic data are available to address key questions. Careful data
harmonization where appropriate will improve the statistical power to identify areas or sub-groups for research
focus and to understand what interventions are proving successful in the broader context of the whole
population of PWH (as opposed to the target population of a single cohort). This team brings vast experience
with HIV cohort data; data linkage and harmonization; methods development; statistical support including
causal inference from longitudinal observational data; health informatics platform and tool infrastructure and
development including data repositories and tools for efficient and accurate electronically collected patient
reported outcomes and outcomes adjudication; providing overall coordination for large collaborations of
cohorts and studies; a strong background in clinical epidemiology of HIV and substance use; and expertise in
applying this information to clinical care and interventions. We also have a comprehensive mentoring approach
to develop a new generation of HIV and substance use researchers. We will support cohorts to enhance data
collection where appropriate, merge and harmonize data when feasible, and work together to address key
questions on HIV, substance use, and outcomes that cannot be addressed by individual cohorts. By providing
project management, mentorship, and support, as well as developing a robust data repository, and
accomplishing the integration and linkage of data, we will achieve a multi-disciplinary integrated network with
multi-site data with sufficient sizes needed to address substance use and its impacts among PWH."

 The actin cytoskeleton and its dynamic regulation play an essential role in
neuronal development and function. The proposed study aims to investigate the role of
Fascin, a family of actin bundling proteins, in brain development and function. Fascin1
exhibits an intriguing expression profile in mammalian brains: it is highly expressed
during development but the expression is substantially decreased in the adult brain
During development, elongating axons are guided to their specific targets for synaptic
connections. Axon pathfinding depends on the motile growth cone at the tip of
developing axons, which senses and responds to a variety of extracellular signals to
navigate through a complex and changing environment. The first part of the proposed
study aims to test the hypothesis that fascin, a family of actin filament bundling proteins,
functions in the formation and dynamic regulation of growth cone filopodia during axon
guidance. The part of research will take advantage of our expertise in growth cone
research, and employment of a multifaceted approach involving imaging, molecular
manipulation, and combined assays in cell cultures and ex vivo brain tissues.
 While fascin1 expression is substantially reduced in adult brains, fascin1 remains
highly expressed in adult hippocampus. We will test the exciting hypothesis that fascin1
plays an important role in the formation, maintenance, and remodeling of mossy fiber-
CA3 synaptic connections. Using a combination of an in vivo labeling and manipulation,
imaging, and electrophysiology, we aim to evaluate and establish, for the first time, the
role of fascin1 and its actin bundling in brain development and synaptic regulation in
adult brain. Given that elevated fascin1 levels have been associated with cancer cell
metastasis, the proposed work on fascin1 will not only provide significant insights into
the molecular mechanisms of brain development and function, but also extend our
knowledge concerning the actin mechanisms underlying directed cell movement in many
physiological and pathological events."

CD8+ T cells' unique ability to sense and kill pathogen-infected and tumor cells makes developing human
vaccines designed to induce potent CD8+ T cell memory an important necessity. In this proposal, we explore the
roles of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and peptide/MHC (pMHC) stability on generating memory CD8+ T cells.
Strong cognate antigen interactions induce robust primary effector responses and generate larger pools of
memory CD8+ T cells. However, whether the quality of TCR signaling and pMHC interactions can imprint distinct
CD8+ T cell memory programs is not well known. Prior studies state that differences in antigen stimulation do
not lead to functional differences, but our preliminary data suggest that the strength and the stability of pMHC
and TCR interactions do imprint functionally distinct cellular programs in resulting memory CD8+ T cells. Using
high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry, transgenic TCR and fluorescent reporter mouse models, and an
inducible lentiviral-based T cell gene editing approach, we will determine whether model epitopes with distinct
TCR signaling qualities can imprint distinct memory cell programs. In addition, we will characterize a subset of
memory CD8+ T cells that we propose are precursors to long-lived memory and test whether these cells confer
improved pathogen-specific protection. I am confident that I will successfully execute the proposed research and
training plans under the mentorship of Dr. Gregoire Lauvau with the support of our collaborators, Drs. Wenjun
Guo and Fabien Delahaye, experts in stem cell transduction and computational genomics, respectively. Findings
from our proposed study will contribute to a better understanding of memory CD8+ T cell formation and improve

changes in gene expression that recapitulate changes seen in depression patients examined postmortem.
Importantly, this paradigm allows for the distinction of animals that succumb to the effects of the stress, termed
susceptible, from those that do not, termed resilient. Previously published work has identified a gene network in
the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) that is specific to resilient mice. In this proposal, I will establish a reproducible
pipeline to characterize the regulatory dynamics of resilient-specific gene networks in order to better understand
the transcriptional circuitry that exist within these networks. I will then activate these transcriptional circuits in
stress-naïve mice before subjecting them to CSDS to test their influence on resilience. The proposed research
will provide a framework to study the transcriptional mechanism(s) of resilience by providing mechanistic insight
into the transcriptional circuitry regulating stress resilience in mice. Together these aims will, for the first time,
establish a novel experimental approach for studying the control over resilience by a complex network of genes
as opposed to standard approaches which interrogate one gene at a time. This approach is designed to be
applicable to any brain region, animal model, or network-based bioinformatics approach."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex disease that arises from a combination of genetic and environmental
factors. Previous genome wide association studies (GWAS) of T2D have identified over 600 independent
genetic signals, but most fall within non-coding regions of the genome, which makes identifying underlying
mechanisms difficult. These signals can be cell-type specific, which adds another layer of complexity to
nominating mechanisms. Recent work within the lab has identified skeletal muscle cell-type specific genetic
regulators by investigating single-nucleus resolution chromatin structure across hundreds of samples. We
observed several T2D GWAS signals colocalize specifically with mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) genetic
regulators of chromatin structure, which represents a precursor cell stage that may reflect an early indicator of
disease predisposition. Previous work within the lab has identified an ARL15 intronic T2D GWAS signal that is
specific to MSCs. Chromatin looping analyses showed that this genetic regulatory region interacts with the
follistatin (FST) promoter ~500kb away. The protein follistatin promotes muscle growth and affects insulin
resistance by binding activin A and preventing it from inhibiting the mTOR pathway. Up-regulation of the FST
pathway has been linked to increased T2D risk and impacts adipocyte differentiation. Follistatin is responsive
to environmental stimulation, including inflammation, insulin, and glucose levels. These observations provide
strong evidence that exploring the stimulatory state specific genetics of MSC chromatin structure, especially at
FST and related pathway genes, will have implications for T2D. As a result, I am interested in studying the
state-specific contexts which may influence T2D predisposition in MSCs, especially the state-specific genetic
regulatory landscape of FST. Previous studies have shown that cellular state influences the genetic regulation
of gene expression, where cells in a basal state display a “primed” chromatin conformation at response-
specific differentially regulated genes. This primed state reflected a basal chromatin configuration that enabled
the response-specific gene expression change. Therefore, the genetic signals of gene regulation vary across
cell states within a cell type. To begin to investigate this within T2D, I will generate MSCs, induce different
stimulatory states, and generate gene expression and chromatin structure data to establish genome-wide
maps of FST pathway genes. Finally, I will investigate the FST gene pathway and select loci for validation with
a novel inducible CRISPRi/a platform. Overall, I will generate MSC maps in different stimulatory states and use
a multi-omics approach to compare the genetic control of gene expression and chromatin structure, focusing
on the gene FST and related pathway genes, with the goal of nominating mechanisms at T2D GWAS signals."

Over 200 million courses of antibiotics were prescribed in the U.S. in 2020, raising a significant clinical concern
as antibiotic courses of two weeks or longer result in hematological complications, the most serious of which is
neutropenia. Neutropenia, if left untreated, is a risk factor for subsequent infections, sepsis, and death.
Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of antibiotic-associated bone marrow suppression will allow us to develop
therapies to prevent or treat bone marrow suppression in patients who require prolonged antibiotics.
 Our lab has developed a mouse model of antibiotic-associated bone marrow suppression that showed
that depletion of the microbiome on prolonged antibiotics results in anemia, leukopenia, and other cytopenias.
However, the precise stage in differentiation at which antibiotics disrupt hematopoiesis remains unknown. We
further demonstrated that the microbiome promotes a basal level of type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling, which is
required to maintain steady-state hematopoiesis in a STAT1-dependent manner. Although prior studies showed
that activation of NOD1 and TLR-MYD88 pathways can support myelopoiesis, I observed normal numbers of
hematopoietic progenitors and granulocytes at baseline in Nod1 and Myd88-deficient mice, suggesting that these
pathways are dispensable for normal blood production. Several independent studies have shown that the
microbiome can induce tonic IFN-I signaling through TLR-TRIF, cGAS-STING, and RIG-I-MAVS pathways,
though their contribution to hematopoietic maintenance is not well understood. In an untargeted metabolomics
screening, we identified 29 microbial metabolites that were enriched in stool and serum samples from non-
leukopenic mice compared to those that were leukopenic two weeks post-antibiotics. Whether these metabolites
can support hematopoiesis in vivo remains unexplored. This proposal will test the hypothesis that the microbiome
utilizes immune-related signaling pathways such as TLR-TRIF, cGAS-STING, and RIG-I-MAVS pathways to
support IFN-I mediated steady-state hematopoiesis at the level of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC).
 A major limitation of our prior work is that a shift in Sca-1 expression caused by IFN-I suppression could
have skewed the enumeration of HSPCs in antibiotic-treated mice. To address this, we will first perform a limiting
dilution transplant to quantify functional HSCs in antibiotics and mock-treated mice. We will also trace the fate of
HSPCs and granulocyte populations by tracking their proliferation, differentiation, and turnover in Krt18-
CreERT2:Rosa26-lox-STOP-lox-TdTomato mice treated with or without antibiotics. To elucidate the mechanism
of microbiome-dependent hematopoiesis, we will characterize the hematopoietic defects in Trif-/-, Sting-/-, and
Mavs-/- mice treated with or without antibiotics. We will validate our results by assessing the sufficiency of TLR,
STING, and RIG-I agonists to rescue antibiotic-associated hematopoietic defects. We will also use IfnbΔβ-luc/Δβ-luc
reporter mice to evaluate the ability of microbial metabolites to sustain basal IFN-I production. These studies will
define the mechanisms by which the microbiome promotes IFN-I production to regulate hematopoiesis."

 Within the years 2013 to 2016, 6.2 million patients were diagnosed with heart failure in the United
States. Heart failure has multiple causes, and many fatal cases include patients being predisposed to
arrhythmias. One mechanism for triggering a pro-arrhythmic state are changes cardiac action potential such as
the prolongation of the depolarization. The main contributor of this rapid depolarization is the ionic current
supplied by the Nav1.5 voltage gated sodium channel within the human heart. In addition, there are multiple
subunits that interact with the channel in a physiological setting including the subunits of intracellular fibroblast
growth factor (FGF) 12A, FGF12B, and calmodulin (CaM). In preliminary data, it has been shown that FGF12A
is upregulated in the left ventricle in failing hearts and that FGF12B is the most prevalent FGF isoform in the
human heart. Both FGF12A, FGF12B and CaM have shown to alter the inactivation of the Nav1.5 channel
through modulation of the DIII and DIV voltage sensing domains (VSD). However, there is no research as to
the combined effects of these subunits and their potential to synergistically modulate the Nav1.5 VSDs. As the
DIII and DIV VSDs are modulated by these proposed subunits, it can be hypothesized that the efficacy of class
1b anti-arrhythmic drugs are also affected by the proposed subunits. These preliminary findings confer to the
two hypotheses: (1) combinations of modulating subunits bound to Nav1.5 can collectively alter gating to
disrupt activation and inactivaiton and (2) the subunits of FGF12A, FGF12B, and CaM will alter the interaction
of efficacy of class 1b anti-arrhythmic drugs. To support these hypotheses, three aims were created. Aim 1 will
focus on determining the biophysical changes the combined subunits have on the Nav1.5 VSDs. The aim will
be accomplished with the use of voltage clamp fluorometry to examine the changes in the activation of the
individual VSDs. Aim 2 will develop a machine learning model to decipher how alterations to the VSD
activations change the overall ionic current. Aim 3 will conclude the proposal by looking at changes in the
effectiveness of the class 1b anti-arrhythmic drugs lidocaine, mexiletine, and ranolazine in response to varying
levels of each subunit. This proposal has implications that stretch both at the biophysical understanding of the
Nav1.5 channel to the clinical application in the use of specific anti-arrhythmic drugs. The overall application
will provide rigorous and exemplary training for the applicant to successfully become a translation research
scientist."

Head and neck cancer, including oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC), is the sixth leading cause of
cancer and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, the five-year survival rate of OCSCC has
only slightly improved in the past 30 years. Recently, immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) therapies have emerged
as a promising treatment to improve OCSCC outcomes, yet only 14-22% of OCSCC patients respond to ICI.
Thus, delineating the mechanisms of ICI resistance represents an opportunity to identify novel targets that may
increase ICI efficacy and improve OCSCC patient survival. CD8 T cells are the primary immune cell type that
kills malignant cells during ICI, and their dysfunction may contribute to ICI resistance. During the chronic
response to a tumor, CD8 T cells enter an exhausted cell state – a dysfunctional phenotype characterized by
decreased ability to lyse target cells. Expression of the transcription factor thymocyte selection-associated HMG
box (TOX) is critical for inducing CD8 T cell exhaustion and is enriched in the exhausted CD8 T cell subset within
single cell RNA-seq datasets of OCSCC patient tumor samples. The genes that are directly transcriptionally
regulated by TOX that promote CD8 T cell dysfunction and may be therapeutically targeted, however, remain
poorly defined. In addition to TOX, malignant cell signals may contribute to CD8 T cell dysfunction and ICI
resistance. We discovered a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (HEM) malignant cell state in OCSCC that localizes
to the tumor edge adjacent to CD8 T cells and is associated with exhaustion of these adjacent CD8 T cells. The
mechanisms of HEM cells underlying this association are not well understood. The primary hypothesis of this
proposal is that CD8 T cell dysfunction in OCSCC is driven by the direct gene targets of TOX in CD8 T cells and
by immunosuppressive contact and paracrine signaling from HEM cells. The goal of this proposal is to define
mechanisms of CD8 T cell dysfunction that may be targeted to improve ICI through the following Aims: In Aim 1,
the direct gene targets of TOX and their role in CD8 T cell dysfunction will be defined in vitro using CD8 T cells
isolated from OCSCC samples. In Aim 2, patient-derived CD8 T cells will be co-cultured with patient-matched
OCSCC tumor-derived organoids or cancer cell lines expressing a model antigen. In these co-cultures, HEM-
specific membrane and secreted proteins will be knocked-down in the malignant cells to determine their role in
suppressing CD8 T cells. The proposed research will provide mechanistic insight into CD8 T cell dysfunction in
OCSCC, thereby supporting development of new strategies to therapeutically activate CD8 T cells and improve
ICI and OCSCC outcomes. Importantly, during this fellowship, I will pursue scientific and clinical activities under
the direct mentorship of a comprehensive fellowship advisory committee composed of physician-scientists and
experts in cancer and immunology research. My proposed training will be vital to accomplishing my goal of
investigating cancer-immune interactions and maturing as an independent, academic physician-scientist."
10974013,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The objective of this proposal is to gain a more complete understanding of the influence of evolutionary
history on the predictability of evolution. Understanding predictability and repeatability of evolution has long been
a goal of evolutionary biologists. Applying these questions to the field of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) provides
the benefit of obtaining clinically relevant results while also studying questions that are fundamental to
evolutionary biology. AMR is a rapidly worsening global health issue, with an increasing number of bacterial
infections becoming impossible to treat with most drugs. Of serious concern is Acinetobacter baumannii, a
nosocomial and highly multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogen. Although resistance is often attained through
common pathways, such as increased drug efflux and modifications to the drug target, it remains unclear how
evolutionary history affects the evolution of AMR, and to what degree or level resistance evolution is predictable.
History (such as genetic relatedness and previous antibiotic exposure) is an underappreciated aspect that
influences evolution and can have lasting effects on the genome that alter or constrain paths available for
adaptation to antibiotic stress.
 To address these gaps in knowledge, we propose to use a preexisting collection of A. baumannii clinical
isolates. The first aim of this proposal focuses on understanding the genetic and phenotypic differences within
these isolates, with special focus on virulence and resistance. Through comparative genomics we will identify
sequence similarity as well as pan-genome composition. We will use known causes of resistance, compiled from
previous studies in the Cooper Lab and others, to create a genome based multi-locus predictor of resistance
phenotypes. We will combine the comparative genomics analysis with results of phenotypic assays for biofilm
formation, growth in different conditions, and persistence, to assess any phylogenetic phenotypic patterns. We
will verify select gene-phenotype associations through molecular engineering, helping to detangle the genotype-
phenotype map of A. baumannii. The second proposed aim will further enhance our knowledge regarding the
predictability of resistance evolvability. We will evolve 20 clinical isolates in the presence of the ribosome-
targeting drug, tigecycline, and monitor the corresponding fold increase of resistance, with the prediction that
initial resistance level will dictate final evolved resistance level. Through whole population, whole genome
sequencing, we will be able to assess the level of predictability to which resistance evolution occurs genetically.
 Completion of this project will not only provide answers to broad evolutionary questions but will also be
a crucial step in the fight against the antimicrobial resistance crisis. We will make conclusions as to what level
AMR is predictable mechanistically. A greater understanding of predictability will have direct clinical importance
and allow for personalized therapeutic strategies for the treatment and prevention of MDR infections."

Anemia is the most common complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD-associated anemia is
often refractory to treatment, and the role of dysregulated iron homeostasis in IBD pathology is unknown.
Accordingly, a better understanding of intestinal iron homeostasis may facilitate new therapeutic strategies for
IBD and IBD-associated anemia. Anemia and inflammation are directly linked by the hormone hepcidin, which
critically inhibits iron release from intracellular stores via the iron transporter ferroportin. In new data, I've
identified that hepcidin produced by dendritic cells (DCs) is critical for tissue healing after intestinal
inflammation, and that hepcidin is highly expressed by DCs in inflamed tissues of pediatric Crohn's disease
(CD) patients. Moreover, hepcidin promoted healing by limiting iron availability to tissue-associated bacteria via
iron sequestration in intestinal myeloid cells. The focus of this research proposal is to investigate the
hypothesis that intestinal iron homeostasis is regulated by hepcidin in chronic intestinal inflammation and in
pediatric Crohn's patients to promote tissue healing. In Aim 1, I will interrogate the role of hepcidin and
ferroportin in chronic intestinal inflammation, iron homeostasis, and myeloid cell biology. In Aim 2, I will define
the regulation of hepcidin and ferroportin expression in humans, and I will probe correlations between this axis,
iron homeostasis, and TNF blockers in pediatric Crohn's disease. I will employ innovative technical approaches
to characterize anatomical iron levels in mice and IBD patient samples, and I will develop new genetic tools to
study the role of hepcidin and ferroportin in myeloid cells. Collectively, results from these studies will define the
regulation and functional significance of intestinal iron homeostasis in IBD, with the potential to define novel
therapeutic strategies for pediatric CD patients."

Regular physical activity is a powerful intervention that reduces obesity and confers protection against
obesity-associated metabolic diseases. The mechanisms responsible are incompletely understood but are likely
to extend beyond activity-associated increases in energy expenditure alone. We recently identified a
lactate-derived metabolite called N-lactoyl-phenylalanine (“Lac-Phe”) as the most significantly elevated
metabolite in blood plasma after an intense exercise bout. We further demonstrated that pharmacological
elevation of plasma Lac-Phe to mimic exercise training can robustly suppress feeding in obese mice, and
repeated Lac-Phe regimen results in chronic hypophagia, weight loss, and reduced adiposity, associated with
improved glucose tolerance. While these findings raise the possibility that Lac-Phe could be used as an
anti-obesity agent, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying Lac-Phe hypophagia remains unknown. Our
preliminary studies identified Agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the
hypothalamus (ARH) as one direct target of Lac-Phe action and mediate its hypophagic response. One
objective is to examine effects of Lac-Phe and exercise on afferent synaptic inputs to AgRP neurons, and
efferent outputs from AgRP neurons to their synaptic targets. Our data also suggest that Lac-Phe inhibits
orexigenic AgRP neurons via increasing an outward potassium current, namely KATP current. Thus, the second
objective is to use the CRISPR-Cas9 approach to genetically disrupt the expression of KATP channel subunits in
AgRP neurons, and use these models to determine the functional relevance of KATP channel in Lac-Phe-induced
AgRP inhibition and hypophagia. Finally, we also observed that Lac-Phe activates neurons in four other brain
regions, the lateral septum (LS), the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), the parabrachial
nucleus (PBN), and the nucleus of solitary tract (NTS). Thus, we will combine the Targeted Recombination in
Active Populations (TRAP) approach with electrophysiology, chemogenetics and scRNA-Seq to determine
whether Lac-Phe stimulates these neurons directly or indirectly, whether these neurons functionally participate
in the Lac-Phe-induced hypophagia, and what are neurochemical identities of these Lac-Phe-activated neurons.
These proposed experiments will reveal the neurobiological basis for Lac-Phe hypophagia, which may identify
Lac-Phe or the associated pathways as targets for weight management."

Non-enzymatic protein-protein and protein-DNA cross-links are deleterious post-translational
modifications that have been associated with many severe pathologies, including cancer metasta-
sis, retinopathy, chronic renal failure, skin and bone disorders, aging, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, Par-
kinson’s and cardiovascular diseases. However, the development of therapeutic strategies is hin-
dered by our poor understanding of their formation. We propose to address this gap in knowledge
using computational methods based on intrinsic electric field calculations. Our goal is to identify
the structural and dynamical molecular factors at the origin of the formation of non-enzymatic
protein-protein and protein-DNA cross-links. We focus our study on sugar-mediated cross-links,
initiated by glycation reactions, as it has been shown to occur in a broad range of systems.
 We hypothesize that partial depletion of the protein (or DNA) hydration layer exposes side
chains (or nucleobases) to surrounding carbohydrates. This facilitates glycation reactions whereby
reducing sugars (glucose) react with the free amine groups. Glycated proteins and DNA then
have enhanced ability to form adducts, altering their biofunction. Our proposed research seeks
to provide a molecular interpretation of sugar-mediated cross-link formation and can be divided
into three thrusts ; each of which with the potential to expand into a standalone research direction.
 First, we propose to characterize the density of the hydration layer of healthy and pathological
proteins and DNA strands known to aggregate (collagen, elastin and α-synuclein) at the quan-
tum level. Our preliminary data on mineralized collagen systems show that water adsorption is
controlled by the nature of the environment rather than the nature of the adsorption site, consistent
with experimental observations. This suggests that the density functional theory protocol we de-
veloped for this study is suitable for the characterization of macromolecule-water interactions.
 Second, we propose to model carbohydrate reactivity in dehydrated and hydrated biomole-
cules, as a proxy for non-enzymatic glycation reactions. The novelty of our approach is to intro-
duce accurate reactivity information in classical molecular dynamics simulations using intrinsic
electric fields as a metric for bond formation. Our preliminary data verify the feasibility of such
study and include the development of an open-source code that allows this type of calculations.
 Finally, we propose to integrate our atomistic data into a microscopic kinetic model of protein-
protein and protein-DNA cross-linking processes. With this model, we aim to predict the critical
density, location, cooperativity and strength of cross-links that are associated with known patho-
logies, paving the way towards the identification of therapeutic points of intervention."

10931455,"Project 1 – Abstract
While mTORC1 is activated in a growth factor-independent manner in most human cancers and is believed to
contribute to the uncontrolled anabolic growth of tumors, mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin and its analogs
(rapalogs) have had limited clinical success as anti-tumor agents. Furthermore, even in settings in which
tumors respond favorably to rapalogs, such as with the genetic tumor syndrome tuberous sclerosis complex
(TSC), the effects are reversible, with rapid tumor regrowth upon halting treatment. This limited response is
due, at least in part, to the strictly cytostatic nature of rapalogs. In order to identify therapeutic strategies to
improve on mTOR inhibitors in both tumor syndromes and sporadic cancers, we must systematically define the
molecular response to mTOR inhibitors inherent to cells and tumors. Thus, in this project, we use both
hypothesis-driven and unbiased omics approaches to reveal the nature and consequences of network-wide
changes in transcription (Aim 1), tumor metabolism (Aim 2), and protein kinase signaling (Aim 3) upon
mTORC1 activation and inhibition. Our approaches combine reductionist cell and tissue models in Drosophila,
where the mTOR signaling network is very well conserved, with syngeneic mouse tumor models driven in part
by uncontrolled mTORC1 signaling. Within the broader context of this P01, this project is discovery-based and
foundational to the overarching goal of the program to define and target the signaling network that connects
the hamartoma syndrome tumor suppressors and mTORC1, impacting both genetic tumor syndromes and the
majority of sporadic cancers. The novel candidate targets and mechanisms revealed through our project serve
as a key point of integration for all 3 projects."

Determining how Aβ and tau degrade neural systems function in Alzheimer’s disease remains an essential
objective. Although much has been learned from models of early onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD), including
demonstration of aberrant neuronal activity and calcium overload in anesthetized amyloid models, the
generalizability of these observations depends on two major caveats: First, it is not clear how findings under
anesthesia extrapolate, particularly as the effects of amyloid and tau appear to depend on behavioral state.
Second, it is not clear whether findings in EOAD models will inform understanding of late onset Alzheimer’s
disease (LOAD), which is far more common and arises in association with multiple genetic risk factors. To
address these issues, we will apply and integrate a series of new technologies. To extend studies to freely
behaving animals and determine the behavioral state-dependence of Aβ’s impact on neuronal physiology, we
will employ the Inscopix mini-microscope to monitor calcium activity together with concomitant multi-electrode
recordings to assess brain oscillations. To extend studies to LOAD, we study and contrast the APP/PS1 model
of EOAD with the new hAbeta.ApoE4.Trem2*R47H model of LOAD. This model, which includes knock-in of the
humanized APP gene in concert with the strong risk variants APOE (humanized ApoE4) and TREM2*R47H,
develops elevated levels of Aβ42 and A?40. To evaluate tau’s contribution to neuronal dysfunction and its
interactions with Aβ in these amyloid models, we employ an AAV vector that expresses equimolar levels of
human tau and GCaMP6f, enabling dynamic calcium imaging in tau-laden cells with the mini-microscope. To
evaluate how the development of tau aggregates interacts with amyloid to affect neuronal physiology, we
combine mini-microscope imaging of dynamic calcium activity with 2-photon imaging of tangles and plaques. We
hypothesize that in both APP/PS1 (to model EOAD) and hAbeta.ApoE4.Trem2*R47H (to model LOAD), Aβ and
tau will be associated with behavioral state-dependent changes in neuronal activity, brain oscillations, and
calcium overload; that tau’s state-dependent effects will dominate those of Aβ in the EOAD and LOAD models;
and that the development of tau aggregates will synergistically interact with amyloid to degrade neuronal activity.
Together, these efforts will establish how Aβ and tau impair neural systems function, advancing Alzheimer’s
disease modeling and informing therapeutic development."

for search, view and download of a range of datatypes to empower their own research. Echinoderms are one
of only three major phyla within the deuterostomes, and therefore the species within this clade encompass a
large taxonomic diversity of body plans. Species of echinoderms are powerful model systems for
understanding the processes by which the genome controls development. The strengths of this experimental

A single driver mutation, BRAFV600E, drives half of all melanomas. However, in the majority of cases,
acquisition of BRAFV600E instead drives benign tumors, such as melanocytic nevi (the common mole). We seek
to decipher the intracellular mechanisms that prevent full transformation, and harness this knowledge to
develop candidate early diagnosis and chemoprevention strategies. We have discovered a signature of
microRNAs (miRNA) as the most differentially expressed transcripts distinguishing nevi from either normal
melanocytes or melanomas. We have reported that expression of these miRNAs classifies biopsied pigmented
neoplasms with high diagnostic accuracy. To determine whether knowledge of these miRNAs could aid in the
prevention of melanoma: First, we conducted a comprehensive identification and functional screen of the
targets of the most predictive miRNA, MIR211-5p. Using freshly isolated and CRISPR engineered human
normal, nevus and melanoma melanocytes, we identified inhibition of AURKB expression as a critical
mechanism driving both BRAFV600E and MIR211-5p associated growth arrest in vitro. Therefore, in Aim 1, our
objective is to assess the roll of the MIR211-5p/AURKB axis in nevus formation and transformation in vivo, and
the efficacy of disrupting this axis in melanoma chemoprevention. Second, we generated a non-invasive assay
for miRNA screening of pigmented lesions prior to biopsy. In a small pilot study, we found the high accuracy of
classification of melanocytic neoplasia was retained. In Aim 2, our objective is to validate the utility of using
non-invasive profiling of the miRNA signature to screen pigmented skin lesions.
Three advances distinguish our proposal. The first is the reproducibility of our miRNA classifier, currently
validated on six independent datasets. Second, our model systems for this disease—engineered primary
human melanocytes, nevi, and melanomas, combined with an in vivo system that recapitulates both the
genetics and progression of melanoma—puts us in a unique position to control for context-specific effects
when studying these critical events. Third, is our development of a non-invasive miRNA profiling assay, a
molecular profiling technique that is both non-invasive and lesion-specific. Our team, consisting of experts in
both the basic biology of miRNA and melanoma, in vivo models of melanoma, topical drug delivery, and the
daily practice of melanoma surveillance, allows us to comprehensively tackle this project.
This project has both basic and clinical potential significance. Our studies explore novel explanations for nevus
initiation, driven by observations made from clinical lesions. We expect these studies to directly result in an
increase in the early detection of melanomas and preclinical validation of a strategy for topical
chemoprevention for particularly high-risk individuals and/oror anatomic areas."

Drug abuse and HIV infection co-exist and are difficult to study due to challenges in people living with HIV
(PLWH) who abuse drugs. One of the prime areas of pathogenic interactions of HIV and drugs of abuse is the
brain, which carries additional study limitations. To obtain rigorous data on the effects of HIV and cocaine on
the brain, we will utilize well-studied nonhuman primate animal model, Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-
infected and uninfected control rhesus monkeys, in the presence or absence of cocaine. Single cell
sequencing assays enable cell type-specific analysis of the role of specific cell types in both healthy brain
function and disease. The overall objective of this proposal by multidisciplinary team of investigators is to
reveal the single cell determinants of brain in the context of viral persistence in SIV/cART/cocaine non-human
primates. Simultaneous single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell Assay for Transposase- Accessible
Chromatin sequencing (scMultiome-seq) will be carried out on cells isolated from the prefrontal cortex (PFC),
striatum, and hippocampus from each animal. Data will be processed and analyzed to derive cell type-specific
regulatory programs and changes in these programs that regulate neuropathogenesis in the primate brains.
These studies will provide unique and valuable insights into SIV/cocaine/cART interactions in the brain while
also providing crucial experimental validation of the findings in humans. Successful completion of these
innovative single-cell studies and data analyses methods will generate a single cell transcriptome and
epigenome atlas of cellular part list for three NIDA-relevant brain regions, PFC, striatum, and hippocampus.
These results will illuminate novel insights into transcriptomic and epigenetic landscapes of CNS and how
they are altered by HIV and cocaine use."

With rapid advanced in genomics, computational sciences, and health informatics, the next decade will likely
experience a rapid interest in big data use to inform genomics medicine. This is likely to raise the enthusiasm
of patients, big data scientists and proponents of genomics medicine. On the hand, the use of big data for
healthcare in general raises ethical legal and social issues (ELSIs) relating to the feedback of individual
genetic results, the use of research participant data to inform clinical care or population health, risk of privacy
breaches and a possible big data global divide. Much can be learned from the growing literature on ELSI of
genomics research in Africa, to anticipate and possibly address some of the ethical issues linked to big data
in genomics medicine. Given the dearth of empirical and normative ELSI analysis on big data in health in
Africa, This UO1 application therefore seeks to develop an ELSI research project that will explore Public
Understanding of Big data in Genomics Medicine in Africa (PUBGEM-Africa). In PUBGEM-Africa, we
specifically aim to: 1) to investigate models of public engagement and preparedness for big data use in health;
2) to explore the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholder groups (data providers, data producers,
data users, funders, and research ethics committees) regarding intellectual property, patents, and
commercial use of genomics big data in health; 3) to investigate public perceptions of big data in health and
attitude towards governance of data; 4) to develop data governance frameworks for big data-driven
innovation and health in Africa. PUBGEM-Africa will directly explore these different questions with populations
living with different genetic conditions namely sickle cell disease (high burden in Africa); non-inheritable
hearing impairment (a vulnerable population) and Fragile X syndrome (a rare genetic condition). This will
allow us to show case, first-hand, attitudes and perceptions to big data use by populations with a genetic
condition and to also design systems for addressing the different ELSIs. PUBGEM-Africa will also the
foundation for establishing a competitive centre of excellence in the ethics of data science for genomics
medicine and emerging biotechnologies in Africa. Our team’s prior experience in implementing various
H3Africa ELSI and genomic projects in Africa; the outstanding institutional environment at the University of
Cape Town; long term collaboration with institutions in Ghana and Cameroon; and an established
collaboration with patient groups (for hearing impairment, sickle cell disease, and Fragile X syndrome),puts
us in a good position to effectively implement an ELSI study on big data in genomics medicine in Africa,
but to also ensure long-term sustainability of ELSI activities on data science and health innovation in Africa."

Advances in the care of preterm and term newborns continues to demonstrate progress. However, adverse
childhood outcomes following morbidities of prematurity (BPD, IVH, NEC and others) and conditions affecting
late preterm and term infants (HIE, PPHN, sepsis) remain excessively high. The overarching goal of the Brown
Neonatal Research Network (NRN) Center is to identify critical gaps that contribute to undesirable newborn
outcomes and expand the evidence base to guide treatment and management with exceptionally high-quality
clinical research. Our specific goals are to bring fresh innovation to the NRN in domains of novel biomarkers,
genomics, neurobehavior and imaging and apply these to the design of timely clinical trials. New trials need to
be rigorous and reproducible since the ultimate measure of impact is whether the results drive change in
clinical practice. To accomplish our goals, the Brown NRN Center has been invigorated with important
leadership transitions among our physician scientists and research coordinator. We anticipate that our new
investigators will provide an infusion of novel ideas and areas of expertise which will build upon our solid
foundation. The latter has been created by our current investigators who will remain active in the NRN and help
maintain our longstanding clinical and research practices. That includes meaningful contributions to the NRN
since 1991 in which Brown investigators have led multi-center trials, made substantial contributions to trial
development, and conducted trials well. Our clinical research productivity is also reflected in our ability to
perform high quality clinical trials outside the NRN framework and reflects a deep commitment to our academic
mission. The Brown NRN Center is based at a single center, Women & Infants Hospital of Rhode Island (WIH)
which functions as the hub of a well-organized perinatal region encompassing all of Rhode Island and
southeastern Massachusetts. WIH performs 80% of the deliveries in Rhode Island and through its Maternal
Fetal Medicine outreach, and maternal/neonatal transports, impacts close to 15,000 deliveries a year. The
Brown NRN Center has close links with our Maternal Fetal Medicine Unit Network (MFMU) colleagues and
have demonstrated the ability to perform secondary studies of a MFMU clinical trial across the two networks.
Our state-of-the-art Neonatal Intensive Care Unit has fully embraced a family-oriented approach to newborn
intensive care where research and clinical management are linked reflecting our strong culture of research.
Critical to the mission of the NRN and any regional center is a well-developed and effective follow-up program
since primary study outcomes are often assessed between 2-7 years of age. The Brown NRN Center uses
innovative programs such as Transition Home Plus to maintain relationships with families after discharge to
home while reducing hospitalization rates and costs. The Brown NRN Center has a comprehensive array of
clinical and research abilities to examine the mother-infant dyad and provide critical collaboration for the
conduct of rigorous, cutting edge, multi-center trials that are the goals of the NRN."

The overarching goal of the Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) Focus
Pilot Core (Core F) is to promote the advancement of science and engineering for predictive analytics, for clinical
decision support, or for the care of adults with AD/ADRD. To advance this mission, we will solicit, fund, and
support pilot projects focused on innovative technologies and AI approaches for several important aspects of
aging in place, and, more specifically, projects that respond to the specific challenges of those with an AD/ADRD
diagnosis. To name a few, we will fund pilots focused on developing AI methods and software for the processing
and integration of data from home monitoring technology with clinical data from EHRs, on analysis of integrated
data using automated machine learning, or on incorporating validated AI models into clinical workflows for
decision support within a health system, in the home, or any other point of care. The core will be led by Dr.
Graciela Gonzalez-Hernandez, Associate Professor of Informatics and Senior Faculty of the Institute of
Biomedical Informatics (IBI) at the University of Pennsylvania, and Director of the Health Language Processing
(HLP) Center within the institute. With over 100 publications in prestigious journals and conferences, Dr
Gonzalez-Hernandez’s 19 years of academic career plus 5 more in industry bring a unique perspective with
respect to the integration of research and applicable software systems, and their adequate construction and
distribution. She was Director of the Database Management and Biostatistics Core for the NIH-funded Arizona
Alzheimer’s Disease Center for 8 years (2008 to 2016), where she helped organize the annual selection of Pilot
Projects. She is a member of the NLM Board of Scientific Advisors (effective as of the Spring of 2021) and of the
NIH Biodata Management and Analysis (BDMA) study section since 2019. She was previously a member of the
NIH/NLM BLIRC study section (2009-2013). Overall, in line with the overarching theme of the PennAITech
Collaborative, Core F seeks to provide comprehensive, integrated, and continuous support and promotion of
Pilot projects that connect novel technologies for monitoring aging adults in the home with research activities
and clinical care, specifically aimed at addressing the acute needs of the AD/ADRD patients and their caregivers
and the specific nuances and progression of AD/ADRD. To our knowledge, a comprehensive pipeline from home
to clinic and back that addresses the many challenges of AD/ADRD does not yet exist. Building and extending
this pipeline will be central to our pilot funding program. The AD/ADRD Pilot Core has the following Specific
Aims: (1) to solicit, review, and support pilot studies that develop or advance the use of AI and technology for
AD/ADRD predictive analytics, clinical decision support, or the care of adults with AD/ADRD, (2) to foster
collaborations among affiliated Penn investigators, our network of peer institutions and research centers, and

10846836,"The Institute of Medicine and National Research Council workshop report on ""The Future of Home Health Care”,
calls for care that is patient and person-centered, seamlessly connected and coordinated, high quality and
technology enabled. The overarching goal of the Aging Focus Pilot Core (Core G) is to promote the advancement
of science using technology and artificial intelligence to optimize health and care management for older adults
living in their homes independently, and those receiving skilled home and community-based services (H&CBS).
We capitalize on the opportunity to reach a national population receiving H&CBS which includes skilled home
health care (HHC), the Program for All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), and Managed Long-Term Services
and Supports (MLTSS), in addition to healthy older adults living in the community. These populations of older
adults present an ideal opportunity to apply AI and technology to promote healthy aging and equitable access to
care and supports; address the needs of vulnerable older adults; avoid institutionalization; maintain quality of
life; and receive appropriate end-of-life care. We propose three aims: AIM 1. Establish a national network of
home care agencies, PACE sites, and MLTSS plans interested in supplying data and/or serving as test
sites for AI and technology solutions to support patients/members, providers, and family caregivers. The
Aim 1 outcome is a comprehensive national database of home care agencies, PACE sites, and MLTSS plans
interested in supplying data, serving as pilot test sites, or as purchasers of commercial products. The national
network of potential pilot sites and customers for commercial products developed through the Collaboratory will
grow each year through networks with our initial partners, contacts at national conferences, and outreach through
professional organizations. AIM 2. Foster collaborations among affiliated Penn investigators and our
network of peer institutions and research centers to grow a cadre of scientists to advance the science
of care within home and community-based services. The outcome of Aim 2 will be annual workshops that
build teams and educate investigators about the data sources, services, policies, and research questions
essential to promote the science of aging in place and bring products to market. AIM 3. Solicit, select,
develop/refine, and manage pilot studies that develop or test AI and technology applications to detect
risk, predict needs, address disparities, improve access to care, and support decision making for
chronic illness management and safe aging in place for older adults and their family caregivers.
Successful funding and completion of 2-3 funded pilot studies per year, dissemination of their results, and
commercialization of products brought to market that detect risk, predict needs, address disparities, improve
access to care, and support decision making for underserved and hard to reach older adults and their caregivers."
10846837,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of the Penn Artificial Intelligence and Technology (PennAITech) Collaboratory is to identify, develop,
evaluate, commercialize, and disseminate innovative technology for monitoring aging adults and persons with
Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) in their home environment and
the artificial intelligence (AI) methods and software for analyzing data generated by those technologies for
improving clinical care. This will help aging Americans live safe, social, and engaged lives. To date, the
science of AI and monitoring technologies has often outpaced existing ethical and policy frameworks, and the
unique ethical and policy implications for older adults, including older adults experiencing cognitive
decline/impairment and their care partners, have largely been overlooked. Therefore, there is a critical need
for ethics and policy scholarship—in conversation both with the science of AI and monitoring technology and
also with the science of aging and AD/ADRD—throughout the research phase, as well as during its translation
into viable interventions. To address this need, the Ethics and Policy Core will work in close collaboration with
the other PennAITech Collaboratory Cores with a focus on four key issues: promoting the autonomy of older
adults by balancing considerations of usefulness and intrusiveness; protecting older adults in light of
vulnerability due to cognitive and functional decline; mitigating bias and addressing health disparities, such as
racial disparities and urban-rural disparities; and safeguarding the data privacy of older adults. In order to
accomplish this, the Ethics and Policy Core has three aims: (1) to provide guidance and training to
PennAITech Collaboratory-funded pilot project leaders, trainees, and industry leaders on ethical and policy
issues encountered in researching and developing AI methods and technologies for healthy aging; (2) to
examine the ethical and policy barriers to using AI methods and technologies for healthy aging from the
perspective of diverse stakeholders, including healthy older adults, adults with AD/ADRD, and care partners;
and (3) to serve as a national resource for the research community by disseminating guidelines and best
practices related to developing AI methods and technologies for healthy aging and translating them into care
with a focus on healthy older adults, adults with AD/ADRD, and care partners. This innovative and impactful
Core will be led by Emily A. Largent, JD, PhD, RN, an authority on bioethical and policy issues in research and
care involving older adults and persons living with AD/ADRD, and it will engage a multidisciplinary team of
experts to reach its overarching goal."

 The Administrative Core provides administrative and financial oversight for all the PREMIER Cores and
ensures the smooth operation of the Center. The Administrative Core coordinates membership, communications
and an enrichment program involving seminars, training workshops, a mentoring program, a Pilot Grant and a
Core Usage Grant program. PREMIER makes patient cohorts and biospecimens, advanced genomic
technologies and complex informatics services accessible through our Resource Cores, along with services to
assist with complex experimental planning. In this way we bring together collaborative groups that can advance
innovative studies in rheumatic diseases. Through training, mentoring and funding opportunities we further
support and encourage young investigators to focus their precision medicine research on rheumatic diseases.
 The Administrative Core creates an infrastructure that supports both PREMIER Investigators and the
Resource Cores. The overall goal of PREMIER is to foster innovative research and collaborative studies that
will lead to better delineation and targeted treatment of complex rheumatic disease."

The Clinical Data and Informatics Core (CDI) Core will provide researchers with access to a full range of services
to facilitate successful use of clinical data for basic, clinical and translational research studies in rheumatic
diseases. The Core will streamline clinical research infrastructure, including study design, research ethics
consultation, patient recruitment, clinical informatics and disease expertise, to advance precision medicine in
rheumatic disease. We propose the following Aims for the CDI Core: 1) To facilitate use of unique clinical study
databases and biospecimens, 2) To provide individualized consultative services to assist in the design,
implementation and analyses of clinical and translational research studies of rheumatic disease, 3) To provide
clinical informatics services and innovations that accelerate the science and operations of clinical and

Library that includes the Genomic Technology and Integrated Bioinformatics Cores. Advancing precision
medicine in rheumatic diseases will require a patient-oriented approach that optimizes coordination of these
highly specialized resources across projects. Key strengths of the Core include internationally renowned clinical
experts in rheumatology, national leaders in clinical research and clinical informatics, and expertise in human
subjects research ethics. Core services will continue to address some of the challenges facing the research
community studying rheumatic diseases. These include the need for well-phenotyped patients with high-quality
clinical data with linked biospecimens for rheumatic conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis,
spondyloarthritis and others; the need to more efficiently identify and recruit patients for clinical studies using
innovative tools linked to electronic health records (EHRs), particularly those with uncommon diseases or clinical
phenotypes; and the current lack of coordination of research infrastructure across ongoing studies, leading to
inefficiencies in patient recruitment, data collection, and data management. Innovations of the CDI Core include
leveraging robust existing clinical informatics infrastructure to bridge the divide between the vast amount of
accumulating clinical data and individual investigators who are interested in specific clinical rheumatic diseases;
developing and disseminating tools for the more efficient and valid use of EHR data for research; and
development of educational modules to accelerate knowledge acquisition among the research community. The
overall goal of these activities is to provide critical and cutting-edge resources that create economies of scale for
researchers at UCSF and nationally conducting clinical research in the rheumatic diseases."
10915715,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Genomic Technology Core
The latest, cutting-edge genomic technologies including bulk and single-cell profiling of the transcriptome (e.g.
RNA-seq), epigenome (e.g. ATAC-seq) and proteome (e.g. CITE-seq), represent powerful new tools for the
advancement of precision medicine research, particularly when used to analyze biospecimens from well
clinically-phenotyped individuals. These rapidly evolving technologies, with their requirements for specialized
sample preparation and storage, genomic expertise and informatics skills, present a challenge for many clinical
and translational researchers in rheumatology, a field where the need for better molecular characterization and
improved delineation of disease subtypes is also a tremendous need. The goal of the Genomic Technology (GT)
Core is to provide autoimmune rheumatic disease investigators turn-key solutions to cutting-edge genomic
assays. To achieve this goal, we propose the following Aims: 1) Develop novel genomic assays and tailor them
for direct application to the investigation of rheumatic disease patients. The GT Core will leverage the innovative
expertise of the Ye Lab to develop multimodal, single-cell sequencing assays, high-throughput single cell
proteomic assays, and spatial single-cell transcriptomic approaches. 2) Provide genomic consultation services
and at-scale services for bulk and single-cell sequencing assays. The GT Core will draw on the collaborative
genomic resource lab, the Genomics CoLab (Led by co-director Dr. Eckalbar), to develop workflows and analytic
pathways geared toward the study of autoimmune disease that can be used by rheumatic disease investigators
following consultation on genomic assay choice and study design, enabling them to implement cutting-edge
genomic technologies for their projects. 3) Integrate and oversee the centralized biospecimen collection, storage
and project tracking systems that are available, to ensure optimal use of patient samples and the integration and
sharing of data between projects. The GT Core will continue to monitor the rigor and reproducibility of complex
experimental pathways to also ensure the quality of the experimental data. The GT Core will closely collaborate
with the Clinical Data Informatics (CDI) cores, to develop project specific sample tracking and metdata storage
systems through Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) to ensure appropriate linkage of clinical data with
biospecimen results. The GT Core will work closely with the IB Core to ensure that genomic data streams can
be easily integrated into analysis workflows. The GT Core provides a robust framework for the application of
novel, cutting-edge genomic technologies and will enable rheumatology investigators to maximally utilize all the
tools available for the advancement of precision medicine research in rheumatology."

aims. In Aim 1, we will provide analytical consulting services in study design, data analysis and data integration
with public datasets in order to advance precision medicine in rheumatic disease research. In Aim 2, the IB Core
will develop novel tools, software and analytical pipelines for the integration, annotation, analysis, retrieval, and
presentation of data from clinical and molecular studies of rheumatic diseases including single-cell sequencing
and CyTOF data. As a result of this Aim, we will furthermore establish and maintain a technologically up-to-date
toolset that can be readily used for systems-level analyses of the data. Aim 3 is to integrate molecular and
clinical data and leverage collaborations between the GT and CDI Cores to facilitate integrative computational
analysis for a wide range of clinical, translational and basic research studies to enable precision medicine in
rheumatology. Finally, in Aim 4, we will provide centralized internal and external data management and storage
including assistance in real-time project development using the UCSF Data Library and in dissemination of data
for P30 associated projects using the Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort). The IB Core will
bring together researchers from different backgrounds and enable investigators whose work can benefit from
access to state-of-the-art computational technologies and approaches, with an overall goal of advancing
precision medicine in rheumatology."
10899491,"Project Summary
This proposal will test the hypothesis that chronic social jetlag attenuates adaptations to exercise training and
increases susceptibility to cardiometabolic stress. Social jetlag (SJL) is a novel and pervasive form of circadian
rhythm disruption caused by desynchrony between scholastic/professional clocks (i.e. - work or school
schedules) and the endogenously driven circadian rhythm (weekend/free day schedules). Recent studies
suggest that almost 80% of the population undergoes some degree of SJL (i.e. – ≥1:00 shift between
weekday/weekend), with nearly 30% experiencing >2 hours of shifting. Social jetlag has been associated with
cardiovascular risk factors and metabolic diseases including obesity, diabetes, and low cardiometabolic fitness
(VO2max). However, it is currently unknown how SJL impacts the exercise training response. As exercise is a
frontline intervention for the prevention and reversal of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, it is essential to
determine if, and when, exercise can be most effectively prescribed and most protective of the heart. We have
previously shown that acute exercise differentially activates myocardial gene expression and signaling
depending on the time of day it is performed in mice with intact circadian rhythms. However, it is unclear how
exercise, and exercise timing, may be impacted during circadian rhythm disruption via SJL. As such, our
overarching hypothesis is that SJL increases the susceptibility to cardiometabolic disease, and the time-of-day
that exercise is performed will modulate its efficacy to elicit training adaptations and prevent cardiometabolic
disease. To address this hypothesis, we will pursue the following three specific aims. 1) Determine the impact of
social jetlag on molecular and physiologic exercise training-induced adaptations in mice, 2) Determine the effects
of temporally prescribed exercise during chronic social jetlag on behavioral circadian rhythms, and 3) Determine
the impact of chronic social jetlag on cardiometabolic health in mice, and potential reversal with TOD-dependent
exercise prescription. Preliminary data presented in this application reveal temporal preference during time-
restricted exercise training (i.e. – mice run further during the first half of the active phase compared to the second
half), with little difference cardiorespiratory fitness, suggesting exercise training in the late active period may elicit
comparable training adaptations with lower volume. How time-restricted voluntary exercise impacts metabolic
perturbations during high fat feeding, as well as during SJL, is not currently known. Successful completion of
these aims will expand upon these findings to include SJL-induced circadian rhythm disruption, and will increase
our understanding on how exercise timing plays a critical role in cardiovascular disease prevention."
10870147,"Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a double-stranded DNA virus that establishes life-long infection in the human host. The overarching objective of our work is to define critical virus-host interactions important for virus replication and latency, which provide targets for antiviral strategies aimed at limiting viral pathogenesis. HCMV encodes a single DNA polymerase (UL54). As herpesviruses encode their own DNA polymerase, it has been broadly presumed that they do not require host polymerases for the replication of their genomes. However, herpesvirus genomes are complex with high-GC content and repeat sequences that constrain the B-family DNA polymerases, such as UL54. Through our collaborative effort, we demonstrated a striking role for specialized host translesion polymerases (TLS pols) in HCMV genome replication and stability. TLS pols function in lesion bypass at the replication fork or in single-stranded DNA gap filling or homology-directed repair that occurs post-synthesis (behind the fork). TLS pols also maintain fragile site stability during unperturbed DNA synthesis. TLS pols include the Y-family polymerases eta (h), iota (i), kappa (k) and Rev 1, as well as the error-prone, B-family polymerase zeta (z). Strikingly, we found that Y-family TLS pols (h,i,k, and Rev1) and pol z are important to maintain HCMV genome stability. Further, our results indicate that pols h, i, and k generate single nucleotide variants across the viral genome. These findings indicate important roles for host TLS pols in ensuring viral genomic integrity and potentially in generating viral genome diversity. We also found that depletion of TLS pols differentially impacts viral genome synthesis and replication. Defining how HCMV maintains genomic stability and the significance of host TLS pols and DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways on the viral lifecycle is important for understanding mechanisms of virus replication and latency. Further, exciting new data indicates a role for host TLS pols in the evolution of resistance to nucleoside antiviral therapies, such as ganciclovir. We hypothesize that HCMV actively recruits TLS pols and coopts corresponding DDR pathways to maintain genome integrity and regulate viral replication and latency. Aim 1 will determine the mechanisms by which HCMV recruits host TLS pols and other DDR repair factors to viral replication compartments and the subdomains in which they function. Aim 2 will define the mechanisms by which host TLS pols and other DDR repair factors act on viral sequences to ensure genome stability and contribute to antiviral resistance. Aim 3 will determine the significance of host DDR pathways to viral latency. These aims are driven by our published work and exciting preliminary data identifying virus-host interactions that control host TLS pols and DDR pathways. Our multi-PI collaborative work establishes the importance of host TLS pols for the stability and diversity of viral genomes and would not be possible without the combined expertise of Drs. Goodrum and Bosco. Further, this study offers the unique possibility of illuminating new insights into the biology of TLS pols in human cells using the HCMV genome as a model system."
10906872,"ABSTRACT:
CAR-T cell therapy is an emerging option for cancer treatment, but its efficacy is limited, especially in solid
tumors, because the effector CD8+T cells become dysfunctional and exhausted in the tumor microenvironment
(TME). However, the key pathways that define the delicate balance between the effector vs. exhausted state of
CD8+T cells remain unclear. Our preliminary data demonstrate that Znf740, a novel member of the zinc finger
family of transcription factors, is critically essential for effector CD8+T cells. Znf740 binds to SUMOylated T-bet
and promotes the effector function and anti-tumor activity of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).
Conversely, in exhausted PD1+Tim3+CD8+T cells, Znf740 expression is downregulated, which disrupts the
Znf740:T-bet complex. Importantly, reconstitution of Znf740 expression rescues exhausted CD8+TILs and
restores their effector function. Further, transgenic expression of Znf740 in CD8+T cells resulted in reduced tumor
growth which was associated with elevated IFN- production by TILs. These key findings led us to hypothesize
that the Znf740:T-bet complex is critically essential for the effector function of CD8+T cells, and the disruption of
this complex in PD1+Tim3+ cells promotes exhaustion of CD8+TILs which can be therapeutically targeted.
In Aim1, we will investigate how Znf740 promotes effector CD8+T cell function and anti-tumor response. Using
newly generated Znf740-/- and T-bet-K208R knock-in mice, we will delineate the mechanism by which Znf740
binds to T-bet through its SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) to form the Znf740:T-bet complex and transactivates the
IFN- promoter in effector CD8+TILs. In Aim 2, we will target Znf740 to overcome T cell exhaustion and promote
tumor regression. We will investigate how disruption of the Znf740:T-bet complex in advanced tumors promotes
an alternate transcription profile of PD1+Tim3+ exhausted TILs. Using newly generated T cell-specific Znf740
transgenic mice, we will test the effect of overexpressing Znf740 in CAR-T cells against carcinoembryonic
antigen (CEA) in the MC38 colon cancer model. Finally, the therapeutic potential of overexpressing Znf740 in
CAR-T cells will be tested in colon cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models.
Completion of these studies will result in the establishment of 1) a novel Znf740:T-bet complex that is critical for
the effector CD8+ T cell function, 2) determine how reduced Znf740 expression disrupts this complex leading to
alternate transcription profile in exhausted CD8+ TILs in advanced tumors, and 3) evaluate the means to target
the Znf740 to overcome the current limitations of CAR-T cell therapy for solid tumors. This could lead to clinical
trials using ""Exhaustion Resistant CAR-T cells"" for improved outcomes in patients with advanced tumors."

The Reducing Overuse of Antibiotics at Discharge (ROAD) Home trial is a 40-hospital cluster randomized trial
to evaluate the effectiveness and understand factors influencing implementation of the ROAD Home
intervention. Antibiotic overuse at hospital discharge is common, costly, and harmful. While evidence-based
antibiotic stewardship strategies exist to improve prescribing, they are not reaching patients as they transition
across care settings. Hospital discharge represents one care transition in critical need of effective stewardship
interventions that can be used across a variety of contexts. In the US, antibiotics prescribed at discharge
account for half of antibiotic use—and up to 90% of days of overuse—related to hospitalization. Discharge-
specific stewardship strategies (e.g., audit and feedback at discharge) are effective at optimizing prescribing;
however, they are resource-intensive and often infeasible to implement across hospitals with variable
resources. Thus, there is a critical need for interventions to improve discharge prescribing that are tailored to
local context, feasible, and effective for diverse hospitals. To address this need, the ROAD Home study team
developed the ROAD Home Framework which specifies evidence-based stewardship strategies to improve
discharge antibiotic prescribing. The ROAD Home Framework is the foundation for the ROAD Home
Intervention, a participatory intervention that supports hospitals in implementing evidence-based stewardship
strategies to improve discharge antibiotic use. The ROAD Home Intervention includes three components: 1)
discharge stewardship needs assessment, 2) facilitated selection of strategies using the ROAD Home
Framework, and 3) an implementation blueprint. The overarching goal of this study is to evaluate the
effectiveness and understand the implementation context of the ROAD Home Intervention. The central
hypothesis is that hospitals participating in the ROAD Home Intervention will have fewer days of antibiotic
overuse at discharge compared to usual care hospitals. The proposed trial will leverage the researcher’s
extensive prior success conducting antibiotic stewardship research with the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety
Consortium (HMS), a group of 69 hospitals working to improve care for hospitalized patients. The specific aims
are: (1) within HMS, conduct a 40-hospital parallel cluster randomized trial to test the effectiveness of the
ROAD Home Intervention on days of antibiotic overuse at discharge in hospitalized adults with CAP and UTI,
(2) conduct a mixed-methods concurrent process evaluation to identify contextual factors influencing
implementation of the ROAD Home Intervention, and (3) create and refine a ROAD Home discharge
stewardship toolkit. There is an urgent need to improve antibiotic prescribing at hospital discharge. Building on
prior AHRQ-funded work, this study will rigorously evaluate the innovative ROAD Home Intervention and
inform broad national dissemination efforts to ensure that reductions in harm and improvements in quality due
to antibiotic stewardship are equitably distributed, reaching all patients regardless of where they receive care."

Accurate DNA replication is a fundamental process that governs the survival of every organism.
Cellular DNA is under constant assault from various sources. The cellular replication machinery
frequently encounters and is severely vulnerable to agents that stall its advancement, leading to
replicative errors, development of mutations, and various forms of genetic instability. As a result
of this, elevated levels of replication stress is a characteristic hallmark of various disease
conditions. It is therefore critical to understand in molecular detail the varied mechanisms by
which cells respond to and adequately repair damaged DNA during replication stress. Although
we know a lot about how breaks in DNA are repaired, there is a major gap in our understanding
of how cells adequately respond to replication stress in part due to the lack of genetic and
biochemical tools to probe these processes. To gain further insights into the processes involved
in the replication stress response, and in order to identify and characterize the panoply of genes
required for this pathway, during my postdoc I performed whole genome screens in multiple cell
lines following perturbations with low doses of replication stress-inducing agents. From these
screens I generated a novel dataset that includes multiple genes that have yet to be linked with
genome instability. Several newly identified genes were linked to chromatin responses,
replication fork maintenance pathways, regulation of nucleotide biosynthesis and others. Of
note, I identified the Protexin complex, consisting of the single stranded DNA binding protein
SCAI and the DNA polymerase REV3. Protexin was critical for maintaining genomic instability
by regulating single stranded DNA accumulation through unknown mechanisms. These screens
also revealed a striking role for RNA dependent processes in the replication stress response, a
novel layer of regulation that had not been appreciated before now. Among our top hits, we
identified several novel RNA helicases and RNA-binding factors, as well as several non-coding
RNA molecules, demonstrating a crucial, intimate link between RNA-dependent processes and
adequate maintenance of genome stability. My lab will take advantage of this vast resource of
newly identified factors to characterize novel genome maintenance mechanisms. Investigating
these novel factors will allow us to decipher in detail the concerted, multi-layered repair
response and fork restoration control upon exposure to DNA damage. We will (1) characterize
the mechanism of single stranded accumulation following replication stress. 2) Identify
mechanisms by which RNA-modifying enzymes function in the replication stress response, and
3) elucidate roles for non-coding RNA genes during the replication stress Response.
Completion of these research projects will grant us significant and fundamental novel insights
into how cellular genomes are maintained in the face of damaging insults, grant us improved
mechanistic understanding of the principles of cancer pathogenesis in greater detail and open
up novel avenues for exploiting defective DNA repair processes in the treatment of cancers."

Adoptive T cell therapies (ACT) including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are novel immunotherapies
with unparalleled successes, especially in patients with leukemia. However, they have limited efficacy in solid
tumors. One barrier to success is the ability of ACT to penetrate the solid tumor microenvironment (TME),
where adoptive T cells often encounter resident suppressive immune cell lineages. The administration of
lymphodepleting conditioning in the form of chemotherapy, fludarabine/cyclophosphamide (FLU/CY) prior to
the infusion of T cells is a critical step to ensure T cell engraftment and persistence. The addition of total body
irradiation (TBI) to FLU/CY can further enhance lymphodepletion but comes at a cost of off-target toxicity.
Thus, the use of an agent that can more selectively lymphodeplete may improve the efficacy of ACT without
increased off-target toxicity. LLP2A is a peptidomimetic small molecule with a high affinity for very late antigen-
4 (VLA-4), expressed at high levels in lymphocytes and several cancers including melanoma and
neuroblastoma. Here, we propose to test VLA-4–targeted 67Cu-LLP2A radionuclide therapy (TRT) as a single
agent or in combination with dose-reduced (DR)-FLU/CY prior to ACT in two syngeneic solid tumor models
(pmel-1/hgp100 B16 melanoma and GD2 CAR/NXS-2 neuroblastoma model). We hypothesize that the
combination of 67Cu-LLP2A + DR-FLU/CY is a more effective lymphodepleting regimen than FLU/CY alone
(Hypothesis 1). We also hypothesize that 67Cu-LLP2A TRT can reduce tumor burden through direct radiation-
induced cell death and can facilitate T-cell mediated killing. We hypothesize that this new 67Cu-LLP2A
conditioning regimen will extend the survival of mice with VLA-4–expressing solid tumors treated with ACT
through greater penetration and activity of adoptive T cells within solid tumors (Hypothesis 2). To prove this, in
Aim 1, we will use state-of-the-art dosimetry and biodistribution studies to determine the dose where 67Cu-
LLP2A as a single agent or combined with DR-FLU/CY can achieve adequate lymphodepletion for ACT without
causing toxicity as well reduce tumor burden through direct cytotoxic effects. Then in Aim 2, we will examine
the ability of systemically administered 67Cu-LLP2A to enhance the efficacy of ACT in two syngeneic solid
tumor models. After completion of these aims, we will demonstrate that 67Cu-LLP2A TRT has the potential to
redefine current conditioning approaches for ACT and improve the outcomes of patients with solid tumors."

Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (SNH) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) are the most common causes
of morbidity in newborns worldwide, with both symptoms being linked to human breast milk (HBM). Enteral
formula feeding is a direct biomarker for the induction of NEC in preterm newborns, while HBM protects
against NEC. In newborns, HBM suppresses UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 expression, the only
transferase capable of conjugating bilirubin, thus contributing to the development of hyperbilirubinemia.
Humanized UGT1 (hUGT1) mice that express the human UGT1A1 gene mimic what is observed in
humans with neonatal hUGT1 mice developing SNH. As an animal model to examine the mechanisms that
lead to regulation of the UGT1A1 gene, we have documented that the UGT1A1 gene is repressed in liver
tissue, which plays a key role in total serum bilirubin (TSB) accumulation. While approximately 10% of the
neonatal hUGT1 mice develop Kernicterus Spectrum Disorder (KSD), which is lethal, most of the newborns
are healthy, have normal reproductive cycles, and represent an excellent model to study the underlying
mechanisms linking UGT1A1 expression to SNH. New findings from our laboratory have demonstrated that
the delay in intestinal UGT1A1 expression is controlled specifically by the nuclear receptor transcriptional
corepressor protein, NCoR1. When NCoR1 is rendered non-functional through genetic knockout experiments
in the intestines, neonatal TSB levels are normal and intestinal UGT1A1 is dramatically induced, resulting from
intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) maturation. The delay in intestinal UGT1A1 in neonatal hUGT1 mice is a direct
result of breast milk, since formula feeding leads to significant induction of UGT1A1. HBM plays a key role
in the development of SNH by blocking bilirubin metabolism while simultaneously protecting newborns against
NEC. Thus, we hypothesize that the underlying mechanisms leading to SNH are also linked to the underlying
mechanisms that regulate NEC. This may not be a coincidence but crucially important to understand, since
bilirubin is a potent antioxidant that could combat oxidative stress induced intestinal inflammation, which
leads to NEC. Thus, the focus of our efforts will determine if complimentary cellular mechanisms are tied to
the development of both SNH and NEC. The major focus areas, based upon current publications and
preliminary findings, will be to tie the role of microflora, TRL4 signaling, HBM oligosaccharides, and
neonatal IEC maturation, with the control and regulation of SNH and NEC. The experiments outlined
are anticipated to lead to a greater understanding of these syndromes, made available using novel mouse
models and advanced technology that will allow us to connect the early biological events after birth leading
to the developmental control of SNH with those same processes that will be tied to the onset of NEC. Because
there does not exist effective therapeutic interventions for the treatment of either SNH or NEC, the long-term
goal of this work and the unraveling of the mechanisms leading to these syndromes will be to use this
information to improve the development of effective therapy."

Anemia impacts ~25% of the world’s population and contributes to adverse outcomes. Several forms of anemia,
including anemia of inflammation (AI) and iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) are caused in part by
pathologic iron (Fe) restriction. In these conditions, chronic immune activation or genetic mutations upregulate
the Fe regulating hormone hepcidin, which in turn inhibits activity of ferroportin, the only known Fe exporter.
Hepcidin excess thus imposes a severe form of hypoferremia as Fe liberated via hemoglobin recycling in
macrophages, nutritional iron absorbed by enterocytes, and other stored Fe cannot be exported to the plasma
iron-carrier protein transferrin for distribution.
 Fe replacement in patients with hepcidin excess can be challenging. Most intravenous Fe replacement drugs
are Fe-carbohydrate nanoparticles that are accumulated and metabolized in macrophages, requiring ferroportin
for Fe mobilization. Thus, iv replacement can simultaneously have limited efficacy for anemia correction while
potentially contributing to Fe overload in macrophages. Hepcidin-driven Fe restriction also limits the efficacy of
nutritional Fe supplements. There is no clinically available hepcidin-modulating drug. Erythropoiesis stimulating
agents (ESA) may offer a therapeutic benefit for some patients, but are associated with cardiovascular toxicity,
thrombosis, and malignancy in some studies.
 An alternate approach is to deliver Fe directly to transferrin via mechanisms independent of ferroportin. An
intravenous formulation comprising iron pyrophosphate citrate (FPC) that releases Fe directly to transferrin has
FDA approval for use during hemodialysis. However, care must be taken to ensure that serum FPC
concentrations do not exceed serum total Fe binding capacity, as exposure to toxic labile Fe occurs above this
threshold. To safely administer therapeutically meaningful quantities of Fe, FPC is slowly infused over hours.
 There remains an unmet need for drugs to efficiently and safely replenish Fe via ferroportin-independent
pathways. We posit that a highly effective direct-to-transferrin Fe replacement drug can be developed through
the judicious application of coordination chemistry principals. Here, we propose drug design based on a set
prospectively defined molecular properties. Preliminary in vitro and in vivo data in support of our approach is
provided using the complex Fe-BBG (BBG = N,N-(bis)-2-hydroxybenzyl-L-glutamic acid) that we synthesized as
our initial drug prototype. We will iteratively synthesize and screen a library of complexes for efficacy and safety
signals. Promising candidates will be advanced to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy for anemai correction in
rodent models of IRIDA and chronic kidney disease. The output of this work will be one or more de-risked
candidates for development as direct-to-transferrin Fe replacement drugs."
10914909,"Cognitive deficits such as learning and memory impairments are common in people subjected to chronic
disturbance of the circadian cycle due to shift work, travel, or genetic dysregulation of the circadian clock.
Epidemiological studies have revealed a global rise in cognitive disorders with circadian disruptions comorbidity
such as depression, and Alzheimer’s disease, stressing the need to identify the causal relationship between
these phenomena. However, the molecular mechanisms linking the circadian cycle and cognitive performance
in health and disease remain largely unresolved. Neuronal synapses are the cellular basis for learning and
memory processes. Synapse number, activity, and expression levels of synaptic proteins show rhythmic time-
of-day-dependent changes, yet how these changes are regulated by the circadian clock is poorly understood. A
growing body of work supports a critical role for the glial cells, astrocytes in normal clock function. Astrocytes are
important synaptic regulators, and key for establishment and maintenance of memory and learning. Yet, how the
astrocytic clock regulates synaptic rhythmicity and related cognitive performance has not been thoroughly
examined. This critical gap in knowledge must be addressed in order to understand not only the fundamental
functions of the astrocytic clock, but also to characterize the regulatory mechanisms that control circadian
changes in synaptic levels. This application will define the role of astrocytic clocks in regulating synaptic
rhythmicity and subsequent learning and memory behaviors in three aims. Aim 1 investigates how the astrocytic
clock expressed in brain regions responsible for cognitive processes (e.g., cortex, and hippocampus; outside the
central clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)), affects time-of-day-dependent changes in synapses
and cognitive performance. Aim 2 investigates how the astrocytic clock is regulated by calcium activity to
influence synaptic rhythmicity. In Aim 3, we test the hypothesis that astrocyte-derived synapse-regulating factors
are rhythmically produced to facilitate time-of-day-dependent modulation of synapses. Successful completion of
these aims will uncover the role of astrocytic clock in regulating synaptic and cognitive rhythms, and reveal
strategies for future manipulation of synaptic rhythmicity through astrocyte-targeting, to restore clock-associated
cognitive deficits prevalent in neurological disorders."

The purpose of the Developmental Research Program (DRP) is to fund promising projects by investigators
whose current work may not focus exclusively on ovarian cancer, but who propose highly innovative
translational studies of ovarian cancer that could become full SPORE projects or compete successfully for
funding outside of the SPORE. The DRP provides a unique opportunity for making available significant financial
support, and for demonstrating active institutional support, through a program that is rapidly responsiveto new
ideas or initiatives. Moreover, this program is rooted in a spirit of collaboration promoted by the SPORE
investigators who have an extensive track record of bringing investigators from other disciplines into ovarian
cancer research. The strength of the DRP rests in its ability to make available financial support needed to
access all the critical expertise and resources within the entire SPORE. This will allow us to develop
collaborative, multi-investigator, multi-institutional research projects with the support of innovative, investigator-
initiated projects that have the potential to flourish into reliable and productive translational research projects
that make a path from basic and/or population research projects into research focused on human clinical
specimens/patient populations. Over the course of the past decade, the MD Anderson OvarianSPORE has
supported DRP projects from 22 investigators. Collectively, these investigators have published 470 peer-
reviewed manuscripts related to ovarian cancer. Thirteen of the recipients have received peer-reviewedfunding
in ovarian cancer as either PI, Co-PI or Co-Investigator. The investigators have received funding from three
R01s, three R21s, three CPRIT awards, two Department of Defense Awards and four OCRA awards. One

Despite many decades of research in early identification of autism, there remain lengthy gaps between parents’
first concerns and formal diagnosis and subsequent access to specialized services. Challenges in reducing this
gap include long waitlists, lack of specialized providers in many communities, and the lack of validated screening
tools for infants under 18 months of age. Due to methodological challenges in recruiting sufficient numbers of
infants with early specific concern for autism in any one geographic area, most studies of early development
have focused on infant siblings of children with autism. Telehealth offers the opportunity to expand the scope of
early identification studies and conduct the crucial foundational work needed to determine the developmental
trajectories and outcomes of infants with early developmental concerns in community settings throughout the
United States. We have previously demonstrated the initial feasibility of this approach in our preliminary work
developing the Telehealth Evaluation of Development for Infants (TEDI; R21 HD100372 and R21 HD 105161, PI
Talbott). Behavioral measures obtained via TEDI are reliable, valid, and highly satisfactory to families.
Importantly, we have also found that the majority of infants in our sample have elevated scores on early
measures of autism traits, developmental challenges in communication, language, and motor skills, and elevated
likelihood of autism relative to general population norms. This preliminary work indicates the need for more
thorough examination of this group of infants. We propose to prospectively follow a group of 100 infants ages 6
– 12 months with early parent concerns. We will evaluate them using the TEDI telehealth protocol at four visits
each 3 months apart. At 36 months, we will conduct an outcome visit via telehealth to generate clinical best
estimate outcomes. The project will address 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the proportion and
predictors of autism outcomes. Under Aim 2, we seek to characterize the development of a community-based
sample of infants later diagnosed with autism by examining differences in developmental trajectories between
outcome groups, as well as predictors of developmental outcomes across groups. Finally, in Aim 3, we will
identify best practices for supporting family engagement and satisfaction with telehealth-based assessments,
and the cultural appropriateness of the TEDI for diverse communities, which will directly support the
implementation of telehealth screening and assessment in community settings beyond the COVID-19
pandemic. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to significantly increase families’ access to
specialized evaluations and increase the capacity for early identification of infants in need of services. It will
also lay the groundwork for future efforts to conduct screening and intervention trials and may ultimately help to
increase access to high-quality interventions and improve the developmental outcomes of many more
underserved children with autism and other NDD’s."

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), which includes alcohol-associated cirrhosis (AAC) and alcohol-
associated hepatitis (AH), is now the leading indication for liver transplant (LT) in the US. Early LT (eLT),
defined as LT evaluation with <6 months of alcohol abstinence, is associated with acceptable outcomes for AH
in retrospective studies. However, prospective, multi-center data including biopsychosocial factors on eLT for
all advanced ALD in racially, culturally, and socioeconomically diverse populations are lacking. It is known that
alcohol cessation is the most important factor influencing survival in ALD, and integrated alcohol use disorder
(AUD)/ALD care is critical to help patients achieve abstinence, yet the degree of care integration and how this
influences post-LT outcomes has not been systematically studied. Knowledge gaps in eLT for ALD include: a)
limited data on who gets referred for eLT and referral barriers; b) lack of standardized biopsychosocial
measures and outcomes; and c) minimal stakeholder involvement beyond LT providers. There is an urgent
need to (1) define factors influencing eLT referral, (2) develop risk prediction models of key patient-centered
outcomes, (3) incorporate validated biopsychosocial measures into models, and (4) evaluate the impact of
integrated care on outcomes following eLT. For example, The INTEGRATE collaborative, comprised of
diverse, multidisciplinary clinicians and researchers from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,
University of Michigan, University of Miami, and Columbia University-Weill Cornell Medicine, is ideally
positioned to address these urgent research needs. Collectively, we have developed a distinctive investigator
team with diversity in: (1) career stage (2) sex and race/ethnicity, (3) clinical and methodological expertise in
ALD, AUD, LT, behavioral research, risk modeling, data harmonization, health disparities, causal inference,
and mixed-methods research, and (4) documented track record of NIH funding in LT access, organ allocation,
LT outcomes and healthcare disparities, and NIAAA funding in ALD/AUD. Our large volume transplant centers
with established protocols for eLT for ALD applied to highly diverse populations will facilitate the following aims:
1) characterize and develop risk prediction models for transplant-free survival among those with limited access
to LT to define those in greatest need of eLT referral and listing; 2) evaluate barriers and facilitators to referral
for eLT in ALD; 3) apply causal inference approaches to observational data to evaluate biopsychosocial factors
and develop risk models predictive of outcomes at key timepoints in eLT for ALD; 4) define stakeholder
perceptions and preferences for selection and outcomes in eLT for ALD; and 5) evaluate how integrated care
processes influence outcomes in eLT for ALD. At the conclusion of this work, we will have collaboratively: (1)
defined factors for referral and waitlisting for eLT in ALD (selection), (2) identified which biopsychosocial
factors are causally related and predictive of outcomes most important to stakeholders (outcomes) and (3)
determined how integrated care influences stakeholder-relevant outcomes in eLT for ALD (management)."

Defects in human eye development can result in a broad spectrum of ocular disorders, many of which lead to
partial or complete vision loss. The human eye is comprised of many specialized tissues derived from
different primordial cell lineages, and their formation is highly coordinated over time, making ocular
development a very complex process. Human ocular cell culture systems commonly used for disease
modeling fail to recapitulate earlier stages of this stepwise developmental process. Consequently, it remains a
challenge to efficiently test how patient variants impact developing structures within the eye, thus contributing
to the observed complex ocular phenotypes. To overcome this barrier, we aim to explore the recently
presented cell culture model where human iPSCs are induced to form multiple ocular cell types organized
within four identifiable, concentric zones - referred to as self-formed ectodermal autonomous multi-zone of
ocular cells (SEAMs). Uniquely, each zone is comprised of different cell types found within the eye, including
neuroretina, retinal pigmented epithelium, cornea and lens, and zone formation occurs progressively over
time, mimicking the timing and cell-cell coordination observed during human eye development. The primary
objective of this proposal is to delineate quantifiable morphological benchmarks and gene expression
signatures associated with SEAM generation under normal conditions and then test this model by introducing
disease-associated genetic variants in well-known ocular genes. Specifically, we aim: (1) To characterize
SEAM morphology, variability and gene/protein expression during their formation; (2) To explore the effects of
pathogenic human variants in key ocular genes on SEAM formation. In our approach we will measure
changes in size, shape, and other physical characteristics and appearance of SEAMs at four timepoints along
the differentiation process. Concurrent scRNA-seq analysis will define the identity of the cell types within the
multi-zones and determine their equivalence to developing human ocular tissues. These analyses will be
established first under normal conditions and then extended to assessing SEAMs derived from hiPSCs
carrying pathogenic variants in well-known ocular genes (PAX6 and FOXE3). Completion of these studies will
identify strengths and possible limitations of this innovative model system for studying human whole eye
development. Thus, this study will likely provide a platform for testing a wide range of genetic variants
identified in congenital ocular phenotypes including identification of the direct and secondary effects of those
variants on coordinated development of various ocular tissues."

Fibrosis is a consequence of a myriad of skeletal muscle diseases including Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
Fibrosis is the pathological accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) and impairs muscle function resulting in
a loss of mobility and significant reduction in strength. Muscle resident fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) are
the key source of ECM deposition in skeletal muscle. Pro-regenerative FAPs support regeneration by
activating in response to injury, depositing ECM to replace the damaged matrix, and releasing pro-myogenic
signals. However, in the context of fibrosis, there is a significant upregulation of a more pro-fibrotic FAP
subpopulation. FAPs activate into myofibroblasts and remain at chronically high levels, leading to excess ECM
deposition. What drives the development of a fibrotic versus regenerative FAP phenotype is not well
understood. The mechanics and architecture of the ECM is altered in fibrotic muscle compared to healthy
muscle, providing mechanical cues to surrounding cells. FAPs are known to be sensitive to these changes in
mechanics and architecture, however, what drives this signaling pathway is not understood. Yes-associated
protein (YAP) is strongly correlated with FAP activation into myofibroblasts on stiff substrates. Blocking YAP
activity is a potential method to manipulate FAP-ECM signaling and reduce myofibroblast activation in the
context of fibrosis. ECM signaling to FAPs may also influence the heterogeneity of FAPs, with the levels of pro-
regenerative and pro-fibrotic FAPs changing during injury and fibrosis. How the subpopulations of FAPs may
be contributing to ECM deposition in fibrosis and regeneration is not well understood. Elucidating the
differential role of FAP subpopulations provides specific targets for anti-fibrotic and pro-myogenic therapies.
Our central hypothesis is that blocking FAPs’ sensitivity to stiff substrates through inhibition of YAP will
reduce the number of pro-fibrotic FAPs resulting in ECM deposition that promotes myogenesis. We will test our
central hypothesis via two aims. In Aim 1, we will inhibit YAP activity in order to determine its role in FAPs’
sensitivity to engineered matrix substrates mimicking the mechanical and architectural features of healthy and
fibrotic ECM. In Aim 2, we will determine the differences in ECM deposition from pro-fibrotic and pro-
regenerative FAPs and its role on myogenesis to assess how the heterogeneity with the FAP population
affects the development of fibrosis and regeneration. Success in these aims will identify the interactions
between FAPs and the ECM in the context of fibrosis, which can be used as targets for anti-fibrotic therapies."

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity in the
United States (US). HDP (e.g., preeclampsia) present a cascade of health issues for pregnant persons and
fetuses. While HDP are not rare in the US (affecting approximately 1 in 12 women), Black women face unique
risks and challenges regarding HDP and pregnancy-related mortality (PRM). HDP are more prevalent among
Black than White women. Black women also experience more severe HDP than White women. Further, Black
women experience the highest rate of pregnancy-related deaths: 41 vs. 16.7/100,000 births in the overall
US. Pregnancy-related racial/ethnic disparities persist over time across age groups and groups with higher
levels of education. There is no evidence to suggest that genetic or other inherent differences by race/ethnicity
explain these disparities; race/ethnicity instead are suggested to represent an amalgam of individuals' social,
cultural, political, and economic experiences throughout the life course. Given that pregnancy is also a critical
period in the life course, the psychosocial environment during pregnancy is suggested to impact physiologic
pathways involved in obstetric and perinatal health. However, the pathways by which the psychosocial
environment influence racial/ethnic differences in maternal health outcomes remain unknown. One explanation
for these disparities is the experience of psychosocial stress, evidenced by higher mean allostatic load scores
among Black women due to psychosocial stress. Therefore, psychosocial stress in pregnancy is a plausible
mediator contributing to racial/ethnic pregnancy disparities. Using a nested case-control design with data from
a racially diverse cohort, the NICHD-Nulliparous Mothers To Be Study (nuMoM2b), this proposal will assess
whether the effect of self-reported race/ethnicity on HDP is partially mediated by psychosocial stress in
pregnancy. This study will also explore if the mediated pathway is moderated by social support during
pregnancy. Social support is conjectured to function as a coping mechanism that helps individuals overcome
psychosocial stress. Study aims are to (1-2D) examine the total effects of self-reported maternal race/ethnicity
and HDP, including the indirect effect through a mediated pathway via psychosocial stress, and (3) evaluate if
perceived social support modifies the partially mediated models. This study will go beyond the traditional
approach in the literature of describing differences between groups and instead propose that the social
construct of race/ethnicity represents the cumulative lived experiences of individuals belonging to a specific
racial/ethnic group. Execution of these specific aims will advance the NICHD mission to understand human
development, improve reproductive health, enhance the lives of children and adolescents, and optimize
abilities for all. Specifically, by elucidating possible causal pathways to reduce maternal health disparities."

The development of the amygdala includes an increase in size and cell number during adolescence, which is
thought to confer maturation of emotional and social behaviors before adulthood. Perturbations in this process
are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and behavioral pathology; yet the cellular components of
adolescent amygdala development are unknown. In humans, the paralaminar nucleus of the amygdala (PL)
contains a large population of immature excitatory neurons that delay their maturation until adolescence. The PL
may be a major contributor to adolescent amygdala development, but the physiology and connectivity of the
region is yet to be investigated. Our recent work has shown the existence of an orthologous population in the
mouse amygdala, opening a tractable model system to study the PL in detail. My initial electrophysiology
experiments indicate putative physiological subgroups within the adult mouse PL. Based on past primate studies
and the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity atlas, inputs to and outputs from the adult PL may also show diversity.
The goal of this proposal is to define the functional identity of the adult PL by classifying intrinsic electrical and
morphological neuronal subtypes, dissecting their synaptic input patterns, and mapping their outputs. The
training proposed in the advanced techniques of viral tracing, light sheet microscopy, whole-cell patch clamp,
optogenetics, and morphological reconstruction will facilitate the exploration into the functional phenotypes of
mouse PL neurons. These proposed studies are crucial to understanding the role of the PL in amygdala function
and behavior, as well possible involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders."

Research: Lower respiratory infections such as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are the leading cause
of infection-related deaths worldwide. Emerging evidence suggests that adverse long-term health outcomes
are more common in CAP survivors compared with patients hospitalized for other reasons, challenging the
concept of CAP as solely an acute disease. The mechanisms underlying adverse long-term CAP sequelae are
unknown, although dysregulation of the host immune response during acute infection has been postulated to
be a contributing factor. Moreover, the clinical and biological heterogeneity of CAP serves as a major barrier to
identification of individualized and targeted therapies, which may impede prevention of adverse long-term
outcomes. In Thailand, the burden of CAP is high and in the northeastern region of the country the Gram-
negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei is the most common and deadly etiology. Studying CAP due to
this single pathogen (Bp-CAP) may help to disentangle CAP heterogeneity and host-mediated determinants of
long-term outcomes. Utilizing a uniquely large multicenter prospective cohort of patients hospitalized with Bp-
CAP in Northeast Thailand, Dr. Coston will address the following Aims: (1) Determine if admission CAP
severity is associated with adverse outcomes after discharge; (2) Identify pro-inflammatory cytokines
associated with adverse outcomes after discharge; (3) Identify novel subgroups of Bp-CAP by applying
clustering strategies to routinely collected clinical and laboratory data. The proposed work will yield insight into
determinants of long-term outcomes and heterogeneity in Bp-CAP, which could facilitate identification of
modifiable factors and host-focused tailored therapeutics in the future. Such findings may be generalizable to
other CAP etiologies and are an important area of future study.
Candidate/Environment: The candidate, Dr. Coston, is a promising junior investigator who is beginning his
career as a clinical-translational physician-scientist focused on the global threats pneumonia and severe

longitudinal cohort data, cluster analysis, study of biomarkers in the host response to infection, and ethical
conduct of research in global settings. The research and training proposed in this project will further Dr.

disseminates the knowledge and mechanisms developed throughout this process to increase the awareness of
the opportunities for Al innovation addressing the needs of older adults and their family caregivers through
research and education programs. The specific aims of the Technology Identification and Training Core are 1)
To convene experts in Al and in Aging Research to develop and apply a stakeholder-informed Al
Readiness Framework {AIRF) to identify promising technology directions to support older adults' and
caregivers' needs. In collaboration with the Stakeholder Engagement Core, and guided by a participatory
ergonomics approach. We will achieve this aim by convening stakeholders and by developing stakeholder-informed
conceptual frameworks outlining key domains of older adults' and caregivers' technology needs to
support optimal well-being and resilience. We will also conduct structured identification and assessments of Al
suitability and maturity to meet the needs identified, 2) To create in-person and on line training tools that both
exploit and expand our knowledge of the Implementation Science for Al, and 3) to develop and deploy
instructional tools that describe Science of Translation of Artificial Intelligence {All for Older Adults and
related best practices for wider use and dissemination. Successful completion of these aims will provide a
process for building on stakeholder-informed principles and develop a platform for continuously updated needs
assessment and technology readiness assessment instruments that will support a national program to tailor Al
to address the needs of older adults and their family caregivers. The current proposal will address and fill key
knowledge gaps and directly engage stakeholders in co-design efforts. The transdisciplinary research team is
poised to complete the specific aims that will result in identification of older adults' needs related to wellbeing
and resilience, characterization of risks to older adult safety from multiple perspectives, and the refinement of a
process that will enable healthcare systems and engineers to identify and design technology to address older
adults' and caregivers' needs. In doing so, the current proposal directly facilitates technology development to
allow older adults to thrive."
10848410,"The Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Artificial Intelligence (Al) and Technology Collaboratory (AITC) proposes
a Clinical Translation and Validation Core that aims to cultivate and support cutting edge Al prototype testing
and exploratory studies that are needed to develop crucial larger scale and confirmatory pilots in order to
advance the development of effective Al technologies to facilitate independence in older adults. This core is
designed to serve as a hub and a clinical laboratory for innovators to validate prototypes and undertake
rigorous feasibility testing for the Al algorithms and technology devices in clinical and ""real-world"" settings. The
specific aims of the Clinical Translation and Validation Core are 1) To provide state-of-the-art scientific (Clinical
and Engineering) expertise and work with the administrative core to facilitate soliciting proposals and
identifying and selecting Al approaches or technologies to be clinically validated in the Collaboratory or our
partner sites; 2) To develop and maintain a research registry with emerging Al approaches or technologies to
be validated in clinics and identify clinical researchers (and their clinical studies) and other stakeholders
interested in validating Al algorithms or technologies in their clinics or other real-world settings; 3) To provide
the AITC investigators identified in aim 1, with mentorship and training in all aspects of human subjects'
research, including study conceptualization, study design and outcomes, definition of interventions,
measurement, data analysis, protocol development and implementation, regulatory approval, quality
assessment, and standard operating procedures related to aging, dementia and the maintenance of
independence; 4) to provide intellectual leadership necessary to identify and match Al researchers with clinical
research investigators that are best suited to successfully validate prototypes and undertake rigorous feasibility
testing for the artificial intelligence algorithms and technology devices in both clinical and ""real-world"" settings;
and 5) to facilitate the transition of successful prototypes into clinical studies in collaboration with the
leadership of the Pilot Cores (Aging and AD) as well as all other cores. To achieve these goals, the core is led
by an Al and technology development experienced investigator partnered with a Geriatrics Clinician Scientist
with expertise in translational research focused on physical and cognitive decline in older adults. This balanced
leadership will facilitate the development, implementation, and conduct of prototype development and testing in
this core. A highly skilled and experienced research program manager with expertise in minority recruitment
and the measurement of frailty and mobility will facilitate the completion of these aims. These aims will be
carried out in collaboration with the leaders of all other cores. Additional resources are provided by the JHU
Institute of Clinical and Translational Research, which will help to ensure optimal study design, implementation,
measurement, and interpretation of results, and Fast Forward, a translationally-focused unit at JHU, will
facilitate health technology development that focuses on using Al to maximize independence in older adults."
10848412,"The long-term objective of the Networking and Mentoring Core (NMC) is to support the mission of the JHU
AITC by establishing innovative research, education, and outreach networks beyond the institution's
boundaries and bringing in resources to build AITC programs at a quicker pace than it can do with the P30
grant alone. This core also aims to help establish a cadre of diverse and interdisciplinary, well-trained, highly
motivated pilot awardees who will become leaders and mentors in AI and aging and its translation into
strategies to maintain independence, health, and robustness of older adults. The NMC aims to accomplish this
objective through five specific aims: 1) To expand the reach of the AITC by bringing together unique resources
from industry, government, academia, and non-profit groups to advance science and mentor the next
generation of technologists and clinicians who innovate for older Americans. 2) To launch a state-of-the-art
online platform in which the best evidence on Al and aging science, clinical practice, and healthy aging,
including those produced by the AITC, are efficiently disseminate to stakeholders. 3) To promote scientific
interaction on AI and aging to support the field's progress to the benefit of older adults. 4) To curate a portfolio
of online materials that provide in-depth training on key aspects of AI and aging. 5) To develop a diverse and
interdisciplinary group of pilot awardees, including those from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups and
disadvantaged backgrounds. To achieve these aims, the core proposes to build three overlapping partner
networks of experts in innovation and commercialization, education and mentoring, and stakeholder
engagement. Members come from academia, government, companies, advocacy groups, patients, families,
payers, and providers. Collaborations within and across these networks will be actively managed in quarterly
and annual meetings, ideation events, policy briefings, and investor conferences, with the results affirmatively
disseminated by electronic, print, and in-person modalities."
10848415,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of Pilot Core (PCA) for Alzheimer's disease/Alzheimer's disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) is to
take a multidisciplinary collaborative approach to identify, develop, refine, and disseminate promising
technologies that have high potential to improve the health and wellbeing of older Americans living with
AD/ADRD and/or their caregivers, with an emphasis on those that can mitigate current disparities in access
and delivery of dementia care in the US and globally. Specific aims are to: (1) develop a national call and fund
pilot projects focused on the application of AI and machine learning-supported technologies to improve the
health and well-being of older adults with AD/ADRD and/or their caregivers; (2) ensure pilot projects are well-
designed, timely and rigorous by providing intellectual leadership, oversight, and access to all of the AITC
resources; (3) assist in the further development and translation of completed pilot projects into products that
will benefit older adults with AD/ADRD and/or their caregivers; and (4) expand the expertise and network of
funded investigators focused on advancing dementia - related AI technologies.
Pilot projects will use Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches and technologies to broadly address four key
research domains: Person Living with Dementia Care and Engagement; Diagnostics and Assessment; System
Management and Administration; and Caregiver and Workforce Support. Projects will be consistent with the
overall themes of this AITC and NIA's AD+ADRD Research Implementation Milestones. Projects will use a
range of new technologies, adaptations, and/or integration of multiple technologies to address issues within
these major domains. These include, but are not limited to, big data analytics, natural language processing,
mobile/cloud/smart device technologies, robotics, image and biometrics, digital biomarkers, imaging, and
integrated platforms that can host and integrate multiple technologies (e.g. electronic health records combined
with administrative and sensed data).
The Core features an ambitious research agenda that features a well-qualified, visionary, and multidisciplinary
team to advance dementia care quality, access, and delivery through harnessing the potential of new AI,
machine learning and other technologies. Our goal is to produce products that address the multifactorial
determinants of health and well-being and that can transform care “on the ground” for older adults living with
AD/ADRD and their caregivers."
10910895,"The Administrative Core is an essential component of the P01 application. The Administrative Core will
maintain a central leadership structure and support core resources for the two Research Component projects
proposed in this P01. The Administrative Core will provide a research infrastructure that help to ensure
harmonization of measures across the two projects, so that data can be combined for future analyses led by
the P01 Data Science Core. The Administrative Core will help to connect the new P01 research activity with
existing infrastructure that our team has developed over the past decade as part of Southern HIV Alcohol
Research Consortium (SHARC). The Specific Aims of the Administrative Core are to: (1) Provide centralized
leadership and strategic planning. (2) Provide administrative and clinical research support related to
recruitment, data collection, safety monitoring, quality control, and biorepository storage. (3) Integrate our
research with our ongoing training, development, and community engagement activities. The Administrative
Core will support a P01 Leadership Committee, co-chaired by MPIs Drs Cook and Cohen, that will receive
input from a Program Advisory Committee and a Community Advisory Board. The Administrative Core will
provide shared support for general research administration, regulatory monitoring, and recruitment/data
collection. The Administrative Core will also ensure staff training, clinical research monitoring, and
biorepository storage. Core services will support an an ongoing research recruitment team based at the
University of Miami (UM) that is integrated with several research support organizations at UM including the UM
Center for AIDS Research (CFAR). The Administrative Core will connect our P01 research with our existing
T32 training program and other training activities, with the community engagement activities of the SHARC,
and with other national HIV-alcohol consortia and P01-related activities supported by NIAAA. Overall, the
Administrative Core will help to ensure that the research conducted within this P01 is integrated and connected
to other alcohol-HIV research teams nationally and internationally, that we develop a diverse research
workforce via connection to our training programs and research collaborative network, and that we maintain
partnerships with healthcare providers and the community."
10910897,"The Data Science Core (DSC) will provide critical support for the P01 project as a whole to ensure its success
by offering a central source related to research design, data management, statistical analysis and machine
learning. The DSC has assembled a team of highly qualified investigators with a broad range of expertise in
HIV research including design of clinical trials, statistical inference methods, integration of diverse -omics data
and neuroimaging data, data management, data security, machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI), and
analytics. The DSC will also provide training services in collaboration with the training programs in other
components of this P01. In addition to supporting the proposed two intervention studies in the P01, the DSC
will leverage existing data resources to test important hypotheses and build prediction models and
personalized recommendation tools for treating HIV infections for patients who are heavy drinkers. When the
data from Projects 1 and 2 are available, cross-cohort prediction and personalized recommendation tool will be
constructed with state-of-the-art statistical learning and machine learning techniques. Specifically, our aim one
will provide support in study design, data management, data sharing, statistical analysis, and research
dissemination to ensure proper and efficient conduct of the two research projects. Working closely with the
Administrative Core and two project teams, this aim will carry out a series of tasks including (but not limited to):
development of centralized study database and web-based Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system; generate
randomization schemes; design and implement quality control procedures for data collection/processing; train
site staff in the use of data collection and data management system; provide support in data masking, data
harmonization, and data sharing. Based on the existing data from the Thirty-Day Challenge Study, our aim 2
will perform causal analysis and AI modeling to explore causal relationships between baseline characteristics,
changes in alcohol use, changes in neuroimaging and microbiome biomarkers, and changes in neurocognitive
functions. This aim will build a baseline prediction model to predict change in alcohol use after the intervention
wit baseline information. Multi-scale dynamic modeling will be used to integrate voxel-level, tissue-level,
region-level, and lobe-level neuroimaging information for prediction of alcohol abstinence. We will also identify
the key changes in multimodal neuroimaging and microbiome biomarkers associated with levels of alcohol
abstinence. Direct effects of baseline characteristics on changes in neurocognitive functions, and their indirect
effects through changes in alcohol use, neuroimaging and microbiome biomarkers will be estimated and
tested. Our aim 3 will use the data from two new randomized clinical trials to validate and refine prediction
models developed in Aim 2 and build a personalized intervention recommendation tool. Cross-cohort validation
will be conducted in each of the two new clinical trials using established protocols and in the pooled data of the
two trials to validate and refine the baseline prediction models for predicting alcohol use reduction. Longitudinal
cross-cohort learning will be employed to create a uniform prediction model across three research projects and
build a personalized intervention recommendation tool."
10910900,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcohol misuse in people living with HIV (PLWH) is a public health issue given relationships to cognitive and
physical effects, which may subsequently accelerate HIV progression, increase likelihood of transmission and
hasten related comorbidities. Thus, efficacious interventions to reduce alcohol use in PLWH are needed.
Specifically, contingency management (CM; tangible reinforcement to change behavior) has been efficacious
for alcohol intervention in the general population, but there are no published studies focused on testing CM for
alcohol misuse in PLWH. Our current project testing 30-day CM including a subsample of PLWH (U01
AA020797) has promising preliminary findings. Despite its efficacy, remaining concerns about CM typically
relate to long-term feasibility given financial costs or the possibility that negative behaviors will return when
reinforcement ends. Thus, there is a need for approaches to extend CM beyond a limited period and make this
approach amenable to wide dissemination. In this proposed P01 component project (N=120), we will
implement several innovations to address feasibility concerns with an eye to research using implementation
science methods in community health centers and clinics. Our novel approach will marshal mobile health
(mHealth) capabilities, alcohol biosensors and gamification, which may enhance engagement through social
connections and friendly competition. We will extend our current CM research by enrolling a wider range of
participants regarding drinking behavior, age and comorbidities in a 30-day CM induction period. Bio-
confirmation will be based on smartphone breath alcohol readings with identity confirmation. Our findings
indicate the majority of PLWH avoid heavy drinking for at least 30 days with CM but a considerable minority do
not, making prediction of outcome based on key baseline characteristics important. After 30 days, participants
will be engaged in a motivational interview (MI) including personalized feedback based on reductions in alcohol
use, enhanced cognitive and/or physical functioning. Following the 30-day CM induction and MI, responders
will be randomized to 1 of 3 conditions to inform progress toward disseminable CM: 1) CM with intermittent
reinforcement, plus novel, mHealth-based gamification; 2) CM with intermittent reinforcement without
gamification; 3) or non-contingent reinforcement (control condition). In this innovative, second 30-day period,
reinforcement will be based on wrist biosensor not breath alcohol readings and on a weekly rather than daily
basis including reinforcement for bio-confirmed drinking moderation, not only abstinence. Follow-up will occur
at 60, 90 and 180 days. Primary aims will test the magnitude of increases in percent days abstinent during the
30-day CM induction and baseline predictors of outcome (e.g., drinking severity, executive function). We will
also test alcohol abstinence as a predictor of cognitive, biological and HIV outcomes. In addition, we will
compare acceptability and preliminary efficacy across the 3 study conditions during the second, 30-day CM
period. This project is an initial step to implement affordable, technology-based CM for alcohol in PLWH."
10910904,"RC2 Summary
 The overarching goal of Research Component 2 (RC2) is to determine whether two non-invasive biological
interventions, transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (tVNS) and a probiotic supplementation intervention (PBI), will
improve cognitive and brain functioning, systemic and neuroinflammation, and gut microbiome health in people living
with HIV (PWLH) who are high risk users of alcohol. The study will also delineate mechanisms of the gut-brain axis, which
is particularly relevant, given that the factors underlying adverse cognitive and brain effects of alcohol use among PLWH
remains unresolved. There is also considerable public health significance if beneficial effects of tVNS and/or PBI can be
demonstrated, as cognitive disturbances that adversely impact health outcomes, functional abilities and quality of life
are common (~ 50% prevalence), despite marked reductions in mortality in the era of antiretroviral therapies (ART).
Among PLWH with reconstituted immune function and undetectable viral loads, comorbid conditions remain common
and can have adverse functional consequences. High risk alcohol use, prevalent among PLWH, not only contributes to
cognitive and brain dysfunction, but also further exacerbates comorbidities (e.g. liver disease, hepatitis coinfection,
obesity, and cardiovascular and gastrointestinal dysfunction), and reduces treatment adherence while increasing the
propensity for high risk sexual behaviors, worse health outcomes, and transmission of the virus. The study’s clinical
significance is strong given the need for effective interventions to improve cognition and health outcomes in PLWH.
 To test these hypotheses, we will conduct a hybrid randomized clinical trial that will enroll 80 PLWH who are high
risk drinkers from our existing research infrastructure supported by the Southern HIV Alcohol Research Consortium
(SHARC). In a 2x2 factorial design, participants will be randomly assigned to one of 4 conditions (tVNS+placebo, sham-
stimulaiton+placebo, tVNS+probiotic, sham-stimulation+probiotic). We will obtain data on alcohol consumption,
cognitive assessments, blood biomarkers, stool microbiome, and neuroimaging at three timepoints (baseline, 30-days,
90 days)."

The Minnesota Tissue Mapping Center (MN TMC) for Senescent Cells (SnC) Administrative Core (AC) will be
led by two PIs with synergistic expertise: Dr. Laura Niedernhofer, an expert in cellular senescence who
participated in the numerous NIH Think Tanks that led to this Common Fund U54 RFA, and Dr. Constantin
Aliferis, Director of the UMN Institute for Health Informatics (IHI) and Chief Research Informatics Officer. The
main goals of the AC are to facilitate the interaction of all of the MN TMC cores to maximize the TMCs
productivity and to create a seamless interface between the MN TMC and other TMCs, the Consortium
Organization and Data Coordinating Center (CODCC), and the technology grant (UG3/UH3) awardees to
maximize the synergy and productivity of the SenNet Consortium. The specific responsibilities of the AC are
to: i) coordinate and provide oversight for the activities of the MN TMC Cores to facilitate access to human
tissues, subject clinical data, tissue analysis, data analysis, and data integration; ii) administer a pilot project
program focused on developing innovative approaches to identify and characterize SnCs; iii) coordinate MN
TMC activities with those of the other TMCs, including working with our Data Analysis Core (DAC) and the
CODCC to create standard operating procedures (SOPs) for data management and dissemination; and iv) work
with the DAC to ensure delivery of the data generated by our TMC to the CODCC in a timely fashion and in
compliance with the SenNet standard operating procedures and Common Data Elements set by the SenNet
Steering Committee.
The goals of the AC will be achieved through the following aims: 1) Oversee and coordinate efforts of the MN
TMC to ensure that research goals and milestones are met with highest quality standards; 2) Integrate input from
the MN TMC DAC and the SenNet CODCC to develop and ensure compliance with SOPs for generating data
sets that enable the development of a multi-dimensional atlas of SnCs with healthy human aging. 3) Oversee
and coordinate the exploration and evaluation of novel approaches for detecting, deeply phenotyping, tracing,
and selectively eliminating senescent cells as technologies emerge from pilot projects, Technology Development
Projects (UG3/UH3), other TMCs, and other relevant groups studying senescence or building cell atlases; and
4
) Coordinate the activities of MN TMC with other TMCs to optimize research efficiency and economies of scale
and scope, including contributing to the adoption and/or further development of data standards, analytic tools,
data sharing/visualization/discovery tools, and multi-site studies and training activities. Successful execution of
these aims will optimize the operations of MN TMC, maximize our contribution to SenNet, ensure SOPs that
enhance the rigor and reproducibility of the data collected on SnCs, and ensure compliance of our TMC with the
Standard Practices established by SenNet."
10899782,"Project Summary
Senescent cells (SnCs) accumulate with age and in various chronic disease states and clearly contribute to
driving morbidity and mortality in model organisms. Drugs that selectively eliminate SnCs (“senolytics”) were first
developed by our team and have been demonstrated to reduce frailty, extend median lifespan, and attenuate
morbidity in murine models of numerous age-related diseases. However, SnCs also play a role in wound healing
and tissue remodeling. To advance senolytics to their greatest potential, then, it is imperative to understand more
about SnCs in humans with healthy aging. As part of SenNet, the proposed Minnesota Tissue Mapping Center
(MN TMC) has selected four tissues for identification, characterization, and spatio-temporal analysis of
senescence: adipose, skeletal muscle, liver, and ovarian tissues. These tissues were selected because of the
scientific expertise at UMN and Mayo Clinic in the biology of these organs, evidence of increased senescence
with age, and availability of biobanked specimens as well as surgical access to fresh tissues from healthy
individuals. The overall goal of the Biospecimen Core (BSP), co-directed by Dr. Sayeed Ikramuddin, Chair of
the UMN Department of Surgery, and Dr. Oyedele Adeyi, Professor of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, is
to provide the tissues and blood for PBMC isolation to the Biological Analysis Core (BAC) for bulk, single cell,
and spatial analysis of human SnCs for subsequent multi-plex analysis of the results by the Data Analysis Core
(DAC). The BSP will leverage their strong track
record of obtaining high-quality, well-annotated human samples
from non-chronically diseased individuals who are metabolically characterized and with appropriate diversity in
gender, race, socio-economic status, ethnicity, and other relevant diversity parameters. The BSP will also
provide access to
UMN’s specimen procurement network (BioNet) that has ~70,000 archival tissues (frozen,
FFPE) and biofluids (frozen) collected for research, including several adipose depots, several muscles, liver from
organ donors, and healthy ovarian tissues removed because of benign lesions. In addition, the BSP has access
to tissues within the Rochester Epidemiology Project, which encompasses the medical records of all citizens
living in Olmsted County, MN since 1966, along with archived biological specimens. The Aims of the BSP are
to: 1) Prepare and maintain all regulatory materials supporting human tissue collection; 2) Recruit and consent
patients of different ages for this project; 3) Characterize the metabolic health of enrolled participants; 4)
Coordinate with BioNet for intraoperative specimen collection, annotation, and storage of tissues; 5) Procure and
annotate high quality target tissues along with relevant biofluids; 6) Longitudinally follow patients for which weight
loss and bariatric surgery are metabolic perturbations; 7) Disseminate the samples to MN TMC BAC; and 8)
Partner with SenNet to share tissues and to develop shared patient consent and tissue collection protocols with
appropriate Ethical, Legal and Social Implications and quality control and assurance considerations."

The Data Analysis Core (DAC) of the Minnesota Tissue Mapping Center (MN TMC) of Senescent Cells (SnCs)
is co-directed by Constantin Aliferis, an expert in biomedical data science and bioinformatics modeling with a
long track record in successfully leading large-scale informatics cores; Jinhua Wang, a senior bioinformaticist
specializing in single cell data and integrative genomics; and Steve Johnson, an expert in data management,
data quality and informatics services, and collaborative science. The DAC also includes experts in causal and
predictive modeling (Dr. Kummerfeld), omics imaging (Dr. Pengo), modeling of cell dynamics and cell
movement (Dr. Odde), and statistical planning, quality control measures, and statistical hypothesis testing (Dr.
Guan).The overall goal of the DAC is to be the final step in the construction of a MN TMC 4D SnC atlas for
healthy human adipose, liver, skeletal muscle, and ovarian tissues to be delivered (along with all supporting
data) to the SenNet Consortium Organization and Data Coordinating Center (CODCC) for the construction of a
human 4D SnC Atlas. Healthy human tissues over a range of ages will be analyzed with both bulk and single
cell characterization and spatio-temporal analysis by the MN TMC Biological Analysis Core (BAC) using samples
provided by the Biospecimen Core (BSP). The DAC will be responsible for data ingestion from BSP and BAC,
mapping to interoperable and searchable ontologies, annotation, curation, and analysis. It will build data storage,
search, retrieval, analysis, and visualization tools and link human specimens to a rich set of de-identified health
metadata from corresponding electronic health records. In collaboration with the SenNet consortium, DAC will
establish benchmarks, contribute to standard operating procedures and standards development, and ultimately
prepare and share datasets with the CODCC to enable a final 4D human SnC atlas with healthy aging. DAC will
leverage cutting-edge informatics, high performance computing, expert faculty, and advanced data storage and
management capabilities at the University of Minnesota (UMN). It will use existing data/metadata standards,
software tools, and analysis methods that ensure reproducibility and usability. DAC will deploy ontology and
analytic standards widely accepted in the fields of high throughput omics and data capture, harmonization,
transfer, security, and analysis and that are germane to the task of creating an atlas of SnCs. The DAC will also
work closely with the other TMCs and the CODCC to develop and implement customized SenNet-wide standards
fine-tuned to the needs of the consortium; data quality metrics, ontologies, and data elements; integration of
imaging and omics data; analytical tools for visualization, segmentation, and annotation; SOPs; Common Data
Elements (CDEs); and the network's public data sharing policy. The DAC will finally conduct a preliminary study
in collaboration with Mayo Clinic (Drs. LeBrasseur and Mielke) that will comprehensively illustrate how the
resulting data can be utilized to build a functional SnC atlas and establish a set of SnC biomarkers."
10899786,"Project Summary
Senescent cells (SnCs) accumulate with age and contribute to driving morbidity and mortality in model systems.
SnCs also play a role in normal physiology – for example, wound healing. It is currently unclear when and where
SnCs arise in tissues as we age, how heterogenous SnCs are in vivo, and how to best identify them, especially
in humans. The overall goal of the Minnesota Tissue Mapping Center (MN TMC) Biological Analysis Core (BAC)
is to validate, optimize, and apply state-of-the-art methods for bulk and single cell characterization and spatio-
temporal analysis of SnCs in healthy human tissues over a range of ages. The MN BAC will focus on adipose,
skeletal muscle, liver, and ovarian tissues from healthy humans, which will be provided by the Biospecimen Core
(BSP). The analytical data generated by the BAC will be delivered to the Data Analysis Core (DAC) via a web
portal for integration with health data to develop 4D SnC tissue atlases and, eventually, models/predictions of
SnC health impact. The BAC will be co-directed by Paul Robbins, an expert in characterizing SnCs and in the
development of senolytics, and Andrew Nelson, a board-certified anatomic and molecular pathologist with
extensive experience in bulk and single cell analysis of human tissue. The BAC analytical workflow will be based
entirely within existing cores and institutes at UMN to guarantee stable infrastructure and high quality control
standards: the University Imaging Centers (directed by Mark Sanders), the UMN Genomics Center (directed by
Kenny Beckman), the Center for Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics (CMSP, directed by Tim Griffin) and
multiple labs at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota (coordinated by Nathan LeBrasseur). State-of-the-art technologies to
be applied to mapping SnCs include digital droplet PCR, single cell and single nucleus RNAseq, tissue clearing,
RNAScope, CyTOF, IonPath Multiplexed Ion Beam Mass Imaging, Visium Spatial Gene Expression, and
NanoString GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling. In addition, the CMSP will use a proteogenomic approach to identify
novel SnC-specific protein sequences as biomarkers. The BAC will also model early and deep senescence in
vitro using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) differentiated into hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, granulosa
cells, and myogenic and adipocyte progenitors. These cells will be induced to undergo senescence by a variety
of stressors to validate SnC probes, identify new SnC biomarkers, and characterize the evolution of senescence
over time. Broadly, the BAC proposes to: 1) Establish a pipeline of reproducible, validated, and quantitative
assays to detect and characterize SnCs in bulk tissues and single cell preparations; 2) Use iPSC-derived
differentiated cells of multi-lineages as a controlled model for validating analytical tools and expanding the
repertoire of SnC biomarkers; 3) Scale-up the data generation pipeline and incorporate emerging technologies;
and 4) Perform spatiotemporal analysis of SnCs in the four tissues in order for the DAC to generate a 4D atlas
of SnCs."
10839310,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Mutual exclusivity and co-occurrence of cancer causing mutations are due to pairwise genetic
relationships that include oncogenic redundancy and synthetic lethality. These interactions suggest that the
cancer-promoting effects of one mutation are dependent on the presence of another, a contingency that can be
exploited in the development of new cancer therapies. Certain mutations have contrasting effects, promoting
cancer in one mutational context but limiting it in another. SETD2 inactivation in lung adenocarcinoma occurs
in 9% of tumors overall, and frequently co-occurs with oncogenic KRAS, but is mutually exclusive with
oncogenic EGFR, the most frequent driver genes of this disease. Our lab was the first to identify SETD2 as a
potent tumor suppressor in a KRAS-driven mouse model. However, paradoxically, Setd2 inactivation prevents
tumor growth in the context of oncogenic EGFR, suggesting an antagonism between these alterations. The
opposing effects of Setd2 inactivation are surprising given that KRAS is directly downstream of EGFR and
activates the MAPK pathway, a driver of many cancer types. Given that KRAS and EGFR share this major
tumorigenic pathway, I hypothesize that Setd2 inactivation is specifically synergistic with activation of the
MAPK pathway, but incompatible with a separate pathway that is also downstream of EGFR.
 An important clue in deciphering this incompatibility is the epistatic relationship between SETD2 and
LKB1, another frequently inactivated gene. Although both genes are powerful tumor suppressors in KRAS-
driven models, co-mutation conferred no additional growth advantage, indicating that these genes act in the
same pathway. Additionally, Lkb1 inactivation has the same paradoxical antagonism in EGFR-driven tumors.
Inactivation of Lkb1 results in constitutively activated mTORC1 signaling which is a common feature of many
cancers. My preliminary data demonstrate that Setd2 inactivation also promotes mTORC1 activity in KRAS-
driven tumors. Likewise, oncogenic EGFR directs mTORC1 signaling via the PI3K-AKT axis and is reliant on
this pathway for tumor maintenance, while oncogenic KRAS is not. Given the stimulation of mTORC1 signaling
by Setd2 and its synthetic lethality with oncogenic EGFR which also activates mTOR, I hypothesize that the
heightened mTORC1 activity present in Setd2-inactivated tumors is incompatible with oncogenic EGFR. To
test these hypotheses, I first aim to determine whether Setd2 inactivation is synergistic with oncogenic MAPK
signaling using a BRAF-driven mouse model. Second, I will determine whether excess mTORC1 signaling is
responsible for EGFR-SETD2 antagonism by modulating this pathway in each driver context using tumor cell
lines. This study will begin to characterize the synthetic lethal relationship between two frequently mutated
genes in lung adenocarcinoma. Understanding these interactions will enable development of new therapies
that target genotype specific vulnerabilities."

The Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) is a clinical research program
dedicated to addressing important issues in the field of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) and Adoptive
Cell Therapy (ACT). CIBMTR maintains a large outcomes registry with information for >625,000 HCT/ACT
patients in treatment centers in the United States and internationally and provides statistical support and
scientific expertise for analyzing those data. A separately funded research repository of biospecimens linked to
these clinical data is available for a large subset of HCT recipients. CIBMTR recently began collecting patient-
reported outcomes (PROs), information collected directly from the patient to understand their experience of the
therapy and its impact on their quality of life and links these data to clinical outcomes. CIBMTR is dedicated to
supporting research to inform clinical practice for patients with cancer and non-malignant blood disorders. Use
of the registry by thousands of investigators around the world during the current and previous funding cycles
has contributed to >1,700 publications on important issues. This knowledge has been disseminated to multiple
stakeholders to speed innovation across our field and improve outcomes for our patients. CIBMTR will
continue to build on the infrastructure made possible by the support provided by the NIH, and in this application
proposes to enhance this registry and to advance its utility through the following specific aims:
Resource Development: To maintain and enhance the scope and broad usability of the registry by
adding new indications (e.g., solid tumors, infection) and data types (e.g., PROs) and optimizing the data

10708522,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (PROJECT LEADER CHAN)
The over 90,000 U.S. drug overdose deaths in 2020 resulted primarily from people who started using drugs,
and escalated their use, due to interacting factors of individual attributes and social network influence. Timely
allocation of intervention resources has the potential to effectively reduce the harm and associated personal,
healthcare, and societal costs of those impacted by substance use and misuse. There are currently no data-
driven tools that allow stakeholders to predict an individual’s substance use, yet such tools would be valuable
in identifying and aiding those most at risk of developing high rates of substance use. Current methodologies
only rely on trend analyses, establishing correlations between risk factors such as friends that use drugs
and substance use. A key challenge when modeling future substance use lies in the co-evolution of behaviors
like drug use and peer networks of risk/support, which can change over time and may depend on each other.
To untangle the co-evolution process of individual attributes and peer networks, the objective of this project
is to develop separate probabilistic models that forecast individuals’ patterns of future substance use at
short and long timescales and peer risk/support networks at long timescales. This will contribute to the long-
term goal to develop stochastic simulations of realistic substance use disorder-related behavioral contagion
in plausible dynamic networks to inform resource allocation and contingency planning. Using deidentified
secondary data from the Rural Drug Addiction Research Center’s (RDAR) Regional Health Cohort, the project
team will first model how individual attributes such as drug use and adverse childhood history, along with
peer networks that include the extent of peer and confidant drug use, impact an individual’s substance use
behavior. They will also model how individuals’ peer risk/support network links form or break in response to
similarities or differences in attributes, including their drug use behaviors. This project is expected to result in
the first stochastic forecasting models using data on covariates of individual attributes and peer network
features. The models will be designed to predict future substance use and future peer risk/support networks
at long timescales within months (Aim 1) and future substance use at short timescales within days (Aim 2).
Successful machine-learning methods will be used to build these models and rigorously assess model
generalizability/prediction performance (Aims 1 and 2). Project findings will provide a foundation for Project
Leader Hau Chan to submit an innovative NIH R01 application to develop stochastic simulations of realistic
substance use disorder-related behavioral contagion in plausible dynamic networks, which will ultimately
inform resource allocation and contingency planning and lay the groundwork for just-in-time interventions to
detect imminent increases in future substance use to trigger the delivery of social and behavioral
interventions. These outcomes closely align with the RDAR’s overall mission to understand substance use
experiences and inform outreach, prevention, and treatment efforts."

Young adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are less likely to enroll in college, earn signifi-
cantly lower GPAs if they do enroll, and are susceptible to a range of adverse outcomes. These include increased
risk-taking, higher rates of criminality, and higher prevalence of comorbid disabilities. One of the most common
comorbid conditions of adult ADHD is substance use disorder (SUD), with nearly 30% of those with ADHD diag-
nosed with a non-alcohol related SUD during their lifetime and 42.7% with an alcohol use disorder. Costs asso-
ciated with ADHD are estimated to total up to $141 billion annually from both direct costs (e.g., legal fees, injury,
property damage) and indirect costs such as lost income due to missing work or being fired. The addition of a
SUD confers an additional economic burden of $193 billion. However, substance use alone use does not explain
the relationship between ADHD and poorer academic outcomes. Instead, ADHD and substance use confer
unique and substantial risks for academic functioning, placing college students with ADHD who use substances
at a compounded risk for adverse outcomes. Students with ADHD make up 6% of first-year college students and
are more likely to enroll in 2-year colleges. Current published research on substance use among college students
with ADHD has been primarily drawn from studies based in 4-year colleges using cross-sectional designs. The
long-term goal of this work is to limit substance use related harms and facilitate academic, social, and vocational
success for college students with ADHD. The objective of this developmental project is to determine the rela-
tionship between substance use and educational outcomes among college students with rigorously defined
ADHD enrolled in 2- and 4-year institutions. A total of 100 first-time first-year college students (50 from 2-year
and 50 from 4-year institutions) will be recruited. The 2 Specific Aims are to: 1) determine the relationship
between frequency of substance use and academic functioning for first-year college students with ADHD enrolled
at 2-year and 4-year institutions and identify potential differences based on the type of institution and 2) identify
factors associated with substance use initiation, persistence, and cessation. Results will provide rich preliminary
data using both traditional assessment (e.g., interviews, rating scales) and responsive ecological momentary
assessment via the Open Dynamic Interaction Network (ODIN), a cell phone-based platform developed by the
Rural Drug Addiction Research (RDAR) Center. The study will be the first to provide longitudinal detail about
substance use among college students with ADHD across their first year and the first to include 2-year institu-
tions. Identifying differences in patterns across the 2 institution types will yield vital information for understanding
the needs of these students in settings within which they are most likely to enroll. These results will position
Project Leader Matthew Gormley to submit a competitive R01 proposal that will further advance RDAR’s mission
by identifying changes in the frequency of substance use and its’ relationship with academic functioning and
outcomes across the college careers of students with ADHD."
10708525,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (PROJECT LEADER LORENZ)
Treatment and prevention of women’s substance use lags that of men, and interventions designed for men are
often ineffective for women. Prior work has failed to account for unique contextual factors related to young
women’s substance use. Relative to men, women report greater stress-induced and cue-induced substance
cravings and are more likely to progress from first use to clinically significant substance use in a short period of
time. Also, about one-fifth of heterosexual women and one-third of bisexual women report using substances for
sexual enhancement (i.e., sex-linked substance use [SLSU]). When women frequently pair substance use with
sex, sexual desire may become a substance-related cue that triggers cravings. Finally, there is high comorbidity
of substance use disorder (SUD) with mood and anxiety disorders, which are more prevalent in women.
Comorbidity is particularly high among bisexual women, possibly due to experiences of discrimination and
internalized stigma. Mood symptoms reinforce substance use and vice versa; hence, successful intervention
requires knowing which symptoms to target to cause a beneficial “chain reaction” that disrupts the broader
symptom network. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to prevent SUD in young women at a pivotal
developmental window that sets the stage for lifelong substance use patterns. The proposed project’s objective
is to identify tractable and effective points of intervention to disrupt women’s substance cravings and escalating
substance use trajectories, with particular focus on bisexual women. The central hypothesis is that women’s
substance cravings and stress interact to reinforce the connections between SLSU and mood symptoms, which
leads to rapid increases in substance use, particularly among bisexual women. To test this hypothesis, a sample
of young heterosexual and bisexual women will be recruited to assess networks of mood symptoms and
substance use, including SLSU and cravings. Repeated survey measures will be used to estimate within-person
symptom networks with much higher accuracy and precision than traditional single-timepoint designs. Aim 1 will
identify how stress, sexual desire, and SLSU interact to drive women’s substance cravings. Aim 2 will examine
the factors most central to change in the network of women’s substance use, cravings, and mood symptoms.
Data from this study will identify how stress and sexual contexts interact to trigger women’s substance cravings,
how changes in symptom network stability predict women’s substance use trajectories, and critical factors to
tailor prevention efforts in bisexual women. These data will support Project Leader Tierney Lorenz in submitting
an R01 to test prevention-based interventions in young women who use substances. Ultimately, this will
contribute to the development of effective programs to slow women’s substance use trajectories and prevent
development of SUD, a critical area of progress within the Rural Drug Addiction Research Center’s mission."

10928197,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The Nadell lab studies the spatial mechanics and community dynamics of bacterial biofilms, using Vibrio
cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus, Escherichia coli, and their respective bacterial and viral predators as model
systems. While some marine Vibrio species cause human disease, with cholera being the most historically
important, my lab does not study virulence mechanisms or bacterial pathogenesis. Rather, we use these species
to understand the architectural and community dynamics of live biofilms at cellular resolution. Most bacteria
produce surface-bound biofilm communities in nature, but we have strikingly little understanding of how cell-cell
interactions lead to their higher order composition, architecture, and community dynamics. Since biofilm structure
and composition can contribute to their role in acute and chronic infection, understanding the mechanisms
controlling their structure and composition, and in particular how predatory viruses and bacteria attack biofilm-
dwelling cells, may lead to novel approaches to fight clinical infections. Over the next five years we will focus on
two major frontiers that have received minimal attention using cellular resolution imaging in the biofilm field thus
far. First, no work thus far has examined how temperate phages interact with biofilms at high resolution;
temperate phages can amplify and kill susceptible bacteria, but they can also integrate into the bacterial genome
and amplify passively along with the host bacterial cell. This phage life history is widely important in nature and
in host microbiota, and indeed often affects bacterial virulence. We will study in detail where and when within
biofilms these temperate phages infect and kill target bacteria, and where they integrate into the host genome.
Further, we will rigorously compare the propagation dynamics of temperate phages and lytic phages within
biofilms to understand how these fundamentally distinct life history strategies influence phage and bacterial
fitness in realistic environments. Second, the vast majority of high-resolution biofilm research has focused on
biofilms grown on glass under flow of nutrient media. Many realistic environments, including those of marine
Vibrio bacteria, are not this simple, with biofilms growing on topographically complex substrates, and with
nutrients derived directly from the underlying surface rather than the surrounding liquid media. We will explore
the consequences of these complex topographical environments by cultivating multispecies biofilms of V.
cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus growing on and consuming particles of shrimp shell chitin. This system will
permit us to study how growth in a multispecies context on naturalistic substrates influences community
architecture and dynamics. Lastly, we will rigorously test how the realistic chitin environment influences the ability
of a ubiquitous bacterial predator, Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, is able to attack and kill Vibrio prey within single
and multispecies biofilms. Our research will expand along two important new frontiers, both of which will yield
insight into how predatory viral and bacterial species kill prey bacteria dwelling in otherwise protected biofilms."

10896469,"The Na+/I- symporter (NIS) is the key plasma membrane protein that mediates active I- transport into the
thyroid, the first step in thyroid hormone biosynthesis. NIS couples the inward translocation of I- against its elec-
trochemical gradient to the inward transport of Na+ down its electrochemical gradient. NIS activity is electrogenic,
with a 2Na+:1I- stoichiometry. We have shown that NIS also transports the environmental pollutant perchlorate
(ClO4-, an inhibitor of I- transport), but electroneutrally (1Na+:1ClO4-). How does NIS translocate different sub-
strates with different stoichiometries? We discovered a high-affinity non-transport oxyanion binding site in NIS
that, when occupied by ClO4-, allosterically prevents one of the two Na+ ions from binding, changing the stoi-
chiometry of I- transport from 2Na+:1I- to 1Na+:1I-. This reduces the driving force for I- transport, markedly de-
creasing I- uptake. Thus, drinking water contaminated with ClO4- is more deleterious to human health than pre-
viously thought. A crucial question about NIS is: how can NIS efficiently transport I-, given the extremely low [I-]s
in the extracellular milieu? We have made significant progress toward solving this puzzle. Nevertheless, fully
elucidating the mechanism of transport by NIS will require extensive further computation and experimentation.
For these studies, we built NIS homology models based on the structures of two proteins with the same fold:
vSGLT and SiaT. MD simulations using these models have accurately predicted which residues play key roles
in NIS function; all predictions have been experimentally confirmed. The NIS transport cycle involves 16 species:
1 empty NIS, 3 NIS species with one ion, 3 NIS species with two ions, and 1 NIS with three ions, in the outwardly
(8 states) and the inwardly open conformation (8 states). The 16 species can be considered to be very close to
equilibrium. Therefore, the NIS mechanism can be described by determining the populations and free energies
of the 16 species. We propose to identify the residues making up the ClO4- allosteric site using MD simulations
of WT NIS and mutant NIS proteins we have shown to transport oxyanions electrogenically, not electroneutrally.
The residues suggested by the simulations to make up the allosteric site will be investigated experimentally. We
will search computationally for endogenous compounds that may bind to the allosteric site, and experimentally
test their effects on NIS activity. Having identified NIS residues that likely interact with I- in our simulations, we
will investigate them experimentally. We will use site-directed mutagenesis, transport assays and kinetics in
whole cells and in proteoliposomes reconstituted with purified NIS, electrophysiological experiments, scintillation
proximity assays, isothermal titration calorimetry, statistical thermodynamics modeling, and computational meth-
ods (MD simulations, including metadynamics) to answer the following questions (Specific Aims): 1. What is the
overall mechanism of NIS transport? That is, what are the populations and the free energies of all the species
that participate in the transport cycle? 2. Does NIS recognize I- as a hydrophobic anion? 3. What residues make
up the non-transport oxyanion allosteric site in NIS?"
10907704,"Patients treated with life-saving aminoglycoside (AG) antibiotics may experience adverse side effects of
ototoxicity – permanent hearing loss and degraded speech communication. There are critical gaps in our
understanding of individual susceptibility for ototoxicity, and access to effective tests that identify those at
higher risk. The objective of this proposal is to determine the effect of AG antibiotics on auditory function in
relation to individual measures of drug exposure in patients with cystic fibrosis. Our long-term goal is to design
improved auditory monitoring protocols to prevent hearing deficits due to ototoxicity in patients taking AG
antibiotics. This project will evaluate new methods to detect onset of ototoxicity using extended high frequency
(EHF) tests of inner ear function – otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) and digits in noise (DIN), in relation to
individualized pharmacokinetic/dynamic (PK/PD) measures of drug exposure. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most
common life-threatening genetic disease and causes persistent lung infections in childhood that are frequently
treated with AG antibiotics, thus is an important population to target for prevention of ototoxicity. This
longitudinal observational study will include CF patients treated with AG antibiotic treatments, and control
persons not treated with AGs, half of whom also have CF. Our hypothesis is that these newly developed
auditory tests can detect ototoxicity early and are related to the PK/PD models. Further, we hypothesize that
PK/PD models can predict risk for ototoxicity. Currently, most patients at risk are not monitored for ototoxic
hearing loss, primarily due to lack of availability and awareness of early detection methods, as well as
treatment alternatives that can preserve hearing. Tests that can be automated or delivered remotely via the
internet or through smartphones could fundamentally improve access to ototoxicity monitoring. The proposed
longitudinal observational design is impactful because it will provide highly translatable auditory data in relation
to advanced measures of drug exposure. The clinically relevant aims will: (1) Assess relationships over time
between cumulative doses of AGs, shifts in EHF pure tone and DIN tests, and self-reported hearing difficulty
and tinnitus; (2) Compare OAE tests to hearing loss shifts and determine which OAE test is more accurate to
detect presence of ototoxicity; (3) Develop a clinical PK/PD tool to predict AG ototoxicity (change in
audiometry, DIN or OAEs) in relation to AG tissue accumulation in CF patients. The expected outcomes will
have important positive impacts because they will provide a better understanding of ototoxicity mechanisms,
timing and risk factors that can be translated into improved monitoring. Future genomic studies and clinical
trials to protect the inner ear would be facilitated by this expanded knowledge and by availability of improved
diagnostic and monitoring tools."

 Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) affects up to half of extremely preterm infants, and is associated
with significant adverse respiratory, developmental, educational, and health economic outcomes. The NICHD
Neonatal Research Network (NRN) Hydrocortisone for BPD Trial has enrolled 652 of a planned total of 800
preterm infants at high risk for BPD in a placebo controlled trial of hydrocortisone (HC). The proposed
“Hydrocortisone for BPD Respiratory and Developmental (HYBRiD) Outcomes Study” builds on this ongoing
clinical trial to characterize the functional respiratory and developmental outcomes of this established
trial population at 5 years corrected age, or early school age. Functional assessments, which cannot be
performed before early school age, provide parents and schools with a realistic picture of a child's strengths
and challenges in every day scenarios, so that appropriate services can be provided to prevent school failure.
 This proposed trial follow-up takes advantage of (1) a large, well-described, trial population of children
who had severe neonatal lung disease and are being followed until 2 years corrected age; (2) the support of
the NRN infrastructure, (3) the NRN's superb track records in school age trial follow-up and collaboration with
NHLBI, and (4) the long-standing successful relationship between the NRN Data Coordinating Center (DCC) at
RTI and the Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) and NRN investigators. The CCC and DCC both have
extensive expertise and experience in the conduct and follow-up of large neonatal clinical trials.
 The HYBRiD Outcomes Study will use novel functional assessments of early school age developmental
and respiratory outcomes to assess the impact of both HC exposure and severity of lung disease. The primary
outcome of functional impairment is defined as any one of four outcomes that can be measured directly in the
child: cognitive delay, motor impairment, academic delay, or poor functional exercise capacity as measured by
the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). The HYBRiD Outcome Study specific aims are, within the NRN HC for BPD
Trial at 5 years corrected age, to evaluate: (1) the impact of HC exposure on rates of functional impairment;
and (2) the relationship between severity of BPD (based on the categorical NIH consensus definition of BPD)
and functional impairment. The HYBRiD Outcome Study's functional respiratory outcomes, which are novel in
this population, will be validated with impulse oscillometry in the participants at a subset of centers.
 Supported unanimously by the NRN, this study will address several critical knowledge gaps about the
early school age outcomes of children with neonatal respiratory failure, based on both the severity of BPD and
exposure to HC, as well as the relationships between respiratory and developmental outcomes. These results
will have immediate impact on counseling of parents in the neonatal intensive care unit and management of
neonates in the unit and after discharge. In addition, these data will be essential for the development of future
intervention studies aimed to improve the long-term outcomes of preterm infants with respiratory failure."

Neuronascent (NNI) discovered a unique therapy for Alzheimer’s, NNI-362, that promotes adult-
born neurons to replace lost neurons, while protecting from degeneration. In NNI’s completed
Phase1a trial, NNI-362 demonstrated safety and significant reduction of brain phosphoTau181.
The aim is to follow up the Ph1a with a Phase 2 trial in AD, for which the following 4 specific
aims are necessary. 1) NNI requires further GMP manufacture and 2) liquid-gel cap formulation
of NNI-362; 3) the long-term (6-months) safety in M/F rats and dogs; and 4) regular IND updates
and a meeting with FDA to discuss the Phase 2 clinical plan. This unique drug could be
beneficial for AD by limiting phosphoTau pathology and promoting new neurons to reverse
disease over a six-month period.
In the first aim, Onyx Scientific will scale-up NNI-362 from the 1 kg cGMP method used for
Phase 1a, to the >5 kg cGMP required for completion of Phase 2-3. Secondly, NNI-362 clinical
product will then be formulated into a liquid-gel capsule prepared at 120 mg/capsule, already
shown safe and potentially efficacious in aged subjects. Patheon prepared the formulation used
in Phase1a, and determined the practicality of the liquid-gel cap with NNI-362.
Thirdly, Charles River will complete a dog and rat (M/F) GLP safety testing for 6-months, as
required by FDA for treatment of humans for the same 6-month period. The doses will be the
same as the completed 14day/14day washout study in rats at 10, 50 and 150 mg/kg and in dogs
at 15, 45 and 210 mg/kg po daily. Charles River has considerable experience in carrying out
FDA-approved GLP safety studies. Lastly, regulatory contractors CCS Associates will provide
yearly regulatory IND-update filings and will request a FDA meeting to discuss the Phase 2
clinical trial plan for mild to moderate AD patients.
With decades of AD drug failures, NNI used human neural cell screen to discover a “neuron
generating and neuroprotective” drug. Pre-clinical studies of NNI-362 demonstrated new
hippocampal neurons in aging and disease models, and neuroprotection to allow new neuron
integration that reversed behavioral deficits. Phase 1a in healthy aged subjects demonstrated
safety and indicated that NNI-362, provided significant reduction of AD-progression marker
phosphoTau181 after only 16 days of treatment period in human aged subjects. With longer term
treatment of AD patients, NNI-362 has the potential to not only slow progression of AD over the
short-term, but promote new neurons to fully reverse disease, long-term."

Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) experience a progressive disease course and bear a
substantial symptomatic burden, marked by heart failure, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias and early mortality.
Patients with symptomatic HCM, but without obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract (so-called non-
obstructive HCM), are a particular challenge to manage, as no treatments have proven effective at improving
symptoms or impacting the trajectory of disease progression. This proposal will focus on sodium-glucose
cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) as a potential therapeutic option for non-obstructive HCM. Initially
developed as hypoglycemic drugs to treat type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), SGLT2i unexpectedly conferred a
remarkable cardioprotective benefit with robust reductions in cardiovascular mortality and hospitalizations for
heart failure, irrespective of diabetic status or ejection fraction. While the mechanisms of action by which
SGLT2i are exerting such beneficial cardiovascular effects are still unclear, an improvement in cardiac
energetics has been proposed as one plausible mechanism based on evidence for increased cardiac ketone
oxidation and ATP content in preclinical models of heart failure. The overall goal of this study is to determine
the safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of SGLT2i in patients with non-obstructive HCM. The rationale
for conducting this study is based on the similarities between non-obstructive HCM and heart failure with
preserved ejection fraction, and also the unique structural and functional features of HCM that make an early
phase trial essential before implementation of larger phase clinical trials or adoption of “off label” use. We will
perform a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study of the SGLT2i dapagliflozin vs placebo in 26 patients
with non-obstructive HCM and ejection fraction >50%. Our primary safety outcomes will be rhythm monitoring
and intracavitary left ventricular gradients assessed by echocardiography. Our preliminary efficacy endpoints
will be change in peak oxygen consumption (VO2), left ventricular systolic and diastolic function by
echocardiography, NT-proBNP, ambulatory actigraphy, and quality of life assessment. In an exploratory aim,
we will test whether SGLT2i improve cardiac energetics in HCM using 31P-MR spectroscopy to quantify
relative amounts of myocardial energy stores, specifically phosphocreatine and ATP. This early phase study
seeks to extend the marked cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2i recently demonstrated for heart failure with
reduced and preserved ejection fraction, to patients with HCM. The study team includes investigators with a
strong track record in early phase clinical trials in HCM, at a high volume HCM center at the University of
Pennsylvania, in collaboration with experienced clinician investigators in endocrinology and radiology at the
Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania. The results of this study will provide essential preliminary data to
determine if larger scale clinical trials of SGLT2i in HCM should be pursued, and explore a shift in metabolic
substrate utilization as a potential mechanism of action of conferred benefit."

Commensal and pathogenic bacteria inhabit various oxygen-depleted niches in the human body, such as the
gastrointestinal tract, wound tissue, and the lung mucosa. Adaptation to these environments requires distinct
anaerobic biochemistry to support colonization and survival. An understanding of these biochemical strategies
could present unique opportunities to develop novel therapeutics that overcome challenges of antibiotic
resistance and bacterial persistence. However, we lack fundamental knowledge of the diverse chemistry that
microbes use in anaerobic and microaerobic environments. The proposed studies outline our approach to
elucidate the molecular mechanisms, biochemical reactions, and biological roles of metalloenzymes in host-
microbe interactions. Metalloenzymes play central roles in cellular redox chemistry. Whereas classes of
metalloenzymes that active oxygen for redox reactions have been studied for decades, metalloenzyme families
that function in the absence of oxygen remain poorly characterized. In this project, we interrogate the chemical
and biological functions of a newly discovered family of metalloenzyme oxidases that are prevalent in bacterial
pathogens and human gut microbes. The few known representatives of this family catalyze oxygen-independent
hydroxylation reactions in key cellular processes, including cofactor biosynthesis and RNA modification. We will
use these known enzymes to establish the requirements for catalysis and to discern their postulated roles in
microoxic conditions. Beyond the members with established functions, emerging metalloenzyme families also
represent an untapped source of biochemical diversity. We will leverage genomics and protein bioinformatics to
discover new enzymatic chemistry within this poorly characterized superfamily. The proposed work will reveal
previously unknown redox chemistry, establish biochemical responses to microaerobic conditions, and set the
stage to interrogate the importance of these reactions in host-microbe interactions. The ultimate goal of this
research program is to gain a molecular understanding of microbial adaptation to O2 limitation that can be
leveraged to treat elusive drug-resistant bacterial pathogens."

As much as 50% of primate genomes are comprised of transposable elements (TEs). While these elements
were originally thought to be junk DNA, newer technologies and approaches have provided insight into how TEs
can contribute to molecular and organismal phenotypes. Given their current or previous ability to move within
host genomes, TEs have the potential to exert both beneficial and deleterious effects on the organism by
contributing gene regulatory sequence. Indeed, TEs can generate gene regulatory innovation leading to
evolutionary novelty and adaptation, while TE mis-regulation associates with various diseases including cancer.
Despite the prevalence of TEs we understand relatively little about how millions of these elements in the human
genome contribute to genome function and expression. Our overarching hypothesis is that TEs exert their gene
regulatory effects in specific environmental contexts. To begin to dissect human TE regulation, this proposal will
make use of evolutionary functional genomics approaches in a cell culture model derived from human individuals
and our closest evolutionary relatives the chimpanzee. In support of our hypothesis, our previous work, together
with that of many others, has indicated that TEs can indeed be regulated through chromatin modifications, DNA
methylation and transcription factor binding. We have also shown that gene expression is dynamic in response
to the environment within and between species, which supports the role of the non-coding genome in mediating
phenotypic effects through gene regulation. We have taken advantage of a flexible induced pluripotent stem cell
(iPSC) based system to generate cell types that can be carefully perturbed, allowing for gene regulatory and
cellular responses to be determined and correlated. In this proposal we will use iPSC technology applied to a
panel of human and chimpanzee individuals, together with functional genomics and cellular assays to dissect
the role of transposable elements in mediating phenotypic effects. First, we will investigate TE regulatory
dynamics during lineage commitment by asking: 1) How do TEs contribute to cell type specification in primates?
and 2) How do TEs contribute to germ layer specification in primates? Second, we will investigate the evolution
of TE regulatory dynamics in response to cellular stress by asking 3) How do stress responses evolve in
primates? and 4) Do TEs contribute to stress responses in primates? Our research will result in an understanding
of the potential for TEs to act as regulatory sequence in the genome that may only be revealed in particular cell
states, or in response to perturbation. This may ultimately provide insight into how aberrant regulation of, and by
TEs can contribute to disease states."

This R16 grant application proposes to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying apoptosis of periodontal
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) induced by exposure to Porphyromanas gingivalis (Pg). Periodontitis is an
inflammatory bone resorption lesion caused by dysbiosis of the periodontal microbiome. A critical pathologic
manifestation of periodontitis is the irreversible loss of connective tissue and alveolar bone which, in part, results
from the regulated cell death of fibroblasts and osteoblasts. It is well established that periodontal fibroblasts and
osteoblasts are differentiated from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) present in the periodontium. However, it is
largely unknown whether MSCs in periodontal tissue can also be affected by regulated cell death and diminish
the regenerative potential. Therefore, the long-term goal of the proposed study is to understand the molecular
mechanism underlying the retarded regeneration of connective tissue and alveolar bone in periodontitis by
targeting the regulated cell death induced in GMSCs, leading to the development of a therapeutic prevention
strategy.
Our preliminary data indicate that the keystone oral pathogen P. gingivalis (Pg), but not other periodontal
bacteria, can cause atypical cell death of periodontal MSCs, but not epithelial cells, as characterized by the
extracellular release of decondensed chromatin contents. Emerging studies have revealed that only neutrophils
and macrophages die via the release of decondensed chromatin contents (DNA, Histone and HMGB1) in
response to stimulation with
TLR ligands. This phenomenon termed as “Neutrophil Extracellular Trap Death
[=osis] (NETosis)” is known to elicit inflammation in several diseases, including sepsis, cancer, and autoimmune
diseases. We herein for the first time termed such Stem cell Extracellular Chromatin release Death (SECosis).
According to our results, exposure of THP1 cells (human monocytic cell line) to SECosis products elevated the
production of IL-1β compared to that of Pg alone or GMSCs alone, suggesting the proinflammatory potential of
SECosis. It is established that a eukaryote enzyme peptidyl arginine deiminase (PAD) plays a role in eliciting the
NETosis by Histone H3 citrullination that untangles the chromatin. Interestingly is described that among the
periodontal bacteria, only Pg produces PAD. We showed Stimulation of GMSCs with (PAD)-knockout Pg
diminished induction of IL-1β from THP1 indicating that Pg-PAD may be engaged in the induction of extracellular
release of decondensed chromatin contents. This hypothesis will be assessed in the following Aims: (Aim1) To
establish the property of Pg, and the role of Pg-PAD, in the induction of SECosis. (Aim2) To elucidate the
molecular mechanism underlying the SECosis-mediated IL-1β production by monocytes. This study will elucidate
role of Pg in the regulated cell death specifically induced in GMSCs, in turn retarding the regenerative potential
of periodontal tissue."

Optical imaging enables fast and minimally invasive observation of biological processes within living cells and
organisms. However, current state-of-the-art imaging instruments have limitations in acquisition speed, spatial resolution
and light-penetration depth that restrict the types of biological questions that can be addressed. This is particularly
problematic for biological samples that span several orders of magnitude in spatiotemporal scale. For example, cell-cell
interactions within the tumor microenvironment and their response to treatment can occur over seconds to days and be
heterogeneous throughout an entire tissue volume. Coupling these physiological outcomes to the underlying molecular
mechanisms (and potential therapeutic targets) requires a transformation in not only the technologies we use, but also the
combination of methods to cross the spatiotemporal scales from cells to tissues. Recent developments in emerging
techniques like cleared-tissue-imaging coupled with lightsheet microscopy (LSM) has enabled researchers to probe deeper
into the tissue without needing to section them. Illumination with lightsheet offers a much faster and less phototoxic
alternative in comparison to point scanning microscopes. However, all LSM (including Lattice lightsheet) struggled with a
number of fundamental limitations: (a) the maximum number of possible labels that can be imaged, (b) the size of the
samples that they can handle, and, (c) poor spatial and temporal resolution. In order to fill these gaps my research program
will engineer new optics that will not only improve the spatiotemporal resolution of the current state-of-the-art but also
enable researchers to probe multiple simultaneous cellular phenotypes within the 3D architecture of the tissue
microenvironment. By employing multiple scanning lightsheets we will develop a large volume hyperspectral LSM that
will be able to unmix (segmentation and classification) 12+ fluorophores and image at 300 nm XYZ resolution to quantify
the complex spatiotemporal interactions between various cell-types in tissue microenvironment. Additionally, we will
develop a next generation LSM that will provide users a seamless transition from an organ/organism level imaging to 300
nm XYZ resolution. It will be proficient in identifying events-of-interest at lower resolution in large organs and
intelligently adapt to high-resolution imaging, thus reducing imaging-time and generated-data burden. We will also design
a new sample scanning strategy that will minimize light loss within the tissues. In order to prevent out-of-focus blur while
imaging inside the tissue we will implement an autofocus routine that will enable users to carry out prolonged and
unsupervised imaging of large specimens. Finally, we will develop a lattice lightsheet fluorescence microscope that will
be able to perform fast, high-resolution multicolor imaging of live cells and spheroids. A configurable emission path will
augment LSM with adaptive optics to counter sample induced aberrations. This will allow us to dynamically observe and
quantify morphological phenotypes characteristic for highly metastatic cancer cells, which will be staged in organoids. I
believe these have the potential to determine statistically significant patterns within the intact tissue that are bound to
uncover novel biological questions."
10898031,"Project Summary/Abstract
Retrieving biomedical articles from bibliographic databases requires accurate, detailed indexing of the topics
that are discussed as well as their publication types and study designs. It is difficult for indexers to keep up with
manual assignments in view of the explosion of published literature. Although NLM has recently employed
automatic machine learning methods to index articles according to the major topics discussed, there is still no
automatic means of indexing each article across all publication types and study designs. We have recently
created a working prototype tool, Multi-Tagger, which has assigned probabilistic predictive scores for all
PubMed articles for 50 different publication types and study designs (collectively, PTs). We now propose to
develop Multi-Tagger 2.0, to handle a wider variety of study designs, articles, users and use cases, and to
ensure that the data are disseminated in a form that is appropriate to each different type of user. Specifically,
we aim to:
Aim 1. Optimize methods for assigning Publication Types and study designs to both PubMed and non-
PubMed biomedical articles, preprints and manuscripts.
Aim 2. Evaluate PTs in detail, taking into account model performance, use cases and users.
Aim 3. Optimize dissemination of PT predictive scores by query interface and API.
Aim 4. Explore how to integrate Multi-Tagger with other tools for automating evidence synthesis.
The proposed studies will greatly enhance retrieval of relevant articles and preprints across multiple
databases, and will be useful for a wide range of biomedical end-users (clinicians, researchers, students and
journal editors) as well as user groups including systematic review groups, bibliographic database managers,
those studying preclinical animal models of human disease, and pharmaceutical companies developing new
drug treatments. Improving the infrastructure of the biomedical literature will thus indirectly impact on human
health."
10908683,"Despite recent improvements in some area of health, Oklahoma continues to have high rates of tobacco and
substance use, obesity, cancer and cardiovascular deaths, arthritis disability and poor overall health choices.
The mission of the OSCTR Pilot Projects Program is to accelerate discoveries into Oklahoma’s health priorities
by fostering innovative and collaborative clinical and translational research (CTR) projects, leading to nationally
and federally funded independent research programs. Our program has funded 50 pilot projects with >50%
female and 20% of these PIs from under-represented minority populations. These pilot recipients have been
immensely successful garnering more than $90M of PI-level extramural funding to these new investigators,
including more than $10M annual federal funding. This program provides pilot project funding (Aim 1),
coordinates infrastructure support and mentoring for pilot investigators (Aim 2), and identifies promising but
unfunded junior investigators for additional mentoring (Aim 3). This strategy is built on the hypothesis that
providing junior investigators with CTR funding, infrastructure, and mentorship will coalesce a new generation
of well-trained, well-funded CTR scientists equipped to translate scientific discoveries into improved clinical
care and patient well-being. The Pilot program prioritizes research that addresses prominent health issues in
Oklahoma and other IDeA states. Building on early successes and being responsive to needs identified by past
pilots, EAC and Evaluation Core feedback, the program is increasing its administrative support to Pilot PIs to
provide more mentoring in grant management skills. It is continuing to offer two award types: CTR Pilot Awards
provide 12 months of funding for at least five novel research projects per year; Pilot Sustainability Bridge
Awards can provide 6 additional months of funding for up to 2 pilot recipients per year to address the need for
interim support while analyzing, publishing, and seeking extramural funding for their projects. We encourage
Pilot projects that support the unique needs of our partners with partnerships that include non-academic
institutions, such as tribal institutions, community development agencies, county health improvement
organizations, and primary care providers. In addition to these OSCTR-funded awards, the program leverages
other local funding programs when possible to provide larger or additional awards in each category. Beyond
providing financial support, the program had demonstrably demonstrated that it provides an environment that
nurtures the success of these junior investigators. Annual Pilot initiation meetings will introduce awardees to
the OSCTR Cores, Directors, and other awardees. Throughout the award, investigators will receive structured
mentoring (Professional Development Core) and training in scientific writing to foster career development and
growth toward independence, including peer mentoring through proposal critique opportunities. The program
continues to assist current and past awardees, as well as promising but unfunded applicants, to identify
additional funding sources and develop a strategy for securing independent, national funding."
10908688,"The OSCTR Professional Development (ProfDev) Core is essential to addressing the Oklahoma Shared
Clinical and Translational Resources (OSCTR) goals of mentoring new and early-stage investigators across
the clinical and translational research (CTR) pipeline to independence, providing training and mentoring of
CTR scientists to focus on the health issues of our populations, and building capacity for CTR research within
our community partners. During the first funding cycle, the ProfDev Core supported programs that provided
mentored training opportunities spanning summer research experiences for undergraduate and
graduate/professional students to a master’s degree in clinical and translational science (CTS). In addition, we
developed the Translating Practice into Research program, providing intensive CTR training to rural, academic,
and tribal clinicians from Oklahoma and other IDeA states to increase their ability to be valuable members of
productive, multi-disciplinary research teams. In the current cycle, we added an online Certificate in CTS
program, benefiting those who cannot travel to Oklahoma City for courses regularly. Throughout these two
cycles, the mission of the Core has evolved to prioritize increasing mentoring capacity and effectiveness in the
state. We recently established the Oklahoma Center for Mentoring Excellence (OCME), allowing the OSCTR to
enhance the development of CTR researchers and provide a formal mentor training program to support the
capacity-building missions of the IDeA programs in the region. OCME activities have included workshops
tailored to broad audiences of individuals interested in developing their mentoring skills, which have been
attended by more than 200 faculty members and provided the training and experience needed to effectively
guide the professional development of CTR investigators. The OCME has provided a validated mentoring
framework for junior investigators supported by the OSCTR. With this renewal, we will utilize this pool of
certified mentors to provide targeted, one-on-one research and career development support to OSCTR
Scholars. The ProfDev Core will continue to build on institutional efforts to increase the competitiveness of our
clinical investigators for NIH career development awards and provide additional mentoring to active K-award
recipients. The ProfDev Core will continue to support successful educational efforts of the OSCTR that
increase the ability of our rural and community members to access training resources, including the Certificate
program. This includes new support for the development of a CTR education and training online toolkit within
the Gateway to Research in Oklahoma portal that will provide a consolidated site for dissemination of content
produced across the OSCTR Cores, including training videos, presentations, and tip sheets focused on
clinicians, research staff, and community stakeholders. Together, these activities will assist our supported
Scholars, Mentors, Investigators, and Partners in developing more effective clinical and translational research
programs and increase our overall capacity to address the major health problems that affect our population."

Recent technological advances have enabled the production of vast amounts of diverse multi-omics data types (e.g.,
genomics, epigenomics, proteomics, transcriptomics) of complex diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases
and neurodegenerative disorders. The integration of multi-omics data from those heterogeneous diseases can help
in unraveling the underlying biological mechanisms at multiple omics data levels, in improving prediction of clinical
outcomes, and to transform medicine, but at the same time presents significant challenges to identify important
biomarkers from a large size of heterogeneous molecular data points (i.e. hundreds of thousands). We will
develop and apply novel and powerful Bayesian statistical learning methods that will capture linear and nonlinear
relationships of multi-omics data. The methods will be used to identify i) important predictive pathways and
their corresponding important molecules; ii) clinically meaningful molecular disease subtypes, and iii) predictive
and prognostic biomarkers that contribute to the joint association (or regulatory networks) between omics data
types. The proposed method will be applied to multiple publicly available datasets such as The Cancer Genome
Atlas, dbGAP, and Genotype-Tissue Expression, and to non public data sets obtained from our collaborators. We
will develop robust, computationally efficient, and user-friendly software free of charge for the application of our
methods."
10908678,"The primary mission of the Oklahoma Shared Clinical and Translational Resources (OSCTR) is to improve
health by catalyzing clinical and translational research (CTR) that addresses the top health concerns
experienced in the state. The OSCTR integrates health professionals, investigators, and scientific resources at
more than 30 public, private, and tribal partners statewide to fulfill its mission. Several features make
Oklahoma an ideal setting to continue and expand these efforts, including high rates of chronic diseases and
large rural and tribal populations where improved outcomes may serve as models across IDeA states.
Oklahomans have the sixth lowest life expectancy in the US, with widening disparities for American Indians
and rural populations leading to early mortality. Cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and
autoimmunity are top causes of enhanced morbidity or disability and are exacerbated by high rates of tobacco
and other substance abuse and low rates of routine health screening and healthy life choices. Research on the
health priorities and health equity of our tribal and other underserved populations has been fostered by strong
relationships between research institutions and tribal nations and rural communities. The OSCTR has helped
build a growing and diverse cadre of investigators who have launched independent CTR careers and is broadly
supported by institutional leaders committed to CTR and improving Oklahomans’ health. The OSCTR houses a
highly productive Clinical Resources Core with a CAP-certified biorepository and cutting-edge resources for
clinical data research. Concurrent with these strengths, the OSCTR has leveraged partnerships to build
networks for practice-based research to help speed the adoption of evidence-based practices in patient care.
Despite our successes, the sustainability of CTR research in Oklahoma and its impact on public health are
limited by ongoing needs for infrastructure support and clinical research investigators. To support rural and
tribal health equity, the OSCTR will assist tribal health systems in building CTR infrastructure, foster
interactions via the Tribal Engagement Unit, and expand research with community organizations to address
social determinants of health and increase opportunities for clinical trial participation. We will continue to
support the development of junior investigators from many disciplines by providing training, mentoring, pilot
grants, biostatistics/epidemiology expertise, access to patient samples and clinical data, study recruitment and
regulatory assistance, and comprehensive online resources. We will engage health professionals, communi-
ties, and patients in high-priority CTR through an online portal and existing networks of community-oriented
health improvement organizations. We will continue work with Oklahoma IDeA programs and the national
IDeA-CTR network to develop and share effective infrastructure and increase opportunities for Oklahomans to
participate in cutting-edge research. Together, these activities will grow and sustain a critical mass of investi-
gators and vital infrastructure enhanced by federal funding, industry clinical trials, and other local support."
10908692,"Effective clinical and translational research (CTR) requires rigorous study designs, appropriate application of
analytic methods, and careful reporting. The Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design (BERD) has
been instrumental in expanding clinical and translational research with new investigators, community partners,
and programs of the OSCTR supporting more than 1000 research projects since the OSCTR was established.
The BERD has enhanced research methods training, expanded the use of novel analytic methods and
research, and helped build research infrastructure through clinical informatics support, enhancement of
REDCap infrastructure, and growth of the survey center established by the OSCTR. The mission of the BERD
Core is to enable OSCTR investigators and partner institutions to design, perform, and report rigorous,
reproducible, and innovative studies that can be applied to improve clinical care and patient well-being in
Oklahoma and other IDeA states. To do this, the BERD Core will provide consultative expertise in biostatistics,
epidemiology, qualitative research, and survey design methods; deliver methodologic training, analytic tools,
and learning resources; and develop and apply novel research designs and analytic methods focused on the
needs of OSCTR researchers. BERD Core members will continue to collaborate with investigators through the
spectrum of basic medical science laboratory research, preclinical studies, randomized controlled clinical trials,
translational studies, dissemination and implementation studies, and community-based studies. It will help
investigators address sources of bias, identify sufficient sample sizes, select measurement instruments,
perform data quality control, manage and analyze data, and report study results. A new BERD initiative will
establish the Design and Computational Resources Unit to provide training tools and resources in
epidemiologic research design and analysis of health data. The multimedia and computational tools will cover
a range of introductory to advanced topics in research design and biostatistical analyses and be made
available on the Gateway to Research in Oklahoma portal. Finally, to advance biostatistics and epidemiologic
methods, the BERD Core will hold monthly seminars to disseminate novel research designs, analysis methods,
and research findings and perform methodological research to adapt existing methods or develop new
approaches to address research questions – for example, by developing new statistical methods to reduce
bias and increase estimation efficiency in small populations, such as American Indian tribes. Together, these
BERD Core activities enable OSCTR investigators to perform rigorous, reproducible, and innovative research
to better understand and address health needs in Oklahoma."
10908704,"Although some improvement has been made since the Oklahoma Shared Clinical and Translational Resources
(OSCTR) initiation, Oklahoma remains consistently in or near the bottom 10% of states for the overall health of
its population. Oklahoma’s residents disproportionately suffer from chronic health problems, such as obesity,
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and arthritis/autoimmunity. Oklahomans have a life expectancy of 4 years
shorter than the average US citizen, while American Indians have a life expectancy of more than 7 years
shorter than other groups within the US. With high percentages of rural (34%) and tribal (16%) populations,
Oklahoma has unique challenges and opportunities to implement clinical and translational research (CTR)
projects and dissemination and implementation research to improve health and disease outcomes. The Clinical
Resources (ClinRes) Core of the OSCTR has built a centralized system to support human subjects research
focused on these issues. The Core provides clinical research facilities and staff to assist with participant
recruitment and regulatory approvals, a CAP-certified Biorepository that has allowed the OSCTR to adopt or
establish registries, repositories, and cohorts to assist investigators in obtaining and utilizing high-quality
samples to support their research efforts, and infrastructure for accessing de-identified patient data to support
clinical research projects. These efforts have allowed the Core to support the careers of multiple CTR
investigators, including researchers who are members of the under-represented minority communities in the
state. The ClinRes Core will continue to provide this invaluable access to sample collections while supporting
the establishment and growth of new repositories focusing on the health issues of greatest concern to our
populations, including cancer, diabetes, and arthritis. The ClinRes core will continue to work with the
Community Engagement and Outreach (CEO) Core to build on the strong relationships developed with smaller
community organizations across the state during the COVID-19 pandemic. Together, these collaborations
enhance the overall opportunities of our CTR investigators to expand clinical study and trial access to residents
throughout the state to help increase participant diversity and address our rural and minority health disparities.
The ClinRes Core will continue to provide junior investigators with essential assistance with institutional IRB
applications, protocols, data safety monitoring boards, and other regulatory requirements and will work with the
Administrative Core to make access to resources and information more accessible to investigators, clinicians,
clinical research staff, and participants through the Gateway to Oklahoma portal. With the CEO Tribal
Engagement Unit, we will assist investigators in working with the Indian Health Service and tribal IRBs,
ensuring the protection of both individual human subjects and tribal community populations. Finally, we will
continue developing and supporting resources to grow our clinical research informatics capacity to facilitate
local and national research efforts."

Interdisciplinary research in Immunology, Inflammation and Infectious Disease affects a wide variety of human
diseases and has been fostered at the University of Utah via a campus-wide research initiative. In connection
with these efforts, the Immunology, Inflammation and Infectious Disease (3i) Training Program seeks to bring
together faculty and trainees across the University of Utah Health campus to foster collaborative research in
basic and translational immunology. This application is the recipient of substantial institutional backing and
requests support for 5 pre-doctoral trainees. The main component of the 3i Training Program is individualized
research training under the guidance of 37 well-funded faculty members in 8 departments across campus,
comprising 11 research divisions. Pre-doctoral trainees who have completed their qualifying exam are eligible
for up to 2 years of support. Trainees are selected by the Steering Committee from a large and highly competitive
pool of candidates based on prior research excellence, a research proposal and letters of recommendation. It
is anticipated that as part of their normal graduate education, trainees will complete their coursework, participate
in seminars and retreats, present their research in departmental settings, write a thesis proposal, perform thesis
research, publish results and defend their thesis research. In addition, the Training Program will enhance
graduate education through the following activities: 1) a one-month immunology rotation at ARUP, the national
pathology reference laboratory affiliated with the University of Utah; 2) formal training in grant-writing, leading to
submission of an extramural grant proposal; 3) support for travel to present data at scientific meetings; 4) monthly
publishing workshop with other Training Program trainees and mentors; 5) interaction with invited seminar
speakers; 6) annual presentation of research at the M&I retreat or 3i symposium; 7) guidance in the effective
utilization of Individual Development Plans (IDPs); and 8) formal mentoring in research ethics, including the
design and implementation of rigorous and reproducible research projects. Given the exceptional training track
record of our faculty, available resources to support research and robust institutional support, the 3i Training
Program will provide an ideal platform to train the next generation of human disease-focused immunologists."
10881990,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cells tightly regulate secreted signaling proteins so that they function at the right place and time. Most signaling
proteins form complexes with other signals in various combinations. This mix-and-match strategy is deployed in
all stages of metazoan evolution, ultimately enabling cell type diversity and complex animal behaviors. But what
are the molecular rules that govern the formation of signaling ligands? The overarching goal of my research
program is to describe the fundamental mechanisms of signal assembly and processing, as well as to provide
solutions when signaling goes awry. The first arm of the program investigates transforming growth factor-beta
signaling proteins, Vg1 and Nodal, that must assemble as heterodimers to properly induce the mesoderm and
endoderm tissues (e.g., muscle, bone, blood). We recently discovered that several chaperones aid in the robust
and selective assembly of Vg1-Nodal heterodimers in animal embryos. This finding has opened fundamental
mechanistic questions on chaperone-mediated signal assembly: What are the molecular rules (and the order of
these rules) that chaperones use to control the composition of signaling complexes? We will combine
embryological manipulation, biochemical reconstitution in vitro, and computational modeling to identify the
protein regulators and binding motifs that govern the heteromeric assembly of signaling proteins. In the second
arm of the program, we aim to assign the true physiological function of endogenous peptides. For example, a
single polyprotein-encoding gene can produce up to eight bioactive peptides. However, cells only use a handful
of convertases to process the thousands of secreted precursor proteins and peptides. In our previous work, we
established a new molecular approach to process secreted proteins, the Synthetic Processing (Synpro) system.
The Synpro system is composed of a family of secreted, synthetic proteases that can cleave cognate sequences
on any secreted protein. We will further develop these novel secreted proteases to cleave secreted polyproteins
in a sequence-specific way. Using the Synpro system, our lab will assign peptide function in two ways: (i)
introduction of Synpro-cleavable sequences into polyproteins or (ii) directed evolution of Synpro proteases to
process the natural sequence of each peptide within a polyprotein. Diversifying the cleavage sequence alphabet
of Synpro proteases will enable us to assign peptide function, deconstruct complex behaviors, and disrupt
diseases that arise from secreted signaling proteins."
10863856,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over the past few decades, our knowledge of the mechanisms by which cells interact with drugs and toxins has
exploded due to new molecular analysis techniques and the application of genomic methods. Accordingly, the
emphasis of graduate education in the disciplines of pharmacology and toxicology needs to shift from a
reductionist view to a systems approach in which doctoral students are comprehensively trained so they can
formulate a strategy to solve important biological questions not only at the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels
but also at the whole-animal level. Systems pharmacology and toxicology describes a field of study that considers
the broad view of drug action. A systems approach using in vivo animal models is necessary to establish efficacy,
safety and the pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic profile of candidate drugs but there is a shortage of students
trained in this area. This Training in Systems Pharmacology and Toxicology (T-SPaT) Program is designed for
PhD students in their second year of graduate study pursuing dissertation research projects in the
pharmacological sciences. Trainees (2/year for up to 2 years of support) and 33 Program faculty are drawn from
the Graduate Program in Interdisciplinary Biomedical Sciences (GPIBS) and the MD/PhD Program. The T-SPaT
program will train students to use an in vivo approach to answering relevant questions in pharmacology and
toxicology with emphasis on metabolism, drug design, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and signaling.
The rationale for the T-SPaT program is that this type of training will provide students with a much broader
perspective on pharmacology and toxicology that will better prepare them to conduct safe, ethical and rigorous
research as leaders of multidisciplinary research teams in the pharmacological sciences. We will integrate T-
SPaT into PhD training programs already active at our graduate training sites in the Little Rock area that include
faculty/scientists in the Colleges of Medicine, Pharmacy, and Public Health on the UAMS, the Arkansas
Children’s Hospital campus, and at the Food and Drug Administration-funded National Center for Toxicological
Research. The unique focus of T-SPaT is training with in vivo systems pharmacological and toxicological
approaches and concepts. The objective of T-SPaT is to provide in vivo pharmacology and toxicology training
that complement the cellular and molecular training that students receive in their home programs. The training
program consists of didactic training in pharmacology, toxicology, physiology, pharmacokinetics, metabolism,
biostatistics, grant writing, and the Responsible Conduct of Research along with laboratory research using an in
vivo model of human disease. The T-SPaT program will also provide strong mentoring, extensive networking,
and teaching and leadership opportunities for its trainees through its programmatic activities."
10720902,"This is a Mentored Physician-Scientist Award in Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD)
application for Dr. Molly Horstman, a hospitalist and health services researcher at the Michael E. DeBakey VA
Medical Center, who is establishing herself as a young investigator at the intersection of hospital medicine,
dementia, and caregiving. This award will provide Dr. Horstman with the necessary support (1) to develop
expertise in ADRD and dementia caregiving, (2) to receive formal training in implementation science research
methods, and (3) to gain the experience needed to establish herself as an independent physician-scientist. To
achieve these goals, Dr. Horstman has assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of nationally recognized
investigators in ADRD, Dementia Caregiving, Geriatrics, and Implementation Science research methods.
 Hospital admissions are sentinel events for Veterans with ADRD and their family caregivers. Adults with
ADRD are often discharged from the hospital with new functional and cognitive limitations, which increases
demands on family caregivers following discharge. These changing caregiver demands increase caregiver
stress, which can lead to worse outcomes for caregivers and care recipients. Over 20 years of research has
demonstrated that care transitions interventions started in the hospital can improve outcomes for patients.
Furthermore, care transitions interventions started in the hospital and designed specifically to meet the needs
of stroke caregivers have been shown to reduce caregiver burden and anxiety and reduce acute care resource
use following discharge. To date, this evidence base supporting tailored interventions to meet specific
caregiver needs has not been translated to the support for dementia caregivers during care transitions.
 Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer’s Caregiver Health (REACH II) is a multicomponent, evidence-based
ADRD caregiver support program that has been adapted and implemented in the Veterans Health
Administration as REACH VA. When delivered in the community, REACH II and REACH VA were associated
with improvements in caregiver depression, caregiver social support, and caregiver self-care and a decrease in
caregiver burden and problem behaviors in the care recipient. Evidence-based interventions, like REACH II,
are challenging to scale and spread due to the need for one-on-one interactions between caregivers and
dementia care specialists for skills training. GamePlan4Care (GP4C) is a novel, web-based training platform
designed to fully replicate the core components of REACH II in an acceptable and scalable online platform
informed by user-centered testing. With adaptation to the hospital setting to include care transitions training,
GP4C has great potential to transform the support of ADRD caregivers during care transitions.
 This proposal will combine evidence-informed care transitions training with an existing dementia caregiver
support intervention to create a new and unique intervention: Hospital GP4C. Using a Planned Adaptation
Approach, we will build on the existing GP4C platform to incorporate the robust evidence supporting tailored
care transitions training and support. The aims are to: 1) adapt GP4C for hospital care (Hospital GP4C), 2)
evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the Hospital GP4C intervention, and 3) to evaluate caregiver-
reported outcomes and retention rates in a pilot randomized study of Hospital GP4C compared to health
education. In Aim 1, semi-structured interviews with caregivers and staff will be used to inform the planned
adaptation of GP4C for hospital care. Human-centered design will be used to develop care transitions specific
content to supplement existing GP4C content. In Aim 2, quantitative and qualitative data will be collected to
assess the feasibility and acceptability of Hospital GP4C. In Aim 3, a single site pilot randomized study of
Hospital GP4C compared to a health education control will be conducted. Caregivers will be recruited in the
hospital. The results of this award will inform a VA Merit Award for a multisite randomized controlled trial of
Hospital GP4C."
10909237,"Drug development for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been challenging and expensive.
Drug failures are very likely due, in large part, to the differential responses of patients to
different treatments. Some subsets of patients have treatment moderators and respond
differently. Identifying such responsive subsets has been challenging due to limited sample size
in one clinical trial or may be beyond the scope of the ad-hoc analyses in individual clinical
trials, considering the complexity of AD. Another important subset of patients are rapid
progressors, who have faster rates of cognitive decline in a defined period and may respond
differently to treatments than other AD patients. Predicting the rapid progressors and their
differential responses is very challenging. Machine learning prediction has been no better than
random guesses due to volatility of cognitive scores and insufficiency of comprehensive and
fine-grained longitudinal clinical data. Pooling patient-level data from multiple clinical trials data
may address the above challenges by increasing sample size and obtaining a better
coverage/representation of the patient population. However, many clinical trials data are stored
in distributed data access servers, and data use agreements often prohibit exporting the patient-
level data out of the local servers. We aim to address the challenges via advanced informatics
tools using AI/ML models. We will develop privacy-preserving federated models to harmonize
local counterfactual effect estimation models into a global model without exchanging patient-
level data. Aim 1 focuses on developing a federated subgrouping model based on differential
responses. Aim 2 focuses on developing a federated counterfactual regression model using
deep learning to predict rapid progressors and their differential responses. Aim 3 focuses on
verifying and refining the subgroups prediction using real-world observation in nation-wide
consortium data. If successful, this project will contribute to identifying patient subgroups that
respond differently, which will result in smaller, less expensive, and more targeted AD clinical
trials that expose fewer patients to experimental medications to which they are unlikely to
respond."
10883727,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), proteins that do not assume a preferred folded conformation in
solution, make up around one-third of the entire human proteome, and their misfolding is a causative agent of
several serious diseases. Although an array of biophysical tools has been applied to the structural analysis of
IDPs, there is still a significant gap between the need to accurately measure IDP structures and the available
tools. Current tools provide either not enough information content to gain significant insight on the many IDP
structures present in the overall ensemble or can only provide an ensemble average due to interconversion of
conformations over the time frame of the experiment. Therefore, the goal of this application is to apply native ion
mobility/mass spectrometry (IM/MS) tools developed in the Webb laboratory for analyzing well-folded proteins
in combination with molecular dynamics to characterize the structural ensembles of IDPs and intrinsically
disordered regions (IDRs) with conformational and proteoform specificity and to determine the effect on those
structural ensembles of post-translational modifications (PTMs).
 The proposed work in this application is expected to answer the following biological questions: 1.) What
are the IDP conformations in the overall ensemble? Crosslinked and labeled IDPs/IDRs will be identified
under native-like conditions to determine structural ensembles as a function of solution conformation (by IM and
MS). Crosslinking/labeling identifications will be used to determine structural ensembles of IDPs/IDRs with
molecular dynamics. 2.) How do post translational modifications and ligand binding affect IDP structure?
These methods will be used to measure how PTMs and small molecule binding affects conformational
ensembles of IDPs, linking structural changes to their functions and to aggregation. 3.) Which conformational
states and proteoforms of histones bind epigenetic partners? Histone tails are IDRs decorated with many
combinations of PTMs that regulate access to DNA. We will use our tools on individual histones, on the intact
nucleosome, and on nucleosomes upon binding modifier and reader proteins to measure changes in structural
ensembles.
 This research represents a substantive departure from the status quo by using a combined solution
(crosslinking and labeling) and gas-phase MS structural toolkit to provide structural details of IDPs/IDRs
measured independently by proteoform and conformation. The research is significant because it is expected to
bridge the gap between the tools available for the conformational study of IDPs and the fundamental and
biomedical need to characterize their structures. Ultimately, IDP conformational characterization is likely to lead
to a much broader understanding of cellular biology and the importance of IDPs/IDRs as interaction hubs and
regulators and a better understanding of their roles in disease and treatment."
10884434,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Speech is central to human life. Yet how the human brain converts patterns of acoustic speech energy into
meaning remains unclear. This is particularly true for natural, continuous speech, which requires us to efficiently
parse and process speech at multiple timescales in the context of our ongoing conversation and situational
knowledge. Much progress has been made on this problem in recent years by the realization that the dynamics
of cortical activity track those of natural speech. This has led to the development of new methods to study the
neurophysiology of speech processing in more naturalistic paradigms. However, the field still lacks consensus
regarding the precise physiological mechanisms and neurostructural origins of this tracking. In particular, two
contrasting theories have been advanced that attempt to explain the genesis of this phenomenon. The first
proposes that the quasi-rhythmic nature of continuous speech “entrains” intrinsic, endogenous oscillations in the
brain as a way to parse that continuous speech into smaller units for further (linguistic) processing. Meanwhile,
the second proposes that the cortical tracking of speech reflects the summation of a series of transient evoked
responses from hierarchically organized neural networks that are tuned to the different acoustic and linguistic
features of speech. The contrast between these two ideas is reflected in the emergence of two almost completely
non-overlapping literatures in the field of speech electrophysiology. This is highly problematic as the design and
interpretation of most studies on this important topic are now filtered through either one or the other of these
theoretical lenses. Without a clear understanding of the true mechanisms involved, our collective work on this
topic thus runs the risk of being distorted through misconception. This project aims to address this urgent need
by critically examining these two frameworks side by side. We aim to do so by collecting scalp EEG from human
adults as they listen to natural and manipulated speech. These manipulations will involve varying speech across
several dimensions that should maximize the differences in the predictions made by each theory. We specifically
aim to test the hypothesis that both evoked responses and entrained oscillations contribute to the cortical tracking
of speech, with their relative contributions varying as a function of the statistics of the speech and attention. We
will test this hypothesis by analyzing the EEG data with reference to computational models of both evoked and
oscillatory activity. Furthermore, we will use the same analytical framework to model signals from different
regions of the speech/language processing hierarchy acquired using intracranial recordings in neurosurgical
patients. This will allow us to test the deeper hypothesis that evoked and oscillatory mechanisms operate
differently in different cortical areas. We will also leverage these intracranial findings to develop a fuller
understanding of our scalp EEG signals with a view to strengthening the applicability of our work to future
cognitive and clinical research."

The Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Cancer Center proposes to renew its T32 Training Program in
Cancer Biology and Therapeutics, supporting mentorship of physician scientists (MDs and MD/PhDs) for
careers in cancer research. With a 25-year history, the program enrols trainees who have completed clinical
fellowships in any cancer-related discipline, and supports their training in laboratory-based or clinical cancer
research. The program is poised at the intersection of basic, translational and clinical cancer research, and aims
to prepare the next generation of physician scientists for academic careers in oncology, tuned to the latest
advances in basic cancer research and the rapid evolution of novel cancer therapies. Program Directors (PD)
are Dr. Daniel Haber, an accomplished laboratory-based cancer genetics investigator and Dr. Lecia Sequist, a
leading clinical researcher in thoracic oncology. Together, they oversee all administrative aspects of the program,
with Dr. Haber overseeing the mentoring of lab-based trainees and Dr. Sequist overseeing the mentoring of
clinical research trainees. An Internal Advisory Committee (IAC) participates in the competitive selection of
trainees and the selection of faculty mentors; an External Advisory Board (EAB) convenes annually to evaluate
the strategic direction of the program. Mentors are drawn from multiple disciplines and departments, primarily
from MGH, but also from neighboring MIT and other Harvard institutions. Laboratory mentors span disciplines,
including molecular cancer biology, cancer immunology, computational biology, and single cell systems biology,
while clinical research mentors have expertise in first-in-human/phase 1 clinical trials, and molecular
pathology/diagnostics. Trainees are selected from highly competitive clinical programs, including the combined
Dana Farber/Mass General Brigham medical oncology fellowship program. The PDs and IAC have a strong
commitment to enhancing diversity among the pool of applicants and the roster of mentors. In addition to
facilitating the selection of an appropriate research mentor, the T32 program provides both mandatory and
optional courses, as well as a broad range of educational experiences. Mandatory didactic courses include
biostatistics/computational biology and the ethical conduct of research. In addition to regular meetings with their
mentors and with the PDs, trainees present their work at an annual retreat, providing for ongoing feedback at
successive stages of their research training. Success is measured by trainees’ academic productivity during and
after their T32 support, as well as by their self-reported learning experience. In summary, through its emphasis
on multi-disciplinary integration of laboratory and clinical investigation, this T32 training grant has a long track
record of success in providing a rigorous and comprehensive scientific foundation to outstanding physician
investigator trainees. Based on its track record, the program respectfully requests an increase from six to eight
training positions (total program), so that it can adequately meet the needs of an exceptional applicant pool, and
provide necessary support for physician scientists training in academic oncology."

Enabling Rational Design of Drug Targeting Protein-Protein Interactions with Physics-based
Computational Modeling.
Current drugs mainly target single proteins; future drugs will modulate the interaction between proteins. Protein-
protein interactions (PPIs) are the building blocks of the complex interaction network that regulates cells' and
viruses' behaviors and life cycles. PPI-targeting drugs' ability to modulate these networks will provide new tools
to fight cancer and genetic diseases, and provide new classes of antibiotics and antivirals. PPI-targeting drugs
will act on the imbalance of cells' PPI network caused by cancer-related genetic mutations and block bacterial
and viral infections by disrupting PPIs essential for the progression of the infection. To rationally design this new
class of drugs, we need to develop computational tools to predict the strength of the interactions between two
proteins, and the effects of mutations and drugs on those interactions. Machine learning and artificial intelligence
techniques are the basis on which many drug design tools are developed. These techniques rely on databases
that can be used to train the models. However, such databases don't exist for PPIs, and might be impossible to
build due to the uniqueness of PPI interfaces. Physics-based methods, like molecular dynamics simulations,
offer a principled way to develop drug-design tools without relying on the existence of databases. Although the
conformational space of biologically relevant systems is typically too vast to be sampled effectively using physics-
based simulation techniques, the Modelling Employing Limited Data (MELD) method can overcome this limitation
by using external information. MELD has been successfully used to fold proteins, predict drug binding affinities,
and predict the structure of protein dimers. In this grant, we propose to leverage the MELD method to create
some of the computational tools that are currently missing to design PPI-targeting drugs. In Aim 1, we propose
to develop a protocol to quantify the effect that mutations have on proteins' ability to interact. In Aim 2, we
propose to develop computational tools to screen drugs based on their effect on PPIs. The benchmark for
developing our tools will be small biological systems that have been previously studied using other physics-
based approaches. The testing bed for our tools will be the calculation of key properties of biologically relevant
size systems that have been studied experimentally, that are available in databases, and that are too big for any
currently available computational tools to tackle. The final test for our tools will be the prediction of key properties
on systems that our experimental collaborators will help us investigate. At the end of this project, we will have
developed and tested the tools to fill the current gap in the rational design of PPI-targeting drugs. In the long
term, these tools will allow us to understand the molecular mechanisms of cancer and genetic diseases, and will
help the rational design of the next generation of drugs to treat cancer and viral and bacterial infections. These
are drugs that will target PPI interactions rather than single proteins. The tools and the knowledge we will acquire
from this grant will be the stepping stone for the future research of our group, which aims to study the molecular
mechanisms of genetic diseases, including cancer, and design antiviral and antibiotic drugs."
10890103,"Malformations of the oral cavity, which include dental anomalies (hypodontia, hyperdontia), cleft lip and or cleft
plate (orofacial cleft, OFC), and salivary gland anomalies (ectopic or aplasia), are among the most common birth
defects in the US. The design of preventative therapies for these disorders will require a precise understanding
of the transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) governing development of the relevant tissues. Studies in
model organisms have been invaluable, for instance revealing that mesenchyme in these structures derives from
neural crest and epithelia in them derives largely from oral ectoderm. However, it is unclear how these TRNs are
deployed over developmental time and within spatial domains of the mouth. Moreover, aspects of these TRNs
are likely to be human specific, for instance those regulating the development of secondary dentition, which does
not occur in rodents. Finally, all of the disorders mentioned above have a genetic basis, in none has all of the
heritable risk been fully explained. Knowledge of the TRNs in human tissue is the surest way to find candidate
genes to harbor such risk. Recent advances in our spatial transcriptomics (sciSpace), and access to donated
human fetal tissue, permit these important questions to be addressed in a precise spatio-temporal manner. Here
we propose, in Aim 1, to conduct sciSpace over the entire human face at four critical developmental timepoints
(7-9, 10-12, 13-15, and 16-18 weeks post conception). We will then focus on the secondary palate and the
genetic underpinnings of OFC. We will use computational algorithms to deduce the membership and regulatory
hierarchy of TRNs regulating differentiation of distinct domains of palate epithelium and palate mesenchyme; top
ranking members of these TRNs are strong candidates to harbor the missing heritability for OFC. In Aim 2, we
will use the results of the first aim to develop protocols for converting induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) into
palate epithelium and mesenchymal cells. We will engineer iPSC with 2 coding and 2 non-coding variants
associated with OFC, differentiate the engineered iPSC into palate cell types, and subject the differentiated cells
to single cell RNA-seq. This will reveal the specific cell types, and the step in their development, that is affected
by the variants, illuminating the pathogenic mechanisms of OFC. These experiments will identify strong
candidates for the missing heritability for orofacial cleft, improve functional tests of DNA variants associated with
it, and provide the datasets to similarly analyze other inherited craniofacial disorders."
10909998,"In sub-Saharan Africa, men who have sex with men (MSM) have 2-4 times higher rates of sexually transmitted
infections (STIs) and HIV than the general male population. In our cohort of 700 MSM in Kisumu, Kenya, the
incidence of urethral and anorectal C. trachomatis (CT) and/or N. gonorrhoeae (NG) was 19.8 per 100 person
years (PY) over one year. These rates are 2-3 times the incidence we measured among heterosexual Kenyan
men. Our studies of MSM in Kisumu and Nairobi have identified specific rectal bacterial community structures
that are associated with inflammatory mucosal immune profiles. Inflammatory rectal microbiome profiles could
increase risk of STI acquisition and interfere with vaccine efficacy by skewing systemic T cell populations
toward an increased memory/decreased naïve lymphocyte ratios, and a higher state of basal immune
activation, as supported by our preliminary investigations. Inflammation could therefore undermine the partial
protective efficacy of STI vaccines ability to prime naïve lymphocytes required for optimal immunity, both by
decreasing the frequency of naïve lymphocytes, and by decreasing the efficiency in which the remaining naïve
T cells are primed. Objective: Over a one-year period, in a sample of 500 MSM in Kisumu (n=250) and Nairobi
(n=250), we will measure the penile and rectal microbiomes, mucosal immune profiles, socio-behavioral and
structural factors, and incidence of urethral and anorectal STIs (CT, NG). In Aim 1, we will characterize the
clinical history of STI infection from time of detection  to time of treatment  to treatment and clearance.
Samples will be collected from all men at baseline, 6- and 12- months to characterize penile and rectal
microbiome composition (via high throughput amplicon sequencing), mucosal immunology (broad measure of
pro-inflammatory, inflammatory, and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and measures of epithelial
barrier integrity), and test for STI by nucleic acid amplification assay. Accounting for loss to follow-up, we
expect 70-90 incident CT and/or NG infections, and for these men, microbiome composition, mucosal
immunology, and bacterial function will be assessed again when they present for antibiotic treatment, and 4
weeks subsequent to treatment. In Aim 2, we will quantify how penile and rectal microbiome composition are
associated with risk of incident urethral and rectal STIs, respectively. As a secondary outcome, we will identify
dominant mucosal immune profiles and examine how they change over time in relation to microbiome
composition. In Aim 3, we will in STI cases identify adaptive immune mechanisms that link rectal microbiome,
host immunity, and symptomatic or asymptomatic STI incident infections. Therapeutic and preventive
implications: The impact of STI treatment on penile and rectal microbiome composition and bacterial function
is unknown and characterizing this aspect of clinical history of infection can identify novel treatment and
prevention pathways. Understanding factors that might undermine protective immunity to STIs could be critical
to informing the design of more effective vaccines that are required to achieve STI control."
10813064,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT: Dr. Ngan F. Huang, PhD is a Research Biomedical Engineer whose
translational research program focuses on cardiovascular diseases and traumatic muscle injury, both of which
are highly relevant in Veteran populations. The overall goal of her research program is to develop novel
therapeutic strategies to improve tissue regeneration and functional restoration to cardiovascular and skeletal
muscle diseases/injuries experienced by Veterans. These therapeutic strategies are aimed to reduce mortality
and improve the quality of life of Veterans. The primary focus area of her laboratory's research program is to
study the role of biochemical and biomechanical cues within the extracellular matrix in modulating cell fate and
tissue function, in order to translate the basic insights into novel therapies that promote cardiovascular and
skeletal muscle regeneration in Veterans. Her active VA BLR&D Merit award focuses on the treatment of
traumatic muscle injury using engineered skeletal muscle that better mimics the physiological organization and
vascularization of native skeletal muscle. In particular, she employs parallel-aligned nanofibrillar collagen
scaffolds to guide the organization and synchronized contractility of newly formed muscle fibers. Additionally,
inter-cellular interactions between skeletal muscle progenitor cells and vascular endothelial cells create a
vascularized muscle tissue that can undergo anastomosis upon transplantation. Her laboratory reports seminal
knowledge in that treatment of pre-endothelialized and parallel-aligned engineered skeletal muscle induces more
de novo muscle regeneration, organized myofiber structure, and perfused vasculature, than in engineered
muscle lacking pre-endothelization or spatial patterning. Proteomic and transcriptomic analysis reveal new
insights into the basic signaling pathways and cytokine profile that mediate this process. In a parallel strategy
to augment muscle regeneration, she also developed off-the-shelf scaffolds with controlled release of muscle
reparative factors that can be transplanted to the site of VML in conjunction with regenerative rehabilitation. With
funding from an active VA RR&D Merit award, she merges rehabilitative exercise with the transplantation of
aligned nanofibrillar scaffolds that release pro-myogenic factors to improve vascularization, neuromuscular
junction formation, and force generation. These research findings impact the treatment of volumetric muscle
loss by synergizing therapeutic cells, instructive biomaterials, and rehabilitation to promote muscle regeneration.
Besides skeletal muscle, another research focus area is the treatment of peripheral arterial disease using
strategies to induce revascularization. In an active NIH R01 grant, she demonstrates that spatially aligned
nanofibrillar collagen scaffolds serve as effective carriers to enhance the pro-survival and pro-angiogenic
function of transplanted therapeutic cells, leading to the restoration of blood perfusion in murine models of
peripheral arterial disease. The insights gained from the pro-survival effects of aligned nanofibrillar collagen
scaffolds have now been patented. In a parallel strategy, she develops protein mimetic hydrogels with tunable
stiffness to improve the survival of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells upon injection
mice animals with peripheral arterial disease. She demonstrates that endothelial survival within the ischemic
limb of mice with peripheral arterial disease is significantly higher when delivered within the protein hydrogel than
in saline. Moreover, the hydrogel promotes induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cell secretion of
angiogenic paracrine factors, which contribute to the formation of more microvasculature. This work is now being
further developed in another active NIH R01 grant to study the role of stress relaxation mechanical properties of
hydrogels in modulating endothelial cell survival and revascularization. In summary, during the past 10 years at
the VA Medical Center, she published 75 peer-reviewed publications and patents. She has a strong commitment
to service to the local and national VA, training of VA mentees, and collaborative research with VA and affiliate
investigators."
10879156,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nanoparticle therapeutics (NTs) that encapsulate drugs in a nanoscale particle has emerged as a primising
therapeutic modality for treating many diseases. NTs encompass a diverse array of nanoparticle types and can
easily incorporate a wide-array of drugs, ranging from small molecules, to macromolecules, to biologics. The
diversity of nanoparticles and encapsulated drugs renders NTs a versatile therapeutic modality that is being
clincally investigated to treat many dieseases in various tissues. Like any other therapetic modality, the
successful application of NTs requires their specific delivery to target sites while avoiding off-target accumulation.
However, owing to their distinct features (e.g. large-size), NTs face unique biological barriers which lead to their
unfavorable pharmacokinetics (PK), biodistribution, and pharmacodynamics (PD) profiles. As such, a pressing
and unaddressed challenge is to better understand the biological barriers for NTs and to develop effective
strategies to guide the precise delivery of NTs to unleash their full therapeutic potential. Toward this end, the
overarching goal of my research program is to identify ideal delivery parameters for NTs and to develop novel
strategeis for precise delivery of NTs. One strategy we are focusing on is to utilize inspirations from the intrinsic
biology, living cells in particular. Indeed, living cells such as circulatory cells can be leveraged as ideal delivery
systems. Circulatory cells can navigate the body, sense pathological signals, and reach diseased tissues via
an active transport mechanism. NTs can be loaded inside or onto the surface of circulatory cells to be
delivered to target sites. My research has made significant strides in this area where we have developed novel
methods to incorporate NTs with diverse living cells and demonstrated that two circulatory cells (erythrocytes
and macrophages) could modulate the PK, biodistribution, and efficacy of NTs. The rapid progression in
advancing cells towards NTs delivery highlights the urgent need for mechanistic studies to i) elucidate how the
interface between living cell carriers and NTs impacts the transport of NTs and migration of carrier cells and ii)
to identify principles for utilizing living cells for precise delivery of NTs. We aim to capitalize our expertise in
nanoparticle design and cell engineering to address this unmet need. Specifically, over the next five years, using
inflammation that occurs in various tissues as a model, we will focus on i) understanding how cell-based carriers
impact the outcomes of NTs delivery, ii) studying how the loading and physicochemical properties of NTs
influence the carrier cells’ migration, and iii) developing multiscale strategies to achieve cell-specific delivery of
NTs. These studies will enable us to establish a set of design rules that govern the delivery efficacy and
interactions of NTs with living cells, which will ultimately improve the capability and broaden the spectrum of NTs
for treating various diseases. Successful realization of our program will not only contribute to understanding the
key features for a NTs to interact with the living cells but also develop a set of principles for rational engineering
living cells to improve the biological outcomes of NTs and other therapeutics."

The American Consortium of Early Liver Transplantation-Prospective Alcohol-associated liver disease Cohort
Evaluation (ACCELERATE-PACE) study is a prospective longitudinal cohort of patients with severe alcohol-
associated liver disease (ALD) evaluated for early liver transplantation (ELT). The cohort leverages the
ACCELERATE consortium with 4-linked R01s and 5 additional recruitment sites in the South/Southeast, Mid-
Atlantic, Midwest, and West, and will refine and identify best practices in the selection and management of
patients with severe ALD considered for ELT across their continuum of care. ALD is now the most common
indication for liver transplantation (LT) in the U.S. Historically, LT centers required at least 6 months of alcohol
abstinence before LT referral and evaluation, though empiric evidence to support minimum sobriety periods was
limited. ELT, defined as LT before 6 months of abstinence, is increasingly performed but with significant practice
variability. There is no consensus on optimal ELT candidate selection, and selection criteria vary widely,
contributing to disparities in access to lifesaving care. ELT is also controversial due to the potential for liver
recompensation with abstinence, which would obviate the need for LT—accurate prediction of recompensation
has the potential to increase organ utility and stewardship. Detailed evaluation of the efficacy of alcohol use
disorder treatments and improved risk scores based on pre-LT psychosocial factors to predict return to alcohol
use are needed to refine selection criteria, optimize post-LT care, and effectively treat AUD. Short- and
intermediate-term survival after ELT is excellent, but the incidence and predictors of post-LT complications are
poorly defined. To fill these key knowledge gaps, we will enroll and prospectively follow 770 ELT
candidates and 270 ELT recipients for 3 years at 9 socio-demographically diverse centers. The proposed
Aims will: (i) inform ELT selection criteria and investigate potential sources of bias in ELT evaluation and
healthcare disparities in ELT access; (ii) develop risk prediction scores for LT-free survival and recompensation;
(iii) identify effective treatments (medical, behavioral) for alcohol use disorder among patients with severe ALD
and post-ELT; (iv) evaluate clinical outcomes among ELT candidates and recipients, including mortality,
transplantation, post-LT complications (e.g. cancer, cardiovascular events, graft rejection/failure), and quality of
life. A comprehensive data repository will include sociodemographic, clinical, geospatial, psychosocial,
behavioral, and patient-reported outcome variables. LT documents, checklists, recordings of selection meetings,
direct observations of LT procedures, and clinician interviews will identify best practices and pitfalls in candidate
selection. A biorepository of blood, urine, explant/donor tissue, pre- and post-LT liver tissue, peripheral blood
mononuclear cells, and cross-sectional radiologic imaging will inform future ancillary studies."
10896329,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (НFpEF) is a syndrome that manifests in approximately 50% of all
heart failure patients. The incidence and prevalence of НFpEF is sharply rising in the last years, however most
patients remain unaddressed. One of the main reasons is the lack of efficacy of drugs, but the other is that
historically HFpEF patients were excluded from many heart failure clinical trials. As a result, current treatment
guidelines exist for other heart failure types, but completely lack for HFpEF.
This proposal will develop a new class of biomaterial-based immunomodulators which work via targeted
modulation of specific immune cells in HFpEF. These cells, namely monocytes and T-lymphocytes, are known
to be responsible for HFpEF pathogenesis and their targeting is hypothesized to delay the onset of HFpEF
and, possibly, alleviate its common consequence - cardiac fibrosis.
We propose to develop such biomaterials and test them in mouse models of HFpEF through consecutive
execution of the following Specific Aims: 1) We will synthesize and test these polymeric materials with the goal
of developing lead formulations that will effectively tune activation of the immune cells in vitro; 2) We will test
lead formulations in in vivo models of immune cell activation and further optimize our lead formulations; 3) We
will thoroughly investigate best-performing materials in clinically-relevant mouse models of HFpEF. In addition,
we will thoroughly investigate safety, including evaluation of systemic immunosuppression of these materials.
Therefore, this proposal is significant, because targeting inflammatory and immune pathways proposed here
could provide a promising approach for developing therapeutic options in HFpEF patients who have not yet
responded adequately to approved and late-stage investigational treatments."

design, data management, and data analysis for the proposed program project to address comorbid HIV and
alcohol use. The DSC consists of a stable group of investigators with extensive experience in research design
and analysis, conducting studies, data management, and methodological development. The investigators in the
DSC will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) to provide support in translational behavioral science study
design, protocol development, data management, statistical analysis, and research dissemination for the three
research projects on management of HIV and alcohol use among Young People Living with HIV (YPLWH); (2)
to integrate disparate data sources and conduct exploratory analyses that address additional comorbidities of
HIV and alcohol in YPLWH, including other substance use, mental health, sexually transmitted infections, and
social determinants of health; and (3) to enhance the research capacity of emerging investigators through
training and mentoring in advanced and innovative research methodologies, data science support for pilot
projects, and assistance in analyzable data preparation and data analysis. The DSC is essential to ensure the
successful accomplishment of the proposed goals in this program project."
10927435,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The translational science spectrum represents each stage of research: pre-clinical, clinical, and implementation
science. Conducting research across the translational spectrum, as proposed in this P01, that meaningfully
addresses alcohol use among young people living with HIV (YPLWH) in Florida, necessitates active
involvement of young people, policy makers and key stakeholders. The Community Engagement Core (CEC)
co-directed by Drs. Nicole Ennis and M. Isabel Fernandez, is tasked with developing and maintaining authentic
partnerships between researchers and YPLWH as well as those with the power and resources to quickly scale-
up scientific discoveries into practice using a community engaged research (CEnR) approach. We have
centralized all of the recruitment, engagement, retention and assessment functions for all of the three studies
into this resources core which is more efficient and cost effective than relegating these functions to the
individual projects as is typically done. From the start, the CEC will engage YPLWH and key stakeholders to
develop: 1) tailored advertisements and insta-stories to post on targeted social media sites and gay dating
apps to promote interest in and recruitment into the three studies: 2) the e-Informed Consents; 3) the SHARE
website; and 4) review of the assessment measures and onboarding procedures. The primary activities of
stakeholder engagement will be: 1) Refine project protocols in conjunction with stakeholders to ensure an
equitable CEnR Context; 2) Manage a web-based portal for bidirectional communication to ensure an equitable
CEnR Process; 3) Evaluate our CEnR Process by assessing stakeholder: a) perceptions of the CEC activities;
b) adoption of new guidelines and polices that result from CEC participation; and c) perceived challenges and
benefits of participation; and 4) Support the recruitment of participants who reflect the characteristics of
YPLWH in Florida. Therefore, the overall goal of the CEC for the SHARE P01 is to serve as a resource for
participant and stakeholder engagement and retention in the research process and to measure the impact of
the CEnR approach across all three projects in this P01. The CEC has two specific aims: Aim 1. Direct and
manage recruitment, engagement, retention and assessment activities associated with implementation of the
three projects proposed in this SHARE P01. Aim 2: Manage and evaluate the dynamic process that supports
sustained engagement and active participation of our stakeholders (i.e., community stakeholder organizations
and Youth Advisory Council) in the research and dissemination efforts of the SHARE P01. The expected
outcome is that ongoing community input and collaborative agenda setting will result in evidence and
interventions tailored to the settings and populations being studied thereby making it more readily accepted by
those communities."

Cells must synthesize nucleic acids to create genetic information that is used for protein synthesis, an essential
process for all life. Nucleic acids are composed of nucleotides containing a nitrogenous base (nucleobase) that
dictates base-pairing in the macromolecule and defines the genetic code. Nucleobases must be either
synthesized or salvaged from the environment for nucleic acid synthesis, and cellular energy demands often
dictate which of these processes is used. Bacterial pathogens must synthesize or salvage nucleic acids for
optimal growth and survival during infection, often through pathways that differ from the host, making nucleobase
metabolism an attractive target for therapeutic approaches. The vertebrate gastrointestinal tract is colonized by
a cooperative group of microorganisms that prevent colonization by invading pathogens by depleting the gut
environment of essential nutrients for colonization. The enteric pathogen Clostridioides difficile infects the host
gastrointestinal tract upon perturbation of the gut microbiota and is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated
infections. Antibiotic perturbation of the gut microbiota alters the nutrient milieu in the gut environment, and C.
difficile must compete with the host and microbiota to obtain critical nutrients to colonize and cause disease.
Amongst the nutrients altered in the gut following antibiotic treatment are nucleobases, and we hypothesize that
C. difficile salvages nucleobases from the antibiotic perturbed gut. Our preliminary data indicate that C. difficile
possesses a unique metabolic pathway to salvage a thio-modified uracil nucleobase, 4-thiouracil (4-TU), that is
present in the vertebrate gastrointestinal tract. C. difficile can metabolize 4-TU as a uracil source for growth
instead of the energetically demanding pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. Recently, an enzyme capable of
metabolizing 4-TU has been described from an Aeromonas species, representing a member of a large family of
enzymes containing a DUF523 domain. However, the mechanism by which C. difficile metabolizes 4-TU has not
been described. We have identified that two paralogous proteins (CD196_RS03875 and CD196_RS15345)
contain a DUF523 domain in C. difficile. Furthermore, our work has uncovered that 4-TU is growth inhibitory to
Escherichia coli, which lacks a DUF523 homolog. We discovered that CD196_RS03875 which we named TudS
(thiouracil desulfurase), is required for 4-TU metabolism and protects C. difficile from 4-TU mediated toxicity.
We hypothesize that 4-TU metabolism enables C. difficile to thrive in the competitive gut environment, and
experiments in this proposal will test this hypothesis. In Specific Aim 1, we will define the molecular mechanism
by which TudS converts 4-TU to uracil in C. difficile and identify other C. difficile gene products important for 4-
TU metabolism through an innovative transposon screen. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the contribution
of 4-TU metabolism to C. difficile pathogenesis using an animal model of infection with mutants defective in 4-
TU metabolism. These studies have the potential to define a pathway for salvage and detoxification of an
understudied, unconventional nucleobase that may contribute to the pathogenesis of an important gut pathogen."
10867453,"Abstract
Pneumonia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, due in large part to the onset of acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), for which there is no greater origin. Imbalances of the biological
processes controlling immunity and tissue integrity increase the likelihood that lung infections progress to
pneumonia, demanding a better understanding of when, where, and how host signals integrate to confer
protection. Here we propose the scavenger receptor lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1
(LOX-1) as a regulatory node for shaping inflammation in the pneumonic lung. While this receptor has well-
established roles in promoting vascular injury in patients with atherosclerosis, its function in the lungs is
unknown. Our preliminary results from both mice and humans indicate substantial accumulation of LOX-1 in
pneumonic lungs. Moreover, our mouse studies reveal that LOX-1 in the airspace compartment, particularly
that originating from hematopoietic cells, dampens immunopathology in the infected lung. This contrasts the
harmful roles of LOX-1 during cardiovascular disease, implicating the alveolar milieu as a unique niche for
LOX-1-dependent tissue fortification. Although LOX-1 has never been investigated in the context of lung
infections, we posit that its expression by alveolar macrophages and neutrophils serves as a countermeasure
to dampen pneumonia-induced inflammation and maintain tissue integrity. Therefore, we will test the central
hypothesis that LOX-1 on airspace myeloid cells bolsters tissue protection in response to lung infection. This
will be addressed by pursuing the following 3 aims: Aim 1) Test the hypothesis hematopoietic cellular subsets
prominently contribute to LOX-1-driven tissue protection in the infected lung; Aim 2) Test the hypothesis that
LOX-1 promotes efferocytosis and repolarization in alveolar macrophages to limit immunopathology during
pneumonia; and Aim 3) Test the hypothesis that LOX-1 guides alveolar neutrophils towards an MDSC-like
state through altered lipid handling and anti-inflammatory feedback, countering infection-induced injury. Our
proposed studies will leverage complementary in vivo and ex vivo approaches in order to reveal basic
biological mechanisms of tissue homeostasis during pneumonia, paving the way for novel clinical interventions
in patients with or at risk for this disease."

The Biospecimen and Reagents Core [BRC] provides high quality annotated specimens and expert pathology
consultation to enhance the P01 projects. The BR&C CWRU and Duke components have long track records of
supporting multi-investigator basic, translational and clinical research relating to multiple aspects of the
Barrett's Esophagus [BE] and BE- neoplasia. The BRC is co-lead by two nationally recognized gastrointestinal
pathologists with expertise in esophageal pathology who have well established track records in tissue-based
translational research. The BRC co-leaders have worked together for many years and have longstanding
collaborations with the P01 teams. The BRC components have differencing and complementary resources.
Both the CWRU and the Duke components have large bioarchives which have been used to support multiple
large scale NIH funded projects for over 20+ years. The BR&C has tissue and blood biospecimens from over
6,200 patients suitable for this P01. The BR&C leverages the Case CCC Shared Resources, the UH Pathology
Translational Research Core and the Duke BioRepository & Precision Pathology Center shared resource to
maximize efficiencies, utilize their expertise and advanced technologies.
For Project 1 the BRC was integral to the discovery of germline abnormalities of VSIG10L as a predisposing
factor in some patients with Familial Barrett's Esophagus. The BRC worked with Prj 1 to define the knock in
and knock out mouse models which form the basis of this project and identified a multilayer epithelium complex
in Prj 1 murine models – recognized as a robust marker of BE changes and linked to BE in humans.
For Project 2 the BRC and collaborators developed the novel approach of using pigs as a model for
esophageal injury – including the study of esophageal submucosal glands [ESMGs] as a potential site of origin
of BE. Inspired by this effort, Prj 2 and the BRC identified and provided sections of ESMGs during screening of
multiple esophagectomies and then worked with Prj 2 to immunoprofile the ESMGs. The molecular
mechanisms identified formed the basis for the project.
For Project 3 the BRC supplied high quality tissue samples and immunohistochemistry expertise in the
investigation of EPHB2 signaling in esophageal carcinogenesis used to define potential pathways of
development of BE – results of which formed the basis for the project.
The BRC, with Core C, will continue to provide support to the P01 investigators and will enhance their projects
by supplying quality controlled esophagus tissues, human and animal pathology expertise and facilitate state of
the art tissue diagnostics including immunohistochemistry, ISH, tissue microdissection, spatial transcriptomics
and single cell sequencing."

10893502,"SUMMARY
Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are highly aggressive and often relapse post standard cytotoxic
chemotherapies. The immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) that target PD-1, PD-L1 or
CTLA-4 represent a major breakthrough in cancer treatment, but 75-90% of TNBC patients failed to respond due
to primary and acquired resistance. The Sacituzumab-SN38 and Pembrolizumab-chemotherapy have been
developed and applied to treat refractory metastatic TNBC, showing the great potential of combined and targeted
therapies, but novel effective treatment strategies for TNBC are urgently needed. We recently detected
transmembrane CD276 (B7-H3) associated with angiogenesis, metastasis and immune tolerance in most TNBC
patients, and developed a humanized anti-CD276 monoclonal antibody (mAb) capable of targeting CD276+
TNBC and upregulating tumoral immunity. Furthermore, we established innovative platforms for concurrent
conjugation of highly cytotoxic emtansine and immunoregulating toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist in one antibody-
drug conjugate (ADC). Our preliminary evaluations showed that the CD276-targeted dual-payload ADC (276-
DualADC) effectively killed multiple TNBC subtypes, significantly enhanced immune functions and overcame
ICB resistance to PD-1 mAb, and reduced tumor burden by 90-100% and metastasis in three animal models.
These results indicate 276-DualADC is a promising therapeutic to treat TNBCs. Our goal is to develop and
examine the effectiveness of combining humanized CD276 mAb-directed Hu276-DualADC, which targeting
delivers a potent chemotherapy and immunotherapy TLR 7/8 agonist, and PD-1-targeting ADC to eliminate
heterogenous and metastatic TNBC cells in vivo. It is hypothesized that this novel combinatory strategy, named
as Hu276/PD-1-DualADC, synergizes multiple chemo- and immuno-mediated anti-cancer mechanisms, i.e.,
direct cancer cell killing, tumoral immunity, tumoral cytokine, and immune checkpoint blockade, to enhance
TNBC treatment efficacy. Three aims were proposed to test the hypothesis. Aim 1 will produce large-scale
Hu276-DualADC carrying mertansine and imidazoquinoline, and characterize its affinity, TNBC-specificity,
biodistribution and toxicity. Optimal treatment strategy will be determined in maximal tolerated dose and
pharmacokinetics studies. Finally, anti-TNBC efficacy will be evaluated in primary xenograft models and distant
metastatic models. Aim 2 will assess the synergistic effects of HuCD276/PD-1-DualADC in three
immunocompetent models. The underlying mechanisms (proliferation, apoptosis, immune cell infiltration and
activation, tumoral cytokine, and ICB restoration) will also be delineated. Aim 3 will fully evaluate the long-term
therapeutic efficacy in metastatic syngeneic TNBC xenograft models post surgical resection and patient-derived
xenograft (PDX) models. Pre-IND toxicology will also be investigated to collect preclinical data for future clinical
trial launching. Successful completion of this project will provide a new strategy to treat aggressive TNBCs."

Despite decades of research, and the ravages of a recent global viral pandemic, cancer will unfortunately
remain the Number One killer of adults under 85. Thus, there is a substantial need for new therapies based on
mechanisms that the non-malignant cellular microenvironment uses to prevent and control cancer. In direct
response to this need, our A1-revised competitive renewal application seeks to continue the highly successful,
multidisciplinary UCLA Tumor Immunology Training Program (UCLA TITP). The TITP, as the sole training
vehicle at UCLA that integrates oncology with immunology, aims to provide comprehensive, interdisciplinary
training to graduate students and post-doctoral fellows at the cancer-immune system interface to foster
immune approaches that prevent and control cancer. An equally important aim is to prepare a well-trained and
highly diverse cohort of experts using augmented professional development activities for productive careers in
a rapidly evolving job market as leaders in academic and commercial tumor immunology. It is an extraordinary
time in oncology as advances in tumor immunology are leading progress against intractable cancers, with cell
engineering, immune checkpoint inhibition, gene editing, computational biology, machine learning/AI, and
multiple interdisciplinary approaches at the cutting-edge. The TITP has superb institutional synergies with the
NCI-designated Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (JCCC), the UCLA Clinical Science Translational
Institute (CTSI), the UCLA Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy (PICI), the Graduate Programs in
Bioscience (GPB), the UCLA-Caltech Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP), and other exceptional
campus research centers. The program Co-Directors and Associate Director have outstanding records of
research productivity and trainee mentoring. TITP recruits trainees from a large, unique and diverse pool with
emphasis placed on research integrity training, mentoring, and outreach to enhance underrepresented scientist
participation. We propose to support eight trainees (four pre- and four post-docs, up to three years, with strong
progress) in a structured program supervised by highly productive faculty. For this period, with an updated
mentor corps, training focuses in three high-priority tracts: Cancer Immunotherapy, Immuno-Oncology, and
Tumor Microenvironment. About 90% of past trainees continue cancer research careers in academia or
industry. TITP leaders, a preeminent refreshed EAB, and four internal Program Advisors perform ongoing
rigorous evaluations with input from trainees/faculty to strengthen the program. A key required element is a
pre- and post-doc curriculum that builds knowledge in basic, translational, and clinical tumor immunology
research. Other strong components include a monthly Research-in-Progress seminar series, annually updated
Individual Development Plans (IDPs), an annual (typically summertime) Program Retreat, and major campus
symposia on cancer and immunology. Altogether, the TITP infrastructure supports an exciting, coherent,
interactive program that uniquely educates graduate and post-doctoral trainees in tumor immunology at UCLA."

This proposal is a renewal application from the Division of Neonatology at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (NCH)
and The Ohio State University (OSU) to participate with the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development (NICHD) under a cooperative agreement (RFA: HD-16-020) in an ongoing
multicenter clinical research program entitled the Neonatal Research Network (NRN). NCH/OSU was selected
in 2011 to become one of 18 academic centers of the NRN. In 2016, NCH/OSU along with an additional affiliated
neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at Riverside Methodist Hospital (RMH) was again selected as one of the 15
centers that currently comprise the NRN. The Division of Neonatology has demonstrated a strong commitment
to the NRN and will continue to support and enhance this network. Pablo Sánchez, MD, Jonathan Slaughter,
MD, MPH, and Kristen Benninger, MD, MSc, are the Principal Investigator (PI), Alternate PI, and Follow-up PI,
respectively. Dr. Sánchez has extensive experience in the performance of multicenter, randomized clinical trials.
By being board certified in both Neonatology and Pediatric Infectious Diseases, he will provide expertise to the
NRN on issues in neonatal infectious diseases and antimicrobial stewardship, vexing problems in the NICU. Dr.
Slaughter has extensive experience in clinical research including clinical trial and advanced observational study
design, while Dr. Benninger studies the long term outcomes of opioid-exposed infants. The Specific Aim of this
proposal is to conduct multicenter clinical trials and observational studies in neonatal medicine in order to reduce
infant morbidity and mortality and promote healthy outcomes. With the strong support of the Pediatric
Department and Hospitals, NCH-OSU-RMH has the necessary academic and innovative clinical and research
infrastructure to ensure continued excellence in the performance of NRN studies. Our Neonatology Division has
a long-standing dedication to improving patient outcomes with a strong focus on health equity. We have
developed innovative signature clinical programs in extreme prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, infant
feeding, neonatal infectious diseases/antimicrobial stewardship, acute kidney injury, neonatal cardiology, and
neonatal neurology that have positively impacted patient outcomes and positioned us as a region-
al/national/international referral and consultation center. In addition, the Obstetric Dept. at OSU is one of 12
centers of the NICHD Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU), and strong collaboration exists between the OSU
MFMU and NCH at all levels of clinical care and research. This ongoing partnership ensures a continued source
of diverse patients for clinical studies. NCH-OSU-RMH has a proven track record within the NRN, as evidenced
by its well organized clinical research program with a substantial percentage of eligible infants consented for
randomized trials and excellence in study conduct and data acquisition. Follow-up of study infants is integrated
within the large Follow-up Program at NCH, and follow-up rates of these infants remain excellent with substantial
departmental and divisional support."
10894859,"Pain associated with primary and metastatic bone tumors is often severe and difficult to manage. Opioids are
first-line treatment for severe cancer pain, but their side effects, including tolerance, addiction and respiratory
depression, limit their use. The search for opioid alternatives with high analgesic efficacy and low adverse
effects has yielded limited success. Long-term goal is to identify novel, effective, and safe alternatives to
opioids for pain treatment. This project is focused on Resolvin D1 (RvD1), an endogenous derivative of -3
polyunsaturated fatty acids, as a possible therapeutic for cancer pain. Using a mouse model of bone cancer
pain. Preliminary data show that systemic administration of RvD1 decreased cancer-evoked hyperalgesia,
attenuated sensitization of nociceptors and nociceptive dorsal horn neurons, and reduced descending
facilitation while increasing descending inhibition of nociceptive transmission from the rostral ventromedial
medulla (RVM). RvD1 did not impair motor function and did not produce place preference, suggesting it is not
addictive. The overall objective in this proposal is to determine peripheral and central underlying mechanisms
of RvD1 exerts analgesia. The central hypothesis is that systemic administration of RvD1 inhibits enzymes
involved in the biosynthesis of pronociceptive prostaglandins (PGs) and the hydrolysis of antinociceptive
endocannabinoids (eCBs) that reduce sensitization of nociceptive neurons and inhibit descending facilitation.
Preliminary data suggest that increased PGs and decreased eCBs in the DRG, spinal cord and RVM
contribute to neuronal sensitization and pain during cancer. Because RvD1 increased eCBs, role of different
types of cannabinoid receptors in RvD1 produced antinociception will be elucidated. The central hypothesis will
be tested in three specific aims. 1) Identify molecular mechanisms of RvD1 antinociception in the peripheral
and central nervous system; 2) Determine functional effects of RvD1 on nociceptive primary afferent and spinal
neurons during cancer-induced bone pain; and 3) Determine functional effects of RvD1 on descending
facilitation and inhibition from the RVM. For the first aim biochemical and molecular approaches will be used to
determine changes in prostaglandin and endocannabinoid signaling during the development of cancer- pain
and the effects of Resolvin D1. The second aim will investigate the effects of Resolvin D1 on sensitization of
nociceptors and dorsal horn neurons using in vivo electrophysiological and in vitro [Ca2+]i-imaging
approaches. The third aim will evaluate the effects of RvD1 on descending facilitation and inhibition by
determining if RvD1 reduces activity of ON cells and increases activity of OFF cells in the RVM and how it
affect nociceptive transmission in spinal dorsal horn neurons. The proposed research is innovative because it
will uncover novel mechanisms by which RvD1 reduces cancer pain. This project is significant because it will
provide a mechanistic-based justification for RvD1 as a safe and effective approach to manage cancer pain."

Cyclic nucleotide-modulated channels play major roles in pacemaking activity in heart and brain as well as in
olfactory and visual signal transduction in the nervous system. Defects in the functioning of these channels lead
to diseases such as epilepsy, cardiac arrhythmia, and color blindness. The overall objective of this grant is to
understand how binding of cyclic nucleotides gates (opens/closes) the channels and how other factors such as
lipids and proline isomerization modulate this gating. We will accomplish this by combining state-of-the-art
techniques: single-particle cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM) with atomic force microscopy force spectroscopy
(AFM-FS), native mass spectrometry (MS), and functional assays like single-channel electrophysiology and
stopped flow fluorescence assays of channels incorporated in liposomes. We will employ SthK, a model
prokaryotic cyclic nucleotide-modulated channel, and also eukaryotic HCN1 and HCN2 for select sub-aims. Our
first aim is to determine the molecular mechanisms for partial agonism and ligand selectivity in SthK. We will
determine the structures of specific voltage-sensor SthK mutants that display increased open probability and
correlate class averages with the single-channel electrophysiology. To determine the molecular mechanism for
ligand selectivity we will use AFM-FS to determine at the single-molecule level the binding kinetics of cAMP and
cGMP to either the SthK cyclic nucleotide binding domain alone or in the context of the full-length channel. This
will yield the energetics of binding of both cyclic nucleotides and will isolate the contribution of the pore to the
binding. This aim will shed light on why cAMP binding does not fully open the SthK channel and why cGMP is
an antagonist, although its binding modality to the binding pocket is similar to that of cAMP. Our second aim is
to understand how lipids modulate channel activity. We will systematically test the effect of lipids on SthK activity
using stopped-flow fluorescence assays and single-channel electrophysiology where channels are in liposomes
of controlled composition. We will determine the lipids tightly bound to the channels (both SthK and HCN1) using
native MS and determine the mechanism of how they increase activity by perturbing the residues that appear to
coordinate these lipid-protein interactions with functional assays. The third aim is to characterize functionally
and structurally the regulation of SthK as well as potentially HCN channels by a newly discovered modality: prolyl
isomerization of a conserved proline in the cyclic nucleotide binding domain, which appears to be responsible
for SthK’s biphasic activation with cAMP. This can be highly impactful, as proline isomerization may turn out to
be yet another means to regulate pacemaking activity in the heart and brain. All aims are geared towards
unravelling the molecular mechanisms of cyclic nucleotide-modulated channels’ synergistic regulation by
ligands, lipids and enzymes, which integrate to yield the channel activation levels required by the physiology of
the cell."

 Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States.
Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy remains a key treatment modality for advanced-stage disease
prolonging overall survival, yet clinical responses vary substantially among patients. The most widely
used chemotherapy regimens for CRC are formulated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as the backbone. The
effects of 5-FU have been extensively studied in vitro and in immunodeficient mice. However, what
underlies 5-FU’s anti-cancer efficacy in vivo in immunocompetent settings remains poorly understood,
the understanding of which will be critical for devising more effective and/or less toxic strategies against
CRC. It is well recognized that cancer-cell-intrinsic sensitivity to 5-FU in vitro can partially explain
responsiveness to 5-FU in vivo, with the underlying model that for intrinsically sensitive cancers, 5-FU
reduces tumor burden primarily through direct cytotoxicity on cancer cells. However, whether this
conventional model is accurate in immunocompetent hosts is not clear. Based on preliminary data, we
propose to test a revised model for how 5-FU is effective in immunocompetent settings: 5-FU-induced
reduction of tumor-burden requires two components, cancer cells’ intrinsic sensitivity to the drug to
prime the response and a distinct requirement for immune modulation to play a major role in reducing
tumor burden. Lacking either component will reduce 5-FU efficacy in vivo. We will test this revised
model through three complementary aims. In the first aim, we will test the dual requirements of cancer-
cell-intrinsic chemosensitivity and immune modulation for effective response to 5-FU in vivo. In the
second aim, we will determine the molecular and cellular basis of the immune modulation that reduces
tumor burden. In the third aim, we will investigate the relationship between the cGAS-STING pathway
and chemotherapy response of human colon tumors. Findings from these studies have the potential
to transform our understanding of how 5-FU works in vivo and build a bridge between 5-FU
effectiveness and anti-tumor immunity. This project also has the potential to unveil new prognostic and
therapeutic strategies for CRC patients. Given that 5-FU is also used in other malignancies (e.g.,
pancreas, gastric, biliary, small intestinal, breast, head and neck), our studies have treatment
implications well beyond CRC."

Significant disparities in maternal and infant mortality and morbidity exist in the U.S, and the MFMU Network
aims to reduce the rates of preterm birth, fetal growth abnormalities, newborn morbidity, and maternal
complications of pregnancy. Novel strategies, including new therapies and technologies, innovative study
designs and interventions, attention to implementation science, inclusion of adequately diverse study
participants into clinical trials, and input from the stakeholders impacted by health disparities are needed to
improve outcomes for pregnant and lactating people. Although California accounts for nearly one eighth of
annual U.S. births, the MFMU Network lacks a West Coast site. The University of California, San Francisco
(UCSF) has a racially and ethnically diverse patient population, including many individuals with differing gender
identities. The inclusion of historically marginalized communities, including segments of the population that are
highly represented in California, will ensure the MFMU Network study results are generalizable, and will
promote health equity for all persons.
 UCSF is a pioneer in innovative research techniques, such as genomics and metagenomics, as well as
clinical research methods, including community partnership and implementation science. In addition, UCSF
has a robust research infrastructure that has supported numerous translational investigations including
epigenetics and infection studies, metagenomic sequencing in pregnant patients with obstetric complications,
studies of environmental contaminants such as wildfire smoke on reproductive outcomes, and placental
biology, including the impact of COVID-19 and COVID vaccines. UCSF has an extensive network of affiliated
practices and referring hospitals that provide care for diverse patient populations with a myriad of pregnancy-
related complications and together with its affiliate, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, performs
nearly 4000 deliveries per year in mostly high-risk patients.
 Therefore, to support the mission of the MFMU Network, we will 1) Enroll a large and uniquely diverse, west
coast participant population; 2) Contribute multidisciplinary expertise of UCSF investigators to high priority
areas of public health that impact pregnant people and/or their infants, such as the COVID pandemic, the
opioid crisis, and the impacts of climate change; and 3) Leverage our affiliation with the MFMU Network to
develop a diverse group of young academic investigators. UCSF will bring a host of novel and innovative
opportunities, including clinical populations and unique technological and research approaches that will
strengthen the work of the MFMU Network."

Endometrial hyperplasia is a precursor to endometrial cancer (EC). Complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH) is the
common type of endometrial hyperplasia that becomes EC in 52% of cases if not treated.
Most women with CAH
can be cured by
hysterectomy,
the surgical removal of the uterus.
However, there is an increasing demand for
fertility-sparing treatments for CAH and EC, especially for reproductive-aged women who wish to maintain
fertility. Twenty to thirty percent of the young women with CAH and EC might be eligible for a fertility sparing
approach. Developing fertility-sparing treatments to cure CAH and EC without sacrificing fertility remains an
essential goal in CAH and EC medicine. Poor understanding of the mechanism of progesterone (P4) resistance
in CAH and EC is a major barrier to developing fertility-sparing treatment. P4 is widely used to treat various
gynecological conditions due to its clear antiproliferative effects on E2-mediated endometrial proliferation.
P4, the gold standard of nonsurgical treatment, is often an effective CAH and EC treatment. However, the
response rates to P4 therapy vary and molecular mechanisms behind de novo or acquired P4 resistance are
poorly understood. To increase success rates of P4 therapy as a fertility-sparing treatment, revealing the
mechanisms underlying P4 resistance in CAH and EC and finding biomarkers for P4 responsiveness in human
CAH and EC are critical. The mitogen-inducible gene 6 (MIG-6) is a key P4 signaling mediator in the human and
mouse uterus. Preliminary results show that P4-responsive (Sprr2fcre/+Mig-6f/f; Mig-6Ep-KO) and P4-resistant
(Pgrcre/+Mig-6f/f; Mig-6KO) mouse models develop CAH via aberrant phosphorylation of AKT and ERK in
endometrial epithelial cells. In P4-responsive mice, P4 controls CAH, restores uterine receptivity, and preserves
fertility. In P4-resistant mice, P4 fails to control CAH, fails to restore uterine receptivity, and fails to preserve
fertility. These data suggest the hypothesis that Mig-6 loss causes P4-resistant CAH by activating AKT signaling
in endometrial epithelial cells and by dysregulating P4 signaling in endometrial stromal and epithelial cells. This
project will investigate the mechanism of P4-resistance by: 1) dissecting the role of MIG-6 in the interaction
between AKT and PGR signaling in endometrial epithelial cells; 2) studying the function of stromal MIG-6 in
response to P4; 3) testing whether combination therapy of P4 + AKT or mTOR inhibition can treat P4-resistant
CAH and restore endometrial function, including fertility; and 4) conducting bioinformatic analysis study that
will identify the transcriptional regulatory function of PGR and find the biomarkers in P4 resistance. This work
will lead to translational outcomes including the development of new therapeutic approaches for fertility-sparing
treatment as well as discovery of new biomarkers, which are important for Precision Medicine in infertility."

Atopic dermatitis (AD) rates have tripled since the 1950s, and are highest in urban and industrialized areas,
likely due to changing environmental and dietary factors. Atopic dermatitis is now the most burdensome skin
disease globally, and disease course and response to new immunomodulatory treatments remain highly
variable. There is a critical need to identify modifiable factors that could improve patient outcomes. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that excess dietary sodium (consumed primarily as salt) is concentrated in the
skin as a physiologic response to poor barrier function and water loss, and that high levels of skin sodium
exacerbate the clinical phenotype of atopic dermatitis. The rationale for this project is that the skin serves as an
osmoregulatory organ, storing large amounts of sodium; and that high sodium concentrations trigger
inflammation, including TH2 pathways specific to atopic dermatitis. Our long-term goals are to understand how
skin sodium influences inflammation and to test whether reducing salt intake or storage improves atopic
dermatitis. The first specific aim will focus on reasons for sodium storage in the skin and will evaluate the
impact of dietary sodium intake and skin barrier function on skin sodium concentration. The second specific
aim will focus on the implications of skin sodium and will examine the extent to which skin sodium is associated
with atopic dermatitis severity and persistence. It will also define functional immune profiles associated with
high skin sodium both in skin and in the blood. To achieve these aims, we will perform a longitudinal cohort
study of 90 men and women age > 50 at enrollment. Enrollment will be stratified by sodium intake and atopic
dermatitis status and severity at baseline. Diet will be evaluated using food frequency questionnaires and urine
biomarkers prior to each study visit, and skin sodium concentration will be measured using a novel, non-
invasive sodium MRI technique. Participants will be followed for two years after enrollment. Our
multidisciplinary team combines expertise in clinical and translational research, nutritional and cardiovascular
epidemiology, immunology, and advanced imaging. This proposal is innovative in its application of cutting-edge
techniques to image sodium in the skin and to define immune cell subsets in the skin and blood. It also tests a
new conceptual model that links developments in the understanding of sodium physiology and immune
stimulation with epidemiologic trends in atopic dermatitis. It is significant because the results will be used to
design a clinical trial that would represent a fundamentally new approach to AD management that addresses
disease triggers rather than focusing only on immunosuppression. Moreover, it will improve our understanding
of sodium physiology in ways that could ultimately impact the management of patients with hypertension and
cardiovascular disease."
10925310,"Project Summary
A person’s genome typically contains millions of variants which represent the differences between this personal
genome and the reference human genome. Interpretation of how these variants cause diseases and
understanding the mechanism(s) of their statistical associations to phenotype are crucial problems in
computational biology and genetics. The problems are not straightforward to address because over 90% of
disease-associated variants are in non-coding regions that have highly specific cellular context regulatory
functions and about which we have limited comprehension. The long-term goal of this project is to explain
mechanistically how non-coding genetic variants affect cellular context-dependent gene regulatory
networks and influence phenotypes. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping and Gene
regulatory networks (GRNs) are two common approaches for interpreting regulatory mechanisms of genetic
variants. eQTL mapping connects variants in non-coding regions to genes by a population-based association
study. GRNs provide information on the cis-regulatory elements that control context-specific expression of target
genes, and information about the transcription factors that act on these elements. GRN-based variant
interpretation is complementary to eQTL mapping and has the potential to overcome the limitations of eQTL
mapping, which are: (1) eQTL mapping is biased for common alleles; (2) eQTL mapping cannot distinguish
variants in strong linkage disequilibrium; and (3) the power to detect trans-eQTL is low. Most previous regulatory
analysis research based on ENCODE data did not include personal genotyping data, and most eQTL mapping
research did not include regulatory information. Joint modelling of eQTLs and GRNs would enable high-accuracy
and mechanistic variant interpretation. However, the required dataset for such analysis - matched gene
expression, epigenome, and genotyping data from the same individuals - are not available for a large human
sample. Available datasets are cross-individual paired genotyping and gene expression data, such as GTEx
data, and cross-cellular-contexts paired gene expression and epigenomics data, such as ENCODE data. These
two types of paired data are also available at the single cell level. To achieve our long-term goal, we will develop
statistical methods to integrate these unmatched datasets (either bulk or single cell) from different sources to (1)
infer high accuracy context-specific GRNs to connect variants, transcription factors, cis-regulatory elements, and
target genes; and (2) detect trans-eQTLs that regulate target genes. These methods can be extended to interpret
disease-associated variants, identify causal variants, and infer personalized drug response to provide guidance
for precision medicine. This project is fundamental for precision medicine, and it will increase our understanding
of how genetic variants contribute to phenotype."
10895373,"Cancer is a widespread group of diseases with deleterious effects on society with regard to human health and
financial burden. Furthermore, the development of chemoresistance to first-line therapies is responsible for the
majority of deaths (over 90%) in tumor patients. Elevated protein synthesis is a critical trait that is associated
with genesis, poor prognosis, and drug resistance in many types of human cancers. Eukaryotic initiation factor
4F (eIF4F), a cap-dependent mRNA translation initiation complex forms a central node for frequently upregulated
oncogenic pathways such as Myc, Ras, and PI3K-AKT-mTOR. An essential requirement for the assembly and
operation of the eIF4F translational machinery is the interaction between subunits eIF4E and eIF4G. Inhibition
of this protein-protein interaction (PPI) has been recently demonstrated as a viable approach to target translation
initiation. However, the published PPI inhibitors suffer from low affinity and solubility issues along with off-target
effects. Thus, our goal is to develop novel drug-like and selective small molecule inhibitors of eIF4E/eIF4G
interaction. Our hypothesis is that the canonical motif-binding site on the surface of eIF4E can be targeted via
mimicry of eIF4G. Our computational approach identified novel scaffolds that could potentially inhibit this
interaction by targeting the hot-spot residues on the surface of eIF4E. These compounds are devoid of PAINS
characteristics and facilitate scanning of 3D space on the eIF4E surface. To test our hypothesis, we will pursue
three specific aims. Aim 1 will focus on the design and synthesis of novel PPI inhibitors with drug-like properties.
These synthesized compounds will be assessed in fluorescence polarization and pull-down assays to determine
the eIF4E/eIF4G interaction inhibition profile in Aim 2. Aim 3 will evaluate the cellular effects by testing the high-
affinity compounds in a dual luciferase assay. This assay enables the determination of inhibition of cap-
dependent versus cap-independent translation. Further, the selected compounds will be tested for their anti-
proliferative effects on human cancer cell lines."
10932142,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Adherens junctions, desmosomes and endothelial junctions are fundamental adhesive junctions crucial to animal
physiology. Mutations and autoimmune diseases targeting them cause severe disorders in humans. Adherens
junctions are found in all solid tissues and link actin cytoskeletons of adjacent cells, while desmosomes form
strong linkages between intermediate filaments to provide resistance to mechanical stress. Endothelial junctions
are distinct, specialized adherens junctions that maintain the integrity of vessels. Members of the cadherin
superfamily of Ca2+-dependent adhesion receptors form the core transmembrane components of each of these
junctions. Remarkably, our preliminary data show that cadherins of desmosomal and endothelial junctions
spontaneously form highly ordered, intricate junctional architectures between reconstituted membranes through
adhesive trans interactions and putative lateral cis interactions between cadherins on the same membrane. We
have previously characterized their adhesive trans interactions in detail, but the mechanisms by which they
assemble ordered extracellular architectures, including the identity of lateral interfaces, remain unknown. Two
projects in this proposal aim to illuminate this potentially critical, but poorly understood level of structural
organization in molecular detail using a cryo-ET approach in reconstituted and native junctions. At the core of
our approach is a method I developed to overcome the difficulties of studying lateral interactions, which tend to
be weak and poorly detectable outside of a membrane environment. Purified ectodomains are used to
reconstitute junctions on liposomes for direct visualization of assemblies using cryo-ET, providing domain-level
resolution of these large structures and identifying specific interfaces for functional validation by mutagenesis.
We will employ this system to determine the assembly and lateral interactions of vertebrate desmosomal and
endothelial junctions, then extend our findings to native cellular junctions using in situ cryo-ET. Two further
projects investigate how cadherin adhesive and lateral interaction properties translate into function at the level
of tissue organization, integrity and cell sorting using the power of model organism genetics. Direct assessment
of the effects of modifying cadherin properties on morphogenesis in whole organisms has been prevented by
functional redundancy and the high cost, difficulty and time of mouse models. These barriers are overcome in
model organisms, Drosophila and C. elegans, which have highly restricted cadherin repertoires and far superior
genetic tractability. We aim to define the molecular interactions of the adherens junction cadherins of these
model organisms by a combined x-ray crystallography, cryo-EM, cryo-ET and biophysical approach to open up
the use of these facile model systems for structure-function studies testing mutations that modify adhesive
binding specificities, affinities and lateral interactions. Overall, our approach will define a new level of junctional
organization across a range of fundamental adhesive structures and provide a substantial step in our ability to
interrogate the functional effects of cadherin molecular properties on tissue morphogenesis and architecture."
10918173,"Project Summary
A lack of visual experience may affect language development in the domains of word learning and vocabulary
development in ways that necessitate specific instructional approaches and interventions for blind children.
Compared to sighted children, blind children may learn more words from speech because they do not casually
perceive writing in their environment and often experience reading delays. They may also learn fewer words
from direct perceptual experience because they cannot acquire the meanings of words by perceiving their ref-
erents visually. Cumulatively, these word learning differences may affect the trajectory of vocabulary develop-
ment in early and middle childhood. An improved understanding of vocabulary development could improve ed-
ucation for this underserved population. Unfortunately, word learning and vocabulary are understudied within
the area of blind children’s language development. This observational analytic study employing a cross-sec-
tional design directly compares self-reported modes (perceptual or linguistic) and channels (spoken or written)
of word learning for individual words in blind and sighted children. It also compares their trajectories of vocabu-
lary development from age 5 to 12. Specific aims are 1) Determine whether vocabulary development in blind
children is delayed relative to sighted children; 2) Examine whether mode and channel of word learning in blind
children differ from those in sighted children; and 3) Present a dataset of age-of-acquisition (AoA), mode-of-
acquisition (MoA), and channel-of-acquisition (CoA) norms for future use in research. The approach is innova-
tive because objective age-of-acquisition norms (obtained from children themselves rather than subjective
adult estimates) are more reliable and valid than subjective norms and are exceptionally rare. The verbal ad-
ministration of tasks that are typically administered visually will make them accessible not only to blind children,
but to any child with a reading or learning disability. Finally, the virtual approach to data collection will allow the
researchers to reach more individuals from a population that is historically difficult to study. The project is an
instrumental part of the PI’s long-term goal of understanding how vocabulary develops without sight and apply-
ing this understanding to improve educational strategies and outcomes in blind children."
10932875,"Project Summary: The structure, dynamics and function of a biomolecule play a key role in determining
disease mechanisms, knowledge of which is essential for early diagnosis, drug development and effective
treatment. Many biological studies focus on structure determination of biomolecules but the study of dynamics
is vital to understand disease mechanisms, including their function and interaction with their environment.
Compared to other biophysical methods, multi-frequency 2D Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy are
powerful methods for studying structural dynamics of proteins at physiological temperatures for a wide range of
time scales (sub-𝑛𝑠 to tens of 𝜇𝑠) and can provide a detailed description of motion that includes both dynamics
as well as local structural ordering. Despite major advances, multi-frequency 2D-ESR lack sufficient sensitivity
and resolution needed to study biological systems at 𝜇𝑠 timescales, because the signals are heavily dominated by
noise with Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) of unity and so are hardly visible. To address this problem, the
proposed research will develop computational methods based on wavelet transforms to remove noise for
accurate signal recovery. The proposed research is aimed at developing multidimensional wavelet denoising for
multi-frequency 2D-ESR signals at SNR ~ 1, extending the 1D wavelet denoising approach. Wavelet transforms
provide a powerful approach to remove noise as they focus on separating noise from the signal, an active subject
in the field of signal processing. The methods will include multi-dimensional representation of signals,
development of new wavelets, enhancement in signal resolution in the wavelet domain, and development of noise
thresholds based on well-defined statistical theorems, all of which will contribute to separate noise from signals.
A new criterion will also be developed and adopted to quantify noise and uncertainty. The new denoising
methods will be applied to reveal conformational dynamics of a well-characterized T4 Lysozyme protein and to
understand lipid-transmembrane interactions ranging from 𝑛𝑠 to tens of 𝜇𝑠 time scales at physiological
temperatures and concentrations for understanding signaling pathways related to diseases. This will lead to a
detailed understanding of protein dynamics at the time scale of exchange between conformational substates and
will create a platform for which motions of biological complexes can be studied, which currently remains elusive
and are of key functional importance. Measurement of exchange rates under physiological conditions is a new
experimental frontier and lifetimes in the range of 𝜇𝑠 are anticipated. It will also lay the foundation for using
data processing methods to remove noise from experimental signals and permit their application during data
acquisition for real-time processing. Data processing methods are inexpensive, easy-to-implement, and easily
scalable to existing instruments."
10931377,"Core C: Pathology SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
The individual research projects comprising this Ovarian Cancer SPORE application require the procurement,
processing, and analysis of histopathological material from patients with ovarian cancer and benign ovarian
diseases. The research projects have needs for frozen and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples of
tumor and normal tissue. The research projects also need patient-derived xenograft models and organoids to
test the effects of novel drugs and define the mechanisms of drug resistance. The proposed Pathology Core
augments the already established MD Anderson Cancer Center Gynecological Tumor Bank and the P30-
sponsored MD Anderson Cancer Center Centralized Tissue Repository with supporting database and intranet
access. The Core provides for tissue acquisition by experienced gynecological pathologists to assure high-
quality tissues for the investigators participating in this SPORE as well as investigators of other SPOREs.
The goal of the Pathology Core is to provide frozen tissue, paraffin-embedded tissue, histopathological
expertise, tissue arrays, patient-derived xenografts, and organoids related to the specific needs of the research
projects comprising this SPORE proposal. To meet this goal, the following Specific Aims are proposed for this
Core. Aim 1 is to maintain a frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue repository of ovarian cancers, normal
ovaries, and benign ovarian processes (such as cysts and endometriosis). Aim 2 is to provide pathological
review for all clinical specimens utilized in the SPORE projects and to provide histopathological and
immunohistochemical technical services as necessary. Aim 3 is to create tissue microarrays, patient-derived
xenografts (PDXs), and organoid models and maintain a relational SPORE Database. This SPORE Database
will provide for a virtual tissue repository that can be shared electronically with all SPORE investigators."

10771306,"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) stimulation parameter selection reflects a balance between efficacy and
cognitive adverse effects. ECT stimulation parameters associated with more antidepressant efficacy (non-focal
electrode placement, longer pulse width) are associated with increased risk of cognitive adverse effects.
Amplitude is currently fixed at 800 or 900 milliamperes (mA) in standard clinical practice with no clinical or
scientific basis. Amplitude determines the intensity of the spatial distribution of the electric field (E-field). With a
fixed extracranial amplitude, the ECT “dose” as represented by the E-field is highly variable due to anatomic
differences in skin, skull, fluid, and brain tissue. This anatomic variability is prominent in older (age 50+)
depressed patients and can compromise both antidepressant efficacy (insufficient stimulation of mood-related
circuitry) and safety (inducing cognitive impairment due to excessive stimulation of cognitive related circuitry).
Amplitude titration, as proposed in this current proposal, can reduce the variability related to fixed amplitude
dosing and optimize clinical and cognitive outcomes. The goal of this project is to change standard ECT
parameter selection from a fixed amplitude to an individualized and empirically determined amplitude. To achieve
this goal, we will focus on the relationship between amplitude titration and treatment-responsive changes in
hippocampal neuroplasticity with RUL fixed amplitude ECT. Fixed amplitude ECT results in variable E-field or
ECT dose. Over the course of an ECT series, the variable ECT dose will result in inconsistent changes in
hippocampal neuroplasticity. In contrast, pre-translational investigations have demonstrated that amplitude
titration results in a consistent E-field or ECT “dose”. Seizure titration amplitudes (based on historic data, 233 to
544 mA) are below the amplitude range of FDA-approved ECT devices (500 to 900 mA) and will require an
adaptor to reduce the output amplitude (Investigational Device Exemption). Amplitude titration will also be below
the hippocampal neuroplasticity threshold and insufficient for antidepressant response. The difference between
RUL amplitude titration and RUL fixed amplitude (800 mA) ECT will determine the degree of target engagement
with the hippocampus. To illustrate, subjects with low amplitude titration of ~250 mA (800/250, high fixed/titration
amplitude ratio) will have significant changes in hippocampal neuroplasticity. Subjects with high amplitude
titration ~500 mA (800/500, low fixed/titration ratio) will have minimal changes in hippocampal neuroplasticity.
The relationship between amplitude titration and fixed amplitude hippocampal neuroplasticity will be used to
develop the amplitude multiplier required for consistent and clinically effective ECT dosing. A randomized
controlled trial will then compare hippocampal neuroplasticity, antidepressant, and cognitive outcomes between
amplitude titration with neuroplasticity multiplier (fixed pulse number) and traditional fixed amplitude ECT
(800 mA, variable pulse number) in older depressed subjects."

Prevention of schizophrenia has primarily focused on adolescents and young adults who are considered to be
at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. These youngsters display subtle clinical symptoms that are similar to
psychosis but not as intense, and therefore considered to still be amenable to early intervention. Initial
prevention efforts used anti-psychotics as the primary preventive agents but these were shown to be largely
ineffective. More recent approaches have focused on the remediation of the cognitive deficits that are readily
apparent and predictive of future illness in CHR adolescents. However, while cognitive remediation has shown
substantial promise for improving cognitive deficits and improving outcomes in patients with schizophrenia, it
has not yet been markedly successful with CHR youth. The proposed study will test an innovative internet-
based remotely-delivered Specific COgnitive REmediation plus Surround (or SCORES) intervention for CHR
adolescents ages 14-20 years old that targets early processing speed deficits as measured at the
neuropsychological level with the processing speed domain from the NIMH-Measurement and Treatment
Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) consensus cognitive battery. The proposed
SCORES treatment package is grounded in a theoretical framework, supported by findings from our group and
others, where processing speed deficits contribute to poor social functioning, which in turn leads to an
increased risk for psychosis. We specifically selected cognitive remediation because it directly targets a core
cognitive mechanism, processing speed, which is a rate limiting factor to higher order behaviors and clinical
outcome in CHR adolescents. To overcome past difficulties in applying a cognitive remediation treatment to
CHR teenagers, we have developed a platform to support our targeted processing speed training, which
involves reducing the heterogeneity of the CHR study population (including a reduced age range, narrowed
clinical criteria, and targeting individuals with pre-existing processing deficits). In addition, we have adding a
novel support surround component which is expected to increase enjoyment and promote retention. In the
single-arm R61 phase, a 2-year proof of concept study, 30 CHR individuals will receive SCORES for 10
weeks(4hrs per wk/40 hrs total) with a midpoint assessment at 20 hours (5 weeks) to demonstrate target
engagement and identify the optimal dose of SCORES needed to engage the target. In the R33 phase, a 3
year pilot study, we will replicate target engagement in a new and larger sample of 54 CHR individuals
randomized to SCORES (optimized dose)or to a Video GameControl condition to firmly establish the centrality
of processing speed. In addition, the R33 phase will determine if changes in target engagement are associated
with improved social functioning and decreasing attenuated positive symptoms."
10920388,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Patients with advanced cancers often develop malignant pleural effusions (MPEs), a collection of fluid that
develops between the surface of the lung and the chest wall that contains malignant tumor cells and benign
inflammatory cells. In many cases, percutaneous or transbronchial tissue biopsies may be pauci-cellular or
difficult to obtain, thus MPEs may be the only specimen available for pathologic evaluation and molecular testing.
Thoracentesis removes this fluid, alleviating symptoms and also providing diagnostic material that can be used
for downstream molecular analysis. In current clinical practice, the thoracentesis fluid is typically centrifuged and
the cell-rich pellet is used to generate a formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) cell pellet that is subsequently
used to make a hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) stained slide for diagnosis along with additional unstained slides for
ancillary studies. Recent studies have highlighted the fact that pleural fluid samples often contain abundant cell-
free DNA (cfDNA) within the supernatant fraction and this may represent an alternative source of DNA for
molecular testing. Similar to cfDNA isolated from plasma, cfDNA isolated from MPEs could in theory circumvent
the problem of intra-tumoral heterogeneity and tissue accessibility while at the same time obviate the time
needed to create a cell block and reduce/eliminate the labor-intensive steps of scraping and extracting DNA from
unstained slides. Despite its promise, there are no established guidelines for the collection, storage, processing,
and molecular testing of cfDNA isolated from MPEs. Our proposal systematically tests several preanalytical
variables as well as directly compares three different cfDNA isolation techniques to identify the best practices for
processing cfDNA from MPEs. We predict that optimization and harmonization of the these preanalytical steps
will lead to reduced false negative results, increased reproducibility, improved efficiency, and reduced turn-
around-time in the testing of MPEs. We will leverage our collective expertise in cytopathology, molecular
pathology, and test validation to develop standard operating procedures that can be easily adapted into existing
clinical workflows. Finally, we will validate these pre-analytical protocols using a CLIA/CAP certified multi-gene
sequencing assay."
10703867,"Midlife obesity is associated with earlier onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and increased AD neuropathology.
Diets high in the saturated fatty acid palmitic acid (PA; C16:0) are a major contributor to obesity. They also
potentiate neuroinflammatory diseases and exposure to dietary saturated fatty acids prime microglia (brain
immune cells) towards an inflammatory phenotype. Because neuroinflammation and microglial activation are
factors implicated in the etiology of AD we hypothesize that proinflammatory priming of brain microglia
exacerbates AD pathology and increases accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques characteristic of AD. If
confirmed, this biological model could elucidate targets for primary and secondary prevention of AD. For the
current study we propose use of a high-saturated fat diet to trigger a proinflammatory state in transgenic mouse
models of AD, and to test whether stimulation of microglial proinflammatory pathways contributes to AD
pathogenesis and progression. Microglia are key mediators of neuroinflammation and directly link diet with brain
health. In the brain the fatty acid binding protein 4-uncoupling protein-2 (FABP4-UCP2) axis mediates
proinflammatory effects of saturated fatty acids. Modification of the FABP4-UCP2 axis is a potential mechanism
by which high fat diet exacerbates neuroinflammation and AD pathology.
We hypothesize that proinflammatory priming by high fat diet in brain microglia exacerbates AD pathology and
increases accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ). The overall objective is to test the pathogenic role of the FABP4-
UCP2 axis in AD in presence and absence of a proinflammatory trigger (high-fat diet). To provide a mechanistic
understanding of how the FABP4-UCP2 axis perturbs microglial metabolic adaptation and exacerbates AD, we
propose the following We propose the following Specific Aims to test our hypothesis: Aim 1) Determine the role
of HFD and FABP4 on AD pathology in mouse models of Alzheimer’s (APPswe/PS1ΔE9 and
APPswe/PS1ΔE9/FABP4flox/Tmem119CreERT2); and Aim 2) Determine biochemical and pharmacological effects
of HFD and FABP4 on neuroinflammation in mouse models of AD. We will evaluate the role of the microglial
FABP4-UCP2 axis in exacerbation of AD pathology. This targeted approach investigating diet-induced cognitive
impairment will identify pathways and clinical targets for treatment of chronic proinflammatory diseases such as
metabolic syndrome that increase the risk of AD.
Significance to Veterans Health Care: Our approach is novel in that it will use a transdisciplinary approach
(nutritional biochemistry neuroscience and pharmacology) to define interactions of diet in aging, metabolic
disease, neuroinflammation, and AD. As underserved populations are at higher risk for developing obesity and
AD, the broader long-term impact of this work is that our experiments will lead to better treatment options for at
risk communities."
10894618,"Abstract
 Cells must maintain a balance between generating, folding, transporting, and degrading proteins in
order to maintain proper protein homeostasis, or proteostasis. A central player in the maintenance of
mammalian proteostasis is p97, a AAA+ ATPase (ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities) that
leverages the power of ATP hydrolysis to pull ubiquitinated substrates from a variety of organelles and unfold
them before proteasomal degradation. Mutations in p97 can lead to diseases associated with dysregulation of
proteostasis; thus, while it is known that p97 is critical to cellular health, much about its mechanism remains
unknown. In general, p97 must bind, translocate, and release the unfolded substrate. Each of these steps is
dependent on p97’s interactions with multiple binding partners, yet how these interactions are coordinated has
not been fully characterized.
 Studies have shown that the p97 binding partner, Otu1, trims ubiquitin moieties from p97 substrates to
allow their efficient unfolding and release. Yet how this deubiquitination occurs remains an open question.
Solving the p97-Otu1 structure will elucidate how polyubiquitinated substrates are deubiquitinated and will
construct a more complete understanding of how p97 processes its substrates.
 Recent work has explored unfolding initiation in the context of the heterodimeric Ufd1/Npl4 (UN) binding
partner. However, it is not known if this initiation mechanism extends to other polyubiquitin substrate recruiting
binding partners or if they utilize a unique mechanism. One of the most important p97 binding partners is p47,
which is involved in Golgi membrane remodeling. Historically, p47 was reported to only interact with specific
non-ubiquitinated or monoubiquitinated proteins; however, recent evidence has also demonstrated that p47
also interacts with polyubiquitinated substrates. Exploring the structural and biochemical basis of this action
would broaden understanding of how p97 complexes unfold polyubiquitinated substrates. To elucidate how
p97 is regulated by binding partners and how those binding partners interact with polyubiquinated substrate, I
will determine high-resolution structures of the p97-Otu1 complex and the p97-p47 complex in complex with
polyubiquitinated substrates via cryo-EM.
 Under the support of this grant, I plan to gain expertise in biochemistry and structural biology, improve
my mentoring skills, refine my science communication, and become a leader with sensitivity for those that also
come from underrepresented backgrounds. Under the mentorship of Dr. Peter Shen, and with the cutting-edge
resources provided by the University of Utah, I am confident that the training plan will maximize my
development towards my future career as an independent scientist."
10845368,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by β-amyloid and tau neuropathology, which are linked to disruptions
in memory performance. Advances in human neuroimaging approaches that quantify pathology in vivo have
revealed a promising target for AD therapeutics known as cognitive reserve, which is the capacity for some
individuals to have better-than-expected cognition given their level of pathology. Our proposed research
examines the role of brain dopamine in maintaining optimal cognitive function and youth-like patterns of brain
activity despite pathology. Successful maintenance of dopamine function in aging may protect against pathology-
related alterations in cognition as dopamine inputs directly into the hippocampus and supports optimal memory
performance. The functional impact of hippocampal AD-related pathology can be assessed in humans using
emerging fMRI analysis methods that measure local functional connectivity (i.e. regional homogeneity). This is
a sensitive predictor of memory performance and pathology burden in rodent models and humans and is gaining
traction as a functional neuroimaging biomarker. Local functional connectivity is also affected by
neuromodulator systems like dopamine, which may support compensatory changes in aging and could have
applications for AD. The extent to which AD-related pathology accumulation in aging interacts with dopamine
neuromodulator functions to affect local functional connectivity and memory is not known. The proposed
research will fill this gap by assessing, within an older adult sample, relationships among memory, positron
emission tomography (PET) measured AD-related pathology (tau) and dopamine synthesis capacity, and local
functional connectivity in AD-vulnerable regions. Connectivity will be measured with resting-state fMRI, and
memory will be measured with standard neuropsychological assessment. The proposed research will examine
interactions between dopamine synthesis capacity and tau pathology to test the hypothesis that elevated
dopamine synthesis capacity counteracts effects of pathology on memory and local functional connectivity, thus
representing a cognitive reserve mechanism. Aim 1 will establish age and tau pathology effects on local functional
connectivity in AD-vulnerable regions. Aim 2 will investigate interactive effects of dopamine synthesis capacity

 Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a cardiac disorder characterized by the prolongation of the latter
portion of the electrocardiogram trace (the QT interval) that increases risk of cardiac arrythmia, cardiac
arrest, and sudden unexpected death. Approximately 1 in 2500 individuals suffer from the congenital
form of LQTS, with 30-50% of cases being caused by mutations in the voltage gated potassium
channel protein KCNQ1 (type 1 LQTS, or LQT1). Over 250 LQT1-associated mutations in KCNQ1 have
been identified, but the impact of these mutations on the channel’s structure and function, and whether
there are common mechanisms through which these mutations lead to KCNQ1 dysfunction in LQT1, is
still unknown. The primary goal of this proposed project is to explore mistrafficking as a potential
mechanism of KCNQ1 loss of function in long QT syndrome.
 Previous studies of LQT1-associated mutations in the KCNQ1 voltage sensing domain (VSD)
found that the majority decreased KCNQ1 trafficking to the plasma membrane and destabilized the
VSD. Additional studies have shown that mutations in KCNQ1 can lead to retention in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) and increased proteasomal degradation. This has led to the hypothesis that
mistrafficking is a common mechanism of protein dysfunction in LQT1. Mistrafficking has been
identified as a disease mechanism in several other membrane-protein associated diseases, such as
cystic fibrosis and retinitis pigmentosa, and in the case of cystic fibrosis, drugs have been developed to
rescue mistrafficking and alleviate disease symptoms. This leads to the additional hypothesis that drugs
that bind nascent KCNQ1 channels and increase their stability can increase the trafficking of KCNQ1.
 In line with these hypotheses, I propose two aims: 1) to classify mutations across KCNQ1 based
on their impact on KCNQ1 trafficking, and 2) to develop a high throughput screening method to identify
small molecules that increase cell surface trafficking. In Aim 1, I will classify the trafficking of all
possible KCNQ1 variants with a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based deep mutational
scanning method. This will allow me to determine whether the majority of LQT1-associated mutations
cause mistrafficking and also provide information on variants of unknown significance (VUS) and other
KCNQ1 variants. In Aim 2, I will utilize immunofluorescence and high content imaging to screen for
small molecules that increase WT or mutant KCNQ1 trafficking. This will test the hypothesis that
KCNQ1 mistrafficking is rescuable with small molecules. Together, the results of these aims will provide
further insight into the molecular mechanisms behind KCNQ1 dysfunction in LQT1 and explore a
possible route for developing novel treatments for LQT1."

Underage drinking on college campuses remains a serious public health issue. Research suggests that Parent-
Based Interventions (PBIs) that target parents of incoming students can be powerful adjuncts to existing
student-level alcohol programs. Although Turissi’s Parent Handbook is the only PBI recommended by the
NIAAA to reduce alcohol risk during the transition into college, this “gold standard” PBI has demonstrated
only modest effects on student drinking in trials and has relied on monetary incentives to facilitate parent
engagement, which do not translate to effective real-world implementation. As such, it is imperative to develop
effective PBIs that can be implemented easily and without incentives. One effective motivational PBI
component identified by our lab is personalized normative feedback (PNF) designed to correct parents’
misperceptions about first-year student drinking, other parents’ approval for such drinking, and alcohol
communication. Further, our pilot trial found that coupling Parent Handbook-like psychoeducational content
with such PNF in a social media-inspired app (ParentCandor or PC PNF+) prevented and decreased risky
drinking in students when parents were not incentivized. Qualitative data collected from parents also suggested
several ways to improve parents’ engagement with the PC PNF+ app which are likely to translate into even
stronger effects than observed in the initial trial. Building on this work, Phase 1 of this project seeks to optimize
the PC PNF+ app based on pilot parent feedback. Further, fnformed by their comments about time constraints,
we will also develop a less time-intensive, email-based social norms marketing campaign (SNMC+) PBI that
communicates similar normative information as in the PC PNF+ app with breif Handbook-like tips for
parenting around alcohol. Phase 1 will also include a national norms documentation survey (N=2000) of
parents of incoming college students to identify inclusive and generalizable norms to feature in PNF+ and
SNMC+ interventions. Additionally, parent focus groups and interviews with university stakeholders at two
sites will be conducted to identify how these PBI approaches can be packaged to maximize usefulness from the
perspectives of parents and universities. Then, in Phase 2, a large, multi-site implementation-effectiveness trial
with three cohorts of first-year students (N=2400) will compare the feasibility and effectiveness of PNF+ and
SNMC+ against the “gold standard” Handbook and a no-PBI control. Parents will be invited by their child’s
University to one of the PBIs just as they would be in the real-world. We will objectively examine which PBI is
most engaging to parents, as well as which is most effective at preventing and reducing student drinking and
consequences. In addition, parent engagement, alcohol approval, and communication will be examined as
mediators of PBI effects on student-level outcomes. Finally, the most engaging and effective PBI will be further
discussed with university stakeholders to identify ways to increase the likelihood of real-world adoption."

Substance use disorder is a multidimensional neuropsychiatric disease increasing in prevalence across the
United States despite increased awareness and substantial leaps in treatment approaches. Unfortunately, these
treatments commonly fail due to strongly encoded drug-associations, often resulting in relapse. Drugs of abuse,
such as cocaine, act on the mesolimbic dopamine system to increase dopaminergic transmission in the nucleus
accumbens (NAc), a key brain region important for reward processing. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) within the
NAc are responsive to increases in dopamine transmission. Importantly, MSNs do not generate spontaneous
action potentials so changes in excitability are dependent on dopaminergic input, in addition to input from other
projecting areas. When studying MSNs in relation to substance abuse, there is substantial evidence
demonstrating MSNs increase their excitability following cocaine exposure or dopamine stimulation. However,
very little research has examined why this happens and how voltage-gated ion channels in the NAc are
implicated in cocaine-induced physiological and behavioral plasticity. My preliminary data suggests a role for
KCNQ2/3, m-current, potassium channels in MSN excitability and the rewarding effects of cocaine. Although
pharmacological manipulation of KCNQ2/3 channels decreases drug seeking behaviors and KCNQ2/3 channels
are important for several intrinsic properties, the role of KCNQ2/3 channels in MSN excitability and cocaine-
related molecular and behavioral adaptations has never been studied. In this Proposal, I will test the overarching
hypothesis that KCNQ2/3 channels in the NAc are involved in functional and behavioral plasticity associated with
cocaine-seeking behaviors. Specific Aim 1 of this proposal will use multiple approaches to determine how
KCNQ2/3 channels influence baseline MSN excitability and establish gene-to-function relationships between
KCNQ expression and MSN physiology. Specific Aim 2 will will combine CRISPR/dCas9 tools and cocaine self-
administration to target specific KCNQ2/3-mediated aspects of drug related learning and compulsive drug
seeking. Together, these experiments will define how KCNQ2/3 channels regulate MSN physiology, identify the
relationship between KCNQ subunits and MSN excitability, and determine if KCNQ2/3 channels in the NAc
modulates cocaine-related behavioral plasticity. These studies with reveal previously unknown mechanisms by
which KCNQ2/3 channels contribute to psychostimulant response, and will provide a foundation for future
experiments to explore how KCNQ2/3 channels contribute to motivated behavior."

Legionella pneumophila (Lp) is the agent of Legionnaires' disease, an oft-fatal pneumonia that is increasing in
incidence. Lp is ubiquitous in water systems, infecting the lungs after inhalation of contaminated droplets. In
waters, Lp persists as an intracellular parasite of amoebae and constituent of biofilms. In the lungs, it grows in
macrophages, mimicking what it does in amoebae. Learning how Lp survives in water and grows in amoebae
and biofilms is critical to understanding and possibly preventing human disease. In past, the Cianciotto lab
showed that Lp encodes a type II secretion system (T2SS) which mediates secretion of >25 protein substrates.
From mutant analysis, the T2SS was required for infection of at least 4 types of amoebae, macrophages, and
the murine lung. The lab also identified 8 substrates that are required for infection of Acanthamoeba castellanii
and other amoebae. Yet, given the large defect shown by mutants lacking the entire T2SS vs the more modest
defects of mutants lacking individual substrates, I posited there are more important T2SS substrates to be
found. When the lab had used proteomics to define the first 25 substrates, in silico analysis suggested that
there are ~60 more substrates, and recent proteomics on Lp supernatants showed that 47/60 of the predicted
substrates are in fact secreted. Since there had been a positive correlation between a T2SS substrate’s
prevalence across the Legionella genus and the requirement of that substrate for infection of amoebae, I made
mutants lacking each of the 9/47 “new” substrates that occur in > 93% of Legionella species. I then determined
that the new substrate Lpw20501 majorly promotes infection of A. castellanii. After immunoblot confirmation of
the T2SS-dependency of Lpw20501, bioinformatics revealed that the protein represents an uncharacterized
family of polysaccharide deacetylases that is predicted to act on i) N-acetylglucosamine-containing
compounds, which may include chitin, ii) acetyl-containing xylan or cellulose acetate, or iii) other (novel) acetyl-
containing substrates. I further observed that the lpw20501 mutant aggregated more rapidly than WT did,
suggesting that secreted Lpw20501 may uniquely deacetylate the outer surface of Lp and as a result impact
biofilm formation. Thus, I posit that Lpw20501 is a novel secreted protein that enhances the survival of Lp in
multiple intra- and extracellular niches. This proposal will i) purify Lpw20501 and discern its enzyme activity, ii)
further define surface traits tied to Lpw20501, and iii) judge Lpw20501’s impact on Lp growth in various
amoebae, in biofilms, and on acetyl-containing polysaccharides. This work will i) increase our knowledge of a
key pathogen, ii) define a new type of exoenzyme, iii) have implications for other pathogens that use T2SS or
are intracellular parasites, and iv) possibly define a new target for controlling Lp in the built environment."
10811751,"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are increasingly important targets for bioorganic and medicinal chemistry,
given the critical role of myriad protein complexes in vital biological processes including signal transduction, cell
growth and proliferation, etc. Due to enhanced stability and functional diversity, helical peptidomimetics have
emerged as a promising strategy for targeting PPIs, however their application is still limited as they generally do
not mimic α-helices well owing to their difference in the three-dimensional helical structures. For instance,
BCL9/β-catenin and TCF/β-catenin PPIs involved in Wnt signaling pathway play an important role in embryonic
development and tissue homeostasis and are linked to several types of cancers. As such, molecules disrupting
either BCL9/β-catenin or TCF/β-catenin PPIs could become novel anti-cancer agents by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin
signaling. However, the successful design of helical inhibitors based on unnatural scaffold to block the PPIs is
previously unknown.
 We have recently developed a series of unprecedented helical sulfono-γ-AApeptides that can mimic α-helical
domain of proteins. Given by the significance of β−catenin/BCL9 and TCF/β-catenin PPIs, we believe that mod-
ulating these PPIs could serve as an excellent opportunity to formulate the general strategy for targeting any
other PPIs involving α-helices. Compared to the BCL9 and TCF peptides not exhibiting cellular activity, our
preliminary studies indicated that sulfono-γ-AApeptides not only can mimic these helical domains, but also are
highly cell permeable and can selectively inhibit growth of cancer cells with hyperactive Wnt/β−catenin signaling.
To the best of knowledge, our findings represents the first example of helical peptidomimetics based on unnatural
backbone in disrupting these PPIs. As such, our long-term goal is to develop novel helical sulfono-γ-AApeptides
that serve as proteolytically stable and cell-penetrating molecular entities capable of modulating a myriad of
medicinally relevant PPIs. The objective here, is to establish the design strategy of sulfono-γ-AApeptides as
helical domain mimetics to disrupt β−catenin/ BCL9 and TCF/β-catenin PPIs with optimal potency. We will first
identify helical sulfono-γ-AApeptides that potently disrupt β−catenin/BCL9 and TCF/β-catenin PPIs in vitro. Fol-
lowing that, we will confirm molecular mechanism of lead compounds is through modulation of Wnt signaling, by
using confocal spectroscopy, TOPFlash and FOPFlash assay, cellular engagement assay, and related signaling
assays to assess the selectivity, specificity and potency of these sequences on the cellular level. Finally, we will
use a mouse tumor model to validate the ability of the inhibitors to inhibit Wnt signaling and tumor growth in vivo.
 The proposed work is significant, as these studies are highly likely to lead to a new generation of therapeutic
agents targeting both β−catenin/BCL9 PPI and β-catenin/TCF PPIs, which will secure the goal of inhibiting Wnt
signaling. The proposed work is innovative, because our strategy of protein-domain-mimicking using helical
sulfono-γ-AApeptides is completely new and can be adopted to target myriad disease-related PPIs in the future."
10828737,"Project Summary
 Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease in which exocrine tissue is damaged, resulting in
loss of tears and saliva. Primary SS (pSS) affects salivary and lacrimal tissue and results in many serious
systemic disease manifestations. Once diagnosis is achieved, no SS-specific curative treatment options are
available; rather treatments for SS are palliative. Thus, there is a critical need to identify etiologic events that will
facilitate earlier diagnosis of SS and development of therapeutics that mitigate the progression of this debilitating
disease. Studies in our laboratory revealed that Myeloid Differentiation Factor Primary Response Protein 88
(MyD88) is essential for pSS development. MyD88 is an adaptor molecule that is expressed ubiquitously and is
required for most Toll-like receptor (TLR) and IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) family member signaling. Notably, TLRs and
IL-1R family members are elevated locally (in salivary tissue) and in peripheral blood cells of SS patients,
suggesting these receptors contribute to SS. The specific ligands and receptors that mediate activation of
Myd88-dependent pathways in pSS have not, as yet, been evaluated in depth. TLR7 is a MyD88-dependent
endosomal TLR that is implicated in many autoimmune diseases, although its role in pSS remains largely
unknown. Our central hypothesis is that B cell-intrinsic TLR7-dependent signaling networks drive pSS
pathogenesis. Our objective is to identify how TLR7 activation of B cells governs pSS disease pathogenesis. We
will employ a pSS mouse model (NOD.B10) and a knockout strain of NOD.B10 mice developed in our laboratory
that lacks expression of TLR7. These mice provide a unique model system to examine the role of TLR7 in pSS
directly. The rationale for this proposal rests on the fact that in lupus, a related autoimmune disease, TLR7
activation of B cells is critical for disease development. Our preliminary data reveal that TLR7 agonism
accelerates pSS development and promotes expansion of age-associated B cells (ABCs), a B cell subset
implicated in autoimmunity in mice and humans, but one that remains poorly understood in pSS. We will test our
hypothesis by completion of two specific aims: (1) Assess TLR7-dependent B cell activation in pSS mice in vitro
and (2) Identify specific B cell subsets that mediate pathology in pSS in a TLR7-dependent manner in vivo. This
study is innovative because it will uncover new mechanisms related to the role of MyD88-dependent signaling
networks in pSS and will identify how TLR7 activation in B cells governs specific disease manifestations. This
proposal is significant because it will reveal new mechanisms that govern chronic inflammation in pSS. Insights
obtained from the proposed studies will reveal novel pathways and specific cell types that can be targeted to
treat pSS and other autoimmune diseases. The fellowship training plan details a comprehensive educational
training experience for the PI, including research experience, development of scientific writing and presentation
skills, and participation in national meetings. The environment at the University of Buffalo is outstanding, as the
Department of Oral Biology has a long history of preparing mentees for successful careers in the oral sciences."
10833694,"Project Summary/Abstract
Malaria and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) remain significant causes of morbidity and mortality throughout
Guinea and Mali, despite substantial progress achieved through implementation at large scale of prevention and
control interventions. The World Health Organization (WHO) set a goal to defeat both malaria and NTDs by 2030.
To achieve this goal, disease control programs face several challenges, including the continuous need to adjust
responses in line with outbreaks and resurgences, changing epidemiological patterns, and development of drug
and insecticide resistance. Operational (OR) and operational and implementation research (OIR) can serve to
evaluate current programs and intervention strategies and adapt evidence-based interventions to meet the evolving
needs of these disease control programs. This research training grant will build upon current training programs to
train the next generation of leadership in OIR to ensure sustained, high performance of the local health systems,
surveillance, monitoring and evaluation and timely scale up efforts of malaria and NTD control interventions.
This renewal application leverages a highly productive public health research training program built over the past
10 years at USTTB, that has enhanced local faculty development, including eight trainees from the initial
cohorts of the program, strengthened the health system with alumni playing leadership roles in the health
system, and continues to train 25 MPH students each year. The training program recently extended to Guinea
and has strengthened south-south collaborations with the development of a similar training program at UGANC
with participation of USTTB Faculty.
The renewal application for a Mali-Guinea Leadership Training Program will provide support for 6 PhD and 8 MPH
students. The program will build a new public health concentration in Implementation Research through
Faculty enrichment and curriculum development, with support from JHU. The program will facilitate a
harmonized training curricula and strengthen mentorship capacity and mutualization at USTTB and UGANC in
order to ensure the sustainability of health services research needs to support malaria and NTD elimination efforts.
A component of this training proposal is collaboration between USTTB, UGANC and JHU faculty and graduate
students; Malian and Guinean faculty and PhD students will travel to JHU, where they will pursue additional training,
and benefit from exchanges with JHU doctoral students and faculty. The program will also support short courses,
workshops, and new diploma courses focused on hands-on OIR, contributing to the efforts of producing a
critical mass of trained public health professional, managers and researchers capable of working closely together
to undertake OIR on malaria and NTDs to refine existing control interventions most efficiently in local contexts."

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a prevalent, lifelong condition that manifests early in life and is associated
with significant social communication challenges1–3 and economic needs1 for children with ASD and their
families. Access to early, ASD-specific services can profoundly improve long-term outcomes for children with
ASD4–9 and depends on timely detection of the condition. However, the predictive accuracy of ASD screening
is well below recommended standards for screening tools10,15,21 and is even lower for racial and ethnic minority
children10,31–38 when compared to White children. Screening tools, which typically rely on parental report, may
lack predictive accuracy because they do not sufficiently account for heterogeneity between and within
cultural groups. Variation in culture-based parental perception of early ASD expressions has been noted
between groups29,46–51, and some social communication behaviors used in ASD screening perform significantly
differently between racial and ethnic groups31,32,36–38. Additionally, existing phenomenological heterogeneity has
been observed via clinicians in the development of social communication emergence across prodromal
individuals44, 53–58 within cultural groups. However, current screeners employ methods that do not sufficiently
capture this existing heterogeneity, and this heterogeneity has not been precisely characterized as
prospectively observed and reported by caregivers. Therefore, it remains difficult to develop new parent-report
screeners designed to account for heterogeneity in developmental trajectories in an informed way.
The primary objective of this proposal is to develop and assess a framework for developing culturally-sensitive
and highly predictive parental-report screening measures to improve the equity and accuracy of future ASD
screeners for use with diverse families. This will be achieved by i) developing culturally-sensitive ASD
screening items; ii) using these items in data collection via ecological momentary assessment (EMA); and iii)
employing Machine Learning (ML) to develop prototype algorithms that maximize ASD prediction between and
within different cultural groups. EMA provides real-time in-context monitoring at time-periods proximal to target
dynamics60–62. EMA is therefore an ideal choice to capture the heterogeneity in developmental trajectories of
social-communication behaviors over time as observed and reported by caregivers. ML develops prediction
algorithms that can differentially weigh and combine ASD indicators based on group affiliation, individual
differences, and temporal specificity and is an optimal approach for algorithm development in the presence of
developmental heterogeneity76 but is underutilized in ASD screening efforts77. Through the proposed research
and training plan, the applicant will develop the skills and expertise needed to make a substantive contribution
to ASD research as an independent clinical scientist."

Despite decades of research on behavioral interventions to improve management of HIV and alcohol and on
the high rates of risk behaviors in emerging adults (ages 18-29), there is only one intervention that has been
shown to improve viral burden and alcohol use in young people living with HIV (YPLWH) in full-scale trials with
sufficient rigor to be published in JAMA journals. Healthy Choices, was adapted and developmentally tailored
for emerging adults to address self-management of risk behaviors and HIV from Motivational Enhancement
Therapy, a brief alcohol intervention in SAMHSA’s registry of evidenced-based programs. We will now conduct
a hybrid Type 1 comparative effectiveness-implementation trial to develop an adaptive intervention (one where
dose and delivery format can be tailored). The first randomization compares an existing brief mHealth MI-
based self-management intervention (THRIVE) versus brief mHealth plus a single telehealth session of Health
Choices. We move beyond a traditional clinical trial by utilizing a SMART design (Sequential Multiple
Assignment Randomized Trial) as an efficient and rigorous way to explore additional questions to optimize
interventions and maximize real-world implementation such as: 1) is there a need for an additional THRIVE
check-up among YPLWH who report >80% adherence AND no NIAA-defined hazardous drinking after one
month (responders); and 2) for YPLWH who report <=80% adherence AND hazardous drinking at 1-month
follow-up (non-responders) which is more effective and economical, the remaining three sessions of Healthy
Choices are delivered via telehealth versus mHealth. As another innovation, we include behavioral, biomarker
and pragmatic outcomes. We plan to recruit a diverse sample of 300 YPLWH across Florida who report any
alcohol use and ≤80 percent adherence to antiretroviral treatment (from clinics, community organizations, and
social media) and collect data at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. The goal of PROJECT SUSTAIN is to optimize
Healthy Choices to advance an adaptive and sustainable intervention designed to improve self-management of
alcohol and HIV in YPLWH while understanding the context for state-wide implementation and sustainment in
an effectiveness-implementation Type 1 Hybrid SMART. The primary aim is to compare THRIVE, an mHealth
intervention adapted to target self-management of alcohol and HIV, with THRIVE plus a single telehealth
session of Healthy Choices. In a single session we can build motivation for alcohol and HIV management but
not address the range of self-management skills. Thus, we also aim to understand the benefit of the remaining
three Healthy Choices sessions for non-responders, to compare the effectiveness of delivery of these sessions
by telehealth or mHealth, and to determine the benefit of mHealth boosters for responders. Finally, we prepare
for state-wide implementation by studying barriers and facilitators from multiple stakeholders using an
established implementation model (EPIS) that we adapted for the youth prevention and treatment cascades
and to include health economic factors."
10927438,"ABSTRACT
 1 Despite the overall decline in new HIV infections in U.S., adolescents and emerging adults aged 13 to 29
 2 remain disproportionately affected by HIV who account for 37% of all new HIV diagnoses. Alcohol use is more
 3 common among young people living with HIV (YPLWH) than other age groups, creating a significant barrier for
 4 mitigating transmission, achieving viral suppression, and reducing comorbidities. Despite the high prevalence
 5 of alcohol use and its detrimental consequences in this population, developmentally-tailored intervention
 6 targeting alcohol use in YPLWH is rare. Self-management emerged as an important strategy in the context of
 7 medical adherence and chronic disease management, with self-monitoring and personalized feedback being
 8 two key elements to improve health outcomes including alcohol use. Recent development of wrist alcohol
 9 sensors provides a promising tool for self-monitoring and feedback based on objective data. However, two
10 critical challenges must be addressed to leverage biosensors in alcohol intervention for YPLWH. First, without
11 existing analysis software, accurate detection of alcohol use (e.g., start time, consumption level) based wrist
12 sensor data remains a significant barrier. Some literature also suggests that HIV may impact blood alcohol
13 concentration, so a detection algorithm specific to this population is needed. Second, engagement in mobile
14 health (mHealth), including wearables in youth, is suboptimal. To address these challenges and to achieve the
15 overall P01 goal to improve self-management of alcohol use and HIV care among YPLWH, we propose to
16 develop the first wrist biosensor-based mHealth suite for alcohol use monitoring with tailored detection
17 algorithem and optimized engagement strategies for YPLWH. We will conduct a 30-day micro-randomized trial
18 (MRT)--a clinical trial design for developing and optimizing mHealth interventions, to innovatively and efficiently
19 address the challenges. YPLWH will be asked to wear the Skyn biosensor for 30 days and report alcohol use
20 via smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA). They will also be micro-randomized twice
21 daily to test two empirically-based engagement strategies – reciprocity and personalized feedback. Data from
22 the 30-day MRT will be used to (a) develop and validate machine learning algorithm for alcohol detection
23 based on Skyn data; and (b) test which engagement strategy works better, for whom and under what
24 conditions in facilitating proximal engagement with the sensor. We will also collect alcohol biomarker (i.e.,
25 PEth) at 1-month follow up, which will allow us to (c) explore the potential impact of sensor engagement (and
26 thus self-monitoring) on distal alcohol use. By trial end, we will have the first integrated, optimized, and
27 developmentally appropriate biosensor-based mHealth suite for alcohol self-monitoring that can be used as the
28 foundation for future alcohol interventions in YPLWH. Findings from this project may also inform the
29 development of new translational behavioral research model to guide adolescent and YPLWH research
30 agenda by leveraging powerful sensing technology to improve self-management in an engaging manner."
10927439,"1 Young people living with HIV (YPLWH) are at high risk for poor HIV self-management, with
 2 detectable viral load in 88%, and for hazardous alcohol use which can negatively impact the HIV
 3 treatment and prevention cascade. Interventions to improve self-management of both alcohol
 4 use and HIV care are critical but have had limited success in part due to the failure to account
 5 for developmental and cultural characteristics unique to this population and stress and trauma
 6 conferred by these characteristics. YPLWH are disproportionately racial, ethnic and sexual
 7 minorities who experience higher rates of chronic and complex sources of stress and trauma
 8 throughout their lives. Additionally, there are oppressive sources of stress and trauma related to
 9 their racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender identities and HIV status, such as discrimination,
10 microaggressions, and stigma as a result of systemic structural and societal inequities. Although
11 stress has been linked to alcohol use and disease management, the pathways underlying these
12 links among YPLWH are poorly understood. Evidence suggests several modifiable factors that
13 may play a role in these indirect pathways. Stress has been associated with poor sleep health,
14 which may impact alcohol use and HIV self-management through the effect that poor sleep has
15 on emotion regulation. Behavioral regulation (e.g., decision-making, inhibitory control), is a core
16 component of self-management and may similarly mediate associations between cumulative
17 stress and alcohol use. Consistent with the overall goal of the P01 to improve self-management
18 of alcohol use and HIV care among YPLWH, this project would define developmentally and
19 culturally relevant, modifiable intervention targets in causal pathways between cumulative stress
20 and self-management outcomes among YPLWH, most of whom are subject to intersectional
21 sources of stress and trauma. Using innovative outreach methods, we will enroll 300 diverse
22 YPLWH age 18-29 to complete surveys of cumulative and intercurrent stress and trauma, sleep
23 health (i.e., survey and ecological momentary analysis [EMA] using an electronic sleep diary),
24 emotion and behavioral regulation, and substance use and HIV outcomes at baseline, 9 and 18
25 months. Further, minority YPLWH are less likely to be screened for or have access to available
26 interventions. In the fifth year, we will use a mixed methods approach in collaboration with
27 community members to develop a toolkit of adapted scalable measures for intervention
28 targeting. The resulting knowledge and tools have the potential to improve health outcomes and
29 quality of life for underserved youth who often may not benefit from advances in HIV care
30 through addressing factors uniquely relevant to them."

Translational control is critical for a variety of cellular processes such as homeostasis and differentiation.
Dysregulation of translation has been implicated in many human diseases, including cancer. Stem cells are
characterized by low global protein synthesis rates, despite high levels of ribosome biogenesis, suggesting that
stem cells actively repress translation. Indeed, precise translational control has been shown to be essential for
maintaining pluripotency, as perturbations that increased translation rates induced differentiation in various types
of stem cells. Although there are several examples of how translation is regulated, the molecular mechanisms
that modulate translation, particularly in stem cells, are largely unknown. To achieve a comprehensive
understanding of translational control, I propose to systematically investigate the regulatory pathways that
mediate translation in stem cells and across cell types. I will begin by developing a genome-scale genetic
screening platform that combines CRISPR screening with polysome profiling to identify genetic perturbations
that alter translation. Compared to previous approaches that relied on reporter protein expression, the proposed
screening approach measures presence of ribosomes on mRNA, which more directly and accurately quantifies
translation rates. This screening approach is also more versatile and can be adapted for studying other modes
of translation by exchanging the reporter gene in the vector. I will then apply this screening approach to
systematically discover genes that regulate global translation levels in stem cells and fibroblasts and investigate
associated mechanisms. Finally, I will focus on genes that are selectively translated using ribosome profiling and
characterize the pathways that mediate selective mRNA translation. Together, my proposed work establishes
a framework for systematic exploration of translational control networks and, in concert with its application
in other contexts, will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the processes controlling translation that
are relevant in development and disease."

Heart failure is a leading cause of death worldwide. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is a leading predictor of heart
failure as it contributes to maladaptive remodeling of the heart. Hypertrophy is therefore a good therapeutic
target for preventing the onset of heart failure. Hypertrophy is mediated by complex intracellular signaling,
which limits our ability to effectively model drug activity in cardiomyocytes. Currently there are no therapeutics
that specifically target the intracellular signaling of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Previous work by the
Saucerman lab has utilized computational models of signaling networks to simulate cardiomyocyte behavior in
the context of hypertrophy. These simulations allow us to explore how drugs may inhibit cardiomyocyte
hypertrophy using a systems biology approach. Identifying drugs that target cardiomyocyte hypertrophy would
allow for translational application. The central focus of this grant is to identify drugs that inhibit cardiomyocyte
hypertrophy and the mechanisms by which they act. Aim 1 will use a computational model of cardiomyocyte
hypertrophy signaling to screen FDA approved drugs that inhibit hypertrophy and validate these predictions
experimentally. Aim 2 will use protein interaction data to identify the mechanisms of putative antihypertrophic
drugs from a separate in vitro drug screen. These aims together will result in the selection and testing of drugs
repurposed for the inhibition of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and will lay the platform for designing virtual drug
screens for heart disease."
10894695,"Ingested food affects the composition of intestinal microbes, whereas microbes can affect the development of
autoimmunity, including Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Many experiments conducted in animals and observations
made in humans were suggestive of the importance of diet. Those dietary interventions that changed the
development of T1D attracted our attention because they can be applied to large and diverse groups of people.
We are interested in understanding how strongly dietary interventions depend on the microbiota and how they
influence the immune system and disease development. The results of our preliminary experiments revealed
that Hydrolyzed Casein (HC)-based diet was a microbiota-independent protector, whereas addition of gluten
to HC diet caused a microbiota-dependent loss of protection. We hypothesized that protection works be
relieving beta cells from stress minimizing activation of autoimmunity. Gluten’s mode of action is facilitation of
both adaptive and innate immune mechanisms. To further uncover the mechanisms behind exacerbating
properties of gluten, we will pursue the following aims:
Specific Aim 1. Investigate the immune mechanisms involved in dietary protection from T1D and its
reversal by gluten.
 · Analyze gene and protein marker expression at the single cell level in islets and pancreatic lymph
 nodes (PLN) of mice on different diets using single cell sequencing and multiparameter flowcytometry.
 · Perform functional testing of antigen presentation in animals fed different diets.
 · Perform functional comparisons of effector and regulatory T cell in these animals.
 · Perform analysis of other cell types in the islets and PLN.
Specific Aim 2. Understand the autoimmune consequences of gluten and microbiota interactions.
 · Analyze the role of bacterial proteolysis in generation of the TCR agonists - peptides recognized by
 mouse T cells in the context of H-2g7.
 · To test the hypothesis that bacterial digest of gluten produces cross-reactive agonists that can cross-
 stimulate anti-islet responses.
· Address the role of biologically active proteolytic products of gluten in innate immune system activation
 in vitro and, more importantly, in vivo."
10897152,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The U.S. Deaf community – more than 500,000 individuals with hearing loss who communicate using
American Sign Language (ASL) – experiences nearly triple the rate of lifetime problem drinking compared to
the general population. Yet, there are no evidence-based treatments that have been formally validated to treat
problem drinking or alcohol use disorder (AUD) among Deaf clients.
Available AUD treatments fail to meet Deaf clients’ unique linguistic and cultural needs. Deaf people’s median
English reading level falls at the fourth grade and many exhibit low health literacy. Therefore, written treatment
materials require plain text revisions, direct ASL translations, or ASL narrative storytelling. Equally critical is the
need to incorporate Deaf values and social norms, acknowledge Deaf people’s history of oppression, and
respect Deaf people’s identification as a cultural– not a disability – group. Limited awareness and resources
lead many hearing clinicians to perceive Deaf people as “disabled” or “impaired,” struggle to develop a
collaborative working relationship, and exclude Deaf people from important decisions about their own care.
To address these barriers, the proposed K23 study will leverage community-engaged intervention development
methods to design, pilot, and refine a culturally- and linguistically-accessible adaptation of Motivational
Enhancement Therapy (MET) for Deaf clients with AUD (Deaf-MET). MET is a brief pre-treatment that
combines Motivational Interviewing and the stages of change to increase a client’s motivation for actively
engaging in recovery. There is strong evidence of MET’s efficacy and a wide selection of evidence-based client
tools when used with hearing clients; however, MET fails to meet Deaf people’s linguistic and cultural needs.
Guided by the ENGAGED for CHANGE model, a multistep community-engaged process for developing
interventions to reduce health disparities, the candidate will design, pilot, and refine Deaf-MET by: (1)
assessing Deaf community needs, priorities, and assets via a series of four nationwide focus groups with Deaf
people with lived AUD experience and other key stakeholders; (2) in collaboration with a Deaf-engaged
intervention development team, developing a prototype Deaf-MET therapist manual and Deaf-accessible MET
treatment materials (e.g., visual handouts, ASL translations, ASL narratives, and/or adaptations to the MET
script); and, (3) conducting three pilot testing cycles of Deaf-MET with 24 Deaf adults, analyzing key aspects of
feasibility (e.g., recruitment, retention, satisfaction) and preliminary efficacy.
Results after each pilot testing cycle will be used to refine the Deaf-MET prototype prior to the next cycle.
Overall study findings will inform the design of a full-scale RCT of Deaf-MET and contribute to the development
of the first Deaf-accessible AUD pre-treatment. Additionally, the proposed aims will provide the candidate with
hands-on experience in community-engaged research and intervention development necessary to become an
independent clinical researcher who adapts, develops, and evaluates AUD treatments for Deaf clients."
10811599,"Proposal Summary
Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most common subtype of breast cancer, and accounts for ~10%
of all breast cancers. ILCs, highlighted by lost E-cadherin expression and diffuse, non-cohesive growth, are
highly invasive, traversing the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) in a streaking pattern of single cells. While
ILCs are relatively slow growing, preclusion of early detection, resistance to common chemo- and radiotherapies,
and their highly invasive nature make them exceptionally difficult to eradicate, leading to significant patient
morbidity and mortality. For ILCs to invade and metastasize, they must navigate the type I collagen-rich ECM
surrounding the mammary epithelia, a process recently suggested to require proteolytic degradation, despite
prior notions of proteolytic-independent migration. A specific membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinase capable
of degrading type I collagen, MT1-MMP, has further been demonstrated to play a particularly crucial role in
carcinoma invasion. To this end, MT1-MMP has been shown to be expressed in both ILC cells and surrounding
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Inversely, ILCs display an extensive accumulation of type I collagen
deposition directly surrounding invasive lesions. However, it remains the subject of debate whether this increase
in local ECM density confers pro- or anti-tumorigenic effects on ILCs and whether ECM deposition is primarily
ILC cell- or CAF-derived. Further complicating the effects of ILC cell-ECM interactions in vivo, changes in MT1-
MMP expression and ECM composition, in other systems, have been demonstrated to induce changes in
transcription profiles. Therefore, this proposal aims to individually address each arm of the MT1-MMP/collagen
axis characterizing its effects on ILC growth, invasion, and metastasis in vivo, in a manner specific to ILC cells
and their surrounding CAFs. We hypothesize that both ILC cell- and CAF-derived MT1-MMP activity and ECM
deposition influence ILC progression through physical remodeling of the ECM as well as via tumor-ECM induced
transcriptomic changes. Experiments in Aim 1 will assess the role of ILC cell- and CAF-derived MT1-MMP during
ILC progression using a combination of spontaneous and engrafted ILC models housing an Mt1-mmp floxed
allele in mice and CRISPR-mediated MT1-MMP deletion in human ILC cells. Meanwhile, Aim 2 will separately
assess the effects of altered ECM deposition in a cell-type specific manner, similarly, using spontaneous and
engrafted ILC mouse models where a floxed Col1a1 allele has been inserted to disrupt collagen deposition by
either carcinoma cells or the surrounding stroma. The experiments in Aims 1 & 2 will be further interrogated
using advanced transcriptomic approaches including bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to unbiasedly
investigate effects on both targeted and surrounding cells. Collectively, this proposal aims to characterize the
influences of the MT1-MMP/collagen axis on ILC progression and its associated transcriptional programs. Such
insights will improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying ILC growth, invasion, and metastasis,
while simultaneously identifying potential targets for the tailored treatment of ILC in affected patients."

10913549,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Decades of research has failed to address Indigenous drug and other substance use inequities in the United
States. These persistent challenges call for new systems and methods to turn the tide on Indigenous substance
use prevention, programs, and policies. The Research Core will serve as a central resource for methods support
and analyses for CIRCLE's proposed research and evaluation projects designed to build resources and evidence
for culture as a core source of healing and prevention of substance use morbidity and mortality disparities
resulting from centuries of colonizer-based racial trauma and oppression. The Research Core is led by a team
of Indigenous and allied leadership who will provide operational support in Indigenous research methodologies;
community partnership and culturally responsive engagement; substance use epidemiology; longitudinal,
quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods analyses; multilevel and mixture modeling; implementation science;
and data management, sovereignty, and stewardship in line with CIRCLE's overall aims and objectives. In
addition, the Research Core will advance four methods innovation projects designed to: (1) conceptualize and
operationalize “culture” as a key construct for addressing problematic substance use within and across
Indigenous communities and settings; (2) characterize novel outcomes and measurement approaches for
concepts of pre-addiction and recovery in Indigenous populations; (3) enhance understanding of heterogeneity
in interventions, implementation, and policies to inform precision approaches to substance use research with
Indigenous communities; and (4) operationalize the Indigenist Ecological Systems Model through creation of a
repository of measures and associated resources. The Research Core will also support innovative pilot work by
early-career investigators from diverse disciplines and helps them develop pilot research into robust lines of
extramurally funded research. Finally, the Research Core will support dissemination of the CIRCLE's
methodological advances and research findings in collaboration with the Administrative Core."
10913553,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is an ongoing need to address underrepresentation of American Indian and Alaska Native (Indigenous)
researchers in the public health workforce. The National Institute on Drug Abuse Racial Equity Initiative
recognizes an overall lack of racial/ethnic diversity in drug use research and need for mentoring, funding, training,
and retention of diverse researchers. The Pilot Project Core of the proposed CIRCLE Center (P50) will address
this need with pilot project funding for Indigenous and allied researchers working specifically on topics related to
substance use inequities in partnership with Indigenous communities. The Pilot Project Core leadership team
has demonstrated successful collaboration in the mentorship of new and early-stage Indigenous researchers
and will be supported by the Administrative Core to carry out its objectives and specific aims to: 1) determine
priorities and barriers to launching independent substance use research careers that can be addressed via
CIRCLE Pilot Project funding; 2) create a review process for CIRCLE Pilot Project applications to encourage
innovations, special projects, and new directions to reduce substance use disparities and advance Indigenous
health equity; and 3) promote synergy with the CIRCLE Research Core and Workgroups to support Pilot Project
awardees. Listening sessions will drive development of the pilot project application process. A review team with
representatives from the CIRCLE investigative team, CIRCLE Community Research Councils, and other subject
area experts will evaluate pilot project applications to ensure selection of projects that are poised for success
and aligned with CIRCLE's overall goals and aims. The Pilot Project Core is designed to leverage resources
from the other CIRCLE Cores that will promote optimal mentorship and networking opportunities for funded pilot
researchers. Participation in the CIRCLE annual meeting sponsored by the Administrative Core, training in
research methodologies sponsored by the Research Core, attendance at CIRCLE meetings (e.g., Quarterly
Collaboratives), and participation in didactic meetings and workshops aimed at conducting research to the
highest ethical and administrative standards possible will ensure that the Pilot Project Core is supporting new
and early-stage researchers in substance use science launch successful careers."
10913558,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This study, “Cradling Our Future Long-Term (16-year) Follow-Up,” will determine if a culturally tailored, evidence
based early childhood home visiting intervention, called “Family Spirit®,” reduces long-term substance use,
suicide, and related consequences among Indigenous mothers and their children16 years after they exited
the program (at 3 years postpartum). Substance use and suicide comprise the largest and most devastating
health inequities for American Indians and are the result of generations of racial trauma and oppression. Family
Spirit was designed over an 8-year period specifically for and by American Indian communities through an
intensive community based participatory process to promote behavioral and mental health across two
generations. The original “Cradling Our Future” study (NIDA R01 DA019042-01A1) was a 1:1 randomized
controlled trial that enrolled N = 322 expectant teen mothers by 32 weeks gestation and followed them and their
children to 3 years postpartum. Mothers randomized to the intervention group received culturally tailored home
visiting lessons delivered by local American Indian paraprofessionals focused on positive parenting and content
addressing maternal stress, substance use, and depression. The control condition was transportation to prenatal
and well-child visits and facilitated connections to community resources, which mothers in both the intervention
and control arms received. Trial results demonstrated Family Spirit significantly improved parenting efficacy,
reduced marijuana and illicit drug use and depressive symptoms in mothers, and improved social, emotional,
and behavioral development for children until 3 years postpartum in ways that would predict less substance use
and lower suicide risk and related problems across teen mothers' and youth's developmental life course. Based
on this evidence, home visitors and supervisors have been trained to implement Family Spirit in over 150 tribal
and additional non-tribal communities across the US, but long-term impacts of this and other home visiting
programs on problematic substance use, overdose, and suicide are vastly understudied. The aims of this follow-
up study are to identify long-term impacts of Family Spirit on mothers' (at 30-39 years old) and their children's
(at 18-19 years old) substance use and suicidal thoughts and behaviors, while exploring moderators (i.e.,
discriminatory stress, cultural engagement) and mediators (i.e., continued positive parenting) of effects. We will
also use qualitative narrative inquiry methodology to explore individual and intergenerational drug use pathways
(e.g., first use, misuse, polydrug use, pre-addiction, abstinence, recovery) with a sub-sample of participants. If
favorable long-term impacts are found, findings could leverage federal support for evidence-based home visiting
implementation that is still under-utilized in tribal communities. Tribal populations deserve greater evidence for
effective cultural strengths-based solutions to redress lasting behavioral and mental health effects of colonization
and racism."
10913563,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Problematic substance use (SU) is an ongoing epidemic across American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN)
communities, with AIAN people experiencing the highest rates of SU-related morbidity and mortality of any
racial/ethnic group. However, AIAN young men have been largely neglected by SU prevention science. There is
a lack of prevention strategies supported by science, and specifically designed for AIAN men during the critical
time as they transition from adolescents to adulthood. Moreover, no current prevention programming has been
designed to leverage contextual (e.g., historical trauma and colonization) and cultural strengths to optimize
effectiveness and sustainability. Rich cultural and traditional practices are particularly vital for AI men, yet these
practices and worldviews are largely untapped to date. Our team has spent the past two years adapting and
piloting the Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA), an evidence-based, transdiagnostic intervention
that can be tailored to meet the unique needs of participants. The proposed study builds on this track record of
adapting CETA for Indigenous prevention science, 35+ years of research collaboration between the Johns
Hopkins Center for Indigenous Health (CIH; formerly Center for American Indian Health) and the Navajo Nation,
and CIH's decades of experience disseminating and scaling evidence-based interventions that have now
reached over 150+ AIAN communities. Led by a team of Indigenous researchers and allied co-investigators, and
in collaboration with a Community Research Council, our team will collaborate with two rural Navajo communities
to adapt CETA and test this adapted version, Hastóí Bidziil (Strong Men), in a randomized controlled trial through
the following Aims: Aim 1: Adapt CETA and associated implementation strategies for young AI men, age
18-26 years, resulting in the Hastóí Bidziil (Strong Men) intervention. Hypothesis: Standard delivery of
CETA will require modifications for cultural and gendered specific delivery of CETA for maximum community
impact. Aim 2: Determine the effectiveness of Hastóí Bidziil for reducing SU among N=160 AI men (ages
18-26) using a randomized controlled trial design. Hypothesis: Hastóí Bidziil will reduce SU among young
adult males enrolled in the intervention arm of the randomized controlled trial. Aim 3: Explore mediators and
moderators of Hastóí Bidziil, guided by the Indigenist Ecological Systems Model, to inform a precision
approach to implementation. Hypothesis: Program effectiveness will be driven by several moderating and
mediating factors which will help inform how best to scale, implement, and tailor the program if proven effective.
This project synergizes with CIRCLE's aims of advancing Indigenous and allied leadership, understanding
heterogeneous patterns of SU to further a precision public health approach to SU prevention, and building on
Indigenous sources of strength. Our focus also aligns with recent NIDA funding priorities particularly focused on
reducing drug use inequities."

This renewal application seeks support for our well-established T32 postdoctoral research training program in
basic, translational and clinical investigations of rheumatic and autoimmune diseases and the significant health
disparities associated with these diseases. The Research Training Program in Inflammatory and Fibrosing
Diseases is centered in the Rheumatology Division at the Medical University of South Carolina. The program's
ultimate goal is to improve the healthcare and outcomes for individuals with rheumatic diseases in the
southeastern United States. Our training program emphasizes the interrelationship between inflammation and
fibrosis and how these biologic processes impact end organ function such as renal disease in lupus and lung
disease in scleroderma. The participating faculty members have particular strengths and existing collaborations
in areas of health outcomes and community-based research, epidemiology of rheumatic diseases, health
disparities, gene/environment interactions, innate immunity and adoptive immunotherapy, lupus nephritis,
signaling pathways leading to fibrosis, matrix proteins, scleroderma lung disease, and disease biomarkers.
Trainees matriculate to 1 of 3 research tracks: Bench Research Track for Clinicians, Clinical Investigator Track
including a Master of Science in Clinical Research degree, and Translational Research Track for Non-Clinicians.
The program's structure helps trainees gain critical skills for sustained careers in academic medicine in a flexible
framework that accommodates a diverse range of prior education/experience and multiple modes of investigation
focused on the programmatic theme. Established in 2005, with NIAMS T32 support for 3 cycles (2005-2021),
this program has graduated 21 postdoctoral fellows to date: 19 females, 2 males including 4 underrepresented
minority (URM) fellows; 9 MD, 2 MD/PhD, 10 PhD. Collectively, they published 135 peer-reviewed publications
(89 first authored) based on their research training. Currently, 13 remain in academic research, 3 in clinical
practice, 3 in industry research, and 1 in the nonprofit sector. We propose 16 Primary Mentors and 6 Emerging
Mentors of which 3 are URMs. For the coming year, 3 fellows will be appointed: 1 female PhD and two female
rheumatology fellows (1 Med/Peds fellow). The current application requests continued support for 3 fellowship
positions. Fellows will be on the research training grant for 2 years with an option for a 3rd year if justified based
on productivity and potential. Application numbers for our fellowship program have doubled over the last 5 years
due to increased interest in rheumatology as well as national recognition of our program's excellence. The
Program Steering Committee will review and approve the selection and annual re-appointment based on specific
criteria, evaluation data and slot availability with input from the External Advisory Committee. In this renewal, our
research areas have expanded into other rheumatic diseases and into other fields of research (microbiome,
community interventions, oral health, regenerative medicine and cellular therapies)."
10904854,"Despite evidence that 1 in 5 children are at risk for psychiatric disorders, only 1 in 20 young children receive
mental health care. Thus, a high number of children who would benefit from mental health care remain untreated.
My long-term goal is to improve brain-based targets for early detection and behavioral interventions of childhood
psychiatric disorders. The area of perinatal-developmental neuroscience (PDN) is of high public health
significance as a substantial proportion of pregnant women will experience health, environmental, or
psychological stressors, which have early and long-lasting effects on offspring. Increasing the number of
research programs that can support training in PDN is paramount. The K24 will allow me to: 1) expand my
expertise in advanced analytic methods to support trainee research, and 2) establish an internationally
recognized research and training program focused on fetal-infant brain and behavioral origins of mental health.
My K24 training program, the Columbia Engagement, Stability, and Success in PDN will provide an individualized
approach to research training: assessing the research skills and career goals of mentees early on and developing
personalized training modules; didactics; experiential, hands-on training; and research productivity that follow
their individualized plan. The program also includes a monthly seminar series alternating between science and
career-networking topics. Our prior studies suggest there may be common biological pathways by which early
exposures exert their influence on offspring conferring psychiatric risk – with recent attention to the immune
system and/or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and brain regions involved in behavioral regulation. Using the
expanded analytic skills obtained through this K24, my mentees and I will conduct studies to examine whether
four key prenatal exposures: maternal depression, body mass index, infection, and blood glucose are associated
with connectivity and morphology of brain regions (e.g., dorsal anterior cingulate) involved in behavioral
regulation. In a subset of the cohort, we will also consider the potential mediating effects of inflammation and
glucocorticosteriods. I have a unique opportunity to pool data from cohorts of pregnant women-fetal dyads
involved in research studies (2004 to present; n~500) at Columbia University Irving Medical Center – a large
center with a diverse patient population – and perform new data collection harnessing health information
technology (e.g., electronic medical records). The data set will serve as a platform for my mentees to produce
pilot projects and manuscripts, and practical experience conducting a project in an area of PDN that matches
his/her career goals within the scope of this funding mechanism. My strong commitment to and ongoing research
in patient-oriented research focused on identifying early antecedents of psychiatric risk, individualized
mentorship plans, direct involvement of mentees in the conduct of research, and tailored career development
program at Columbia University Irving Medical Center are strengths of this application. The K24 mentees will be
uniquely positioned to discover neurobiological and behavioral pathways associated with risk."

The American Consortium of Early Liver Transplantation-Prospective Alcohol-associated liver disease Cohort
Evaluation (ACCELERATE-PACE) study is a prospective longitudinal cohort of patients with severe alcohol-
associated liver disease (ALD) evaluated for early liver transplantation (ELT). The cohort leverages the
ACCELERATE consortium with 4-linked R01s and 5 additional recruitment sites in the South/Southeast, Mid-
Atlantic, Midwest, and West, and will refine and identify best practices in the selection and management of
patients with severe ALD considered for ELT across their continuum of care. ALD is now the most common
indication for liver transplantation (LT) in the U.S. Historically, LT centers required at least 6 months of alcohol
abstinence before LT referral and evaluation, though empiric evidence to support minimum sobriety periods was
limited. ELT, defined as LT before 6 months of abstinence, is increasingly performed but with significant practice
variability. There is no consensus on optimal ELT candidate selection, and selection criteria vary widely,
contributing to disparities in access to lifesaving care. ELT is also controversial due to the potential for liver
recompensation with abstinence, which would obviate the need for LT—accurate prediction of recompensation
has the potential to increase organ utility and stewardship. Detailed evaluation of the efficacy of alcohol use
disorder treatments and improved risk scores based on pre-LT psychosocial factors to predict return to alcohol
use are needed to refine selection criteria, optimize post-LT care, and effectively treat AUD. Short- and
intermediate-term survival after ELT is excellent, but the incidence and predictors of post-LT complications are
poorly defined. To fill these key knowledge gaps, we will enroll and prospectively follow 770 ELT
candidates and 270 ELT recipients for 3 years at 9 socio-demographically diverse centers. The proposed
Aims will: (i) inform ELT selection criteria and investigate potential sources of bias in ELT evaluation and
healthcare disparities in ELT access; (ii) develop risk prediction scores for LT-free survival and recompensation;
(iii) identify effective treatments (medical, behavioral) for alcohol use disorder among patients with severe ALD
and post-ELT; (iv) evaluate clinical outcomes among ELT candidates and recipients, including mortality,
transplantation, post-LT complications (e.g. cancer, cardiovascular events, graft rejection/failure), and quality of
life. A comprehensive data repository will include sociodemographic, clinical, geospatial, psychosocial,
behavioral, and patient-reported outcome variables. LT documents, checklists, recordings of selection meetings,
direct observations of LT procedures, and clinician interviews will identify best practices and pitfalls in candidate
selection. A biorepository of blood, urine, explant/donor tissue, pre- and post-LT liver tissue, peripheral blood
mononuclear cells, and cross-sectional radiologic imaging will inform future ancillary studies."
10890758,"Project Summary
 Cellular and organismal homeostasis requires integration of diverse local and systemic cues by cell
signaling networks. The anabolic kinase mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) integrates nutrient and
growth factor availability, playing critical roles in cellular processes that modulate metabolism, tumorigenesis,
and immune function. mTOR comprises the catalytic core of two functionally distinct, multi-subunit complexes,
mTORC1 and mTORC2. Not surprisingly, aberrant mTOR function contributes to pathological states including
obesity-linked type II diabetes, cancer, and immune disorders. Despite the physiological importance of mTOR,
major gaps exist in our mechanistic understanding of mTOR regulation and function, particularly how mTOR
communicates with other important regulatory systems to control cell and organismal physiology. Recent work
from our lab provides the scientific premise for this proposal, which demonstrated that the non-canonical
innate immune kinase TBK1 (TANK binding kinase 1) phosphorylates mTOR (on S2159) to increase mTORC1
and mTORC2 signaling upon cellular stimulation with innate immune agonists (e.g., the viral dsRNA mimetic
poly(I:C); bacterial LPS), growth factors (EGF), or hormones (insulin) in cultured cells and in vivo (Bodur et al.
2018; Tooley et al. 2021). This work linked two physiologically important signaling systems not previously
known to communicate. Classically, TBK1 responds to microbial-derived signals to initiate first-line host
defense against viral and bacterial pathogens. These signals lead to phosphorylation and activation of TBK1,
which drives ]production of type I interferons (e.g., IFNb) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). More recent work
implicates TBK1 in a broader range of functions including improved glycemic control during diet-induced
obesity and tumorigenesis through poorly defined downstream mediators. We demonstrated recently that mice
bearing a “TBK1 resistant”, phosphorylation deficient Mtor S2159A allele display systemic insulin resistance
and hyperglycemia in the diet-induced obese but not the lean state (Bodur et al. 2022). Macrophages and
adipose tissue from these mice display reduced expression of IFNb and the anti-inflammatory ISG IL-10 as
well as elevated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Bodur et al. 2022). The overarching goal of this
application is to elucidate the regulation and function of TBK1-mTOR crosstalk in cells and in vivo. We will
employ biochemical, cellular, and molecular approaches to better define how TBK1 promotes mTORC1 and
mTORC2 signaling in the absence of microbial-derived signals (Aim 1). We will also investigate how TBK1-
mTOR signaling protects against insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and inflammation in the diet-induced obese
but not lean state by studying mice in vivo and primary cells in culture (Aim 2). This project will not only
elucidate basic mechanisms underlying control of TBK1-mTOR signaling but will also advance our knowledge
of mechanisms that integrate innate immune and metabolic signals to protect against obesity-linked metabolic
disease, in particular type II diabetes, a disease with growing and alarming prevalence worldwide."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of
cancer related deaths worldwide. Rates in Africa are on the rise, but essential histopathology services critical
for cancer care are scarce. To address this barrier, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning
(ML)-based computational pipeline (SIVQ/VIPR) that performs automated pixel-level image segmentation and
classification from digital images of routinely collected hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides. SIVQ/VIPR
is highly precise, reproducible, and outperforms subject matter experts. Once histologically distinct regions are
identified, image analysis algorithms can then identify individual regions and aggregate them to predict
diagnostic and prognostic features in conjunction with clinical outcomes to guide treatment. Our overall
approach is to leverage our validated SIVQ/VIPR computational pipeline to develop and validate an AI-based
diagnostic decision support (AI-DDS) tool for CRC diagnosis and prognosis in an existing Kenyan cohort. To
carry out this work, the Aga Khan University (AKU)- East Africa and the University of Michigan have partnered
with Tenwek Hospital, a non-academic community-based public hospital in rural Bomet, Kenya, to develop a
unique collaboration of oncologists, pathologists, surgeons, statisticians, and informaticians, making us
uniquely suited to develop population-relevant, affordable, and scalable data science solutions in Kenya – all
priorities of the DS-I Africa Program. We will: Aim 1. Adapt and validate an existing ML-based diagnostic
algorithm for CRC using digital fields of view from H&E-stained slides in a retrospective cohort of n=675 CRC
cases from the AKU and Tenwek Hospitals. We will apply the CRC-trained SIVQ/VIPR computational pipeline
for segmentation and classification for CRC features, followed by a confirmatory classifier step to achieve a
case level, binary result of a cancer/no-cancer (i.e., diagnosis). Aim 2. Develop and refine an unsupervised ML
method to identify histopathology image-derived measurements associated with CRC
prognosis.
We will use
computer/machine vision approaches to identify image features (e.g., cellular morphology) discriminative of
CRC prognosis and biological potential for disease aggressiveness. Combined use of AI-based morphological
signatures of aggressive disease (e.g., high-grade tumor architecture) will be compiled with other clinically
relevant features towards the goal of generating a multi-axial multiplexed AI-DDS tool that can maximally
inform of the biological and metastatic potential of each CRC case. This project will lay the groundwork for an
AI-DDS tool for clinicians (e.g., pathologists, oncologists) that facilitates prompt and accurate diagnosis,
prognosis, and risk stratification for CRC care in Africa. Because this approach leverages open-source
software and can be deployed as a turn-key system intended for web-based cloud deployment, it is well-suited
for capacity building, integrating into educational programs, and expanding to other emergent or prevalent
cancers (i.e., breast, cervical, prostate) as part of the DS-I Africa Consortium."

Organismal phenotypes in a given environment frequently differ from what might be expected based on
genotypic or environmental data alone. These genotype-specific deviations, or gene-environment interactions
(GxE), can constitute a large portion of phenotypic variation and are important for determining an individual’s
wellbeing in its given environment. An individual adapted to a particular environment can respond appropriately
to typical local stresses and nutrients, but may be maladapted in new or changing environments. GxE also
makes it exceedingly difficult to predict organismal response to the environment: the magnitude and direction
of GxE effects depend on the loci, alleles, traits, and environments involved. This complicates extrapolation of
genomic prediction models into new populations or environments. Although it is well established that GxE is a
major contributor to phenotypic variation, much less is known about the molecular mechanisms determining
individuals’ differential response to environments. This is particularly true in complex, real world environments
that are impossible to reproduce in laboratory experiments. Genomewide, allelic variation for gene expression
cumulatively influences GxE of organism-level phenotypes, but the complex networks and patterns of gene
regulation driving GxE are not well understood. Over the coming five years, this project will generate new
datasets and analyze existing datasets to begin understanding and modeling the genomewide patterns of
gene expression that cumulatively determine GxE in real world environments. In Aim 1, tissue samples
from multi-environmental experiments will be used to evaluate the landscape of gene expression among
genetically diverse individuals grown in a variety of environments. Specifically, we will investigate how changes
to cis-regulatory sequences (e.g. transcription factor binding motifs) contribute to GxE for gene expression.
Simultaneously, we will identify genes that show GxE for expression levels and model how they contribute to
GxE for organism-level phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will use existing datasets independent yet complementary to
those generated in Aim 1 to test whether GxE in organism-level phenotypes can be predicted directly from
sequence variation. Together the multi-scale projects in this study range from the sequence level to the entire
organism. By studying GxE at multiple scales and with a variety of different data types, this study will
strengthen our understanding of how allelic sequence variation changes gene regulatory networks and drives
local adaptation. These findings are important for understanding how organisms adapt to new environments
and for better predicting organismal response to the environment."
10873941,"SUMMARY
Carbohydrate-protein interactions mediate important processes in human physiology and pathophysiology, but
the study of these important interactions remains challenging and highly specialized. A major contributor to this
problem is the weak binding affinity of many carbohydrate-protein interactions, which limits the applicability of
many commonly applied biochemical and biophysical techniques (e.g., ELISA, ITC). This can be somewhat
rectified if natural or synthetic multivalent ligands can be utilized, but in many cases, molecules of this sort are
challenging to synthesize and/or isolate. The development of glycan microarrays has pushed the glycobiology
field forward by enabling numerous groundbreaking studies; however, this technology has yet to become widely
available and can only be utilized when a carbohydrate binding protein has been identified by other means. As
such there is currently a gap between discovery and downstream assays that needs to be filled to push the field
forward. In this proposal we are addressing this gap by developing tools that can identify carbohydrate-protein
interactions, using techniques that are widely available to the scientific community. The tools that we are
developing circumvent the challenge presented by the low affinity carbohydrate-protein interactions by covalently
labeling the carbohydrate binding protein in a carbohydrate directed manner. Here, we propose to: (i) advance
the utility of this approach; and (ii) apply this approach to ask important questions in biology and to target disease
relevant pathways."
10876988,"This proposal is a competing renewal for our longstanding T32, the Stanford Cancer Imaging Training (SCIT)
Program. Drs. Jeremy Dahl, PhD, and Bruce Daniel, MD, will lead this program, which features 25 mentors with
independent funding and 10 (7 internal/3 external) distinguished program advisors. This is a 2-year program
that trains 5 fellows (a mix of PhD and radiology-trained MDs) per year over a 5-year funding cycle. Our required
coursework includes 2 courses in the clinical/cancer sciences, 2 in imaging science, 1 in biostatistics, 1 in
medical ethics (“Responsible Conduct of Research”), 2 workshops in grant writing, an attendance at a minimum
of 4 multidisciplinary tumor boards, and regular attendance during a continuing education workshop that covers
topics in responsible conduct of research and rigor and reproducibility. In addition, trainees can select from a
multitude of electives offered by various Stanford University faculty across numerous clinical, science, and
engineering departments. Each trainee’s primary focus is a mentored cancer-imaging research project aimed
at publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at National meetings. We pair each trainee with both
a basic science and physician mentor, to provide guidance in course and research-topic selection and to develop
a translational mindset. Through the SCIT program, we will continue our longstanding mission of training the
next generation of researchers in the development and clinical application of advanced techniques for cancer
imaging. In addition, we will recruit trainees from a nationwide pool that includes women, candidates from
underrepresented minorities and/or with disabilities, and from disadvantaged backgrounds, so as to increase
diversity in the U.S. research workforce.
 The need for the SCIT Program is even greater now than when it began in 1993. Radiology plays a key role
in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients. Our Department is one of the very few that has been able to
grow in response to this role and embrace what is now a multidisciplinary vision towards image-based cancer
research. The SCIT Program leverages the Stanford Cancer Institute (an NIH-designated Comprehensive
Cancer Center) and the Stanford Canary Center for Cancer Early Detection as well as many other Stanford
resources and programs. All of our SCIT trainees were productive while in the program with nearly 90% who
continue research activity in cancer imaging today. Current trainees are pursuing research in radiology-
pathology fusion to predict treatment response of breast cancer, improving accuracy of prostate cancer
detection on MRI with deep learning methods, optical coherence tomography histology to decrease the positive
margin rate in lumpectomy for breast cancer, developing a partial ring time-of-flight positron emission
tomography scanner with 3D event positioning to visualize and quantify cancer lesions, AI-based detection
models to distinguish ductal carcinoma in situ from invasive breast cancer on pre-operative breast MRI, and
optimizing MR lymphangiography to maximize clinically relevant data and drive therapeutic innovation."

 California State University Los Angeles (Cal State LA), East Los Angeles College (ELAC), and Pasadena
City College (PCC) propose to deepen their collaboration to establish a T34 Bridge to the Baccalaureate (B2B)
Program. It is the mission of the B2B at Cal State LA to develop and make available to top biomedical PhD
programs the creativity and intellectual talents of our most motivated URM, disabled, and disadvantaged
undergraduates at ELAC and PCC; and to enrich the American biomedical research enterprise through their
participation. B2B Trainees will begin their training at ELAC and PCC; seamlessly transfer to and be integrated
into the Cal State LA Junior-Senior U-RISE Program to complete the baccalaureate; and excel as they earn
the PhD; establish high profile independent research careers; and assume leadership positions in science.
 We have reverse-engineered a two-year training program from the characteristics of highly successful
PhD students at major research universities, hypothesizing that growth into excellence as a PhD student has
its roots in the freshman and sophomore experience. Talented freshmen motivated for careers in biomedical
research will be supported and nurtured through lower-division majors at PCC and ELAC, coupled with
concurrent year-round laboratory research training at Cal State LA, taking advantage of the strengths of each
institution: the strong and supportive didactic environment at ELAC and PCC, and the strong undergraduate
research tradition at Cal State LA. This powerful combination is designed to increase B2B Trainees’ research
skills; enhancing their academic background and achievement; exposing them to a range of biomedical
sciences and scientists at all career stages; and integrating them into the broader Southern California
biomedical research community. Coupling B2B to U-RISE provides continuity of training effort and enhances
Trainees’ post-BS entry into top PhD programs. Through the T34 mechanism we can support year-round multi-
year participation in undergraduate research, replacing off-campus part-time work with research participation at
Cal State LA. Distributing their time between academics at ELAC/PCC and research training at Cal State LA
during the academic year is possible because of the proximity of the three campuses.
 The B2B at Cal State LA Program is composed of: 1) early and sustained participation in authentic year-
round mentored laboratory research; 2) a solid undergraduate curriculum enhanced by supplemental
instruction, and by attention to questioning; 3) workshops to enhance the curriculum; 4) improving the
Trainees’ scientific writing; 5) participation in an Annual Biomedical Research Retreat; 6) developmental
participation in seminars; 7) using support networks to enhance success; and 8) career advisement and career
awareness. We have experience, capacity, and achievements in developing minority talent for success in PhD
programs. In the past 15 years, 31 B2B alumni have earned the PhD and another 24 B2B alumni are currently
PhD students. Through the T34 B2B enhanced training, our three institutions can do significantly better."

 Microbes in natural habitats mostly exist in groups arranged in the 3D space of biofilms, and spatial
heterogeneity plays a key role in the stabilization, communication, and functions in these multi-species
consortiums. However, a proper platform to build a synthetic community of bacteria and systematically vary the
spatial parameter to deduce key fundamental knowledge in 3D microbial consortia – cellular phenotype,
differentiation, communication, gene expression, and metabolism – is currently lacking. My research program
aims to (1) develop a printing platform to construct 3D microbial consortia with well-defined polymers, (2) study
the physiology of cells confined in these 3D environments, and (3) engineer cells and their 3D arrangement to
yield biomaterials performing useful functions. The outcomes of our research endeavor will be (1) new
fundamental knowledge and understanding of microbial consortia with a 3-dimensional spatial context and (2)
functional biomaterials directly contributing to human health. Our contributions will be significant and have a
long-lasting impact by filling in the critical knowledge gap in our understanding and engineering capability of
microbial consortia relevant to biomedical science.   "
10889134,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Aerobic life on earth harnesses the oxidizing power of molecular oxygen (O2) through a diverse range of
enzyme cofactors and employs that high oxidation potential to mediate numerous oxidative transformations
during metabolic functions. Many of these cofactors are coupled binuclear sites consisting of two metal centers
such as copper and iron in close proximity. This proposal details fundamental research in the field of
bioinorganic chemistry and aims to address several intriguing questions about the potential roles of redox
aromatic active amino acids such as tyrosine and tryptophane chains in the enzyme mechanism and function.
 We identified three different classes of O2-utilizing copper enzymes including cytochrome c oxidase (CcO)
which reduces O2 to water, multicopper oxidase (MCO) which couples that reaction to four one-electron
oxidations of the substrates, and a new class of copper enzymes called BURP domain cyclases which catalyze
2-electron oxidative macrocyclization of the Tyr/Trp chains in peptide substrates.The use of O2 as either a
substrate or terminal electron acceptor has been established in these enzymes except for the BURP domain
enzymes which is yet to be confirmed.
In all three classes, appropriately tuned and positioned Tyr/Trp chains play different roles either as an
integral part of the active site (i.e., CcO) or they may be assigned a mediatory role to provide an alternative
path for oxidation of the more challenging substrates (i.e., MCO). They may even act as the direct substrate for
the active site (i.e., Cu-dependent BURP domain cyclases). In all cases, despite the diverse use of these
chains, their main function is to delicately supply the electron/proton needed for the O2 reduction. How are these
residues designed/optimized for a particular function? What are the similarities and differences between these
enzymes? Our studies aim to reveal the potential role of these Tyr/Trp chains play in enzymatic function and
mechanism and address some of the questions about copper biochemistry and aerobic metabolism."
10916552,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
The primary objective of this proposal is to examine an unintended consequence of depot medroxy-
progesterone acetate (DMPA) induced bone loss: increased circulating toxic metal lead levels. DMPA is an
important contraceptive option used by millions of women worldwide, including 54% of contracepting women in
Uganda. However, an established side effect of DMPA use is bone loss, with the greatest bone mineral density
(BMD) decline occurring during the first two years of use. We hypothesize that the skeletal effects of active
DMPA use increase the release of lead stored in bone to plasma, resulting in increased circulating lead levels.
Chronic exposure to lead is common worldwide, with high community lead exposure occurring in thousands of
locations across the U.S. and globally, including Uganda. As over 90% of lead from exogenous exposure is
stored in bone, bone becomes an endogenous lead source. Lead is mobilized to plasma, particularly during
periods of higher bone turnover and loss. Plasma contains the most biologically active fraction of lead in
circulation. No safe levels of lead exist; even at low doses, lead adversely affects all organ systems, due to its
ability to replace calcium ions. The DMPA-lead association has only been tested in two cross-sectional studies,
with both studies reporting an association. We propose to prospectively investigate DMPA use and circulating
lead levels by building on the NICHD-funded Kampala Women’s Bone Study (KWBS) (R01HD089843, PI:
Renee Heffron). KWBS, a 2-year longitudinal study of 499 women ages 16-25 years in Uganda, is investigating
the impact of concurrent initiation of DMPA and tenofovir HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) on bone loss.
Participants completed study visits every 3 months and were monitored with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry
(DXA) scans of BMD and trabecular microarchitecture annually and markers of bone turnover, estrogen, and
vitamin D at 5 time points over 24 months. Leveraging archived specimens, we will measure these markers at
4 additional time points to yield quarterly measurements. As lead measured in urine is indicative of bioactive
circulating (plasma) lead, we will measure urinary lead concentrations every 3 months over 24 months. We will
use this extensive data to achieve the following aims: (1) assess whether adolescent and young women
initiating DMPA (n=268) have higher circulating lead levels compared to condom users (n=231) over 24
months; (2) investigate the mechanism of bone remodeling and loss on lead release from bone to plasma with
DMPA use. We will examine in DMPA users and non-users quarterly bone remodeling indices, annual lumbar
spine and total hip BMD, annual trabecular bone score, and quarterly estrogen levels and lead level change
over 24 months; and (3) explore whether greater dietary calcium intake and sufficient vitamin D status reduce
skeletal mobilization of lead to plasma. This robust prospective study builds on NICHD’s commitment to
understanding the effects of contraception on human health, including DMPA-induced bone loss, and will
generate vital data to inform the provision of safer contraception in adolescent, adult, and lactating women."
10873718,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by infiltration of autoreactive T cells in pancreatic islets, leading to
autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells and diabetes. Initiation of autoimmunity and substantial
beta cell loss may begin years prior to symptomatic onset. Therefore, there is a crucial need to develop
diagnostics and therapeutic interventions directed towards this often-lengthy presymptomatic phase of T1D.
Limited success has been demonstrated in clinical trials for therapeutics directed towards presymptomatic T1D.
While anti-CD3 has shown promise, anti-CD3 only prevented diabetes onset in a subset of the study cohort and
is not directed specifically against T cells reactive to beta cell antigens, such as insulin. An approach that has
gained substantial traction in preclinical studies is the usage of peptide therapeutics to provide tolerance towards
antigens targeted by autoreactive T cells. Administration of insulin peptide therapeutics in mice has been shown
to prevent diabetes onset by expanding insulin-reactive regulatory T cells, which are anti-inflammatory and are
essential for proper immune tolerance and regulation. Despite their therapeutic potential, insulin peptides have
shown mixed results amongst different groups and have only been effectively administered via surgical
implantation of an infusion pump. Therefore, optimizing therapeutic efficacy through targeted delivery and
incorporation with diagnostics is warranted. This could be accomplished with ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs),
which are small gas-filled bubbles that can be visualized using contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and are
safe, easy to formulate, and clinically approved. A novel, submicron, ‘nanobubble’ ultrasound contrast agent has
been developed and prior work has demonstrated enhanced accumulation of nanobubbles in islets of mice with
presymptomatic T1D as a result of inflammation-associated microvascular permeability. My overall goal is to
develop and apply submicron UCAs to both target therapeutic agents specifically to the disease site and
track the effect of therapeutics on T1D progression. I hypothesize that submicron UCAs can be applied to
both predict therapeutic induced disease prevention and as vehicles for targeted peptide delivery. I will examine
this via two specific aims: I aim 1, I will predict therapeutic-induced disease prevention using submicron UCAs,
using CEUS to detect changes in islet accumulation of submicron UCAs following therapeutic intervention. In
aim 2, I will apply UCAs as therapeutic peptide delivery vehicles. Preliminary data indicates that peptide can be
incorporated into nanobubbles and nanobubbles can target peptide to islets. I will characterize effect of
nanobubble ablation on peptide cellular uptake characterize dynamics of peptide-nanobubble islet extravasation,
and assess immunological and disease-modifying effects of peptide-nanobubble treatment. Developing an agent
that allows for accumulation of therapeutic peptides in islets, enhanced therapeutic efficacy, and disease-
reversal-predicting diagnostics can serve as a major advancement in T1D prevention."
10974465,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Aggregated pathological tau protein constitutes one of the diagnostic hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and
related disorders (ADRD). The molecular mechanisms by which pathological tau causes dysfunction and
degeneration of neurons remain incompletely understood. However, pathological tau driven neuronal dysfunction
and neurodegeneration clearly cause dementia. To investigate how pathological tau contributes to
neurodegeneration in AD and ADRDs, we established a transgenic model in Caenorhabditis elegans for
neurodegeneration driven by human tau aggregation. By employing classical forward genetic approaches, we
identified several genes whose loss of function suppresses tauopathy, including spop-1. SPOP (speckle-type
POZ protein) is a conserved nuclear adaptor protein for the RING E3 ubiquitin ligase Cullin-3 (CUL3), selecting
proteins for degradation in the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). After generating a true null allele via CRISPR-
cas9, we found that loss of spop-1 dramatically decreases tau accumulation and phosphorylation without altering
tau mRNA abundance, rescues lifespan, reduces neurodegeneration, and improves behavioral deficits in tau
transgenic animals.
In addition to its role in UPS activity, SPOP also undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) localizing to
nuclear speckles (NS). Our previously work in C. elegans and AD neurons indicate disruptions to NS function
and composition contribute to tau toxicity. Remarkably, loss of spop-1 also rescues C9orf72 dipeptide-repeat
toxicity in a C. elegans model of genetic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar
degeneration (FTLD). Our preliminary results indicate loss of spop-1 suppresses behavioral deficits in C. elegans
expressing ALS-linked mutant TDP-43 as well as transgenics co-expressing TDP-43 and tau, which recalculate
AD and ADRD relevant interactions.
Altogether, our work led us to hypothesize that SPOP functions as a multipurpose regulator of proteinopathy in
AD and ADRDs. We hypothesize SPOP-CUL3 UPS activity and SPOP LLPS/NS localization contribute to the
underlying mechanisms of tauopathy. To investigate these hypothesizes the specific aims of this project are:
SPECIFIC AIMS: (1) Characterize SPOP loss of function in AD/ADRD neurodegenerative proteinopathies,
(2) Determine the mechanism by which SPOP loss of function suppresses tauopathy, and (3) Evaluate
the translational relevance of SPOP in Alzheimer’s disease.
By completing the proposed work, we will uncover new molecular understandings of disease mechanisms
including how SPOP protein – as well as nuclear speckles and Cullin-3 – participate in tauopathy and related
ADRD co-pathologies. This work will also provide insight into the translational relevance of SPOP in Alzheimer’s
disease brains, setting the stage for future study and informing the development of novel therapeutics."

The overarching goal of the New Mexico MU-NCORP is to improve the quality of cancer care throughout our
catchment area (the State of New Mexico) and to eliminate the tremendous burden of cancer health disparities
in the multiethnic populations that we serve by building innovative statewide outreach programs, founded in
community-based participatory research methods and scientific collaborations between community health
systems and providers with the primary academic affiliate site, resulting in an increased awareness, acceptance,
access, and participation by all New Mexicans in NCI-sponsored cancer screening, post-treatment surveillance,
prevention, and therapeutic clinical trials. The University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer (UNMCCC)
serves as the primary affiliate with strong scientific programs in cancer population sciences, cancer control,
health disparities, and clinical interventions, in partnership with nearly all New Mexico health systems and
community cancer care sites that are consortium members of the New Mexico Cancer Care Alliance (NMCCA,
secondary affiliate), a joint 501c3 statewide clinical trials research network that provides the major clinical trials
infrastructure to support the goals of the NCI NCORP. This NM MU-NCORP organization continues to engage
all stakeholders in our cancer health mission and builds upon a well-established 20 year partnership supported
in part by prior NCI MB-CCOP and current NCORP grants. This consortium has a proven track record and
success in enrolling New Mexico's highly diverse multiethnic, rural, and underserved cancer patients in NCTN
trials and has launched several cancer care delivery (CCDR) trials that are of great interest to our community
partners. The NM MU-NCORP will continue to be actively engaged in developing research strategies across the
NCORP Research Bases and will serve as working partners throughout the NCORP Network. With the highest
percentage of Hispanics and American Indians of any state, New Mexico's 2.1 million citizens are 39% non-
Hispanic White, 47% Hispanic, 10% American Indian, 2.4% Black, and 1.6% Asian and other ethnic minorities.
New Mexico ranks at the bottom (48th) in the U.S. in annual per capita income and a substantial number of New
Mexicans, particularly its minority populations, are poor, rural, and underserved. With the nation's highest rate
(30%) of childhood poverty, nearly 20% of all New Mexicans live in poverty and 10-13% of New Mexicans,
depending on the county, still lack health insurance. Our research strategy is focused on academic/community
team partnerships to address all aspects of cancer screening, prevention, cancer control, cancer care delivery,
and therapeutic intervention in order to prioritize and optimize trial-based cancer care, while enhancing
collaboration with the NCORP Research Bases in order to generate the next generation of trials to address the
cancer disparities of the New Mexicans served by the MU-NCORP."
10912455,"Hybridization between parasite species has the potential to transfer biomedically important genes across species
boundaries with potential impact on host specificity, pathogenesis and drug resistance. It is widely assumed that
there is frequent ongoing hybridization between the livestock parasite Schistosoma bovis and the human parasite
S. haematobium in West Africa: this has become a poster child for “one health” approaches to disease
management. Genetic crosses between these schistosome species can be conducted in the laboratory, and
multiple papers have described “hybrid” schistosomes between S. haematobium infecting humans and S. bovis
infecting cattle. However, a central issue with these field studies is that single mitochondrial and ribosomal DNA
markers are used to characterize parasite larvae. With this limited genomic resolution it is unclear whether
hybridization occurs frequently, whether it is rare and ancient, or if hybridization has never occurred and the
discordance results from ancestral lineage sorting. Our preliminary data are consistent with rare ancient
hybridization and subsequent introgression, rather than widespread, ongoing hybridization. We sequenced
exomes from miracidia collected from Niger and Tanzania revealing (a) no evidence for recent hybrids, (b) that
all S. haematobium from Niger carry 5-8% of S. bovis DNA in their genome (c) the size of introgressed S. bovis
fragments indicated ancient hybridization (100-600 generations ago) (d) that S. bovis DNA has risen to high
frequency some regions of the S. haematobium genome suggesting adaptive introgression. The central goal of
this application is to use genome sequencing, population genomics and experimental analyses to understand
the frequency and genomic consequences of hybridization between S. haematobium and S. bovis. We have
developed methods for whole genome sequencing from single parasite larvae from fecal samples or snails: In
Aim 1 we will examine 395 genome sequences of S. bovis and S. haematobium from archived parasite larvae
or adult worms from 14 countries from across Africa and from 10 states in Nigeria. We will use these data to
critically evaluate: (a) evidence for recent (F1 or F2) hybridization, (b) to determine how many times introgression
has occurred; (c) identify genome regions that are enriched or depleted in S. bovis alleles; and (d) to define
geographical regions in which introgression has occurred. In Aim 2 we will stage experimental genetic crosses
between S. bovis and S. haematobium in rodents to determine genomic and phenotypic consequences of
hybridization. In particular, we will determine genome regions involved in snail penetration of miracidia larvae
and skin penetration of cercariae to determine the impact of hybridization on host specificity. Finally, in Aim 3
we will examine both adult worms and eggs recovered from natural schistosome infections of West Africa rodents
to determine whether rare hybridization events may occur. The results will address fundamental and applied
questions concerning species boundaries, hybridization, host specificity and introgression in a biomedically
important and experimentally tractable parasite species."

knowledge and skills to support belonging, attitude, competence, knowledge, and skills by engaging trainees in
experiential research, personalized learning opportunities about science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM) careers (MD Track, PhD Track, or General Science Career Track), and avenues for
further training (i.e., graduate school, professional school), in addition to providing professional skills for
career advancement and tools for breaking down barriers, thriving, and resilience. We will draw on our
extensive background with the national recruitment and mentoring of trainees from URGs, leverage existing
MCW resources, and provide innovative diversity-tailored seminars and experiences in an inclusive, well-
resourced environment. With strong institutional support and excellence in cardiovascular research (ranked #13
of medical schools in funding from NHLBI), we will leverage our experienced multi-PI leadership, oversight by
an informed Advisory Committee, and culturally-aware, well-resourced faculty mentors to meet our intermediate
and long-term benchmarks of success: to enroll and train 13 sophomore, junior, or senior-level undergraduate
trainees from URGs each summer (65 trainees over the 5-year period of the award), provide tailored,
relevant, and cutting-edge training in research and professional skills, expose trainees to the multitudinous
career opportunities in STEM, enable trainees to present their research at a MCW research symposium at
the end of the 10 weeks of training (and if possible, at a national research conference the following year),
and for 80% or more of our ASPIRE graduates to complete their undergraduate degree in a STEM field,
more than 50% to apply to graduate school or other biomedical-related advanced degree programs, and
75% to obtain a first job in STEM. Overall, the ultimate goal of the ASPIRE Program is to inspire and fully-
equip our undergraduate trainees from URGs for future careers within STEM, especially in areas related to
cardiovascular research, thereby enhancing the diversity of the future biomedical workforce."

Melanoma is the most aggressive skin cancer and causes over 10,000 deaths per year in the US. While great
strides have been made in the treatment of melanoma, many patients are still non-responsive to immunotherapy.
Understanding the function of PD1 and LAG3 on the immune response in both the tumor and periphery of
patients is critical to the progress of immunotherapy in melanoma. Although LAG3 is the third ‘checkpoint’ to be
targeted with >10 agents in clinical trials, we still know very little about how LAG3 blockade, alone or with anti-
PD1, impacts the immune response to melanoma. We have demonstrated synergistic PD1/LAG3 combinatorial
immunotherapy in mouse models of cancer and clear evidence of clinical benefit from dual inhibitory receptor
(IR) blockade has stimulated anti-PD1 and anti-LAG3 trials in cancer patients failing previous immunotherapies.
Our overarching hypothesis is that LAG3 and PD1 single-agent blockades differentially regulate, and synergize
to promote, CD8+ T cell function in the tumor and peripheral blood of MPs and that a LAG3-dominant IR module
in peripheral CD8+ T cells downregulates patient response to PD1-targeted therapy.
Specific Aim 1. What is the mechanism of anti-PD1 (nivo) and anti-LAG3 (rela), alone and in combination,
on the phenotype and function of CD8+ T cells? We have initiated accrual in a unique biomarker-focused
phase II randomized clinical trial to evaluate the combination of anti-PD1 and/or anti-LAG3 therapy in treatment
naïve melanoma patients. We hypothesize that T cell activation and proliferation pathways are differentially
regulated in CD8+ T cells by anti-PD1 vs. anti-PD1/LAG3 and that unique synergistic molecular programs will be
revealed by this immunotherapeutic combination in treatment-naïve patients with metastatic melanoma. Our
novel trial design will assess the mechanistic impact of anti-PD1 and/or LAG3 immunotherapy in peripheral and
tumor CD8+ T cells.
Specific Aim 2. Does IL6 drive a LAG3-dominant IR module in peripheral CD8+ T cells, and does it predict
responsiveness to immunotherapy? We have recently made a series of novel findings regarding IR
expression in peripheral CD8+ T cells that implies a novel mechanism of immune resistance in melanoma
patients. We hypothesize that IL6-driven systemic immune dysfunction and subsequent resistance to anti-PD1
therapy is driven by a LAG3-dominant IR module and that this dysfunction can be ameliorated by anti-LAG3/PD1
blockade.
This project will [i] define new biomarkers of response and/or resistance to nivo, rela, and the combination;
[ii] potentially identify a patient population that will optimally benefit from LAG3-based therapies; and [iii]
develop novel combinatorial immunotherapies of increased efficacy in melanoma."

This project evaluates a novel combination immunotherapy approach applicable to a broad range of accessible
skin cancers. Specifically, we will target both a potent chemotherapeutic agent to induce immunogenic cell
death and an innate immune stimulant specifically to the 3D space of the tumor microenvironment (TME) of
cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCCs). This strategy is enabled by a dissolvable microneedle array
(MNA) device developed and produced in our laboratories. These studies represent the first tumor
immunotherapy clinical trials utilizing spatially and kinetically controlled delivery of a synergistically acting
combination therapy. This approach uniquely enables individualized patient-specific immunotherapy through
low dose localized drug delivery, obviating obstacles related to tumor and antigen heterogeneity and
reducing/preventing adverse effects associated with systemic exposure. Thus, the strategy could be applicable
to a large patient population, including those who are immunosuppressed or have or are at risk for autoimmune
diseases, as well as a broad range of skin cancers through a completely non-specific and generalizable MNA
“band-aid”-like delivery platform. Our hypothesis is that in situ MNA-directed immunotherapy (MNA-IT) will kill
tumor cells locally and induce a proinflammatory TME, enabling immune elimination of the treated tumor while
potentially inducing durable systemic immunity. It is supported by both preclinical studies and results from our
own clinical trials. To evaluate MNA-IT in patients with cSCCs, we will perform an iterative phase Ib/II clinical
trial evaluating MNA-IT single and combination therapies utilizing dissolving MNAs to deliver doxorubicin, a
STING agonist, or both directly to the TME of cSCCs. This will be evaluated in both immunocompetent
patients and in immunosuppressed transplant recipients. We will evaluate safety, clinical, and pathologic
responses, and explore therapy-induced changes in the TME and peripheral blood before, during, and after
therapy. Through forward reaching pre-clinical studies, we will develop a “next-generation” combination MNA-
IT to achieve sustained release of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the TME to support a sustained pro-
inflammatory TME favoring the induction of systemic tumor immunity."
10814173,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Quorum sensing (QS) is the process by which bacteria of the same species coordinate behavior at a high
population density. In many pathogenic bacteria, QS systems are used to regulate virulence. This proposal
focuses on the accessory gene regulator (agr)-type QS systems found in a several Gram-positive pathogens,
including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Clostridioides
difficile. Agr-type QS systems contain four proteins, AgrA-D, that together produce and respond to an
autoinducing peptide (AIP) signal. I will study the two proteins, AgrB and AgrD, that are responsible for signal
biosynthesis. In this pathway, the peptide precursor AgrD is processed by AgrB and an extracellular protease
to produce the AIP signal. In Aim 1, I will mutate the AIP region of S. aureus AgrD, testing to see if the AIP
signal is still produced. Through iterative rounds of mutation, I will determine where in the peptide and to what
extent variation is tolerated. Imbedded within this approach to understand the basic mechanisms of AIP
processing is two additional goals, one of which has already been realized. First, I have tested the ability of the
native system to produce non-native AIP analogs that act as potent inhibitors of S. aureus QS and have
demonstrated that two highly potent pan-group inhibitors of S. aureus QS can be biosynthesized using my
system. Second, by uncovering which residues of the AIP signal can be mutated without a loss of processing, I
can test the non-native AIP analogs produced for their ability to inhibit QS in S. aureus, potentially discovering
new and more potent inhibitors. For Aim 2, I will engineer a non-pathogenic bacterium to constitutively express
the QS inhibitors biosynthesized in Aim 1. Then I will test the probiotic strain’s ability to prevent S. aureus
pathogenicity in a Caenorhabditis elegans model. Aim 3 will continue to study the processing of AgrD but will
switch the focus to investigating the final step, wherein an extracellular protease cleaves the AgrD peptide to
yield final AIP signal. One mystery of this process is that AIP signals, even those within a single species, often
differ in their proteolysis site. To discover what drives this variability, I will make targeted mutations to AgrD
and compare proteolysis sites for the native AgrD sequence to mutant sequences. Applying this knowledge, I
will then biosynthesize designer AIP analogs that combine features from two or more native AIP signals.
Together these three aims will significantly increase our understanding of AIP biosynthesis and provide a novel
pathway to valuable chemical tools for inhibiting agr-type QS systems in major human pathogens."

The Radiopharmaceutical Therapy (RPT) market is projected to surpass the Technitium-99m market by 2025,
with an emphasis on metastatic prostate cancer, neuroendocrine tumors, and lymphoma. Driven by well-
tolerated treatments and fewer side-effects, experts have estimated 150 new theranostic centers will be needed
in the U.S. to deliver an estimated 50,000–200,000 treatment cycles/year. Currently, all RPT treatments
administer a standard therapeutic dose despite unique patient physiology and pharmacokinetics. From
experience with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), we know that patient-specific prescriptions based on
absorbed dose leads to better patient outcomes. A key technology required to enable this personalization is fast,
accurate, whole-body patient-specific dosimetry. In a prior Phase II SBIR, Voximetry was able to integrate our
fully benchmarked and IP-protected Monte Carlo dosimetry algorithm into a cost-effective RPT treatment
planning solution (TorchTM) by adding additional features such as image registration, contour propagation, and
voxel-based pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Torch was designed to model uptake and clearance routes of any
drug class (e.g., small molecules, peptides, antibodies) and any radionuclide, effectively adding a ‘swiss army
knife’ tool into the clinician’s RPT toolkit. Leveraging the gamma rays emitted by the RPT agent, Torch can
calculate how much radiation energy is deposited within each voxel of organs and tumors throughout the body.
Estimates of voxel-level whole-body patient-specific dosimetry are better correlated with response than the
standard uptake value (SUV) information that is clinically available today. Using this approach, Voximetry has
developed a fast, accurate, RPT treatment planning solution aimed to inform clinicians with extremely accurate
voxel-based Monte Carlo (MC) dosimetry in a matter of minutes. Additionally, Vox has developed a GPU
accelerated Monte Carlo SPECT reconstruction algorithm that leads to dosimetry estimates which differ from
conventional reconstruction algorithms by at least 25%, which is seen as clinically significant. This information
will support clinical decisions to personalize safe therapeutic doses. Automation of this RPT dosimetry workflow
is especially important for healthcare systems that would like to implement dosimetry-guided therapy in clinical
practice but are currently ill-equipped in terms of expertise and resources to perform advanced dosimetry for
RPT. By enabling automation, Vox will ultimately benefit cancer patients by making available a personalized
treatment that targets metastatic cancer that in many cases is more efficacious and has fewer side effects than
chemotherapy. The specific aims that will be accomplished in the proposal are to (1) Develop automated
segmentation tools for organs and risk and tumors using artificial intelligence, (2) develop scanner calibration,
partial volume correction, and Monte Carlo reconstruction to ensure accurate SPECT imaging, and (3) automate,
implement, and validate end-to-end clinical Torch workflow. The successful completion of these aims will help
break down barriers to commercialization and accelerate market adoption of Torch."

Aging is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Altered molecular signaling in age-related
markers leads to increased ROS, ER stress, autophagy defects, endothelial dysfunction and subsequently,
impaired vascular remodeling. However, the regulatory mechanisms, and the role of CSE/H2S signaling in
vascular remodeling and associated functions in aging are unknown. The current proposal will reveal novel
information regarding CSE/H2S regulation on endothelial function and aging vasculature by investigating the
hypothesis that endothelial-cell CSE deficiency in aging, and subsequently reduced H2S/NO bioavailability
impairs vascular remodeling. This hypothesis will be examined by two specific aims that 1. identify the molecular
mechanisms of reduced CSE/H2S deficiency in aging and 2. determine reduced endothelial CSE/H2S effects on
age-associated vascular dysfunction. The goal of this proposal is to generate preliminary data towards at least
two high impact peer-reviewed manuscript and submit my R01 by end of 2024."

The central hypothesis of this program project is that “Altered squamous epithelial integrity (Prj 1) and
inflammatory injury (Prj 2) activate signaling pathways including EPHB2 (Prj 3) that affect precursor cells
at the squamocolumnar junction (SCj) transition, esophageal submucosal gland (ESMG), and basal
squamous niches, resulting in the alteration of regulatory factors that include Notch, Myc, p63, and
SOX9, leading to acinar ductal metaplasia (ADM), multi-layered epithelium (MLE), Barrett's esophagus
(BE), and ultimately esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).” The Specific Aims of our program are:
1) To elucidate signaling pathways by which mutated VSIG10L alters epithelial integrity leading to MLE and BE
like metaplasia on novel mouse models.
2) To define the spatial and temporal pattern of CXCL8 (IL-8) in ESMG following esophageal injury and
phenotype the inflammatory infiltrate that leads to the development of acinar ductal metaplasia (ADM) in ESMG
associated with BE/EAC.
3)To identify mediators of EPHB2 signaling that lead to c-MYC activation and metaplastic cellular differentiation
after injury in the development of BE and its progression to EAC.
4) To define how altered epithelial integrity, inflammatory cells, and alteration of signaling molecules that control
differentiation (EPHB2) lead to metaplasia by altering transcription factors.
5) Integrate projects by providing investigators effective support through Core resources with state-of-the-art
Biorepository, Bioinformatics, and Administrative Services.
These objectives build and synergize on the considerable clinical, basic science, and translational expertise
available at our institutions, 1) to focus laboratory research on understanding the genetic susceptibility and
molecular changes that influence the development of BE and EAC; and 2) to then translate laboratory discoveries
into clinical applications for effective detection, molecular risk stratification, and prevention of progression from
BE to EAC."

Physical inactivity is associated with poor asthma control and quality of life, and greater health care utilization.
Rates of physical inactivity, asthma, and asthma mortality among African American (AA) women are higher
than those of their White counterparts. Our formative work identified barriers to PA among African American
women with asthma including a lack of social support, self-efficacy, unsafe neighborhood and fear related to
experiences with life-threatening asthma exacerbations. Given the unique barriers to PA and high rates of
physical inactivity that are associated with poor asthma outcomes in African American women, there is an
urgent need to optimize PA interventions for this population. The proposed study uses our theory-driven
intervention (ACTION: A lifestyle physiCal acTivity Intervention for minOrity womeN with asthma) to
deliver a 24-week lifestyle physical activity intervention designed for and by urban AA women with asthma.
Participants will be recruited through two urban health care systems that care for a diverse urban AA
population. Patients will be randomized to one of two groups: 1) ACTION intervention (group sessions,
physical activity self-monitoring and text-based support for goal-setting), or 2) education control (an individual
asthma education session and text messages related to asthma education). Participants will be followed for an
additional 24-weeks after the intervention to assess for the maintenance of intervention effects on asthma
health outcomes. We are proposing an efficacy study that focuses on asthma outcomes (Aim 1A/B), explores
behavioral mechanisms of the intervention (Aim 2) and assesses factors that influence its reach and
implementation potential (Aim 3). This trial will provide the first ever evidence of the efficacy of a lifestyle
physical activity intervention among urban AA women with asthma, a population that is understudied yet
plagued by low levels of PA and poor health outcomes. Our study has high potential to advance clinical
treatment of asthma, and further the mechanistic understanding of physical activity interventions in minority
populations living in low-resourced urban environments."

Human-associated microbes are causally linked to processes as diverse as immunomodulation, protection
against pathogens, and atherosclerosis. Many of these links are mediated through biochemical transformations
of dietary, drug, or host compounds. This makes the microbiome a promising therapeutic target, especially as
we could potentially affect downstream processes by controlling metabolic inputs. However, in order to
effectively intervene, we must first understand how exactly changes in these inputs lead to differential
regulation of growth, gene expression, and metabolism. This is challenging because our microbiomes are not
only genetically and physiologically diverse, but are also highly diverged from the most common model
organisms, with many genes of unknown function.
 Over the next five years, my research group will use a combined computational and experimental strategy
to characterize gene function, metabolic regulation, and microbial interactions in one of the most prevalent and
abundant clades of gut bacteria, the Bacteroidales. Specifically, we seek to determine 1) which Bacteroidales
genes are involved in growth on different nutrients and stressors; 2) how Bacteroidales genes are regulated,
and how this affects their metabolic outputs; and 3) how Bacteroidales interact with the other microbial
inhabitants of the gut. We will accomplish this by gathering high-throughput in vitro data from diverse sets of
microbiome isolates and synthetic communities, developing more powerful and specific statistical tools to
analyze these data, and using these new data and tools to re-analyze metagenomics data gathered from in
vivo case-control studies. I envision that this line of inquiry will provide missing fundamental knowledge about
this clade of microbes, which will ultimately help us interpret case-control studies of the microbiome and
support the development of more precise interventions."

The long-term vision of my lab is to elucidate biophysical principles of mesoscale assembly in biology and to
harness those discoveries for biomedical and biotechnological advances. In that vein, the lab’s current focus is
on elucidating principles underlying intracellular phase separation. Phase separation is a fundamental process
that cells use to organize their myriad biomolecules into functional compartments, giving rise to membraneless
organelles such as stress granules, germ granules, and the nucleolus, with important roles in gene regulation,
stress response, and many additional essential functions. Conversely, aberrant phase transitions are associated
with neurodegenerative and other diseases. The overall goal of this MIRA proposal is to establish how
biomolecular sequence and composition determine the material properties of membraneless organelles, and
how material properties contribute to biological function and misfunction. We will dissect the sequence features
and molecular interactions that determine the rheology (liquid-like, solid-like, or a combination) of biomolecular
condensates formed by phase separation of intrinsically disordered proteins. We will accomplish this using
protein engineering, mutagenesis, microscopy, a suite of biophysical techniques, and nanotechnology, including
the development of a toolbox of nanoparticle probes for measuring membraneless organelle rheology. We will
then investigate how membraneless organelle rheology underlies biological function, focusing on germ granules,
and we will investigate how perturbations to membraneless organelle rheology perturb biological function.
Finally, we will examine whether certain sequence features are particularly prone to aberrant liquid-solid phase
transitions and toxicity, indicating possible origins of pathology and targets for therapies. Together, this work
seeks to provide a strong foundation for understanding the links between molecular sequence, rheology, and
function of membraneless organelles in health and disease."

Multiple myeloma is a fatal plasma cell neoplasm that is characterized by the malignant expansion of abnormal
antibody-producing cells. Despite recent therapeutic advances, most patients eventually relapse. Such high-
risk patients typically have an overall survival rate of less than one year. These poor clinical outcomes occur as
a result of uncontrolled regeneration of malignant stem-like cells in protective, inflammatory
microenvironments. However, the precise transcriptional determinants of myeloma stemness in the bone
marrow niche remain poorly understood. One intriguing candidate is a key B-cell transcription factor and
myeloma cell survival factor, interferon response factor-4 (IRF4). IRF4 also governs normal plasma cell
development and immune responses to inflammation, however the extent to which IRF4 promotes malignant
progenitor generation in lymphoid or plasma cell neoplasms is unknown. A 50% reduction in IRF4 expression
can disrupt myeloma cell survival, but IRF4 remains undeveloped as a therapeutic target because transcription
factors are difficult to inhibit using traditional small molecule strategies. To overcome this challenge, proof-of-
concept studies were performed to evaluate novel RNA-targeted therapeutic agents that directly inhibit human
IRF4 RNA expression and protein translation. Based on extensive preliminary data that characterized IRF4
expression and activity in clinically-relevant in vitro and in vivo models, the central hypothesis of this project is
that inhibition of IRF4 will disrupt stem cell pathway activation in multiple myeloma and synergize with
standard-of-care drugs to reduce overall disease burden and prevent malignant stem cell generation. In the
context of three independent yet conceptually interrelated aims, this hypothesis will be tested in
comprehensive molecular and cellular assays through a rigorous scientific approach. Aim 1: Interrogating the
role of IRF4 in functional myeloma stem cell generation. This aim will determine the cell-intrinsic mechanisms
that link IRF4 to myeloma regeneration. Aim 2: IRF4 inhibitor monotherapy and combination drug treatment in
pre-clinical models of multiple myeloma. This aim will develop combination drug treatment and biomarker
detection strategies that leverage selective IRF4 inhibition. Aim 3: Elucidating the bone marrow
microenvironment-derived signals that promote IRF4 pathway activation in myeloma regeneration. This aim will
elucidate the paracrine mechanisms underlying myeloma regeneration and the activity of a novel cancer
therapeutic. The proposed research will set the stage for rapid clinical translation of more selective
combination therapies for myeloma. The research team unites cancer and stem cell biology experts, myeloma
clinicians, and collaborators who are highly experienced in the translation of novel therapeutics for cancer.
Together, this project is positioned to advance the rapid clinical translation of IRF4 inhibitor therapy for
myeloma. These investigations will also open up new avenues for targeting malignant stem cell generation in
other cancers and inflammation-associated diseases."

People who inject drugs (PWID) face multilevel barriers to accessing HIV-related services, including low
demand for services, resulting from stigma, low knowledge/awareness of services, and prioritization of
immediate basic needs (e.g., food, housing, addiction) over remote health concerns. In rural areas, these
barriers are exacerbated by service scarcity. Syringe service programs (SSPs), a cornerstone of HIV
prevention among PWID, are trusted by this population and have the potential to extend the reach of other
evidence-based services (pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP], medication for opioid use disorder [MOUD], HIV
treatment, etc.). Telemedicine provides a sustainable method to deliver services where they are scarce. We
successfully piloted telehealth delivery of HCV treatment and MOUD for PWID at rural SSPs. We will adapt
and expand on our telemedicine pilot to bring HIV prevention and treatment services to rural SSPs.
However, service availability does not equate to uptake. Social network-based interventions have proven
effective in disseminating health information and HIV risk reduction among PWID. Peer-based interventions
have an unparalleled potential to overcome stigma and trust barriers in marginalized groups, reach “hidden”
group members (i.e., those who do not access services at the SSP), and empower individuals to make positive
changes. Low rates of HIV testing and diagnosis among PWID remain a barrier to linkage to antiretroviral
therapy initiation (for HIV infected) and PrEP (for HIV-uninfected). A key innovation of our intervention will be to
combine dissemination of information with distribution of HIV self-testing kits through PWID networks. HIV
self-testing strategies are endorsed by the World Health Organization and have been shown to increase testing
coverage and new HIV diagnoses in high prevalence regions of sub-Saharan Africa and among MSM, but
have been little explored among PWID. We propose to evaluate a model that leverages peer educators to
disseminate HIV self-testing kits and information while also providing peer navigation to network
members for HIV prevention and treatment services uptake via telemedicine at rural SSPs
We plan a hybrid effectiveness/implementation approach. Aim 1a: We will use a community-engaged approach
to adapt a preexisting PWID-focused network intervention to a rural context with the goal of increasing HIV
self-testing and HIV service uptake. Aim 1b: We will determine the effectiveness of the intervention compared
with an equal-attention control condition, using a rigorous randomized trial design. Aim 2a: In contemplation of
adoption and sustainability, we will use mixed methods to characterize implementation processes and
outcomes. Aim 2b: to explore intervention mechanisms, we will establish the extent to which SSP and HIV
service uptake are related to experiences of social influence and stigma."
10931430,"With advances in cancer treatment, persons with distant metastatic cancer are now living longer. However,
their survivorship needs are not well understood. There has been little research focusing on survivorship in
persons living with metastatic cancer, despite increased recognition that their supportive care needs differ from
those with early-stage disease. There is an urgent need to conduct new longitudinal studies to address this
research gap and to build an evidence base for informing the development of multi-level interventions
specifically designed for persons living with metastatic cancer. Our application responds to this need by
proposing a prospective multi-site population-based study focusing on persons living with metastatic colorectal
cancer (mCRC). We will longitudinally assess patient-reported outcomes (PROs) including treatment-related
symptomatic adverse events (SymAEs) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). We will study adults (ages
≥18) diagnosed with mCRC because of their increasing numbers, sociodemographic diversity, and significant
symptom burden from established treatments and newly emerging therapies. To improve upon prior mCRC
research that focuses primarily on randomized trials of highly selected patients, we will recruit participants from
two population-based cancer registries (New Jersey and Greater California), which were chosen for their size
and sociodemographic diversity. The resulting data will be more generalizable to real-world delivery settings
and the broader population of those living with mCRC. We will enroll 1,600 mCRC survivors within 6-12
months of diagnosis, and survey them at baseline and 4-, 8-, and 12-month follow-up timepoints to
longitudinally assess changes in PROs over one year. We will augment self-reported data with information
obtained from cancer registries, medical record abstracts, and Medicare claims data. Most prior research has
reported on individual treatment related SymAEs, without documenting “clusters” of inter-related SymAEs that
are more commonly seen in practice. Therefore, in Aim 1 we will identify and describe treatment-related
physical SymAEs clusters, then examine variation by sociodemographic (e.g., age, sex, race-ethnicity, social
determinants of health) and clinical (e.g., cancer treatments, comorbidity) factors to identify high-risk
subgroups. In Aim 2 we will assess the relationship between SymAEs and PROs highly significant in mCRC
(i.e., physical, emotional, and social function that define overall HRQOL); cancer-related financial distress; and
psychosocial impacts of cancer. In Aim 3, we will explore potential intervention target variables. We will
investigate whether individual and healthcare system factors are associated with better PRO trajectories over
one year. Individual-level target variables include self-efficacy for managing cancer and social support.
Healthcare system factors include care coordination and integration, out-of-pocket costs, and experiences with
palliative care. Our project will build the knowledge base needed to inform multi-level interventions for
improving symptom management and HRQOL in persons with mCRC."

Signaling metabolites control various cellular processes, including cell cycle, differentiation, and adaptations to
environmental stimuli. Intracellular trafficking of signaling metabolites is crucial for maintaining cellular
homeostasis and integrate metabolic and transcriptional responses. Defects in metabolite transport and
distribution may lead to multiple diseases, including cancer, immunological, inflammatory, and metabolic
disorders. Subcellular compartmentalization allows the same molecules to partake in distinct biological
processes. Signaling metabolites generally act as second messengers for specific proteins or ligands for sensors
and nuclear receptors (NR), ligand-activated transcription factors that sense environmental signals and drive
cellular response. Because of their intrinsic reactivity, the intracellular levels of NR ligands, along with their
subcellular localization, are tightly controlled and may oscillate greatly depending on nutritional states and
pathophysiological conditions. Despite our understanding of their functions, our knowledge of how nuclear
receptor ligands travel across organelles remains limited due to the lack of specific tools to target such
mechanisms. We propose to integrate chemoproteomics, metabolomics, and cellular assays, to develop novel
chemical tools to interrogate the protein interactomes of NR ligands and identify their intracellular chaperones.
Leveraging these technologies, we intend to reveal the molecular and functional basis of intracellular trafficking
of signaling metabolites and identify dedicated protein chaperones that bind NR ligands at their site of synthesis
or entry into the cell, transport them to the nucleus, and deliver them to NRs. A driving finding of our preliminary
work was the discovery of PGRMC2 as an intracellular heme chaperone that transports heme from mitochondria
to the nucleus and regulates the transcriptional activity of heme-responsive transcription factors such as Rev-
Erb and BACH1. We will use the experience acquired from this initial work to extend our studies to the
identification of other transport mechanisms for known NR ligands, such as fatty acids, that activate PPARs, a
family of ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate metabolism and systemic energy homeostasis. The
second major goal of this proposal is to develop spatial- and time-resolved protein-metabolite maps, which we
expect to go beyond the identification of intracellular trafficking mechanisms and have a broader impact on the
field by providing a powerful strategy to study metabolite-protein crosstalk. Lastly, this project uniquely combines
our multidisciplinary expertise in transcriptional regulation, metabolism, and chemical biology to lead the
exploration of a new exciting findings in cell biology."
10907673,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood with significant morbidity including school absences,
poor school performance, parental lost workdays, emergency room visits and hospital admissions. The
majority of childhood asthma morbidity is due to medication non-adherence, and both morbidity and medication
non-adherence disproportionately impact low-income, Black, and Latino children.
School-supervised asthma
therapy ensures that children receive their preventive asthma medication daily at school and has shown
efficacy in improving medication adherence and asthma health outcomes, particularly in low-income and
racial/ethnic minority children. However, this strategy has not been widely adopted in practice to produce
meaningful public health impact. This is likely due to costly and resource intense protocols that have not yet
leveraged the established infrastructure of pediatric practices, schools, and families; groups that play vital roles
in the asthma health of children, yet largely work in silos. To address this gap, our team developed a new
model, Asthma Link, which partners pediatric practices, schools, and families to deliver school-supervised
asthma therapy. First, pediatric providers identify eligible children as part of their routine clinical practice and
send preventive medication orders to schools to initiate supervised asthma therapy. Next, families pick up and
deliver the asthma medication to school, and existing school staff supervise daily preventive asthma
medication use. This intervention leverages established infrastructure and requires minimal resources to
operate, enhancing sustainability in a real-world setting. Our pilot trial of Asthma Link showed improved
asthma symptoms when compared to an enhanced usual care condition, particularly among low-income, Black
and Latino children, and demonstrated trial feasibility. Moreover, we have adapted this intervention for real-
world use using input from diverse, multi-level community stakeholders. Asthma Link is now primed for an
effectiveness trial and rigorous process assessment. We propose a cluster RCT in 14 pediatric practices
(n=350 parent-child dyads) in two of the highest asthma burden cities in the nation, Worcester and Springfield,
Massachusetts. In Aim 1 we will determine the effectiveness of Asthma Link versus an enhanced usual care
condition in improving asthma health outcomes in school-aged children with poorly controlled asthma. Our
primary outcome is asthma symptoms (measured by Asthma Control Test scores) and secondary health
outcomes are adherence to inhaled corticosteroids, child and parent quality of life, emergency department
visits, hospital admissions, school absences, and parental lost workdays. Aim 2 of this study will explore the
implementation potential of Asthma Link by examining clinic, school and family-level measures of fidelity and
acceptability using mixed methods and the Proctor framework. Data collected will inform a future nation-wide
implementation trial. If proven to be effective, Asthma Link could become the standard of care for children with
high-risk asthma, with the power to transform practice, even within limited resources."

Cirrhotic stage liver disease is the 11th leading cause of mortality in the US, and no treatment exists for late-
stage disease other than liver transplantation. Thus, the overall objective of this proposal is to elucidate novel
mechanisms that drive the release of fibrogenic signals leading to liver fibrosis progression and to guide the
development of potential treatment strategies. Liver fibrosis is characterized by the activation of hepatic stellate
cells (HSCs). Our preliminary data in primary human and mouse HSCs as well as in vivo demonstrate that 1.
platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF) induces metabolic reprogramming by increasing glycolysis; 2. PDGF-
mediated glycolysis increase the transcriptional activation mark, histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) on the
promoter region of vesicle trafficking-related Ras-related protein Rab (RAB) genes; 3. glycolysis promotes EV
release and enrichment with fibrogenic proteins; and 4. in vivo glycolysis inhibition by HSC-selective hexokinase
2 (HK2) deletion abrogates liver fibrosis. We have utilized our novel findings to generate the CENTRAL
HYPOTHESIS of the current proposal that PDGF-mediated glycolysis in HSCs induces fibrogenic EV
release through H3K9ac-dependent transcriptional upregulation of RABs to amplify liver fibrosis. We will
employ sophisticated cellular and animal models, including in vitro and in vivo utilization of dCas-KRAB model,
in vivo HSC-specific HK2 deletion model as well as acetyl-coA-deficient HSCs, to investigate the following
integrated, yet independent aims. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that PDGF increases glycolysis through
lysine-deficient kinase 1 (WNK1) phosphorylation to mediate glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) translocation to the
plasma membrane. We will uncover the kinase signaling leading to glycolysis in HSCs by: a. studying how PDGF
increases glycolysis through phosphorylation of WNK1, a novel PDGF downstream lysine-deficient kinase; and
b. investigating how WNK1 phosphorylation promotes GLUT1 translocation to the plasma membrane to increase
glycolysis, which represents a new mechanism in HSCs. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that glycolysis
leads to EV release by upregulating the transcription of RABs through acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA)-mediated
H3K9ac. We will dissect how glycolysis drives epigenetic regulation of vesicle trafficking gene program to control
EV release by: a. studying how PDGF promotes the accumulation of the metabolite acetyl-CoA to increase
H3K9ac; and b. examining how H3K9ac promotes RAB transcription to induces EV release. In Aim 3, we will
test the hypothesis that HSC-specific glycolysis and subsequent epigenetic regulation of fibrogenic EV release
amplifies in vivo liver fibrosis. We will investigate the mechanism of in vivo liver fibrosis amplification by: a.
studying how glycolysis-mediated EVs amplify liver fibrosis by targeting HSCs; and b. investigating how the
disruption of epigenetic regulation of RABs ameliorates liver fibrosis. This novel and innovative line of inquiry
will define an HSC-specific glycolysis-dependent model of liver fibrosis amplification and set a trajectory towards
new and significant advances to treat liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in humans."
10841579,"SUMMARY: Myocardial Physiology of Growth Differentiation Factor Signaling
 GDF11 and the closely related protein GDF8 (also known as myostatin) can regulate cardiac
hypertrophy. We now have new prospective data in a large cohort of coronary heart disease patients showing
that low blood levels of subforms of GDF8 and GDF11 powerfully predict future all-cause mortality. These new
data point to specific forms of GDF11 and GDF8 as critical factors in heart disease. Furthermore, human loss-
of-function mutations in GDF11 have now been identified that cause multi-system disease, including
cardiovascular disease, showing the importance of GDF11 in human biology. GDF11 and GDF8 are members
of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) superfamily of extracellular ligands and were initially thought to
serve similar or redundant roles due to protein sequence identity (90% identical) within their mature signaling
domains. We recently collaborated with multiple other laboratories to determine that mature GDF11 is a
significantly more potent activator of SMAD2/3 dependent signaling than GDF8 in vitro, likely due to better
utilization of key signaling receptors. Moreover, through x-ray crystallography-guided biochemical experiments,
we identified key amino acids of the two ligands responsible for their differences in potency. These findings
support the concept that GDF11 and GDF8 are likely not functionally equivalent, especially when ligand
concentrations are low, as exist in vivo. However, it is not yet understood if differences in GDF11 and
GDF8 at the molecular level translate to distinct functional outcomes and pathway activation in vivo.
 Defining the roles of these ligands in vivo can best be addressed by genetically engineered mice. Using
CRISPR technology, we have now generated three new lines of mice with specific changes guided by our
structural and biochemical studies on GDF11 vs. GDF8 to address this Project’s three Aims. This project will
uncover the biochemistry of these ligands in vivo while retaining regulatory structure of the endogenous
genomic loci. Importantly, we have already used Targeted Locus Amplification to prove that we have edited
only the intended amino acids in all three of the new lines of mice. Using these newly generated mice, we will
pursue the following Aims:
 Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that introducing the mature domain of GDF11 into the myostatin (GDF8)
locus regulates cardiac size and function using Gdf8Gdf11swap mice.
 Aim 2. To test the hypothesis that gain of potency in GDF8 with two specific amino acids from GDF11
regulates cardiac muscle growth in mice (Gdf8G89D/E91Q mice).
 Aim 3. To test the hypothesis that GDF11 potency is required to maintain cardiac muscle function in
vivo under pressure overload using chimeric mice with specific amino acids from GDF8 introduced into mature
GDF11 (Gdf11D89G/Q91E mice)."
10895409,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
DNA nanotechnology offers near-atomic control for building structures, with precise positioning of guest
molecules such as antibodies, fluorophores and ligands that make them potentially useful in a number of
biological applications such as biosensing, drug delivery, cell modulation and bioimaging. However, there are
still many challenges that need to be addressed for DNA nanotechnology to reach its full potential for practical
applications. In this proposal, we focus on two main areas of development in DNA nanotechnology to address
these challenges: (1) Creating a robust, multifunctional drug delivery platform for treating multisystemic diseases,
and (2) designing 3D DNA crystals as scaffolds for X-ray structure determination and characterization of such
3D lattices using the new technique of Serial Femtosecond X-ray Crystallography (SFX).
For drug delivery, we will develop DNA polyhedra as drug carriers for delivering a new class of modified polycyclic
compounds (MPCs) to multiple organ systems and enhancing drug candidate screening using myotonic
dystrophy type 1 (DM1) as a testbed disease. Our work will provide quantifiable loading of these minor groove
binding drugs and thorough validation of drug delivery efficiency from cell culture to preclinical DM1 mouse
models, establishing cell internalization, lack of toxicity and immune response, cell- and disease-specific
targeting, bioavailability and biodistribution of the drug-loaded DNA nanostructures.
For developing DNA nanostructures as structural scaffolds, we will design and construct DNA motifs that
assemble into 3D DNA crystals with different cavity sizes that allow hosting guests of different sizes ranging from
nanoparticles to proteins. We will improve resolution of the crystals by programming crystal contacts and
incorporating chemical modifications and demonstrate macromolecular scaffolding of proteins using triplex
forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) as tethers and peptides using PNA linkers. We will develop methods to grow
microcrystals of these DNA motifs for structural analysis using SFX, where diffraction data is collected using high
intensity X-ray free-electron lasers, that eliminate the need for large single crystals, freezing, and radiation
damage associated with traditional crystallography.
This proposed research extends beyond a single disease or health issue, making this work well-suited for the
R35 Maximizing Investigators’ Research Award (MIRA) at the NIGMS. In the long-term, I envision that our
modular, platform technology using DNA nanostructures can be adopted by other labs for different disease
treatments and drug screening (drug delivery) and to obtain crystallographic information of hard-to-crystallize
molecules (macromolecular scaffolds)."
10878941,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Childhood cancers require lifelong risk-based follow-up care tailored to their treatment exposures,
including routine medical appointments, monitoring for late effects, and regular cancer screenings. Unfortunately,
less than 1 in 5 adult survivors of childhood cancer obtain such risk-based follow-up care. The transition from
pediatric to adult follow-up care for adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors is a critical period when many
survivors are lost to follow-up, particularly AYA survivors who identify as Hispanic or have low self-efficacy to
manage their care. While the barriers to care are well-characterized, there are no efficacious interventions to
help improve this transition for AYA survivors of childhood cancer.
 To address this gap, we developed Managing Your Health, a digital self-management and peer mentoring
intervention to improve survivorship care self-management. It consists of six 1:1 virtual sessions with a peer
mentor, another young adult survivor who independently manages their own care. Each session involves
discussion of a complementary web-based self-management educational module. Peer mentors act as
supportive accountability agents, providing specialized support based on shared experience and facilitating
engagement with the modules. Our preliminary two-arm randomized feasibility trial showed that survivors found
the intervention useful, were highly engaged, and reported significant improvements in self-management. Per
participant feedback, we translated the web-based modules into a mobile app for easier accessibility. The goal
of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of Managing Your Health (app + peer mentoring) compared with
educational control in a two-arm randomized trial with 300 young adult survivors of childhood cancer currently
aged 18-25 years. We will oversample for AYA survivors who identify as Hispanic given evidence of low self-
efficacy and follow-up care in this group. Participants will complete outcome measures at baseline, 3 months,
and 12 months post-randomization, with medical record abstraction for guideline-concordant care at 12 months.
Specific aims will evaluate the efficacy of the intervention on self-management behaviors, quality of life, and
adherence to guideline-concordant follow-up care, as well as mediators and moderators of treatment effects.
The proposed research aligns with priorities detailed in the notice of special interest “Navigating Pediatric to
Adult Health Care: Lost in Translation,” and seeks to address gaps in the long-term health care of childhood
cancer survivors by evaluating an innovative theory-based intervention to facilitate the transition from pediatric
to adult self-management of care."
10896444,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) kills over 30,000 Americans every year and has a dismal 5-year overall
survival rate of less than 7%. However, SCLC outcomes are greatly improved by early detection and intervention,
with a nearly 50% 5-year survival rate for patients diagnosed at an early stage. These discrepant outcomes
indicate that, by far, the majority of SCLC cases are diagnosed at later stages at which tumors rapidly become
resistant to therapy, with death quickly following. Thus, an effective early detection strategy is necessary that
both identifies cancer in people at high risk and facilitates non-invasive imaging that can confirm and delineate
small tumors to guide surgical resection and treatment. We have found that autoantibodies (AAb) are present in
the plasma of essentially all SCLC patients (much more common than in other major cancers) and have validated
at least 7 AAb-identified neoantigens expressed by SCLC tumors that can be exploited as highly cancer-specific
early detection biomarkers and/or imaging targets. We envision an early detection/diagnosis platform performed
during the recommended annual low-dose computed tomography (LD-CT) lung cancer screenings for heavy
smokers. However, LD-CT and all current imaging modalities are not suitable for SCLC early detection even in
smoking enriched populations due to lower than required sensitivity/specificity and risk/benefit analyses. Here,
we propose a two-tiered approach, with a blood test that detects the presence of AAb specific for SCLC that
would trigger immuno-positron emission tomography (immunoPET) imaging utilizing a radioimmunoconjugate
that specifically targets the autoantigenic proteins expressed only on SCLC tumors. The blood test ensures that
only high-risk individuals are screened and the immunoPET confirms and localizes the tumor for future treatment.
Thus, in Aim 1, we propose to define the role of SCLC-specific autoantigens (AAg), isolate human B cells specific
to the AAg, test the AAg as highly sensitive and specific early detection biomarkers, and sequence the AAb
variable regions and clone them into expression vectors to produce human monoclonal recombinant antibodies
for imaging purposes. In Aim 2, we propose to perform immunoimaging of SCLC tumors using fluorophore- and
radionuclide-labeled AAb immunoconjugates specific for these cancer targeted neoantigens/epitopes.
Preliminary data for the 2 antibodies that we have tested so far show that they specifically bind to SCLC tumors
in preclinical models, underscoring the feasibility of the entire pipeline. In summary, we will combine AAb-AAg
early detection for risk stratification with immunoPET imaging to confirm and localize tumors, thereby establishing
an early detection pathway capable of reducing the mortality of this highly aggressive cancer."
10927306,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Ribonuclease L (RNase L) is a key component of the mammalian innate antiviral response. For decades, RNase
L was presumed to reduce viral protein synthesis by cleaving ribosomes to arrest translation. However, we and others
recently demonstrated that RNase L-cleaved ribosomes are translation-competent, and that pathogenic viruses can
synthesize proteins despite activating RNase L. These observations have revealed a significant gap in knowledge
regarding how RNase L functions and how viruses evade it. We have demonstrated that RNase L rapidly degrades nearly
all cellular mRNAs upon activation. This activity regulates three cellular processes that have expanded our understanding
of RNase L and that have elucidated how pathogenic viruses evade and potentially hijack RNase L functions. First,
RNase L reprograms translation to an antiviral state by degrading constitutively expressed cellular mRNAs while
sparing host mRNAs encoding antiviral proteins (e.g., type I interferons), which permits antiviral protein synthesis.
Importantly, the mRNAs encoded by several pathogenic viruses (e.g., dengue virus) similarly evade RNase L-mediated
mRNA decay, thus permitting viral protein synthesis. This observation has elucidated how pathogenic viruses synthesize
proteins despite activating RNase L. This application proposes to characterize the RNase L-mediated mRNA decay
pathway and determine how host and viral mRNAs evade it. Second, RNase L activation triggers the inhibition of nuclear
mRNA export. This is a critical antiviral mechanism that antagonizes influenza A virus protein synthesis, but it also
downregulates the expression of host antiviral proteins (e.g., type I interferons). Importantly, pathogenic viruses (e.g.,
dengue virus) activate this RNase L-dependent pathway, resulting in sequestration of host antiviral mRNAs in the
nucleus. This observation suggests that viruses potentially hijack this function of RNase L to limit host antiviral protein
production. This application aims to determine how RNase L inhibits mRNA export, the breadth of viruses it antagonizes,
how it impacts host antiviral gene expression during pathogenic viral infections. Third, RNase L regulates the assembly
of cytoplasmic antiviral ribonucleoprotein complexes. Specifically, RNase L inhibits the assembly of stress granules and
promotes the assembly of an alternative stress granule-like ribonucleoprotein complex termed RNase L-dependent body.
RNase L-dependent bodies are the predominant antiviral granule assembled in response to SARS-CoV-2 or dengue virus
infection, yet their function is completely unknown. This application aims to determine the function of antiviral stress
granules and RNase L-dependent bodies and to determine how their regulation by RNase L alters the antiviral response.
Understanding the mechanisms and functions of these cellular processes will advance our understanding of the
OAS/RNase L pathway, innate immune antiviral gene induction, and virology. Moreover, it will promote general
medicine by broadly characterizing fundamental cellular, molecular, and RNA biology that is relevant to non-infectious
diseases, including autoimmune diseases, neurodegeneration, and cancer. Lastly, the proposed research will support the
development of promising antiviral, immunomodulatory, and anticancer therapies based on RNase L biology."
10880685,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Objective: We will develop an advanced photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) breast imaging system
capable of detecting anatomical and functional changes in breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant therapy
(NAT).
Significance: NAT improves outcomes in breast cancer patients by increasing the likelihood of breast
conservation, providing important prognostic information, and enabling adaptive therapy such as change in
systemic treatment and de-escalation of surgery in exceptional responders. As such, identification of
responders enables personalized cancer treatment.
Challenges: Current breast imaging does not sufficiently detect breast cancer treatment response. Standard
of care (SOC) breast imaging technology either assesses anatomical details or metabolic function, not both. In
addition, ionizing radiation, exogenous contrast agents, and patient perceived discomfort and inconvenience
usually restrict imaging frequency required for timely evaluation of response. For example, although dynamic
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is considered the SOC in breast imaging, this test
is limited by the need for intravenous heavy metal contrast, duration of study, patient discomfort, and high
resource costs while delivering only moderate accuracy in detection of NAT response. As such, there
is
no
reliable,non-invasive, cost-effective imaging method to identify treatment response.PACT is an emerging
technology with great potential to address these problems by imaging both function and anatomy without
exogenous contrast.
Solutions: Capitalizing on our experience and success in building two PACT breast imaging systems, we
propose the construction and clinical testing of an innovative PACT imaging system that integrates the two
previous systems to enable both anatomical and functional imaging. The Dual Mode PACT (DM-PACT) will
combine dual-sided light delivery, large-view detection aperture, and dense acoustic sampling for rapid
functional and high-resolution anatomical imaging to assess treatment-related responses in breast cancer. The
imaging features generated by the DM-PACT will be first characterized and correlated with the
histopathological results of the resected breast cancer specimens from patients treated with NAT. A diagnostic
model using the imaging features will be trained and tested in a larger group of breast cancer patients treated
with NAT. We will compare the performance of DM-PACT with the performance of SOC DCE-MRI in treatment
response discrimination. The success of this project will result in imaging technology that directs response-
driven, personalized breast cancer treatment plans."

 The overall objective of this work is to develop and apply a droplet microfluidic system to facilitate rapid
engineering of enzymes to synthesize drug molecules. Development of new medicines requires synthesis of
complex molecules from initial lead compounds for testing. Once a drug is identified, efficient synthesis is
needed for clinical trials and ultimately widespread production. Traditionally such syntheses utilize metal-based
catalysts. Enzyme and cell-based systems offer numerous potential advantages including greater selectivity in
installing functional groups, greener reactions, more efficient catalysts, and low toxicity. Creating biocatalysts
with the desired selectivity requires enzyme engineering. The potential of enzyme engineering is seen in the
awarding of a Nobel Prize in 2018 and uptake by pharmaceutical manufacturers. Enzyme engineering requires
creation and isolation of thousands of enzyme variants, incubation of substrates with variants, screening of the
variants for reaction activity, and identification of variants for further mutation and evolution. Current methods
for engineering that use robotics, well plates, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry are time and
resource intensive thus limiting the use in medicinal chemistry. Droplet microfluidics has potential to profoundly
improve enzyme engineering through greater speed and substantially reduced materials requirements. In
these methods, individual enzyme variants are encapsulated into droplets, screened for product formation, and
sorted based on signal. The low volumes required (< 10 nL/reaction) and high-throughput (over 1000
samples/s) are dramatic improvements over current well-plate methods. However, early demonstrations of
enzyme engineering by droplet microfluidics are impractical for development of biocatalysts due to a reliance
on fluorescence detection in screening. We propose to create droplet microfluidic enzyme engineering systems
that utilize mass spectrometry (MS)-based detection, offering the potential for label-free and information-rich
screens at high throughput. In preliminary work, we have developed “mass-activated droplet sorting” (MADS)
which can sort enzymes expressed in vitro based on their activity detected by MS. We will build on this
achievement to create a versatile system with advanced analytical measurements for enzyme engineering.
 Many enzyme engineering protocols call for expressing the variants in microbes, therefore we will
develop tools to allow individual microbe strains to be grown in single droplets and sorted by MS. Prior work
has relied on direct analysis of droplets by MS; however, this precludes separations of isomers and can be
vulnerable to matrix effects on signal. We will expand analytical options by interfacing droplets to rapid LC-MS
and ion mobility-MS to offer separations of isomers and matrix before MS detection. The system will be used to
engineer pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes for the diversification of amino acid substrates and
cytochrome P450s that mediate intermolecular oxidative C–H/C–H coupling reactions to form C–C bonds."

Nondaily smoking is an increasingly prevalent pattern of smoking with substantial health detriments. Currently,
25% of all U.S. adult smokers are nondaily smokers, and this prevalence has increased by 27% in the last
decade. Formerly believed to be a transient pattern of smoking, research has established that nondaily
smoking is often a persistent pattern. Nondaily smoking is more prevalent among Black and Latinx persons in
the United States and is increasingly prevalent among people with serious mental health issues. Despite
substantial harms associated with nondaily smoking, the U.S. Clinical Practice Guidelines for smoking
cessation offer no guidance on how to support nondaily smokers in smoking cessation due to a lack of
evidence for efficacious approaches. A continued failure to address nondaily smoking widens existing health
disparities at an increasingly accelerated rate. Empirically supported interventions are critically needed. Only
two trials to date have targeted nondaily smoking cessation. Both focused on pharmacological options, and
both failed to show efficacy in achieving smoking abstinence. Our team has developed a behavioral treatment
for nondaily smokers: the Smiling Instead of Smoking (SiS) smartphone app. This app utilizes positive
psychology exercises to enhance engagement of nondaily smokers and to maintain positive affect while they
undergo a quit attempt. This approach is based on nondaily smokers' preference to focus on positive self-
identity and wellness, and evidence that shows that greater positive affect is associated with increased self-
efficacy to quit smoking, decreased desire to smoke and greater readiness to process self-relevant health
information, all of which are constructs highlighted in dominant health behavior theories as causal agents in
successful behavioral change. In collaboration with nondaily smokers, we have rigorously and iteratively
developed and tested this app in a series of small-scale studies. This work has demonstrated the app's ability
to engage nondaily smokers, and has shown proof-of-concept efficacy in a small, randomized trial, where
participants using the SiS app had significantly higher self-efficacy, lower craving and higher positive affect at
the end of treatment, compared to controls. We now propose to test the efficacy of this app to improve 6-month
abstinence in a large-scale, single-blind, remote, parallel, randomized clinical trial comparing the SiS app to the
NCI's app “QuitGuide”. All participants will be asked to set a quit date and to use the provided app for 7 weeks,
1 week prior to and 6 weeks after their quit date. Online surveys will be conducted at enrollment and 2, 6, 12,
24 and 52 weeks after the initially chosen quit date. The primary outcome measure will be 30-day point
prevalence abstinence 6 months post quit. If found to be efficacious, this study would provide the first evidence
of an efficacious treatment for nondaily smokers, for whom currently no treatment guidelines exist."
10929383,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Behavioral analysis of individual cells that determines the structural phenotypes in response to the mechanical
stimuli or cell migration is important in organogenesis or tissue morphogenesis. Dynamic cell tracking, migration
trajectory monitoring, or temporal changes in cell shape or size are essential for modeling cellular interactions.
However, optical limits imposed by microscope objective lenses and light attenuation in tissue hinder high-
resolution evaluation of cell physiology on the dimension scale of μm to nm. Hence, several super-resolution
fluorescence modalities have been developed in recent years to enable nanoscale tissue characterization and
less damage to tissue histopathology. On the other hand, isotropic nanometer optical resolution for super-
resolution modalities is restricted to micron scale field-of-view (FOV). This physical limitation reflects in vivo
characterization up to cellular events only. Therefore, we propose to develop an advanced optical imaging
technique to achieve sub-cellular resolution, while providing user capability to modulate millimeter to centimeter
FOV for in vivo monitoring. Light-sheet fluorescent microscopy (LSFM) has emerged as a popular optical
sectioning modality in biomedical research, owing to rapid camera frame rates in conjunction with long working
distance excitation optics. Although LSFM provides intermediate-to-high resolution images, the resolution is
highly dependent on the confocal range of the excitation objective. To overcome this challenge, we propose to
apply the rolling shutter (RS) based-axially sweeping LSFM technique to de-couple the dependence of light sheet
FOV on excitation numerical aperture (NA). RS is a type of image capture in sCMOS camera that record the
frame line by line on an image sensor instead of capturing the entire frame all at once to improve signal-to-noise,
but it can create some unintended image distortions. Thus, we will incorporate the application of maximum
likelihood estimation as a post-acquisition restoration strategy to remove optical distortions introduced by RS
image acquisition to ensure isotropic lateral and axial nanometer resolution. After the acquisition, we will segment
and extract information on cell motion and morphology using a feature detector framework based on the Hessian
difference of Gaussian in combination with the watershed algorithm. The feature detector has been validated to
separate adjacent clustered cells in 3D undergoing rapid motion with high sensitivity. In addition, we will further
train our segmented cell images for deep-learning network and use for automatic segmentation and tracking.
The proposed microscopic technology will enable the quantitative characterization of cellular behavior effectively
in arbitrary FOV."

Each adult human harbors hundreds of bacterial species in their intestine. However, the networks of microbe-
microbe interactions that underly the stable co-existence of resident species, and exclude additional species,
are not well defined. The intestinal lumen is a turbulent, semi-fluid landscape where microbial cells and dietary
plant cell wall fragments are distributed with high heterogeneity, and redistributed on the time scale of seconds.
We propose that bacteria selectively adhere to dietary particles in the gut lumen and that interactions with their
co-adherent microbial partners dictate whether they persist. We created multiplex libraries of artificial food
particles (consisting of glycan-coated magnetic beads) to measure gut bacterial adhesion in vivo, and
discovered that many members of the phylum Bacteroidetes adhere to dietary glycan particles in a strain-
specific and glycan-specific manner. We will first identify families of adhesion proteins required for these
binding phenotypes using transposon mutagenesis and insertion site sequencing. Next, we will identify
networks of interacting strains that co-adhere to dietary particles. Using orally administered libraries of
fluorescently labeled beads, we will map co-adhesion networks in gnotobiotic mice colonized with strains that
have evolved together in a single donor host. Finally, we will establish a mutational selection strategy that
permits the simultaneous generation of different binding specificities in genetically intractable gut microbes.
Analysis of these mutations will reveal the potential origins of adhesion-dependent interspecies relationships.
These studies will shed light on the poorly defined spatial structure of the gut microbiota. The technologies we
develop in this proposal hold promise as a means to intentionally position the members of microbial
communities in physical configurations that prevent or ameliorate metabolic, immunologic, and infectious
diseases."
10892160,"The initial stages of vertebrate embryo development proceed in the absence of transcription.
Consequently, protein abundance of preimplantation embryos is regulated by post-transcriptional
gene expression programs. In particular, new protein synthesis is required for productive
embryogenesis as inhibition of translation prevents activation of the zygotic genome and leads to
arrested development. Despite this critical function, translational dynamics in single mammalian
embryos have remained unexplored due to technological limitations. To address this critical gap and
technological need, we propose to comprehensively and quantitatively determine the dynamics of
translational control during early mouse development at single nucleotide and single embryo
resolution. The proposed research will apply a transformative technology that my lab developed
enabling the measurement of translation in single preimplantation embryos. In this study, we will
determine allele-specific ribosome engagement of mRNAs and characterize the underlying
mechanisms. The proposed study will be significant as it will be the first transcriptome-wide
characterization of translational control in preimplantation mammalian development at single embryo
resolution and will reveal how the early embryo executes specific gene expression programs to shape
its proteome."

solid organ and bone marrow transplant patients. Toxoplasmosis causes death and severe disability world-
wide and individuals with AIDS are at increased risk of developing toxoplasmosis. First-line antifolate therapy
has a high rate of adverse effects that compromise use for treatment and prophylaxis. Antifolates also fail to
reduce established brain tissue cysts. A safer, more effective therapy for acute toxoplasmosis and prophylaxis
that reduces or eradicates tissue cysts is sorely needed. Endochin-like quinolones (ELQs) are remarkably
potent inhibitors of T. gondii replication that are highly effective in mouse models of acute and latent infection.
ELQ-422, an ELQ-316 prodrug, markedly increased survival in a mouse model of toxoplasmosis. ELQ-316 and
its prodrugs reduced the number of brain tissue cysts in mice, and further reduction occurred with the addition
of pyrimethamine. ELQs bind to either the QO site (ubiquinol oxidation) or the Qi site (ubiquinone reduction) of
the T. gondii cytochrome bc1 complex (cyt bc1). ELQ-316, a Qi site targeting compound, has been selected for
preclinical advancement based on outstanding efficacy and selectivity for the parasite cyt bc1 over the host.
ELQ-422 is a prodrug of ELQ-316 that is rapidly converted to ELQ-316 in vivo resulting in a significant increase
in oral bioavailability. ELQ-422 appears safe based on toxicity testing in rats. Based on this and other
preclinical testing, ELQ-422 stands out as a highly promising lead compound that should be advanced toward
clinical studies. Additionally, despite decades of clinical use and extensive preclinical exploration of cyt bc1
inhibitors as anti-parasitic agents, key questions remain regarding the effect of cyt bc1 inhibition on parasite cell
biology. Answering these questions would provide insight into mechanisms of parasite persistence and
treatment. The aims of this proposal will (1) discover drug targets that are synergistic with cyt bc1 inhibition (2)
carry out a mechanism-based drug screen to identify inhibitors that enhance ELQ-316 efficacy and test lead
compounds in a model of latent toxoplasmosis."
10922725,"Summary
Airborne particulate matter with a diameter of <10µm (PM10) is a major global airborne pollutant, with an irritant
effect on mucous membranes, causing serious health (cardiovascular and respiratory) and economic
outcomes. Pertinent to our studies, clinical evidence has shown that exposure to PM10 is linked to increased
emergency room visits for keratitis and dry eye and conjunctivitis exacerbate the problem. Unfortunately, no
studies have mechanistically investigated the effect of PM10 on the eye and the link/mechanisms leading to
increased microbial infection. Therefore, the long-term goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that in the
cornea, PM10 triggers reactive oxygen species (ROS), disrupts nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)
signaling, leading to inflammation and that this in turn enhances the disease response to bacterial infection. A
corollary to this is that inhibition of ROS by SKQ1, a novel mitochondrial targeted antioxidant, will reverse these
changes. Preliminary in vivo data showed that airborne exposure of mice to PM10 vs ambient air results in
disruption of the Nrf2 pathway, lower levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), and elevated mRNA levels of COX-
2, iNOS, IL-6 and TNF-α, decreased protein levels of Nrf2, and increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA),
the latter indicative of lipid peroxidation. We also showed that PM10 exposure exacerbates Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) infection in the mouse cornea with earlier perforation and corneal thinning
compared with ambient air exposed mice. In vitro, human corneal epithelial cell cultures support these findings
and show that PM10 adversely affects cell viability and that SKQ1 rescues it. Three aims are proposed:
Specific Aim 1: Tests the hypothesis that PM10 exposure triggers ROS, disrupts the Nrf2 signaling pathway,
decreases cytoprotective genes and leads to corneal inflammation; and that SKQ1, an antioxidant and inhibitor
of ROS, reverses these effects.
Specific Aim 2: Tests the hypothesis that PM10 exposure exacerbates bacterial keratitis and that SKQ1 alone
or as an adjunct treatment to Moxifloxacin improves disease outcome.
Specific Aim 3: Tests the hypothesis that PM10 exposure of human corneal epithelial cells parallels the mouse
data in that it induces ROS, Nrf2 signaling, decreases cytoprotective genes and that SKQ1 reverses these
effects."
10895386,"This T32 renewal application aligns with the mission and values of The University of Texas at Austin’s (UT
Austin) Steve Hicks School of Social Work (SSW) and Dell Medical School (DMS) by providing a mechanism
by which to enhance the pathways of future leaders historically underrepresented in the sciences toward
careers dedicated to eliminating social and health inequities in cardiovascular and lung disease. The specific
aims of the program are to: 1) recruit and provide rigorous scientific training to a cadre of developing scientists
from under-represented groups in order to increase diversity in the pool of highly-trained scientists prepared for
a career in cardiovascular and lung research focused on health equity, and; 2) foster an environment at UT
Austin for inter-professional development in cardiovascular and lung research. This renewal application
proposes to continue to train 10 postdoctoral fellows from under-represented groups for two years in the SSW
and DMS. In addition, it proposes to expand the program to train 2 predoctoral fellows from under-
represented groups in the SSW. With involvement from 34 mentors in the Schools of Social Work, Medicine,
and Nursing, the Population Research Center, and the College of Pharmacy, fellows will be trained in
community-based participatory research methods and population health science. They will implement
evidence-based interventions and/or produce scientific evidence with the ultimate goal of increasing health
equity in heart and lung diseases and their behavioral risk factors (e.g., dietary habits, physical activity,
adherence, tobacco use/exposure, metabolic syndrome, obesity, sleep). Key innovations include recruitment
and mentoring activities firmly grounded in the reality that cultural and racial/ethnic diversity in the scientific
workforce is critical to the production of innovative scientific knowledge, a team-based mentoring approach
with a near-peer mentoring component, the cross-fertilization of social work and medical trainees. The
DMS is uniquely designed to promote population health and the SSW is rooted in an equity lens and has a
strong community-based focus. Furthermore, the Schools have established a very successful and close
partnership. Fellows will further their research training through formal mentorship, formal coursework,
seminars, conferences, and other career development activities. Each fellow will have a primary mentor
assisted by other mentors in a team-based approach, and a network of near-peers (postdoctoral fellows for
predoctoral fellows and assistant professors for postdoctoral fellows) who will also contribute to mentoring.
The Principal Investigators/Program Directors, Drs. Yessenia Castro, Catherine Cubbin, and Elizabeth Matsui
will provide overall management of the program. An Advisory Committee, including external members, will
assist them in the administration and evaluation of the program and its outcomes."
10871696,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs) are highly prevalent radiologic findings that represent a substantial
burden to patients and the national health care system because of the diagnostic challenge they present.
There is a dire need to accurately stratify IPNs into low and high malignancy risk subgroups which are
associated with clinical management pathways that are standardized and well validated. Clinical prediction
models have the potential to do so in a scalable, cost-efficient, automated, and noninvasive manner, but
advances in predictive accuracy must be made before they can make a substantial impact in medical practice.
An unexplored direction in this area is integrating repeated measures of computed tomography (CT) studies
and clinically-collected information within the same prediction model. This joint learning strategy has advantage
of potentially modeling how dynamic radiologic changes like nodule growth rate vary with the trajectory of
clinical variables such as smoking patterns and laboratory abnormalities. This perspective motivates the
hypothesis that integrating information from longitudinal imaging and longitudinal clinical records will
improve personalized IPN risk stratification and lung cancer subclassification From a clinician’s lens,
this finding would not be surprising given the many time-varying modalities that are involved in diagnosis and
decision making. This project leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and radiomic methods to analyze three
retrospective cohorts with the possible addition of a large prospective cohort. The proposed work in Aim 1 will
extend upon existing deep learning techniques to train a joint learning model on longitudinal images and
clinical records to estimate the malignancy probability across time in patients with IPNs in a combined cohort
exceeding 2000 subjects. This novel strategy will be evaluated against single-modality models and convention
models that are used in practice. The evaluation will compare the models’ performance in stratifying IPNs into
the low and high risk subgroups as a measure of clinical utility. Aim 2 asks if longitudinal change in radiomic
features can distinguish between indolent and aggressive lung adenocarcinoma, other lung cancer subtypes,
and pulmonary metastases. The proposed study will be the first to comprehensively characterize longitudinal
radiomics across lung cancer subtypes and has the potential to identify novel longitudinal radiomic features
that will aid early IPN evaluation and noninvasive lung cancer subclassification in patients with repeated
imaging. In summary, the proposed research asks if clever integration of longitudinal information across
different modalities can be leveraged to advance IPN risk stratification and lung cancer subclassification. This
fellowship will be conducted at Vanderbilt University in a highly collaborative training environment with mentors
in medical imaging AI, pulmonary oncology, biomedical informatics, radiology, and biostatistics. The proposed
research and training plans are synergistically designed to ultimately prepare the candidate for a physician
scientist career at the intersection of engineering innovation and precision oncology."
11007159,"Project Summary
Many of our most impressive skills, such as those supporting extreme athletic talent or precise musical
expression, are learned by imitating the skilled performance of a tutor. To successfully imitate a tutor, a pupil
must generate a range of behaviors, evaluate them relative to an example of the tutor, and then reinforce those
that are similar to that example. The generated behaviors are often highly elaborate and produced without any
source of comparison other than the pupil's internal template. As such, imitative learning depends intimately on
the pupil's ability to evaluate and reinforce its own performance in the absence of any extrinsic reward or
instruction. The brain mechanisms that support imitative learning remain poorly understood, although it is well
known that the basal ganglia (BG) play a central role in classical forms of reinforcement learning. How the BG
evaluates and reinforces behavioral variants over the course of imitative learning remains uncertain. In my
research I will characterize the relationship between neural activity in the BG, behavioral exploration,
and reinforcement during imitative learning. My Specific Aims are: 1) To model the imitative learning
process by which songbirds explore subsyllabic structure within song. 2) To jointly model vocal variability and
BG circuit activity during song learning. Aim 1 will advance our understanding of the behavioral mechanisms of
vocal learning and develop computational frameworks for understanding complex learning processes, while
Aim 2 will relate neural variability in the BG to vocal variability during these learning processes. The analyses
and models I create in this proposal will both provide insight into the song learning process in zebra finches
and create a more general framework for studying complex skill learning. I will conduct this research under the
supervision of Drs. John Pearson and Richard Mooney, a team of accomplished, interdisciplinary mentors with
complementary skillsets. Their collaboration has already proven to be fruitful. I will work closely with members
of the Mooney lab to hone our scientific questions, refine our experimental design, and develop our analyses.
In doing so I will build a balanced set of theoretical and experimental skills. I bring a deep passion for
understanding complex behavior on both behavioral and neural scales, in addition to expertise in behavioral
and computational methods. The experience I gain from this proposal will make me a competitive and
independent investigator, accelerating me towards my long-term goal of obtaining a faculty position at a
research institute."

Torie Grant, MD, MHS is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics and Medicine at Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine. Dr. Grant seeks a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award
in order to obtain the skills, knowledge, and mentored research experience that are the essential foundation for
a career as an independent clinical investigator studying pediatric determinants of adult lung disease. Dr.
Grant's career development plan includes the pursuit of a PhD in epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins
Bloomberg School of Public Health. Her mentorship team includes established physician scientists with
decades of research and mentorship experience: Dr. Robert Wood (co-primary mentor) has over 30 years of
pediatric asthma research and mentoring experience; Dr. Elizabeth Matsui (co-primary mentor) has been the
PI of multiple pediatric asthma studies focusing on environmental exposures; Dr. Robert Wise is an expert in
pulmonary function testing and asthma clinical trialist; Dr. Corinne Keet is an expert is asthma epidemiology
and environmental risks for asthma and allergic diseases; Dr. Allen Everett is an expert in biomarker discovery;
and Dr. Roger Peng is an environmental biostatistician with expertise in environmental exposures and health
outcomes.
Current pediatric asthma therapies are effective in achieving asthma control, but have little effect on the
progression of asthma into adulthood. Emerging evidence suggests that indoor allergen exposure may have
deleterious effects on lung function trajectory from childhood to adulthood among allergen-sensitized children
with asthma. Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to examine the long-term effects of indoor allergen exposure and
sensitization on lung function growth and risk of adult obstructive lung disease. Aim 2 will examine the effects
of indoor allergen exposure reduction on lung function growth. Aim 3 will explore the relationship between
indoor allergen exposure reduction and hypothesis-driven biomarkers of pulmonary fibrosis and remodeling.
These aims will add critical knowledge to our understanding of the role of indoor allergen exposure in lung
function growth, conceptualizing allergen reduction as a disease-modifying therapy. Dr. Grant's background as
an internist, pediatrician, and allergist-immunologist, with training in epidemiology and biostatistics, makes her
the ideal candidate to study adult lung function outcomes in pediatric asthma."

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Dementia-Alzheimer’s Type (DAT) prevalence is growing among older adults,
and disproportionately so in Black seniors. Scientific advances have allowed for detection of protein
biomarkers associated with AD and increased risk for DAT. Both cognitively healthy and symptomatic older
adults are interested in their personalized PET amyloid and tau information. However, biomarker disclosure
rarely occurs in either clinical or research settings, in part due to concerns about how patients will react to and
use this information in the absence of validated treatments for DAT. While several studies have supported the
safety of positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid disclosure in regards to psychological reactions, very
few have examined actual behavior following risk feedback, and no studies have examined a prolonged
timeline of behavior change. The therapeutic effect of health behavior and lifestyle change on cognition and
functioning is well-established; however, whether disclosure may precipitate health-related change is unknown.
Furthermore, no study to date has investigated tau disclosure. These questions are most pertinent to two
populations: patients with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI), for whom this feedback may be most
motivating, and Black individuals, who may face biopsychosocial barriers to executing adaptive health related
changes, even if motivated to do so. To date, no study has systematically addressed racial differences in
reactions to risk disclosure or the mechanisms underlying these differences. This empirical gap highlights a
timely opportunity to understand and address a potential source of disparity in AD diagnosis and treatment.
The proposed project and closely aligned training plan will respond to this call by comparing behavior change
in individuals who receive either ‘standard of care’ diagnostic disclosure, or diagnostic feedback enhanced by
disclosure of combined PET amyloid and tau imaging. We will build from the robust framework of the Michigan
Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center’s (MADRC) longitudinal cohort and two associated NIA-funded studies
to recruit a biomarker-characterized and rigorously diagnosed sample of 50% Black and 50% White patients
with aMCI. This sample will be randomly assigned to treatment condition, and then followed for bi-annual visits
over two years. Specifically, we will use a mixed-methods approach to assess health behavior change (Aim
1a), advanced planning (Aim 1b), and research participation (Aim 1c), as well as how a known social
determinant of health (healthcare access) influences change in these outcomes by racial group (Aim 2). The
training in AD biomarker measurement and validation, ethical and public health implications of biomarker
disclosure, racial-ethnic disparities in aging, and mixed methods approaches, in addition to the critical concepts
explored in this study, will create the ideal foundation for the principal investigator to excel as an independent
early career researcher in the field of minority cognitive aging."
10909203,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease caused by aberrant T-cell mediated targeted destruction of
insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, resulting in loss of blood glucose regulation, with increased long-
term risks of vascular and neuropathic comorbidities. Despite the fact that T1D is one of the most studied organ-
specific autoimmune diseases, the various strategies aimed at intervention, prevention, or reversal of this
disease have failed to succeed due to incomplete knowledge about the precise mechanisms of their action, as
only peripheral assessments of systemic impacts (e.g., circulating cytokine changes, C-peptide levels) are
feasible. This lack of mechanistic understanding of these interventions, as well as substantial time and cost of
clinical trials, is a profound obstacle in improving therapeutic outcomes. To address these significant knowledge
gaps, there is a substantial clinical need to develop human-based ex vivo systems capable of intimately studying
the interplay of islets and immune cells, as well as the contribution of environmental factors on immune cell
activation, homing, and cytotoxicity. The primary hypothesis of this proposal is that the development of an islet-
immune platform has the potential to provide unique insight into T1D, with investigation of activation pathways
and screening of interventional approaches. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to engineer, validate, and
utilize a unique in vitro 3-D platform for the interrogation of human T1D immunopathogenesis by converging
innovative cells with biomaterials, in situ imaging, and microphysiological systems (MPS). Aim 1 will seek to
establish and validate this 3D biomaterial-based co-culture platform. To validate the system, a tiered approach,
building from single antigen murine model cells to human T1D-antigen cells, will be employed. Once validated,
Aim 2 will translate this platform to study human-centric T1D-relevant pathways and interventions. Finally, Aim
3 will seek to integrate spatial and fluidic features by translating the 3D material to an established
microphysiological system (MPS) platform, which will permit the study of T cell migration from a fluidic
microenvironment to the beta cell niche. Results from this proposal should provide a validated and enabling tool
for the study of human T1D-relevant pathophysiology, interventions, and therapeutics. While the proposed field
of application for this platform is T1D, other autoimmune diseases can benefit from this engineered benchtop
platofrm, as they share homologous hallmarks of immune cell dysregulation."
10901985,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The trypanosomatids cause a broad range of severe human illnesses across the entire world. The
success of these parasites stems in large part from their ability to adapt their cellular morphology to suit the
environments within their mammalian and insect hosts. The extensive range of observed cellular morphologies
rely on a set of microtubules that underlie the cell surface, known as the subpellicular array. These microtubules
are heavily crosslinked and remarkably stable, but very little is known about how the array maintains its
organization or how it duplicates during cell division. During a recent proximity-dependent biotinylation screen in
Trypanosoma brucei, we identified two proteins that are essential for shaping the array and assuring that it is
duplicated correctly during cell division. The first, an orphan kinesin named Kinesin Localized to the Ingressing
Furrow (KLIF), is essential for the segregation of the array into two distinct units at the end of cell division. KLIF
is a very effective microtubule bundler in vitro, which suggests that its primary function is to organize microtubules
within the array to form a new cell posterior by gathering microtubule plus-ends into a pole. The other, called
Posterior And Ventral Edge Protein 1 (PAVE1) is a component of microtubule crosslinks present at the posterior
portion of the array and is essential for tapering the array to produce the parasite’s distinctive shape. This
proposal will use these proteins to understand how the subpellicular array is assembled and maintains its shape.
 In Aim 1, the precise track KLIF takes as it ingresses along the furrow will be established using super-
resolution and live-cell microscopy. We will study the KLIF RNAi phenotype using EM and live-cell imaging to
determine the specifics of the microtubule organizing defect. Full-length KLIF will be expressed to test its
oligomerization state and function. In Aim 2, the microtubule-binding properties of PAVE1 and its interacting
partners will be studied using biophysical approaches. PAVE1 preference for microtubule plus ends at the cell
posterior will be probed using a pulse-chase strategy in conjunction with treatments that alter microtubule
dynamics. In Aim 3, immunoprecipitation and proximity-dependent biotinylation will be employed to map the
interacting partners of both KLIF and PAVE1 so that the pathways involved in subpellicular array biogenesis can
be established. This work will further the fundamental understanding of how trypanosomatids establish and
transmit their complex cellular morphologies, which are essential parts of their biology. Pathways involved in
these processes that are unique and essential may be potential targets for further drug design."
10804612,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Degenerative rotator cuff tear (DCT) is among the most common causes of shoulder pain, yet little is known
about the genetic and physical risk factors for these tears. Contrary to prior belief that DCTs were fully
attributable to repetitive microtrauma, new evidence has emerged on intrinsic tendinous abnormalities that
could predispose DCT risk. Obesity and diabetes are common health conditions associated with intrinsic
tendinous changes (such as tendon fat and aberrant microstructural fiber composition, as well as increased
tendon cell death and abnormal nutrient vessel anatomy) and may contribute to predisposing conditions that
promote rotator cuff injury. Several epidemiologic studies link obesity and diabetes with cuff disease. However,
most are limited in their scope to establish causal links in part due to inconsistent definitions of cuff disease,
lack of temporality between exposure and outcome, and biases inherent to these studies. The objective of the
proposed work is to leverage several large international DNA and patient health databases, as well as an
ongoing prospective cohort, to evaluate causal roles of diabetes and obesity on DTCs, by incorporating
methods rooted in instrumental variable analysis (Mendelian Randomization [MR]) which can overcome
traditional challenges faced by previous studies. For my first aim, I will build, validate and compare two
algorithms to classify cases and non-cases of DCT. These algorithms will be appropriately matched and
applied to a variety of international biorepositories with genetic data that linked to electronic health records
(EHR). Using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for DCT generated from these sources, and
GWAS data on obesity and diabetes traits from published studies, I will evaluate evidence for causal
relationships between diabetes and DCT (Aim 2), and obesity and DCT (Aim 3) using MR techniques.
Additionally, I will determine the potential mediating role of diabetes on the association between obesity and
rotator cuff tear using two-step MR methods. DCT is a debilitating condition with great long-term morbidity.
With the ever-increasing rates of diabetes and obesity in our population, conclusions drawn from this work (null
or otherwise) will be timely and impactful. Together, this work taps into unknown and understudied
musculoskeletal consequences of diabetes and obesity, and will inform approaches to mitigating risk of injury,
opening the door for future studies on treatment and prevention of DCT in these populations."

Fatigue, lack of physical and/or mental energy, is a common reported symptom with osteoarthritis (OA) that
may limit physical capacity and contribute to disability. In healthy older adults, muscle fatigue has been
proposed as a key contributor to symptoms of fatigue. Knee extensor muscle dysfunction, including lower
isometric and isokinetic torques and altered muscle activation patterns, are common with knee osteoarthritis
(KOA). Together these changes in neuromuscular function may increase locomotor muscle fatigue in KOA
compared to age-matched controls, as a greater percentage of the muscle’s capacity must be used for daily
activities such as walking. To date, evidence to explain whether and how muscle fatigue may alter control and
coordination of movement in KOA is limited. Our working hypothesis is that KOA-related neuromuscular
changes may exacerbate locomotor muscle fatigue (Aim 1) and alter the neuro-mechanical response to muscle
fatigue during gait (Aim 2), thereby contributing to mobility declines. In healthy adults, central and peripheral
mechanisms can both contribute to muscle fatigue. However, whether the source of fatigue in individuals with
KOA is central or peripheral is unclear which may be due to maladaptive neuroplastic changes that occur with
KOA. To assess and compare the mechanisms for loss of force with a prolonged walk in individuals with KOA
we will use transcranial magnetic stimulation to measure motor cortex excitability and inhibition (Aim 3). To
test these hypotheses, data will be gathered on 2 groups of 10 men and 10 women: KOA (65-80 years) and
older healthy controls (70-80 years). Both groups will be relatively sedentary, which will be verified
quantitatively using accelerometry. In this cross-sectional study design, we will implement our new
physiologically and clinically relevant 30-minute treadmill walk to induce knee extensor muscle fatigue and
then quantify the response with measures of gait mechanics, electromyography, physical performance, and
motor cortex excitability. The problem to be addressed, muscle fatigue in KOA, and its impact on mobility is
significant and currently prevents many older adults from achieving an optimal health span. Understanding
the mechanisms underlying changes in physical function, such as muscle fatigue in individuals with KOA will
allow for a better understanding of how to optimize interventions in this population. The completion of the
project and the proposed training plan activities including skill development in new experimental and
advanced computational approaches as well as professional development activities will have a significant,
positive impact on the development of the PI as an independent researcher, contributing to the stated goals
of the NIH to enhance training of a diverse work force."
10932141,"Principal Investigator: FM Fernández – Triboelectric Ambient Mass Spectrometry Imaging of Renal Cell Carcinomas
 Understanding complex chemical and biological alterations in cancer requires detailed
knowledge of the molecular composition of cancer tissues and the changes in these alterations over
time, and following interventions. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is the tool of choice for probing thin
tissue sections when femto- to attomole sensitivity is required with simultaneous exquisite specificity.
In this project it is proposed to develop a proof-of-concept MSI ion source based on a triboelectric
nanogenerator (TENG), and benchmark it’s performance against standard MSI techniques such as
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and desorption electrospray ionization (DESI)
using de-identified clear cell renal carcinoma tissue sections. These are lipid-rich cancer tumors where
lipid metabolism plays a major role in disease development. TENG, when coupled to MS, have shown
higher sensitivity than standard nanoelectrospray ionization, particularly for difficult to ionize, low
polarity lipids and metabolites. TENG can also be used to yield structural information about important
molecules such as lipids, by enlarging the TENG electrode area, which allows to carry out controlled
gas-phase ion molecule reactions that yield diagnostic fragmentation patterns. Tissue sections to be
examined by TENG MSI will be selected from the biobank maintained by Prof. John Petros, a long-
standing collaborator at Emory University. The TENG MSI ion source will be coupled to an ion mobility-
mass spectrometer to enable distinguishing lipid isobars during imaging experiments, in collaboration
with the instrument vendor (Waters). Co-registration of TENG images with MALDI and DESI images
will be conducted with algorithms developed with collaborators at Georgia Tech (Kemp). Improvements
to the TENG MSI ion source will be achieved using a symbolic regression approach that will enable the
simultaneous optimization of several quantitative performance metrics such as spatial resolution,
overall sensitivity, the number of detected spectral features, the number of lipid/metabolite chemical
classes detected, and the number of oxidized lipids. Overall, this project will develop an MSI technology
that will become an invaluable tool for investigating lipid-rich tissues of importance in cancer research."

Cancer is the first or second leading cause of premature death in 134 of 183 countries, and it is estimated that global
incidence of cancer will increase by 50% from 2018 to 2040. The number of cases is projected to double in countries with
low Human Development Index; these countries have the least resources and infrastructure to adequately care for cancer
patients. Disparities exist within countries; in the US, racial and ethnic minorities and other medically underserved
populations share a disproportionate burden for many types of cancer. Most cancers can be cured if detected early and
treated effectively. To reduce premature death, the World Health Organization recommends implementing early cancer
detection and prevention programs at the primary care level. Yet, existing tests for early cancer detection are too complex
and/or expensive to implement in primary care settings, particularly in medically underserved areas. We will establish the
Center for Innovation and Translation of Point-of-Care Technologies for Equitable Cancer Care (CITEC) to identify high-
priority clinical needs for POC cancer technologies; to accelerate development of effective, affordable technologies to
meet these needs; to evaluate and improve the clinical and public health impact of POC technologies in diverse settings;
and to train developers and users to create and disseminate more equitable POC technologies. CITEC will prioritize
development of POC tests to detect cancers that arise in epithelial surfaces. Initially, we will focus on sites accessible for
early detection because this is where POC technologies can have the most immediate impact. Targeted organ sites include
the uterine cervix, gastro-intestinal tract (esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, anus), and oral cavity; cancers in these sites
account for 26% of global cases and 29% of global cancer deaths. CITEC builds on the highly productive 15-year
collaboration between Rice University, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine,
and The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston to develop and translate novel POC technologies to improve
cancer care in both low- and high-resource settings. Joining with collaborators in Brazil at The University of Sao Paulo and
Barretos Cancer Hospital and partners in Mozambique at The Universidade Eduardo Mondlane and Ministry of Health, we
will create a collaborative center to support technology development and engage and support a global community of
investigators dedicated to creating and scaling POC technologies for equitable cancer screening and diagnosis to facilitate
early treatment. CITEC will support development of POC technologies to promote high priority topics of NIH cancer
research, including precision approaches to prevention, screening and early detection, reducing disparities in cancer
outcomes, and building a diverse workforce able to translate POC technologies from research and development to
equitable implementation. CITEC will have a major impact on equitable prevention, diagnosis and early treatment of
cancer in the US and worldwide, and will work with the POCTRN network to build a strong team of global partners to
strengthen and sustain POC technology development."

Oncogenic viruses are major contributors to approximately 20% of human cancers, with about 8 well-known
viruses directly shown to be causative agents. Our program will focus on examining cellular processes that are
usurped by these viral agents to drive the oncogenic phenotype. The transcription and replication of oncogenic
viruses in the hypoxic microenvironment has not been extensively explored and here we will explore the
mechanisms controlled by Merkel Cell Polyoma Virus (MCPyV), Epstein Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi’s
Sarcoma Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV). MCPyV is the causative agent of Merkel cell carcinomas, EBV is
the causative agent linked to Nasopharyngeal carcinomas, Burkitt’s lymphomas, Hodgkin’s lymphomas, non-
Hodgkin’s lymphomas, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease in HIV patients that are
immunocompromised, and KSHV is the causative agent for Kaposi’s sarcoma and pleural effusion lymphomas
and is also associated with Multi-centric Castleman’s disease. These viral agents have been the focus of
decades of studies but their function has not been examined extensively in hypoxia. The focus of this
application is to bring together four prominent groups, led by investigators within the University of Pennsylvania
community to join their scientific expertise to address the mechanism of viral-mediated oncogenesis. The
overall goal will investigate the mechanism of transcription and replication control by viral-encoded antigens
and the metabolic changes that are required for their function in hypoxia. These fundamental cellular
processes targeted in hypoxia will provide novel information for successful establishment of viral infection in
hypoxia.
The program consists of four scientific projects, an administrative core, a virus, vector and cell culture core and
a next generation sequencing core. The scientific projects are: 1. KSHV reprograms transcription and
replication in hypoxia; 2. KSHV induces tumorigenesis by harnessing differentiation in hypoxia; 3. Skin
hypoxia, MCPyV infection and MCC tumorigenesis; and 4. Regulation of EBV latency and oncogenesis by
oxygen metabolism.
The success of these projects will establish a comprehensive mechanistic view of oncogenic viral infection and
pathogenesis in hypoxia, and provide new clues for the development of strategies to prevent and treat the
associated cancers in HIV patients. In addition, the accumulation of new information on the biology of these
viruses will be critical for insights into their mechanism of oncogenesis and so reduce the burden of disease in
HIV infected, transplants and other immunocompromised patients."

Abstract
KSHV-associated cancers occur in hypoxic microenvironments. The effects of hypoxia on viral and host DNA
replication in the context of KSHV infection are poorly understood. We have previously investigated the replication
of KSHV in normoxia cell culture systems. We now propose an in-depth analysis of KSHV and infected host cell
replication in the hypoxic environment. KSHV, like many members of the herpesvirus family undergoes both a
latent and a lytic replication cycle. In cell culture systems, latency is maintained through synchronization of the
viral genome replication with that of the host cell replication, which is cell cycle dependent. Therefore, most of the
latent replication activities utilize the host machinery once per cell cycle. These latently infected cells are typically
induced to lytic replication through treatment with chemical inducers and requires the expression of a number of
viral encoded genes. However, little is known regarding replication of the virus genome in hypoxia, and the viral
antigens needed to regulate the ongoing metabolic changes required for persistence of the viral genome through
replication in infected cells that allow for propagation into new daughter cells. We will approach these questions
through a number of aims geared towards understanding the changes in the cellular and viral replication proteins
that occur in hypoxia compared to that seen in normoxia. We will examine the changes in cellular replication
proteins at different phases of the cell cycle, and their post-translational modification. Their levels in hypoxia will
be analyzed to determine the changes in the essential components of the replication machinery. In addition, we
will look at their transcription to determine if these changes are due to changes in the overall transcription of the
genes or if the changes are due to transcription modulation by HIF1α in hypoxia. The changes in metabolic
enzymes that are induced in KSHV infected cells compared to KSHV negative cells in hypoxia will also be analyzed
to determine if the changes are transcriptionally reprogrammed. We will determine the metabolic genes that are
dysregulated on KSHV infection in hypoxia and if the replication genes are regulated by HIF1α, the master
transcription regulator in hypoxia. We will determine the epigenetic changes that occur during hypoxia that will
determine the expression of the replication genes. We will also perform these assays in 3D culture systems to
mimic the associated pathologies. We will also generate shRNA knockdown or CRISPR knockout of selected
replication genes, and Tet-regulated genes to determine the contribution of these proteins in KSHV replication in
the hypoxic microenvironment.

Hypoxia is a characteristic feature of solid tumors and an adverse prognostic factor owing to its contributions to
tumor progression and resistance to therapy. Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) preferentially develops in the lower
extremities of the body, where blood vessels are often poorly oxygenated, suggesting that hypoxia also plays
roles in KS development. Indeed, KSHV infection of endothelial cells or mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
activates hypoxia-induced factor (HIF), a master regulator of both developmental and pathological
angiogenesis. In turn, hypoxia and HIFs affect KSHV biology and KS development. However, given the highly
vascular phenotype of KS tumor, we wonder that the hypoxia response may not be the consequence of
hypoxia condition, but a strategy that KSHV adapts to promote MSC differentiation towards KS phenotypes.
KS lesions are characterized by proliferating KSHV-infected spindle cells, intensive angiogenesis and
infiltrating inflammatory cells. The origin of KS spindle cells remains contentious. Recently we found a series of
evidence suggesting that KS derives from oral mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) through a mesenchymal-to-
endothelial transition (MEndT) process (Li et al., 2018). These findings revealed novel viral tumorigenesis that
cancer can arise from pluripotential stem cells when an oncogenic virus hijacks their differentiation process.
Inspired by the exciting discovery, we attempt to elucidate the mechanism underlying KSHV-driven MEndT and
tumorigenesis. Our preliminary study showed that the transcriptomes of KSHV infected MSCs and KS lesions
largely overlap with that of hypoxia cultured MSCs, raising a possibility that KSHV infection harnesses hypoxia
response to promote MSC differentiation leading to KS. We will investigate this hypothesis with three specific
aims as follows. (i) We will determine how KSHV promotes MSC differentiation through the hijacking hypoxia
response system. (ii) We will identify signaling pathways altered by KSHV and hypoxia and investigate their
contribution to MEndT, angiogenesis and inflammation, therefore elucidating the mechanism underlying KSHV
and hypoxia-mediated MEndT. (iii) We will characterize epigenetic regulation in MSCs during MEndT, and
reveal how KSHV alters the regulation leading to KS. Through these studies, we will ultimately address the
question of how KSHV transforms MSC to KS tumor.
Our proposed studies are highly innovative and of biological significance. First, the study will prove a
paradigm-shifting concept on the nature and cellular origin of Kaposi's sarcoma that KS spindle cells derive
from KSHV-infected mesenchymal stem cells. Second, the study will reveal a novel mechanism underlying the
emergence of KS tumor cells through KSHV-driven MEndT and new insights into the multifocal and oligoclonal

transformation to KS and validate hypoxia as an effective therapeutic target for the treatment of KS."
10914922,"Project Abstract
Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is one of the most aggressive skin cancers. Clonal integration of Merkel cell
polyomavirus (MCPyV) genome into the host DNA has been observed in ~80% of MCCs, and represents a key
causal factor for MCC development. LT and sT encoded by MCPyV genome have been shown to support not
only viral replication but also MCPyV-induced tumorigenesis. Immune suppression is another important risk
factor for the development of MCPyV-associated MCC. MCC has a nearly 50% mortality rate. The incidence of
MCC has increased by >95% in the US since 2000. MCC is highly prone to metastasis. The metastatic
cancers are more difficult to treat and can often be fatal. Thus, there is a need to better understand the
oncogenic mechanisms of MCPyV and MCC in order to develop new strategies to prevent and treat this highly
lethal skin cancer. MCC tumors are usually detected in the human dermis, which maintain a hypoxic
microenvironment. Hypoxia supports tumor progression partly by driving metabolic adaptation, angiogenesis
and metastasis, through upregulation of hypoxia-regulated genes. Importantly, we found that a large number of
hypoxia genes are highly induced in MCC, suggesting that the hypoxic skin microenvironment represents an
important starting point for MCC progression and metastatic spread. Some of these genes such as carbonic
anhydrase 9 (CA9) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) are critical for promoting tumor growth
and metastasis. However, how MCPyV infected cells and MCC tumor cells respond to hypoxia and the impact
of hypoxia-regulated gene expression on MCPyV infection and MCC tumorigenesis remain largely unknown.
We showed that MCPyV oncogene LT is associated with epigenetic reader BRD4, which functionally interacts
with HIF-1α, a key regulator of hypoxic responses, to control the transcription of hypoxic genes such as CA9
and VEGF-A. We also found that MCPyV sT can induce hypoxic gene expression. Building on these findings,
we hypothesize that collaborative interactions between MCPyV LT and sT with their host partners, such as
BRD4 and HIF-1α, collectively regulate hypoxia gene expression in MCPyV-infected and MCC origin cells to
promote viral infection and MCC tumorigenesis. In this project, we propose to determine how MCPyV interacts
with the host cells in the hypoxic skin environment (Aim 1), characterize the impact of LT-BRD4-HIF-1α
interaction on hypoxic gene expression in skin cells (Aim 2), and investigate the function of MCPyV oncogenes
in controlling MCC hypoxic reprograming and the impact on MCC tumorigenesis (Aim 3). These results will fill
the gap in our understanding of hypoxic response mechanism in MCPyV-infected cells and associated MCC.
Our study may provide new insights into viral and cellular factors that support hypoxia-mediated metabolic
reprogramming during MCPyV infection and MCC oncogenic development, revealing new strategies to
improve therapeutic intervention of MCPyV-induced cancers."
10914924,"Abstract:
Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) a human gammaherpesvirus that is associated with diverse lymphoid and epithelial
malignancies. Like all cancers, EBV-associated cancers must compete and survive in nutrient depleted
environments. Adaptation to oxygen fluctuation is a hallmark of most cancers. In this proposal, we investigate
how oxygen metabolism plays a central role in EBV latency and tumorigenesis. For aim 1, we will investigate
how EBV modulates the host hypoxic response during primary infection. Our preliminary data indicates EBNA1
and EBNA2 can bind and regulate cellular genes controlling the hypoxic response, including hypoxia inducible
factor 1 alpha (HIF1A). We will test the hypothesis that EBV infection modulates the host response to hypoxia
to promote infected cell survival and promote tumorigenesis. For aim 2, we will investigate how the viral
epigenome is regulated by oxygen sensing enzymes. EBV associated Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and epithelial
malignancies are known to acquire high DNA methylation commonly referred to as the CpG island methylator
phenotype (CIMP). We will investigate how DNA methylation is regulated through the oxygen-sensitive control
of TET2 enzymes and explore how hypoxia contributes to CIMP and silencing of tumor suppressor genes. For
aim 3, we will test how oxygen sensing enzymes regulate EBNA1 and EBV episome maintenance during latency.
We have found that proline and lysine hydroxylases regulate EBNA1 and EBNA2 protein stability and function.
We have mapped interaction sites on EBNA1 that bind the lysine hydroxylase PLOD1 and found this interaction
essential for EBNA1 protein stability under normoxia. We now propose to investigate how hypoxia regulates the
interaction of PLOD1 with EBNA1 to control EBV episome maintenance and persistence during latent infection.
These aims are highly integrated with other members of the program project exploring hypoxia effects on related
tumor viruses. Together, these aims will provide a framework to understand how viruses respond to hypoxia to
promote host cell survival and drive the oncogenic process."

10913568,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Indigenous Peoples have the highest rate of prescription opioid misuse of any sociodemographic group in the
United States (US). Increasing rates of opioid misuse have led to increased prevalence of injection drug use
(IDU) and concomitant overdose and infectious disease morbidity and mortality. Infectious disease inequities are
driven in part by inadequate access to sterile injection equipment. IDU-associated harms are one of many drivers
of Indigenous Peoples having the lowest life expectancy of all racial and ethnic groups. Despite sustained health
inequities among Indigenous Peoples, very few Federally recognized tribes in the US have implemented syringe
services programs (SSPs). This scarcity is driven in part by the fact that SSPs – which reflect harm reduction
and, often, allopathic “western” approaches to health and well-being – must be integrated with traditional
Indigenous approaches for healing. While these three approaches are not incompatible, their integration can be
challenging. Understanding factors that facilitated the successful implementation of Indigenous-centered SSPs
that integrate harm reduction, allopathic “western,” and traditional Indigenous approaches warrants exploration
since these programs are essential for mitigating IDU-associated harms. We will conduct community-based
participatory research with Indigenous communities that successfully implemented SSPs that integrate multiple
approaches to health and well-being. Through this Project, we will identify the roles of cultural factors, community
contexts, and policy during the implementation of SSPs that integrate multiple approaches (i.e., harm reduction,
allopathic “western,” and traditional Indigenous) to health and well-being in three diverse Indigenous
communities through key informant interviews with persons who played a role during implementation (Aim 1).
We will also determine the contexts and mechanisms by which cultural, social, and structural factors affect
attitudes and beliefs about the utilization of SSPs that integrate multiple approaches among Indigenous-SSP
clients and Indigenous non-clients (Aim 2). Finally, we will examine how patterns of knowledge and attitudes
about multiple approaches to health and well-being and SSPs that integrate them are associated with
sociocultural factors (e.g., cultural identification, stigma) through audience segmentation research among
Indigenous-serving members of the public health and healthcare workforce (Aim 3). The results of this Project
will culminate in a robust evidence base for reversing the inertia of the status quo and eliminating substance use
harms in Indigenous communities. This Project is directly aligned with the goals of the NIDA Racial Equity
Initiative given that Indigenous Peoples have persistent health inequities. This Project is highly innovative as it
will be the first in the US to comprehensively examine SSP implementation processes in Indigenous
communities."
10877022,"Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in the US and worldwide. Unilateral stroke of the left-
hemisphere causes reading and language deficits in 21-58% of stroke survivors and these deficits persist
chronically, despite participation in therapy. The majority of the available reading treatments show the clearest
benefits on trained materials. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new treatment strategies that can
generalize outside of the treatment context. Biologically-based interventions can meet this challenge by directly
influencing beneficial post-stroke plasticity. For example, real-time functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Neurofeedback (fMRI NFB) is an innovative approach allowing participants to regulate their own brain activity.
It uses a combination of mental strategies and concurrent brain activity feedback. Studies have shown that
repeated efforts to self-regulate brain activity lead to learning-induced neural changes. Preliminary evidence
also suggests that real-time fMRI NFB can improve post-stroke motor and cognitive function. The main goal of
the present proposal is to build on this success and to advance biologically-inspired interventions for reading.
Strong preliminary data show that reduced recruitment of the intact left-hemisphere reading areas is
associated with suboptimal reading outcomes after stroke. In addition, pilot data suggest that right hand finger
tap imagery can effectively activate the left inferior parietal region thought to support binding of visual
orthographic information with sound representations during reading. Given that difficulty with orthography-
phonology conversion is the most common deficit among left-hemisphere stroke survivors, the current project
proposes to use right hand finger tap imagery in combination with fMRI NFB to help re-instate left inferior
parietal activity during reading. It is hypothesized that efforts to increase reading-related brain activation in the
left-hemisphere will re-engage the impaired reading mechanisms and may alleviate reading deficits. Under this
K01 award, the applicant will develop skills necessary to test this hypothesis, namely in carrying out clinical
trials using fMRI NFB and motor imagery. This project has 3 specific aims. Under Aim 1, the applicant will
become proficient in specific hardware, software, pre- and post-processing requirements of fMRI NFB, gain
NFB research experience, and acquire critical skills in motor imagery and clinical trial design. In Aim 2, the
applicant will apply this training to conduct a clinical trial feasibility study for a combined fMRI NFB and motor
imagery rehabilitation of reading impairments in left-hemisphere stroke. Lastly, under Aim 3, the applicant will
characterize the neural mechanisms of reading in subacute stroke. At the end of this award period, the
applicant will develop a valid and reliable paradigm for a neuroscience-based reading intervention that has the
potential to change how reading deficits are treated. The methods developed here could be extended to other
domains and to other clinical populations to improve cognitive rehabilitation outcomes."
10889949,"Our group is broadly interested in the chemical biology of natural products (NPs). We seek to identify new mo-
lecular structures that are formed by unusual enzymatic transformations. One successful approach was the de-
velopment of an innovative discovery workflow that embraces big data genomics. With the sequencing revolution
picking up pace, we are leveraging this vast resource to bioinformatically identify, classify, and experimentally
characterize carefully selected novel NPs. For this project, we focus on bacterial NPs for several reasons: (i)
Bacteria are the most historically significant source of molecular probes and drug leads. Such compounds re-
vealed fundamentally new biology and also transformed the treatment of many human diseases. (ii) Bacteria
dominate all other forms of life in terms of genetic/taxonomic breadth, chemical/metabolic capabilities, and geo-
graphic/environmental diversity. (iii) Bacteria tend to organize the genes involved in NP biosynthesis into neatly
organized clusters, which facilitates their bioinformatic identification and subsequent experimental characteriza-
tion. This proposal unites big data genomics, synthetic biology, and modern chemical biology to structurally and
functionally characterize novel NPs. Herein we target pathways predicted to showcase the molecular results of
new enzymatic transformations with a strong focus on metagenome-derived pathways, especially from bacteria
that associate with invertebrate animals.
Several readily cultivated bacterial genera have been extensively studied, which established certain taxa as
prolific sources of NPs (e.g. soil-dwelling Streptomyces). However, knowledge is sparse on less cultivable bac-
teria, which represent the overwhelming majority of microbial diversity. Only relatively recently have the requisite
technologies emerged to sequence and assemble metagenomic data into reads of useful length. As part of this
project, we have repurposed RODEO, our open access, user-friendly genome-mining tool to analyze data deriv-
ing from metagenome/microbiome sequencing projects. “MetaRODEO” will be validated through isolation and
characterization of several distinct NP classes. We center our efforts on NPs from symbiotic bacteria of inverte-
brates, given that numerous species have longstanding and intimate partnerships with their lower animal hosts.
Evolutionary forces have undoubtedly shaped the bioactivity, improved the pharmacokinetics, and reduced the
animal toxicity of NPs from bacterial symbionts compared to soil-dwelling counterparts.
This project involves three interconnected but independently achievable specific aims. Aim I focuses on genomic
sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, and isolation/characterization of first-in-class RiPPs from the invertebrate
microbiome. Aim II centers on new RiPPs and other NPs derived from microbiome-derived biosynthetic path-
ways that employ radical SAM enzymes. Aim III expands the environmental origin and chemistry of NPs identi-
fied by our algorithm by targeting polyene macrolides. Each aim will elucidate new NP structures and evaluate
biological activity using a rigorous, multi-tiered strategy."
10911843,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Ionizing radiation (IR), a highly effective cancer therapy, is known to induce cellular senescence, a cell cycle
arrest program triggered by the DNA damage response. Cellular senescence results in upregulation of mRNAs
encoding secreted factors (including inflammatory cytokines and chemokines), a program referred to as the
senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SASP modulates the tumor microenvironment, and
it has pleiotropic immune-modulatory effects. Although IR sensitivity is known to depend upon host immunity,
the contribution of senescence and the resultant SASP is unknown. Our preliminary data suggest that the
SASP contributes to both localized and systemic anti-tumor effects of IR in immunocompetent, but not
immunodeficient, mouse models. Thus, we hypothesize that the anti-tumor effects of IR, both local and
systemic, are mediated in part by the SASP through an immune effector. This project will use a combination of
mouse and human models to test this hypothesis and to define the mechanisms through which the radiation-
induced SASP alters both local and distant tumor microenvironments. In addition, it will use patient tumor
samples to establish clinical relevance in patients with rectal cancer treated with radiation therapy or with
radiation combined with immune checkpoint blockade. While this proposal focuses on rectal cancer, it has
broad clinical implications, as radiation therapy is a widely used treatment modality for cancer. Dr. Paul
Romesser has outlined a 5-year career plan that builds upon his clinical training in radiation oncology and on
his research background in cancer biology, radiation biology, genetically engineered mouse models, and
patient-derived models. Dr. Romesser will be mentored by Dr. Scott Lowe, an internationally renowned expert
in senescence, p53 biology, and mouse modeling with a strong track record of training physician-scientists. Dr.
Romesser’s career development plan includes research experience, course work, workshops, and mentoring
from an interdisciplinary advisory committee comprising distinguished basic scientists, physician-scientists, and
radiation oncologists. He will have the support and infrastructure of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, a
center of excellence in basic, translational, and clinical cancer research. Successful completion of the research
project will lead to new approaches for treating patients with radiation therapy and will provide the foundation
for Dr. Romesser to transition to a position as an independent investigator with his own laboratory and R01
funding."

Glioblastomas remain one of the most deadly cancers with no breakthroughs in therapy for the past 20 years.
Xandra Breakefield has made critical discoveries demonstrating that these tumor cells release extracellular
vesicles containing informative nucleic acids and proteins that convert normal brain cells to tumor supportive
cells. Working with a team of seasoned investigators she has continued to make breakthrough advances in the
use of these vesicles as biomarkers, in elucidating the means by which they subjugate microglia and other
cells in their microenvirons, and in exploring how they may be channeled for therapeutic purposes. This team
consisting of Drs. Breakefield, Joseph El Khoury/Suzanne Hickman (microglia experts), Thorsten Mempel (T
lymphocyte expert), Marike Broekman (neurosurgeon) and Casey Maguire (vector expert) will advance these
insights in three interrelated areas: biomarkers, cell-to-cell communication and therapy. Studies are designed
to increase sensitivity and reveal clinical correlates of RNA and protein in extracellular vesicle biomarkers from
serum/plasma with goals of early detection, informing therapeutic decisions and longitudinal evaluation. They
will explore how tumor extracellular vesicles participate in changing the phenotype of microglia, macrophages
and astrocytes in the tumor microenvirons, such that they become a “life support” system for the tumor in
defiance of therapy. These insights will be forged into new therapeutic concepts with a focus on engaging the
innate and adaptive immune systems to arm the brain against the tumor. This will include increasing cross
presentation of extracellular vesicle-derived tumor antigens via microglia to infiltrating T lymphocytes using co-
stimulatory molecules. Microglia associated with the tumor will be endowed with increased capacity to release
anti-microbial peptides, which are also anti-tumorigenic, to reawaken their sense of the presence of the tumor
and to down-regulate program death-ligands that exhaust cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Tumor-associated cells,
including reactive astrocytes, microglia and macrophages will be manipulated using systemically administered
adeno-associated virus and other vectors (which are clinically compatible) carrying transgene cassettes under
promoters that are strongly up-regulated in cells near the tumor, but not in the same cell types in other parts of
the brain. Vesicles produced by these cells will also be used to deliver therapeutic cargo to tumors cells to
provide sustained therapeutic impact. These studies acknowledge the cytoplasmic continuum of cancer among
all the cell types that make up the tumor mass, and strike at this supportive microenvironment which sustains
the tumor. Therapeutic strategies are designed to be combinatorial with standard-of-care without increasing
morbidity for this devastating disease that has defied current therapeutic approaches."

I am the Director of the Analytical Biochemistry Shared Resource of the University of Minnesota's Masonic Cancer Center
(MCC), a National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. The shared resource has emerged as a
leading academic mass spectrometry laboratory, acting as an extension of the MCC's Carcinogenesis and Chemoprevention
Program (CCP), and providing critical analytical services to CCP members who account for a large majority of the analysis
performed in the facility. There are currently 16 NCI-funded projects involving nine CCP members who use the mass
spectrometry facility. The integration of the Analytical Biochemistry Shared Resource and the CCP is such that the mass
spectrometry laboratory staff, through extensive training and consultation with group members and collaboration with
principal investigators, functions as the analytical component of many of the research groups. The scientific goals of the
CCP are to understand the chemical and molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis. The relevance of this knowledge to
public health is through the ability to use it to develop and evaluate practical methods for cancer prevention.
I am an integral part of the CCP through extensive consultation and collaboration with the members regarding their mass
spectrometry-based analyses, as well as by working very closely with their research groups. I have daily interactions with
the investigators and routinely attend laboratory group meetings, contribute to writing manuscripts, and participate in the
CCP Seminar Series and the Translational Biomarkers Working Group. The need for my consultation and collaboration
with members of the CCP regarding advanced analytical measurement, as well as day-to-day training and oversight of
members of their research groups, has been growing steadily with the increasing analytical capabilities of the laboratory
and increasing dependency of the users on mass spectrometric analysis to advance their research. There is an ongoing need
to continue to advance the analytical capabilities of the facility as the field of biomedical mass spectrometry continues to
grow and the research goals of the program members evolve. An external source of financial support would give me the
independence and freedom to focus on collaborative efforts with the NCI-funded members of the CCP to provide them with
the guidance and knowledge to harness the advanced analytical capabilities of the mass spectrometry laboratory."

3 There is growing incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Causes for NDDs include ischemic
4 placental disorders (IPD) with fetal/intra-uterine growth restriction (FGR/IUGR), perinatal asphyxia, and
 5 hypoglycemia. Exploration of connections between aberrant placental health and NDDs has occurred. Besides
 6 the intra-uterine environment (IUE), genetic mutations also contribute to a subset of NDDs, forming an IUE-gene
 7 paradigm. We have focused on the neuronal glucose transporter isoform 3 (GLUT3; gene: glut3). Glut3 gene
 8 mutations are reported with NDDs/cognitive disabilities. Glut3 mutations with exposure to an adverse IUE may
9 portray expansive effects upon NDD endophenotypes. Development of diagnostics and early dietary
10 interventions is much needed. We have shown that IUGR and hypoxia-ischemia perturb developing brain glut3
11 expression perturbing neurobehavior. We also created murine glut3 deletions, that reduced trans-placental
12 glucose transport leading to postnatal NDD (excitatory autism spectrum disorders), where small extracellular
13 vesicles (sEVs) fueling diagnostics, and ketogenic dietary intervention are being explored. We next disengaged
14 placental glut3 gene from neural-specific glut3 mutations towards deciphering independent neural mechanisms
15 behind NDDs. We also created glut3 expressing human brain organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells
16 (iPSCs). Assessing pre-clinical ketogenic dietary effects targeting NDDs, will yield novel results. To achieve this
17 goal, we will test the hypothesis, that IUE and neural glut3 mutations/dependency cause NDDs by
18 perturbing neurodevelopment with a potential for amelioration. The aims are: 1) a. To investigate changes
19 in cell numbers per cell type and cell-specific transcriptomics in cerebral cortices (CC) with neural progenitor
20 cellular (NPC) absence of glut3 by using nestin-driven conditional null postnatal mice. This will be accomplished
21 by 10X genomics single cell (sc) RNA-sequencing and bioinformatic analyses, followed by in-situ hybridization
22 (ISH)/immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of major changes in key transcribed/translated products in specific
23 cell types. b. To assess administration of prenatal versus postnatal ketogenic diet as an early intervention in
24 ameliorating NDD. 2) a. To explore neural processes and cellular profile in CC with or without MoMCR/IUGR in
25 targeted absence or overexpression (OE) of glut3 in excitatory neurons/NPCs using Emx1-driven conditional
26 null and OE mice during the life course from embryonic and postnatal to the adult. This will entail deconvoluting
27 bulk CC RNA-seq with ISH/IHC, with non-invasive detection of perturbed transcriptome/proteins in circulating
28 sEVs. b. To examine the impact on CSF/plasma metabolomics, neuronal function and neurobehavior in the adult
29 offspring. 3) a. To develop cortical organoids from control iPSCs with glut3 OE and/or glut3 deletions, and
30 examine cellular profiles by deconvoluting organoid RNA-seq with scRNA-seq and ISH/IHC. b. To interrogate
31 the effect of hypoxia and hypoglycemia with/without ketones/lactate on iPSCs, NPCs and cortical organoids."
10877726,"Project Summary
The goal of the proposed work is to study the typical development of the critical ability to recognize and navigate the
local visual environment, or ”scene”, which constitutes the bedrock of a healthy, independent, and productive life. A
rich behavioral literature in humans has shown that remarkable spatial and navigational abilities are already develop-
ing within the ﬁrst few years of life. Likewise, extensive neuroimaging work has uncovered a network of brain regions
dedicated to scene perception and navigation in adulthood. However, there is key knowledge gap about how these
regions develop the human brain, particularly during the ﬁrst year of life. Here we propose to study the typical devel-
opment of scene-selective cortex in the awake infant brain using magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and functional
near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Across three aims, we develop and test two competing theoretical frameworks.
One framework suggests that early responses to scenes are driven by low-level visual information inherited from
earlier visual systems, and that higher-level scene responses are built on these foundations via cumulative passive
exposure to visual scenes over time. By contrast, the second framework suggests that early responses to scenes al-
ready reﬂect higher-level information about the navigation-relevant features of scenes, inﬂuenced by connectivity with
regions beyond the visual system, and that representations of the structure of the scene are speciﬁcally enhanced as
infants begin to make independent choices of where to go and how. In Aim 1, we will use fMRI in 2-9 month old infants
to test when responses to scenes depicting navigational affordances ﬁrst emerge in the infant cortex; and whether
connections guiding the development of the network are primarily from earlier visual areas, or also from areas beyond
the visual cortex. In Aim 2, we will use fNIRS and wide-angle immersive displays in 5-11 month old infants to study
whether early-emerging functional responses in this system are driven by low-level features (e.g., peripheral visual
stimulation) only, or also by higher-level information about the functional relevance of scenes (e.g., for navigation).
Finally, in Aim 3, we will quantify infants' ecological passive visual experience with scenes, and how that changes with
motor development, in order to ask whether the onset of independent navigation speciﬁcally shapes the neural devel-
opment of scenes, over and above passive visual experience. The results of this work will yield basic insights into the
typical development of cortical scene processing, and shed light on the fundamental debate in development over the
relative roles of maturation and experience. This work will also inform clinically focused investigations into how the
basic developmental processes studied here go awry in developmental disorders, and hopefully, novel interventions
and rehabilitation strategies for individuals who lose these abilities as a result of stroke or neurodegeneration."

This application is designed to provide me with the mentoring experience, training and access to resources
from expert modeling groups that will allow me to achieve my long-term career goal to become an independent
investigator with expertise in conducting population simulation modeling science for tobacco regulatory policy
based on a systems thinking approach. My planned training and research activities will be guided by my
mentors, Drs. David T Levy and Rafael Meza, well-known experts in the area of tobacco simulation modeling
and regulatory science, and a team of expert collaborators and are intended to: increase my knowledge about
the pathophysiology of pulmonary diseases, epidemiology and association between tobacco and
respiratory diseases (i.e. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease COPD); acquire technical skills for the
development and implementation of simulation modeling for impact analysis of tobacco regulatory
policies; and develop specialized knowledge in the translation of tobacco simulation modeling results to
inform policies. The objective of this research project is to build a COPD natural history model based on
individual smoking (cigarette use) histories, that will be used to predict the long-term population impact of two
FDA tobacco regulatory actions on COPD disease burden. COPD is one of the principal causes of morbidity
and mortality in the US. The majority of the COPD cases could be prevented by reducing cigarette use.
However, it is not yet clear the long-term impact of emergent regulations on recent cigarette use behaviors and
chronic respiratory diseases like COPD. Understanding the long-term health respiratory effects of tobacco
products is one of the FDA-Center for Tobacco Products' (CTP) highest priority. This study will produce
evidence, using a public health standard, about the impact of cigarette-oriented control policies on COPD
trends to inform FDA tobacco regulations. The project has three aims. Aim 1: Determining the impact of
longitudinal changes in smoking behavior on lung function and COPD mortality: a Markov Model
Analysis. Using data from the COPDGene cohort, I will assess how changes in smoking behaviors impact the
lung function decline and mortality of tobacco associated COPD. Aim 2 Develop a COPD Natural History
microsimulation model (COPD-NHM) to estimate the future COPD incidence, prevalence and COPD
associated respiratory and lung cancer deaths dependent on individual smoking histories (baseline scenario).
Aim 3. Predict potential US future trends in COPD under two FDA tobacco regulatory scenarios. The
validated COPD-NHM will be used to estimate the population impact of 1. cigarette pack graphic health
warnings and 2. menthol cigarettes ban on COPD morbidity and mortality. The proposed research will lead to
the submission of an R01 award to expand the COPD-NHM to include other non-cigarette products, and other
relevant behavioral, sociodemographic and biological characteristics to encompass the various ways in which
novel tobacco or ENDS regulatory policies could impact COPD and COPD associated cancer progression."
10900676,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Most, if not all, animals form beneficial symbioses with bacteria and live in contact with these
microbes for the majority of their lives. Understanding the mechanisms by which animals
associate with their symbionts is important to human health as we maintain consortia of
benefical bacteria at multiple body sites such as the gut and skin. While both partners ultimately
benefit from mutualistic interactions, hosts and symbionts both need to maintain mechanisms by
which they can ensure cooperation by their partner, also called “sanctioning”. While sanctioning
of symbionts is a widespread phenomenon, it can be difficult to study due to the large number
and diversity of microbial species present in many interactions and the accessibility of symbiotic
interfaces within the host.
The proposed work will determine the molecular determinants of sanctioning in two different
model systems: The Hawaiian Bobtail Squid Euprymna scolopes and its symbiont Vibrio
fischeri, and the skin microbiome of the newt Taricha granulosa. Both of these associations are
defensive mutualisms where the symbiont provides a product to the host that enables the host
to escape predation. We will leverage the tractability and accessibility of these systems, as well
as techniques that we have already developed, to answer crucial questions pertaining to
sanctioning. First, we will determine how the host detects symbiotic currency, the first step in
some sanctioning efforts, through candidate gene and unbiased approaches. Second, we will
define the mechanisms by which hosts sanction symbionts by determining which cells and
molecules lead to sanctioning and how they influence bacterial symbionts.
Overall, this work will determine the molecular mechanisms that allow animal hosts to ensure
the production of valuable symbiotic currency by their symbionts, filling a major gap in our
understanding of how mutualistic associations are maintained over the life of an animal."

The long-term goal of my research program is to understand neutrophil heterogeneity and functions in diverse
tissues and biomedical contexts. We have combined high-dimensional and single-cell profiling with integrated
bioinformatics approaches to defining context-specific neutrophil landscape. Neutrophils, the most abundant
human immune cell type, play crucial, first-line roles in regulating swift responses against infections and
pathological responses. Emerging evidence has shown that neutrophil response is systematic and context-
specific with distinct phenotypes and functions. Burn injuries are among the most common traumatic injuries
worldwide. In severe cases, patients can die of infection, shock, and/or organ failure, requiring expeditious
clinical responses. Proper wound healing requires a coordinated time-dependent balance of pro- and anti-
inflammatory immune pathways to prevent irreversible systemic damage. Despite being the first to mobilize to
sites of injury, there remains little known about neutrophil heterogeneity, their fates, and which factors control
the plasticity of neutrophils in wound healing. We hypothesize that neutrophils' cellular and molecular landscape
change over time during the wound healing process, and that blood neutrophils could be a marker to predict
complications and outcomes in severe burn injury. To this end, we will focus on two important discoveries in
neutrophil biology over the past decade: (i) neutrophil heterogeneity and adaption to specific tissue environments
revealed by high-dimensional flow cytometry and single-cell transcriptome data and (ii) neutrophil reverse
migration phenotypes, shown in model organisms demonstrating that neutrophils migrate back to the vasculature
in response to inflammation. In this MIRA application, I plan to 1) identify transcriptional and spatial landscapes
of neutrophils and their interactions with other immune cells in human burns using multimodal single-cell profiling
approaches, 2) define reverse migration neutrophil phenotypes in human burns by performing cross-species
single-cell transcriptome analyses of neutrophil heterogeneity in wound healing using clinical samples and pre-
clinical zebrafish burn models, and 3) develop analysis pipelines and methods to predict neutrophil behaviors
defined by imaging using single-cell genomic data in humans and publicly available data from zebrafish and
mouse models. In the next five years, I will establish a research program to study neutrophil heterogeneity and
plasticity in wound healing using multidisciplinary approaches. Our approaches are innovative because we will
employ: (i) state-of-the-art single-cell technologies, (ii) novel integrated bioinformatics method development and
analysis, and (iii) profiling data cross-tissues in humans with in vivo validation models using model organisms.
These studies will generate comprehensive data and provide cellular and molecular landscapes of neutrophil
heterogeneity to the community studying wound repair and neutrophil biology."
10932128,"Development of blood-based methylation biomarkers for CRC risk prediction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality rates are disproportionately higher in African Americans (AA)
compared to Caucasian Americans (CA). Current non-invasive screening tools like fecal occult blood test
(FOBT) or Cologuard detect cancer after it occurs, and more effective tools for prevention and treatment of
higher risk individuals, such as colonoscopy or endoscopy, are invasive, less popular and subjective.
Therefore, identification of early biomarkers that distinguish normal colon mucosa of cancer patients from
normal colon mucosa of patients without cancer might decrease racial disparities in CRC. We have identified a
subgroup of patients as having “Outlier Methylation Phenotype” (OMP) using normal tissue methylome. OMPs
are highly epigenetically disrupted and display abnormal DNA methylation patterns throughout their
epigenome. We have been able to significantly associate this phenotype with CRC patients over healthy
controls. Furthermore, AA CRC patients appear more than twice as likely to have OMP than CA. In our current
grant application, we propose to develop OMP as a less- invasive CRC screening and prognostic tool by
evaluating the consistency of OMP status in a less-invasive (whole blood) tissue with an invasive tissue
(normal colorectal mucosa). In Specific Aim 1A, we will test whether OMPs identified in colorectal tissues can
also be identified in whole blood samples in 200 CRC patients (100 AA, 100CA) and age, sex, racial ancestry
and location (for colorectal tissues) matched 400 healthy controls (200 with history of adenomas and 200
without history of adenomas) using epigenome-wide data from >850K CpGs. In Specific Aim 1B, we will
analyze the association of OMP in CRC patients with known CRC molecular subtypes or mutations like CpG
island methylation phenotype (CIMP), KRAS, BRAF, MLH1 to estimate whether or not OMP is a surrogate
marker of any known CRC molecular subtype. In Specific Aim 1C, we will follow-up the controls (especially
OMPs) after 3-4years of screening colonoscopy and compare the clinical outcomes to evaluate the relevance
of this phenotype in screening or CRC prevention. We will also study the association of genetic (Specific Aim
2) and environmental (Specific Aim 3) factors with OMPs. In Specific Aim 2, we will genotype the blood DNA to
confirm the self-identified racial ancestry of our samples and to study the association of genetic variants with
abnormal methylation in OMPs. In Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the effect of diet and social determinants of
health on OMP. Overall, the proposed study aims to identify and characterize molecular markers (OMP) in a
less- invasive tissue (whole blood) that can be used both as a diagnostic and a prognostic tool, especially in
the underprivileged AA population who have the lowest CRC screening rates, highest CRC incidence and
highest CRC mortality rates."
10923857,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
While improvements in immune therapies have revolutionized treatments in some cancers, pediatric brain tumors
are especially resistant to current immunotherapy treatments, including immune check point inhibitors. This may
be because many pediatric brain tumors have been characterized as “immune cold”, with little to no immune cell
infiltration. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have shown promise against fatal brain tumors such
as diffuse midline glioma (DMG) in early clinical studies. However, in early studies, patients inevitably succumb
to this fatal disease. This raises important questions about mechanisms of CAR T cell resistance and devising
strategies to improve and prolong CAR T cell function. Targeting epigenetic programs has been identified as one
strategy to overcome deficient immune responses in solid tumors through both tumor cell intrinsic and tumor
microenvironment mechanisms. We have shown in DMG that inhibition of DNA methylation activates innate
immune pathways that may stimulate immune cell recruitment and activity (Krug et al., Cancer Cell, 2019). Our
data in CAR T cells deficient for a DNA methyl transferase (DNMT3A) displays reduced exhaustion and
enhanced anti-tumor activity against multiple tumor models, including brain tumors (Prinzing et al., Science
Translational Medicine, 2021). We hypothesize that combinatorial approaches that target distinct DMG and
CAR T cell DNA methylomes represents a rational strategy to enhance CAR T cell therapy. We propose to test
this in two specific aims: AIM1: Determine how tumor DNA demethylation in DMG impacts CAR T cell recruitment
and function. We will test the hypothesis that inhibition of DNA methylation induced endogenous retroviral
activation will enhance CART cell activation and persistence. AIM2: Determine if CAR T cell effector function is
improved by DNA methylation inhibition in DMG. We will test the hypothesis that inhibition of DNA methylation
in CAR T cells is a phenotype that translates to DMG, by preventing T cell exhaustion and improving long-term
effector function."

The long-term goal of the Rochester Bridges to the Doctorate (RB2D) for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Students
program is to increase the number of deaf students who enter PhD programs in biomedical science fields, and
the number of deaf students who successfully earn their PhDs in biomedical sciences. Two institutions with a
track record of commitment to this goal, the University of Rochester (UofR) and Rochester Institute of Technology
(RIT), partnered together for the RB2D program. RIT is a major Master of Science (MS) degree granting
institution and home of the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID), the foremost higher education
institution of deaf students. UofR awards biomedical research PhDs, has a research-intensive academic medical
center, and is home to the National Center for Deaf Health Research (NCDHR), a component of the UofR Clinical
& Translational Science Institute. The two institutions have a successful history of partnering together on training
programs for deaf students in biomedical sciences, including for 10 years on RB2D (R25), on the Rochester
Partnership to Advance Research and Academic Careers of Deaf Scholars that focuses on deaf postdoctoral
scholars, and the new Deaf Hub. This new RB2D will advance deaf biomedical science, advance formal and
informal learning environments for the linguistically and culturally diverse deaf community in Rochester, and
broaden the public’s awareness of what deaf biomedical research scientists can do. Additionally, there will be
an increase in the number of faculty and labs who work effectively with deaf Trainees. These objectives are
based on success rates from the current R25 RB2D program, and because of pervasive small numbers, would
represent significant increases in the population of deaf biomedical scientists. The program will host a total of 5
Trainees each year, with expected appointments of 2 years. To accomplish the objectives and the long-term
goal of RB2D, the program will provide four semesters and one summer of research experiences, typically with
experiences at both RIT and UofR labs, coursework both in Trainees’ degree fields as well as specialized courses
in topics such as scientific writing that have been specifically developed with deaf students in mind. Additionally,
Trainees will participate in curricular activities such as professional development that incorporates strategies to
overcome barriers that deaf students and biomedical scientists encounter, and be integrated into the brand new
Deaf Hub at RIT/NTID to provide a robust network at the intersection of the deaf community and biomedical
research. The program will facilitate the success of deaf scientists, primarily by supporting RB2D Trainees in
preparing for biomedical research PhD programs and biomedical research careers, but also by supporting RB2D
mentors in effectively working with deaf Trainees, which will increase the visibility of deaf scientists at an
institutional level and beyond, and in turn lead more deaf students to enter biomedical science research
programs."
10890047,"Project Summary
 Staphylococcus bacteria are the primary cause of healthcare-associated infections in neonatal intensive
care units and the leading cause of skin and soft tissue infections worldwide. In addition to causing impetigo, the
most common bacterial infection in children, Staphylococcus can result in life-threatening conditions, including
sepsis and Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. However, there are currently no effective vaccines available
for Staphylococcus bacteria, preventing maternal immunization, and the emergence of antibiotic resistance
impedes standard treatments. Consequently, there is a need to understand how the immune system responds
to Staphylococcal infections in early life. While innate immune cells utilize germline-encoded receptors to detect
conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns, adaptive cells recombine receptor genes to generate a
broad range of antigen specificities, which delays the emergence of adaptive immunity. Following development,
adaptive immune cells require antigen-mediated activation within secondary lymphoid organs to express the
chemokine receptors and integrins necessary for tissue homing and produce effector cytokines or antibodies.
Consequently, adaptive immune cells are largely absent from most barrier tissues in early life, which instead
harbor innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and innate-like T cells. Both primarily localize to tissues and rapidly release
cytokines due to their developmental acquisition of effector characteristics. While ILCs lack recombined antigen
receptors, innate-like T cells express semi-invariant T cell receptors that limit their antigenic range analogously
to innate immune receptors. Though these lymphocytes arise prior to the establishment of immunologic memory
and are abundant in early life, their contributions to immunity during this period remain poorly understood. The
primary goal of this proposal is to determine the role of innate and innate-like lymphocytes in early-life immunity,
which will be accomplished by 1) developing early-life murine infection models, 2) establishing the contributions
of murine innate and innate-like lymphocytes in these models, and 3) assessing the in vivo responses of human
innate and innate-like lymphocytes utilizing humanized mice. Combining state-of-the-art approaches from
immunology, genetics, and bioinformatics, this highly innovative project will further our understanding of early-
life immunity and lead to the development of novel therapeutics."
10848494,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cellular energy metabolism is a fundamental process of life that produces biochemical energy in the form of
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to support neuronal activity and brain function. Glucose and oxygen are the
main energy substrates of the brain and are metabolized through glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and
oxidative phosphorylation pathways, constituting a neuroenergetic network that effectively regulates ATP
production and homeostasis. ATP production and homeostasis are affected when brain states change, as
signs of altered cerebral glucose and oxidative metabolism are commonly seen in aging, neurodegenerative
diseases, psychiatric disorders, stroke and cancer. Despite the important roles of brain energy metabolism,
metabolic alteration and reprogramming in health and disease, noninvasive neuroimaging tools capable of
mapping and quantifying key features of neuroenergetic network in the human brain are still lacking.
Over the past two decades, we have developed three ultrahigh-field (UHF) metabolic imaging techniques
based on deuterium-2 (2H), oxygen-17 (17O), and phosphorus-31 (31P) magnetic resonance spectroscopy
(MRSI) imaging capable of noninvasive and quantitative assessment of brain energy metabolism along major
metabolic pathways. However, X-nuclear MRSI-based methods face severe challenges in translational
applications due to low detection sensitivity and metabolite content, and prolonged scanning time.
This project aims to develop and integrate multiple cutting-edge technologies to build next generation high-
resolution, high-performance and translatable neuroimaging tools on an FDA-approved 7 Tesla clinical scanner
for quantitatively imaging key metabolic rates and other essential neurophysiological parameters related to
energy metabolism in healthy and diseased human brains. Three pilot studies are proposed to test and
demonstrate the utility and feasibility of the novel neuro-metabolic imaging tools to quantitatively study
neuroenergetics and metabolic reprogramming in brain activation, aging processes and brain tumors, aiming to
understand their critical roles in brain function and disease. This project leverages the interdisciplinary
expertise of an outstanding team leading in the research field, excellent imaging facilities and resources, and
close collaboration among team members. The advanced neuroimaging tools established by this project is
expected to have significant impact on changing the paradigm of neurometabolic imaging and energy
metabolism research, and enable translational studies of human brain bioenergetics and metabolic
reprogramming under physiopathological conditions."
10929422,"Each year thousands of Medicare beneficiaries routinely receive anti-seizure medication (ASM) for prophylaxis after a traumatic brain injury (TBI). These drugs are potentially life-saving given the severity of seizure sequelae, but also potentially life-threatening because of frequent, serious adverse events, e.g., falls. Older adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) are at higher risk for TBIs and post TBI complications. They are also more vulnerable to ASM adverse effects including cognitive slowing. Despite the known delicate balance between benefit and harm, there are no trial data to guide decisions about prophylaxis after a TBI among older adults, and particularly those with ADRD. The sparse and conflicted existing literature has been limited by the difficulty assessing relevant measures, e.g., TBI severity in large data sets. Medicare claims data offer potential, but lack well-validated definitions for TBI severity or treatment-related adverse effects. We will leverage multiple novel linked data sources: Traditional Medicare claims linked to a TBI registry and Electronic Health Records (EHR) of a large regional health system, and National Medicare linked to the Minimum Dataset (a national registry of post-acute institutionalized Medicare/Medicaid beneficiaries, 2009-2022). First, we will improve classification algorithms for TBI severity for use in common administrative databases. Then, we will assess a critical decision in the setting of moderate to severe TBI, particularly among those with ADRD: stopping prophylaxis within 7 days versus continuing. We will apply multiple state-of-the science analytical tools to address confounding and other challenges. We have three aims: 1) To improve classification algorithms for TBI severity for use in common administrative databases; 2) To examine the impact of the duration of ASM prophylaxis for post-TBI patients on 6-month event rates; and 3) To examine differences in treatment effects with preexisting ADRD status. This comparative effectiveness and safety study could inform future policy and clinical care and improve TBI and ADRD care, e.g., through adjustments in Medicare quality incentives and clinical guidelines. Moreover, these data could help inform patients, families, clinicians, and policy makers about how we can improve care the rapidly expanding population of patients with ADRD."
10893422,"PROJECT SUMMARY: The environment can elicit multiple phenotypes from a single genotype, a phenomenon
referred to as developmental (phenotypic) plasticity. Early-life environmental conditions can have lasting
consequences on adult health, such as fetal exposure to toxic chemicals or malnutrition. However, we can also
use developmental plasticity to our benefit, including learning, adaptive immunity, and the benefits of diet and
exercise. Despite the importance of plasticity for reproductive fitness and health, we still lack a mechanistic
understanding of how it works. My laboratory seeks to address this gap in knowledge by applying biochemical
methods to an organismal model of phenotypic plasticity. Evidence from my work and others points to histone
modifications as key intermediaries between diet and phenotype. The central hypothesis of our laboratory is that
the metabolic substrates of histone modifications are, in effect, the signaling molecules which relay diet to
phenotype. Identifying these pathways is necessary to understand how poor – or overly rich – diets contribute to
disease.
Historically, plasticity has been studied in non-model organisms with limited molecular tools. In contrast,
development in model organisms has traditionally focused on invariant processes in invariant conditions. In my
lab, we use an animal model that is both (1) experimentally tractable and (2) exhibits an extreme form of plasticity,
to reveal the connections between diet and phenotype. Pristionchus pacificus nematodes express one of two
possible mouth forms in adults – omnivore or bacterivore – depending on the dietary conditions they experience
as juveniles. In my postdoc, I developed P. pacificus as a model system to explore the role of chromatin in
plasticity. This work led to the discovery that histone 4 (H4) acetylation controls mouth-form development. The
research in my independent laboratory builds off of this result, and seeks to determine the molecular pathways
from diet to metabolism, and from metabolism to gene expression.
In the first five years, we will investigate the upstream metabolic signals and downstream mechanisms of gene
regulation which determine P. pacificus mouth-form. First, we will determine which metabolic pathways are
affected by diets that induce either morph. Second, we will determine how these pathways feed into histone-
modifications, hormone levels, or both. Third, we will investigate how H4 acetylation induces transcription of
genes that control mouth-form. To address these questions, we combine techniques from chromatin
biochemistry with unbiased genome-wide approaches. Our long-term goal is to apply the insight gained from
these experiments to prevent, or treat, dietary-influenced diseases in humans such as type-II diabetes, obesity,
and heart disease."
10887555,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Kinase inhibitor therapy has made a minimal impact on the clinical treatment of patients with Acute Myeloid
Leukemia (AML). We have shown that inhibition of the epigenetic regulator lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1)
augments the efficacy of kinase inhibition in AML, including drugs targeting FLT3, cKIT and JAK2. This occurs
via the repression of the MYC super enhancer (MYC-SE), leading to a loss of MYC gene expression and
consequently decreased expression of a pro-proliferative gene expression program. However, we lack a
complete mechanistic understating of how kinase plus LSD1 inhibition produces this effect, or whether the drug
combination has important effects that are independent from the MYC-SE. Our long-term objective is to establish
the efficacy of kinase plus LSD1 inhibition in AML, translating this concept into new effective treatment for
patients with AML. The overall objective of this proposal is to: 1) define the mechanistic basis for drug responses
to FLT3 plus LSD1 inhibition in FLT3-mutant AML and 2) evaluate the potential of dual MEK and LSD1 inhibition
in NRAS-mutant AML. Our central hypothesis is that the suppression of MYC-target genes is an essential
mechanism of kinase plus LSD1 inhibition-mediated cell death. In Aim 1, we will investigate three possible
mechanisms for FLT3 plus LSD1 inhibition-induced suppression of MYC target genes: 1) Via inactivation of the
MYC-SE leading to decreased MYC gene expression resulting in a loss of MYC-target gene expression, 2) Via
inhibition of LSD1-dependent activation of MYC-target genes and 3) through inhibition of signaling pathways
down-stream of activated FLT3, resulting in a loss of MYC binding to the promoters of target genes. We will also
perform correlative studies investigating these mechanisms in AML patients enrolled in the FRIDA trial, receiving
FLT3 plus LSD1-inhbitor therapy. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the efficacy and mechanism of action of MEK plus
LSD1 inhibitor therapy in NRAS-mutant AML, using an integrated evaluation of chromatin and signaling pathway
dynamics. We will also employ multiple mouse models of NRAS-mutant AML including a patient-derived
xenograft model. At the completion of these studies, our expected outcomes are to 1) have identified how FLT3
plus LSD1 inhibition drives cell death in FLT3-mutant AML and 2) establish the preclinical efficacy of dual MEK
plus LSD1 inhibition in NRAS-mutant AML. These studies will provide key pre-clinical rationale for expanding
the indications for kinase plus LSD1 inhibitor to a larger proportion of patients with AML."

Although the pitch of missing fundamentals has been studied for more than a century, and psychophysical
tuning curves and gap detection have been used as non-invasive tests for diagnosing auditory disorders, the
cochlear mechanical mechanisms underlying these psychoacoustic phenomena remain unclear. This project
aims to study the cochlear micromechanical mechanisms contributing to the pitch of missing fundamentals,
psychophysical tuning curves, and gap detection by measuring the reticular lamina (RL) vibration from apical
ends of the outer hair cells (OHCs) and the auditory nerve potential in living gerbil cochleae. Our overarching
hypothesis is that the mechanical missing fundamental is generated by OHCs and can be detected at the
cochlear locations tuned to stimulus frequencies. Masker-induced suppression and enhancement and
poststimulation oscillation of the RL vibration contribute to the neural tuning curves and gap detection. This
hypothesis will be tested by conducting the following experiments. Experiment One will measure the cochlea-
generated fundamentals in the RL vibration and auditory nerve potential and observe the effect of a noise
masker on the RL and auditory nerve fundamentals. The unmaskable RL and auditory nerve fundamentals will
indicate that the cochlea can generate the fundamental, and this cochlea-generated fundamental can be
detected at cochlear locations tuned to stimulus frequencies. Experiment Two will measure the RL mechanical
tuning curves, the auditory nerve simultaneous and forward masking tuning curves, and the masker-induced
changes in the RL probe response. The results from this experiment will determine whether the simultaneous
or forward masking tuning curve can accurately reflect the RL mechanical tuning curve and whether the
masker-induced changes in the RL probe response contribute to the cochlear compound action potential
(CAP) tuning curves. Experiment Three will measure the RL poststimulation vibration and compare the
duration of this persistent vibration to the gap detection threshold. The expected result from this experiment will
indicate that the RL poststimulation can excite the inner hair cells and auditory nerve fibers during the gap
period, which affects the auditory nerve response to the stimulus after the gap. Thus, the results from this
study will reveal cochlear micromechanical mechanisms underlying the pitch of missing fundamentals,
psychoacoustic tuning curves, and gap detection. The knowledge gained from this project can benefit patients
by optimizing procedures and improving the interpretation of psychoacoustic tests in clinics."
10892246,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Clearly identified barriers have undermined the promise of immunotherapy for pediatric patients with solid or
brain tumors. Most of these tumors lack genetic mutations that encode immunogenic proteins. Bispecific T cell
engagers (BTEs) have potential to overcome this barrier by connecting cancer cells to endogenous host T
cells, bypassing T cell receptor-MHC I interactions to induce T cell expansion and T cell-mediated cancer cell
death. Additional barriers in solid tumors are addressed in this application. Barrier #1 is the paucity of
endogenous T cells in many pediatric solid and brain tumors. Aim 1 seeks to enhance T cell trafficking into
solid or brain tumors via two complementary strategies that involve self-disassembling polymeric chemokines.
The significance of Aim 1 is that a solution for promoting T cell infiltration into pediatric solid tumors will
enable BTE options for non-resectable or metastatic solid and brain tumors, potentially converting incurable
cancers to curable. Barrier #2, unique to brain tumor patients, is the blood brain barrier, which precludes many
immunotherapeutics from entering the brain. Aim 2 was motivated by the unexpected result in our lab that a
novel BTE that we engineered is driving significantly improved survival in a patient-derived mouse model of
diffuse midline glioma (DMG, aka DIPG) despite a relatively intact blood brain barrier. We seek to understand
why this BTE is able to access the tumor and extend survival. We also seek to further optimize the BTE and
test it in a variety of DMG models. The significance of Aim 2 is that DMG patients have an average life
expectancy of 12 months, and this molecule represents an immunotherapeutic option that does not require
cellular engineering. Barrier #3 immunotherapy is that the CD3-binding components of most BTEs that have
advanced to clinical development bind to CD3 on T cells via high-affinity CD3 binding domains that 1) trigger
excessive cytokine release, which causes life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in some patients,
2) accelerates T cell exhaustion, and 3) drives BTE sequestration in liver and spleen. Aim 3 seeks to discover
novel CD3 binding proteins (e.g., fully human antibodies or single chain binders) that can induce cancer cell
death with fewer liabilities. Such CD3 binders have been discovered by others but are locked in industry with
no access provided to pediatric cancer researchers. The significance of Aim 3 is that our candidates could be
substituted into Pediatric Immunotherapy Network BTEs to increase the likelihood that the resulting molecules
will be safer, more effective (because higher maximally tolerated doses might be expected if CRS risk is
reduced), and more efficiently developed. Several protein therapeutics discovered in our lab are advancing in
clinical development. We are ideally poised to overcome one or more of these barriers to help the community
provide effective “off-the-shelf” immunotherapy for children with immunologically “cold” solid or brain tumors.
While independent, the Aims have potential to work synergistically with each other and with discoveries made
by our colleagues in the Pediatric Immunotherapy Network."
10893471,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Eukaryotes have evolved complex signaling networks that assess internal energy and nutrient stores and
respond to the available nutrients. In humans, inaccurate nutrient sensing can result in type II diabetes and
obesity. Unfortunately, the therapeutic targets available to treat these diseases are limited. Cancer progression
is promoted by changes in metabolism, since rapid growth of tumors is mediated by dysregulation of carbon,
nitrogen, and phosphate utilization. A key knowledge gap is understanding how eukaryotic cells distinguish
between available nutrients and integrate signals from diverse nutrient sensing pathways. Filling this gap may
identify targets for future diabetes, obesity, or cancer therapeutics. Many nutrient sensing pathways used as
therapeutic targets in humans were originally identified in eukaryotic microbes. However, much of this work
focused on the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has a limited nutrient utilization repertoire.
Eukaryotic microbes that utilize a more diverse set of nutrients employ additional mechanisms of nutrient
sensing conserved in humans. To characterize novel conserved nutrient sensing regulatory mechanisms, this
project focuses on defining the nutrient sensing network by investigating genes that integrate signaling
pathways and distinguish between nutrient sources in eukaryotic microbes with unique phenotypic outputs. In
response to available nutrients, the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa exquisitely tailors the regulation of
secreted enzymes with easily measurable activity. The oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides
accumulates lipids when carbon is abundant and nitrogen or phosphate limiting. To investigate how signaling
networks are integrated, this project will use the easily scorable phenotypes of these two atypical model fungi
to focus on two questions: (1) the mechanism by which signals are integrated between nutrient sensing
pathways and the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase pathway, which regulates both nutrient utilization and
stress, to achieve downstream responses specific to differing stimuli; and (2) the genetic mechanisms that
integrate signals from carbon, nitrogen, and phosphate pathways. Many conserved pathways that regulate
nutrient utilization in humans play an important role in fungi, especially when cells must distinguish between
preferred and nonpreferred nutrients. This project will characterize conserved genes, including three highly
conserved kinases, that play a role in distinguishing between available nutrients in eukaryotic microbes. An
innovative aspect of this project is using powerful genomic tools, including high-throughput functional genomics
and multi-omics, in understudied eukaryotic microbe model organisms with substantial nutrient utilization
repertoires. Working in these two distantly related organisms will identify conserved genes that may be
important for nutrient sensing throughout eukaryotic species and serve as novel targets to treat metabolic
diseases in humans. Conversely, regulatory mechanisms specific to one species may serve as therapeutic
targets to mitigate deaths from fungal disease."

Shigella infection is a leading cause of diarrheal illness in young children in resource-limited settings,
and results in tens of thousands of deaths each year. Protection against shigellosis is largely
associated with antibodies targeting O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of
Shigella spp. A vaccine protective against shigella will need to be effective in young children in
resource-limited areas of the world. Young children do not develop high level or durable immune
responses against polysaccharides such as OSP unless they are presented in a T cell dependent
manner. In comparison, young children mount high level and durable immune responses when
polysaccharides are conjugated to carrier protein. Here, we propose an international partnership to
advance a quadrivalent shigella conjugate vaccine (SCV4) targeting Shigella flexneri 2a, 3a, 6 and S.
sonnei. SCV4 will be comprised of OSPs recovered from identified source strains and will be linked
to carrier protein rTTHc using squaric acid chemistry. Our partnership has advanced a cholera
conjugate vaccine using this approach that has undergone product development, stability testing,
toxicologic assessment and preclinical evaluation, and is initiating Phase 1 evaluation in humans in
Q4 ‘22. We thus propose to adapt our already established scalable and manufacturable protocols,
building upon our preliminary data showing that shigella conjugate vaccines using our platform
approach are immunogenic and protective in animal models. We will produce SCV4 (monovalent and
co-formulated), characterize product, and assess immunogenicity and protective efficacy in mice,
guinea pigs and a non-human primate model. Our goal is the development of reproducible, scalable,
manufacturing protocols for production of SCVs and SCV4 to support Technology Transfer to a
future manufacturing partner. Proposed product development will be through a partnership that
includes the Vaccine Process Development Team at the International Vaccine Institute (IVI), South
Korea that has expertise in vaccine product development and a history of successful technology
transfer to vaccine manufacturers in resource-limited areas. The ultimate goal is development of a
SCV that can be incorporated into the Expanded Programme on Immunizations (EPI) for use in 12-
24 month old children in LMIC settings with high shigella burden."

Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) accounts for over 50% of all global under-5 deaths. Congenital
anomalies (CAs), notably congenital heart defects (CHD) which constitutes about a third of all
(CAs), are a major contributor to this high under-5 morbidity and mortality in SSA. Late and missed
diagnosis, owing to the lack of experts who can perform an echocardiography scan, remains the
primary challenge to CHD diagnosis and care in SSA. Recently, there have been increased
uptake CHD screening in newborns by pulse oximetry. However, the test is nonspecific and still
requires expert confirmation through echocardiography. The few expert paediatric cardiologist
centres that exist are often located hundreds of kilometers away from the birthing centres, placing
enormous financial and physical burden on parents who must undertake this journey to confirm
their baby’s diagnosis, and not leaving out the particularly fragile and vulnerable neonate who
may end up dying in the course of the journey. Training programs have been demonstrated to
improving image capture and recognition of the anomaly. However, such programs are labor and
time intensive and need to be repeated with staff turnover. A complementary strategy is therefore
needed to improve and sustain the gains from training. In line with the DSI-Africa’s mission to
address critical health gaps through the application of data science, our proposed project seeks
to leverage modern advances in data science and artificial intelligence (AI) to address the problem
of CHD diagnosis in SSA by creating the possibility for low skilled sonographers to conduct an
echocardiography scan for neonates (0-28 days) and extract optimal images that can be
subsequently transmitted to a remote expert for interpretation. This means local non-experts (e.g
GPs, nurses, midwives) serving the birthing centres will now be able conduct postnatal
echocardiography scans for neonates suspected of having a CHD after pulse oximetry screening,
allowing them to obtain optimal labeled images/video clips that can be transmitted to a remote
expert for diagnosis confirmation. This will remove the burden and risk of travelling hundreds of
kilometers, increase early diagnosis and initiation of care remotely, and reduce the workload on
the few available experts. Future steps will include extending to prenatal diagnosis and predicting
actual diagnosis."

Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is the leading cause of secondary nosocomial bloodstream
infections. Urease-producing organisms such as Proteus mirabilis are common causes of CAUTI and
associated with numerous complications. Urease hydrolyzes urea to ammonia, which raises the urine pH and
causes precipitation of ions into crystals, ultimately leading to catheter encrustation and blockage and urinary
stone formation and increasing the risk of bacteremia, sepsis and death. The only urease inhibitor approved by
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), acetohydroxamic acid (AHA), shows efficacy in preventing urinary
stone formation but has severe side effects that limit its clinical use. Therefore, alternative strategies are
needed for targeting bacterial urease activity to prevent catheter encrustation and stone formation. In patients
with long-term indwelling catheters, CAUTI is often polymicrobial. As demonstrated in our prior publications
and preliminary data, we found that common constituents of polymicrobial CAUTI secrete molecules that
modulate P. mirabilis urease activity and infection severity. We therefore performed untargeted global
metabolomics analysis on cell-free supernatants of urease-modulating bacterial strains and identified 36
candidate urease dampening metabolites. We validated the activity of four compounds: histamine (CAS 51-45-
6), leucylglycine (CAS 686-50-0), phenylpyruvate (CAS 156-06-9) and imidazole lactate (CAS 14403-45-3).
Our preliminary data suggests that leucylglycine and imidazole lactate dampen urease activity, at least in part,
by acting directly on the urease active site. In contrast, histamine and phenylpyruvate appear to indirectly
inhibit urease activity through an uncharacterized mechanism. The goal of this NRSA F30 proposal is to
determine the mechanism of action of urease modulation and conduct pre-clinical assessment of the
therapeutic potential of these dampening compounds. Aim 1 will determine the mechanism of indirect urease
modulation for histamine and phenylpyruvate and explore whether compounds of different mechanisms of
action have synergistic effects on urease activity when administered in combination against a panel of urease-
producing pathogens. Aim 2 will assess the translational potential of dampening compounds for preventing
Foley catheter encrustation, crystalline biofilm formation, and blockage. The experiments outlined in this
proposal will provide a framework for harnessing polymicrobial interactions for drug discovery and the
development of novel therapeutics to prevent CAUTI associated morbidity and mortality. This work will take
place at the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences in the laboratory of Dr. Chelsie Armbruster,
who is an expert in CAUTI and microbial pathogenesis research. The training plan is tailored for my
development as a physician-scientist in the field of infectious disease, and includes mentoring by successful
physician-scientists and clinical preceptorships in infectious disease and internal medicine."

Epilepsy is a debilitating neurological disorder that affects 1% of the population worldwide and temporal lobe
epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form. Seizure onset in TLE is typically localized to the mesial temporal lobe,
however, patients can suffer from distant effects such as loss of consciousness during seizures (ictally) and
neurocognitive deficits between seizures (interictally), both of which impair one’s activities of daily living, ability
to work, and quality of life. Prior work investigating these global effects have resulted in the Network Inhibition
Hypothesis, which states that focal seizure activity observed with stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG)
spreads to subcortical structures responsible for neocortical activation, resulting in ictal loss of consciousness in
focal impaired awareness seizures (FIAS). Studies with functional MRI (fMRI) have provided evidence that the
same anatomical areas have abnormal functional connectivity (FC). It thought that recurrent FIAS lead to chronic
interictal decreases in subcortical to neocortical FC, but this knowledge gap but this knowledge gap has not been
addressed. We aim to relate FC of ictal and interictal states using SEEG (Aim 1). I specifically hypothesize during
FIAS ictal FC will decrease in the same anatomical regions as those implicated in interictal FC abnormalities. In
addition to recurrent seizures, patients can also have devastating interictal neurocognitive deficits. These
widespread neurocognitive deficits suggest that there is a common factor, which is thought to be the subcortical
arousal structures. It has been shown that fMRI FC abnormalities of subcortical to neocortical structures are
associated with neurocognitive deficits, seizure frequency, and can recover after surgery. While general
subcortical to neocortical abnormalities have been outlined, there is a gap in understanding of specific brain
networks associated with neurocognitive deficits. This could be due in part to not adequately controlling for
arousal state. The high vigilance or “sustained attention” state, is a state of cognitive engagement mediated by
subcortical arousal structures which fluctuates at rest. It is associated with subcortical to neocortical FC changes,
associated with extratemporal neurocognitive deficits, the state active during neurocognitive testing, and thought
to be a confounder for resting-state fMRI by some. We aim to link specific subcortical to neocortical network
abnormalities with neurocognitive deficits by controlling for the high vigilance state with fMRI-EEG (Aim 2). I
specifically hypothesize that during high vigilance states, patients will have significantly decreased FC within
subcortical to neocortical networks compared to controls, that the decrease will be associated with extratemporal
neurocognitive deficits, and that the network will recover after successful surgery. This proposed fellowship will
provide research training in a collaborative research atmosphere with expert mentors. Research training will be
conducted in an environment that combines an academic medical center with a level 4 epilepsy center, world
class imaging institute, and engineering all on one campus. Studying multiple modalities to characterize epileptic
networks may lead to improved neuromodulation targets for TLE."

Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) sustain lifelong hematopoiesis through self-renewal and
differentiation into all blood cell types. They form during early embryogenesis through a regulated and conserved
process termed the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT). During the EHT, a subset of endothelial cells
(ECs) adapt a hematopoietic transcriptional program to form the hemogenic endothelium (HE) followed by
morphological changes to make HSPCs. As de novo production of HSPCs occurs solely during early embryonic
development, HSPC formation has profound consequences on all embryonic and adult hematopoiesis. Defects
in EHT regulators are prevalent in hematologic disorders, therefore lessons learned by studying EHT could
inform the pathways driving these diseases. Studying EHT regulation is critical for understanding processes key
to hematopoietic health from embryo to adult life. Though some factors controlling EHT are known, our
knowledge of HE/HSPC regulators remains poorly understood. In prior studies, the Bowman lab determined that
proper pre-mRNA splicing is required for EHT as HEs were largely absent in zebrafish mutants for the
spliceosomal component splicing factor 3b, subunit 1 (sf3b1). These data indicate that splicing is important for
HE formation, but the mechanisms regulating the splicing changes critical for EHT are largely unknown. To
explore this process, I first defined the alternative splicing signature between embryonic zebrafish EC and
HE/HSPC. Cis-acting regulatory elements within pre-mRNA guide splice isoform selection thus, to identify
potential mechanisms controlling alternative splicing during EHT, I surveyed alternative splicing events between
EC and HE/HSPC for differences in splicing regulatory sequence features. Through this preliminary analysis, I
uncovered that the EHT alternative events were enriched for weaker splice sites and shorter intron length
suggesting these features could have a regulatory function in dictating EHT specific-splice isoform choice. In
addition to sequence-driven mechanisms, alternative splicing can be modified by transcriptional checkpoints
such as promoter-proximal pausing. In pilot studies, I showed that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of
promoter-proximal pausing factors can diminish HE/HSPC production. Based on my data and the literature, I will
test the hypothesis that EHT-specific-splice isoform selection is guided by distinct cis-acting-regulatory elements
(aim 1) and regulated by promoter proximal pausing factors (aim 2). These studies of cell-type specific splicing
regulation in a complex, multicellular context will enable understanding of how splicing fine-tunes the EHT fate
decision. Completion of this study will reveal critical regulation for the genesis of HSPC."

Targeting the Intestinal Mucosa and Microbiome to Prevent Neonatal Late-onset Sepsis. Late-onset sepsis
(LOS) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in premature infants and is thought to be caused by the
systemic spread of commensal microbes. Perturbation in the developing intestinal microbiome (dysbiosis) is far
more common in premature infants than in full-term infants and is thought to underlie their heightened
susceptibility to LOS, although the mechanisms that predispose to this are not well understood. We recently
developed a new murine model of neonatal LOS, which has confirmed the long-held clinical suspicion of a direct
link between dysbiosis and LOS. We discovered that, by altering the developing microbiome to prevent dysbiosis,
we were able to prevent LOS. This protection correlated with the abundance of endogenous Ligilactobacillus
(formerly Lactobacuillus) murinus, some isolates of which proved to be effective in preventing LOS when
administered as probiotics. Remarkably, however, even closely-related L. murinus isolates differed considerably
in their probiotic efficacy, as did other strains of Lactobacilli—including a number of strains that are components
of commercial probiotics. Moreover, we have found that probiotic strains of L. murinus that prevented dysbiosis
and LOS altered the oxygen status of the intestinal epithelium, suggesting that these strains may modulate
intestinal redox status to prevent the outgrowth of facultative anaerobes that can respire oxygen or other
respiratory terminal electron acceptors. Although a major mechanism driving dysbiosis in adults is increased
availability of substrates of bacterial respiration that allows facultative anaerobes to outcompete the obligate
anaerobes that predominate in a healthy microbiome, our preliminary studies indicate that mechanisms that
predispose the adult intestine to dysbiosis under conditions of inflammation or infection are at least partially
disparate with those in the immature neonatal intestine. We therefore posit that the neonatal intestine is
susceptible to dysbiosis via mechanisms distinct from those previously characterized in adults, reflecting
developmental immaturity of the intestines and early instability of the developing intestinal microbiome. Here, we
will take a team science approach to elucidate both host and microbial determinants of neonatal dysbiosis that
predispose to LOS, marrying the efforts of two labs with complementary expertise in intestinal biology and
immunity (Weaver), and microbial genetics and bacterial respiration (Gray) with collaborators who are leaders
in microbial genomics (Julie Segre), inflammation-associated gut dysbiosis (Sebastian Winter) and neonatology
(Namasivayan Ambalavanan). Through the identification of mechanisms of dysbiosis unique to the developing
intestines and microbiome we will provide a foundation for more rational design of probiotics and prebiotics for
therapeutic interventions that prevent LOS in premature infants."
10917413,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of this K01 proposal is to provide the candidate with formal training and mentoring in psychiatric
epidemiology, psycho-oncology and implementation science; training needed to pursue an independent career
in implementing interventions to detect and mitigate suicide risks among head and neck (HNC) cancer patients.
Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death, and 1 person dies by suicide every 11 minutes in the US. Among
individuals at higher risk of suicide are chronic disease sufferers, including cancer survivors. The suicide mortality
rate for HNC patients is 63.4 per 100,000 person-years, which is four times more than the general US population.
Clearly, suicide is an important public health crisis in the US and is considered a leading health indicator by the
Healthy People initiative. Screening for suicidal ideation is an evidence-based suicide prevention and mitigation
strategy. Several studies have demonstrated that it is feasible and effective to screen patients for suicidal ideation
and behavior in various clinical settings, including general, non-psychiatric emergency room settings. The Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) has endorsed the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) as the tool
of choice for screening for suicidal ideation and behavior. However, suicide screening interventions among HNC
patients are lacking, in part due to the gaps in our understanding of the multilevel barriers associated with
screening HNC patients for risks of suicide. To address this gap, the candidate will utilize the C-SSRS to
characterize suicide risk among HNC patients, and test effectiveness and potential implementability of the C-
SSRS as a routine suicide screening tool in HNC care. Using informant interviews with key stakeholders,
candidate will identify patient, provider and other barriers that could underlie the suboptimal investigation of
suicidal ideation among HNC patients in Aim 1. In Aim 2, candidate will administer the C-SSRS to a group of
HNC patients, providing insights on suicidal ideation and severity among HNC patients in the US. In addition, a
risk management/triage system will be developed to provide follow-up care when suicide risk is detected. Aim 3
will involve a mixed-method evaluation with a subset of patients who received the C-SSRS from Aim 2 to elicit
feedback on the administration of the C-SSRS, and a debrief with providers to assess future implementability of
the C-SSRS as routine part of HNC care. This research will have scientific impact by enhancing our enhancing
our knowledge of the barriers to screening for suicide in the HNC setting. It will have significant clinical impact
through the novel utilization of the C-SSRS in HNC care. Lessons learned will be adopted for future studies in
HNC and across the cancer continuum. The training objective is to address the candidate’s scientific gaps in
psychiatric epidemiology, psycho-oncology, qualitative/mixed methods research design, and implementation
science. Completion of this proposal and training will position the candidate as a transdisciplinary, independent
investigator in implementing interventions to decrease psychosocial morbidity in the HNC population."

Critical electrogenic proteins responsible for maintaining cardiac excitability and conduction, including
sodium channels (NaV1.5), inward-rectifying potassium channels (Kir2.1), L-type calcium channels
(Cav1.2), sodium-potassium ATPase (NKA), and sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) have been
identified to reside in distinct ion channel ‘pools,’ with localization at the cell-cell junction, the
intercalated disk (ID). These distinct ion channel pools suggest regulation via both ‘global’ and ‘local’
control mechanisms. Within the ID, heterogeneous nanoscale structure results in channels
concentrating around gap junctions and mechanical junctions, forming specialized nanodomains.
ID nanodomains perturbation can induce proarrhythmic conduction defects, and disruption of these
nanodomains has been identified in human arrhythmia patients, suggesting that these sites are key
determinants of conduction. However, ID nanoscale structure and molecular organization and their
implications for functional electrophysiology have yet to be systematically investigated in health or
disease.
In this project, we will undertake the first-ever comprehensive and granular quantification of ID structure
and molecular organization using cutting-edge light and electron microscopy techniques and
computational analysis. Further, we will develop a novel computational modeling framework to
incorporate experimental measurements of these distinct ion channel pools (lateral membrane and ID)
and ID nanoscale structure to assess regulation of tissue-scale cardiac conduction, for direct
comparison with optical mapping of murine myocardium. Simulations will extend predictions to
conduction in human ventricles and predict how both chronic and acute ID perturbations impact
conduction in conjunction with additional functional defects, including non-ischemic heart failure.
Upon successful completion of these aims, we will produce a new theoretical underpinning for which
distinct ion channel pools and intercalated disk nanoscale structure confer a ‘global/local control’ of
cardiac conduction and suggest new therapeutic approaches to preserve conduction during disease
progression."
10769747,"ABSTRACT
The mammalian auditory system has evolved into a biological marvel with high sensitivity that can largely be
traced to nonlinear amplification by the organ of Corti (OoC)—the sensory epithelium within the cochlea of the
inner ear. Despite decades of research, the inaccessibility of the inner ear’s bony capsule and the technological
challenges of measuring and modeling nanometer-scale vibrations in a multi-physics system have made it
difficult to uncover OoC structure-function relationships. However, increased computational capabilities and
novel imaging technologies such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) now make it possible to capture OoC
motion in more detail than ever before, which is revolutionizing our understanding of cochlear amplification. The
most well-understood aspect of amplification is the somatic motility of outer hair cells (OHCs), and recent data
measuring OoC motion across the three rows of OHCs suggests that the reticular lamina (RL) is flexible and not
a stiff plate as was thought for over a century. Our central hypothesis is that RL flexibility sets the phase of OHC
bundle motion and is therefore necessary for cochlear amplification. To test this hypothesis, we will measure
OoC motion from multiple angles from healthy cochleae of living, normal-hearing mice using a high-resolution
OCT system in both the lower-frequency apical region and higher-frequency basal region of mice. We will
measure distinct radial locations along the RL and along the junctions between OHCs and Deiters’ cells
corresponding to the three OHC rows, at multiple frequencies and sound pressure levels. We will also measure
along the basilar membrane (BM) to fully characterize RL motion in relation to the motion of the BM and other
OoC structures. These measurements will test our hypothesis by providing empirical evidence for the degree of
RL flexibility in the radial and transverse directions across different frequencies and levels at two different
cochlear locations. We will also use the measurements to develop detailed, multi-physics, finite-element cochlear
models, which will give us insight into the relationship between the RL and tectorial membrane and the drive to
OHC bundles. Both the apical and basal models will contain key elements of OoC cytoarchitecture including the
interdigitated Y-shape building blocks made from OHCs, Deiters’ cells, and the phalangeal processes of Deiters’
cells, sandwiched between the basilar membrane and the RL mosaic. We aim to produce motion in the models
comparable to post-mortem (passive) and in-vivo (active) OCT measurements and will investigate the effects of
RL stiffness on OHC-bundle phase and cochlear amplification. Completion of these aims will have wide-reaching
implications. Not only will this research uncover fundamental knowledge about the nature of hearing, but it has
the potential to contribute to improved understanding, diagnoses, and treatment of human cochlear pathologies."
10907674,"ZIP8 is a transmembrane importer of divalent metals into the cytosolic space through the cell membrane and from subcellular compartments. Although GWAS data implicate hypofunctional ZIP8 mutations in a myriad of serious pathologies, there is a paucity of mechanistic studies investigating its functions during homeostasis or pathologic conditions. We have created two novel ZIP8 knockout (KO) mouse models in order to study this transporter, an inducible whole-body KO and a lung epithelium-specific KO, and our preliminary data indicate significant roles of ZIP8 in lung host immunity, splenic iron recycling, and placental nutrient transport. Specific Aim 1. Define the functions of ZIP8 as a metal transporter in the immune response to lung infections. ZIP8 expression is higher in the lung than in any other organ system, but its biological function is unknown. Our preliminary data show that lung ZIP8 is located primarily in the alveolar epithelium, where it imports iron from the alveolar space, is upregulated with both inflammatory stimuli and gram-negative bacterial infection, and is important for induction of the antioxidant enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We will characterize ZIP8-mediated transport of Fe, Zn, and Mn during both homeostasis and LPS lung injury using radioactive metal tracers, and study the effects of ZIP8 on the outcomes of gram-negative bacterial and fungal lung infections. Specific Aim 2. Define the role of ZIP8 in splenic macrophage erythrophagocytosis and iron recycling. Our preliminary data show that spleen ZIP8 is primarily expressed in macrophages, ZIP8 deletion induces splenic iron sequestration within red pulp macrophages and serum iron restriction, and spleen ZIP8 expression is regulated by splenic iron levels. We will identify the location, activity, and regulation of ZIP8 within splenic macrophages. Using mouse models of altered iron handling with iron overload, iron deficiency, and hemolysis, we will also characterize the function of ZIP8 in iron recycling during both baseline homeostasis and stress. Specific Aim 3. Define the contribution of ZIP8 to maternal-fetal nutrient transport in the placenta. The placenta is the second highest ZIP8-expressing tissue type in humans, and global ZIP8 ablation in mice is embryonic lethal. Our preliminary data show that placental ZIP8 is expressed in syncytiotrophoblasts, indicating a key role of ZIP8 in the transport of nutrient metals from maternal circulation to the embryo. We will use a novel trophoblast specific ZIP8 KO mouse to define the role of ZIP8 in placental transport of Fe, Zn, and Mn, perform confirmatory studies using primary human trophoblasts, and investigate ZIP8 regulation by maternal iron status. Our proposal will answer fundamental questions about the pathophysiologic functions of this critical metal transporter in metal-mediated lung host immunity, splenic iron recycling, and placental transport of nutrient metals. The findings will inform our clinical approaches in diagnosing and managing the many pathologies associated with disrupted metal homeostasis."

10898716,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Each year, hundreds of millions of patients are exposed to general anesthesia for surgery. Millions of
these patients are particularly vulnerable to injury during surgery because they are either very young (e.g.,
neonates and infants) or older (>70 years of age). One critical role of the anesthesiologist is to ensure
hemodynamic stability and adequate organ perfusion (e.g., prevent intraoperative hypotension). When caring for
patients at the extremes of age, this can be challenging because up to 80% of neonates, infants, and older adults
experience intraoperative hypotension. This represents a significant public health problem as intraoperative
hypotension has been shown to cause significant morbidity and mortality in this population and is associated
with millions of dollars in additional healthcare costs per year. Though it is clear that intraoperative
hypotension is a significant problem in neonates, infants, and older adults, the mechanisms that underlie
the increased risk of intraoperative hypotension and its consequences remain unclear.
 To address this, we propose to use complementary in vitro and in vivo approaches to provide new insights
into mechanisms by which patients at extremes of age suffer intraoperative hypotension with increased
frequency. The goal of this research program is to investigate how the unique properties of the vasculature at
the extremes of age contribute to the development of intraoperative hypotension in the setting of commonly used
general anesthetics. Our published and preliminary data show that mesenteric arteries in juvenile rats are stiffer
with diminished capacity to constrict to norepinephrine compared to adults. In contrast, middle cerebral arteries
from juvenile rats demonstrated reduced stiffness and impaired autoregulation of cerebral blood flow when
compared to adults. Taken together, these data provide the foundation upon which we hypothesize that the
underlying mechanism of increased risk of intraoperative hypotension in patients at the extremes of age
is vascular in origin.
 Over the next 5 years, we propose to investigate vascular mechanisms by which patients at the extremes
of age are at increased risk of intraoperative hypotension and resultant organ hypoperfusion when exposed to
general anesthesia. By studying isolated mesenteric and cerebral arteries we will identify biomechanical and
cellular mechanisms that differentiate the very young and older adults from adults of intermediate age.
Separately, we will use in vivo approaches to identify definitions of hypotension that are determined based upon
organ perfusion. Finally, we will determine which anesthetic regimens are least likely to produce hypotension,
and which therapies used to treat hypotension best balance improving blood pressure while preserving whole-
body organ perfusion. These distinct but complementary lines of inquiry will be an important step towards
optimizing perioperative care for those at the extremes of age."

 The objective of the proposed project is to continue the laboratory’s development of a
neuroprosthetic therapy that uses targeted, activity-dependent spinal stimulation to improve arm
and hand motor recovery after cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). The project seeks to advance
clinical practice through the use of brain-computer-interface technology to harness physiological
mechanisms of neural plasticity.
 Motor deficits severely impact the quality of life of people with SCI, yet current treatments
produce limited improvements in movement abilities. Recent clinical and experimental evidence
suggests that electrical stimulation of the nervous system can be an effective therapy for a
variety of neurological disorders. Here we will extend study of a novel application of electrical
stimulation for rehabilitation of forelimb motor deficits in a rat model of cervical SCI. The strategy
is designed to enhance the function of spared neural pathways by directing Hebbian plasticity
through targeted stimulation of volitionally activated neural circuits. Results will lay the
foundation for a future clinical trial using spinal stimulation in human subjects.
 Previous data demonstrated the effectiveness of multi-channel, intraspinal stimulation
triggered by activity of forelimb muscles to improve motor performance in rats with chronic SCI.
Specific Aim 1 seeks to complete the characterization of the interplay between stimulation and
physical rehabilitation in order to establish principles for combining the therapies. Specific Aim 2
will examine possible causes underlying dramatic differences in recovery in female and male
rats treated with the closed-loop stimulation. Specific Aim 3 will determine if activity-dependent
epidural stimulation, a much less invasive and easier to translate to clinical practice approach
than intraspinal stimulation, is as effective in facilitating recovery."

Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide and new treatments are needed. This therapeutic
challenge stems from the fact that depression involves deficits distributed among neuronal subtypes and multiple
brain regions. A growing body of clinical research demonstrates that a single dose of N-methyl-D-aspartate
receptor , induce rapid and durable
improvements in depressive symptoms persisting for days to weeks in patients refractory to conventional
antidepressant therapies. Despite nitrous oxide being the oldest and one of the safest anesthetics in current
 (NMDA-R) antagonists, inhaled nitrous oxide or intravenous ketamine
clinical practice, our understanding of how nitrous oxide modulates neuronal activity and circuit function to
produce its clinical effects is extraordinarily limited. While it has been hypothesized that the therapeutic effect of
NMDA-R antagonists is related to their ability to induce plasticity, the mechanisms that initiate and sustain this
plasticity remain unclear. By combining in vivo imaging of synaptic structure, functional calcium imaging,
electrophysiology, and behavioral recordings, this proposal will test an innovative hypothesis that
changes in neuronal activity imposed by nitrous oxide acutely, automatically give rise to sustained
plasticity through activity-dependent mechanisms. This hypothesis is based on extensive work on activity-
dependent plasticity in the neocortex and on our own novel preliminary results showing that nitrous oxide
specifically and directly activates layer 5 pyramidal neurons, which mediate cortico-cortical and cortico-
subcortical connectivity, through a novel mechanism. All animal models and techniques have been established
in the studies that generated the preliminary results, making the proposal highly achievable. In line with the
mission of the NIGMS, the immediate goal of this proposal is to lay the foundation for advances in the
treatment of depression by understanding the mechanisms of action of nitrous oxide in cortical circuits.
Such an understanding may explain how acute pharmacologic interventions can lead to sustained therapeutic
benefits in the setting of depression and potentially other neuropsychiatric diseases."

 Antibiotic resistance poses an increasingly prevalent public health challenge, but advances in the
development of new drugs has not progressed commensurately. A significant impediment lies in that many
fundamental biochemical processes in bacteria remain poorly understood. The primary goal of the proposed
research is to illuminate how bacteria respond and adapt to changes within their environments from a structural
and mechanistic standpoint. Using the genetically tractable Gram positive organism Bacillus subtilis as our model
system, we will focus our efforts on elucidating the molecular basis for copper-dependent transcriptional
regulation and uncovering the drivers of enzyme specificity during the environmental stress response. Copper is
required for bacterial survival, but excess levels of this transition metal can be toxic. Therefore, copper levels
must be carefully controlled. The mechanisms by which copper export occurs have been extensively studied,
but relatively little is known about copper import. We hypothesize that Cu uptake is regulated by Cu-dependent
transcriptional repressors and the proteins under their control. Here, we will focus on a suite of proteins implicated
in these processes, studying them at a detailed structural, molecular, and cellular level to better understand how
they regulate copper uptake. In parallel, we will investigate what causes a family of very closely related kinases
to specifically regulate distinct functions. Many bacterial species, including Bacillus subtilis and a number of
pathogenic strains, encode one or more kinases that contain a domain termed the Bergerat fold. Despite their
structural commonalities, enzymes with this domain exhibit strong preferences for their physiological binding
partners. However, the molecular basis for how such specificity is conferred has yet to be investigated. We
hypothesize that variations within the Bergerat fold influence substrate specificity and kinetics and can be
targeted by small molecule inhibitors. By integrating tools from structural biology, microbiology, biochemistry,
and computational studies, we will be poised to reveal new paradigms in transcriptional control. The completion
of the proposed studies will catalyze our future investigations into elucidating analogous pathways in pathogenic
strains, uncovering novel members of these families in bacterial phylogeny, and designing small molecule
inhibitors."

The hallmark of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) is their capability to self-renew and differentiate, which is governed
by the core pluripotency circuitry consisting of pluripotency factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG. Enhancers are
fundamental in regulating the spatial and temporal expression of pluripotency genes and lineage specific genes
during cellular differentiation and embryogenesis. Enhancer-regulating epigenetic modifiers play critical roles in
normal physiological processes and human pathogenesis. Epigenetic marks such as H3K4me1 and H3K27ac
are widely believed to regulate the activity and higher-order chromatin structure of enhancers by directly
remodeling local chromatin and/or recruiting reader proteins. However, recent discoveries of catalytic-
independent functions of multiple histone modifiers suggest that these enzymes govern enhancers and stem cell
differentiation via a non-catalytic manner. Despite the importance of epigenetic modifiers in mammalian
development and human diseases, how they sustain stem cell identity and impact human health is poorly
understood. I previously demonstrated that while enhancer activation does not require the catalytic activity of
histone methyltransferase MLL4 in PSCs, it is regulated by the functional antagonism between MLL4 and histone
demethylase LSD1. Using state-of-the-art unbiased approaches, my lab recently unveiled novel mechanisms
underlying the role of enhancer-regulating epigenetic modifiers in PSCs, providing insight into elucidating gene
regulation and cell fate transition. Here, I propose to build two research areas in my laboratory focused on
enhancer-regulating epigenetic modifiers. The first research area will focus on identifying catalytic-independent
functions of LSD1 in governing gene expression and cellular differentiation. The second research area will focus
on determining how MLL4 and its interactors modulate enhancer activity and cell fate transition. I anticipate that
accomplishing the proposed studies will reveal novel mechanisms underlying enhancer regulation, decipher how
stem cell self-renewal and differentiation are governed, and pave the way for understanding the pathogenesis of
diseases driven by enhancer malfunction."

Unifying scientific principles in the life sciences continue to be discovered in viral systems. Gene therapy and
oncolytic virotherapy depend on viral vectors. Awareness that a deep understanding of fundamental virology is
necessary for the development of gene therapy led to the foundation of the Virology and Gene Therapy (VGT)
track of Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (MCGSBS) in 2004; since 2018 the NIH supports
three of its best pre-doctoral students. Ph.D. training leverages the strength of basic research and the robust
translational infrastructure at Mayo Clinic. Training is performed in the laboratories of 22 VGT faculty members.
Eight are from the Department of Molecular Medicine, three from Medical Oncology, two each from Infectious
Diseases, Hematology, and Biochemistry/Molecular Biology. The others are from five different departments. The
faculty is united by leadership in research on viruses, vectors, mechanisms of human disease, cancer treatment,
and gene therapy. VGT popularity is based in part on its unique training opportunities in both virology and the
translation of viral and gene therapeutics. During the entire time of their thesis the students engage in a full array
of programmatic activities including journal clubs, seminar series, an annual retreat and national scientific
meetings. Requirements for the VGT track conform to the general requirements of MCGSBS. Continued NIH
support of three trainees would allow further development of this successful and innovative program."

Nanomedicine is a research field centered around applying materials in the nanoscale size range (i.e.
nanoparticles) as therapeutics and diagnostics. However, a major challenge is the safe, efficient, and effective
delivery of nanoparticles to biological systems, such as cells, tissues, and organs. In this project, we will introduce
and explore a novel framework for nanomedicine development with the ultimate goal of efficiently delivering non-
viral nanoparticles to cells and tissues for safe and effective applications. Our proposed research program has
three main strands: (i) we will develop novel nanoparticles for the safe, efficient, and effective delivery of small
molecules and nucleic acid payloads to skeletal muscle cells; (ii) we will develop novel methods for super-
resolution bioimaging to study the mechanisms and kinetics of nanoparticle spatiotemporal transport in biological
systems; (iii) we will quantify safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of nanoparticle in vivo delivery. Using this novel
framework, our long-term scientific goal is to create a major breakthrough in nanomedicine by developing safer,
more efficient, and more effective nanoparticles for the non-viral delivery of small molecule-based drugs and
nucleic acid payloads to enable therapeutic applications in skeletal muscle disorders."

Structural dispersity in synthetic polymers is paramount for their clinical use and regulatory approval. In this
project, we propose the development of water-soluble discrete bottlebrush polymers bearing alternating
phospholipid and fluorinated comonomers to enable their clinical applications as metal-free19F MRI contrast
agents. The novelty of the proposed polymer system is that it combines: 1. discrete molecular weight (as
opposed to conventional disperse polymers); 2. multifunctionality of branched architectures; 3. high water
solubility and biocompatibility of phosphorylcholine groups; and 4. exogenous and chemically identical signal
of19F groups. Rational design of the brush polymer architecture, comonomer sequence, and
lipophilic-hydrophilic balance is anticipated to suppress signal broadening and yield discrete synthetic
polymer-based platforms that can be further extended to other targeted imaging and sensing strategies."
10929407,"Identifying environmental risk factors for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is critical to mitigate cognitive decline in
humans. We provide first evidence showing that endocrine disrupting bisphenols (BP) are clinically relevant
environmental risk factors for AD. Human exposure to BPA and the bisphenol analogs BPF and BPS is inevitable
due to their ubiquitous presence in the environment. Our data show that BPA triggers blood-brain barrier
dysfunction and cognitive impairment, both hallmarks of AD, indicating that environmental BPs are a critical yet
underrecognized AD risk factor. Key characteristics of BP-induced barrier dysfunction include: 1) loss of the
amyloid-beta (Ab) clearance transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and 2) development of barrier leakage. Both these
factors contribute to a pathological cascade that leads to cognitive decline in AD. While there is evidence that
BP exposure results in a dysfunctional barrier, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is unknown, and key
mechanistic data linking BPs and AD are not available, which hinders our understanding of environmental risk
factors for AD. In this application, we address this critical unmet need and propose to define the relevance of
BPs as risk factors for AD. Our objective in this proposal is to define signaling steps through which BPs induce
barrier dysfunction and contribute to cognitive decline in AD. Based on preliminary data, our central hypothesis
is that BPs induce barrier dysfunction, increase Ab levels, and enhance cognitive decline in an AD model. Our
rationale for this research is that identifying the mechanism through which BPs induce barrier dysfunction and
exacerbate cognitive impairment will provide proof-of-concept that endocrine disruptors are an environmental
risk factor for AD. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Identify the mechanism
responsible for BP-induced barrier dysfunction. 2) Determine BP levels, barrier dysfunction, and cognition in AD
patients compared to CNI. 3) Develop a strategy to repair BP-induced barrier dysfunction and slow cognitive
decline in vivo. In Aim 1, we will identify signaling steps that lead to BP-induced P-gp loss and barrier leakage in
isolated mouse brain capillaries, and we will verify these findings in capillaries from KO mice and in isolated
human brain capillaries. In Aim 2, we will determine BP levels and the degree of barrier dysfunction BP levels in
human tissue samples from cognitive normal individuals, preclinical AD, MCI and AD patients. In Aim 3, we will
block BP signaling to mitigate barrier dysfunction and evaluate the benefit of this strategy on slowing cognitive
decline in vivo in a mouse AD model. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantive
departure from the status quo by shifting to a mechanism-driven approach focused on the impact endocrine
disruptors have on barrier function and cognition in AD. The proposed research is significant because it is
expected to create a paradigm shift in our understanding of the importance of environmental risk factors for AD."
10872274,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT:
The goal of the UCSF Oral and Craniofacial Sciences (OCS) training program is to provide multidisciplinary
education and training to address questions of biological relevance to dental, oral and craniofacial science, and
clinical care. We train a diverse group of students from a broad range of backgrounds. Our program faculty are
well trained in skills related to mentoring and support of diversity, equity and inclusion in all education and
training activities. The trainees supported by this training grant, include those pursuing DDS/PhD, PhD, and
postdoctoral fellowships. PhD program components include rigorous didactic courses and hands-on training
courses; lab rotations in three different labs; oral presentations of scientific information and hypotheses
defense via tutorial training with faculty in a journal club setting; an intensive oral qualifying exam; individual
thesis research and finally; a dissertation seminar. DDS/PhD trainees combine this training with a dental
school education. Postdoctoral fellows focus on identifying and developing their own unique research
directions. Integrated throughout this training program, from the first day to the last, are activities that train and
encourage trainees to :i) develop skills in responsible conduct of research (RCR), rigor & reproducibility and
chemical and biological safety; ii) openly receive and give feedback through evaluation and assessment tools; iii)
foster career interests, including use of Individual Development Plans (IDPs); iv) enhance written and oral
communication skills; (v) celebrate diversity and a sense of community and vi) gain training in critical analysis via
journal clubs, seminars and minicourses. The research in the OCS program is highly inter-disciplinary and includes
research in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, cell and cancer biology, biomaterials and
bioengineering, craniofacial and skeletal biology, microbiome/microbiology, and clinical and translational
research. To enact this training program, the OCS program is not associated with a specific department; rather, we
bring together faculty from throughout UCSF’s world-class research enterprise, currently representing ten different
academic departments in the Schools of Dentistry, Medicine, and Pharmacy. Oversight of the OCS program is
maintained by the OCS Steering Committee, along with an engaged Dean of the UCSF School of Dentistry and
UCSF Graduate School, and an expert external advisory committee. Member faculty are rigorously and holistically
evaluated by the OCS Steering Committee for excellence in research, mentoring and commitment to diversity, and
these faculty are required to complete annual mentor training. Interdisciplinary research training is carried out
within an intellectually integrated and well-equipped collection of member labs, and a uniquely collaborative,
interactive and communicative research environment. Our graduates are highly sought-after in academia,
industry and beyond, because of their training, creativity and passion for inter-disciplinary science."
10886078,"DISENTANGLING SUGAR SIGNALING IN PLANTS
ABSTRACT
Sugars like glucose and fructose power and control the development of all living organisms. In
plants, multiple enzymes involved in sugar metabolism—namely HEXOKINASES (HXKs) and
FRUCTOSE 1-6-BIPHOSPHATASES (FBPs)—also function as sensing and signaling hubs that
regulate gene expression. Three major challenges hinder the understanding of the physiological
role of these enzymes, not only in plants but in multicellular organisms at large. First, mutations
of these enzymes result in pleiotropic effects that complicate the interpretation of organ and
tissue-level phenotypes. Second, because they act jointly in metabolism and signaling, it is difficult
to differentiate the contribution of individual enzymes to the ultimate phenotype. Lastly, methods
to quantitatively monitor the activity of individual enzymes directly, non-destructively, with cellular
resolution, and in planta are lacking. As a result, all direct targets of HXKs and FBPs regulation
and their involvement in plant growth have not been elucidated.
This MIRA project will use protein engineering, chemical screening, and synthetic biology to
generate biomolecular tools that will allow the isolation, manipulation, and monitoring of the
individual metabolic and signaling activities of HXKs and FBPs. The main goal of this project is to
manipulate these enzymes' signaling functions without affecting the cells' metabolism and vice
versa. Furthermore, all synthetic constructs will be deployed in a tissue-specific manner to
differentiate systemic and cell-autonomous effects. The chosen model system will be the primary
root of Arabidopsis thaliana, an organ that is anatomically simple, genetically tractable, chemically
accessible, and amicable to confocal microscopy."
10890742,"There are currently nearly 8,000 clinical trials and observational cohort studies funded by the National Institutes
of Health in the United States, yet less than 10% of these studies are conducted in Institutional Development
Award (IDeA) states that serve underrepresented minority and rural populations. Not surprisingly, only
approximately 7% of expenditures for clinical trials and observational studies go to the 23 IDeA states and Puerto
Rico. Barriers that limit expansion of clinical trial and cohort studies in IDeA states include lack of effective
communication to trial sponsors of the expertise and capability that IDeA institutions possess to effectively
conduct clinical studies, effective communication to IDeA investigators regarding clinical trials opportunities, and
lack of clinical trial coordinators. The overall goal of this project is to increase numbers of clinical trials and
observational cohort studies in IDeA states, thereby increasing trial availability and participation of minority and
rural populations historically underrepresented in clinical trials. We will achieve this goal by establishing the IDeA
State Consortium for Clinical Research Resource Center (ISCORE-RC) comprised of the Clinical Trials Service
Center and the Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) Development Program to address the identified barriers
through accomplishment of the following specific aims. Aim 1 - Effectively communicate and market to
clinical trial sponsors the expertise, quality, and capacity of IDeA state institutions to conduct clinical
trials. We will accomplish this aim through several tactics to include leveraging the TriNetX platform that
connects clinical trial sponsors with institutions serving relevant patient populations to identify sites with
potentially eligible participants for specific clinical trials, creating a repository containing site-specific profiles
showcasing strengths of individual IDeA state trial groups, establishing an ISCORE-RC website that provides a
public resource to demonstrate benefits of partnering with IDeA organizations to increase clinical trial participant
representation from underserved populations, and facilitating networking of sponsors with investigators. Aim 2 -
Communicate to IDeA state investigators clinical trial opportunities. To accomplish this goal, we will
develop site specific search criteria in clinicaltrials.gov that will allow the ISCORE-RC Clinical Trials Service Core
to monitor relevant clinical trials of interest currently in the participant recruitment phase. Aim 3 - Train a cadre
of skilled clinical research coordinators. Entry into this program will be open to experienced clinical personnel
as well as to non-clinical individuals. Both part-time and full-time effort of trainees will be accommodated. The
program will include an online didactic portion, journal club, and seminar series as well as a prominent
experiential component to be conducted at participating sites. Upon completion of the core content, participants
will receive a CRC basic training certificate and will be eligible for further training towards an advanced training
certificate and membership in the ISCORE-RC CRC Academy, a networking and professional development
platform that includes current research coordinators at participating sites as well as trainees."
10931359,"Project 2 SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Ovarian cancer is the second most common gynecologic malignancy and remains the leading cause of
gynecologic cancer deaths in the US. Therefore, there is a critical unmet need for new treatment options.
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has led to a paradigm shift in some hematologic cancers, but
efficacy in solid tumors remains limited, partly due to the lack of highly specific targets and immunosuppression
in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Moreover, the time and high cost of manufacturing autologous cell
products, and the toxicity challenges related to CAR T-cell therapy call for novel products that are universal,
safe, and potent. There is growing interest in using natural killer (NK) cells for CAR engineering since they have
an innate ability to kill tumor cells and they are safe in the allogeneic setting. In a first-in-human study, our group
showed the safety and efficacy of cord blood (CB)-derived CAR-NK cells targeting CD19 in patients with B-
lymphoid malignancies. This proposal aims to build on this platform to develop the next-generation NK cell
therapies for ovarian cancer by enhancing NK cell potency and persistence through optimal co-stimulatory
signaling, cytokine armoring and checkpoint inhibition. We have identified TROP2 as a promising therapeutic
target in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and developed a novel strategy to target TROP2 by genetically
modifying CB-NK cells with a retroviral vector that incorporates the genes for (i) the humanized RS7 single chain
variable fragment targeting TROP2; (ii) DAP10 as an NK-specific co-stimulatory domain; (iii) IL-15 to support
their survival and proliferation; and (iv) inducible caspase-9 (iC9) as a safety switch (iC9/TROP2CAR/IL-15). Our
preliminary data show the efficacy and safety of this approach in vitro and in vivo and support its translation to
the clinic. In addition, we have developed a robust strategy to cryopreserve CAR-NK cells, allowing for the
generation of a biobank of off-the-shelf engineered NK cells that could be thawed and infused at bedside, thus
reducing cost and increasing accessibility. Finally, we have devised a novel strategy to target the immune
metabolic checkpoint CREM to modulate the metabolic fitness and potency of CAR-NK cells in the acidic TME.
We hypothesize that targeting TROP2 with iC9/TROP2CAR/IL-15 NK cells will greatly improve outcomes for
platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and that by targeting the metabolic immune checkpoint CREM we can further
enhance the fitness and potency of NK cells. We will test our hypothesis in three specific aims: In Aim 1 we will
conduct a Phase I/II clinical trial to test the safety and efficacy of intraperitoneally delivered iC9/TROP2CAR/IL-
15 NK cells in patients with TROP2+ platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (Protocol 2022-0687). In Aim 2 we will
apply innovative single-cell proteomic and transcriptomic studies to comprehensively characterize the fate of the
adoptively transferred CAR-NK cells, their interaction with the peritoneal TME, and key mechanisms of efficacy
and resistance. In Aim 3 we will perform mechanistic studies to elucidate how CREM deletion enhances the
metabolic fitness of CAR-NK cells and pre-IND studies in preparation for the next-generation clinical studies."
10931363,"Project 3 SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) is the most common and aggressive type of epithelial ovarian cancer,
and the mortality rates remain unacceptably high. It is well documented that aberrant angiogenesis occurs in the
tumor microenvironment (TME) and angiogenesis inhibitors are important for cancer therapy. However, the
clinical benefit of bevacizumab (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeted antibody) has been limited
due to rapid emergence of resistance in most patients with ovarian cancer. Moreover, therapies targeting the
VEGF signaling pathway can also result in adverse events and interfere with wound healing since VEGF is
known to be also important for physiological angiogenesis. Thus, new targets and approaches aimed at the TME
for improving therapeutic outcomes are needed. We identified epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain
multiple 6 (EGFL6) as the most differentially expressed gene in tumor endothelial cells compared to endothelial
cells from normal ovarian tissues and healing wounds. Our preliminary data suggest that high EGFL6 expression
in tumors is associated with an immune suppressive TME with high M2 macrophage infiltration. To develop a
therapeutic approach for blocking EGFL6, we developed and tested a large number of candidate antibodies; the
final candidates have been humanized. Our in vivo results indicated that these antibodies had robust anti-tumor
effects and reduced angiogenesis in ovarian cancer models. Based on our compelling preliminary data, we
hypothesize that EGFL6 promotes aberrant angiogenesis, and immune suppression, resulting in ovarian cancer
growth and progression. Blocking EGFL6 with a monoclonal antibody provides a novel and effective approach
for treatment of ovarian cancer. We will test our hypothesis under three Aims: 1) To delineate the molecular
regulation of EGFL6 and identify sources of EGFL6 in the tumor microenvironment; 2) To investigate the
biological effects of anti-EGFL6 monoclonal antibody as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, anti-
VEGF antibody, or immune checkpoint inhibitor; and 3) To determine the safety and tolerability of an anti-EGFL6
antibody in a first-in-human, first-in-class phase I clinical trial in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.
Collectively, the work proposed in this project will provide scientific rationale for developing new anti-EGFL6
based therapies. The proposed studies will provide fundamental mechanistic insights into the role of EGFL6 in
regulating immune responses in the TME. Findings from this proposal could significantly impact the clinical
outcomes of patients with ovarian cancer."

Sepsis, the systemic manifestation of infection, causes complex and costly hospitalizations with unacceptably
high morbidity and mortality. Most research focuses on detection of the sepsis within the hospital; however, most
sepsis is community-acquired and thus begins in the home. Nightingale Labs has developed a fully automated
non-contact home bed sensing platform that detects signatures of hospitalizations without requiring any patient
participation. Here, we will test whether the technology can be used to detect infections or sepsis. This SBIR
proposal will evaluate the feasibility (Phase 1) and execute (Phase 2) a prospective observational study to learn
the signatures of impending hospitalizations for localized or systemic infection. The work will substantially expand
the toolkit for facilitating early recognition and intervention to reduce infection- and sepsis-associated morbidity
and mortality."
10756505,"Project Summary
To protect global health and our nation’s security, medical countermeasures (MCMs) for high consequence
pathogens must be developed expeditiously. The planning and conduct of nonclinical studies and clinical
research trials for these MCMs are often performed in maximum containment laboratories or barrier nursing
environments. These environments present unique challenges and require complex solutions to assure the data
quality and integrity such that a regulatory decision can be made to advance the MCM in the regulatory approval
pathway. As such, an educational program to enhance data quality and integrity for regulated studies supporting
the advancement of medical countermeasures for high consequence pathogens was developed in 2013 by the
UTMB in collaboration with the FDA Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats with consistent successful
outcomes as measured through course evaluations. Each course offered in the educational program is
credentialled for Continuing Education (CE) units for the corresponding target audience, to include physicians,
nurses, veterinarians, and quality assurance professionals.
The proposed research is a continuation of the robust, collaborative educational program using problem-based
learning techniques designed to bring the scientific, medical, regulatory community together to educate each
other on the challenges related to these issues and to identify solutions that are acceptable. The overall program
consists of a course to address nonclinical studies conducted under the FDA Animal Rule and clinical research
trials. Online companion courses in Good Laboratory Practice and Good Clinical Practice are included in the
educational program curriculum. In Aim 1 we will conduct a systematic educational program review and form a
DEI Advisory Panel. In Aim 2 we will continuously modify and update delivery of the Nonclinical Course
“Achieving Data Quality and Integrity in Maximum Containment Laboratories.” In Aim 3 we will continuously
modify and update delivery of the Clinical Course “Achieving Data Quality and Integrity in Clinical Trials Involving
High Consequence Pathogens.” Aim 4 addresses course credentialing, program sustainability, expansion into
One Health principles, and resource sharing.
The overall goal of this unique educational program is to provide a learning environment that promotes
collaboration of ideas, provides tools for clinical study conduct, enhances mutual understanding of clinical,
scientific, and regulatory complexities, and promotes the data quality and integrity derived from these regulated
studies. The outcome will be a better prepared, cohesive community of clinical, scientific, and regulatory experts
mutually engaged in, and committed to, the research, development, and regulatory evaluation and approval of
medical countermeasures for high consequence pathogens."

The tumor microenvironment (TME) in glioblastome multiforme (GBM) is often complex, overall
immunosuppressive, and can change quickly in response to different therapeutic interventions. The reason for
our limited understanding of the highly dynamic network is largely because i) current transcriptomic analyses
nearly always represent single time point data from surgical resection specimen, ii) the TME can change
rapidly during treatment and iii) the fact that peripheral immune cell composition generally does not reflect what
occurs inside tumors. In order to design more effective GBM therapies, we will i) require new therapeutic
approaches (drugs, carriers and combinations); ii) tools to serially interrogate TME changes over time so that
emerging compensatory mechanisms of resistance and immunosuppression can be identified. The goals of
this project are to i) test the novel myeloid cell targeted CANDI IL-12 activating therapies as they have shown
remarkable efficacy in preclinical GBM[Lugani et al., 2022, Adv Mat, in review] and other cancer models[Koch
et al., 2020, Cell Chem Biol, 27, 94-104.e5; Rodell et al., 2018, Nat Biomed Eng, 2, 578-588] and ii) improve
our temporal understanding of the GBM TME by performing serial multiplexed analyses. This proposal builds
on three recent novel technologies to address the above problems in new ways: i) FAST-FNA[Ko et al., 2020,
Angew Chem Weinheim Bergstr Ger, 132, 6906-6913; Oh et al., 2021, Clin Cancer Res] to perform serial,
deep multiplexed analyses of GBM, ii) multiplexed SAFE-intravital microscopy (IVM)[Ko et al., 2022, Adv Sci
(Weinh), e2200064; Ko et al., 2022, Nat Biotechnol] to analyze GBM drug distribution and cellular effects at
single cell resolution in vivo and iii) CANDI[Lugani et al., 2022, Adv Mat, in review; Rodell et al., 2018, Nat
Biomed Eng, 2, 578-588], a novel myeloid cell targeted dual immunostimulatory approach to efficiently
jumpstart a GBM immune response. We propose three aims: i) serial analysis of the TME in two murine
models (CT2A and 005) using the new bioorthogonal approaches (“baseline study”); ii) determine the efficacy
of CANDI myeloid activating therapies in GBM and iii) perform mechanistic studies to gain further insight into
the effects of CANDI and how to enhance this therapy in GBM. Findings from these mechanistic studies will be
important because they could reveal at a mechanistic level the treatment's mechanisms of action, and from a
clinical perspective, define which TME components that should be studied clinically. Ultimately, we hope to
improve our temporal understanding of the GBM TME and apply the gained knowledge to the design of future
trials."
10914975,"Project Summary / Abstract
The number of physicians trained to perform surgical oncology research is inadequate when
considering that most patients with solid tumors undergo surgery as part of their clinical
management. Improving the care of these patients is in the interests of the NCI. It is critical that
more surgeons are involved in patient-oriented research and that other physicians be trained in
oncology research related to the surgical management of cancer patients. The three objectives
of this application are 1) To increase the number of well-trained surgeons and affiliated physicians
who perform patient-oriented cancer research, 2) To enhance the depth of research training of
surgeons by offering advanced degrees during their research training, and 3) To increase the
number of minority and female surgeons in the academic practice of surgical oncology. Trainees
will be enrolled in one of two research tracks: Translational Laboratory Science (TLS), Clinical
Science in Oncology (CSO). These tracks will be structured and will include associated
curriculum, and appropriate mentors. However, there will be flexibility to include training in other
research areas and in other research-related skills, which will augment the trainees’ educational
experiences. Surgical residents with a minimum of two years of clinical training will be admitted
to the program, and other non-surgical, yet oncologically related MD/DO trainees may be admitted
but will fill no more than 25% of the trainee positions. There will be a total of four trainees at any
given time. Trainees will enter a dedicated, 2-3 year training period that will include a core
research project related to solid tumor oncology, plus coursework selected to match their research
track, with the option for a Master’s degree in Clinical Research or PhD. Strong emphasis will be
placed on learning skills required for life-long careers in research combined with academic clinical
practice. These will include research ethics, grant writing, research design, data analysis,
budgeting, manuscript writing, and stress management. By this approach, a cohort of young, well-
trained surgeons and associated physicians will be developed who will have the tools to perform
high quality, ethical, translational and clinical research specifically centered on human tumor
oncology."
10887394,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive form of breast cancer with standard therapy involving
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgical management, and radiation therapy. However, the high recurrence rate and
low pathological complete response of TNBC suggest that radioresistance is a critical factor in the diminished
therapeutic efficiency of the current treatment strategy. There is limited literature exploring the specific pathways
responsible for radiation resistance in TNBC, but most data support the role of limiting reactive oxygen species
(ROS) accumulation. Our lab has studied the role of Vascular Endothelia Growth Factor (VEGF) binding to
Neuropilin-2 (NRP2) and initiating several cancer stem cell properties. Preliminary data indicate that radiation
enriches for NRP2 expressing cells and using a function blocking antibody specific to VEGF/NRP2 with
irradiation decreases cell viability compared to either treatment alone in a TNBC organoid. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that VEGF/NRP2 induces radioresistance by altering redox homeostasis and
can be targeted for better therapeutic outcomes in TNBC. This proposal will seek to investigate a possible
role of NRP2 regulating NOS2 transcription and its contribution to mitigating ROS accumulation. I will also use
single-cell RNA sequencing technology to identify the subpopulations of TNBC that are radioresistant and
whether they utilize the NRP2/NOS2 signaling axis. Another aspect of this proposal is to observe the
effectiveness of a function blocking antibody of NRP2 with radiation using an in vivo model. I plan to identify if
this approach reduces the radioresistant clones in TNBC. The completion of this proposal will heighten the
understanding of radioresistance in TNBC and identify a novel molecular pathway responsible for this phenotype."

 Cell-restricted transcriptional modulators play critical roles in the process of selective gene
regulation during hematopoiesis. We have been investigating the molecular and biological function of
Erythroid Krüppel-like Factor (EKLF; KLF1). EKLF is a cell-restricted transcription factor that is a global
regulator of genes essential for the erythroid program. Our proposal builds on unanticipated novel
observations made during the previous funding cycle that extend this long-term study towards innovative
directions:
 We found that EKLF is modified at arginine residues by mono- and di-methylation. The
experiments of Aim 1 will address the context for these alterations and their function, and identify
the enzymes responsible.
 We found that the metabolomes of the mouse Nan-EKLF and human CDA-KLF1 mutant erythroid
cells are altered; this includes a metabolite involved in chromatin-associated changes in histone
modification. The experiments of Aim 2 will examine the global nature of these modifications in
mouse primary cells and in our newly-developed CDA patient-derived cell lines.
 We find that chromatin accessibility is altered in EKLF KO and in the Nan/+ cell. The
experiments of Aim 3 will examine these changes in the context of the sets of decreased and
ectopically expressed genes in these genetic backgrounds, an analysis that will be expanded to
include CDA patient-derived cells.
 We found that the metabolome of the EKLF KO cell is altered, and leads to changes in DNA
epigenetics. The experiments of Aim 4 will globally analyze these changes in the context of the
altered RNA expression and chromatin accessibility observed in the absence of EKLF.
 These studies will be aided by the use of molecular, metabolic, and biochemical analyses,
genetic approaches, and use of primary or minimally manipulated cells that have been newly
established. Elucidating EKLF’s role in regulatory phenomena will continue to illuminate novel aspects of
erythroid biology and the essential mechanisms by which a cell-restricted transcription factor can exert
varied yet highly controlled influences on genetic expression, metabolism, and epigenetics."

Our revised proposal launches the India ENIGMA Initiative for Global Aging & Mental Health - a globally
coordinated study of brain aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), created response to the NIH FOA: Global Brain
and Nervous System Disorders Research Across the Lifespan (R01; PAR-18-834;
https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-18-835.html). Our overall goal is to identify predictive
markers in the blood, genome, and epigenome that influence brain aging in India, to better understand
prognosis, and to support personalized risk evaluations on each continent. We plan to identify
etiological pathways to resilience using the rich biobanking strategy developed by our partners at NIMHANS
in India. To do this, we will leverage our global consortium, ENIGMA (http://enigma.ini.usc.edu), to partner with
dementia research pioneers in India, creating new links between international biobanks, and building research
capacity. By 2020, 70% of the world's population over age 60 will live in developing countries, with 14% in India
(Mathuranath 2012). Recently, attention has been drawn to a “diversity” crisis in brain research, as most brain
research is conducted in Caucasian populations from relatively wealthy backgrounds (LeWinn 2017). This lack
of ethnic diversity means that: (1) we do not know if predictors of health (and disease) generalize to other ethnic
groups, and (2) we fail to collect vital data that could teach us how AD progresses in populations with different
genetic and environmental backgrounds. Our coordinated analyses in US/EU and Indian biobanks will help
identify brain aging predictors specific to India and those that are universal. Specifically, we will: Aim 1. Create
Lifespan Charts of brain aging Trajectories in India using MRI, DWI and Resting State Functional MRI. Aim 2.
Identify Blood and Epigenetic Markers that Predict Brain Aging and AD in India. Aim 3. Using a combination of
multimodal imaging, blood markers, and clinical data to predict clinical decline in India. We test structural
equation models that hypothesize how brain aging depends on lifestyle and psychosocial factors (diet, family
support, drug abuse, literacy, sleep, and depression), as well as sex, education, and AD genetic risk. With novel
machine learning methods, will analyze blood markers and plasma proteomic analytes, to define processes that
are harmful to brain aging. In Capacity Building Aims, we will leverage ENIGMA's successful strategies to train
emerging and established scientists in India to analyze their data with high quality control and precision, with
targeted biostatistical and imaging workshops to bolster capacity. This collaborative India-US initiative will
enable future science initiatives, and equip the NIMHANS team with the necessary tools to train new scientists
and independently conduct high impact research bridging efforts into numerous international partnerships."
10890043,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) have potent activities against HIV, but their therapeutic
benefit in patients undergoing NRTI therapies is limited by significant adverse drug reactions (ADR), resulting
in poor patient compliance and compromised drug efficacy. Our group has recently described an indispensable
role of a lysosomal nucleoside transporter ENT3 in lysosomal homeostasis via deletion of ENT3 in mice.
Intriguingly, ENT3 KO mice manifest clinical phenotypes closely resembling NRTI ADR. The overall objective
of this application is to evaluate ENT3-loss driven lysosomal toxicity as a putative mechanism involved in the
chronic adverse sequelae of NRTIs. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that NRTIs that do not interfere
with ENT3-supported lysosomal homeostasis or the inclusion of lysosomal signaling agents will minimize the
occurrence of NRTI ADR. Aim 1 will evaluate the strategies to avoid NRTI toxicity without compromising drug
efficacy. Our working hypothesis for this aim is that disruption of interaction between ENT3 and NRTIs or the
inclusion of pharmacological agonists of lysosomal-autophagy pathway will mitigate the onset and severity of
NRTI ADR. The preliminary studies that demonstrate the involvement of the cell surface NRTI transporters
(e.g., ENT1, CNT) and not the lysosomal ENT3 for NRTI efficacy, the misregulation of the AMPK and mTOR
signaling axis in the Ent3-/- mice, and the functional rescue of multi-organ dysfunction in Ent3-/- mice using a
pharmacological AMPK activator AICAR; all support this aim. Aim 2 will elucidate the mechanism(s) of
occurrence of NRTI-specific ADR signs. Our working hypothesis for this aim is that NRTIs, when present at
clinically relevant blood concentrations, will inhibit the ENT3-regulated adult stem cell functions resulting in
disruption of tissue repair and regeneration. In addition, we hypothesize that NRTIs will differentially impact the
ENT3 function in adult tissues to bring distinct inflammatory, metabolic and degenerative changes that coupled
with stem cell alterations, will explain the clinically observed NRTI ADR signs. The preliminary studies that
demonstrate the transport of many ADR-producing NRTIs by ENT3, the inhibition of lysosomal adenosine
transport by NRTIs and the perturbation of lysosomal recycling of adenosine in Ent3-/- mice leading to adult
stem cell exhaustion, tissue inflammation and degeneration, and breaches of mesodermal tissue integrity,
which taken together supports this aim. The project will utilize biochemical and molecular approaches, novel
ENT3 probes, newly generated ENT3 mouse models, metabolomics, tissue engineering, pharmacophore
modeling, synthetic and screening procedures and PKPD to accomplish the goals. The successful completion
of the project will provide new insights into the mechanisms of occurrence of NRTI ADR and may have
translational benefit for optimizing treatments (such as long-term efficacy, adherence, tolerability, etc.) in
patients undergoing NRTI therapies."
10857274,"Project Summary
Our proposal is motivated by the need to develop non-invasive tools for monitoring anemia in very low birth
weight (VLBW; birth weight < 1,500 grams) and reduce the number of routine painful, invasive blood sampling
procedures (phlebotomy) that may alter infant neurodevelopment and behavior. Recently, a new smartphone
application [Mannino et al., Nature Communications, 9, 4924 (2018)] that collects and analyzes clinical pallor in
patient-sourced fingernail photos and image metadata has been developed to predict hemoglobin levels. The
app uses a robust multi-linear regression model that incorporates summary color intensity values (average
across pixels) of fingernail photos well as the image metadata generated by the device capturing the image to
predict patient's hemoglobin level. While the current app algorithm is simple and easy to implement, there are
notable limitations. First, it does not fully leverage the rich spatial information available in fingernail photos by
calculating a simple average value. Second, the current algorithm is trained using only adults, whose clinical
characteristics are vastly different from infants. The 95% limit of agreement between the app-predicted and blood
sample-based hemoglobin level for adults is reported as 2.4 g/dL, which is higher than the Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments specification variance of 1.0 g/dL, and will likely increase in VLBW infants given their
tiny, non-specific fingernail beds. Such strict error requirements and heterogeneity in populations demand more
accurate and tailored algorithms than what the current app employs. Lastly, a framework for applying the app to
minimize blood draws across the longitudinal care continuum for VLBW infants is currently lacking.
With these considerations, we propose (Aim 1) to develop a new image analysis algorithm (IAA) that produces
non-invasive, accurate and stable prediction of hemoglobin level. The IAA will be based on a novel principal
component analysis method that provides a non-parametric and parsimonious means to jointly model high-
dimensional photos and image metadata, while fully leveraging their spatial structures and co-varying patterns.
We will also consider a new partial least squares approach as an alternative method. We will train and validate
the IAA based on adult data as well as VLBW infant data. In Aim 2, we will develop a new clustering method to
study sub-population structures of fingernail photos and image metadata and study their relationships with the
underlying physiological mechanisms of anemia. This approach will allow us to formulate a non-invasive image-
based screening tool by identifying clusters of VLBW infants with high anemia risk. In Aim 3, we will develop
data-driven tools that leverage longitudinal, patient-level clinical data and IAA predictions to achieve the
overarching clinical goal of minimizing the number of blood draws in VLBW infants throughout the care
continuum. Our proposal will use the data of VLBW infants monitored at three level III neonatal intensive care
units in Atlanta. The proposed methods are generally applicable to a wide variety of settings with diverse and
complex modalities of clinical data."
10906655,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the past 20 years, the United States (US) has seen a fourfold increase in the prevalence of maternal
substance use disorders during pregnancy. Substance use during pregnancy is associated with adverse
maternal and infant health outcomes. Numerous barriers impede the delivery of well-coordinated and high-
quality pregnancy and postpartum care for women with substance use disorder: lack of access to obstetrics
providers who are comfortable with providing medical care to women with substance use disorders; competing
demands from child welfare and necessary medical services; and limited availability of substance use disorder
treatment programs that allow children and provide parenting support resources. A coalition of maternity care
providers, substance use treatment agencies, state social service agencies, and Medicaid funding partners in
Oregon tested a care model called Project Nurture in three clinics in the Portland area in 2015. Project
Nurture combines maternity care, substance use disorder treatment, peer/doula support, and case
management in a single setting. Access to these services in a single care setting reduces barriers to care and
facilitates increased collaboration among providers, which creates a more supportive environment with realistic
expectations for mothers. Care is delivered in a non-judgmental and trauma-informed manner, which is
important given the high prevalence of stressful life events experienced by women with substance use
disorder. A peer-reviewed study found Project Nurture to be associated with reductions in child maltreatment
and placement of children in foster care, and increases in prenatal visits. Preliminary data from an independent
evaluator also suggest that Project Nurture may reduce preterm births, reduce intensive neonatal care, and
increase engagement in substance use disorder treatment. Oregon's Governor is expanding Project Nurture to
five rural and underserved counties. The objective of this study is to establish the empirical evidence needed to
replicate Project Nurture in other states. While preliminary findings suggest that Project Nurture improves
short- and longer-term maternal-infant outcomes, we propose further investigation to answer three critical
questions: (1) What are the key elements of Project Nurture associated with improved outcomes; (2) how can
these elements be implemented in rural and underserved settings; and (3) what is the effectiveness of Project
Nurture in rural regions and when mothers are engaged in methamphetamine and polysubstance use? Thus,
this study is designed to accomplish the following four aims: (1) Assess the effects of Project Nurture on
pregnancy, birth, neonatal, and child welfare outcomes; (2) Assess the effect of Project Nurture on health care
expenditures; (3) Describe implementation of Project Nurture; and (4) Identify critical elements of Project
Nurture and support replication and dissemination. This study will provide state, regional and organizational
leaders the information needed to replicate Project Nurture and create a safe and de-stigmatized care
environment for pregnant women living with substance use disorder."
10894117,"The impact of the gut microbiota on human health depends on the identity of the species
therein. The mechanisms that lead to differences in microbiota composition between people is
not well understood. We focus on interbacterial interactions between members of the dominant
taxon in the gut of Western adults, the order Bacteroidales. These bacteria compete for space
and nutrients via a molecular nanoweapon known as the type VI secretion system (T6SS). Toxic
protein effectors delivered between adjacent Bacteroidales cells by the T6SS result in cell statis
or lysis, and we and others have previously revealed that this competition results in strain-level
differences in the microbiota through exclusion of target bacteria via killing. Since effectors can
be delivered indiscriminately to kin cells, T6SS-encoding bacteria produce immunity factors that
specifically neutralize cognate effectors. We have previously identified the pervasive presence
of “orphan” immunity factors encoded within large genomic arrays within Bacteroidales
genomes that lack cognate effectors. These acquired interbacterial defense (AID) systems
render the T6SS ineffective through neutralization of cognate effectors and facilitate strain-
exclusion from microbiomes. In this proposal, we seek to understand the mechanism by which
orphan immunity genes are captured aggregated into the most common type of AID system, the
recombinase-associated AID (rAID) system, using a powerful combination of bacterial genetics,
biochemistry, metagenomics, and gnotobiology. We further seek to understand the regulation
and biogeographical role of rAID systems through a hypothesized “competition-sensing”
mechanism that involves a hybrid sensor-kinase pathway. Together, we aim to understand the
impact of Bacteroidales defense against the T6SS on the gut microbiome."
10677636,"The exon-1 of mutant huntingtin protein (mHTTex1) accumulates in the brains of Huntington’s disease (HD)
patients and is implicated in neurodegeneration. The intrinsically disordered mHTTex1 misfolds into a
heterogeneous mixture of assemblies, however, the pathogenic conformers are not well characterized. The
major limiting factors have been the lack of methods to assemble ultrapure mHTTex1 structures, molecular
tools to identify them and models to investigate their neurotoxicity. Towards this end, we have developed
protocols to assemble distinct oligomers, protofibrils and fibrils of mHTTex1 and have generated libraries of
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to defined structures. We plan to characterize the binding of representative
mAbs to conformations in various assemblies using biophysical and biochemical methods, explore whether the
interaction of each mAb with its epitope affects the misfolding, seeding and aggregation in vitro, and examine
the structures of mHTTex1 species upon binding to selected mAbs (aim 1). We have further developed a
diagnostic platform to study the entry of structurally known mHTTex1 species into human neurons and their
aggregation into neurotoxic assemblies. With this model, we plan to identify and characterize the
neuroinvasive/neurotoxic species of mHTTex1, map their pathogenic conformations and determine their
structures with biophysical methods including Cryo-EM. Moreover, we plan to discover the neuronal receptors,
which participate in the entry of mHTTex1 and identify the interacting proteins, which are incorporated in the
neurotoxic aggregates. In addition, we plan to examine for the presence of neuroinvasive mHTT species in the
brains of HD patients and in human neuronal and mouse models of HD to validate the physiological relevance
of the in vitro-assembled structures and any links to disease severity. These experiments may for the first time
identify the structures of neurotoxic mHTTex1 at high resolution, a novel pathway for their production, and may
provide targets for therapy development (aim 2). In aim 3, we will investigate the role extracellular mHTT in
disease in the CNS of HD mice. In one set of experiments, we plan to inject neuroinvasive species of
mHTTex1 into the brains of asymptomatic R6/2Q51 HD mice (express human mHTTex1 with 51Qs) and
investigate their ability to enter neurons, trigger assembly formation and accelerate disease progression.
Moreover, we will determine whether blocking any of the pathogenic conformations of mHTTex1 by AAV-
mediated delivery of recombinant antibodies, which are secreted in the CNS, inhibits the entry, amplification
and neurotoxicity of the injected species. Finally, given that mHTT is present in the CSF and plasma of HD
patients and mouse models, we plan to investigate the therapeutic impacts of secreted recombinant antibodies
on the accumulation of pathogenic mHTT assemblies and progression of HD-like pathology in the Q140 HD
mice expressing full-length mHTT. These studies will fill some of the knowledge gaps on the role of
extracellular mHTT in the pathogenesis of HD and may provide therapeutic targets and reagents."
10893036,"Project Summary
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) comprises approximately half of all HF and is a highly
morbid condition. Pharmacotherapies that are effective in treating HF with reduced ejection fraction have more
modest if any beneficial impacts on HFpEF, potentially owing to heterogeneous definitions of HFpEF and limited
understanding of optimal pathways to target in HFpEF. Our team of investigators has extensive experience in
HFpEF human subjects research. Complementary Dyspnea and Heart Failure Evaluation Programs attract
referral of HFpEF patients as well as dyspneic control patients without HFpEF to the Massachusetts General
Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital (“Mass General Brigham, MGB”). In addition, our team is highly
engaged in assessing therapeutic interventions for HFpEF through robust clinical trials programs. The MGB
HeartShare Team’s PIs are responsible for HFpEF clinical trial conceptualization, design, implementation, and
endpoint adjudication via established core laboratories in echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise testing,
advanced cardiovascular imaging, all of which could be used to support HeartShare. Our team also has expertise
in working with MGB-based electronic health record data, population study data, and clinical trials that inform
our understanding of HFpEF. Our group has used comprehensive cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to
simultaneously quantitate invasive hemodynamics, blood gases, cardiac function, arterial tonometry and gas
exchange patterns during exercise in individuals with conventionally defined HFpEF. We have begun to delineate
contributions of impaired cardiac, pulmonary, vascular, and peripheral musculoskeletal reserve capacity that are
not evident at rest. Our single-center HFpEF phenotyping study already consists of >700 patients with HFpEF
subjected to uniform phenotyping (echocardiography, NT-proBNP, multi-site blood sampling at rest and with
exercise and comprehensive CPET). In Aim 1 we will assemble a collaborative multidisciplinary investigative
team capable of recruiting, phenotyping, and retaining ≥250 HFpEF patients in the HeartShare Program while
also drawing from experience with core lab oversight, bioinformatic expertise in electronic medical record
research, and leadership of network, population cohort, and clinical trial research relevant to HFpEF. In Aim 2
we will refine the diagnosis and subclassification of HFpEF through comprehensive clinical assessment including
multi-modality imaging of cardiac structure and function, perturbational testing with exercise to probe multi-organ
system physiologic reserve and longitudinal remote physiologic monitoring and assessment of frailty and
cognition. We will also expand on our experience with creation of omics-based signatures of pathophysiologic
states in HFpEF and deploy unsupervised machine learning approaches to the derived data. HeartShare will
enhance understanding of HFpEF and our team is poised to translate improved understanding of HFpEF
subtypes into new therapeutic intervention trials in HFpEF."
10922718,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Clinical implementation of Precision Medicine faces major challenges in precision disease stratification and
staging, determining optimal treatment, monitoring therapy response, and overcoming drug resistance and
relapse. To address these challenges, there is a critical unmet need for better biomarkers and tests that
complement current methods for accurate diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of response to treatments. Liquid
biopsy presents an innovative non-invasive modality for precision oncology as it promises to provide a global
view of tumor dynamics. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, are emerging as a new paradigm of
liquid biopsy for non-invasive cancer diagnosis and monitoring. Exosomes are 40-150 nm membrane vesicles
secreted by most cells and have been identified as essential mediators of cell interactions and signaling that
promote tumor metastasis, drug resistance, and relapse. Despite the potential clinical impact of these findings,
precise biological functions of exosomes, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-mediated modulation of
tumor microenvironments, and their potential clinical value remain yet to be determined. This is due in part to
the daunting challenges in isolation and analysis of these nanovesicles with diverse molecular and functional
properties. Here we hypothesize that functional phenotypes of circulating exosomes can provide potent
biomarkers for detecting early malignancy, monitoring tumor progression and metastasis, and assessing therapy
response in breast cancer. To test this hypothesis, we propose the advanced development and validation of a
nano-engineered microfluidic biosensing system capable of integrative analysis of both molecular and functional
phenotypes of exosomes in one streamlined workflow. The research will be performed by three specific aims: 1)
Expand the MINDS strategy to develop an optimal 3D nano-engineered integrative EV molecular and activity
profiling (EV-MAP) nanochip platform; 2) Adapt and optimize the EV-MAP technology for monitoring tumor
burden and therapy response using mouse models; and 3) Evaluate and validate the EV-MAP technology for
potential applications to clinical diagnosis and classification of breast cancer patients. The new technology will
confer superior analytical capabilities to substantially accelerate the functional studies of circulating exosomes.
Harnessing exosome activities for diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic benefit presents a paradigm-shifting
mechanism for precision medicine. While focused on breast cancer in this project, our research will ultimately
create a transformative tool for studies of a wide range of bioactive exosomes in various malignancies to develop
reliable non-invasive liquid biopsy of cancer."
10926854,"ABSTRACT: Career Enhancement Program (CEP)
The mission of the MSCP SPORE Career Enhancement Program (CEP) is to stimulate basic, translational,
and clinical research by recruiting and supporting new investigators in the area of melanoma and other skin
cancers. The CEP provides financial resources for this mission, while the SPORE itself provides a supportive
and stimulating research environment. In the most recent MSCP SPORE grant period, we supported 8 CEP
awardees, all of whom were early-stage investigators (2 Instructors, 1 Research Assistant Professor and 5
Assistant Professors). CEP Awardees have experienced success in advancing their careers (with 6 receiving
academic promotions and 1 assuming a senior leadership position in industry), publishing their work, and
obtaining extramural funding. We will continue to solicit proposals via RFP 1-2 times/year and to use a peer-
reviewed scoring system to prioritize proposals for funding (2-3/year at up to $75K each). The CEP and
SPORE Co-Directors, RMC representatives, Internal and External Advisory Board members participate in the
review process, together with Patient Advocates and additional experts who may be called upon if special
reviewer expertise is necessary. The CEP will track progress of the successful applications and provide
advisors to funded investigators to ensure that they obtain any needed services from the MSCP SPORE Cores
and that they are fully-integrated into the SPORE program. Awardees present their research results to the
SPORE investigators after one year of support in order to become eligible for a second year of support.
Progress toward translation as well as likely impact and innovation determine whether ongoing CEP projects
evolve into future full SPORE projects (as in the case of Projects 1 and 2 in the current application). Awardees
will also be advised as appropriate in the preparation of grant applications for funding outside the SPORE
mechanism and given access to Core resources to aid in this endeavor."
10904857,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among persons living with HIV (PLWH); TB disease rates for
PLWH engaging in heavy alcohol use are 2-3 times those of alcohol abstainers and TB treatment outcomes
are poorer. TB preventive therapy (TPT) reduces the risk of progression from latent TB infection (LTBI) to TB
disease, and is being scaled up for PLWH in many high HIV/TB incidence settings. However, TPT does not
prevent new or repeat TB infection after TPT has ended, therefore PLWH who engage in heavy alcohol use
may be at increased risk for acquiring new TB infection even after receiving TPT. There has been little
research examining the impact of alcohol use on acquiring new TB infection separately from progressing to
active TB disease; this limits our ability to understand the role of alcohol use on the separate phases of TB to
optimize intervention strategies most appropriate for each. We propose to examine the risk of acquiring TB
infection and of incident active TB disease among PLWH with heavy alcohol use after receipt of TPT in PLWH
in Uganda, a high HIV/TB country. Our goal is to inform interventions to reduce the risk for acquiring new TB
infection in this group, including behavioral interventions to reduce alcohol use, and TPT strategies, such as
repeat short-course TPT to prevent active TB disease. First, we propose to examine the acquisition of new TB
infection by level of alcohol use among a cohort of PLWH with prior negative tuberculin skin test (TST) results,
in a sample of PLWH enriched for heavy alcohol use (Aim 1). We will adjust for key confounders such as
cigarette smoking, second-hand smoke, socio-economic status, household crowding, gender, age, nadir CD4+
T cell count, and prior TPT receipt. We will also examine the mediators of alcohol use on risk of TB infection,
such as lack of HIV viral suppression, bar attendance, and low body mass index, to determine if existing
alcohol interventions should incorporate these as additional targets. To accomplish this aim, we will leverage a
large cohort of PLWH including 50% engaging in high-risk drinking, that we previously tested for LTBI from
2017 to 2020 who were TST negative. We will re-enroll 500 persons and conduct repeat TST and active TB
screening yearly, over 4 years, to determine the rate of acquiring new TB infection. We will also determine
whether PLWH who engage in heavy alcohol use and have LTBI are at increased risk of progressing to active
TB disease, despite receipt of TPT, compared to persons engaging in lower risk or no alcohol use (Aim 2). For
Aim 2, we will leverage our prior cohort of 990 PLWH with LTBI who received TPT, with over 5000 person-
years of follow-up and well-characterized alcohol use and TPT electronic adherence measurement. Both aims
will leverage cohorts uniquely suited for these analyses and use objective alcohol biomarkers. These studies
will provide unprecedented prospective evidence needed to effectively target alcohol reduction interventions
and inform TPT strategies—such as repeated short courses of TPT—to prevent new TB infection and reduce
the risk of progression to TB disease for a high-risk group of PLWH: those engaging in heavy alcohol use."
10912551,"Publications by the National Research Council and National Academy of Sciences have highlighted a
continuing shortage of veterinarian-scientists nationwide and the pressing need to train more.
Similarly, the 2014 NIH Physician-Scientist Workforce Report stressed the need for more
veterinarian-scientists and recommended expansion of veterinary combined degree programs. Human
disease outbreaks caused by animal pathogens emerge and re-emerge with unsettling frequency, and
over 60% of all infectious diseases of animals can also affect humans. The complex problems presented
by animal and human medicine and infectious disease biology today are ideally approached by
investigators with broad experience in numerous species and who understand biology in both
molecular and whole animal contexts, as well as wildlife-human interfaces, and environmental
connections with infectious diseases. Our program seeks to directly address this national need through
our VMD-PhD training program in infectious disease-related research which has a strong history of
generating scientists in academia, industry, and government. This program is contained within the
umbrella of our larger VMD-PhD program which has a 53 year track record of success. Our training
program includes focused activies on infectious diseases including as a global heath course, a zoonotic
and infectious disease discussion group, infectious disease-related seminars, annual infectious disease-
related retreats, and externships at government health agencies. This is coupled with infectious disease-
related veterinary and graduate didactic education, rigorous infectious disease-related PhD thesis
research, and veterinary clinical training. The program is further supported by synergistic activities
provided by the larger Penn VMD-PhD and MD-PhD programs. Students receive VMD training at the
Penn School of Veterinary Medicine, and PhD training within one of the Penn Biomedical Graduate
Groups devoted to research in infectious disease-related research: (1) Microbiology, Virology, and
Parasitology, 2) Immunology, or 3) Epidemiology and Biostatistics. Our program brings together 34
faculty trainers with established research experience in the above disciplines. These faculty have a rich
history of predoctoral and postdoctoral training and have trained nearly 300 predocs and postdocs in the
past decade. Throughout the program, VMD and PhD curricula are interdigitated and programs are in
place to bridge the two training programs to provide maximal synergy. Extensive oversight and advising
systems are also in place to provide an efficient and well structured program. Our tracking data indicate
over 84% of alumni are in research careers. In summary, we seek to address a pressing national need
for more veterinarian-scientists through our VMD-PhD program in infectious disease-related research."
10898033,"Project Summary
Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and related inherited photoreceptor dystrophies are characterized by progressive
photoreceptor loss, resulting in poor vision or even blindness. While these disorders are caused by the
mutations of various genes, mutations in RHO, USH2A, PRPH2, RP1, CNGB1, EYS, PDE6A, PDE6G,
PDE6C, PDE6H, GNAT1, and NR2E3 account for a substantial number of cases. We recently performed a
genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of human and murine fetal retinas (which mostly contain retinal
progenitor cells [RPCs]), postnatal murine RPCs, and mature photoreceptors. We discovered that the
promoters of all of the genes above were highly methylated (hypermethylated) in DNA isolated from fetal
retinas and RPCs. The methylation of these promoters was significantly reduced during RPC differentiation
into photoreceptors and accompanied by an increased expression of the corresponding genes. It is generally
accepted that DNA methylation in promoter regions silences gene expression, while DNA demethylation should
occur to allow gene expression. Unsuccessful demethylation of the promoters of the genes above during RPC
differentiation into photoreceptors may reduce or even eliminate their activity, leading to photoreceptor
dystrophies without any mutations in the genomic DNA. Thus, not only mutations in DNA but also retina-
specific epigenetic changes in the DNA may contribute to the pathogenesis of RP and related diseases,
indicating the importance of understanding the DNA demethylation pathway during photoreceptor
development. The ten–eleven translocation (TET) protein family has a vital role in DNA demethylation and
regulates eye development and neurogenesis in various species. Our data and the results of other laboratories
indicate that the TET-dependent DNA demethylation pathway controls photoreceptor development. The
objectives of this project are to gain a detailed understanding of how the TET-driven DNA demethylation
pathway specifies the differentiation of RPCs into photoreceptors, and to investigate how irregularities in its
activity lead to photoreceptor death and retinal degeneration. Using a rigorous experimental design, we will
explore this pathway in accordance to our specific aims: 1) determine whether the TET-dependent DNA
demethylation pathway acts as a “vertical” epigenetic “switch” between progenitor and photoreceptor precursor
fates in the developing retina; 2) determine whether the TET-dependent DNA demethylation pathway functions
as a “horizontal” epigenetic “switch” between rod and cone photoreceptor phenotypes; 3) determine whether
TET enzymes require transcription factors with DNA binding domains acting as TET binding partners to specify
target genes for demethylation and activation during photoreceptor development. To reach these objectives,
we will employ animal models and a wide range of biochemical, molecular, and epigenetic approaches, striving
to obtain robust and unbiased results. Upon the completion of the project, we expect the results to reveal the
role of epigenetic mechanisms in photoreceptor normal and pathological development."
10928775,"Abstract:
Cancers arising in epithelial tissue account for 80‐90% of all cases. Many epithelial cancers could be prevented or cured
by detecting and treating pre‐cancerous lesions and early stage disease. A number of POC technologies have shown
promise to improve cancer screening and early detection of epithelial precancer and cancer, including both in vitro and in
vivo imaging tools, and molecular sensors. However, development and translation of POC technologies are slowed by
multiple technical and clinical barriers. The Center for Innovation and Translation of Point‐of‐Care Technologies for
Equitable Cancer Care (CITEC) is structured to offer “one‐stop shopping” to address these barriers. CITEC will support and
accelerate the development, delivery and equitable use of affordable, effective and accessible POC technologies to screen
and/or detect epithelial precancer and early cancer. The Administrative Core will provide overall project oversight and
management to ensure that all CITEC cores function at a high level, that cores collaborate effectively to achieve the overall
goals of CITEC, and that CITEC is responsive to and synergistic with the goals of the overall POCTRN network.
The first aim of the Administrative Core is to establish and manage the administrative structure, governance policies,
decision making, budget management, and conflict resolution processes and communications plans for the Center. The
CITEC program will be overseen by a CITEC Steering Committee, consisting of the PD/PIs and co‐leads of Cores with equal
voting rights. The CITEC Steering Committee will review progress of cores and individual projects, develop collaborative
protocols, identify technological impediments to progress, select strategies to surmount them and identify opportunities
for sharing techniques and tools developed within individual projects. The Administrative Core will also have primary
responsibility for interactions with NIH and will work with NIH to advance efforts to reach the goals of POCTRN.
The second aim of the Administrative Core is to work to continuously evaluate and improve CITEC, partnering with the
leadership of the Cores to gather and analyze data to identify challenges in optimizing the impact of CITEC activities. To
achieve this aim, the Administrative Core will assist CITEC Cores to build multidisciplinary partnerships; to ensure inclusion
of a diverse community of partners and stakeholders; and to evaluate performance and guide performance improvement.
The AC will develop review mechanisms to ensure that project resources are used effectively to accelerate the
development, translation and equitable implementation of POC technologies to improve cancer screening and early
detection.
The AC will establish an External Advisory Committee; CITEC performance data will be shared with the External Advisory
Committee and, with their feedback, will ensure that CITEC engages in effective continuous quality improvement.
In short, the Administrative Core will support robust, productive and efficient interactions between CITEC members,
funded investigators, the POCTRN network and relevant stakeholders."

The global market for point‐of‐care (POC) tests is projected to grow 12% annually, exceeding US$90B by 2030. Drivers of
market growth include emerging disease threats, increasing demand for self‐testing, successful market shaping
interventions, increasing demand for essential diagnostics in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs), and a trend for
health‐care decentralization. More than a billion COVID‐19 tests are now performed annually at the POC, and the
pandemic testing response demonstrated that: a new generation of high performance, affordable molecular tests can be
manufactured, distributed, and rapidly adapted for new targets; a broad segment of users can accurately perform home
testing; and test results can enable rapid treatment when needed. The POCTRN network contributed significantly to these
successes. Despite the success of RADx and the rapid scale of POC testing for COVID, a number of significant barriers still
remain to achieve the potential of POC testing, especially for the early detection of cancer. The mission of The Technology
Core of The Center for Innovation and Translation of Point‐of‐Care Technologies for Equitable Cancer Care (CITEC) is to
join POCTRN in supporting and accelerating the development and translation of high priority POC technologies specifically
designed for cancer screening and early detection for under‐served populations. The first aim of the Technology Core (TC)
is to identify and support new meritorious projects to develop POC technologies for cancer screening or early cancer
detection from prototype through early clinical testing. In collaboration with the Dissemination Core, the TC will conduct
assessments to identify high priority unmet clinical needs for cancer screening and early detection, and, subsequently,
publish consensus POC Technology Needs Statements. CITEC will issue targeted solicitations offering funding to address
these needs. The TC will support technology projects specifically designed for underserved communities, including those
designed to address challenges and barriers associated with cancer health disparities and low‐resource settings (e.g., rural
settings, settings with limited infrastructure). The second aim of the TC is to assist supported POC technology developers
to refine their clinical needs statement, including target test specifications, and refine and assess technical performance,
usability, and manufacturability of their technology, with the objective of accelerating the path to translation and clinical
adoption. The TC will create a CITEC Core Technology Laboratory with unique and comprehensive technical resources to
support the design, fabrication and rapid optimization of POC imaging technologies, POC molecular sensors, and machine
learning based image analysis strategies appropriate for mobile platforms. The third aim of the TC is to help translate
promising prototypes to clinical validation and commercialization. The TC will work closely with the Clinical Core to identify
technologies ready for clinical evaluation and to support the transition to evaluation in relevant clinical settings. The TC
will work with POC test developers to accelerate efforts to develop commercial prototypes and to develop successful
commercialization strategies, leveraging resources in the Texas Medical Center and in Brazil. Through these aims, the TC
will work with other CITEC cores to build and support a robust pipeline of POC technologies for equitable cancer screening

10928784,"Abstract:
Cancer is projected to be the leading cause of global mortality over the next decade and >75% of cancer deaths will occur
in LMICs. Moreover, underserved areas face disproportionately higher cancer‐related morbidity, in large part due to
inadequate screening and prevention. Lack of access results in initial diagnosis at an advanced and/or incurable stage.
There is a great need to develop affordable, accurate POC tests for cancer screening and early cancer detection that can
be used by local providers and community health workers, and even by patients and families in their homes. There is an
equally great need to validate these technologies in racially and socio‐economically diverse populations and in lower
resource settings, with all their environmental and cultural challenges. Indeed, cancer preventive strategies that work in
HICs often fail in LMICs (and underserved areas of high‐income countries) due to differences in disease characteristics,
health system capacities, environmental (and environmental exposure) differences, as well as racial and genetic
differences. The primary goal of the Clinical Core (CC) is to serve as a “clinical laboratory for innovators” by providing
infrastructure and services to support clinical validation of POC technologies and to evaluate implementation outcomes
for equitable cancer care. The CC will collaborate to validate prototype technologies and establish feasibility and adoption
of these devices in a diverse array of appropriate settings. The first aim of the CC is to evaluate clinical performance,
effectiveness, and usability of prototype POC technologies for cancer early detection in real‐world clinical settings,
including technologies to address cancer health disparities. The second aim is to evaluate implementation of POC
technologies for cancer prevention and early detection, including clinical impact, cost effectiveness and
barriers/facilitators to implementation in diverse clinical settings. Our multidisciplinary team (clinical researchers,
engineers, pathologists, biostatisticians, veterinarians, research coordinators and regulatory managers) has worked
collaboratively for > 15 years on five continents, translating technologies from the bench to animal studies and clinical
trials in the USA, China, India, Africa, Europe and Latin America. We will bring this wealth of experience to facilitate POC
technology validation in highly diverse global settings (US, Mozambique, Brazil etc.). Likewise, we will leverage the core
support of the Texas Medical Center and Baylor (simulation, biostatistics, comparative biology/animal) to provide a clinical
core that provides high quality support, in both depth (translation, validation, regulatory) and breadth (international).
Through these aims, the CC will work with other CITEC cores to evaluate and advance a robust pipeline of POC technologies
for equitable cancer care by identifying high priority unmet screening and early detection needs and ensuring that high
impact technologies are developed, translated and evaluated in a rigorous and safe way that allows implementation,
commercialization and scale‐up."
10928786,"ABSTRACT
The traditional staged pipeline for moving innovations from prototype to efficacy and effectiveness testing to real‐world
implementation generally results in slow dissemination and uptake of effective interventions and technologies. The CITEC
Dissemination Core (DC) will work to accelerate efficient and effective translation and adoption of POC technologies for
cancer screening and early detection by engaging in activities that are crucial to achieve optimal adoption and
implementation. The DC will work to: 1) ensure that clinical and user needs inform device development and design; 2)
proactively assess and address barriers to integrating POC technologies into real‐world health care delivery processes; and
3) train technology developers and end users to develop, evaluate, implement, and commercialize POC technologies for
equitable cancer screening and diagnosis. The first aim of the DC is to collaborate with the Technical and Clinical Cores to
assess, refine, formally document, and broadly communicate high‐priority unmet clinical needs associated with cancer
screening and early detection that are targets for POC technologies to improve equitable cancer screening and early
detection. The DC will carry out on‐site needs assessment visits at multiple global sites including medically underserved
settings in the US, Brazil and Mozambique. The DC will document and publish consensus POC Technology Needs
Statements each year and these will be disseminated broadly in partnership with professional societies. The second aim
of the DC is to develop an implementation science roadmap for introducing POC technologies in low‐resource settings
based on a case study around implementation of an existing but under‐utilized technology for cervical cancer screening.
The third aim of the DC is to provide a portfolio of interdisciplinary training and educational opportunities targeted to
technology developers and end‐users to accelerate the development, evaluation, implementation, and commercialization
of POC technologies for equitable cancer screening and early detection. We will partner with professional societies to
offer engaging, hands‐on pre‐conference workshops. Knowledge generated through these activities will inform and refine
the work of other CITEC cores and POCTRN centers and will help ensure that technology prototypes supported by CITEC
will have a high rate of success for market adoption, scale‐up, and implementation to address global cancer health
disparities."
10928764,"Overall Project Summary
The long-term goal of the Johns Hopkins Center for Innovative Diagnostics for Infectious Diseases JH-C[ID]2 is
to accelerate infectious disease diagnostic point-of-care (POC) technology innovation and access to impact
global public health. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and other emerging and re-emerging infectious
diseases continue to threaten human health. Syndrome-based empiric algorithmic treatment protocols are widely
used since diagnostic test results are often not available as actionable data during a clinical encounter. Since
the clinical presentations of many infectious diseases overlap, these protocols often miss asymptomatic infection
and/or result in antibiotic overtreatment, which contributes to emerging antimicrobial resistance. There is thus
an unmet need for POC and at home infectious disease diagnostics; timely and actionable diagnostic data will
increase the number of patients who are diagnosed and appropriately treated at POC in both the US and in RLS.
COVID-19 and the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics Technology (RADx Tech) Program rapidly increased the
number of platforms and tests available and led to a paradigm shift from centralized labs to POC and self-tests.
The JH-C[ID]2 is well-positioned to continue to catalyze the successful development of POC and OTC assays for
STIs, as well as emerging and re-emerging infections. As the oldest, well-established POCTRN Center, we will
apply the lessons learned from the last 3 cycles to: 1) support the rapid development, commercialization, and
implementation of innovative POC and self-tests for STIs and emerging and re-emerging infection; 2) develop
and expand existing POC COVID-19 platforms toward the diagnosis of STIs and other infectious diseases; and
3) implement functioning core components (Administrative, Dissemination, Clinical, and Technology) to work
smoothly and collaboratively to solicit and support technology that fulfills unmet needs. We have an innovative,
cost-conscious approach that matches devices with the appropriate clinical context and use case for impactful
adoption. With resources from the Center, devices move rapidly along the development pipeline with clear
milestones where go/no-go decisions can be made regarding viability and fitness for use case and value-based
adoption. The JH-C[ID]2 has had a strong track record of supporting both STI and COVID-19 POC and self-tests
that have achieved FDA clearance and Emergency Use Authorization; our clinical sites allow for real-world
clinical studies to assess how POCT might perform in various operating environments. Our clinical and diagnostic
development expertise and approach identify key risk factors to success. Using our network, we aim to promote
the development of accessible infectious disease diagnostics through multidisciplinary innovation along the
development pipeline from research to impactful use in different global settings."
10932156,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The etiology of Barrett's esophagus (BE), a molecularly complex disorder of the distal esophagus, remains
elusive. Patients with BE are at an increased risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a lethal,
increasingly prevalent, and the most common esophageal malignancy in the U.S. Our long-term objective is to
identify the causative mechanisms underlying the onset and malignant progression of BE, and to develop
evidence-based biomarkers and chemopreventive/therapeutic strategies for subsequent clinical implementation.
Project 1 of this program is based on our prior discovery of a novel germline susceptibility mutation in VSIG10L
(S631G) that modulates the epithelial integrity of squamous epithelium. VSIG10L is expressed in suprabasal
cells as squamous epithelium matures. Furthermore, we have generated mice that are either null for Vsig10l or
carry the mouse ortholog of the human S631G variant. Homozygous Vsig10l knockout (KO) and homozygous
S631G knockin (KI) mice are both viable. Electron microscopy imaging demonstrates decreased desmosomal
cell to cell junctions in the suprabasal squamous cells of mice with altered VSIG10L. Further, both mouse
genotypes initially develop multilayered epithelium at 12 months of age and BE like metaplasia by 24 months at
the squamo-columnar junction (SCj) upon exposure to genotoxic/oxidative stress (Deoxycholate). The three
Aims of Project 1 strategically address how mutations in VSIG10L lead to a susceptibility to BE. Aim 1 will define
phenotypic and molecular alterations affected by VSIG10L mutations in three dimensional organotypic cultures.
Aim 2 will define phenotype of our mouse models and identify molecular alterations that lead to BE like
metaplasia and dysplasia. Aim 3 studies how VSIG10L expression is associated with a susceptibility to develop
BE in human subjects. Collectively, our proposed studies will delineate the role of VSIG10L in esophageal
homeostasis, uncovering novel mechanisms of BE-EAC pathogenesis."
10932161,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The etiology of Barrett's esophagus (BE), a complex metaplastic disorder of the distal esophagus, remains
elusive. Patients with BE are at an increased risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a lethal,
and increasingly prevalent disease, and the most common esophageal malignancy in the U.S. Our long-term
objective is to identify the causative mechanisms underlying the onset and malignant progression of BE, and to
develop evidence-based biomarkers and chemopreventive/therapeutic strategies for subsequent clinical
intervention. Project 2 of this program addresses a controversial area in the field that has been understudied.
Esophageal submucosal glands (ESMGs) represent a progenitor cell source in the esophagus and our group
has previously demonstrated increased proliferation and acinar ductal metaplasia (ADM) in ESMGs in the
context of injury and EAC. We have observed immune cell infiltrates in ESMGs associated with ADM, but
important knowledge gaps persist about the types of immune cells found in areas of ADM and the effect of this
microenvironment on ADM, wound healing, and the molecular programs associated with BE/EAC. Project 2 will
thus investigate the relationship between injury-induced cytokines such as C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8
(CXCL8 or IL8)), esophageal wound healing, and ADM. Ongoing inflammation and abnormal signaling in ESMGs
and at the GEJ may provide a persistent source of abnormal progenitor cells after radiofrequency ablation,
contributing to treatment failures including refractory and recurrent dysplasia and progression to EAC. The
proposed project will address preclinical questions about how to improve outcomes after radiofrequency ablation
or endoscopic resection of early lesions, including high grade dysplasia and very early cancers. To address
these research questions, we will use our 1) large human esophagectomy database that includes failed-
radiofrequency ablation cases that resulted in esophagectomy, and 2) our porcine radiofrequency ablation model
and porcine and patient-derived organoids. Our project has strong synergy with both projects 1 and 3, expanding
the scope our program project grant to include models with ESMGs and allowing comparison to wound healing
at the gastroesophageal junction. We will investigate how targeting the inflammation in ESMGs and at the
gastroesophageal junction may provide a potential cancer interception and preventive strategies.

The use of optical imaging to assay structure and function of the visual system at a variety of
length scales, from subcellular structures to living animal and human eyes, continues to expand.
Improved fluorescent probes and an expanding arsenal of new imaging technologies, make
optical techniques for measuring and manipulating cells and circuit function more powerful and
popular than ever. New scanners allowed for rapid volumetric imaging of tissue, new
optogenetic, and opto-pharmacology tallow for control of neural activity by light, new ways of
generating patterns of light (e.g., holography) allow optical stimulation and imaging in intact
tissue. For in vivo applications, adaptive optics and eye tracking facilitate the translation of
modern optical techniques into living animal and human eyes. We are fortunate to have gifted
optical imaging specialist, Ben Smith, who will continue to carry out the work of the Optical
Imaging Core, bringing these and other technologies to Vision Science labs throughout campus.
The Aims of this Core are 1) Leverage the existing expertise and instrumentation that is already
available on campus to bring more Vision Science investigators into the world of advanced
optical techniques, 2) Assist Core investigators in customizing their own imaging equipment to
best take advantage of new technologies, including the light-activated ion channels described
above. 3) Assist CORE investigators in assembling sophisticated imaging systems from
component parts, including confocal and 2-photon microscopes."
10929323,"Project Summary Bioinformatics Core
Vision science, like many fields in biology, is benefitting tremendously from technological
advances that make it possible to collect huge amounts of data about genes, proteins, lipids, and
cellular structures in intact tissues of the eye and brain. Likewise, advances in functional imaging
are making it easier to collect information about activity of neurons in the retina and brain as
they are responding to visual images. While Berkeley scientists have tremendous expertise in
collecting “big data” sets, many investigators and their labs lack the knowledge, resources, and
time to organize, process, and analyze the data to reveal meaningful results. With the entry of a
new Vision Science faculty member with great expertise in Bioinformatics and the availability of
a great local labor pool of highly astute young expert Data Scientists, we have decided to
establish a new Bioinformatics Core that will provide sorely needed to services to Vision Science
faculty. The Aims of the Core are 1) to establish cloud-based pipelines for preprocessing, storage
and retrieval of high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics and imaging data, 2) develop and
maintain bioinformatic pipelines to support downstream analysis of new and publicly available
datasets, and 3) provide advisory and training services on bioinformatic methods."
10884261,"Project Summary/Abstract
This application requests support for years 35-40 of a predoctoral training program in Immunology at
the University of Minnesota. During its long history, this training grant has served as a solid and
consistent base of support for the highest quality graduate students in Immunology at the University
of Minnesota. In doing so, it has played a key role in the development of the first University of
Minnesota graduate program to feature Immunology, the recruitment of over 32 new immunology
faculty, and the establishment of the multi-departmental Center for Immunology that now coordinates
all University of Minnesota research and educational activities in this field. Most predoctoral students
who seek training in Immunology enroll in the Microbiology, Immunology, and Cancer Biology
(MICaB) Graduate Program. They take graduate level courses in cell and molecular biology and a
rigorous semester-long foundational course designated ""Immunity and Immunopathology"" and an
in-depth and intensive course called ""Current Topics in Immunology"". Predoctoral students are
chosen for this training grant usually in their second or third year of training, through a competitive
selection process based on research productivity and potential. All T32 preceptors vote to choose the
new trainees. Once elected, students are supported for 2 years to conduct research in the laboratory
of one of 28 preceptors whose interests broadly cover the field of Immunology. Supported students
participate in research-in-progress meetings, journal clubs, and seminars featuring outside speakers.
Trainees typically complete their research after 2-3 years, often publishing their work in high-impact
journals, and then move on to postdoctoral training at top research institutions. The quality of the
research produced by students supported by this training grant reflects an outstanding research
environment, where faculty are highly invested in the success of trainees. Enhancing diversity in our
trainers and trainees is a strong component of the current application. This training grant is the only
vehicle available at the University of Minnesota to enhance predoctoral-training in Immunology."

Social learning is key for acquiring knowledge about the world and for deciding how to act in social situations.
By allowing individuals to learn the consequences of actions in the environment without having to directly
experience them, social learning abilities are evolutionary advantageous. Yet they vary widely across individuals,
and deficits are common in a number of disorders associated with impaired social function, such autism spectrum
disorders. Autism affect nearly 2% of births in the US, and exhibits high comorbidity with other disorders, such
as social anxiety. Symptoms in common include social withdrawal and difficulties navigating social interactions,
and can cause challenges during clinical assessments and treatment decisions. To address these challenges,
we need to provide a better characterization of the mechanisms underlying deficits in social function. This project
aims to do so by developing a novel task battery assessing multiple aspects of social learning and an integrative
neuro-computational framework dissecting the underlying mechanisms, both in the general population, in relation
to symptom dimensions relevant to psychopathology (such as social anxiety), and in individuals with autism.
During the K99 phase of the award, under the mentorship of Dr. John O’Doherty at Caltech, the candidate will
receive training in advanced computational methods (with Dr. Yisong Yue), and in biological and clinical
psychiatry (with Dr. Ralph Adolphs and Dr. Jamie Feusner). In Aim 1, the candidate will establish a hierarchical
computational modelling framework to characterize social learning across a battery of three tasks - observational
learning, social integration and dynamic trust learning. In Aim 2, a trans-diagnostic approach will be used in a
large-scale online study to link individual differences in social learning computations with symptoms dimensions
relevant to psychopathology, particularly autistic traits and social anxiety. During the R00 phase of the award,
the candidate will combine her computational and psychiatry training to investigate social learning in individuals
with autism and matched controls. Participants will complete the social learning task battery both behaviorally
(Aim 3) and while undergoing fMRI (Aim 4). This will determine the task battery’s test-retest reliability, and
identify social learning computations that are altered in autism and those that vary along relevant symptom
dimensions identified in Aim 2. The fMRI findings will illuminate the neural computations and functional
connectivity patterns associated with social learning and their alterations in autism. Using cutting-edge
computational modelling and neuroimaging methods, this project will refine our understanding of social
dysfunction and will contribute methodological and conceptual innovations to advance the burgeoning field of
computational psychiatry. In the long term, such computational characterization of psychiatric deficits has the
potential to inform policies and clinical interventions to improve social function. This Pathway to Independence
award will allow the candidate to reach her training and research goals, form new collaborations, and overall
paves the way for a successful transition to independence."
10890099,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Oxylipins are oxygenated bioactive lipids derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids that have diverse and
integral functions in health and disease, including inflammation, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. Oxylipins
are short-lived, locally acting signaling molecules that are synthesized on demand by cyclooxygenases (COX),
lipoxygenases (LOX), or cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. Advances in lipidomics have led to the detection
of disease-specific changes in oxylipins. Although the identification of disease-specific changes in oxylipins has
the power to be used for disease diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment, the translation of lipidomic studies into the
clinic remains challenging due to a lack of biological understanding of oxylipins. To better understand the
clinical relevance of disease-specific changes, we identified critical gaps in our knowledge that need to be
addressed, including 1) what mechanisms regulate the coordinated synthesis of multiple oxylipins leading to
cell-specific oxylipin patterns; and 2) how the signals elicited from individuals oxylipins are integrated into
biological functions. To address these gaps in our knowledge, the long-term goal of our research program is
to decipher the signaling mechanism responsible for the synthesis and function of individual oxylipins to
understand the functional consequence of their alterations in diseases. Without further mechanistic insights
into disease-specific changes in oxylipins, it is unlikely novel oxylipins will be effectively targeted for clinical
purposes. Platelets are the ideal model system to study oxylipin biology because they produce nanomolar
levels of approximately 15 oxylipins from COX and 12(S)-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) and offer a simplified model
to study the biological consequences of oxylipin dysregulation. In this proposal, we will focus on the function of
12-LOX and its arachidonic acid (AA)-derived metabolite, 12-HETE, which have broad clinical and biological
significance. However, due to the lack of consensus on the function of 12-HETE, the mechanism by which 12-
LOX contributes to inflammation, cancer progression, and clotting is controversial and represents a substantial
knowledge gap. This proposal will study 12-LOX and 12-HETE as a prototypical examples to address its role in
disease, and develop tools to characterize the function of oxylipins by using gene-edited human
megakaryocytes, which have been shown to faithfully recapitulate the donor-derived platelets. Our short-term
goals are to 1) determine the intracellular mechanisms used to release and deliver substrate to 12-LOX and 2)
identify the downstream signaling pathway(s) activated by 12-HETE in platelets. Our studies will provide
valuable insight into the mechanistic understanding of oxylipin synthesis and function that could ultimately aid
in developing new therapeutic approaches for a broad range of diseases."

We have made important contributions to the immunobiology of cancer neoantigens, and have developed a
robust, publically available, and frequently downloaded suite of software tools for neoantigen prediction. With
support from our previous SPORE in Pancreatic Cancer and SU2C, we have now completed enrollment to two
phase 1 clinical trials in PDAC testing neoantigen DNA vaccines (NCT03122106) and synthetic long peptide
(SLP) vaccines (NCT03956056). Preliminary analyses confirm that both neoantigen vaccine platforms can
induce robust immune responses, and suggest that PDAC patients treated with neoantigen vaccines have
better than predicted clinical outcomes. We recently developed algorithms for the prioritization of class II
neoantigens and demonstrated that optimized vaccines incorporating both class I and II neoantigens improve
the success of neoantigen vaccines. With funding from Leidos Biomedical Research, we are currently testing
optimized neoantigen SLP vaccines in PDAC patients using a window trial design (NCT05111353).
Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that optimized neoantigen vaccines can increase the number and improve
the function of neoantigen-specific T cells in PDAC. We are currently testing optimized neoantigen
vaccines in PDAC patients following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the window prior to surgery
(NCT05111353). The window clinical trial design provides the opportunity to study neoantigen-specific T cell
responses in the tumor microenvironment (TME) after vaccination. In Aim 1, we will use biospecimens from the
trial to rigorously assess the functional biology of neoantigen-specific T cells present in the TME using coupled
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and TCR sequencing.
Aim 2: Test innovative strategies to address the paucity of cDC1 in PDAC. We have made important
contributions to understanding the development and biology of cDC1. We recently demonstrated that cDC1
orchestrate CD4 and CD8 immune responses in cancer, and that PDAC impairs development of cDC1,
restraining antitumor immunity. We are currently testing an innovative strategy to expand and license cDC1 in
PDAC (NCT04536077). We will test innovative strategies to enhance neoantigen vaccine therapy in PDAC by
expanding and licensing cDC1 in vivo. We will also test biospecimens from NCT05111353 and NCT04536077
to evaluate the impact of cDC1 paucity on the response to neoantigen vaccines.
Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that the TIGIT pathway restrains the response to optimized neoantigen
vaccines in PDAC. We and others have generated data using human specimens and preclinical models
suggesting that the TIGIT pathway restrains antitumor immune responses in PDAC. We propose correlative
studies to determine if TIGIT signaling also restrains neoantigen-specific T cell responses in human PDAC.
These studies have immediate translational relevance given that anti-TIGIT and anti-PD-1 antibodies are
currently being tested in early phase clinical trials"
10916350,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We propose a phase 1 clinical trial to test the safety and preliminary efficacy of a new therapeutic strategy that
aims at augmenting the efficacy of standard chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer. To date, combination
chemotherapies remain the mainstay treatment of pancreatic cancer. FOLFIRINOX is a combination
chemotherapy regimen with the best track record for treatment of pancreatic cancer that cannot be treated with
surgery; however, even with the best treatment, the majority of the patients will still succumb to the disease
within one to two years of diagnosis. This is in part due to pancreatic cancer cells developing resistance to the
chemotherapy drugs. Another reason for poor survival and unsuccessful clinical experience of immunotherapy
is because of the dense non-cancer cells that surround the pancreatic cancer not only prevent the chemotherapy
drugs from reaching the cancer cells, but also incapacitate anti-tumor immune cells. These challenges support
the need for further research into overcoming resistance to combination chemotherapy and improving the effect
of immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer.
Using an unbiased protein array analysis, we found that pancreas cancer cells dramatically upregulate MK2
enzyme and its partnering molecule Hsp27, when exposed to FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy. Both MK2 and Hsp27
protect pancreas cancer cells from cell death when their DNA is hit by chemotherapy. When MK2 was blocked
by ATI-450, pancreatic cancer cells became much more vulnerable to chemotherapy-induced death. In an
aggressive pancreas cancer mouse model (KPC mice), the combination of ATI-450 plus FOLFIRINOX potently
ablated the cancer, an observation that to our best knowledge, has not been reported. Furthermore, ATI-450
causes immune cells surrounding the cancer to be converted to the types that were more susceptible to
immunotherapy, paving the way for development of an immunotherapy regimen, which we will establish in this
proposal. Importantly ATI-450 is now already in clinical trial for patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid
arthritis and is very well-tolerated except for infrequent, mild dizziness and headaches, which lessens our
concerns of added toxicities when combined with FOLFIRINOX.
In this proposal, we will conduct a phase I clinical trial to establish the safety of combining ATI-450 with
FOLFIRINOX in patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer (Aim 1). We will determine a safe, tolerable dose of
ATI-450 in combination with FOLFIRINOX and get an early indication on whether this combination is more
effective than FOFIRINOX alone. We plan to obtain tumor and blood samples in patients who are receiving ATI-
450 and FOLFIRINOX on this trial and analyze those to confirm that the addition of ATI-450 was useful to
overcome the resistance to FOLFIRINOX, and changed the immune cells surrounding the cancer, as it did in
animal models (Aim 2). Lastly, we made discovery that MK2 activates anti-cancer immunity. By analyzing patient
samples treated with MK2 inhibitor and generating new state-of-the art genetic mouse models, we will investigate
the mechanism and develop a novel MK2 inhibitor-based immunotherapy strategy for pancreatic cancer (Aim
3)."

10916366,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Role of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in Pancreatic Cancer
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating malignancy characterized by a fibrotic and
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that promotes resistance to therapy. Innovative approaches to
overcome the pathophysiology in the PDAC tumor microenvironment (TME) that drive treatment resistance are
desperately needed. The uniquely fibrotic TME serves as a physical barrier to prevent infiltration of T cells and
has limited functional vasculature, which reduces the delivery of chemotherapy. We have recently
demonstrated that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), in which activated neutrophils release their
intracellular contents including DNA, histones and granules into the extracellular space or circulation, are
upregulated in pancreatic cancer, driving tumor growth and promoting fibrosis through pancreatic stellate cell
(PSC) activation. Protein arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) is an enzyme that citrullinates histones to allow for
unwinding and expulsion from the cell and is required for NET formation, providing a potential therapeutic
target for NET inhibition in cancer. PAD4-/- mice have diminished local and systemic NET formation, resulting in
limited tumor growth and improved survival in murine orthotopic pancreatic cancer. We have generated
preliminary data demonstrating that PDAC mice with genetic ablation of PAD4 have enhanced cytotoxic
immune response and increased functional vasculature. The objective of this application is to identify the
impactful mechanisms through which NETs promote treatment resistance to immunotherapy and
chemotherapy. We will explore the impact of PAD4 ablation on spontaneous transgenic Kras and p53
mediated PDAC. In Aim 1, we will thoroughly evaluate the immune response to PAD4 ablation/inhibition with a
focus on how reduction in PSC activation as a result of diminished NETs enhances T cell infiltration and
function, promoting response to immunotherapy. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the changes that NETs have on
angiogenesis, functional vasculature and delivery of cytotoxic chemotherapy. These studies will support
translation of novel therapeutic approaches in combination with standard of care chemotherapy and
immunotherapy to maximize treatment response in this devastating disease."
10916369,"ABSTRACT - Immune Regulation of Gastric Cancer
Gastric cancer is the 4th leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Over 90% of gastric cancers are associated
with long-term Helicobacter pylori infection. However, the infection alone has limited pathogenic effects on the
gastric mucosa. Rather, the infection triggers massive gastric inflammation, which becomes increasingly hyper-
active, damaging the stomach and creating the requisite environment for carcinogenesis. However, the mecha-
nisms and pathways that regulate the onset of hyperactive inflammation are unknown. Glucocorticoids are potent
anti-inflammatory steroid hormones produced by the adrenal glands. We have shown that glucocorticoids are
critical for suppressing pathogenic gastric inflammation. Adrenalectomized mice spontaneously develop massive
gastric inflammation driving a potentially pre-neoplastic condition called Spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing
metaplasia (SPEM). Glucocorticoid signaling is also disrupted in gastric cancers, but the role of these hormones
in gastric cancer development and progression has not been studied. The overall goal of this proposal is to
establish the role of glucocorticoids in preventing Helicobacter-induced gastric cancer development. Our prelim-
inary data suggest that endogenous glucocorticoids are critical regulators of the gastric inflammatory response
to Helicobacter infection. Loss of glucocorticoid signaling accelerates gastric epithelial damage, metaplasia, and
dysplasia. Thus, the loss of glucocorticoid signaling likely accelerates Helicobacter-induced gastric cancer de-
velopment. However, glucocorticoid protection from gastric cancer development has never been studied. Spe-
cific Aim 1 will examine how glucocorticoid signaling regulates gastric T cell activation and polarization. Specific
Aim 2 will examine how long-term Helicobacter infection disrupts endogenous glucocorticoid signaling within the
stomach, promoting hyperactive inflammation even upon Helicobacter eradication. Specific Aim 3 will utilize the
INS-GAS mouse model of gastric carcinogenesis to study whether glucocorticoid signaling protects from gastric
cancer development. Moreover, we will use fresh tumor samples to examine how glucocorticoid signaling mod-
ulates the tumor microenvironment in humans. These studies will be the first to investigate how glucocorticoid
signaling regulates gastric cancer development. Ultimately, the knowledge generated here will facilitate the
launch of human studies and the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to prevent gastric
cancer."
10916378,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Targeting ROS enzymes in immunosuppressive myeloid cells to enhance
immunotherapy
Although immune checkpoint therapy (ICT) has demonstrated long term survival for a subset of patients suffering
from metastatic melanoma, the majority of patients do not respond. The limited success of ICT has, in large part,
been due to the presence of a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Immunosuppressive myeloid
cells (IMCs) are critical drivers of this immunosuppressive microenvironment, promoting tumor growth and
evasion of the immune system. A major challenge in the identification of these IMCs is that the current phenotypic
criteria using surface markers to characterize them overlaps with that used for myeloid cells, including neutrophils
and monocytes, thus, distinguishing this immunosuppressive subset of innate immune cells will be dependent
upon functional characterization. The immunosuppressive nature of IMCs is known to depend upon reactive
oxygen species (ROS). In these IMCs, the respiratory burst pathway is a major source of ROS which is primarily
produced by the enzymes myeloperoxidase (MPO) and NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2). Thus, MPO and NOX2 may
be important regulators of the immunosuppressive function of IMCs. However, little is known with regards to the
contribution of immunosuppressive IMCs, particularly the function of ROS producing MPO and NOX2 enzymes,
in melanoma immunotherapy response and disease progression. The long-term goal of this research project is
to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the function and accumulation of IMCs during
melanoma progression. The overall objective of this proposal is to understand the contribution of the respiratory
burst enzymes to the immunosuppressive function of IMCs. The central hypothesis is that increased MPO
and NOX2 activity contributes to IMC immunosuppression where inhibition of these respiratory burst
enzymes decreases IMC immunosuppressive function enhancing ICT efficacy and prolonging survival.
The proposed aims of 1. Evaluate the contribution of respiratory burst enzymes regulating melanoma ICT
response, 2. Identify IMCs interactions during melanoma ICT response, and 3. Evaluate the presence of
respiratory burst enzymes pathological samples of melanoma, will be conducted using murine preclinical models
and pathological samples to explore the changes in the respiratory burst enzymes. In addition, these studies will
utilize specific inhibitors Verdiperstat, AZD5904 and histamine dihydrochloride for MPO and NOX2, respectively;
these inhibitors are under evaluation in Phase 3 trials for neurodegenerative disorders and leukemia. We
recognize these inhibitors have not yet been utilized in cancer treatments in the clinical setting; these preclinical
studies will provide much needed understanding of basic mechanisms for the translation of their use with
immunotherapy for cancer. These studies will be the first to characterize the role of respiratory burst enzymes in
regulating immunotherapy response in metastatic melanoma."
10916383,"PROJECT SUMMARY – C/EBPβ in bone marrow stromal cell-mediated drug resistance of multiple
myeloma
Epigenetic regulation plays a critical role in numerous biological processes. The overarching goal of my
laboratory is to understand epigenetic mechanisms of drug resistance of hematological cancers promoted by the
bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. This proposal will investigate the transcriptional-regulatory role of a
leucine-zipper transcription factor (TF) called CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) in promoting de
novo drug resistance of Multiple Myeloma (MM) in the context of the BM microenvironment. MM is a disease
caused by malignant plasma B cells mainly residing in the BM. It is incurable largely because of the emergence
of drug resistance. One important contribution to drug resistance stems from the protective effect of the BM
microenvironment, which includes growth promoting soluble factors and physical interaction with cellular
components such as stromal cells, osteoblasts, and matrices. The emergence of de novo drug resistance occurs
in a short timeframe and is reversible, suggesting epigenetic mechanisms may be an important driver. However,
the mechanisms of chromatin regulators contributing to de novo drug resistance of MM in the BM
microenvironment remain largely unexplored. Our work predicted C/EBPβ as a key transcription regulator of
target genes of signaling pathways activated by the BM stromal cells. The BM stromal cells induced a genome-
wide reprogramming in gene expression (transcriptome) and chromatin accessibility (regulome) of MM cells,
mainly driven by soluble factors. Integrative analysis with ENCODE genomic binding data indicated C/EBPβ as
a major contributor to the BM stromal cell-induced transformation of transcriptome and regulome. Our preliminary
results defined C/EBPβ as a promising subject to understand epigenetic mechanisms for the emergence of de
novo drug resistance in MM. We hypothesize that C/EBPβ modulates chromatin accessibility for
transcriptional regulation, and through which contributes to soluble factor-mediated drug resistance in
MM cells. We will test this hypothesis from two directions. In AIM 1, we will first validate the growth-promoting
role of C/EBPβ using CRISPR KO of CEBPB in MM cell lines combined with engraftment model in
immunodeficient NSG mice. Then we will define soluble factor-induced signature genes regulated by C/EBPβ
through an integrative analysis of genome-wide profiles of gene expression and accessible chromatin. In AIM 2,
we will examine the impact of C/EBPβ loss on soluble factor-mediated drug resistance to IMiDs and define the
underlying genome-wide transcription signatures linked to the resistance and regulated by C/EBPβ. Results from
this proposal will establish whether targeting the C/EBPβ pathway is a rational method for the development of
novel therapeutic strategies to suppress de novo drug resistance as promoted by the BM microenvironment for
MM cells."

10902029,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Novel therapeutic strategies to end the HIV epidemic are urgently needed. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) have
emerged as highly promising tools in HIV treatment, and early-phase clinical trials have been conducted or are under way.
We propose to study resistance mutations to broadly neutralizing antibodies in HIV-1 with a focus on subtypes other than
subtype B. While subtype B, prevalent in North America and Europe, has historically been investigated the most, it only
affects ~12% of HIV positive people globally. There is a knowledge gap regarding non-subtype B HIV-1 infection which is
endemic in resource-limited settings, like sub-Saharan Africa. Minority variant resistance mutations have been found to
be associated with treatment failure of ART. There is evidence that similar mechanisms are involved in bNAb resistance,
but the role of minority variants for resistance to bNAbs is less defined, particularly in resource-limited areas. We therefore
propose to use a large collection of viremic plasma samples obtained from HIV-1 infected individuals from two studies
(ACTG A5288 and REVAMP) to determine the prevalence of resistance mutations to bNAbs in HIV-1 subtypes A, C, and D
which together represent the majority of infections worldwide. As minority variants typically are missed on routine Sanger
sequencing, we propose to use deep sequencing to analyze the plasma samples for majority and minority resistance
variants. We will process the obtained sequencing data using a pipeline similar to what has recently been used by our
group for resistance mutation analysis which will be adapted to the current project. We will then compare the resistance
mutation in these HIV-1 subtype C samples with previously published resistance mutations to at least four widely used
bNAbs (VRC01, 3BNC117, PGT121 and 10-1074). For example, we expect to find baseline resistance mutations at the
glycan binding N332 and N334 sites as previously described. In a second aim of the study, we will confirm the resistance
against these bNAbs in phenotypic tests using subtype-specific pseudoviruses by introducing resistance mutations that
we have identified as minority variants. We will use these pseudoviruses to determine the half maximal inhibitory
concentrations (IC50) against the named antibodies. In aim 3 we will look for resistance mutations at baseline and with
any observed viral rebound in children with perinatal HIV infection that will be treated with dual bNAb therapy and
undergo ART treatment interruption. The candidate is a physician-scientist and has completed clinical fellowship training
at the combined Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Woman’s Hospital Infectious Diseases Program. He has
research experience in basic and translational science in innate immunity, host-pathogen interactions, chronic viral
diseases (previous work on hepatitis C) and has now been applying his research skills to the virology of HIV. His goal is to
become an independent investigator in translational HIV research and an expert on HIV resistance. The career
development plan as outlined in this proposal will provide the necessary additional training, mentoring and time for
research to achieve this goal."
10929380,"Project Summary/Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) currently affects ~6.2 million Americans, and this number is projected to increase to
14 million by 2060 unless novel treatments or interventions to prevent or delay the onset of AD are identified.
Harnessing the immune system to prevent or remove Aβ and/or tau pathologies represents a promising disease-
modifying therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD. Currently, all the previous and ongoing immunotherapy
studies target only one epitope of either Aβ or tau protein. Because most AD cases are multifactorial, and
sporadic AD is caused by multiple mechanisms, it is unlikely that a single target will be sufficient to stop or reduce
the progression of AD. Based on the role of Aβ and tau in the pathogenesis of AD, immunotherapy
simultaneously targeting multiple epitopes of both Aβ and tau may present a promising approach for AD drug
development. The long-term objective of the proposed project is to develop a novel, effective vaccine for AD.
The specific goal of this project is to develop a multivalent ""mosaic"" vaccine, termed SNAP-AD, targeting multiple
epitopes of Aβ and tau simultaneously with the spontaneous nanoliposome antigen particle (SNAP) platform and
to investigate its therapeutic effects for treating AD in a transgenic mouse model. Our working hypothesis is that
immunotherapy simultaneously targeting the multiple epitopes of both Aβ and tau is a promising approach for
developing effective AD therapeutics. To test this novel hypothesis, we propose three specific aims: (1)
Formulate and characterize SNAP-AD, a mosaic nanoparticle vaccine comprising three tau and two Aβ peptide
epitopes. POP BIO will formulate and characterize the pentavalent SNAP-AD vaccine simultaneously targeting
tau at one N-terminal region (Tau 6-18), one mid-region (Tau 184-195), and one C-terminal region (pS396/S404),
as well as N-terminal Aβ (1-14) and N-terminal pyroglutamate Aβ (pE3-14), and develop a manufacturing method
with reproducible batch-to-batch characterization and the protocols to quantify each peptide and immunogenic
lipid component. (2) Assess SNAP-AD for immune interference, Th1-biased cellular response,
neuroinflammation, and antibodies’ durability. Immune interference will be assessed amongst the 5-plex
immunogens, and if observed, possible ramification methods will be tested. Cellular responses, Th1/Th2 bias of
the antibody response, and the antibodies’ durability induced by SNAP-AD will be probed. (3) Determine SNAP-
AD efficacy using the 3xTg-AD mouse model. Ten-month-old 3xTg-AD mice and age-matched wild-type mice
will be immunized with SNAP-AD and boosted twice with a four-week interval. One month after the third dose of
immunization, behavioral tests, including general behavior, anxiety, locomotor activity, and cognitive function,
will be conducted, and Aβ and tau pathology will be investigated both biochemically/immunohistochemically. The
proposed studies will reveal whether the multivalent immunotherapy approach has promising therapeutic effects
on AD pathologies and cognitive impairment. A positive outcome of this project would potentially lead to a novel
vaccine for the treatment of AD, which will improve the quality of life of individuals with AD."

Stroke is the leading cause of serious long-term disability and accounts for 4.6 million disabled people in the
United States. Stroke-related costs total over $46 billion in the United States each year.1 Of the nearly 800,000
Americans who have a stroke per year, 87% experience ischemic stroke1, of which 49%-86% are attributed to
either large vessel occlusions (LVO) or medium vessel occlusions (MeVOs).2,3 Mechanical thrombectomy, via
a stent retriever or aspiration catheter, is now the standard of care for eligible patients who experience
ischemic stroke.4–6 While mechanical thrombectomy has progressed dramatically over the past few years,
existing aspiration catheter devices suffer from significant limitations. Major challenges to successful treatment
of ischemic stroke include quickly navigating to the clot and fully capturing it in the first pass while avoiding
thrombus breakage and further downstream ischemia. This project has two aims to address existing limitations
of aspiration thrombectomy. The first aim develops, builds, and tests a prototype aspiration catheter with an
adaptive radially expandable tip. This expandable tip is intended to improve clinical outcomes for all patients
treated with mechanical thrombectomy due to its improved access and navigation capabilities and enhanced
first pass effect (FPE). The second aim tests the efficacy of the novel aspiration catheter using an in vitro
model. This project will lead to the development of a device intended to improve safety and efficacy by
alleviating multiple pass attempts, clot fragmentation, and vessel injury. Through these goals, this project has
the potential to improve the clinical outcome of patients who suffer from ischemic stroke by propelling the field
of neuro-interventional treatments forward."
10892895,"Project Summary
Women have a higher lifetime risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) than men. This increased risk is not
fully explained by differences in longevity, hormones or brain structure. Women who carry at least one copy of the
APOEɛ4 allele, the strongest genetic risk factor for late onset AD (LOAD), have accelerated neuropathology.
However, some studies suggest a faster decline in men, suggesting that sex bias may differ depending on the
stage of the disease. Here, we will investigate how the sex chromosome complement and sex-linked genes
influences sex differences in onset and progression of LOAD. Genome-wide association studies have identified
genetic and epigenetic risk factors for LOAD, but the sex-chromosomes are often excluded in these studies
meaning there is a lack of data on sex-linked genes. Males have unique Y-linked genes and females have higher
expression of genes that escape X inactivation. Interestingly, many of the escape genes are related to immune
function and neuroinflammation is a hallmark of AD, suggesting that these genes may directly contribute to disease
progression. To address the impact of sex-linked genes combined with APOEɛ4 alleles on neuroinflammation in
LOAD we will use unique cellular models and AD tissue for leveraging integrated omics and functional studies.
We will evaluate the functional roles of sex chromosomes and sex-linked genes in brain cell types using human
induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) models. We have derived isogenic pairs of hiPSCs with a different number
of sex chromosomes on the same genetic background (XXY/XY or XXX/X). These new hiPSC lines minimize
variability between individuals, as well as environmental or hormonal confounders. We will generate isogenic pairs
of these lines with ɛ3/3 or ɛ3/4 alleles by gene editing. After differentiation of hiPSC into neurons, microglia, and
brain organoids we will employ a combination of `omic' analyses and functional assays focusing on
neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. This approach will identify sex-linked candidate genes, which will be
tested for dosage effects by knockdown and overexpression. These in vitro studies will be validated in human
tissue collected by the Precision Neuropathology Core from our Alzheimer's Disease Research Center brain bank.
Using pathologically characterized AD brains we will employ myeloid-specific single-nucleus RNA sequencing to
determine the effects of sex and APOEɛ4 genotypes on microglial subtypes and neuroimmune gene expression.
Our new team combines expertise in hiPSC modeling, sex-linked genes, neuroinflammation, `omic analyses and
neuropathology. This integrative study will help understand sex-specific genetic factors and how those factors
interact with APOEɛ4 risk to modulate cellular dysfunction and pathology, thus providing novel insights into how to
tailor a more effective treatment for AD."
10891664,"Project Summary
All animals share motivated behaviors to fulfill their basic needs for survival, including food, water,
sleep, and social interactions, etc. The homeostatic regulatory system energizes behaviors to defend a
target level for these needs (the homeostatic setpoint). For example, human adults, on average, aim to
sleep 7-8 hours daily. What defines the homeostatic setpoint and how is it modulated remain
unanswered questions for all motivated behaviors. Do dedicated neural circuits exist that determine the
setpoint? How are changes in physiological needs detected and translated into modified setpoints?
These questions have been difficult to address, largely due to a lack of simple manipulations that
rapidly and profoundly change the homeostatic setpoints. Protein is a crucially important macronutrient,
and behavioral studies indicate that a wide range of species, including humans, seek to consume a
fixed amount of protein: the protein intake target. In Drosophila fruit flies, mating induces a robust
increase for the consumption of protein-enriched food in pregnant female flies, due to the greater need
for protein in egg production. That change in needs rapidly reset the protein intake target and thus
provides an elegant model to study the homeostatic setpoint for motivated behaviors. Using Drosophila,
we recently identified and characterized the first neural circuit encoding protein-specific hunger. In this
proposed study, we seek to delineate the circuit and molecular mechanisms underlying the
determination and modulation of the protein intake setpoint. Specifically, we plan to 1) test the
hypothesis that the protein intake setpoint is encoded in the hunger neurons by the membrane
excitability; 2) identify the neural circuit feeds into the hunger neurons and resets the protein intake
target; and 3) elucidate the molecular sensors detecting the changes of protein needs. To achieve
these goals, we will employ a multidisciplinary approach, including large-scale genetic analyses,
quantitative behavioral measurements, immunohistochemistry, patch-clamp electrophysiology, and
functional imaging. These investigations will shed light on the fundamental principles underlying the
organization and modulation of homeostatic setpoint for motivated behaviors."
10896220,"Brain injury is a common cause of medically intractable epilepsy. Because we do not understand the
underlying pathophysiology, we can’t reduce the burden of medical intractability. The overarching
goal of this research program is to exploit a recently developed large animal gyrencephalic model of
neocortical post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) to elucidate a mechanism of neocortical epileptogenesis:
chronic compromise of the ionic basis for GABA-mediated inhibition. Disinhibition is a fundamental
element of ictogenesis, but thus far we have not found the mechanism of disinhibition in chronic
epilepsy. There are two salient clues: first, anticonvulsants that increase GABA conductance often do
not ameliorate PTE; and second, studies in human intractable epilepsy have found a positive,
disinhibitory shift in the reversal potential for GABAA receptor-mediated membrane currents (EGABA).
Here we will test the hypothesis that glial reconstruction of the brain’s extracellular matrix after injury
results in increased displacement of extracellular chloride (Cl-o) by the sulfate moieties of the
proteoglycans that comprise the new matrix. To test this hypothesis, we will employ a large-animal
PTE model in which local epileptogenesis occurs after well-characterized neocortical injury (Project 1
and Large Animal Core). This localization of epileptogenesis is critical for correlation of changes in Cl-o,
network structure, and epilepsy. In this injured neocortical area, we will use longitudinal 2-photon in
vivo calcium imaging to test for the network changes expected from disinhibition (Project 2 and
Microscopy Core). In the injured neocortical area, we will use 2-photon Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging
(FLIM) and newly-synthesized Cl- indicators to test for changes in the local Cl-o and intracellular chloride
(Cl-i ) that would drive disinhibition by depolarizing EGABA and reducing the efficacy of shunting inhibition
(Project 3). The 3 projects have a common third aim: to correlate epileptogenesis (Project 1) with
network disinhibition (Project 2) that are associated with chronic changes in Cl-o and Cl-i (Project 3).
Together, these Projects and Cores will test a novel mechanism of epileptogenesis and medical
intractability that could be ameliorated by short-term inhibition of the disassembly of the brain’s
extracellular matrix at the time of injury using MMP inhibitors whose efficacy will be screened in Project
3, Aim 2."
10925278,"ABSTRACT – PROJECT 1
The ability to overcome the development of chemotherapy resistance and maintain sensitivity to the most
effective chemotherapy in ovarian cancer, platinum, is critical to improving outcomes in ovarian cancer. The
ovarian cancer tumor microenvironment (TME) is an important, though understudied, mediator of treatment
resistance. Specifically, the stromal composition of this TME dramatically influences how cancer responds to
chemotherapy, yet no strategies exist to target the cancer-supportive properties of the stromal TME.
Carcinoma-associated mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (CA-MSCs) are stromal progenitor cells that dictate
the composition and function of the stromal TME. CA-MSCs strongly promote the development of
chemotherapy resistance through the secretion of growth factors such as BMP2 and BMP4 and alteration of
the extracellular matrix (ECM). CA-MSCs arise from cancer mediated epigenetic reprogramming of normal
MSCs through altered genomic localization of the histone methyltransferase EZH2. WT1, a transcription factor
highly upregulated in CA-MSCs, appears to drive this altered genomic localization of EZH2 necessary for CA-
MSC formation. Importantly, the CA-MSC phenotype appears to be reversible and CA-MSC reversion or
‘normalization’ correlates with improved sensitivity to platinum and patient survival. Our preliminary data
indicate pharmacologic inhibition of EZH2 blocks the reprograming of MSC into CA-MSC and increases CA-
MSC normalization to prevent chemotherapy resistance. We thus hypothesize that inhibiting EZH2 will disrupt
stromal support of ovarian cancer leading to improved treatment response, reduction in metastasis, and
delayed disease recurrence with maintenance of platinum sensitivity. We propose to:
Aim 1: Conduct a phase 1 dose-escalation study of the second generation EZH2 inhibitor, CPI-0209, in
combination with Carboplatin in platinum sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer.
Aim 2: Determine the impact of EZH2 inhibition on the ovarian stromal TME.
Aim 3: Determine the role of WT1 in mediating EZH2-driven CA-MSC reprogramming and
chemotherapy resistance.
Upon completion of this work, we will have determined the potential for using CPI-0209 in combination with
platinum chemotherapy in recurrent ovarian cancer to prevent stromal-mediated chemotherapy resistance. We
will also define the ability of CPI-0209 to induce CA-MSC normalization in patients. Further, we will have
identified the mechanism of WT1 mediated EZH2 genomic localization during CA-MSC reprogramming
enabling future, more focused targeting of the CA-MSC phenotype. Collectively, this work represents a novel
approach to enhancing ovarian cancer chemotherapy sensitivity by targeting the cancer stromal TME."

Prostate cancer (PC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality and represents one of
the largest health disparities in the US, with men of African ancestry having the highest incidence and mortality
rates. Additional risk factors for PC include older age, family history of PC, and germline genetics. We previously
reported that rare germline variants in DNA repair genes (gDRG) are enriched in men with lethal/metastatic PC.
We have also developed a novel multi-ancestry polygenic risk score (PRSm) that is highly predictive of PC risk
across diverse populations and associated with a younger age at PC diagnosis and conversion from active
surveillance to treatment. The combined impact of gDRG and PRS on PC progression is not well understood,
particularly in multi-ancestry patients. In this Project, we will use a population-based approach to identify and
recruit diverse, non-European, multi-ancestry PC patients, examine the interplay between rare variants in gDRG
(e.g., BRCA2) with PRSm and the association with PC clinical features. To accomplish this, we will also develop
a clinical-grade paired tumor-germline assay, which will additionally enable large-scale examination of gDRG in
combination with high PRSm using tumor molecular profiles. We will also parse out specific, individual variants
that contribute the greatest effect on a high PRSm, Finally, we will conduct a tailored PC screening clinical trial
for individuals at highest risk of PC due to gDRG and determine patterns of interest, enrollment and adherence
to PC screening. Together, we seek to address and mitigate health care disparities related to prostate cancer
genetics, and the factors influencing clinical implementation. Ultimately, we seek a better understanding of the
interplay between rare gDRG variants and PRSm for a combined analysis of germline genetic information to
improve risk prediction and tailored PC screening for men across a broader populations."

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), which includes alcohol-associated cirrhosis (AAC) and alcohol-
associated hepatitis (AH), is now the leading indication for liver transplant (LT) in the US. Early LT (eLT),
defined as LT evaluation with <6 months of alcohol abstinence, is associated with acceptable outcomes for AH
in retrospective studies. However, prospective, multi-center data including biopsychosocial factors on eLT for
all advanced ALD in racially, culturally, and socioeconomically diverse populations are lacking. It is known that
alcohol cessation is the most important factor influencing survival in ALD, and integrated alcohol use disorder
(AUD)/ALD care is critical to help patients achieve abstinence, yet the degree of care integration and how this
influences post-LT outcomes has not been systematically studied. Knowledge gaps in eLT for ALD include: a)
limited data on who gets referred for eLT and referral barriers; b) lack of standardized biopsychosocial
measures and outcomes; and c) minimal stakeholder involvement beyond LT providers. There is an urgent
need to (1) define factors influencing eLT referral, (2) develop risk prediction models of key patient-centered
outcomes, (3) incorporate validated biopsychosocial measures into models, and (4) evaluate the impact of
integrated care on outcomes following eLT. For example, The INTEGRATE collaborative, comprised of
diverse, multidisciplinary clinicians and researchers from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,
University of Michigan, University of Miami, and Columbia University-Weill Cornell Medicine, is ideally
positioned to address these urgent research needs. Collectively, we have developed a distinctive investigator
team with diversity in: (1) career stage (2) sex and race/ethnicity, (3) clinical and methodological expertise in
ALD, AUD, LT, behavioral research, risk modeling, data harmonization, health disparities, causal inference,
and mixed-methods research, and (4) documented track record of NIH funding in LT access, organ allocation,
LT outcomes and healthcare disparities, and NIAAA funding in ALD/AUD. Our large volume transplant centers
with established protocols for eLT for ALD applied to highly diverse populations will facilitate the following aims:
1) characterize and develop risk prediction models for transplant-free survival among those with limited access
to LT to define those in greatest need of eLT referral and listing; 2) evaluate barriers and facilitators to referral
for eLT in ALD; 3) apply causal inference approaches to observational data to evaluate biopsychosocial factors
and develop risk models predictive of outcomes at key timepoints in eLT for ALD; 4) define stakeholder
perceptions and preferences for selection and outcomes in eLT for ALD; and 5) evaluate how integrated care
processes influence outcomes in eLT for ALD. At the conclusion of this work, we will have collaboratively: (1)
defined factors for referral and waitlisting for eLT in ALD (selection), (2) identified which biopsychosocial
factors are causally related and predictive of outcomes most important to stakeholders (outcomes) and (3)
determined how integrated care influences stakeholder-relevant outcomes in eLT for ALD (management)."

Stem cells are required for tissue maintenance and repair during the lifetime of an organism. Altered organism
physiology can influence tissue homeostasis through disruption of endocrine tissues, resulting in changes in fat
cell metabolism, steroid and hormone levels, and secretion of circulating factors within the body. Secreted
factors communicate the physiological status of distant organs to one another. Nuclear receptors (NRs) are
broadly expressed transcription factors with ligand-binding domains that mediate the effects of circulating
factors throughout an organism. NRs are major regulators of energy homeostasis, including carbohydrate
metabolism, fatty acid synthesis, and beta oxidation and play important roles in stem cell differentiation,
metabolism, and tissue homeostasis. However, the mechanisms used by NRs to modulate the transcriptional
landscapes in multiple organs and cell types to control distal stem cell lineages for proper tissue function are
understudied. The Drosophila melanogaster ovary is an ideal model to understand how inter-organ
communication mediated by NR signaling influences germline stem cell (GSC) lineages. Previous studies have
shown that NRs act directly in GSCs to regulate oogenesis; however, there is emerging evidence that the
activity of NRs in peripheral tissues indirectly influence the GSC lineage. For example, the NR Seven-Up (Svp)
acts within adipocytes to influence GSC maintenance and early germline cyst survival and in hepatocyte-like
cells to regulate survival of vitellogenic egg chambers. In addition, Hr4 is required in adult muscle to maintain
GSCs and promote follicle growth. The goal of our research program is to determine how signaling
downstream of transcription factors in different tissues influences circulating factors that regulate stem cell
lineages and tissue function. In this proposal, we will use a combination of genetics, cell biology, and next-
generation sequencing to address two major questions using NRs and the Drosophila ovary as models: 1) How
do transcription factors coordinate their activity in multiple tissues and cell types to regulate stem cell behavior?
2) How is NR directed energy homeostasis maintained in organs to ensure survival of stem cell lineages and
maintain tissue function? Overall, these projects will provide the foundation towards understanding the
downstream mechanisms used by transcription factors in peripheral tissues to influence the behavior of adult
stem cell lineages. Furthermore, this work will inform future studies focused on understanding how disrupted
endocrine signaling results in tissue and organ failure."

The potential of checkpoint immunotherapy to combat cancer has been established in several cancer types.
However, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), checkpoint immunotherapy has not yet led to clinical
benefits. Although multiple factors likely contribute to checkpoint resistance, one significant factor is extensive
infiltration of PDACs by multiple lineages of immunosuppressive myeloid cells. These myeloid cells, which
include tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), drive T cell
exclusion and dysfunction. Thus, one promising therapeutic strategy is to reprogram these myeloid cells to
improve T cell-mediated immunity. Our team has recently developed an allosteric AGONIST of CD11b, GB1275.
Our published data demonstrate that CD11b-agonism rapidly repolarizes TAMs to support anti-tumor immunity
and combining CD11b-agonists with checkpoint immunotherapy leads to tumor regression and long-term survival
in pre-clinical PDAC models. These strong data drive our hypothesis that CD11b agonism reprograms the
PDAC tumor microenvironment to overcome resistance to checkpoint immunotherapy. To test this
hypothesis, we will:
Aim 1: Determine the safety and efficacy of GB1275, Gemcitabine and Abraxane and PD-1 blockade in
metastatic PDAC patients.
Aim 2: Determine the biomarkers of exposure, response, and resistance to GB1275 therapy in PDAC
patients.
Aim 3: Determine how tumor-intrinsic and extrinsic factors regulate the impact of CD11b agonist therapy.
Impact: These studies will investigate a novel approach to render PDAC responsive to immunotherapy."

The Developmental Research Program (DRP) of the Pacific Northwest (PNW) Prostate Cancer SPORE is de-
signed to solicit, evaluate, and support innovative pilot projects in translational prostate cancer research. Projects
funded under the DRP are intended to rapidly advance a new idea or concept that has the potential to substan-
tially impact our understanding of prostate cancer, and ultimately influence the clinical management of this dis-
ease through improved prevention and treatment strategies. Since the inception of the PNW Prostate Cancer
SPORE, the infrastructure of the DRP has established mechanisms to quickly respond to translational research
opportunities within the PNW SPORE institutions that require support to advance hypotheses or confirm feasi-
bility in order to justify larger resource investments. Developmental projects include research in basic science,
clinical science, and population-based studies, and will continue to build collaborations between PNW SPORE
sites and other institutions with SPOREs in prostate cancer.
The Specific Aims for the Developmental Research Program are to:
1. Stimulate the development of innovative, impactful early-phase research studies that include multi-discipli-
 nary interactions with basic, clinical, and population scientists across the PNW Prostate SPORE institutions
 and including inter-SPORE collaborative studies;
2. Provide funding (1-2 years) and infrastructure (e.g., biospecimens, biostatistical support) to rapidly test the
 feasibility of original investigator-initiated projects in all areas of PC research;
3. Prioritize funding to rapidly exploit new opportunities or support specific areas of strategic importance for
 advancing the translational research goals of the PNW Prostate SPORE;
4. Advance early stage scientific research that addresses prostate cancer health disparities and promote re-
 search directed by scientists from underrepresented minority groups; and,
5. Monitor (and facilitate) the progress of each DRP project and consider their advancement to a full SPORE

10825602,"Project Summary/Abstract
Young-adult men who have sex with men (YMSM)—especially Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic White
YMSM—are at heightened risk for HIV infection. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective at
reducing HIV risk when taken as directed. Therefore, promoting PrEP—for example, through public health
communication messages—represents a key public health strategy toward the long-term objective of reducing
the spread of HIV. Despite PrEP's health benefits and despite YMSM's high levels of PrEP awareness, only a
fraction of YMSM use PrEP. In December 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration approved long-acting
injectable PrEP as a safe, highly effective alternative to oral PrEP. At present, YMSM know little about
injectable PrEP but express great interest in it and in seeking more information about it. Exposure to health
messaging is a necessary first step for health messages to influence behavior, so as YMSM seek out
information about injectable and oral PrEP, it is imperative to understand what kind of health information they
seek out about PrEP and what factors underlie those selection preferences. The overarching goal of the
proposed studies is to apply health communication theories of information seeking, selective media exposure,
and persuasion to examine the various types of health messaging strategies YMSM are most likely to engage
with when seeking content about PrEP online (e.g., information about PrEP's effectiveness, an exemplar's
testimony). Aim 1 is to determine the messaging strategies that enhance YMSM's engagement with PrEP
messages, considering whether these message engagement patterns are moderated by PrEP type (injectable
vs. oral). Aim 2 is to test demographic (e.g., race/ethnicity) and psychographic (e.g., perceived stigma)
predictors of engagement with these messaging strategies. Aim 3 is to identify how selective engagement with
different PrEP messaging strategies predicts intentions to use PrEP. We will accomplish these aims by
conducting three studies with PrEP-eligible YMSM (equal portions of Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic
White), using qualitative and quantitative methods. In Study 1, we will convene focus groups (N = 60) to
inductively gather insights about YMSM's preferred (and avoided) messaging strategies. Study 2 (N = 600) and
Study 3 (N = 75) will be randomized experiments in which YMSM browse a mock Internet search results page
for information about PrEP. To avoid biases associated with self-reported message engagement, Studies 2
and 3 will unobtrusively track browsing behaviors (e.g., clicks). Study 3 will also include the collection of visual
behavior data via mobile recruitment methods. Findings will provide actionable guidance for practitioners about
the PrEP messages most likely to engage Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic White YMSM's attention in
service of the ultimate goal of moving them down the HIV care continuum. This R21 will set the stage for an
R01 assessing (a) how messaging strategies engage attention when competing with other online content in a
social media context and (b) PrEP behavior as an outcome of message engagement over time."
10844604,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The immune system has pivotal influence in the evolution and progression of many tumor types, including
colorectal cancer (CRC). In particular, the presence of a strong T cell response in CRC, indicating activation of
the adaptive immune system, has been associated with better patient outcomes. As such, recently developed
immunotherapeutic approaches often attempt to harness the adaptive immune response. Immune cells are an
integral component of the tumor microenvironment, and dynamically interact with neoplastic cells. However,
our understanding as to the complexity of the T cell response and the factors that drive this response remains
limited. The objective of this proposal is to identify genetic, lifestyle, and tumor factors associated with the T
cell response in CRC, and to characterize the survival implications of that response. Specifically, in Aim 1 we
will examine the relationship of personal characteristics with T cell response in CRC, including the role of (1a)
germline genetic variation within human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor
(KIR) genes, and (1b) lifestyle factors (e.g., aspirin use, smoking, alcohol consumption). In Aim 2 we will focus
on several colorectal tumor characteristics as they relate to T cell response, including (2a) the presence of
Fusobacterium nucleatum and bacterial toxin genes in CRC, and (2b) somatic mutations in key signaling
pathways (e.g., WNT signaling and RAS/RAF). In Aim 3, we will evaluate the associations of different aspects
of T cell response with CRC survival, accounting for known prognostic factors and the relationships identified in
Aims 1-2. To achieve these Aims, we propose to assess the density and spatial distribution of specific T cell
subsets using multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF) to quantify expression levels and co-expression patterns
of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO, and FOXP3 at the single cell level. This multiplexed assessment will allow us to
examine the epidemiologic and prognostic relevance of numerous metrics of T cell response in CRC. This
research will leverage the resources of the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium
(GECCO) and the Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR). GECCO-CCFR is a large collaborative effort
between observational studies of CRC. We have completed genome-wide germline genotyping and have
harmonized epidemiologic data regarding a variety of lifestyle factors and personal characteristics for all
participating studies. We are conducting DNA sequencing with a panel of 205 human genes and a small
number of bacterial genes in CRC tumor tissue. Prospective follow-up for survival is ongoing, and we have
harmonized existing survival data. Through this project, we will add information on T cell response in CRC for
>2,500 CRC cases to the GECCO-CCFR resource. This project provides an unprecedented opportunity to
investigate the epidemiology of the T cell response in CRC and the relationship of that response with personal
and tumor characteristics. Insights gained through this novel study could ultimately inform the development
and targeted implementation of emerging immunotherapeutic and immunopreventative strategies."
10909163,"As life expectancy increases with effective combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), more women with HIV
(WWH) are reaching menopause. WWH experience more frequent and severe vasomotor symptoms (VMS;
the collective term for hot flashes and night sweats) than women without HIV. The menopausal transition is
also associated with increasing risk of aging-related comorbidities such as osteoporosis/fracture,
cardiovascular disease and neurocognitive impairment that disproportionately affect WWH. Menopausal
hormone therapy (HT) is the most effective treatment for VMS; however, utilization is low and HT has never
been studied in WWH. We propose a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 cross-over trial (n=80)
to evaluate the efficacy of HT (transdermal estrogen plus oral progesterone) versus placebo for symptomatic
peri- and early post-menopausal WWH with VMS (Aim 1). We will also compare the effects of HT versus
placebo on neurocognitive function, mood, sleep and quality of life using a battery of assessments that have
been studied specifically in WWH during menopause (Aim 2). HT has noted anti-inflammatory properties;
therefore, we will evaluate the effect of HT on biomarkers of bone and cardiometabolic heath and examine the
role of systemic inflammation (Aim 3). Lastly, we will measure effects of HT on the HIV reservoir using the
Envelope Detection by Induced Transcription-based Sequencing (EDITS) assay, providing prospective
experimental data to validate observational data findings of increased inducible HIV reservoir in WWH after
menopause (Exploratory Aim). Our proposal leverages the resources and infrastructure of the AIDS Clinical
Trials Group (ACTG). Eligibility criteria and endpoints have also been designed to align with MsFLASH
(Menopause Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms and Health Trials) network trials to allow for
future analyses comparing HT response in women with and without HIV. The results of our study will provide
critical information about the role of HT in prevention of aging-related comorbidities and will elucidate whether
systemic inflammation is a modifiable mechanistic pathway. Further, this trial will set the groundwork for future
research comparing HT to non-hormonal therapies for treatment of VMS and prevention of comorbidities in
aging WWH."
10832690,"Abstract
Diagnosing diseases relies heavily on pathologically analyzing tissue samples from patients. For cancers alone,
over 30 million people undergo tissue biopsies annually in the US. While surgery currently represents the best
standard of care treatment to cure invasive cancers, its success depends on timely excision of the tumor before
it can spread. This is especially true for the removal of skin cancers, more common in the populace than all other
malignancies combined, with Mohs surgery deemed the best treatment of choice for its high skin cancer cure
rates. However, this procedure requires the repeated histopathological evaluation of patient tissue samples to
confirmation of cancerous or non-cancerous tissue. This time-consuming step requires freezing, slicing, and
preserving the tissue between microscope slides to take an image, adding 2-3 hours to surgical times. It
increases operative times and the risk of postoperative complications including skin infections, bleeding or
hematoma, wound dehiscence (disruption of recently repaired wounds), tissue necrosis, and pain. The process
is also expensive, requiring ~$70k of equipment to set up, and pricy reagents and highly trained staff to maintain.
There is an unmet need in the market for a cost-effective digital pathology solution to rapidly produce high-quality
images. SurgiVance is developing a confocal-based Surgical Pathology System (SPS) to non-invasively and
rapidly image intact specimens with high resolution. The SPS system uses a novel, patented line-scanning,
stage-scanning confocal microscope. The NIH Phase 1 funded prototype successfully images standard sized
specimens (5 mm x 10 mm) in only 17 seconds, at 1.2 µm lateral resolution and 8.6 µm optical section thickness.
In this Phase II project, SurgiVance has 3 specific aims: 1) Recreate the prototype SPS device in a partner
facility, which will perform design and engineering work to miniaturize the device, reduce its complexity, and
increase its durability for market use, 2) develop AI-based software to rapidly scan and map the surfaces of fresh
samples resected directly from patients, and 3) clinically validate the superior performance of SPS created 3D
digital images of fresh tissue samples in comparison to the standard-of-care histopathology in Mohs patients in
benchmarks established by the SurgiVance FDA Q-Sub Class II, 510(k) pathway to meet beachhead market
needs. This Phase II study will enable SurgiVance to shift the paradigm towards instant, digital 3D pathology,
that when integrated with SurgiVance’s AI-based diagnostics, could enable robust, reproducible, and rapid
automated diagnoses."
10814322,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this project is to develop a novel therapeutic for the treatment of primary
(idiopathic) membranous nephropathy (MN). MN is a leading cause of nephrotic syndrome in
adults and has a variable clinical course. About one third of patients enter spontaneous remission,
whereas the remainder have persistent proteinuria that can lead to end stage renal disease and
even death. In 2009, the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) that is present on podocytes
was identified as the target of autoantibodies in about 70-80% of MN patients. Such
autoantibodies are used as a diagnostic marker for MN, and patients with high PLA2R-specific
antibody levels typically have a poor prognosis.
 Although there are currently several therapies for MN, they can result in general
immunosuppression and other severe side effects. For example, cycles of high dose steroids and
alkylating agents can lead to cancer, osteoporosis and diabetes, and relapses occur in up to 30%
patients within five years following treatment. B cell-depleting antibodies such as rituximab are
also associated with increased risk of infection combined with a significant relapse rate. As a
result of the limitations of existing therapies for MN, there is an unmet need for the development
of improved, selective therapeutic approaches.
 This project seeks to address the need for new therapies for MN by developing engineered,
antibody-based reagents that specifically and rapidly deplete PLA2R-specific antibodies.
Importantly, these depleting agents do not affect the levels of other antibodies that have a
protective role against infection etc. This first-in-class, novel technology has been named Seldeg
technology (for selective degradation).
 The goal of the Phase I project was to provide a proof-of-concept by designing a Seldeg
molecule and showing its suitability for clinical development using in vitro assays. In this Phase II
application, we propose to move the Seldeg forward in the development process by carrying out
the necessary in vitro characterization and studies in animal models. The Specific aims are:
 1. To carry out drug development and testing of the PLA2R-Seldeg using in vitro analyses.
 2. To analyze the in vivo behavior of the PLA2R-Seldeg and targeted autoantibodies.
 The proposed approach could not only be transformative for the management of this
potentially devastating disease, but would also lay the foundations for analogous Seldeg-based
strategies to be taken in many other clinical settings where pathogenic antibodies lead to disease."

This proposal is submitted in direct response to NOT-HD-22-009 Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Innovative
Technologies to Improve Assessments, Interventions, and Outcomes for Individuals with Intellectual and
Developmental Disabilities [IDD] (R43/R44). Persons of all ages with certain metabolic disorders are at-risk for
metabolic crises when a certain metabolite accumulates, while this metabolite can be measured in a clinical
laboratory, currently there is no home-based device to monitor the metabolie that causes the metabolic crises.
 Our team’s long-term goal is to reduce the morbidity and mortality of metabolic crises associated with
certain metabolic accumulation. Through previous and ongoing National Science Foundation and National
Institutes of Health Small Business Innovation Research funding, we have developed an at-home device to
accurately measure this metabolite from a drop of blood and are working towards FDA clearance. The overall
objective of this proposal is to investigate the impact of daily home-based monitoring of the target metabolite
using the device we developed. This will be the first time that at-home measurement of the metabolite will be
measured in the target population at home.
 Our central hypothesis is that when participants measure at-home, fasting, morning metabolite levels
there will be an association between getting an elevated metabolite result and then the patient taking further
action to contacting their medical team to further monitor or take steps to reduce the metabolite level.
 Our specific aims are 1) to perform a clinical trial in 10 participants with disorders resulting in risk of
elevated metabolite levels, 2) to analyze the extensive data collected, and 3) to prepare a manuscript of the
results. To complete our approach we will recruit patients from the available patient population at Oregon
Health & Science University. We will collect extensive data from the participant medical record, observations,
and the device daily metabolite measurements.
 This research is innovative because, for the first time, it provides a straightforward, home-based device
for measurement of the target metabolite. At the conclusion of this project, we expect to understand more the
impact of home-based metabolite monitoring on patient care."
10873828,"Summary/Abstract:
 Single cell gene expression assays have become critical tools for identifying functional subtypes of cells,
as well as changes within specific subtypes resulting from development, disease or therapy treatment. However,
most current methods are expensive, low in sample throughput and rely on oligo-dT primed reverse transcription.
Furthermore, there is no method to-date that enables investigators to consistently measure low expressed genes
from single cells, which prevents measurements of many key biomarkers and important genes and molecular
pathways. Another problem with existing single-cell sequencing methods is that many of the cell-associated
reads either fail to map to transcripts or map to uninformative ribosomal and mitochondrial genes. The
aforementioned limitations have all contributed to most single-cell sequencing studies being restricted to
relatively small numbers of samples and have prevented their wider scale adoption in biopharma, clinical,
translational and applied markets.
 In Phase 1 SBIR development, we implemented a novel combinatorial split-pool-based workflow,
TempO-LINC, that adds cell-identifying molecular barcodes onto high-sensitivity gene expression probes. All
probes within the same cell receive an identical barcode, enabling the reconstruction of single-cell gene
expression (and protein) profiles across tens of thousands of cells. TempO-LINC is an instrument free approach
that multiplexes 96 1,000 cell samples per run, has a simple workflow that is amenable to automation and has
the highest gene detection rate of any commercial single-cell platform. Critically, TempO-LINC reduces both the
per sample assay cost as well as associated sequencing costs; furthermore, although we show the assay
simultaneously profiles the whole transcriptome (23,000 transcripts), it can also be targeted to measure only
genes/pathways of interest – dramatically reducing sequencing costs yet further. All of these features position
TempO-LINC as a potential disruptive technology that researchers, clinicians and drug developers can use for
new large-scale applications/studies using single-cell sequencing across thousands of samples while obtaining
improved data quality.
 Our objective in this Phase 2 proposal is to take the basic TempO-LINC platform that we are currently
running and ready it for commercialization by optimizing the sensitivity, workflow, multi-omic capability and
software. To demonstrate the unique capabilities of TempO-LINC, we will benchmark it against 10X Chromium
data using PBMCs and demonstrate a high-impact application of our technology with our collaborators/partners.
Our approach relies on existing commercial TempO-Seq assays/technology, Phase 1 data that far exceeded all
milestones, and a solid foundation of intellectual property. BioSpyder’s TempO-LINC constitutes a powerful
single-cell platform with high potential for technical success, which will fill a critical need in the marketplace."

animals for chemical toxicity screening,” that is aligned with the needs of the NTP’s Interagency Center for the
Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods (NICEATM) for development and evaluation of new, revised,
and alternative methods to identify potential hazards to human health and the environment.
Through our ongoing NCATS SBIR Phase II, Lena Biosciences (LB) developed and commercialized an organ-
on-a-chip-like, Perfused Organ Panel, with a proprietary liquid breathing technology that provides uniform
interstitial perfusion, superior delivery of oxygen and stable pH to 48 statistically independent organ cultures.
In this project, Lena Biosciences will use the Perfused Organ Panel to develop physiologically-relevant in vitro
screening systems using cells derived from animal species typically utilized for toxicological testing. Next, LB
will replicate biological interactions and toxicological responses observed in animal tissues. Lastly, LB will
produce assay data that is suitable for comparisons between in vitro and in vivo animal toxicology studies, and
Tox21 HTS data. Ultimately, this project will provide thoroughly characterized and validated, alternative in vitro
test systems with high specificity and sensitivity to reduce or replace the use of animals in toxicity testing.
In Phase I, LB will develop biologically and xenobiotic-metabolically competent rodent liver and brain models
having in vivo like cellular respiratory metabolism to achieve optimal mitochondrial responsiveness and
susceptibility to toxicants. The liver model will provide high activity of drug metabolizing enzymes for in situ
generation of reactive metabolites, and mimic parallel processes of parent drug deletion and metabolite
formation to better model and predict toxicological outcomes. The brain model(s) will mimic the brain’s innate
immunity with robust toxicological responses to drug overdose, Acetylcholinesterase inhibition with acute
neurotoxicity (Phase I), and neuropathy target esterase inhibition that cause delayed neuropathy (Phase II)
following the exposure to organophosphorus (OP) chemicals and their toxic metabolites.
Perfused Organ Panel and 3 sets of in vitro controls will be treated with Acetaminophen (APAP) and Malathion,
an OP insecticide with a neurotoxic metabolite, Malaoxon, that are relevant to the testing of specific tissue
models and for which species-matched in vivo data already exists. This will facilitate benchmarking and show

10798170,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in women in the United States and the most commonly
occurring cancer worldwide according to the World Health Organization. The primary screening method for
non-palpable breast cancers is X-ray mammography, which uses ionizing radiation and often has low
sensitivity and specificity in dense breasts. Ultrasound tomography offers a low-cost alternative to X-ray
mammography that can image the breast based on its acoustic properties and enable early cancer detection
and diagnosis, while avoiding the potentially harmful effects of ionizing radiation. Currently, ultrasound
tomography of the breast generally relies primarily on the transmission of ultrasound through the tissue to
reconstruct underlying tissue properties such as sound speed and attenuation. However, a significant gap in
our knowledge is the simultaneous modeling of signals transmitted through the tissue and signals reflected
from the tissue to estimate these tissue properties. Combining transmission and reflection information from an
ultrasound tomography system will enable accurate estimation of difficult-to-measure tissue properties such as
the mass density. Furthermore, the addition of reflection information may enable tissue characterization in
acoustically challenging cases where transmission information is less reliable (e.g., transmission through bone,
partial angle tomography). I propose to improve the robustness of ultrasound transmission tomography
by incorporating reflection information and enable the estimation of mass density.
 In order to expand the capabilities of the ultrasound tomography system I aim to: extend transmission
tomography to three dimension in order account for out-of-plane scattering (Aim 1); develop algorithms to
simultaneously reconstruct the sound speed, acoustic attenuation, and mass density of tissue using the
complete transmission and reflection information acquired by an ultrasound tomography system (Aim 2); and
develop sound speed reconstruction algorithms solely based on the reflected ultrasound signal, which will also
benefit the applications of handheld pulse-echo ultrasound (Aim 3). These aims will improve our understanding
of acoustic models applicable to ultrasound signals in both transmission and reflection as well as how these
models may be inverted to reconstruct accurate and spatially resolved images of tissue properties. Expanding
the tissue characterization capabilities of ultrasound tomography will enable a multi-parametric approach for
the detection and characterization of breast cancer using a non-ionizing radiation imaging modality. Improving
the robustness of ultrasound tomography in acoustically challenging cases will also enable cancer detection
outside of the breast and may further enable detection of breast cancer metastasis. The proposed work will
broadly benefit the ultrasound imaging field by improving our tissue modeling and characterization capabilities
and enabling the early detection of disease based on acoustic tissue properties."

SUMMARY
 The objective of our SCORE on “Sex Differences in Cardiometabolic Health and Disease” is to identify
factors that determine sex-specific cardiometabolic disease risk, which may lead to better diagnosis and
treatment for both sexes. A unique feature of our program is the investigation of sex differences from multiple
perspectives, including effects of estrogen, of XX vs. XY sex chromosome genes, and of genetic variation
among individuals. Our program consists of three research projects and three cores, and will use preclinical
mouse models, human induced pluripotent stem cell lines (iPSCs), and existing human population datasets
(genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic) to translate findings from our model systems to
humans. Project 1, “Epigenetic sex determinants of cardiometabolic disease and prevention,” will build on our
identification of X and Y chromosome genes that influence sex differences in both the development of diet-
induced obesity and susceptibility to adverse effects of statin drugs. We will elucidate the role of three X-Y
histone demethylase genes in epigenetic sex differences in mouse adiposity and human adipocyte
differentiation. We will also identify the epigenetic determinants of sex-biased statin adverse effects on
mitochondrial function. Project 2, “Gene-by-sex interactions in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
(HFpEF),” seeks to understand the mechanisms underlying increased prevalence of HFpEF in women
compared to men. Using a “systems genetics” approach and a panel of genetically distinct mouse strains, the
goals are to understand sex differences in HFpEF traits at the molecular level, including the role of gonadal
hormones and sex chromosomes, and to create sex-specific biologic networks that can be generalized to
humans. Recent findings implicate sex differences in the mitochondrial enzyme, ACSL6, as causal for HFpEF,
and further studies will characterize the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in HFpEF. Project 3, “The impact of
estrogen receptor alpha on cardiomyocellular metabolism and health,” will test the hypothesis that estrogen
receptor alpha action in cardiomyocytes impacts mitochondrial metabolism, cardiac tissue integrity and heart
function. Findings with unique cardiomyocyte estrogen receptor alpha knockout or overexpression mouse
models will then be integrated with human data in collaboration with our Human Translational Bioinformatics
Core. The Human Translational Bioinformatics Core will serve as hub for computational analyses to
translate findings from the three Projects for association and relevant to cardiometabolic traits in humans using
existing large human genetic and –omics datasets. The Career Enhancement Core will foster research in sex
differences in metabolism by administering a Pilot & Feasibility grant program, and will educate researchers
and students about SABV through courses, hands-on laboratory ‘bootcamp,’ and a library of SABV videos. The
Administrative Core will ensure effective leadership and management of this SCORE."
10919841,"PROJECT 1: Epigenetic Sex Differences in Cardiometabolic Disease and Prevention
SUMMARY
Sex impacts the development of obesity and related cardiometabolic disorders. Sex also influences adverse
responses to statin drugs, which are widely prescribed to prevent cardiovascular disease. We have identified
genes on the sex chromosomes (X and Y) that have differential expression levels between males and females
and influence both adiposity and adverse effects of statin drugs. The sex chromosome genes Kdm5c, Kdm6a,
and Kdm5d encode histone demethylase enzymes, which regulate methyl marks on histone tails to modulate
transcription factor access to gene promoters and enhancers. We hypothesize that gene dosage of X and Y
chromosome histone demethylases impacts sex differences in cardiometabolic health by epigenetic
regulation of gene expression. We will define the mechanisms by which sex-specific gene dosage of these
enzymes influence adipose tissue biology and statin induced mitochondrial dysfunction. The goal of Aim1 is to
elucidate epigenetic sex differences in mouse adiposity and human adipocyte differentiation. We will
determine physiological and molecular effects of Kdm5c, Kdm6a and Kdm5d gene dosage on sex differences in
adiposity and adipocyte differentiation using mouse models, multi-omics analyses, and human induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. Specific objective include: determining the physiological mechanisms by which
Kdm6a influences adiposity exclusively in females, and Kdm5d influences adiposity exclusively in males;
identifying the genomic targets of KDM5C, KDM6A, and KDM5D in adipocytes by characterizing the
transcriptome, chromatin landscape, histone methylation, and histone demethylase genomic binding sites; and
identifying sex differences in human male and female preadipocyte differentiation and epigenetic landscape
using a unique resource of several dozen human iPS cell lines. The goal of Aim 2 is to evaluate epigenetic
determinants of sex-biased statin adverse effects. We will utilize human iPSCs from women with and without
statin new-onset diabetes to assess the role of KDM5 histone demethylase activity in statin-induced
mitochondrial dysfunction, and to identify transcriptomic and epigenomic modifications in statin-treated iPSCs
from women with or without statin new onset diabetes and mitochondrial dysfunction. These studies address the
understudied area of sex differences in adverse effects of widely prescribed drugs. We will translate our findings
on fundamental mechanisms underlying sex differences in cardiometabolic traits to humans through analysis of
extensive existing human genetic and –omics data, in collaboration with our Human Translational Bioinformatics
Core."
10919842,"Project 2: Gene-by-sex interactions in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)
PROJECT SUMMARY
Our laboratory has been interested in the basis of sex differences in cardiometabolic traits for the past two
decades. We use a “system genetics” approach that integrates clinical and molecular traits in the context of
genetic variation. For studies in mice we use a resource called the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP) that
has a number of advantages for studies of complex traits. Our proposal is fucused on a poorly understood, but
common form of heart failure, called heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). It is characterized
by diastolic dysfunction and preserved ejection fraction, distinct from heart failure with reduced ejection fraction
(HFrEF). HFpEF is a highly complex disorder with multiple comorbidities, including obesity, diabetes,
hypertension, and inflammation. It is highly heterogenous and has a significant environmental component,
making human studies difficult. Consistent epidemiological data demonstrate that women are about twice as
likely to develop HFpEF as compared to men. They also tend to present with more symptom burden, including
signiﬁcantly increased diastolic dysfunction and enhanced left ventricle stiffness. However, the nature of sex
differences remains unclear. Because of the complexity of the syndrome, we have used a mouse model of
HFpEF that involves feeding mice a high fat diet and a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. Our strategy is to perform
systems genetics analyses using this model in the HMDP and from this develop hypotheses that can be tested
in human cohorts. Our results thus far in mice have revealed that females tend to be more susceptible to diastolic
dysfunction and other HFpEF traits than males, consistent with the human epidemiological data. Aim 1 is
directed at understanding sex differences in HFpEF traits, particularly in the heart, at the molecular level. A long-
term goal is to model sex-specific biologic networks that can be generalized to humans. Aim 2 is directed at
understanding the cause of the sex differences. We have previously obtained evidence that sex hormones
explain, in part, the sex differences in HFpEF susceptibility and we now propose to examine sex chromosomes
using the Four Core Genotypes (FCG). During the course of our studies, we discovered that, in heart, males
have higher levels of mitochondrial function than do females, and we have proposed that this may explain the
sex difference. In Aim 3, we will now test this hypothesis by examining the roles of estrogen receptor alpha and
sex chromosomes in mitochondrial functions. We will also characterize in detail the mitochondrial enzyme,
ACSL6, that we have identified as causal for HFpEF."
10919844,"Project 3: The impact of estrogen receptor alpha on cardiomyocellular metabolism and health
ABSTRACT Inactivating mutations and reductions in ESR1 (encodes ERα) are associated with
cardiometabolic disease risk in women and men. Moreover, the menopausal transition drives reduction of
cardiometabolic health and increased heart failure incidence. However, the causal mechanisms underlying
heart failure risk in women during this life phase, and the specific cell types impacted by impairment in
estrogen action are inadequately defined. Since aspects of cardiometabolic decline including insulin
resistance, obesity, and cardiac dysfunction are recapitulated in ERα null mice, our laboratory has
subsequently performed a tissue dissection approach to understand the cell-specific impact of ERα action
on metabolism and tissue function. In this proposal we focused specifically on the role of ERα on cardiac
function. A primary limitation regarding previous reports of estradiol action in cardiac tissue is the lack of
specificity in the manipulation of ERα in cardiomyocytes in vivo. To overcome this limitation, we are the
first laboratory to generate mice with a conditional cardiomyocellular-specific knockdown (hERαKD) or
overexpression (hERαOE) of Esr1. In Aim 1 of this proposal we will determine the impact of hERαKD on
mitochondrial metabolism, cardiac tissue integrity, and heart function. We hypothesize that
cardiomyocellular knockdown of Esr1 disrupts mitochondrial metabolism contributing to pathogenic shifts
in substrate metabolism, inflammation, fibrosis, and susceptibility to the damaging effects of cardiotoxic
agents (e.g. Doxorubicin). In Aim 2 we will determine the impact of conditional cardiomyocellular-specific
overexpression of Esr1, hERαOE, on mitochondrial metabolism, cardiac tissue integrity, and protection
against high fat diet feeding and cardiotoxic agents. Importantly, phenotypic outcomes in these mouse
models, integrated with findings in human subjects, will allow us to ascertain the ERα-regulated
transcriptome in heart and establish mechanisms of ERα control over novel target genes. The overarching
goal of our work is to determine the impact of impaired estrogen receptor action in the pathobiology of
heart failure and identify targets of therapeutic opportunity to protect women against cardiometabolic
disease."
10925282,"ABSTRACT – PROJECT 2
PARP inhibitors have emerged as an established standard of care option in epithelial ovarian cancer (OvCa).
Approximately half of OvCa patients harbor inactivating genetic alterations in the homologous recombination
(HR) pathway, which results in synthetic lethality with PARP inhibition (PARPi). PARPi have promising activity
in HR-deficient OvCa. Even though less effective compared to HR-deficient OvCa, PARPis have also been
shown to be active in HR-proficient OvCa. Unfortunately, the activity of PARPi is limited by the emergence of
PARPi resistance. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify potential strategies to reverse PARPi resistance
in OvCa. Our preliminary studies suggest that inhibition of BRD4 activity by bromodomain extraterminal inhibitors
(BETi) is an attractive approach to reverse PARPi resistance. Notably, the BRD4 genomic locus 19p13.12 is
often amplified in high-grade serous OvCa (~20%). Indeed, BRD4 amplification/overexpression correlates with
a poor prognosis in these patients.
We and others have shown that BETis play a major role in suppressing the HR pathway and impairing the G2/M
checkpoint, which reverses resistance to PARPi caused by restoration of the HR pathway. Therefore, our
central hypothesis is that targeting BRD4 activity using clinically applicable BET inhibitor is sufficient
to overcome resistance to PARPi developed in recurrent OvCa. We also hypothesize that targeting BRD4
will sensitize tumor to PARPi by simultaneously downregulating HR activity, specifically BRCA1, RAD51 and
TOPBP1 expression, and impairing the G2/M phase of the cell cycle by suppressing WEE1 activity, leading to
DNA damage accumulation and mitotic catastrophe. Accordingly, the objective of the present study is to
evaluate the safety and efficacy of a combination of PARPi and BETi in recurrent PARPi-resistant
platinum-sensitive OvCa. We also plan to assess the impact of PARPi-BETi combination on functional HR
activity and percent reduction compared to baseline and correlate with objective response to therapy. Further,
we plan to investigate the mechanistic basis of these findings in patient-derived models obtained from the
patients enrolled in the trial. To achieve that, we propose the following specific aims (SA): SA1. To determine
the safety and efficacy of PARPi combined with BETi in patients with recurrent PARPi-resistant OvCa in a phase
Ib clinical trial. SA2. To investigate the impact of the combined regimen on modulating HR and DNA damage
response (DDR) pathways as well as G2-M cell cycle checkpoint using tissue and circulating tumor DNA samples
both at baseline, on treatment and at time of progression. SA3: To investigate the mechanisms of response and
resistance to the combination regimen in preclinical models. The potential impact is significant as there is an
urgent need to overcome resistance to PARPi in OvCa. This project investigates a novel new therapeutic
direction combining PARPi with epigenetic therapy by BETi. PARPi resistance is a major challenge given that
PARPi are now approved in first line and recurrent settings. Further, this study will investigate predictive
biomarkers, which will help identify patients who benefit from this regimen. Successful execution of this study
will provide a rationale to advance this regimen into scientifically rationalized trials focused on improving the
outcome of this most lethal cancer with limited treatment options."
10925287,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – PROJECT 3
When effective, immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy can significantly improve the outcome of patients with
ovarian cancer (OvCa). However, only 10-20% of OvCa patients respond to ICI therapy. One reason for the low
ICI response rate of OvCa may be OvCa’s unique immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which is
typified by a dense stroma infiltrated by immunosuppressive ‘M2’ tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). We
recently found that ovarian carcinoma-associated mesenchymal stem cells (CA-MSC) orchestrate an
immunosuppressive OvCa TME; differentiating into BIGH3 expressing fibroblast/tumor stroma, recruiting
monocytes to the stroma, and promoting the differentiation of immunosuppressive BIGH3 expressing ‘M2’ TAMs.
The combined effect is that CA-MSC drive tumor immune exclusion and a resultant resistance to ICI
therapy. Importantly, we find that hedgehog inhibitors (HHi) reverse CA-MSC-driven immune exclusion,
promote M2 to M1 TAM conversion, and restore response to ICI therapy. HHi therapy down-regulates
BIGH3 in CA-MSC and TAMs, and promotes the conversion of TAMs from an M2 to and M1 phenotype. Our
studies are consistent with numerous recent reports that HHi promote M1 macrophage polarization and promote
anti-tumor immunity. Based on these results, we hypothesize that CA-MSC create an immunosuppressive OvCa
TME and that HHi will reverse CA-MSC mediated immune-suppression and enhance patient response to ICI
therapy. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: SA1. Conduct a single arm Phase-II
clinical trial evaluating Atezolizumab (aPD-L1) combined with Vismodegib (HHi) in patients with platinum
resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. Primary endpoints will be efficacy and safety. Secondary endpoints will be
duration of response, PFS, OS and translational correlatives. SA2: Evaluate the impact of HHi on patients’
tumor immune infiltrates and peripheral chemokines and determine if changes predict response to therapy.
SA3: To assess BIGH3 as a driver of tumor immune exclusion and immunotherapeutic target. Using
murine models of OvCa, we will assess the impact of BIGH3 on immune effector migration and function and
determine if anti-BIGH3 therapy can enhance ICI response in murine tumor models.
IMPACT: This will be the first clinical trial in OvCa to determine (i) the impact of HHi on ICI therapy in patients
with epithelial cancer, and (ii) the role of targeting CA-MSCs to overcome the immunosuppressive OvCa TME.
Correlative translational studies will reveal potential predictive biomarkers of response to therapy. Finally, we
will evaluate BIGH3 as an immune regulator and novel therapeutic target. Ultimately, we believe these studies
will impact OvCa patient’s response to ICI therapy and will improve outcomes."
10925291,"PROJECT SUMMARY – TRANSLATIONAL PATHOLOGY CORE
The high case-fatality of ovarian cancer makes translational studies essential for advancing treatment and
improving outcomes. The Hillman Cancer Center (HCC) Ovarian Cancer (OvCa) SPORE Translational
Pathology Core (TPC) will provide four key services to facilitate innovative translational studies: (1) procuring
quality-controlled, pathology-reviewed, and clinically-annotated biospecimens, (2) extracting, processing, and
storing de-identified clinical data that can be easily integrated with other data types (e.g., genotype, omics,
metadata), (3) securely sharing biospecimens and data, and (4) developing patient-derived tumor models for
therapeutic and mechanistic studies. The TPC provides these critical services to HCC OvCa SPORE
investigators, other NCI-funded OvCa SPOREs, and the greater OvCa research community. A strength of the
TPC is the OvCa SPORE Biorepository, established as a part of a previous P50 award to support the
translational needs of OvCa researchers. The biorepository enables all persons seen at HCC gynecologic
cancer clinics in southwestern PA to donate samples. Consented individuals provide tumor, ascites, pelvic
washes, blood, stool, and/or tissue samples for fresh or preserved disbursement. Specimens are longitudinally
collected to include samples prior to treatment, throughout the course of clinical care, and at project-specific
timepoints. All specimens undergo central pathology review. A novel aspect of the TPC is using primary patient
tissues to generate preclinical models to facilitate basic science and preclinical studies. TPC banks single live
cell tumor suspensions, isolates and expands primary patient tumor-derived cancer-associated mesenchymal
stem cells, and creates mixed cell culture tumor organoids. Primary tumor is also used to generate patient-
derived tumor xenografts (PDX) including a new humanized stroma PDX (HS-PDX). HS-PDX can be
generated in mice with humanized bone marrow to include a human immune system. TPC will ensure that all
samples it collects are accompanied by annotations that will permit linking laboratory analyses with clinical
results. Data and annotations will be stored in the OvCa SPORE database and will be updated and retrieved
for research projects following established HIPAA protocols. The TPC draws on resources already available
through HCC, including the Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) cores and the Magee-Womens Research
Institute and Foundation (MWRI). As such it efficiently and effectively provides and facilitates the testing of
clinically derived data and biospecimens to support OvCa SPORE investigators, and the greater ovarian
cancer research community, ultimately improving the lives of patients suffering from this devastating disease."

pathways as candidates for potential drug targets for promoting human healthspan, the focus of the renewal
application will be to expand the program through whole exome analysis of our own and other, additional genetic
resources, further gene functionalization, developing additional mouse models and expanding our pipeline of
candidate interventions. To accomplish these goals, we propose an interdisciplinary approach, making full use

For this U19 Program Project, we will establish a Data Integration and Sharing (DIS) Core to process and analyze
the large amount of data that will be generated by its four research projects. This U19 proposes an integrated
study to test a new approach for developing therapies for age-related diseases. Rather than focusing on
individual diseases, we explore genetic differences between successfully aged, healthy centenarians and control
individuals with no family history of extreme longevity. Our long-term goal is to use gene variants found enriched
in the centenarian genome as potential targets for developing drugs that prevent, delay onset and progression,
and possibly even revert many of the multiple age-related diseases. The overall objective of the DIS core is to
provide a computational and statistical platform to the project investigators for analyzing and sharing their data
in concert, thereby achieving the aims of the U19 project grant. The central hypothesis of this U19 is that
centenarians harbor protective genotypes of rare variants in conserved aging pathways, which can be used to
identify novel drug targets as the basis for subsequent development of therapeutics against multiple age-related
diseases and to ultimately increase human healthspan. This hypothesis has been formulated based on a large
body of data already produced in this U19. The rationale for a dedicated core to that purpose is that a
consolidated facility is needed to manage the large amount of data on the whole genome level generated by
each of four highly integrated projects of this U19. This DIS Core will be established to achieve three specific
aims: 1) To assist projects in processing and analyzing the data that they generate; 2) To integrate project data
at the systems level and identify genetic network of pro-longevity drug targets; 3) To develop a web portal to
warehouse and share data generated by the projects. The function of the DIS Core is significant, because it will
be set up to meet the challenge posed by the high volume of data that need to be generated, examined at
multiple levels by a variety of approaches, integrated to develop the models for lifespan control, and shared
among project investigators and the scientific community at large."

10935993,"Project Summary
RNA editing of cellular RNAs helps the cell distinguish between self and non-self RNAs. This
editing of adenosines into inosines is generally catalyzed by the `adenosine deaminase acting on
RNA-1' protein (ADAR1). A>I editing is augmented in tumors and upon infection, primarily
through the interferon-induced longer isoform of ADAR1 that comprises a Z-DNA/Z-RNA binding
domain named ‘Zα’ at its N-terminus. Misediting is implicated in neurological diseases such as
Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. Z-RNA in the form of repeats of cytosine and guanosine (CpG) in a
left-handed double-helical conformation has been proposed in cells, but the prevalence of such
structures and their exact role are unknown. In addition, many —if not most— regions proposed
to adopt a Z conformation do not resemble regular (CpG)n. How these local Z-RNA conformations
are generated within A-form helices, stabilized and regulated by Zα of ADAR1, as well as their
exact role in the function of these RNAs, remain unknown. Our hypothesis is that the binding
of Zα to Z-RNA plays an essential role during the editing process. Here, we propose to
answer the following questions: What is the mechanism for Z-RNA formation at CpG but also
non-CpG sequences? How widespread are transitions to Z-RNA across transcriptomes? Is Z-
RNA sampled in the free form or only adopted upon binding by Zα? What are the structural
features of Z-RNA recognition by Zα at non CpG sequences? We will first dynamically
characterize the propensity of various sequence contexts to adopt Z-RNA conformations.
This aim will use advanced NMR methods to characterize the sequence of events that lead an
RNA region from A-form to Z-form. Second, we will determine the unbiased 3D structure of
RNA fragments bound to Zα in solution. Finally, we will identify and localize Zα binding
sites and Zα-dependent A>I editing events. This aim will take advantage of the robust
expertise and support for next-generation sequencing on our campus and at a contracted
company. Overall, our joint work as co-PIs will provide a structural rationale for the formation of
Z-RNA and the resulting formation of A-Z junctions across a variety of RNAs. We ultimately aim
to explain how the Z-RNA binding domain of ADAR1 increases the specificity and activity of
ADAR1. Our findings will help beyond this application with proposing a comprehensive
mechanism for ADAR1 editing and its RNA-mediated transcriptome-wide regulation, and
contribute to understanding disease such as cancer or auto-immune deficiencies."
10915002,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Transcriptional and chromatin dysregulation are hallmarks of cancer. In this project, we functionally characterize
alterations in the pioneer transcription factor, called FOXA1, that are highly recurrent in hormone-receptor driven
cancers and describe an innovative chromatin-based approach to identify and therapeutically target
transcriptional pathways that specify cellular identity in cancer. FOXA1 de-compacts chromatin to enable binding
of the androgen receptor (AR) to activate the PCa genes. By leveraging an aggregate PCa cohort with 1546
samples, we define three novel structural classes of FOXA1 alterations that notably diverge in clinical incidence,
genomic co-alterations, and pathogenic gain-of-functions. Notably, these three alteration classes collectively
recur in over 35% of the cases, making FOXA1 the third most-highly altered oncogene in metastatic PCa. Class1
mutations originate in primary PCa without ETS-fusions or SPOP mutations, alter the Wing2 secondary structure
within the DNA-binding domain, enable faster nuclear mobility, and strongly activate the AR program of prostate
oncogenesis. Contrastingly, class2 mutations are acquired in the metastatic disease, truncate the C-terminal
regulatory domain, enable dominant binding to the chromatin, and activate the WNT program of metastasis.
Finally, class3 structural variations are enriched in metastatic PCa, cluster within the FOXA1 topological domain,
and duplicate the highly conserved enhancer element that drives overexpression of FOXA1. In the F99 phase, I
propose to mechanistically elucidate the neomorphic activation of WNT-signaling by the FOXA1 class2 mutants.
I hypothesize the C-terminal domain of WT FOXA1 to recruit WNT-repressive cofactors to the chromatin, and
thus the C-terminal truncated class2 mutants that dominantly bind to the chromatin to transcriptionally de-repress
WNT-signaling. This hypothesis offers a unique opportunity to uncover a novel association between FOXA1 and
WNT transcriptional pathways. In the K00 phase, I aim to address the intriguing question of why driver oncogenes
are not universally shared across cancer types. As a likely explanation, I postulate the existence of requisite
interactions between oncogenic pathways and lineage-specific epigenetic/chromatin architecture in driving the
malignant phenotype, akin to FOXA1 or ERG (oncogenes) and AR (lineage-essential gene) in primary PCa. This
presents the opportunity of disrupting these essential, lineage-defining pathways in cancer as a promising
therapeutic strategy - a concept termed as “targeting the cancer cell identity.” Overall, our findings till date
substantiate FOXA1 as a principal oncogene and a viable therapeutic target in PCa. In the future, I propose to
delineate the molecular mechanism of aberrant WNT activation in FOXA1 class2-mutant tumors and propose a
novel therapeutic strategy of disrupting the cancer cell identity to improve patient survival. These findings will be
presented at research conferences where I can meet with potential K00 mentors, and described in peer-reviewed
scientific publications. Training in such a multi-disciplinary environment will provide the foundational knowledge
and the essential skills for me to succeed as an independent translational cancer researcher in academia."
10886737,"We hypothesize that new biomarkers to refine selecting men for prostate biopsy, together with imaging
innovations to refine biopsy targeting, will enhance prostate cancer early detection by reducing unnecessary
biopsy and over-detection of indolent disease. With this goal, we assembled biospecimen and imaging data via
rigorous SOP's in pre-biopsy cohorts designed to avoid bias. We provided specimens and guidance on PRoBE
adherence to EDRN Labs, NIH Consortia (eg SPOREs) and industry and co-led, in prior cycles, EDRN studies
that facilitated FDA approval of the Prostate Health Index (phi) and urinary PCA3. In the current cycle, we
enrolled 3,263 subjects and distributed 27,072 biospecimens to 25 PI's leading to 56 publications. Our multi-
center phase III validation of an algorithm combining urinary PCA3 and TMPRSS2:Erg (T2:Erg) measurement
validated the cost-effectiveness of this biomarker combination. We then showed significant benefit of
sequentially testing blood phi followed by conditional urine PCA3 and T2:Erg testing. Further, we partnered
with a commercial collaborator having expertise in bringing tissue RNA assays to regulatory approval and
clinical use, to complete whole transcriptome urinary RNA expression analysis in a multi-center case-control
cohort of 587 men, resolving a 33-gene predictive model that significantly improved prediction of aggressive
prostate cancer compared to PSA, clinical factors, or urinary PCA3 and T2:Erg. To advance prostate cancer
imaging, we completed a phase II validation study using the radiotracer fluciclovine (FACBC) in PET-CT to
characterize aggressiveness of prostate cancer at initial diagnosis (to our knowledge, this was first completed
American validation study of FACBC PET-CT for primary, untreated, early stage prostate cancer). For this
renewal, we expand our inclusiveness by adding UAB and UTSW (which, with Emory, enrolled the majority of
African-Americans in EDRN's Prostate MRI trial). For this resubmission, two biomedical engineering
investigators expert in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have joined our CVC, who bring preliminary data supporting a
rigorously developed, retrospectively validated deep-learning MRI AI nomogram to predict PCa on biopsy that
is poised for prospective validation. Based on the combined preliminary data in urinary RNA biomarkers, MRI
AI, and PET imaging from our expanded CVC team, we now propose the following Aims: 1) To validate, by
nested case-control study using PROBE design, the performance of a 33-gene urinary RNA panel in predicting
aggressive prostate cancer on biopsy; 2) To validate a deep learning-based nomogram using MRI AI to predict
aggressive prostate cancer on biopsy 3) To evaluate the performance of PET-MRI in the detection of clinically
significant prostate cancer; 4) To conduct, with CISNET, cost-effectiveness evaluation of the impact of these
new biomarker, imaging and detection techniques. Finally, we commit to continuing to serve as a Collaborative
Resource for the EDRN, through leadership and participation in Set-Aside and Core Collaborative Studies and
provision of biospecimens and blinded clinical data to EDRN BCC's and other collaborating biomarker labs."
10903923,"Chemokines and their G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are key mediators of intercellular
signaling between cancer cells and multiple stromal cell types. Cancer cell proliferation, local
invasion, systemic metastasis, recruitment of immune cells and angiogenesis all are regulated by
spatial and temporal dynamics of chemokines. The central role of chemokines in tumor biology
has made them an attractive target for therapies designed to inhibit or enhance chemokine
signaling. However, much of the complex biochemistry of chemokines remains to be discovered,
due to the technical challenges of tracing their presence and function in living systems.
Chemokines are effective at signaling at very low levels, and their spatial distribution is complex
due to their ability to bind to cell surfaces and extracellular matrix. Furthermore, internalization of
chemokines by GPCRs and scavenger receptors shape local chemokine gradients by
sequestering and degrading chemokines. Experimental evidence and computational modeling by
our lab show that short-range, steep local gradients of chemokine CXCL12 over distances of a
single cell most effectively drive signaling and chemotaxis through receptor CXCR4. To enable
transformative studies of chemokines and ultimately advance applications of drugs targeting
chemokines in cancer, we propose to develop a new suite of quantitative molecular imaging tools
to measure the spatial and temporal dynamics of chemokine distribution, association, and
signaling in hundreds of single cells. These tools will allow us to measure cell signaling patterns
during chemotaxis and identify potential mechanisms underlying intercellular heterogeneity in
responses to chemokines. We will 1) Generate an integrated, multiplexed bioluminescence and
fluorescence microscopy toolbox for single-cell imaging of extracellular and intracellular steps in
chemokine signaling; and 2) Test our chemokine imaging technology as a generalizable,
quantitative approach applicable to patient-derived cells. We will uniquely combine dynamic,
single-cell bioluminescence and fluorescence microscopies technologies to measure numerous
molecular events cells use to convert chemokine inputs into signaling outputs and chemotaxis.
We will couple our multiplexed imaging readouts with advanced image processing methods to
generate high-dimensional quantitative data sets needed for basic studies of chemokines and
integration with other large-scale data. Our innovative imaging tools will allow an unprecedented
view of chemokine gradients and heterogeneity of cellular responses in complex environments.
This technology will transform investigations of chemokines in cancer and advance ongoing
efforts to target chemokines for therapy."
10909077,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Considerable data now suggests that inflammatory processes play a critical role in the pathogenesis of diabetic
retinopathy. Leukocytes in particular appear to play a major role in the diabetes-induced degeneration of retinal
capillaries (which sets up the conditions for eventual development of retinal ischemia, release of vaso-
proliferative factors like VEGF, and ultimately, retinal neovascularization). How leukocytes mediate this
capillary cell damage in diabetes is not known.
Neutrophils contain large quantities of proteases, which they use to kill foreign invaders in the body.
Neutrophils are known to release neutrophil elastase (NE) as a part of their response to injury, but failure to
regulate their levels can result in tissue injury. We present evidence that neutrophil elastase plays and
important role in the endothelial damage and cytotoxicity in diabetes, and postulate that the diabetes-induced
induction of retinal inflammation and the vascular damage that is characteristic of early diabetic retinopathy are
secondary to neutrophils via transport of NE in extracellular vesicles to endothelial cells, where the NE cleaves
Gasdermin D (GSDMD) to cause cytotoxic pores in the endothelial cell membranes.
We propose 3 specific aims:
Aim 1. To investigate the effect of pharmacologic inhibition of NE on early stages of diabetic retinopathy. We
will use structurally NE inhibitors, and will administer the therapies systemically as well as via eyedrops.
Aim 2. To investigate mechanism(s) by which NE increases death of retinal endothelial cells in diabetes.
Aim 3. Investigate the role of GSDMD in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. These studies will be
conducted initially using GSDMD-/- mice.
These studies will be conducted in vivo using pharmacological means to inhibit NE in diabetes and using mice
genetically deficient in GSDMD. This proposal is novel because it focuses on (i) the role of a neutrophil
protease in the pathogenesis of the retinopathy, and (ii) toxicity to retinal endothelial cells as a result of transfer
of the protease from neutrophils to the endothelial cells via extracellular vesicles. This area is new and has not
been previously been studied with respect to diabetic retinopathy. The insights learned from these studies can
lead to development of novel and effective therapies that inhibit the development of diabetic retinopathy by
targeting a protease secreted by neutrophils or the subsequent cleavage of GSDMD."
10896200,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this proposal is investigation of the mechanism of ZBP1-mediated response to LPS and protection
from bacterial infection that is provided by ZBP1. Our published and preliminary data characterize a novel
noncanonical activation fo Caspase 8 in response to LPS, which results in the pyroptotic cell death in
macrophages. In further inquiry, we identified that containing CASP8 pro-death complex II that assembles in
response to LPS, is not dependent on TNFR1 as was widely accepted so far, but rather on TRIF thus making
TRIF a central component of theis activation pathway. To reflect the requirement for TRIF in complex II
formation and activation of CASP8, we termed this new pyroptosis-inducing complex the “TRIFosome”. In
further mechanistic inquiry, we found that the nucleic acid sensor, ZBP1, which thus far has been implicated
only in viral infections, plays a significant role in the formation of the TRIFosome complex by shuttling RIPK1 to
TRIF. The reliance of Complex II formation on ZBP1 raised a question whether ZBP1 mediates inflammatory
responses to LPS as well. In support of this hypothesis, our preliminary data show that ZBP1 mediates LPS-
induced inflammatory responses, thus providing rationale for further in vivo investigations of the role that ZBP1
might play in responses to LPS and Yersinia infection. To address whether ZBP1-mediated response to LPS
provides protection from the bacterial infection, we propose 2 aims. In Aim 1, we will investigate ZBP1-
mediated in vitro response to LPS using double knockout and gene-silencing approach. We will use ZBP1-
specific immunoprecipitation in order to determine the components of ZBP1-interactome. determine the
contribution of ZBP1 to LPS-induced immune response, which will include elucidation specific role of ZBP1 in
mediating TRIF-dependent and TRIF-independent responses. It will also include delineation of the role of
ZBP1 in the RIPK1-specific response to LPS. including understanding the roles of the functional domains of
ZBP1 in this pathway, analysis of the recruitment of ZBP1 into the endosomal TRIFosome complex, and
characterization of the ZBP1-dependent changes in host response to bacterial infection in vivo. In the second
Aim, we will capitalize on our preliminary findings and will further investigate how the kinetics of response to
LSP that is conferred by ZBP1 confers sensitivity to LPS-induced tosicity I vivo, and whether this sensitivity
provides protection from gram-negative infection in vivo. These studies will help establishing the role of ZBP1
in host response to bacterial infection and will position ZBP1 at the crosstalk of different immune response
pathways."
10846661,"Abstract:
Glaucoma is one of a number of optic nerve diseases which lead to retinal ganglion cells (RGC)
degeneration, ultimately manifesting in a functional loss of vision if left untreated. There exist a number
of therapeutic approaches to treat these conditions, but there are currently no clinical methods to
detect the onset of RGC dysfunction. The Pattern Electroretinogram (PERG) is the only established tool
to monitor RGC health in vivo in humans and experimental models of optic nerve diseases. The
monitoring of PERG responses can potentially provide earlier detection of degenerative retinal disorders
such as glaucoma, allowing for treatment paradigms to be initiated before irreversible functional vision
loss has occurred. A critical barrier to the widespread adoption of PERG for research and clinical use
involves suboptimal characteristics of conventionally available displays for eliciting visual responses. The
goal of the proposed project is to produce commercially available device for use in both vision research
and clinical applications, which is not only more compact, faster, cheaper and more user‐friendly, but
also provides a higher quality of information through innovative display technology and processing
techniques. As part of our Phase I efforts, we developed a miniaturized PERG visual display unit based
on variable polarization. Additionally, we used the CLAD deconvolution technique to extract additional
clinical information from the PERG response. Recording data from both glaucoma suspects and age
matched controls, the CLAD extracted data was more significantly different between the two
populations when compared to conventional techniques. Additionally, ROC curves generated from the
CLAD data had higher AUC values than the conventional techniques (0.897 using CLAD, versus 0.74 and
0.683 for conventional transient and steady state PERG). During Phase II, the following specific aims
will be pursued: 1) Refining the next generation PERG stimulator for humans. We will refine the
prototype developed in the phase I effort into a head mounted, near eye display configuration. We will
incorporate additional functionality, such as active fixation and pupil size monitoring and a disposable
dry electrode interface (based on Phase I effort) which will minimize patient preparation and increase
throughput and remove the need for sanitizing device between subjects. 2) Expanding CLAD in
Glaucoma. As part of our phase I effort, we showed that the CLAD technique has the potential to
increase the clinical utility of the well establish, but underutilized PERG response. In our Phase II effort,
we will expand testing in glaucoma suspects, looking at the effects of temporal presentation rate, and
the dynamic adaptation of the PERG response. Research has shown that both of these factors are
affected in patients with retinal dysfunction. Looking at these additional applications of the CLAD
analysis techniques in a larger patient pool will further expand on the work done in the Phase I effort
and continue to expand on the clinical utility of the PERG response."
10833709,"ABSTRACT
Conduct disorder (CD) remains one of the most common, impairing, and costliest psychiatric disorders among
youth. Youth with CD often face lifelong adjustment, mental health, legal, social, occupational, and physical
health problems. A subset of youth with CD display callous-unemotional (CU) traits (termed “limited prosocial
emotions”). Youth with CD and CU traits are more likely to engage in chronic criminal behaviors and develop
psychopathology into adulthood when compared to youth with CD only. Although both CD and CU traits are
inextricably linked to poor outcomes, there remains a scarcity of targeted interventions for CD and CU traits. One
of the most significant challenges for treatment is that youth with CD are often perceived as treatment-resistant
and treatment disrupters. This leads to poor treatment retention and further isolation from treatment
opportunities. Interventions that do exist largely focus on reducing antisocial behavior rather than disrupting the
developmental mechanisms of CD and CU traits. Arche VR, LLC, a Virginia-based small business, aims to offer
a solution to this problem by providing a culturally appropriate, cutting-edge virtual reality (VR) intervention for
CD and CU traits called Impact VR. Impact VR provides brief psychoeducational programming for emotion
regulation and emotion recognition training using immersive gameplay and storylines that are engaging and
relevant to youth. Impact VR is developed using evidence-based strategies to improve emotion regulation. At
the center of Impact VR is an individualized training program that teaches youth to effectively identify emotional
expressions in others. Impact VR uses cutting-edge technologies, including integrated eye-tracking and real-
time adaptive programming to adjust instruction based on the youths' performance. This ensures that youth
receive tailored, individualized treatment without the risk of floor and ceiling effects. Further, Impact VR provides
a resource-efficient and standardized treatment approach for systems (e.g., schools, hospitals) to help improve
access to evidence-based mental health treatment for youth with CD by targeting the mechanisms of CD and
CU traits. The overall objective of this proposal is to refine Impact VR to be an engaging and topic-relevant
intervention that youth with CD will want to participate in, and to determine the feasibility and usability of the
deployment of Impact VR across treatment settings (i.e., in the home, school, and mental health settings). Lastly,
this study includes a randomized control trial (RCT) to assess the preliminary efficacy of Impact VR for reducing
CD, CU traits, and conduct problems (CP) and improving emotion recognition and regulation. Outcomes from
this Phase I study include overall improvements in Impact VR as a deployment-ready, effective, and engaging
treatment strategy for youth with CD and CU traits."
10910054,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A fundamental goal of neuroscience is to determine how different brain regions contribute to behavior (i.e.
structure-function relationships). Although significant progress has been made in discovering regional functions
that are common across individuals, we know little about how structure-function relationships differ between
individuals. Recent evidence suggests that there are many such individual differences in brain activity, with
factors like genetics and sex have outsize influence on patterns of brain activity. But the molecular basis of these
differences, and their consequences for behavior, are unknown. To begin exploring this new territory, we will (1)
identify brain regions whose relationship to behavior is influenced by genetics and sex, and (2) identify
neurotransmitters and receptors that underlie the influence of genes and sex on brain function and behavior. We
will do this by measuring patterns of whole-brain activity that underlie exploratory behavior and long-term
memory recall in adult zebrafish. Zebrafish are a genetically tractable animal model with several characteristics
that make them ideal for the present research: a small and simple morphology, a sophisticated behavioral
repertoire, and ease of genetic manipulation. As vertebrates, zebrafish retain a high similarity to mammals in
genetics and nervous system organization. Given that many mental health disorders manifest as alterations in
patterns of neural activity, understanding how individual differences in biology influence brain function and
behavior will inform the development of precision approaches for the treatment of disorders localized to the brain."
10700720,"Dengue virus (DV) is a global pandemic causing 400 million infections annually; many veterans are exposed to
dengue while serving in endemic areas. There are 4 co-circulating viruses, severe disease is most commonly
seen with 2nd infections and caused by low-titer antibodies from first infection mediating enhanced
viremia/disease on 2nd infection (ADE). To date there are no therapies or vaccines safe in all people, however
TDV/TAK003, a live attenuated tetravalent vaccine, has shown good safety and protection up to 4.5 years post
vaccination, and just received its first approval. This is the first dengue vaccine safe and protective in a DV
seronegative population. TDV/TAK003 induces type-specific neutralizing antibodies to DV2, and mostly cross-
reactive antibodies to DV1,3, and 4. TDV/TAK003 includes CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes, unlike the earlier
Dengvaxia, which caused increased disease in DV seronegatives, did not. We have shown that TDV/TAK003
induces durable type-specific CD4+ and C8+ T cell responses, still detectable 10 years post vaccination, while
a single natural infection does not. Further, TDV/TAK003 induces multifunctional cytotoxic CD4+ T cells,
which are not seen after first infection but are seen after 2nd infection, per our data and reported by others. We
hypothesize that TDV/TAK003 induces a durable immune phenotype comparable to immunity after 2 DV
infections, the current best model of protection in humans. Since TDV/TAK003 may receive wide approval in
the next year, it is vital to better understand the type, specificity, and durability of post vaccination immunity in
seronegatives and how this compares with seropositive vaccinees (who have stronger and broader protection)
and immunity after 2nd infection. Durability of immunity is key after vaccination, especially in dengue, given the
risk of severe disease as immunity wanes. We have an ongoing study with multiple stored serum and PBMC
samples from TDV/TAK003 vaccinees and infected veterans, and collaborators in Puerto Rico and Colombia
will provide us with samples from seropositive vaccinees and people with post 2nd infection immunity. We
hypothesize that durable protective immunity after TDV/TAK003 vaccination in seropositives and
seronegatives is mediated by multiple mechanisms, including durable type-specific polyfunctional CD4+
cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), memory B cell secreted antibodies (MBCs) and Fc-mediated antibody cytotoxicity
(ADCC) in addition to better studied type-specific neutralizing antibodies. We hypothesize that vaccine
immunity is broader and more sustained than immunity after 1st DV infection, and closer to immunity after 2nd
infection. We hypothesize that TDV/TAK003 immunity is durable and protects from DV disease in an adoptive
transfer murine model up to 10 years after vaccination. To challenge our hypotheses, we will
Aim 1: Determine the specificity and functionality of durable B cell immunity in seronegative and seropositive
TDV/TAK003 vaccinees compared with people recovered from 1st and 2nd DV infections.
Aim 2: Determine if multifunctional type-specific CD4+ CTLs seen after 2nd infections (thus associated with
protection) are uniquely induced by vaccination and 2nd but not 1st infection, and kill DV+ target cells.
Aim 3: Determine if durable seronegative immunity after TDV/TAK003 vaccination inhibits DV
replication/disease in an adoptive transfer murine model, and if this inhibition is comparable in strength and
breadth to seropositive TDV/TAK003 vaccinees and 2nd infections."

How does the brain balance the need to preserve prior knowledge with the necessity to continuously learn
new information? The tradeoﬀ between stability and plasticity is inherent in both biological and artiﬁcial
learning systems constrained by ﬁnite resources and capacity. The hippocampus is a brain region critical for
memory formation and spatial learning, which can provide a powerful experimental system for characterizing
this tradeoﬀ. The role of the hippocampus in spatial cognition is supported by the ﬁnding that pyramidal
neurons in this area (place cells) ﬁre in speciﬁc locations in an environment (place ﬁelds). The population of
place cells active in an environment is believed to form a neural representation or cognitive map of that
environment. Spatial learning is critical for survival and involves two competing constraints: representations of
space must be plastic to enable fast learning of new environments and changes in behavioral contingencies,
and stable over time to enable recognition of familiar environments, reliable navigation, and leveraging of
previous learning. How do these competing constraints aﬀect the stability of place ﬁelds across time? The
experimental characterization of the long-term stability of spatial representations in the hippocampus has
been challenging as it requires tracking the activity of multiple place cells across extended periods of time
(days to weeks). We propose to use novel approaches in large-scale electrophysiology and imaging in
behaving rodents to characterize which neurons change their spatial tuning and how these changes depend
on behavior. Furthermore, we will use recordings and circuit perturbations to characterize the activity patterns
that predict changes in tuning stability. Our analysis will be carried out in the context of a theoretical
framework for understanding the interplay between plasticity and stability of hippocampal representations.
Characterizing the evolution of neural representations is of fundamental importance in understanding how
information is maintained across brain circuits and how such maintenance is perturbed in brain disorders."

10810823,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced Treat-All guidelines for people living with HIV, which
recommend immediate initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment upon diagnosis regardless of disease
severity. Since then, most countries worldwide have adopted the policy. However, the understanding of the impact of
such policy is quite limited, especially regarding HIV disease progression. Focused on event history outcome
(represented by WHO clinical stages and death), we recently conducted a preliminary analysis. We used data from
the Central Africa region of the International epidemiology Database to Evaluate AIDS (CA-IeDEA) for a multistate
model based on a target trial design (where two cohorts were constructed, one before and one after the policy
adoption). This work illuminated several limitations. For example, the assumption of non-informative censoring was
unlikely to hold for all censored individuals due to loss of follow-up or transfer out. Also, the relatively small sample
size of the CA-IeDEA hindered our capacities to 1) explore more clinically relevant and biologically plausible models
for HIV disease progression and 2) explore population heterogeneities regarding the impact of the Treat-All on the
outcome. In the proposed study, we plan to address these limitations by developing new statistical methods and
leveraging the multi-regional, i.e., the global-IeDEA data, which will provide a substantially larger sample. We will
develop procedures to address informative (dependent) censoring for the multistate models under the target trial
design to allow for sensitivity analysis. For example, we propose parametric, nonparametric, and semi-parametric
approaches to handle censoring at random. In addition, we offer a controlled multiple imputation method to handle
censoring not at random. We will compare and validate those methods using both internal and external data. Finally,
we will comprehensively analyze the global-IeDEA data, where the sensitivity analysis will ensure the robustness of
our findings. The proposed work will advance research in HIV care by providing more detailed information on possible
evolutionary courses of HIV disease progression and factors that modify the effectiveness of Treat-All. Our analysis
is a first step towards developing more precise patient treatment options and resource allocation, thereby improving
patient outcomes. The proposed statistical methods may also have applications to model other diseases that evolve
through predefined clinical states with intermittent data collection schema subject to similar data complexities."
10875616,"Intervening with Haitian Immigrants in the U.S. to Improve HIV Outcomes
PROJECT SUMMARY
The U.S. is home to the largest population of Haitian immigrants in the world, yet little is known about Haitian
immigrants living with HIV (HILWH) beyond what was known in the pre-TasP era, and no evidence-based
engagement and retention intervention strategies have been developed. For Haitian immigrants and other
foreign-born in the U.S., the HIV care continuum is anything but continuous. Delay in diagnosis and treatment is
dominant; disruption in care due to unmet needs is commonplace. The threat of a virus hidden from view
competes with more visible socioeconomic and legal threats. Lateness in care is just one more stigmatizing
situation; intersecting stigmas mean a myriad of faces downturned, closed, or worse. Into this mix is the recent
push to prioritize research of the longitudinal and experiential aspects of care and tailor engagement strategies
to groups not yet benefiting from “getting to zero” biomedical advancements. Missing from this current era of
intervention development are HILWH. Based on two decades of research in Haiti and S. Florida, which holds the
largest proportion of Haitian immigrants in the U.S., we propose a study that will bring HILWH into the current
generation of research. This proposed R34 in response to PA-20-141 stems from our recent work with the first
community adaptation of the iENGAGE intervention for implementation with African American and Hispanic
people living with HIV. The iENGAGE brief intervention model is geared to the care cascade and problem-solves
unmet needs, stigma, mental health and other comorbidities within a social-ecological information-motivation-
behavioral framework, utilizing motivational interviewing components, and has shown effectiveness on
internalized stigma. We propose to adapt the iENGAGE model to HILWH in Miami, which is home to the full
range of the Haitian diaspora experience. The aims of our study will: use mixed methods to produce multi-level
formative data on barriers to engagement, retention, and viral suppression across HILWH, stakeholders, and a
full spectrum of providers (Aim 1); culturally adapt and evaluate a Haitian immigrant iENGAGE for preliminary
efficacy in a quasi-experimental pilot among recently diagnosed or nonvirally suppressed adults (Aim 2); and
identify multi-level implementation factors affecting outcomes using mixed methods (Aim 3). We will adapt
photovoice techniques sensitive to sociocultural constraints among HILWH to enhance mixed methods. The
study will bring a long-neglected immigrant group into the longitudinal scope of HIV Care Cascade (HCC)
research and adapt and test a promising intervention specific to their persistent HIV outcome disparities in an
epicenter of both the epidemic and the Haitian immigrant diaspora. The study fills singular gaps for this
population, responds to NIH’s recent joint publication prioritizing adaptation of interventions for stigmatized
populations, and prepares the way for an R01 of national significance."
10700473,"Aged epidermis shows progressive defects in proliferation, differentiation and barrier formation, manifesting as
eczematous dermatoses, xerosis, itch and increased susceptibility to contact dermatitis and infections.
Previously, we found that defects in epidermal calcium signaling, transduced through the plasma membrane
calcium receptor (CaSR), underlie intrinsic aging. In preliminary findings we show that CaSR expression
decreases in aged epidermis and CaSR agonists rescue calcium signaling, E-cadherin reorganization, growth
and migration in aged keratinocytes, epidermal equivalents and aged or CaSR-/- mice. Because burn pit
pollution also causes premature skin aging (extrinsic skin aging) and is a focus of veteran health, we propose
to determine what age-related transcriptional or epigenetic mechanisms drive intrinsic vs. extrinsic aging. We
next will assess how increasing CaSR expression or function, using exogenous vitamin D or CaSR agonists,
rescue intrinsic or extrinsic age-related epidermal defects. Finally, we will use these results to develop
therapeutic approaches that ameliorate calcium signaling and differentiation/barrier defects in intrinsically aged
mice or mice whose skin is prematurely aged due to particulate pollution.
The overall hypothesis of this project is that the age-related decreases in calcium signaling dysregulate
intrinsic and extrinsic keratinocyte differentiation and barrier homeostasis.
The overall goal of this project is to normalize age-related epidermal defects by enhancing calcium signaling
and CaSR expression/function."

training program, “Translational Science Training to Reduce the Impact of Alcohol on HIV Infection”. This
training need remains significant across the state of Florida which continues to rank among the top 3 states in
new HIV infections per year and total HIV/AIDS cases. Alcohol consumption, and related issues such as drug
use and mental health, contributes to enduring HIV transmission and to poor HIV outcomes. We need an
interdisciplinary research task force skilled in alcohol research to help reduce HIV transmission and HIV-
related comorbidities. The specific aims of our T32 are to: (1) Deliver an outstanding training curriculum
focused on alcohol and HIV that incorporates three key focus areas (health behavior intervention science,
epidemiology and data science, and cognitive science related to aging); (2) Provide effective mentorship for
establishing or advancing programs of research in alcohol and HIV science; (3) Facilitate leaderships skills and
experience collaborating with multidisciplinary research teams; (4) Promote excellence in the communication
and dissemination of alcohol and HIV science; and (5) Ensure professionalism and ethical conduct of research.
The training program will support five pre-doctoral and two post-doctoral trainees at any time and be based in 6
academic programs. The program is led by three MPIs who represent departments of Epidemiology, Health
Education and Behavior, and Nursing. We will provide in-depth training around the intersection of alcohol and
HIV, together with three additional focus areas: a) health behavior intervention science; b) epidemiology and
data science integrated with the UF AI initiative; and c) cognitive science related to aging. Training activities
include required courses, T32 Program activities, and training activities associated with the Southern HIV
Alcohol Research Consortium (SHARC), itself supported by over $10 million in ongoing NIH funding through
2022. Trainees also will receive training in the responsible conduct of research. The research environment is
strong at the University of Florida, which collectively has pledged an additional $500,000 in overall support to
our specific training program. Given the success of our trainees to date, and breadth and depth of our faculty
mentors’ expertise around alcohol and HIV, we reaffirm our readiness and commitment to training the next
cohort of researchers to reduce the risk of negative health outcomes from alcohol and HIV infection throughout
Florida and beyond."

essential and multifaceted roles in the virus biology. Lenacapavir (LEN) is a recently discovered first-in-class,
long-acting capsid-targeting inhibitor with picomolar potency against HIV-1. Phase 2/3 clinical trials have
revealed that subcutaneous administration of LEN with a six-month dosing interval enables high rates of HIV-1
suppression in heavily treatment-experienced patients infected with multi-drug resistant viral phenotypes. These
findings have highlighted LEN as a promising agent that could complement current antiretroviral compounds to
treat people living with HIV-1. However, cell culture-based viral breakthrough assays and clinical trials have
identified a number of CA substitutions that confer substantial resistance to LEN. Specifically, Q67H/N74D and
M66I substitutions emerged as major drug-resistance associated variants. Therefore, there is a need to develop
improved LEN analogs with a higher barrier to resistance. We have established synthesis of LEN in academic
setting by utilizing a modular approach of independently preparing three unique LEN subunits (A, B, and C) from
commercially available reagents. Such modular approach allows for straightforward modifications of each
subunit which can then be combined in any order to prepare LEN and its analogs. Thus, our medicinal chemistry
strategy is highly advantageous for analog development. Our complementary virology, biochemistry and
structural biology experiments have allowed us to characterize a multi-modal mechanism of action of LEN.
Furthermore, we have recently determined high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of CA hexamers containing
major drug-resistance associated Q67H/N74D and M66I changes. We propose to exploit these findings to
rationally develop improved LEN analogs with a higher barrier to resistance. In Aim 1, our efforts will focus on
modifications to LEN subunits A and C to overcome steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsions created by the
drug resistant Q67H/N74D CA variant. In aim 2, we will use our recent promising findings from MiniFrags
screening studies, which identified fragments that bind to the CA hydrophobic pocket in close vicinity to LEN.
We will synthesize new chemotypes by connecting these fragments to LEN to generate second-generation
analogs to target the major drug-resistant M66I variant. Newly synthesized compounds from both Aims 1 and 2
will be evaluated by a stepwise approach using antiviral activity, cytotoxicity, surface plasmon resonance and X-
ray crystallography to identify and characterize the lead compound(s). Taken together, the proposed research is
expected to generate novel chemotypes with improved antiviral activities against major drug resistant CA
variants that confer substantial resistance to parental LEN."
10813058,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a poorly understood neurodegenerative disease characterized
predominantly by motor neuron death with no effective treatment to date. ALS has been designated as a service
connected disease by VA since Veterans are at a higher risk of contracting this devastating and fatal disease.
The PI of this Research Career Scientist (RCS) application, Dr. Haining Zhu, has been working on ALS for 20
years since he started his independent academic career. The long-term goal of his research program is to
determine the molecular mechanisms of ALS disease pathogenesis and progression. Empowered by better
mechanistic understandings, his laboratory is also engaged in translational research to discover novel
therapeutic targets and to identify compounds for drug development. The success of his research program will
benefit the healthcare of veterans, particularly those afflicted with ALS.
 Dr. Zhu's VA-funded Merit project is to study the RNA binding protein Fused in Sarcoma (FUS), which
has been implicated in both familial and sporadic ALS. Familial ALS represents approximately 10-15% of all
cases and ALS genes provide much-needed “molecular handles” for studying mechanisms that might be
relevant to all ALS cases. His laboratory has been working on the function of FUS protein under physiological
and pathological conditions. His laboratory has made several novel findings, including the identification of the
nuclear localization sequence (NLS) in FUS (Gal, 2011), the determination of the crystal structure of FUS NLS
in complex with the nuclear transport receptor transportin 1 (Niu, 2012), and the characterization of one of the
first Drosophila models (Xia, 2012). Two of his studies were published in PNAS in 2014 and 2018, respectively.
His laboratory demonstrated that liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of the FUS protein played a critical role
in chromatin binding and transcription regulation (Yang, 2014). His laboratory also found that FUS-positive
granules contained proteins involved in protein translation and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of RNA.
Moreover, mutant FUS suppressed protein translation and hyper-activated NMD (Kamelgarn, 2018). This work
was considered so significant that PNAS published an accompanying Commentary.
 In the current funding period (renewed in 2020 until 2024), the overarching hypothesis is that the
dysregulation of protein translation and RNA nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) contributes to FUS toxicity and
motor neuron dysfunction. His laboratory proposed to determine (1) what properties of mutant FUS drive the
dysregulation of protein translation and NMD; (2) whether mRNA decay and protein translation are impacted
by mutant FUS with any specificity; and (3) whether corrections of these defects restore the balance between
protein translation and NMD.
 During the proposed RCS period, Dr. Zhu plans to expand his research program by focusing on three
directions. The first is to use the unique unaffected mutation carriers in the familial ALS cohort to identify
resilience factors. The second is to use patient-derived iPSC lines for translational research and therapeutic
development. The third is to identify and optimize better compounds to promote PTC readthrough as a
potential therapy for a related neurodegenerative disease, frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
 After relocating to Tucson, AZ in July 2021, Dr. Zhu has actively engaged in several functions and
collaborations at Southern Arizona VA Healthcare System (SAVAHCS). Dr. Zhu started to serve as the site PI
of VA Biorepository Brain Bank (BBB), which is the sole ALS biorepository in the entire VA system. This joint
operation with the Boston VA provides a critical resource for the entire ALS research community. In addition to
leading a productive research program, he serves on VA committees at the local and national levels. He
collaborates with many VA and non-VA scientists. The support from the RCS program will enable Dr. Zhu to
make continuous progress in ALS research and to benefit the healthcare of veterans."
10931406,"OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The long-term goals of this renewal P01 are to develop next generation immunotherapy with chimeric antigen
receptor (CAR) T cells and to translate this research into new therapies with curative potential for patients with
blood cancer. The CAR developed at our center was the first cell and gene therapy to ever receive approval from
the FDA, initially for refractory/relapsed pre-B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in 2017 and lymphoma in
2018. However, multiple myeloma (MM), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
remain as the major unmet medical need in blood cancers. Our central hypothesis is that therapies with
combination of CAR T cells and advanced forms of human genome editing will enable this powerful therapy to
reach a broader spectrum of patients with blood cancer. We have brought together a cadre of exceptional
investigators from multiple disciplines who have collaborated and published together for many years. Each
disease-focused project will be led by recognized authorities in the field. To achieve our goals, we have three
Projects that build on progress during the previous funding period and will continue to coordinate closely with
essential shared resource cores. In Project 1, we will determine the clinical and immunological impact of treating
patients on two clinical trials: (i) CAR T cells targeting CD19 will be tested with genetic disruption of CD5, CTLA-
4 and TET2 to address CLL and lymphoma, which is lack of sustained effector CAR T function in these patients.
In AML, the central problem in CAR T cell therapy is the lack of a known surface antigen that is present on AML
but lacking from normal hematopoiesis. The goal of Project 2 is to open a wide therapeutic window for AML by
genetically-modifying normal marrow to make it resistant to killing by anti-AML CAR T cells, and delivering potent
anti-leukemic CAR T cells specific for CD45. Engineered HSC that are genetically edited to install a
hematopoietic system facilitating non-toxic therapy with these potent CAR T cells will be developed. In Project
3, the overall hypothesis is that anti-myeloma efficacy will be maximized by (i) testing the efficacy of marrow-
derived CAR T compared to current standard of care blood-derived CAR T (ii) improving persistence of BCMA
CAR T with orthogonally mutated IL-2/IL-2R technology and mRNA/lipid-nanoparticle vaccine technology to
overcome suboptimal persistence and efficacy of current BCMA T cells.
The Scientific and Administrative Cores for this P01 are essential for our progress including provision of project
management for collaboration and biostatistics, clinical safety and monitoring, and fiscal support (Core A), a
GMP facility for manufacture of cells and identification of new binders for CAR targets (Core B), and a state-of-
the-art platform for GLP analysis to provide high dimensional data of the samples generated in all Projects (Core
C). Our renewal application has the potential for paradigm-shifting impact to transform the lessons of CAR T for
ALL into meaningful efficacy against all hematologic malignancies, solid cancers and provides direction for
extending beyond cancer to autoimmune disorders."
10931418,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (PROJECT 2): Next-generation genetic engineering of the pan-leukocyte
antigen CD45 to facilitate CAR-T cell therapy against hematologic malignancies
Currently, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells must be individually designed for each disease, targeting
lineage-associated antigens such as CD19 for B-cell malignancies or BCMA for myeloma. While this approach
has led to the successful treatment of hundreds of patients on clinical trials or with commercial CAR-T cell
therapies, from a drug development standpoint this approach is inefficient. By targeting a pan-hematologic
antigen, a single “drug” could be used for all indications, thereby accelerating clinical research. CD45 is a
receptor tyrosine phosphatase that is expressed on the surface of most hematopoietic cells, from immature stem
cells to differentiated progeny. As expected, antibody-drug conjugates targeting CD45 cause profound
myeloablation and are in clinical development as conditioning agents prior to stem cell transplantation. A unique
hurdle limiting the use of anti-CD45 CAR T cells (CART-45) is that T cells themselves express CD45, and CART-
45 are therefore vulnerable to fratricide. Furthermore, CD45 is crucial for proper function of the T cell immune
synapse. The overarching goal of this project is to render CD45 targetable using genetic engineering of
T cells and of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). To achieve this goal, we will test the central hypothesis that
site-specific mutation of CD45 in hematopoietic cells (including T cells) can abrogate recognition by CART-45
while retaining all other domains required for the function of this molecule. We expect that this approach will
prevent T cell dysfunction and myeloablation. This will be accomplished in three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will
generate fratricide-resistant CD45-targeting CAR-T cells. We have identified a candidate CAR construct based
on unbiased functional screening and shown that CART-45 are indeed subject to fratricide. While this fratricide
could be rescued by CRISPR-based knock out of CD45, CD45-deficient CART cells were dysfunctional. Using
alanine mutagenesis, we then identified the target epitope on CD45 that is recognized by our lead CAR candidate
and we have now successfully edited this epitope to abrogate fratricide, resulting in CAR-T cells that recognize
native CD45 in trans without themselves being the target of anti-CD45 CAR. In this aim we will test the hypothesis
that the function of CD45-edited T cells is equivalent to unmodified control T cells, and superior to that of CD45-
deleted T cells. In Aim 2, we will genetically engineer hematopoietic stem cells to generate a CART-resistant
hematopoietic system. To demonstrate that engineered CD34+ HSC’s are resistant to CD45 targeted CAR-T
cell therapy, engineered HSPC’s will be engrafted into immunodeficient mice followed by treatment with CD45
CAR-T cells. Finally, to target CD45 in human AML we will disrupt CD45 expression in primary human AML and
test leukemogenicity in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 3 up to 6 patients will undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation
using donor stem cells where CD45 expression has been edited using CRISPR/Cas9, followed by infusion of
donor-derived CART-45. Successful completion of this Aim will provide proof-of-concept for our overall strategy
to create a leukemia-specific antigen using gene editing tools."
10887524,"ABSTRACT
 Total hip and knee replacements (“total joint replacements” [TJRs]) are highly successful surgeries for
patients with end-stage arthritis. Despite their clinical benefits, racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in
the use and outcomes of these surgeries are well-established. These disparities have persisted for decades
despite well-intentioned and effective disparity reduction strategies that have been locally implemented. In the
absence of a national reform that incentivizes disparity reduction, the vision of achieving TJR equity may
remain unfulfilled. Medicare’s 2016 Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) model is a bundled
payment reform aimed at improving quality and reducing spending for Medicare beneficiaries undergoing
TJRs. In 2021, the CJR was redesigned (rCJR) to include adjustments for social risk (dual-eligibility for
Medicare and Medicaid) and clinical risk (hierarchical condition category score and age) – measures that could
potentially reduce TJR disparities by ‘recognizing’ the higher spending for marginalized patients (many of
whom belong to racial/ethnic minority or lower socioeconomic groups, and are in poorer health). These
adjustments are likely to reduce incentives for hospitals to avoid operating on marginalized patients, provide
these patients access to high-quality hospitals, and increase quality/price competition between hospitals to
attract these patients; thereby promoting equity in TJR use and postoperative outcomes. In theory, the new risk
adjustment measures could potentially transform the rCJR into a national TJR disparity reduction strategy.
However, there is little empirical evidence to support our hypothesis. Thus, our objective is to evaluate rCJR’s
association with racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in TJR use, outcomes, and spending, with a focus
on the performance of safety-net hospitals. We will use national Medicare data from 2018-2024 to evaluate
rCJR’s association with disparities in the use of TJRs (Aim 1) and in clinical metrics (Aim 2). We will also
examine whether the rCJR may have influenced TJR spending for marginalized patients (Aim 3). Our work is
significant because we will answer questions such as whether the rCJR was effective in reducing disparities,
which metrics were most influenced by the rCJR, and which institutions successfully reduced disparities. These
findings are critical for understanding whether and how the rCJR can be leveraged to reduce disparities
nationally, and for realizing the elusive target of equity in TJR care for patients with arthritis."
10932180,"Project Summary
This proposal aims to develop computational tools that analyze the structural variability of the
macromolecules imaged by Cryogenic electron microscopy (CryoEM) and Cryogenic electron tomography
(CryoET). As the function of most macromolecules involves dynamic interactions among their own
components or with other molecules, the structural flexibility of those macromolecules is often key to
accomplishing their functions. CryoEM/CryoET makes snapshots of macromolecules embedded in vitrified
ice, which provides direct information of individual protein particles in different compositional and
conformational states. Using advanced computational methods, we will be able to resolve the structural
heterogeneity of proteins and gain a deeper understanding of their structure-function relationship. The
algorithm developed in this proposal will be using the Gaussian mixture model for protein structure
representation and deep neural network for embedding snapshot images of proteins onto a latent space
depicting their conformational states. In this proposal, we address the issue of protein structural variability
from three aspects. First, we will build a pipeline for simultaneous orientation and conformation refinement
for single particle analysis, which will make it possible to solve systems with large-scale structural variability.
Second, we will integrate constraints from molecular models into our pipeline, so that prior knowledge from
biochemistry can be used to guide the protein heterogeneity analysis. Finally, we will focus on CryoET and
expand the method to look into the dynamic of macromolecular systems inside cells. In sum, the proposed
work will produce software tools for a comprehensive analysis of protein structural variability, which will
provide new insights into the functioning mechanism of macromolecules."

Aerobic exercise (AE) is one of the most promising, accessible, and cost-effective methods for reducing
risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD), and for improving brain health and cognition
in older adults. However, we do not fully understand the mechanisms by which AE-induced changes in the
brain improve cognition and reduce the likelihood of transitioning to cognitive impairment. Cerebrovascular
alterations progress with aging and have been identified as one of the primary factors associated with cognitive
decline. Therefore,
one leading hypothesis is that AE can modify aging-associated cerebrovascular
deteriorations
by accumulating long-term adaptations through repeated training sessions. These
cerebrovascular changes could mediate improvements in structure and function in the brain, and associate
with cognitive improvement. However, we still do not fully understand these possible mechanisms, nor the
most effective doses to maximize cerebrovascular improvements. In order to assess cerebrovascular changes
and their relationship with structural and functional brain changes in response to an AE intervention, we
propose to conduct a secondary data analysis using a Phase III randomized clinical trial (RCT) of aerobic
exercise called Investigating Gains in Neurocognition in an Intervention Trial of Exercise (IGNITE). The
IGNITE study included pre- and post-intervention assessments from a 12-month supervised exercise
intervention in 648 cognitively normal adults between 65 and 80 years of age. Participants were randomized to
one of 3 different dosage groups (n=213 each): (i) a moderate intensity AE of 150 min/week (the public-health
recommended dose), (ii) a moderate intensity AE condition of 225 min/week, and (iii) a stretching control
condition of 150 min/ week. We will test (1) whether a 12-month RCT of AE modifies cerebrovascular
pulsatility and blood flow and whether these changes mediate improvements in cognition, (2) whether AE-
induced cerebrovascular changes mediate improvements in brain atrophy, functional connectivity, and reduce
WMH growth. We will also test whether any effects are associated with pre-existing health status, such as
hypertension and
type2 diabetes, which are associated with risk for AD/ADRD and linked to AD pathology (e.g.
Ab and tau)
. We will also examine whether biological sex moderates the results found in aims 1 and 2.
We
hypothesize that the group receiving 225 min/week will show the greatest cerebrovascular improvements and
that these improvements mediate structural and functional brain changes. We also expect that the
cerebrovascular improvements with AE will occur in region-specific manner and lead to domain-specific
cognitive improvements that are related to those areas. This proposal employs a highly cost-effective approach
by focusing on the secondary data analysis of an NIH-funded RCT and is therefore in line with the NIA mission
to use data from existing cohorts to address important questions about how exercise prevents cognitive decline
in late life. These findings could establish a framework for managing age-related cerebrovascular changes by
participation in regular AE and could provide public policy guidance for using exercise as an approach for
mitigating risks associated with vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). The
results from this research could also lead to more effective preventive and therapeutic strategies to decrease the
burden of AD/ADRD."
10896967,"Abstract:
Currently RAS has been considered a high value target in cancer drug development considering
that over 30 percent of all human cancers – including 95% of pancreatic cancers and 45% of
colorectal cancers — are driven by mutations of the RAS family of genes. The first clinical
launch of a G12C KRAS inhibitor is Lumakras™ (sotorasib) from Amgen for non-small cell lung
carcinoma and Mirati Adagrasib™ is on the way to approval with its G12C inhibitor however, the
development of G12D and V inhibitors of KRAS are stalled in the preclinical realm with similar
strategies used for G12C inhibitors which is likely more difficult or impossible to apply to other
mutations. In addition, then there is also the challenge of overactive wildtype RAS mutations
where targeting mutations in the protein become difficult with an overactive RAS pathway which
can result from RAS upregulation or dysregulation of its partnering proteins. This is not
addressed by the current approaches which seeks to inhibit the mutant forms only but in fact
has led to a mechanism of resistance within the mutant forms of RAS with a complex network of
pathways where isotypes of RAS are involved. Here we present what is unfolding as another
possible target for oncogenic RAS. A hallmark of all oncogenic RAS is suppression of
Phosphatase and tensin homolog is a phosphatase (PTEN) expression. PTEN is a multi-
functional tumor suppressor that is very commonly lost in human cancer but is a requirement in
cancerous RAS signaling to prevent the cells from being able to die (causing immortalization).
Thus, this is widely regarded as a driver mutation. The other hallmark of oncogenic RAS
signaling is a protein known as GSK3 is overexpressed. We have recently reported BCN057
restores PTEN expression to abrogate the immortalized phenotype in oncogenic KRAS. Why
this is important is because the signal transduction “wiring” appears to differ in KRAS mutant vs
normal tissue. Thus, normal tissue responds by increasing its resistance to chemotherapy and
radiation while inducing cell death in the KRAS mutant tumor cells resulting in an increase in the
therapeutic index. This is a breakthrough for oncogenic KRAS epithelial cancers and colorectal
cancer treatment and may eventually have significant implications for a variety of cancers. In
the US alone there are over 150,000 new cases of colorectal cancers and studies like
Foundation Medicine (FM) estimate a KRAS mutation frequency of approximately 50%. In
summary, the proposed work will provide a clear path to subsequent studies related to product
development in a phase II application."

Union College's ABET accredited Biomedical Engineering (BME) Program places an emphasis on close
faculty-student interaction and hands-on learning in educating undergraduate students, culminating in an
immersive Senior year Capstone Design experience. As the next generation of medical device designers, BME
students need to meet the challenges of innovating and developing solutions to address shortcomings in
current medical device technology while navigating a very complex pathway to commercialization of a new
medical device. At the cornerstone of this proposal is an established collaboration with the Albany Medical
College's Biomedical Acceleration and Commercialization Center (AMC/BACC), which enables high-impact
learning in a clinical setting. In addition, Union is further enriching its BME curriculum with an expanded, two-
term (20-week) Capstone Design Course Sequence. With these elements in place, the framework exists to
support the development of an enhanced Capstone Design experience with three specific aims: (1) Create a
sustainable Summer Clinical Immersion Program (SCIP); (2) Offer enhanced hands-on prototyping (HOP)
opportunities for solution iteration in tandem with close faculty supervision and external mentorship throughout
the Capstone Design Course Sequence; and (3) Jump-start (JUMP) design projects towards translation. The
proposed educational activities will enable students to begin their Capstone Design experience earlier, during
the Spring term of their Junior year, and extend the work on their designs through the Spring term of their
Senior year. This full year experience coupled with mentorship by program faculty, physicians, industry
experts, and entrepreneurs will significantly increase students' ability to traverse the path from initial problem
identification to prototype solution development. The proposed enhanced Capstone Design experience will
also give students more time for in-depth exploration of issues related to biomedical device translation before
they graduate. One measure of success will be the commercialization potential of the solutions that have been
prototyped by the student teams. AMC/BACC's technology transfer process will be employed to assess
patentability of designs, and the expertise at AMC/BACC will help determine the viability of the team forming a
company to advance their solution towards translation. A second measure of success will be obtained by
surveying graduates to determine what career paths they have chosen, demonstrating that achievement of the
three aims better prepares students and opens up new opportunities for them to succeed in a variety of career
paths related to the development of biomedical technology. Assessment data will be used to inform new
iterations of the Capstone Design experience elements, including course materials, instruction methods,
mentors, topic areas, facilities, and equipment for prototyping that will improve students' success in developing
solutions to medical problems and finding productive careers in biomedical device development."
10832700,"The objective of this grant is the preclinical development of MRS-2541, a novel antibiotic structure
targeting Gram+ bacteria by a new mechanism of action. MRS-2541 inhibits bacterial methionyl-
tRNA synthetase required for bacterial protein synthesis, which is very different from its
mammalian counterpart. MRS-2541 is the result of an arduous testing cascade of over 500
compounds requiring broad-spectrum in vitro and in vivo Gram+ activity, a low resistance
frequency and minimal hERG and mitochondrial toxicity.
The initial clinical indication will be acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) with
clear endpoints and relatively easy enrollments. MRS-2541 is highly potent against serious
pathogens such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin resistant
Enterococcus faecium (VRE), and Streptococcus species, with minimum inhibitory concentrations
(MICs) ≤ 0.5 µg/mL, which are below those of widely used drugs such as vancomycin and
linezolid. MRS-2541 has minimal cytotoxicity on mammalian cells, is well tolerated in mice at 150
mg/Kg/day, has excellent oral bioavailability, and is as efficacious as linezolid in the S. aureus
and S. pyogenes thigh murine models of infection by both the oral and subcutaneous route.
Specific Aim 1 will be to optimize the new 5-step synthesis from a commercially available
fluorinated precursor and prepare 150 g for Aims 2-4. Aim 2 will characterize the PK/ADME profile
of MRS-2541, including metabolic profiling, cytochrome inhibition, and PK in a non-rodent
species. Aim 3 will more fully characterize the antibacterial profile with MIC90s vs target and some
off-target organisms, as well as the determination of the driver for in vivo efficacy, which is critical
for human dose projections. Finally, Aim 4 will support a GLP 28-day toxicology study in rodents
along with several safety pharmacology studies.
The scientific teams at University of Washington and TSRL have the combined expertise in
chemistry, microbiology, pharmacology, and preclinical drug development to execute the
proposed research plan. A successful project will bring forward MRS-2541 as a clinical lead
candidate, representing a novel antibiotic class to address the critical public health issue of
bacterial drug-resistance not only for ABSSSIs, but for a variety of serious Gram+ infections."
10930134,"Project Summary/Abstract: ALS and FTD are fatal neurodegenerative diseases that presently have no cure.
To date, one focus area in ALS research has been developing model systems to characterize the condition,
with over 20 different ALS mouse models, and more recently, numerous iPSC based models, each gradually
contributing to our overall knowledge of the mechanisms behind neurodegeneration, and the contribution of the
neuro-immune interface. Despite the multitude of disease models, there is no overarching, computational
modeling framework for integrating disparate datasets, towards the goal of characterizing disease networks,
and identifying therapeutic targets. Moreover, while standard ML models for target prediction have become
ubiquitous in the biomedical sciences, they fail to learn causality, shedding little insight into underlying disease
etiology and failing to make effective target predictions. Our proposal’s long-term goal is to create a flexible
pipeline, applicable to ND diseases, to characterize the neuro-immune interface and its contribution to ND
etiology, to enable therapeutic intervention by creating an integrated workflow to identify ND microglial disease
networks in health, disease, and disease subsets. We will capitalize on existing experimental data as well as
internal iPSC based in vitro models, paired with a causal ML model. Each component of this workflow can work
independently, or can be linked to the other in a powerful ‘active learning’ framework, in which the ML model
makes predictions, the co-culture system validates or disproves the prediction, and in each such round the in
silico model is refined by integrating the new experimental data. Our causal machine learning model
characterizes ND neuro-immune networks from analysis of combined molecular, clinical, and functional data in
a multi-layered format with individual layers for ND disease state, data platform, and cell state analyzed
simultaneously to bolster confidence for inferences shared among numerous layers and identify unique, and
therapeutically relevant, network elements. We will focus initially on therapeutic interventions for ALS, followed
by related ND diseases also characterized in the network model. The objectives of this proposal are: (1) to
refine an in silico framework for data integration across NDs, microglial subsets, and heterogeneous
datasets/data platforms enabling a robust model for therapeutic target prediction and (2) to validate predicted
targets in our iPSC microglia and neuron co-culture system using in vitro perturbations (including
antisense-oligonucleotides and small molecules) and high-content imaging analysis. The central
hypothesis is that comprehensively integrating available data across public datasets and databases, ND
diseases, model species, data platforms, and tissue types, with data from our co-culture screening platform, in
a powerful mechanistic model, will enable elucidation of causal disease pathways, comparative analysis across
conditions, and the identification of therapeutic targets. Ultimately, characterization of individuals can even
enable personalized therapy approaches as well as identification of disease subtypes.

complete biologically-driven, scientifically important, and clinically meaningful studies in cancer prevention,
control, and cancer care delivery, in adults, adolescents and young adults with or at risk for cancer, and to
improve quality of life and quality of survivorship for those with malignancies. Over the last grant cycle, the SWOG
NCORP RB exceeded expectations with regard to scientific productivity, rapid dissemination of results,
inclusiveness, faculty and student training, administrative efficiency, novel and complex trial designs, and
advancement of and incorporation of the patient voice into all aspects of our work. In particular, the SWOG
NCORP RB opens high-impact trials and conducts and completes them efficiently. During the reporting period,
we accrued a total of 11,470 patients, of which 9897 (86%) were placed onto SWOG-coordinated studies, and
1573 (14%) were SWOG sites enrolling onto non-SWOG studies. SWOG NCORP institutions provided 45% of
the accrual (n=4451) to SWOG-coordinated studies. Our results are widely disseminated and have informed
multiple practice symptom management and survivorship guidelines. We published results from a large number
of studies conducted during the last two cycles (125 manuscripts; 58 abstracts), with 34% issued in journals with
an impact factor > 10. Overall, 96 NCORP site members were represented as authors in 54 NCORP manuscripts
and abstracts. Over the next grant cycle, we will continue to expand our administrative and data infrastructure,
with initiatives addressing patient reported outcomes, a robust and modern data management and patient
reported outcomes core, enhanced engagement with community investigators and non-traditional partners,
augmented education and involvement of patient advocates, and new quality initiatives. We will expand our
research efforts in healthcare disparities across all committees, and we will collaboratively design, conduct, and

A comprehensive genome-wide map of DNA regulatory elements and gene expression in human cells is of
critical importance for understanding how genomic variation impacts human health and disease. Since regulatory
DNA elements are exceptionally cell type-, tissue-, and disease state-specific, a comprehensive catalog of these
elements has been difficult to achieve. The overall mission of this IGVF Mapping Center is to create a high-
quality, open-access, and single cell-resolution reference map of human regulatory elements and gene
expression in immune cells during human development, across organ systems in healthy adults, and in tissues
from diverse immune-related diseases. Our Mapping Center will leverage: (i) our recent advances in developing
scalable and cost-efficient single-cell epigenome and multi-omic technologies to simultaneously map open
chromatin sites, gene expression, intracellular and cell surface proteins, and clonal lineage tracing in each tissue
sample, (ii) our prior technical improvements and application of these methods to primary tissues from humans,
and (iii) our pre-existing human tissue biobank consisting of samples from more than 500 human individuals, 20
organ systems, and 15 disease conditions, consented for unrestricted access, genomic sequencing, and data
sharing. In Specific Aim 1, we will work closely with the IGVF Consortium to establish cross-center plans for data
generation, analyses, and effective coordination of sample access and sharing. In Specific Aim 2, we will
generate a single-cell multi-omic atlas of immune cell types (and non-immune cells types, as determined with
the IGVF) during development in early life, healthy aging, and across human organ systems. In Specific Aim 3,
we will generate a single-cell multi-omic atlas in immune cell types from primary tissues in patients with
autoimmunity, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and infection. In Specific Aim 4, we will analyze regulatory
sites and gene expression in the context of clonal differentiation trajectories inferred from mitochondrial lineage
tracing and develop and maintain an integrated reference map of each datatype and tissue sample for the

10913377,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Each year over 20 million adults with moderate fear and over 14 million adults with severe fear visit the
dentist. Because fear portends poor future oral health, patients with dental fear come to experience their worst
fears: pain, surgical procedures, and the need for more frequent dental visits. Avoidance is the natural and reinforced response, ironically guaranteeing a repetition of the feared events. Breaking this cycle is the primary
target of this proposal. Standard treatment — compassionate but ultimately counterproductive — includes anti-anxiety medication or more substantial anesthesia, which (a) does nothing to reduce subsequent anxiety or
avoidance, (b) leads to continued dental problems, and (c) perpetuates the cycle of fear—>avoidance—>dental
problems. Alternatively, cognitive-behavioral treatments (CBT) for dental fear have been developed, subjected
to dozens of high-quality trials, and found to be efficacious. However, CBT has, almost exclusively, been offered
only in a few specialty clinics worldwide associated with universities; there is no disseminable model for integrating CBT into the workflow of dental practices. To fill this gap, this Fast-Track STTR proposal describes
plans for development and testing of a marketable product that can bring effective dental fear treatment to
dental offices within the currently existing U.S. practice ecosystem. neVR Fear the DentistTM is a commercializable suite of self-administered eHealth tools to treat dental fear that can be implemented in private practice
dental offices throughout the U.S. and is eminently scalable. neVR Fear the DentistTM comprises three major
evidence-based interventions. First is a self-administered eHealth app for CBT/psychoeducation with exposure
therapy — delivered via a mobile tablet — that can be used privately in waiting rooms. Second is a communication-eliciting intervention, in which the patient records a “Pre-Game Plan” — to be reviewed with the dental
staff before dental services — comprising (1) pre-treatment fear levels, (2) the factor generating the most anxiety, (3) a stop-signal the patient will use to alert dentist, (4) things the dental team can do to maximize this patient's comfort, and (5) a self-generated anxiety management plan. All patients in the treatment group will receive the first two EBIs as a single intervention on the tablet. Third (for patients who are in the severe range) is
a 1-hr virtual reality exposure treatment (VRET). VRET will allow us to provide CBT that can be self-administered within the normal operations of dentistry and will allow every dental practice to be a dental fear specialty
clinic. Such an approach is necessary to shift clinical practice, as the nearly 200,000 U.S. dentists will only
adopt an approach designed, from the bottom up, to fit both the busy-ness and business of 21st-century dental
practices. The research component will use an adequately powered RCT to test both (a) the effectiveness of
neVR Fear the DentistTM and, using the NIH's Experimental Medicine Approach to Behavioral Change model,
(b) whether inhibitory learning is the mechanism through which it affects change."
10909898,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goal of our proposal is to answer the clinically significant question: Does a fragile X
premutation (PM; an allele of 55-200 CGG repeats in the X-linked FMR1 gene) pose a significant risk to
childhood development? Why is this important? At least one in 300 women in the US carries a PM allele.
Because most of these alleles are small and not prone to large expansions, nearly half of children born to
these women will inherit a PM, whereas fewer than 6% will inherit a full mutation (>200 repeats), the allele that
causes fragile X syndrome. PM alleles are known to increase the risk for two late-onset disorders: fragile X
associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI).
Adults with a PM allele who do not have FXTAS or FXPOI are still reported to have executive skill and working
memory deficits, visuospatial weakness and poor math skills, anxiety, and depression. For children who carry a
PM, there is a significant gap in our knowledge. Some reports find higher rates of developmental delay,
attention deficits, autism, and anxiety among children with a PM versus non-carriers, but these reports are
limited by ascertainment bias and small sample size. We hypothesize that the toxic effect of a PM can manifest
early in life, leading to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes and we propose to test this rigorously and
thoroughly. To address this gap in knowledge, we have an outstanding opportunity to study a large cohort of
children, now age 3 -12 years, who were identified prospectively: specifically, 582 children with a PM and 958
non-carriers, all identified when their carrier mothers underwent prenatal diagnosis for a fragile X mutation.
This unique cohort of children has minimal potential for ascertainment bias. In Aim 1, parents will complete
online questionnaires to describe their child’s general health and history of diagnosed neurodevelopmental
problems and to detail—using standardized questionnaires—the child’s behavior, executive skills, and social
relatedness. In Aim 2, a subset of school-aged participants who live in the mid-Atlantic region will be assessed
individually primarily via remote-administered semi-structured interview and neuropsychological measures
examining cognitive, academic, social and psychological function. Mothers will also complete questionnaires
regarding their own psychological well-being and parenting stress. We will evaluate all phenotypes with
respect to sex, CGG repeat length, and repeat structure to gain insight into the mechanisms and associated
risks (Aim 3). Our primary hypothesis is that children with a PM have a higher frequencies of
neurodevelopmental deficits than non-carrier children, stratified by sex. The combination of parental report and
direct assessment will provide a comprehensive evaluation of cognitive and behavioral skills. This will result in
a powerful combination of detailed phenotypic and genetic information that will unambiguously define the risk
of adverse childhood development posed by a PM allele."
10868729,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an important public health problem in people with HIV (PWH).
PWH have 3-fold the odds of COPD as uninfected people after adjusting for smoking. Acute exacerbations of
COPD (AECOPD) are the principal contributor to COPD morbidity and mortality. Given the adverse effects of
AECOPD, international practice guidelines for the prevention and management of AECOPD exist in the general
population. Limited evidence suggests that HIV infection is associated with increased risk for AECOPD, but data
on the effect of HIV infection on post-AECOPD outcomes are lacking. We also lack data on quality of COPD
care or the relationship between processes of care and outcomes in PWH. Scientific aims of this K08 are to
determine: 1) risk factors for AECOPD in PWH and uninfected people; 2) the effect of HIV infection on outcomes
after AECOPD; 3) the effect of HIV infection on COPD treatment concordance with guidelines and the relation-
ship between COPD care quality and outcomes in PWH. Hypotheses: 1) HIV infection, “traditional” AECOPD
risk factors, and HIV-specific factors are associated with AECOPD with interaction effects between age, smoking,
and poorly controlled HIV infection that enhance susceptibility to AECOPD; 2) HIV infection is associated with
increased readmissions and mortality after AECOPD; 3) guideline-concordant tests and therapies are underpre-
scribed in PWH compared to uninfected people and high-quality COPD care is associated with improved out-
comes in PWH. We will test our hypotheses in a cohort study of HIV-infected and uninfected controls with ad-
ministrative and electronic health record (EHR) data from health systems across the US in a causal inference
framework using nested case-control sampling to randomly select controls and inverse probability treatment
weighting for analysis, thus emulating a target trial with HIV infection as “treatment.” Data from this study will lay
the groundwork for the candidate’s future R01 proposals to assess patient adherence to COPD therapies and to
test interventions to optimize COPD care at the patient, provider, and system level. Through an integrated train-
ing plan of intensive mentorship, didactic coursework, experiential research, and academic activities, the candi-
date will accomplish his career development goals to develop expertise in: 1) health informatics and data science
for analysis of administrative and EHR data; 2) hierarchical and longitudinal statistical modeling; 3) causal infer-
ence from observational data; and 4) leadership, communication, and knowledge dissemination skills. The re-
sources and experiences of the candidate’s mentors (Drs. Alison Morris, Katie Suda, and Scott Rothenberger),
supportive research environment at the University of Pittsburgh, and strong institutional commitment from the
Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine assure the successful execution of the proposed
research and training activities and the candidate’s transition into an independent comparative effectiveness and
health services investigator developing effective management strategies for high-quality COPD care in PWH."
10834069,"ABSTRACT
Globally and in Vietnam, people who inject drugs (PWID) are disproportionately impacted by the HIV epidemic.
PWID have considerably lower levels of care engagement and experience worse HIV outcomes than
individuals with HIV who do not inject drugs. Efforts to scale-up HIV testing and treatment have largely failed to
reach PWID, who experience unique barriers to care. Even fewer of these evidence-based interventions (EBIs)
have been normalized (the process by which an intervention is integrated into routine clinic care) and
sustained, resulting in significant losses of time and resources. The success of EBI implementation and
sustainment is affected by clinic characteristics, which can act as important implementation barriers or
facilitators. However, the ways in which clinic characteristics are related to EBI fit, normalization, and
sustainment are poorly understood. The proposed fellowship builds on the applicant’s prior background to
prepare her for a career as an independent mixed methods researcher and implementation scientist. The
specific fellowship goals are for the applicant to 1) develop a strong foundation in conducting HIV-related
implementation science research; 2) build advanced quantitative analysis skills in analyzing and interpreting
statistical models; 3) expand her expertise in conducting mixed methods research and analysis; and 4) deepen
her skills in presenting research findings and grantsmanship. These goals will be accomplished through
coursework, mentorship from the sponsor and mentorship team, and execution of the proposed research
project. The proposed mixed methods research will be completed within the context of a larger NIDA-funded
cluster randomized implementation trial with 42 HIV testing sites in 10 provinces in Vietnam (Scaling up HPTN
074: a Cluster Randomized Implementation Trial of an EBI for Antiretroviral Therapy for PWID in Vietnam,
5R01DA047876-02). This study will identify key clinic characteristics for scale-up and sustainment of the
systems navigation and psychosocial counseling (SNaP) EBI in Vietnam, and examine how adaptations to
both the intervention and implementation strategies influence sustainment of SNaP. Aim 1 will use qualitative
interviews conducted with participant PWID (n=36) and clinic staff (n=24-36), survey data collected at baseline
and endline, and the modified Delphi method (to improve scale-up measurement) with US and Vietnamese
experts in HIV and implementation science to identify factors influencing clinic scale-up success of SNaP. Aim
2 will use clinic staff surveys across the 42 sites to evaluate sustainment of SNaP and clinic-level factors
associated with sustainment. Aim 3 will involve 24-36 qualitative interviews with clinic staff and directors to
determine how intervention and implementation strategy adaptations and clinic characteristics influence SNaP
normalization and sustainment. The proposed research aligns with NIDA’s goals of bridging the research-to-
practice gap by providing evidence-informed guidance to Ministries of Health in Vietnam for optimizing scale-
up and sustainment of SNaP, which has the potential to increase wellbeing for PWID with HIV globally."
10830307,"This proposal will optimize NAD functions in the metabolism of fracture tissues for the enhancement of
bone fracture repair in an obesity/Type-2 diabetic condition, a condition that is common in the general
population and even more frequent among veterans. It is well established that Type-2 diabetics suffer from
impaired bone healing caused by an insufficient metabolic response to the requirements of tissue repair. In
this study, an obesity/Type-2 diabetes condition will be induced in mice and the redox potential of local
tissues improved through the augmentation of NAMPT functions in the fracture tissues. Selected agonists of
NAMPT will be screened for their effects in periosteal cells, therapeutic candidates locally applied to the
fracture tissues in obesity/Type-2 diabetic mice and fracture healing evaluated. The completion of the
proposed studies should facilitate the development of novel therapeutic interventions that improve tissue
responses to the metabolic requirements of wound repair."
10821386,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Brain tissues from people living with HIV (PLWH) showed evidence of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)-like pathologies,
including increased neurotoxic amyloid-b (Ab40/42), amyloid plaques and Tau hyperphosphorylation (pTau)
associated with neurodegeneration and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). The mechanisms
through which HIV increase Ab, pTau, and induce AD-like central nervous system (CNS) impairment are not
known. Although most PLWH with CNS Ab plaques and pTau had been on long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART),
the role of ART in pTau and Ab production, and AD-like pathologies has not been investigated. Findings from
our R21 studies, using in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo approaches, demonstrated that HIV-1 significantly increased
CNS Ab42 and pTau in humanized mice, and this was associated with significantly 1) increased expression and
activation/activity of b-secretase-1 (BACE1), soluble (s)APPb (amyloidogenic pathway effectors), and GSK3b
(kinase that phosphorylates Tau); 2) reduced expression/activity of neprilysin (NEP, Ab-degrading enzyme); 3)
increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) expression of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE,
mediates Ab CNS influx), and reduced BBB expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor–related protein-1
(LRP1, mediates CNS Ab efflux); and 4) increased neuroinflammation, neuronal damage and BBB injury. We
demonstrated that LRP1 and CCR5 mediated Ab transport through the BBB, that AZT potentiated HIV-induced
upregulation/activation of BACE1, sAPPb and GSK3b, and that AZT blocked NEP expression/activity.
Significantly, the CCR5 antagonist maraviroc (MVC) abrogated these HIV- and AZT- induced effects.
Thus, we hypothesize that CCR5, via LRP1, plays a major role in Ab formation, transport, and catabolism,
amyloidogenesis and pTau in PLWH, and that targeting CCR5 prevents HIV-induced Ab and pTau,
increases Ab CNS efflux, and abrogates CNS injury and HAND. Using a validated HIV/AIDS animal model,
primary human cells and human brain tissues, we will test this hypothesis and further investigate the effects of
commonly prescribed antiretroviral (ARV) drugs (AZT, TDF) on HIV-induced activation of BACE1 and APP
amyloidogenic pathway, Tau metabolism, and CNS injury (Aim-1); Ab transport, degradation, clearance, and
neuroinflammation (Aim-2); and associated BBB transcriptomic and epigenomic signatures (Aim-3). These
mechanistic studies will help determine whether HIV induces amyloidogenesis by i) activating BACE1 pathways
to increase Ab production or ii) by interfering with LRP1-mediated Ab transport, degradation, clearance; iii) the
role of ARVs; iv) whether CCR5 modulates these effects; and v) characterize the brain vascular transcriptome
and epigenome associated with HIV/ARVs-induced dysregulation and MVC protective effects. Our proposed
studies are of high-impact, translational significance, and address the NIH high priority research areas that focus
on “Examining the pathophysiologic mechanisms of HIV-induced CNS dysfunction in the setting of ART…and
development of novel therapeutic approaches to mitigate CNS complications of HIV infection.”"

Nearly a million Americans suffer from meniscus tears every year, and 80% of patients who undergo partial or
total meniscus removal subsequently develop pain, transient effusion, and knee osteoarthritis. Currently,
meniscal allograft transplantation (MAT) with human cadaver tissues is considered medically necessary for
treatments with symptomatic post meniscectomy knees with major meniscus loss. Although MAT enables
favorable outcomes in the long term, the challenge of donor-recipient size-matching strongly limits broad
implementation of MAT since ineffective preservation techniques restrict the number of available fresh grafts.
Our ultimate, long-term objective is to maintain cell viability, tissue structure and biomechanical integrity of
meniscal allografts for the purpose of long-term storage, thereby overcoming the size-matching challenge. Our
previous studies have demonstrated that ice-free cryopreservation by vitrification combined with nanowarming
is a promising preservation method for preserving living cells and matrix structure in large avascular tissues.
However, this method has encountered critical challenges when applied to meniscal tissues, the major hurdle
being the transport limitation of cryoprotectant (CPA) molecules in the meniscus. The large and complex
meniscal structure and ECM composition prevents uniform distribution of CPA throughout the tissue, thereby
causing ice crystal formation during cooling, which damages living cells and tissue structure. To overcome the
CPA transport limitation, two critical knowledge gaps need to be filled: 1) location-specific mass transport
mechanism of CPA molecules in the whole meniscus, 2) location-specific effects of CPA concentration and
exposure time (CPA toxicity) on meniscal viability. Herein, we hypothesize that meniscal allografts loaded with
adequate and toxically tolerable CPAs can be preserved without the loss of viability and functionality by
vitrification integrated with nanowarming compared to conventionally cryopreserved allografts. Specifically, we
aim to 1) determine location-specific porcine meniscal structure- and composition-dependent CPA transport
properties in the whole porcine meniscus, 2) investigate location-specific effects of CPA concentration and
exposure time on meniscal viability and optimize both parameters to achieve optimal viability after vitrification,
and 3) evaluate in vivo functionality of vitrified meniscal allografts in a 4-month preclinical transplant study using
a porcine model. Collectively, these aims will demonstrate our concept that the vitrification method can be used
to preserve living cells and tissue structures in meniscal allografts in a pig model. Future work will combine the
developed methodologies and our computational model to optimize viability of human meniscal allografts after
CPA addition and vitrification to identify the optimal CPA loading and vitrification protocol for each donor graft.
Further, by incorporating patient-specific meniscus anatomies and morphology, this work will break therapeutic
limitations in meniscal replacement."

Proximal humerus fractures (PHFs) are the third most common fracture in the elderly, with an estimated 200,000
occurring each year in the United States. PHFs can lead to pain, poor shoulder function, plus short and long-
term disability for patients. Substantial controversy persists regarding initial treatment for elderly adults with this
injury. PHFs can be managed conservatively or surgically and great controversy exists over which patients
should be treated surgically. A unique challenge with PHFs is that they have variable presentation and range in
complexity. Unlike the management of other major joint fractures, the initial treatment choice for PHF is highly
dependent on the fracture characteristics. Treatment effectiveness evidence is needed to guide clinical care for
individual patients with PHF. The Neer Classification, first developed in 1970, is the most widely used framework
to describe and classify PHFs. Although the Neer Classification is the most widely used in practice, it is outdated,
incomplete, often incorrectly applied, and suffers from poor interobserver reliability. The absence of a universally
accepted, standardized fracture classification system is a critical barrier in the development of treatment
effectiveness evidence for PHF. The application of deep learning (DL) computational models can automate and
standardize the fracture classification process and identify all relevant fracture characteristics. DL image analysis
models have been shown to be highly accurate at identifying features of interest on diagnostic images. An
automated, standardized PHF classification system will enhance our ability to universally standardize fracture
classification across all orthopaedic clinical care settings, improve the precision and efficiency in fracture care
and generate treatment effectiveness evidence to guide clinical practice. The overall objective for this application,
is to develop and validate a DL computational model capable of identifying fracture features using X-ray images.
Our central hypothesis is that we can develop a DL model that will be as accurate as expert shoulder specialists
in identifying important fracture features on X-ray images. In Aim 1 we will modify the Neer Classification
framework for fracture feature identification. Aim 2 will be the development of a gold standard dataset for deep
learning DL fracture feature identification, and finally Aim 3 will be the training and testing of a DL model to
identify fracture features on X-rays."

Polycomb group (PcG) proteins play critical roles in maintaining epigenetic memory of gene silencing in normal
development and human diseases. PcG proteins function in two enzymatic multi-subunit complexes: Polycomb
repressive complex 1 and 2 (PRC1 and 2). PRC1 deposits monoubiquitin to lysine 119 on histone H2A (H2Aub)
whereas PRC2 methylates all states of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me1/2/3). How Polycomb domains are
reprogrammed during mammalian preimplantation development remains largely unknown. Recent advances on
low input epigenomic profiling techniques make it feasible to investigate chromatin dynamics in mammalian
preimplantation embryos. The discovery that non-canonical H3K27me3 in oocytes can mediate germline DNA
methylation-independent genomic imprinting has raised several important questions on Polycomb domain
regulation in early development. For example, whether H2Aub follows a similar reprogramming dynamic as
H3K27me3, what’s the role of PRC1/2 in regulating 3D chromatin, and whether PRC1/2 form a positive feedback
loop to reinforce each other during preimplantation development. To address these questions, I have generated
preliminary data showing that, in contrast to conventional view that H2Aub and H3K27me3 are largely co-
localized, H2Aub and H3K27me3 undergo genome-wide distinct reprogramming dynamics after fertilization. In
addition, H2Aub deposition by PRC1 is independent of PRC2 in oocytes and preimplantation embryos,
suggesting a more critical role of PRC1 than PRC2 during this developmental window. Built on the unexpected
observations, I propose to use a combination of low input epigenomics, bioinformatics, and rapid protein
degradation approach to understand mechanisms and functions of PRC1/2 as well as the chromatin
modifications they respectively deposit in mouse preimplantation development. In Aim 1 (K99 phase), I will
identify mechanisms underlying the distinct reprogramming dynamics of H2Aub and H3K27me3 after fertilization.
In Aim 2 (K99 phase), I will rapidly degrade PRC1 in zygotes to assess its impact on zygotic genome activation,
PRC2 recruitment, and 3D chromatin structures. I will be trained by Drs. Yi Zhang (Boston Children’s
Hospital/Harvard Medical School), Peter Park (Harvard Medical School), and Bin Gu (Michigan State University)
to establish low input epigenomic profiling tools, biochemical assays, computational pipelines, and the rapid
protein degradation technique. In Aim 3 (R00 phase), I will take advantage of the techniques and computational
pipelines established during the K99 phase to study the role of variant PRC1 subcomplexes in preimplantation
development. The NIH K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award, together with the outstanding research
environment at BCH/HMS will facilitate my completion of the proposed work and transition to an independent
investigator. Collectively, completion of these aims will reveal mechanisms underlying PcG recruitment, define
the role of PcG-mediated gene silencing in mouse preimplantation development, and uncover new paradigms
on chromatin reprogramming during mammalian gamete-to-embryo transition."

 Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a prevalent, enduring and disabling psychiatric condition found
in approximately 2% to 5.9% of the population [1, 2] and 20% of hospitalized psychiatric patients. Suicide
rates of approximately 10% have been reported [3]. One of the most prominent clinical features of BPD is
extreme mood shifts [4-6] occurring in response to external social/emotional events [7-9]. The emotional
instability in BPD contributes to many of the most disabling, even life-threatening, symptoms of the disorder,
including suicidality, outbursts of intense anger, and seriously impaired role functioning [10]. The severity of the
BPD symptom profile, its prevalence, chronicity and high burden upon health care services [11-13] make the
development of effective and accessible treatment for BPD a high priority. Yet there is no current medication
treatment indicated for BPD and the psychotherapies recognized for the disorder have been shown to have
small effect sizes and are of limited availability.
 The present study builds upon work by our group that has shown that deficiencies in the ability to
regulate emotion by engaging typically adaptive cognitive strategies (cognitive reappraisal, CR) and to
effectively activate associated neural systems can be corrected by focused training in CR. The R61 phase of
this study examines a manualized intensive training program in CR, tests that it effects target neural systems
implicated in emotional processing and enhances behavioral reappraisal success. It examines 2-, 4- and 6-
weeks of twice a week treatment to identify the optimal dose. Measures include fMRI imaging and clinical
ratings at baseline and each of these subsequent time points. Upon demonstrating that CR training is superior
to a control condition in enhancing performance in the neural target at one or more of these dose durations, we
will proceed to the R33 phase.
 In the R33 phase we will treat a larger sample of BPD patients at the optimal dose defined in the R61
phase to 1) demonstrate reproducibility of the R61 findings, 2) to demonstrate that CR training is superior to
control in improving BPD clinical outcomes at the end of treatment and at 1- and 4- month follow-up, and 3)
that change in activity at the neural targets is associated with clinical improvement.
 The results of this study can support the introduction of CR training as a new psychosocial approach for
the treatment of BPD, either as stand-alone treatment or as an augmenting strategy. It may, moreover, have
application to a range of psychiatric disorders characterized by severe emotional instability."

 Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are a type of functional neurological disorder (FND)
characterized by seizure-like symptoms without EEG correlates. PNES is severely debilitating to children and
families, making this a significant clinical and societal burden. Recent research has revealed catastrophic
symptom expectations and sense of control as potential targets for pediatric PNES treatment. Children with
PNES have greater catastrophic symptom expectations, or the interpretation of physical sensations as
injurious, intense and disturbing, than their siblings and peers with epilepsy. Catastrophic symptom
expectations such as these have been found to actually induce the expected symptom. Also, children do not
have a sense of control over PNES symptoms, indicating that children perceive PNES to be involuntary and
uncontrollable. In adults, studies using cognitive behavioral therapy or SSRIs to target mood and anxiety have
demonstrated no significant reduction in PNES compared to control conditions. In a different cognitive
behavioral approach, the aim of this study is to assess sense of control and catastrophic symptom
expectations as treatment targets of Retraining and Control Therapy (ReACT), a novel cognitive behavioral
treatment for pediatric PNES developed by the PI. Our recently published RCT demonstrated a significant
decrease in PNES frequency after ReACT, and increased sense of control was significantly related to reduced
PNES frequency in children with PNES. In the R61 phase, nine to 18-year olds diagnosed with PNES will
engage in 12 sessions of ReACT. Sense of control over actions will be measured by the magic and turbulence
task, and catastrophic symptom expectations will be measured by cortisol response to the cold pressor task 7
days before treatment and 7 days after the 8th and 12th treatment sessions (to evaluate treatment dose). PNES
outcomes will be measured by number of PNES in the 30 days before and after treatment. The study will
proceed to the R33 phase if Go criteria are met (Cohen's d effect size ≥ 0.5) for engagement of one of the
targets. For the R33, children will be randomized to either ReACT or an active therapy (supportive therapy),
and outcomes will be measured 7 days before and after treatment and 6 months after treatment. The
replication of target engagement will be assessed as compared to supportive therapy, and the extent to which
the change in the targets is associated with change in PNES frequency will be determined. The preliminary
signal of efficacy for ReACT on PNES will be evaluated to prepare for a larger multicenter RCT assessing the
efficacy of ReACT on pediatric PNES."

10708896,"Background: It is estimated that about half of the 9 million Veterans who receive care at Veterans Health
Administration (VHA) have chronic pain, of which chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a major type. Veterans with
CLBP are high healthcare utilizers and are experiencing a dramatic shift in care – from a medical approach
that relied on medications like opioids for pain management to a biopsychosocial approach in which evidence -
based, lower risk non-pharmacological options are favored. Non-pharmacological interventions, which include
complementary and integrative health (CIH) treatments, are now a first line of care. Consequently, Veterans
need to be able to access these treatments, but they are complex to deliver and difficult to provide in real-world
settings. Thus, non-pharmacological treatments for CLBP need to not only be effective, but also low cost,
easy-to-administer, accessible, and acceptable to Veterans and to their providers.
Significance: Our long-term goal is to improve chronic pain management for Veterans with CLBP by
integrating an effective self-administered acupressure intervention into VHA using current structures that
support Veteran-centered care. The proposed project is a crucial first step. It directly addresses priorities from
VA, HSR&D, and CARA legislation that seek to provide greater access to non-opioid options for chronic pain,
including CIH treatments like acupressure.
Innovation and Impact: This project leverages the unique infrastructure within VHA to test and deliver
interventions that could have system-wide uptake. Self-administered acupressure is an ideal intervention to
test using the existing VHA support structure for CIH treatments, the Whole Health System. Self-administered
acupressure is a promising candidate for uptake at VHA given its low risk and ability to be performed at home
at any time. In addition to providing evidence that can inform VA clinical practice guidelines for low back pain
on effectiveness of self-administered acupressure for CLBP, this project will also inform on how to begin to
implement this treatment at VHA, which would support the recent CIH Directive that outlines processes for how
to integrate CIH treatments for Veterans.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Determine effectiveness of a 6-week self-administered acupressure protocol on pain
interference, disability, fatigue, and sleep post intervention, and [sustained effects at 10 weeks] and 2)
Evaluate supports and barriers for implementation of self -administered acupressure to Veterans with CLBP.
Methodology: A Type 1 effectiveness-implementation hybrid study will be conducted at three VA sites: Ann
Arbor VA Medical Center, Toledo Community-Based Outpatient Clinic, and Flint Community-Based Outpatient
Clinic. There will be 300 Veterans recruited from providers at these sites and through classes offered through
the Whole Health System, an initiative designed to teach Veterans how to self-manage aspects of their health.
Participants who are randomized into the stimulating acupressure arm will be compared to participants
randomized into a wait list control group and implementation factors will be measured quantitatively and
qualitatively. This work is guided by dissemination frameworks, engaging stakeholders, measuring fidelity,
considering site characteristics, and assessing facilitators and barriers to implementation.
Next Steps/Implementation: This study contributes to the knowledge base of self -administered acupressure
as a treatment for symptoms in CLBP, extending the state of the research beyond efficacy studies. It fills a gap
in knowledge about effectiveness and how to best implement self-administered acupressure. This project will
provide critical information that can increase the ability to access a patient-preferred, non-opioid pain
treatment. If self-administered acupressure is effective, next steps would be to test implementation across
several VA sites in different regions and more comprehensively examine facilitators and barriers considering
geographical and cultural differences in Veterans across the country."
10931353,"The overall goal of the MD Anderson Cancer Center SPORE in Ovarian Cancer is to test and translate novel
therapeutic strategies, including those to overcome adaptive resistance to conventional cytotoxic
chemotherapy, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi), anti-angiogenic agents (bevacizumab)
and immune checkpoint blockade. Over the last five years, 1,417 new patients with ovarian cancer received
care at MD Anderson. We have prioritized ovarian cancer research through recruitment, salary support,
clinical facilities, laboratory space, and philanthropic funds. Philanthropic support from the MD Anderson
Ovarian Cancer Moon Shot has provided organization and infrastructure, but the work in the SPORE is
completely distinct. We successfully implemented measures to increase the recruitment of women and
underrepresented minorities to our Developmental Research Program (DRP) and Career Enhancement
Program (CEP). Over the last 22 years, our SPORE investigators have contributed over 1280 manuscripts
regarding ovarian cancer with 155 in the last four years. Our SPORE has made significant contributions
including: 1) conducted the SPORE and EDRN-supported Normal Risk Ovarian Screening Study (NROSS)
where 71% of cases have been detected in stage I or II; 2) identified biomarkers that detect 18% of CA125
negative cases; 3) developed a 4-biomarker algorithm that in retrospect detects advanced stage disease
1.4 to 4.8 years earlier than the CA125-based NROSS algorithm; 4) found anti-TP53 autoantibodies
elevated 8 months before CA125 and 22 months before diagnosis; 5) observed a 54% objective response
rate to anti-angiogenic therapy with aflibercept and docetaxel; 6) completed a trial targeting Dll4; 7)
demonstrated that CSF1R inhibitors can deplete macrophages and reduce resistance to anti-VEGF
therapy; 8) demonstrated significant activity of the MEK inhibitor selumetinib in low-grade ovarian cancers
and completed an international phase III trial of another potent MEK inhibitor trametinib; and 9) developed
a robust biomarker panel that predicts response to PARPi and initiation of multiple trials combining PI3K
and PARPi in high-grade ovarian cancer. In the proposed SPORE, Project 1 and Project 4 investigators
tackle therapeutic resistance to PARP inhibitors and immune checkpoint blockers from multiple directions
to speed progress and improve outcomes for women with ovarian cancer. Both projects have the potential
to enhance T-cell infiltration in tumors and impart immunologic memory, which is particularly important given
the likelihood of this cancer to recur. In Project 2, we will develop a novel TROP2-targeted CAR-NK therapy.
In Project 3, we will develop therapy aimed at the tumor microenvironment using a novel EGFL6 targeted
monoclonal antibody. Overall, our translational studies conducted in an optimal environment with a multi-
institutional team are directed toward improving clinical outcomes of women with ovarian cancer."
10931355,"Ovarian cancer is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality that affects nearly 300,000 women worldwide
each year. Its poor outcomes relate to delayed diagnosis and development of resistance to conventional therapy
with carboplatin and paclitaxel. In the last SPORE cycle, we evaluated a novel inhibitor of salt-induced kinase 2
(SIK2) GRN-300 that enhances sensitivity to both carboplatin and paclitaxel. With the support of the SPORE,
we carried out a first-in-human phase IA/B trial to define the maximum tolerated dose of GRN-300 alone and in
combination with weekly paclitaxel. We also conducted preclinical studies to demonstrate that GRN-300
enhanced olaparib sensitivity in homologous recombination (HR)-proficient and deficient ovarian cancer cell lines
and xenografts. We have demonstrated that GRN-300 enhances olaparib sensitivity by 1) abolishing the class
IIa histone deacetylase 4/5/7-associated transcriptional activity of myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D), 2)
decreasing MEF2D binding to regulatory regions with high chromatin accessibility in DNA repair genes, and 3)
repressing critical gene expression in the DNA repair pathway. Whereas poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors
(PARPi) have played a large part in maintaining progression-free survival in patients with HR-deficient ovarian
cancers, the majority of patients will have resistance to PARPi and experience relapse. Moreover, combining
conventional or other targeted agents with PARPi has been limited by additive myelosuppression. To date, GRN-
300 has had no significant marrow toxicity in our phase I clinical trial. GRN-300 enhanced olaparib activity in
both olaparib-sensitive and acquired olaparib-resistant ovarian cancer cells. Cancer immunotherapy, including
immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), has shown great promise for cancers at multiple sites, but the frequency
and duration of response of ovarian cancer has been limited. Recent studies suggest that a deficiency in DNA
repair is associated with increased response of cancer cells to immunotherapy. We have found that GRN-300
increases phosphorylation of TBK1 and nuclear localization of IRF3 in murine ovarian cancer cells. Both TBK1
and IRF3 are downstream targets of the cGAS/STING pathway. GRN-300 or GRN-300 combined with olaparib
increases the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in human and murine ovarian cancer cells.
GRN-300 combined with anti-PD-L1 enhances CD8+ T-cell infiltration and antitumor activity in a syngeneic
ovarian cancer model. The goal of our project is to determine whether GRN-300 overcomes resistance to PARPi
and enhances PARPi sensitivity and whether GRN-300 promotes adaptive T-cell function and enhances immune
checkpoint therapy. We will pursue three aims: 1) to perform a phase IB trial of GRN-300 in combination with a
PARPi, 2) To determine the underlying mechanisms of olaparib resistance that can be overcome with the SIK2
inhibitor GRN-300 in combination with olaparib in ovarian cancer cell lines, xenografts and PDXs, and 3) To
identify the mechanism(s) by which the SIK2 inhibitor GRN-300 sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to ICB and
enhances T-cell cytotoxicity."

We seek to strengthen and enhance the Integrative Center for Environmental Microbiomes and Human Health
(ICEMHH). Our center was established in response to the 2016 announcement of the National Microbiome
Initiative (NMI). The NMI was conceived through the recognition that humans are both connected to and reliant
upon the microbial communities that constitute the Earth’s microbiomes, in the environment as well as the
human body. The NIH plays a central role in funding this effort, “with a particular emphasis on multi-ecosystem
comparison studies, and investigation into the design of new tools to explore and understand microbiomes”
[NIH Human Microbiome Project]. The focus of the ICEMHH is the interface between the microbial
environment and human health, and our research includes clinical, biochemistry and landscape ecology
studies. The University of Hawaiʻi brings three compelling strengths to microbiome research: the uniquely
tractable and environmentally complexed landscape of the Hawaiian Islands, an exceptionally qualified biology
faculty, including an integrated cohort of junior microbiome-focused faculty, and a dedication to the diversity of
people that live on the Islands. As the most diverse biome on Earth, Hawaiʻi offers the unique opportunity to
study the effects of steep, orthogonal, ecological gradients on human health, vis a vis their microbial
symbionts, from mountain to sea, and in both urban and rural settings. The proposed projects aim to address
how environmental variables influence microbial assembly, and how, in turn, this impacts host and human
health. Our research leverages the natural ecological complexity and phylogenetic diversity of our archipelago
to understand the interplay between environmental microbiomes and human health within natural settings.
Using invertebrate model hosts and clinical research, we disentangle the mechanisms underlying these
landscape-level patterns. Our projects build upon the knowledge, infrastructure and resources developed in
Phase 1 to grow center renown, sustainability and capacity. Our long-term goal is that ICEMHH serve as a
world-class model for linking environmental microbiology with human health sciences. In this way, the Center
will provide lasting contributions to the State of Hawaiʻi, and beyond."
10890809,"PROJECT SUMMARY –Microscopy Imaging Center for Research through Observation (MICRO)
Advanced microscopy is a fundamental tool in biology that allows scientists to visualize and characterize

microdissection and optical tweezers. Dr. Alexander Culley, an expert in microbiology and virology, will be the
Project Leader during Phase 2. One goal will be to modernize and replace aging equipment, add an image
analysis workstation, incorporate histology for light microscopy, and develop training modules. An area of focus
will be to introduce users to emerging imaging and data analysis techniques, in particular rapidly evolving
fluorescence-imaging technologies to advance studies of microorganisms and their microbiomes. Webinars
and workshops led by experts in the new technologies will be tailored to the needs of MICRO users. The
MICRO Core will continue to be available to researchers across the UHM campus, other local research and
educational institutions, and visiting scientists. The MICRO Core will support and broaden the research

10890815,"PROJECT SUMMARY - Insectary for Scientific Training and Advances in Research (InSTAR)
Invertebrates provide excellent model systems to study the interactions between hosts and their microbiota.
These invertebrate models advance our understanding of the impact of microbial symbionts on host
development, metabolism, immune function, and overall system health, and produce generalizable information
that informs human health. In addition, the symbiotic microbes of invertebrates have direct impacts on public
health as microbial symbionts influence the survival, development, cellular function, and immunity of pest
species and disease vectors that contribute significantly to the global public health burden. The central
objective of this proposal is to further develop a core facility that will enable the use of arthropods to study the
environmental microbiome at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa. During Phase 1, the InSTAR established a
unique collection of laboratory colonies for medically relevant mosquito vectors and Hawaiian Drosophila
species, and established the only BSL-2/ACL-2 space to work with potentially dangerous insects in a
laboratory setting in the state of Hawai‘i. The core also provided critical infrastructure for three former RPLs,
and continues to support the independent research programs for two of those RPLs. During the next cycle of
this CoBRE award, the InSTAR will i) provide infrastructure to support the research of two new Phase II RPLs,
ii) establish a greater diversity of insect models in colony, with a special focus on Hawaiian Drosophila sp., iii)
establish space to utilize for rearing only to allow a greater diversity of research activities in the non-rearing
sections of the InSTAR core, and iv) coordinate with State, Federal, and academic groups to expand the
InSTAR’s user base. Over the long term, the core will continue to facilitate medical entomology in the State of
Hawai‘i, increasing the capacity to respond to public health threats imposed by invertebrates. In addition, it will
promote research toward developing new model systems focusing on unique native Hawaiian invertebrate
species, and serve as a resource that facilitates access to Hawaii‘s unique biodiversity to the global research

10899771,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glucuronidation is often the source of unfavorable pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics that lead to the
failure of drugs during clinical trials, and as such, there is a critical need in drug development for a tool to
control glucuronidation. Our long-term goal is to develop strategies to control glucuronidation by limiting its
substrate availability. To do this, we will determine the allosteric mechanism that controls human UDP-glucose
dehydrogenase (hUGDH), the enzyme that produces the essential substrate for glucuronidation. In our
previous grant, we discovered how the 30-residue intrinsically disordered C-terminus (the ID-tail) modifies the
structure of the enzyme to favor binding of the feedback inhibitor UDP-Xyl, a downstream metabolite. We also
discovered a cryptic allosteric site for inhibiting the enzyme. Briefly, the feedback inhibitor UDP-Xylose
competes with substrate for the active site; upon binding, UDP-Xyl induces the enzyme to slowly isomerize into
an inactive complex called EW. The allosteric transition converts the active site into two novel allosteric sites
called SBSW and NBSW. The SBSW site is specific for the UDP-Xyl inhibitor, but the NBSW site can bind either
UDP-Xyl or the substrate UDP-Glc. We hypothesize that the NBSW and SBSW allosteric sites cooperatively
stabilize EW, and the dual-specificity of the NBSW is an important feature that allows the abundant substrate
UDP-Glc to enhance the binding affinity of the less abundant inhibitor UDP-Xyl in the SBSW. This hypothesis is
based on our preliminary data that (i) the substrate UDP-Glc can bind to the NBSW site and inhibit hUGDH, and
(ii) the inhibitor UDP-Xyl can bind to both the SBSW and NBSW to inhibit. This hypothesis will be tested by the
following specific aims: 1) we will determine how the NBSW and SBSW allosteric sites interact to enhance the
allosteric inhibition by UDP-Xyl; 2) we will determine the relationship between a putative low barrier hydrogen
bond (LBHB) and the stability of the NBSW and SBSW allosteric sites; and 3) we will identify the structural
features that couple the intrinsically disordered C-terminus (ID-tail) of hUGDH to the favorable formation of EW.
The research proposed in this application is innovative because it focuses on the allosteric inhibition of hUGDH
as a global mechanism for controlling glucuronidation, and uses our recent discoveries of: (i) the novel NBSW
allosteric site; (ii) a putitive low barrier hydrogen bond in the allosteric mechanism; and (iii) the entropic force
generated by the intrinsically disordered C-terminus. Since these features are recent discoveries from my lab,
this research is distinct from previous attempts that tried to control glucuronidation. The expected outcomes of
this work are significant. A detailed description of the allosteric mechanism of hUGDH will serve as a
foundation for the design of a class of allosteric inhibitors that will act as global regulators of glucuronidation.
And more broadly, because of the persistence of long (>30 residues) intrinsically disordered segments in the
human proteome, (>44% of all human proteins), learning how the entropic force generated by the disordered
terminus of hUGDH modifies the protein function will have a broad impact."

Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) face increased levels of adversity and higher rates of trauma, suicide,
and mortality compared to their housed peers. Adversity is associated with negative long-term psychological
and physiological outcomes including impaired mental health and dysregulated stress systems. However,
protective factors in this population are not well understood. Social network processes are a potentially
modifiable factor that may mitigate negative outcomes associated with adversity and may serve as an avenue
for future intervention. The overarching research goal of this study is to examine different risk profiles of YEH
and their association with psychological distress and physiological stress, and social network processes as
potential protective pathways. The aims will be addressed using a cross-sectional secondary analysis of the
baseline data from the randomized controlled trial, Housing, opportunities, motivation and engagement
(HOME) for homeless youth at-risk for opioid use disorder (#UG3/UH3DA050174, National Institute on Drug
Abuse). The specific aims of the proposed study are to (1) Examine the relationships between adversity
profiles and psychological distress (depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt) and physiological
stress (hair cortisol concentration [HCC]) (2) Examine the relationships between social network processes
(family/friend perceived satisfaction of support received, family/friend prosocial behavior) and psychological
distress and physiological stress and (3) Explore the extent to which social network processes moderate the
relationship between adversity and psychological distress and physiological stress. The baseline data from the
HOME study (N=240) contains information on youth demographics, adversity (childhood physical, sexual, and
emotional abuse, neglect, and street victimization), physiological stress (HCC as a measure of cumulative
stress), and psychological distress (depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt). Latent profile
analysis will be conducted to identify risk profiles of YEH who show differing adversity patterns and regression
analyses will be conducted to address the aims above. This proposal is responsive to the National Institute of
Nursing Research’s research priority of health prevention and promotion through the lens of social
determinants of health and health equity. This pre-doctoral training plan has the following goals: (1) Develop
statistical proficiency. (2) Advance understanding of stress physiology, social network processes, and their
relationship to each other across childhood, adolescence and young/emerging adulthood. (3) Cultivate skills
related to conducting mental health promotion research with historically marginalized populations. (4)
Advance skills for conducting independent research as nurse faculty at a research-intensive academic
institution. The proposed research and training plan will provide the applicant a foundation to a career in
nursing science as an early-stage investigator aimed at addressing health inequities and protective factors
within historically marginalized populations."

Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) technology for people with severe speech
and motor impairment (SSMI) continues to improve, with recent advances being made in the
neural control of communication devices. In prior NIDCD-supported research, our research
team developed a high-performance intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) that decodes
arm movement intentions directly from brain activity. This technology has allowed people with
SSMI to control a computer cursor with sufficient speed and accuracy to type at up to 8
words/min and has enabled full control of unmodified consumer devices using only decoded
motor cortical activity. In the proposed U01 clinical research, performed as part of the multi-site
BrainGate consortium, we will build upon decades of experience in studying the motor system in
humans and non-human primates, with the end goal of advancing iBCI technology. The goals of
this project are to study how speech is prepared and produced at the level of ensembles of
single neurons in speech-related motor areas of the brain in people with amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS), and to create a speech prosthesis that will allow communication at rates
approaching conversational speech (120-150 words per minute). We will approach these
investigations with a suite of advanced methods, including (1) newly-developed dynamical
systems computational approaches that have provided fundamental insights into the function of
the motor system, and (2) machine learning algorithms for decoding of movement intention and
language modeling that have formed the basis of the fastest communication prosthesis yet
reported. Finally, we will continue to evaluate the safety profile of Utah-array based iBCIs
through the ongoing BrainGate2 pilot clinical trial. Upon completion, this project will advance
both the capabilities of iBCIs for communication and our understanding of the detailed neural
mechanisms of speech production."
10691535,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Across the world, spondyloarthritis (SpA) is the most common form of juvenile arthritis, accounting for as many
as one-third of all cases. Since the introduction of biologic disease modifying agents such as tumor necrosis
factor inhibitors (TNFi), inactive disease is a realistic goal for children with spondyloarthritis (SpA). However,
side effects of TNFi include increased risk of infection, psoriasis, demyelinating disorders, and malignancy.
Additionally, TNFi are expensive and may adversely impact patient’s and caregiver’s quality of life and anxiety.
Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted numerous inquiries regarding whether being on a TNFi increased
the risk of becoming infected, and, if infected, whether being on a TNFi increased the risk of morbidity. In the
absence of definitive answers many families’ next question was, “Can we stop the medication?” We must
address two critical knowledge gaps to inform strategies for TNFi de-escalation in children with SpA. First, it is
unknown if subclinical imaging represents a risk for flare or whether it represents benign residual activity.
Presently, clinical equipoise exists in whether subclinical inflammation on pelvic MRI should impact treatment
decisions about children with SpA and axial disease because we do not know the prevalence or the clinical
relevance of these MRI findings. Second, the role of cellular biomarkers to predict flare after therapy de-
escalation in juvenile SpA is unknown. Prior studies in polyarticular juvenile arthritis have identified cellular
populations and biomarkers that can distinguish disease states that are highly associated with relapse. Similar
studies have not been done in juvenile SpA. Our objective is to test the association of immunologic, serologic
and imaging biomarkers with the risk of disease flare in children with SpA by leveraging the infrastructure and
resources of the parent trial, Biologic Abatement and Capturing Kids’ Outcomes and Flare Frequency in
Juvenile SpA (BACK-OFF JSpA) to perform mechanistic studies to address these critical knowledge gaps. This
application has 2 specific aims: 1) to test the ability of imaging biomarkers at the time of medication de-
escalation to predict subsequent flare in children with axial arthritis, and 2) to test the ability of cellular
biomarkers at the time of medication de-escalation to predict subsequent flare in all children with SpA. The
work proposed in this application will directly impact clinical care and significantly enhance the evidence base
that clinicians, families, and patients use to make decisions about whether or not to de-escalate biologic
therapy."
10931393,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cell behaviors and tissue developments often occur under spatial constraints (e.g.,
interstitial space, tissue lining, skull enclosure). The current in vitro systems are often
open cultures, and thus miss the spatial constraints and other in vivo stimuli. The
current in vivo models are often low throughput and hard-to-trace, therefore unable to
unravel the complex interplay between intrinsic influences (e.g., genetics/epigenetics)
and extrinsic ones (e.g., micro-environment). For example, cell membrane blebbing and
brain folding are fundamental and impactful bio-behaviors under spatial constraints.
Their biophysical and molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Lately, several
experimental and theoretical tools have emerged to fascinate the modeling of complex
bio-behaviors.
This proposed study aims to parameterize morphological information, relate to the
complex influences under spatial constraints, and unravel the mechanism of bio-
behaviors in the two exemplified areas. It will be done through a morphome platform
that integrates several experimental-theoretical tools (e.g., tissue-on-a-chip, data-driven
modeling, machine-learning), which has been pre-defined by PI and Co-Is. We hope to
1) fill the compelling gaps in our understanding of membrane blebbing and brain folding
process and 2) establish an effective strategy to uncover a broad range of basic
biological processes."

Up to 95% of premature infants undergo red blood cell (RBC) transfusion while in the intensive care unit, yet it
is unknown whether more restrictive or more liberal transfusions will lead to optimal brain development. The
Transfusion of Prematures (TOP) Trial is a multi-center study funded by the NHLBI and supported by the
NICHD Neonatal Research Network (NRN). The primary objective of the TOP Trial is to assess survival and
rates of neurodevelopmental impairment at 22-26 months corrected age in extremely low birth weight (ELBW)
infants that are randomized to either liberal or restrictive RBC transfusion thresholds. The trial began
enrollment in December 2012 and reached the target sample size of 1,824 infants on time in April 2017.
Although major deficits in motor and cognitive function may be detected at 22-26 months of age, these infants
are too young to assess cognitive, behavioral, and coordination skills that, if impaired, can lead to problems
with academic skills, motor performance or adaptive functioning in home or school environments, conditions
that are far more prevalent in this population and create substantial morbidity for the children and their families.
Because optimal transfusion management is a critical knowledge gap in neonatology, the currently proposed
TOP 5 Study will assess functional neurodevelopmental outcomes of infants randomized to two different
transfusion thresholds in the TOP Trial at 5 years corrected age.
The TOP 5 Study Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) is led by Co-PIs Dr. Peg Nopoulos, who has a ten-year
history of studying the outcomes of premature infants exposed to liberal or restrictive transfusion, and Dr. Sara
DeMauro, who has extensive experience conducting multicenter outcomes studies in collaboration with the
NICHD NRN and the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) at RTI International. The DCC PI Dr. Abhik Das also
leads the DCC for the NICHD NRN. The NRN has a superb track record in school-age outcomes research and
history of productive collaboration with NHLBI. Thus, the TOP 5 Study has been thoughtfully designed to
leverage existing successful research infrastructure, relationships, and resources in order to reduce
redundancy and ensure success. The results of the TOP 5 study will provide evidence about which
approach to neonatal transfusion (liberal or restrictive) minimizes damage to vulnerable neuronal
circuits and, in turn, which transfusion strategy will improve both short and long-term outcomes for
these vulnerable premature infants."
10866365,"Project Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine lung tumor responsible for over 30,000
deaths each year in the US. SCLC has a two-year survival rate of ~6% with no approved targeted therapies
beyond the recent approval of immunotherapy. SCLC is initially highly responsive to chemotherapy, but rapidly
develops resistance leading to mortality in ~12 months. A major unmet need for SCLC treatment is the
identification of new therapeutic targets and treatment strategies. SCLC has historically been treated as a single
disease without patient stratification. SCLC is driven by distinct MYC family members (MYCL or MYC), which
are notoriously difficult to drug. We and others showed that MYC and MYCL-driven SCLC have distinct molecular
phenotypes with unique vulnerabilities to targeted therapies. We performed unbiased metabolite profiling on
MYC versus MYCL-driven subtypes of SCLC and found that they are metabolically distinct. Using human cell
lines, genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs), and human patient-derived xenografts (PDX), we found
that MYC-driven SCLC is uniquely dependent on the amino acid arginine. Arginine depletion with pegylated
arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20) is the most effective drug we have tested in >25 drug combinations in GEMMs.
Consistently, MYC-driven SCLC has reduced ASS1 expression, the enzyme required to synthesize arginine. In
preliminary data, we discovered that MYC-driven tumor cells treated with ADI-PEG20 undergo autophagy and
ferroptosis. After dramatic initial responses, tumors eventually relapse with re-expression of ASS1 and metabolic
reprogramming with changes in one-carbon, polyamine, and ferroptosis-related pathways. We hypothesize that
arginine deprivation in MYC-driven SCLC promotes autophagy and death by ferroptosis, and that inhibition of
ferroptosis will improve the efficacy of ADI-PEG20. We also hypothesize that during ADI-PEG20 resistance, re-
expression of ASS1 leads to metabolic reprogramming that can be blocked by targeting new metabolic pathways.
To test these hypotheses, our objectives are: 1) Determine the function of autophagy and ferroptosis in response
to arginine deprivation in SCLC. 2) Determine mechanisms of resistance to ADI-PEG20 and test new
combination strategies to increase the efficacy of ADI-PEG20 treatment. This approach is innovative because
we will employ our immune-competent GEMM of MYC-driven SCLC and new human PDX that recapitulate key
features of the human disease. We will integrate state-of-the-art technologies in metabolite profiling and single
cell RNA-seq to understand the mechanisms of resistance to arginine deprivation in vivo. This research is
significant because arginine deprivation is being tested in numerous clinical trials in various cancer types and
we are currently designing new clinical trials for ADI-PEG20 in SCLC. A better understanding of the functions of
arginine deprivation may improve treatment of MYC-driven cancers and lead to more effective combination
treatment strategies."
10916408,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sepsis-associated acute respiratory failure is a leading cause of morbidity, mortality and health care expenditure
world-wide, and is increasing in incidence. Despite intensive investigation, there are few pharmacologic
interventions, and care is largely supportive. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a human herpesvirus that infects 50-
80% of healthy adults and establishes lifelong latency in the lung, generally causing overt disease only in
severely immunosuppressed patients. CMV reactivation (viral replication) from latency occurs in ~40% of CMV
seropositive, otherwise immunocompetent persons during critical illness and is associated with worse clinical
outcomes including increased mortality, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and increased ICU length of stay.
Compelling evidence implicating CMV reactivation as a causal contributor to morbidity and mortality in sepsis-
associated respiratory failure comes from animal models and our recently completed NHLBI-funded phase 2
randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT) of ganciclovir prophylaxis. In this trial, among CMV seropositive adults
with sepsis-associated respiratory failure, ganciclovir effectively suppressed CMV replication, had an acceptable
safety profile, and was associated with improved clinical outcomes, including increased ventilator-free days
(VFD), shorter duration of mechanical ventilation among survivors, shorter ICU length of stay, and improved
PaO2/FiO2 ratio in day-7 survivors. We hypothesize that IV ganciclovir administered early in critical illness will
effectively suppress CMV reactivation in CMV seropositive adults with sepsis-associated acute respiratory
failure, thereby reducing lung damage, accelerating recovery, and leading to improved clinical outcomes.
We propose to conduct a phase 3 RCT to determine whether the antiviral drug ganciclovir given as prophylaxis
improves VFDs and other clinically relevant outcomes when administered within 5 days of ICU admission to
CMV seropositive immunocompetent adults with sepsis-associated acute respiratory failure. We will measure
the effect of the study intervention on the primary trial outcome (VFDs) and secondary outcomes (mortality at 28
days, duration of mechanical ventilation in survivors, oxygenation, static respiratory system compliance, CMV
plasma and lung reactivation, and a core set of longer-term outcomes at 6 months). In exploratory analyses, we
will assess baseline factors as predictors for CMV reactivation, and characterize the relationship of CMV viral
load kinetics with VFDs and other clinical outcomes.
Our interdisciplinary team has unique experience in successfully coordinating multi-site multi-PI ICU-based
RCTs. We have established a network of 19 clinical sites in the US, all of which have robust infrastructure for
ICU clinical trials and proven ability to recruit patients into RCTs. If it is effective, this inexpensive and feasible
intervention has the potential to significantly improve care of patients with sepsis-associated respiratory failure,
substantially change clinical practice, and offer new insights into the sepsis-CMV reactivation relationship."
10701857,"N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is one of the most common causes of autoimmune encephalitis, with prevalence exceeding herpes encephalitis in industrialized nations. Typically, the disease affects patients age 10-50 causing prominent psychiatric symptoms, associated with declining consciousness, seizures, movement disorders and life-threatening dysautonomia. Intensive care, including cardiorespiratory support is required in 75% of cases. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of IgG autoantibodies against central nervous system NMDAR in the cerebrospinal fluid. Despite the severity of the illness, NMDAR encephalitis is a treatable neurological disease, with retrospective case series establishing the benefit of off- label intravenous steroids and immunoglobulins. These treatments are presumed to work through effects on IgG NMDAR autoantibody levels in the CSF, although prospective data informing predictors of treatment responses are limited. Even with prompt treatment, ~50% of patients remain disabled, requiring prolonged hospital admissions. Various off-label therapies have been proposed as “second-line” treatments in NMDAR encephalitis. The majority of second-line treatments target circulating B-cells with various degrees of blood brain penetrance and efficacy, and poor consensus on the timing, dose and route of delivery of candidate agents. High-quality evidence is needed to inform the treatment of NMDAR encephalitis. Inebilizumab is a promising therapeutic monoclonal antibody for the treatment of NMDAR encephalitis. This humanized monoclonal antibody against the B-cell surface antigen CD19 was recently shown to be safe and efficacious in the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder—another antibody-mediated disorder of the central nervous system. Compared to other off label B-cell depleting therapies, such as rituximab, inebilizumab not only depletes CD20+ B-cells, but also CD20- plasma blasts and plasma cells, resulting in robust, broad and sustained suppression of B-cell expression. The Extinguish Trial will randomize 116 participants with moderate-to-severe NMDAR encephalitis to receive either inebilizumab or placebo in addition to first-line therapies. Patient outcomes will be ascertained at standard intervals using the modified Rankin scale and accepted safety measures (primary outcomes at 16 weeks), together with comprehensive well-validated neuropsychological tests, bedside cognitive screening tools, quality of life/ functional indices, and outcome prediction measures. Clinical data will be combined with quantitative measures of NMDAR autoantibody titers and cytokines implicated in B-cell activation and antibody production within the intrathecal compartment to identify treatment responders, inform the biologic contributors to outcomes, and evaluate for biomarkers that may serve as early predictors of favorable outcomes in future clinical trials in NMDAR encephalitis. The results of the Extinguish Trial will immediately impact patient care and will facilitate the design and implementation of future clinical trials in patients with autoimmune encephalitis."

The 5-year overall survival from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is less than 30%. While some patients are cured
with initial induction therapy, most patients relapse, and the expected outcomes in patients with relapsed and
refractory (R/R) AML are dismal. For this reason, developing methods to identify therapies likely to benefit R/R
AML patients is a top priority. This proposal aims to address critical unmet needs with a unique Academic-
Industry Partnership (AIP) between investigators at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Karyopharm
Therapeutics, and Notable Labs. The BCL2 inhibitor, venetoclax (VEN), is transforming clinical practice for AML,
but activity in R/R AML is less pronounced, and resistance occurs in most patients. AIP investigators currenty
lead a multi-site investigator-sponsored study, testing VEN in combination with the selective inhibitor of nuclear
export (SINE) selinexor (SEL) in a Phase I trial for R/R AML (NCT03955783). This SEL/VEN trial grew from the
discovery that SEL synergizes with VEN and overcomes resistance mechanisms in some VEN-insensitive
patient samples. Given this, our AIP team has worked together to develop a precision medicine functional
platform for this novel combination in R/R AML. Notable Labs utilizes an automated high-throughput,
immunophenotype-based flow cytometry method to provide real time drug sensitivity data on multiple, specific
cell populations simultaneously within a given patient sample. Building from the only annotated cohort of patient
samples treated with SEL/VEN in the world, we propose to develop a precision medicine functional assay to
identify R/R AML patients most likely to benefit from SINE/VEN combination therapy. We will build, refine and
optimize the functional platform for SEL/VEN with samples from our current Phase I study and train the platform
on samples from the Phase 2 SEL/VEN clinical trial proposed by the AIP. Aim 1 will focus on determining assay
parameters specifically for SEL/VEN in R/R AML. Aim 2 will train the model with the phase II clinical trial of
SEL/VEN in R/R AML, and Aim 3 will contextualize the predictive analytic model on heterogenous genotypes
found in R/R AML. At the conclusion of this study, the functional medicine platform will be a companion
diagnostic ready for external validation which we will lead in a phase III efficacy trial of SEL/VEN in R/ R AML,
and serve as proof-of-principle for development of similar therapy-specifc precision medicine tools."
10818532,"PROJECT SUMMARY
HIV-infected individuals harbor viral quasispecies that differ in genetic sequences and susceptibility to broadly
neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) targeting the HIV envelope (Env). Due to difficulties with current assays in
confirming viral sensitivity to bNAbs, most clinical trials enrolled participants without knowledge of their viral
susceptibility. Thus, an accurate and sensitive assay with quick turnaround (1-2 weeks) is needed. We propose
to approach this aim with two prongs: Aim 1, a phenotypic (Env function) assay for bulk Env neutralization
assessment and Aim 2, a genotypic (Env sequence) algorithm for high-throughput prediction of neutralization
susceptibility. We propose 10 HIV bNAbs targeting 5 distinct gp120 sites for assay development, with 2 non-HIV
human IgG1 antibodies as negative controls. Current assays are difficult because of two labor-intensive and
time-consuming procedures: Env single-genome amplification (SGA) and individual Env cloning. Aim 1 will
address the latter procedure required because the current TZM-bl neutralization assay cannot tease out bulk
Env clones that differ in bNAb susceptibility. Aim 1 will apply DNA barcoding to simultaneously track bNAb
sensitivity of hundreds of Env variants in a high-throughput manner. This will be achieved by a novel Env-
expressing lentiviral system in which each Env is linked to a unique barcode sequence. Aim 2 will address Env
sequencing, for which SGA is necessary because Sanger sequencing cannot sequence bulk templates. We
propose in Aim 2 to apply a third-generation sequencing technology, Nanopore sequencing, for effective bulk
template sequencing and develop machine learning models for a fast and reliable prediction algorithm.
Combining with the ample bNAb neutralization data from literature and Aim 1 of this project, trained
computational models can be fast, accurate, and high-throughput to predict bNAb susceptibility. Since the
detection of a low yield of functional Env sequences and minority variants from participant’s HIV DNA reservoir
is essential, we propose in Aim 3 to investigate whether a virion capture assay could be applied to enrich
functional Envs. We will also apply a DNA analysis to enrich minor variants from the viral reservoir. We have
biospecimens stored onsite and access to a wide distribution of HIV subtypes from the AIDS Clinical Trials Group
(ACTG) and HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) biorepositories for assay development and validation. All
proposed R61 Aims have clear milestones defined and the R61 assays will be developed with streamlined and
standard operating procedure (SOP) for adaptation to clinical labs. The Columbia Clinical Trials Support
Laboratory is fully equipped and staffed to perform the SOPs and provide input and validation on assay
performance. Successful development of an accurate and sensitive bNAb susceptibility assay with quick
turnaround will alter the enrollment for bNAb trials and greatly improve clinical development of bNAb products."

Targeting IL-18 in Thymic Regeneration
 The thymus, the organ responsible for T cell development, is both highly sensitive to acute injury and
capable of regeneration. However, the thymus progressively loses its function with age such that there is
markedly reduced capacity for T cell production and recovery from damage even early in adulthood. The
thymus is particularly sensitive to pre-hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) cytoreductive conditioning.
Therefore, transplant recipients are at increased risk of opportunistic infection as well as relapse of malignancy
during a prolonged period of T cell deficiency. No clinically approved strategies currently exist to improve
thymic function and treat lymphopenia. Better understanding endogenous pathways of thymic damage and
regeneration may inform therapeutic strategies to this end.
 Here, we provide evidence supporting the involvement of pyroptosis induced interleukin-18 (IL-18) as a
negative regulator of thymopoieisis following acute injury and propose its targeting for improving organ function
in settings of lymphopenia. Aim 1 of this study investigates the source of this suppressive IL-18 following acute
damage by sublethal irradiation (SL-TBI) and its downstream cellular effectors. Specifically, we investigate
thymic epithelial cells (TECs) and innate lymphoid cells within the thymus as effectors of IL-18’s mechanism of
action. Aim 2 of this study proposes the temporal attenuation of IL-18 signaling using anti IL-18 monoclonal
antibody as a novel therapeutic strategy to improve thymic recovery, and subsequently, peripheral T cell
reconstitution and function. I put forward clinically relevant transplant models to assess its potential for
improving regeneration post-HCT. Additionally, I will assess the potential of blocking IL-18 signaling in aged
models of thymic involution. Together, these studies will not only provide insight into the biological mechanisms
of tissue injury and repair, but also will offer an innovative therapeutic strategy to boost immune function
especially in recipients of HCT."
10932178,"ABSTRACT – PROJECT 3
Project 3 proposes a concerted effort to decrease the 10-15% rate of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) recrudescence
that is currently experienced by patients. Previous work by the investigators in this Program Project Grant has
shown that a small number of Hp colonies persist deep within the gastric glands after eradication therapy. These
colonies may not be detected using conventional clinical tests, as the colonies reside in recrudescence niches
that are consequently resistant to antibiotic treatment. Highly sensitive molecular technology can reveal the
presence of Hp in conventionally ‘negative’ gastric histology samples. The central hypothesis of Project 3 is that
use of highly sensitive, sequencing-based technology to identify persistent Hp organisms and guide eradication
may both prevent Hp recrudescence and arrest neoplastic progression. The specific aims of Project 3 are:
 (1) Leverage gene expression profiles of gastric epithelial cells as a predictor of gastric intestinal
 metaplasia (GIM) progression in Hp negative individuals.
 (2) Develop molecular risk-stratification strategies in Hp histology negative subjects.
In Aim 1, 300 Hp negative subjects will undergo RNA sequencing, and concordance with the ‘high-risk’ patterns
will be assessed through a gene expression vector. We will then translate the ‘high-risk’ expression signature
into a clinically useful multiplex IHC test. In Aim 2, samples from patients with GIM who are histology negative
for Hp on biopsies will be sequenced for molecular detection of Hp. A subset of patients will participate in a
randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the effect of antibiotic therapy on molecular Hp titers. This trial
will demonstrate whether a sequencing-based eradication strategy can reduce Hp burden to molecularly
undetectable levels in human subjects."
10895541,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Cancer is highly adept at exploiting normal physiological functions to
support its growth. One important component of tissue physiology is neurons which weave through our
organs, releasing neuropeptides into nearby tissue. Importantly, the role innervation plays in malignancy and
anti-tumor immunity remains largely unknown and understudied. Our preliminary analysis shows that tumor
infiltrating immune cells express high levels of receptors for sensory neuropeptides, which further positively
correlates with expression of genes associated with immune cell dysfunction. These data suggest that
innervation may play an important role in regulating anti-tumor immunity. To test this hypothesis, we propose
strategies to investigate the role of innervation in cancer, and to determine how neuropeptide sensing on
immune cells impacts anti-tumor immunity in the following objectives:
Objectives of Unnerving Cancer: (1) Investigate the degree of sensory neuron innervation in cancer (2)
Determine how neuropeptide sensing on DCs impacts anti- tumor immune responses.
Using reporter tools and multiplexed imaging, we will determine innervation of tumor tissues in pre-clinical
models and patient samples. Building on our results, we will investigate the functional and transcriptional
effects of neuropeptide sensing on immune populations using endogenous and syngeneic models.
Results from this project have the potential to significantly advance our current understanding of the nervous
system's contribution to cancer. Therapeutically, exploiting the neuronal vulnerability of cancer using existing
clinically approved neuromodulators has the potential to rapidly translate clinically for the prevention and
treatment of cancer. The legacy of this NCI funded interdisciplinary research will be to understand the neuro-
immune communication in cancer, opening doors for novel therapeutic strategies.

Graphical Abstract: Tumor innervation correlates with poor survival in several tumours. I propose to study
neuronal density in Skin and Lung tumour, and query correlation of neuronal density to therapeutic responses.
I hypothesise that Sensory Neurons release neuropeptides, including CGRP, which acts on receptor
expressing dendritic cells (DCs). Together this leads to blunted DC responses perpetuating CD8+ T cell
dysfunction and tumor progression.

10931414,"Summary/Abstract (PROJECT 1)
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells directed to the CD19 protein (CART19) have revolutionized the
treatment of a variety of B cell malignancies, with complete remission rates as high as 97% in certain types of
advanced leukemia. Many of these responses are sustained, but poor CAR T cell expansion and persistence
following infusion and antigen-negative escape are common mechanisms of treatment failure. It is critical to
investigate factors driving successful CAR T cell function in responding patients. Previous studies have indicated
that in lymphoid malignancies, durable remission is associated with activation of specific T cell pathways and
only some patients experience therapeutic levels of CAR T cell expansion and antitumor activity. During the
previous award period, we successfully developed a comprehensive understanding of the T cell-intrinsic and -
extrinsic mechanisms of resistance as well as tumor cell-intrinsic mechanisms that lead to relapse. Here we
propose extensive next-generation analyses to understand properties of optimal CAR T cell therapy, elucidate
mechanisms of resistance, and develop strategies to overcome resistance and enhance CAR T cell activity to
cure more patients with hematologic diseases. We will take advantage of already established successful
collaborations with core laboratories possessing expertise in cell manufacturing, gene editing, and state-of-the-
art correlative science platforms to explore a number of innovative aims. In Aim 1, we will carry out an extensive
analysis of T cell receptor (TCR) rearrangements, vector copy number, T cell subsets analyzed by flow
cytometry, serum cytokines and biomarkers (~7,000), and transcriptional landscapes of CAR T cells in blood as
well as tumor tissues and formulate multi-omics models linking correlative data and outcome. In Aim 2, we have
designed a high-impact clinical trial to knockout CD5, an unconventional negative immune checkpoint molecule
and inhibitor of antigen-receptor signaling, with the goal of increasing the therapeutic index of 3-day
manufactured CART19 cells for relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies. Finally, in Aim 3, we will carry out
functional analyses of genes implicated in potentiating CAR T cell proliferation, persistence, and antitumor
function to develop `best-in-class' products for ALL, CLL, and NHL. Using a structured, multi-pronged strategy,
we hope to ameliorate resistance to CAR T cell-based therapies for B-cell malignancies and clinically advance
several next-generation synthetic biology tools. This work is expected to open therapeutic horizons in the field
of adoptive immunotherapy for cancer and offer new research prospects that could be translated to improving
the treatment of other cancers and autoimmune disorders."
10931461,"Project Summary
Alpha-particle -emitter radiopharmaceutical therapy (αRPT) is a new and rapidly evolving therapeutic modality
that can deliver highly potent, alpha-particles to disseminated cancer metastases, with 100 micron precise
radiation trajectory, and less toxicity in patients. Since almost all of the radionuclides used in αRPT emit photons
that can be imaged non-invasively, valuable pharmacokinetic and anatomical data is provided. Precisely
targeting the cancer without side effects to normal tissues would be a breakthrough for patient care. All patients
are different though and each patient may need αRPT dose adjustments but current implemented αRPT
protocols don’t achieve this goal. To address this unmet need, in experiments outlined in the application,
facilitated by Core B, dosimetry-driven treatment planning, in combination with a radiobiologic understanding of
how absorbed dose translates to biologic effect, will reduce the scope of human experimentation (costs and
timeline) needed to clinically optimize αRPT. To achieve these goals and test project hypotheses, Projects 1-4
address multiple steps to improve αRPT and rely on the Animal Models, Pathology and Tissue Core to facilitate
all projects using animal models or human tissue-based analyses. Core B molecular tissue techniques will
address the role of DNA damage by αRPT and DNA repair pathway inhibitors in project 4. The overall hypothesis
of this PPG is that αRPT is a systemic cancer therapy modality that is particularly applicable to targeting
metastatic cancer; and far less susceptible to conventional resistance mechanisms; yet it is amenable to
dosimetry-driven treatment planning. In the experiments proposed, S values measurements can be perfected
down to a microscale to focus the alpha-particle delivered dose on cancer and eliminate peripheral collateral
organ damage. The Animal models, Pathology and Tissue Core are led by an experienced veterinary
pathologist/toxicologist and a MD pathologist at Johns Hopkins University who have long contributed to cancer
therapeutic research at this institution. The emphasis of the Core is to assist PIs of the four projects in three
different areas, (1) animal models (2) necropsy, tissue sampling, processing, and histopathology with αRPT
image correlation and (3) in situ assays on human and animal tissues to assess DNA damage and repair.
Standard operating procedures of the Core for biospecimens incorporate the guidelines as outlined by the 2011
Revised NCI Best Practices for Biospecimen Resources. Rigor and reproducibility, as well as sex as a biological
variable and appropriate animal numbers will be addressed in experimental design. The PIs of this Core have
the necessary expertise and methodologies to provide pathology consultation for use of the human specimens
and animal tissues for the proposed studies with a combined 30 years of collaboration with members of this
program project and JHU research community. This valued knowledge and experience is applied to improving
patient cancer αRPT therapeutics, reducing toxicity resulting in a high impact on public health and patient care."

At the root of health disparities is the diversity that exists in the biological, behavioral, sociocultural, and
environmental characteristics of individuals and populations. Hawai`i offers exceptional opportunities for minority
health research due to its uniquely diverse population with varying cancer burdens and its high-quality health
care and cancer registration. The University of Hawai`i Cancer Center has a successful track record of leveraging
Hawai`i's multiethnic population to study racial/ethnic differences in cancer risk and outcomes. It has built a
community-facing infrastructure to translate these findings into major biological discoveries and clinical
innovations that would help to alleviate cancer disparities in the US. We propose in this P50 (PAR-20-305) to
establish a SPORE program to conduct translational research focusing on Asians Americans, Native Hawaiians
and Pacific Islanders (AANHPI), the fastest growing US minority, to initially address three cancers of particularly
high relevance. Project 1 will address the high rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in this population by
implementing a randomized lifestyle intervention among AANHPI patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD)
and by investigating mechanistic biomarkers (cell-free and leukocyte DNA methylation) that may also provide
much needed clinical management tools. We will test the efficacy of intermittent vs. continuous energy restriction
to reverse the progression of NAFLD in AANHPI, the most common etiology of chronic liver disease and liver
cancer in this population. Project 2 will address the excess lung cancer burden experienced by Native Hawaiians
by developing a risk-based and culturally-informed lung cancer screening strategy, and investigate the mutation,
methylation and transcriptomic profiles of lung squamous cell and small cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas
that contribute to the unexplained poor survival in this vulnerable population. Project 3 will address the very high
breast cancer burden of Native Hawaiians and the rising rates in Asian Americans by testing the adequacy of
current radiomic risk prediction algorithms for predicting breast cancer in these populations and by investigating
related molecular and histopathologic features of breast tumor environment which may be related to visceral
adiposity and have prognostic significance. We will also establish: 1) an Administrative Core with strategic
planning, advisory and evaluation components; 2) an Outreach and Recruitment Core (ORC) facilitating
studies among minorities; 3) a centralized biorepository of paired fresh-frozen tumor and blood samples, as well
as archival tumor blocks (Pathology & Biospecimen Core); 4) a Biostatistics & Bioinformatics Core; 5) a
Developmental Research Program to fund innovative pilot studies and a Career Enhancement Program to
support promising investigators new to translational research; and 6) new collaborations, with other institutions
for the further translation of our findings. The successful completion of this grant will significantly advance our
ability to reduce the high burden of liver, lung and breast cancers in AANHPI and to conduct other innovative
translational minority health research that will benefit Hawai`i, the Pacific region and the rest of the US."

The purpose of the Administrative Core is to provide the leadership and administrative management for the
proposed multidisciplinary P50 SPORE aimed at capitalizing on the infrastructure at the University of Hawai`i
Cancer Center (UHCC) and the racial/ethnic diversity of its catchment area to conduct translational research
addressing the racial/ethnic differences in cancer risks and outcomes that exist in Hawai`i and the Pacific. The
Administrative Core will build upon a number of UHCC resources, both administrative and scientific, to foster the
implementation and coordination of the research in this P50. This Core will also closely coordinate the P50
resource-building and career-development activities with those implemented by UHCC, so greater efficiency is
achieved at the institutional level. Thus, this Core serves major administrative and integrative functions for the
grant. The P50 will rely on an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), consisting of key senior basic and clinical
researchers on cancer disparities, to receive input on research opportunities and to facilitate coordination with
potentially synergistic local initiatives. The program will also benefit from the input of a Community Advisory
Board (CAB) composed of community leaders and patient advocates with experience in cancer disparities and/or
survivorship, and who will advise on the responsiveness of our activities to community needs and expectations.
Program evaluation will heavily rely on the input of an External Advisory Board (EAB) composed of outside
investigators who are leaders in SPOREs and/or cancer health disparities research and a nationally-recognized
patient advocate. Specific Aim 1 will be to provide the overall scientific and administrative coordination and joint
leadership for the P50 grant. Specific Aim 2 will be to coordinate and integrate the P50 activities with those of
UHCC. Specific Aim 3 will be to plan and evaluate current and future translational cancer disparities research
as part of the P50 SPORE program. The Administrative Core will play an essential role in supporting the research
program proposed in the P50. We believe that the skills and experience of each Core Co-Leader and the proven
approaches described in this section will provide both the foundation and the building blocks to achieve our
goals."
10931598,"ABSTRACT
We have shown in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) that Native Hawaiians have a markedly higher risk of lung
cancer and a poorer survival from the disease compared to (non-Hispanic) Whites, even after accounting for
smoking history and other risk/prognostic factors. This excess risk was observed for the two most common
histologic cell-types: adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma as well as for small-cell lung cancer, a more
aggressive cell-type. The poorer survival is observed with early stage and not advanced disease. We have made
extensive efforts in the study of genetics, epigenetics and smoking and tobacco carcinogens-related biomarkers
to understand the differences in lung cancer risk across populations. While the high risk in African Americans
and low risk in Japanese Americans can be explained by higher and lower smoking intensity (carcinogens dose
per cigarette), due to smoking behavior and lower nicotine metabolism, respectively, reasons for the risk excess
in Native Hawaiians remain to be elucidated. Lung cancer screening using low-dose Computed Tomography
(LDCT) among adults aged 50 to 80 years who have a 20 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke, or
have quit within the past 15 years, has been found to decrease mortality. However, the state of Hawaii ranks last
in the proportion of lung cancers diagnosed at an early stage (19% vs. the national average of 24%), with less
than 3% of high-risk smokers undergoing LDCT scan (national average is 6%). Studies have suggested that the
use of risk-based prediction models may be more effective than the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
(USPSTF) criteria at identifying high-risk smokers for lung cancer screening. However, both the USPSTF
guidelines and these risk prediction models were derived from data collected in mostly European-descent
populations. We also found that there may be distinct biological processes related to tumorigenicity that
contribute to the excess risk and poor disease outcomes for Native Hawaiians. We observed differences in
epigenetic patterns in blood leukocyte DNA associated with smoking dose in Native Hawaiians when compared
to other racial/ethnic groups, with the differential methylation occurring in cancer-related genes. To reduce the
lung cancer burden of Native Hawaiians, we propose a multilevel translational study to identify the individual-
and provider-based barriers for lung cancer screening to develop an intervention strategy to be disseminated in
collaboration with the Hawaii Department of Health (Aim 1), to better identify those at greatest risk of developing
lung cancer by computing a Native Hawaiian-specific risk prediction model (Aim 2), and to characterize the tumor
pathobiology associated with the poor survival of Native Hawaiian lung cancer patients (Aim 3). Study findings
will provide critical information along the continuum of lung cancer healthcare for a high risk minority population.
During this grant cycle, we will develop collaborations to translate our findings into validated culturally-tailored,
precision-based interventions to increase early detection and efficacy of treatment modalities in this high-risk
underserved minority population."
10931602,"SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The risk of breast cancer among U.S. women dramatically differs across racial and ethnic populations.
Nonetheless, Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (AANHPI) ethnic minority women have been
historically underrepresented in breast cancer research. Consequently, there are major gaps in understanding
the basis of disparities in these populations including high incidence and mortality among Native Hawaiians and
a steadily rising incidence with comparatively favorable outcomes among Japanese Americans. Obesity and
breast density, established breast cancer risk factors, vary widely across AANHPI women and have direct
implications for mammographic screening and primary prevention. Our research to date provides strong
evidence that body fat distribution, including visceral adipose tissue (VAT), is an important predictor of breast
cancer risk. The influence of adiposity on breast density and other aspects of breast architecture that can be
discerned through mammographic screening (e.g. radiomic features) is not well understood. Our long-term goal
is to elucidate the breast cancer disparities seen in understudied minority AANHPI subgroups (Native Hawaiian,
Micronesian, Japanese, Chinese, Filipina) that can be translated to improved prevention, early detection, and
therapeutic strategies. Our central hypothesis is that established radiomic risk features have unique
associations with breast cancer incidence in AANHPI subgroups and that they are correlated with tissue
biomarkers of risk and prognosis and with obesity, especially VAT. Study resources include the statewide
Hawai`i Pacific Islands Mammography Registry linked to the SEER Hawai`i Tumor Registry and its Residual
Tissue Repository (RTR), and to the Hawai`i component of the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC). Our study is
focused on the minority health of AANHPI, with the following aims: 1) Characterize the relationships of
established breast imaging radiomic risk features with tissue protein biomarker expression profiles reflecting
the tissue microenvironment and breast cancer prognosis and with disease-specific survival; 2) Characterize
the joint relationships of breast radiomic risk features and different measures of adiposity, including VAT, with
post-menopausal breast cancer risk among Native Hawaiian, Japanese American, and White MEC
participants. 3) Calibrate commonly used risk prediction models for breast cancer by including established
breast radiomic (AI and machine learning) risk features from 2D and 3D mammography in AAPHI and White
women overall and by estrogen/progesterone receptor and HER-2 status. The expected outcome of the
proposed study is to further our understanding of unique relationships between imaging biomarkers derived
from advanced machine learning approaches and race/ethnicity, tissue molecular characteristics and adiposity
phenotypes, which will improve risk and prognosis model accuracy and better identify high risk women for further
assessment or tailored therapy."

The University of Hawai`i Cancer Center (UHCC) SPORE Career Enhancement Program (CEP) will identify and
mentor investigators who show promise for independent research careers in translational research in minority
health and correcting ethnic/racial disparities in cancer. We understand that creating a sustained, high-impact
minority health program is dependent upon attracting the most promising investigators from a diverse talented
pool inclusive of underrepresented groups including racial/ethnic and sexual/gender minorities, women, veterans,
and individuals with disabilities, to help these faculty members excel through quality mentorship and research
support. UH Cancer Center members have access to unique opportunities in Hawai`i and the Pacific to do
innovative research in minority health and disparities research in cancer due to the multiple racial and ethnic
populations living here and their varying cancer incidence and outcomes. Further, Hawai`i's high-quality health
care and cancer registration systems offers access to needed resources for these studies. UHCC has an
extensive record of successfully working with Hawaii's multiethnic population around minority health issues and
to identify and understand disparities in various cancers. We also have a long track record of mentoring our
promising junior faculty to independent research careers with particular success among researchers from
AANHPI background. The UHCC has also been successful engaging established researchers in developing new
projects in minority health and disparities research by providing forums to disseminate and discuss ideas that
are important to cancer prevention and treatment in our catchment. The goal of the CEP is to provide funding and
mentoring to junior faculty to develop independent research programs and to provide support to established
investigators to greatly enhance or refocus their careers on minority health research. In service of this goal, we
propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Coordinate identification of promising new research in disparities
research from junior faculty and established investigators looking to refocus their research in this area; 2) Provide
training, career development and mentoring to awardees in minority health research; 3) Monitor the progress of
CEP awardees as they develop independent careers and/or new research programs in minority health, and
assess effectiveness of the CEP approach. Through these activities, we will foster development of new diverse
faculty who conducts highly collaborative translational research in minority health focusing on Asian Americans,
Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders aimed at understanding differences in cancer risk and outcomes and
correcting ethnic/racial disparities in Hawai`i, the Pacific Islands, and more broadly on the US and global stages."

research efforts are central to the overall Markey Cancer Center (MCC) mission to reduce the cancer burden
with a focus on Kentucky and its most vulnerable populations through research, prevention, treatment,
education and community engagement. MCO investigators determine signaling, genetic, epigenetic and
metabolic mechanisms that promote cancer development, fuel tumor progression and contribute to therapeutic
resistance. To achieve its goal, MCO proposes three inter-related aims: 1) Identify aberrant signaling networks
and critical interactions of tumor cells with their microenvironment to delineate molecular mechanisms that
drive tumor initiation, progression and metastasis and resistance; 2) Determine the contribution of metabolic
reprogramming and epigenetic dysregulation to define novel pathways promoting cancer cell survival and
adaptation; 3) Delineate the mechanisms by which dysregulation of redox signaling promotes genomic
instability, therapeutic resistance and normal tissue toxicity. The 54 members of the MCO Program are experts
in cancer cell signaling, tumor microenvironment, cancer metabolism, epigenetic regulation and redox biology
who hail from 16 departments in the Colleges of Medicine; Engineering; Arts and Sciences; and Agriculture,
Food and Environment, reflecting diverse disciplinary perspectives. Cancer-related MCO funding is nearly
$10.3M in annual direct costs, and 53% of MCO peer-reviewed funding is from the NCI. Members have
published 320 manuscripts (July 2018–June 2022), of which 106 (33%) are inter-programmatic, 81 (25%) are
intra-programmatic, and 195 (61%) are inter-institutional. The program is co-led by three researchers with
expertise in each of the three programmatic areas. Dr. Rina Plattner (an expert in oncogenic kinase signaling
and tumor metastasis), Dr. Binhua “Peter” Zhou (a specialist in epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of
epithelial-mesenchymal transition) and Dr. Tianyan Gao (an expert in protein phosphatases and mitochondrial
regulation of cancer stem cells) bring together expertise in cancer signaling (Plattner, Aim 1), epigenetics and
metabolism (Zhou, Aim 2) and redox biology and mitochondrial bioenergetics (Gao, Aim 3). In addition to their
scientific leadership, each offers significant strengths in clinical translation, junior faculty mentoring,
communications among MCC Research Programs and expertise on populations within the MCC catchment
area. By leveraging comprehensive program strengths, the MCO Program collectively provides a rich
environment to facilitate multidisciplinary collaboration and builds a productive pipeline for translation of MCO
science into the clinic."
10931386,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 1
The effective treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) using oncolytic Herpes Simplex Virus (oHSV) will almost certainly
require both broad intratumoral virus spread and tumor destruction and virus-induced anti-tumor immunity. The
tumor microenvironment (TME) must be supportive of adaptive immune responses through the recruitment of
active tumor antigen presenting cells and responsive CD8+ T cells. However, GBM tumors are notoriously “cold”
tumors that are metabolically adept at preventing the development of a pro-inflammatory TME. This immune-
suppressive GBM TME exhibits upregulated expression of (1) the checkpoint proteins TIGIT and PD-1, and their
respective inhibitory ligands, and (2) the ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73 that increase local production of
adenosine (ADO); both pathways confer immunosuppression and tumor aggression. Here we propose to
improve the anti-tumor activity of rQNestin34.5v.1 an F strain oHSV-1. This virus has been engineered to allow
tumor-specific expression of natural viral genes that thwart innate anti-viral cellular responses (e.g. ICP34.5).
rQNestin34.5v.2, a modified version of rQNestin34.5v.1 with GFP removed, was shown to be safe in a patient
trial with evidence of intratumoral viral antigen expression for extended time periods (NCT03152318). Three
aims are designed to evaluate rQNestin34.5v.1 enhancement in patient derived xenograft (PDX) models and in
syngeneic GBM mouse models. We propose in Aim 1, to test the hypothesis that syncytial mutant variants of
rQNestin34.5v.1 will exhibit enhanced oncolytic activity, augmenting viral spread and persistence within the
tumor. In Aim 2, we propose to test the hypothesis that the therapeutic efficacy of rQNestin34.5v.1 can be
improved by arming the vector with a combination of IL-12, the checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) anti-PD-1 and anti-
TIGIT (Aim 2A), or with the adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene (Aim 2B). The efficacy of ADA-armed oHSV will
be tested in combination with oHSV expressing PTEN and anti-CD73 (oHSV-P10-CD73; Project 3) and
depending on the outcome, both arming genes will be introduced into a single vector for treatment efficacy
studies. Analysis of human clinical trial data has allowed Project 2 to define a TME profile characteristic of
rQNestin34.5v2 responders, demonstrating a correlation between patient response and increased TCR diversity.
In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that rQNestin34.5v.1 and armed derivatives will increase the accumulation
of effector T cell populations and induce clonal expansion of T cells that recognize viral- and tumor-specific
antigens. Aim 3 analyses will compare the armed vectors generated in Aim 2 to those generated by Projects 3
and 4 and will allow us to establish correlations across multiple oHSV variants with respect to clonal T cell
expansion and animal survival. The proposed vector modifications may substantially improve rQNestin34.5v.1
performance and effectively increase the number of tumors responsive to oHSV treatment, thereby potentially
providing a novel vector suitable for clinical development."

The Administrative and Professional Development Core is led by Lucy Liaw PhD, the PD/PI of this COBRE
program at MaineHealth. She will continue leadership of this successful program, which has flourished via
steady and dedicated management and mentorship, robust institutional support, targeted recruitment of
external investigators, and improvement of state-of-the-art scientific core facilities. In Phase I of this program,
all of the four initial junior project leads received NIH R01/R37 independent funding, and we have recruited
three additional junior investigator project leads to our program. Our core facilities continue to be in high
demand from our COBRE group and external investigators, and we have made instrumentation improvements
and developed new technologies based on user needs. In Phase II, we will be adding an additional junior
investigator project to our two newly initiated external recruits. This renewal proposes support for three junior
investigator projects focused on thermogenic adipocytes and systemic metabolism, the gut-bone axis following
bariatric surgery, and the impact of night shift work of pregnant women on pre-gestational diabetes and chronic
diabetes risk. The goals of this Phase II COBRE program are to foster and support scientific productivity and
collaboration, enhance and coordinate our research infrastructure, seek out and expand scientific expertise,
and actively oversee and monitor a professional development program. To accomplish these goals, this
Administrative and Professional Development Core will provide the organizational framework and leadership to
facilitate and encourage success. We are continuing support of three highly successful scientific core facilities
in the areas of Physiology, Histopathology and Microscopy, and Proteomics and Lipidomics. Our administrative
infrastructure relies on a robust mentoring network, with project leads engaging at least two mentors for
quarterly meetings and feedback. In addition, regular monthly COBRE team meetings, quarterly Clinical
Partners meetings, and twice annual Advisory Committee meetings round out our formal research progress
framework. The aims of this Administrative Core are to provide the research administrative and organizational
support to meet the goals of the overall program, which are:
 1) Provide leadership to evolve a robust Center infrastructure including administrative, fiscal and
 scientific management to support growth of collaborative research and resources in metabolic
 health and disease,
 2) Support career advancement for COBRE investigators and alumni,
 3) Maintain high quality shared scientific resources, and
 4) Accomplish these goals while building a diverse research community that is guided by principles of
 inclusion and equity."
10888331,"Histopathology and Microscopy Core (V. Lindner, Core Director)
The current Histopathology and Microscopy Core was established in 2004 within the COBRE in Stem and
Progenitor Cell Biology (8P20GM103465), with Dr. Volkhard Lindner as the Core Director. Services included
fixation, embedding, and processing of specimens for frozen and paraffin embedded sections and a spectrum
of routine and specialty histological stains and basic immunohistochemistry. Our staff has expertise to develop
and optimize immunohistochemistry procedures, including antigen retrieval, optimization in archival tissues,
and various detection methods. The success of this Core attracted users from our sister COBRE in Vascular
Biology, other investigators at Maine Medical Center, and regional clients, including from neighboring IDeA
states. Our services were in high demand, and led in 2011 to our COBRE in Vascular Biology (P30GM103392)
co-funding the Histopathology Core to increase research staff for expanded capacity, and add tissue
microarray services. This co-funding mechanism has been extremely effective, allowing for efficient expansion
of services. The Core with its current staff (Core Director and two full-time staff members) performs more than
30,000 procedures annually and in the past 14 years has directly supported close to 200 publications. During
Phase I of this COBRE in Mesenchymal and Neural Regulation of Metabolic Networks, plastic embedding and
sectioning as well as histomorphometry were established to meet demands by COBRE projects. To improve
efficiency, mineralized tissue histology services have now been consolidated with services provided by the
COBRE supported Histology and Imaging Core at the nearby University of New England. Efficiency and
capacities were also increased during Phase I by acquisition of a larger tissue processor that uses solvents
much more efficiently, thereby reducing costs and hazardous waste. As part of Phase II of this COBRE
application, we propose to integrate microscopy and confocal microscopy services under the directorship of Dr.
Prudovsky to meet the needs of Phase II supported projects and other federally funded research. Aim 1 of this
core is to continue to provide outstanding services and training in a full suite of histopathology services. Aim 2
is to seamlessly integrate microscopy and confocal microscopy services and training into our workflow, to
better serve the needs of our COBRE investigators and other users of this shared resource. COBRE
investigators will receive these services at no charge, and other investigators enjoy highly competitive pricing.
As in the past, the Core will also continue to offer its extensive and growing spectrum of services related to
histology with full utilization of existing equipment and instrumentation garnered from previous COBRE
support, as encouraged by NIGMS."
10888339,"Gut regulation of bariatric surgery-induced bone loss (Z. Li, Project Lead)
Bariatric surgery-associated skeletal complications include a two-fold risk in bone fracture, a side effect that
has been observed since the early 1990s. The most common bariatric surgery is vertical sleeve gastrectomy
(VSG), which leads to ~3-7% bone loss at the axial skeleton after 6-24 months. Current clinical management
includes bone mineral density assessments, consumption of adequate dietary calcium, vitamin D and protein,
and weight-bearing exercise. These countermeasures minimize, but do not fully prevent bone loss secondary
to bariatric surgery. A better mechanistic understanding of bone loss associated with bariatric surgery is
necessary to properly design and evaluate preventive and therapeutic strategies. Changes in gut hormones
and microbiota are potential mechanisms driving bone loss, but the contribution of the major surgical site (the
stomach) has been largely neglected. We propose that gastric hormones contribute to bariatric surgery-
induced skeletal complications. In key preliminary data, we found gastric X/A-like cells (P/D1 cells in humans),
a unique endocrine cell population, contribute to the regulation of global lipid metabolism, marrow adiposity
and bone formation, suggesting a stomach-bone axis. The aims of this proposal are: 1) to determine the
effects of gastric X/A-like cell-derived secretory factors on VSG-induced bone loss; and 2) to identify and
characterize gastric hormones (in additional to ghrelin) derived from X/A-like cells that regulate bone marrow
cells and skeletal homeostasis. For the first aim, we will utilize a diphtheria toxin model to deplete X/A-like cells
in the adult mouse stomach, and analyze bone parameters to determine the importance of X/A-like cells in
bone homeostasis. In addition, X/A-like cell derived ghrelin concentrations are decreased following VSG;
therefore, we will test the protective effects of ghrelin on VSG-induced bone complications. For the second
aim, we will determine the effects of X/A-like cell-derived secretome on adipogenesis, bone remodeling and
hematopoiesis. Furthermore, unbiased transcriptomic and proteomic screens will be performed to define the
secretome of X/A-like cells. This project will be supported by the Physiology Core for analyses of mouse body
composition, activity, and energy expenditure. The Histopathology and Microscopy Core will provide services
to characterize the tissue (gut and bone) phenotypes via histological and immunostaining analyses. The
Proteomics and Lipidomics Core will perform protein profiling of the gastric X/A-like cell secretome. The
proposed strategy will rigorously test the hypothesis that gastric X/A-like cell-derived secretory factors
contribute to VSG-associated skeletal complications. Determination of the importance of this cell population in
bone metabolism will provide new therapeutic targets for managing bariatric surgery-induced bone loss. This
project is led by a new junior investigator, Dr. Ziru Li, who will be supported by outstanding expert mentors in
bariatric surgery (Randy Seeley PhD), and bone homeostasis and remodeling (Clifford Rosen MD)."
10888342,"The role of night shift work in metabolic disorders during and after pregnancy
(I. Agarwal, Project Lead)
Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a large and growing epidemic resulting in significant morbidity and mortality to
both mothers and babies. GDM is a major risk factor for type II diabetes (T2DM), increasing the risk by 7-fold.
Factors that influence the risk of developing T2DM among women with a history of GDM are not well
understood. One emerging hypothesis is that circadian misalignment, or inappropriately timed sleep, may
influence the risk of GDM and subsequent T2DM. Night shift work, an extreme form of circadian misalignment,
has been consistently associated with a higher risk of T2DM in cross-sectional and prospective cohort studies.
Limited and conflicting data exist on the relationship of night shift work with GDM. My central hypothesis is that
night shift work increases the risk of GDM, and risk of progression from GDM to T2DM. I will test this
hypothesis using serially-collected longitudinal data from the national Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) 2 and 3
cohorts. The NHS contains detailed information on sociodemographic, clinical, reproductive, occupational, and
lifestyle variables, prospective measurement of incident clinical outcomes including T2DM over a median of 25
years of follow-up (NHS2), and hair and plasma biospecimens from a sub-cohort of pregnant women (NHS3).
Overall, the NHS is one of the most comprehensive, prospective longitudinal studies of its kind, and provides
unique opportunities to address important research questions. The aims of this project are to:
Specific Aim 1. Investigate night shift work as a modifiable risk factor for GDM, and test whether night shift
 work is associated with stress-related and inflammatory biomarkers measured in early
 pregnancy. If night shift work is associated with early pregnancy biomarkers, these could be
 used for risk-stratification, or as sub-clinical biological endpoints in future interventional trials.
Specific Aim 2. Determine the relationship between post-pregnancy night shift work and risk of progression
 from GDM to T2DM. This aim will investigate whether night shift work among high-risk women
 with a history of GDM increases the risk of progression to T2DM.
The proposed research is an integral component of my career development and is tailored to complement my
training activities. It will enable me to launch a successful career as an independent researcher with expertise
in shift work and metabolism. Furthermore, it addresses an important public health issue and will inform future
research including potential interventional studies to lower rates of GDM and subsequent T2DM."

10718272,"Many investigators have attempted to show that using intensive cognitive training to increase Attention-
Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) patients’ capacity to store information within WM might also reduce
symptom severity or functional impairment. Those studies were based on strong evidence for WM behavioral
and neural dysfunction in ADHD, a widely-held belief that WM-related brain dysfunction is etiologically
significant, and arguments that impaired WM contributes to the maintenance of the disorder. But despite
promising early evidence for WM storage training potential efficacy, a decade of equivocal and negative outcomes
from several well-designed randomized clinical trials have left investigators wondering why meaningful,
replicable ADHD clinical improvements are not always achieved when WM storage capacity is reliably enhanced.
Because few investigators want to mistakenly abandon such a promising intervention premise, there is a search
for novel working memory-related treatment targets that focus on something other than simple WM storage
capacity. In this R61/R33 proposal, we synthesize published findings and provide our own pilot neuroimaging
evidence to argue that a better WM training target might be brain regions that specifically underlie the executive
aspects of WM. Such executive working (EWM) memory operations represent patients’ ability to effectively use
the information represented in WM for behavioral and cognitive control. These abilities likely are more
meaningful to ADHD behavioral impairment than merely how large patients’ general WM storage capacity is.
An extensive theoretical framework supports that the ‘working’ part of WM involves a small handful of discrete
cognitive operations that flexibly manipulate information within WM, or stabilize WM representations in the
face of different types of environmental distraction. Dozens of prior fMRI studies reliably link the four primary
types of these EWM operations to activity within specific brain regions – the superior frontal sulcus and mid-
lateral prefrontal cortex. Converging evidence including our pilot evidence shows these regions function
abnormally in ADHD, predict ADHD symptom severity, and can be enhanced by practicing EWM tasks. NIMH’s
R61/R33 experimental therapeutics mechanism is ideal to learn if a typical 5-week, course of intensive training
that uses these EWM exercises can engage the proposed brain targets linked to both EWM ability and to ADHD
dysfunction. If this neuroscience-guided, initial 2-year R61 study phase achieves its milestones, a subsequent
R33 study phase will seek to replicate, and then show the relevance of target engagement to ADHD clinical
function. If both R61/R33 aims are achieved, a series of secondary analyses will re-examine the trial outcome
data. These efforts will inform the design of any subsequent preliminary efficacy study, facilitating a rapid
transition into larger-scale efficacy testing."
10895509,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The American Consortium of Early Liver Transplantation-Prospective Alcohol-associated liver disease Cohort
Evaluation (ACCELERATE-PACE) study is a prospective longitudinal cohort of patients with severe alcohol-
associated liver disease (ALD) evaluated for early liver transplantation (ELT). The cohort leverages the
ACCELERATE consortium with 4-linked R01s and 5 additional recruitment sites in the South/Southeast, Mid-
Atlantic, Midwest, and West, and will refine and identify best practices in the selection and management of
patients with severe ALD considered for ELT across their continuum of care. ALD is now the most common
indication for liver transplantation (LT) in the U.S. Historically, LT centers required at least 6 months of alcohol
abstinence before LT referral and evaluation, though empiric evidence to support minimum sobriety periods was
limited. ELT, defined as LT before 6 months of abstinence, is increasingly performed but with significant practice
variability. There is no consensus on optimal ELT candidate selection, and selection criteria vary widely,
contributing to disparities in access to lifesaving care. ELT is also controversial due to the potential for liver
recompensation with abstinence, which would obviate the need for LT—accurate prediction of recompensation
has the potential to increase organ utility and stewardship. Detailed evaluation of the efficacy of alcohol use
disorder treatments and improved risk scores based on pre-LT psychosocial factors to predict return to alcohol
use are needed to refine selection criteria, optimize post-LT care, and effectively treat AUD. Short- and
intermediate-term survival after ELT is excellent, but the incidence and predictors of post-LT complications are
poorly defined. To fill these key knowledge gaps, we will enroll and prospectively follow 770 ELT
candidates and 270 ELT recipients for 3 years at 9 socio-demographically diverse centers. The proposed
Aims will: (i) inform ELT selection criteria and investigate potential sources of bias in ELT evaluation and
healthcare disparities in ELT access; (ii) develop risk prediction scores for LT-free survival and recompensation;
(iii) identify effective treatments (medical, behavioral) for alcohol use disorder among patients with severe ALD
and post-ELT; (iv) evaluate clinical outcomes among ELT candidates and recipients, including mortality,
transplantation, post-LT complications (e.g. cancer, cardiovascular events, graft rejection/failure), and quality of
life. A comprehensive data repository will include sociodemographic, clinical, geospatial, psychosocial,
behavioral, and patient-reported outcome variables. LT documents, checklists, recordings of selection meetings,
direct observations of LT procedures, and clinician interviews will identify best practices and pitfalls in candidate
selection. A biorepository of blood, urine, explant/donor tissue, pre- and post-LT liver tissue, peripheral blood
mononuclear cells, and cross-sectional radiologic imaging will inform future ancillary studies."
10894111,"Summary
Cellular mRNAs are susceptible to a variety of chemical modifications that play important roles in regulating gene
expression and cellular function. The most abundant internal mRNA modification is m6A, which occurs when
adenosine residues become methylated. m6A influences nearly every aspect of the mRNA life cycle and is critical
for a variety of physiological processes, such as gametogenesis, neurodevelopment, learning and memory,
immune regulation, and stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Additionally, m6A has emerged as an important
RNA regulatory mechanism during cancer progression: altered levels of m6A readers, writers, and erasers are
observed in several human cancers, and methylation of oncogenes and tumor suppressors has been shown to
impact their expression and promote cancer development. Thus, there is a great need both for understanding
how m6A is regulated in cells as well as for developing drugs that target the m6A methyltransferase machinery.
However, a major limitation has been the lack of simple, cost-effective methods for detecting changes in m6A
methylation in cells in a manner that is compatible with high-throughput screening (HTS). Here, we overcome
this barrier by developing a novel genetically encoded m6A sensor which provides a simple fluorescent readout
for m6A methylation in living cells. Aim 1 will optimize the m6A sensor system and generate cellular tools to
facilitate using the system for diverse applications. Aim 2 will develop the m6A sensor into a HTS-compatible
system and demonstrate its utility for drug discovery efforts by performing a pilot HTS designed to identify m6A
methyltransferase inhibitors. Aim 3 will create molecular tools incorporating the system and measure the
performance of the m6A sensor in vivo. Altogether, these studies will provide a much-needed tool for detecting
m6A dynamics in cells and will develop an optimized system for HTS-based studies of m6A methylation. Our
technology is likely to have an immediate impact both for basic investigations of m6A biology in cancer as well
as drug discovery efforts aimed at identifying novel m6A methyltransferase inhibitors."
10928788,"Summary/Abstract
With our increasing ability to measure biological data at scale and the digitalization of health records,
computational thinking is becoming ever more important in the biological science and healthcare. The research
directions proposed in this grant look to build robust machine learning models and tool for computational biology
by including principles and analysis from other engineering fields, like control, that have a proven record of
incorporating robustness into the systems they have automated. This increased robustness will save resources
during the development of these machine learning models. It will also lead to more reliable diagnostics, clinical
tools, and machine learning based biological discoveries. We have proposed three future research directions at
the intersection of machine learning, control, and computational biology (a) modeling dynamical systems, (b)
robust optimization schemes (c) control principles for in vivo modeling of microbial communities. The first
proposed research area involves the development of flexible models for performing inference on dynamical
systems models with time-series data. Dynamical systems models are able to learn mathematically causal
relationships between variables, compared to other models whose parameters may only have correlative
relationships. Our flexible models will be differentiable allowing them to be trained using the same efficient
algorithms and hardware that have propelled deep learning models into the spotlight. These differentiable
methods will allow for us to more easily integrate the uncertainty associated with biological measurements into
our models. The second research area looks to develop more robust gradient optimization algorithms, the work
horse for training deep neural networks. Many of the popular algorithms used to train deep neural networks were
not explicitly designed to be robust. By developing more robust optimization techniques machine learning models
trained on disparate data sets at different hospital or labs will be more reproducible and will require less time for
tuning parameters, ultimately saving resources as well. These robust optimization techniques will also aid in the
certification of machine learning based tools that will ultimately be deployed in the clinic. The third research area
we propose is an approach for the discovery and design of robust microbial communities. Communities of
commensal, or engineered, bacteria have long been proposed as alternative therapies for the treatment of gut
related illness (“bugs as drugs”). We propose a top down approach to identifying putative microbial consortia
members from time-series experiments with germ free mice colonized by complex flora. By beginning the
consortia design process in vivo we hope to overcome the challenge that many other attempts at consortia
construction have encountered where in vitro designed communities do not reproduce their intended properties
once transferred into living host organisms. The tools from this work will be built using open access software and
all data will be made easily accessible and explorable to the public."

11070282,"Alloimmunization to transfused RBCs remains a major problem for the large number of patients who require
transfusion (approximately 1 out of 70 people (~5,000,000 patients) annually in the USA alone). Although a
barrier to transfusion in multiple settings, alloimmunization is particularly problematic for patients with sickle cell
disease (SCD) due to 1) the increased rate of alloimmunization (up to 30%), 2) the need for chronic transfusion,
and 3) the risk of undetected (or new) alloantibodies causing potentially catastrophic hyperhemolysis. There are
very few effective therapeutic interventions to prevent RBC alloimmunization (e.g., extensive antigen matching).
For all transfusion indications, patients tend to be either “responders” that develop alloantibodies over time with
ongoing transfusion or “non-responders” with no detectable alloantibodies even after many transfusions.
Currently, we cannot predict which patients are likely to be responders and become alloimmunized. This P01
focuses on addressing the persistent problem of RBC alloimmunization for the large number of patients who
require transfusions and are at risk for alloimmunization. The program is structured around a central core (Core
A) that will collect longitudinal samples from a cohort of 2000 patients with SCD (at steady state, at time of
transfusion, and one-month post-transfusion) linked to detailed clinical information, including RBC
alloimmunization. Projects 1-3 combine novel translational murine models with clinical samples from Core A
while Project 4 uses samples from Core A to test hypotheses through an omics-based approach and generates
data on pathways studied in Projects 1-3. In this way, the proposed program creates a synergy of approaches
with the ability to translate murine findings into humans and model human findings in mice. Using the samples
from Core A as a common resource, four projects are proposed. Project 1 builds on a novel observation that
a mouse model of SLE recapitulates increased RBC alloimmunization observed in humans with SLE and utilizes
the model and samples from Core A to test the mechanistic role of TLR7, TLR9 and anti-nucleic acid antibodies
in RBC alloimmunization. Project 2 builds on our novel observation that multiple purinergic signaling pathways
regulate RBC alloimmunization in mice and utilizes mouse models and samples form Core A to test the
mechanistic role of CD73, AMP, Adora1, adenosine and Adora2b in RBC alloimmunization. Project 3 proposes
mechanistically driven studies in pre-clinical models and human studies to expand upon our novel finding that
reticulocytes (in donor RBC units or in transfusion recipients) are a risk factor for RBC alloimmunization. Project
4 will investigate the underlying genetic risk factors that predispose a given patient with SCD through analysis of
whole genome sequencing and the specific molecular drivers of alloimmunization to a given transfusion through
analysis of single cell RNASeq data. This P01 is designed to have near-term benefits of guiding clinical practice
by discovering predictors of responder/non-responder patients and longer-term benefits of elucidating
mechanisms of RBC alloimmunization to allow rational targets for therapy development."
11070283,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) have a significantly higher red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunization rate
than other populations receiving transfused donor RBCs. Depending on the study, circumstances of transfusion,
and environment, it has been reported that 18-47% of individuals with SCD become immunized to RBC allo-
antigens following a transfusion and are also more likely to then make additional alloantibodies with subsequent
transfusions. Transfusions in the setting of an acute SCD complication have an 8-12-fold higher odds ratio(1) of
resulting in alloantibody formation compared to those given at steady-state. We hypothesize that we will identify
key drivers of alloimmunization with a large-scale, unbiased human study that integrates recipient omics and
environmental conditions (i.e., presence or absence of acute illness and high levels of inflammation) at the time
of transfusion. We will test this through first identifying variants associated with alloimmunization through analysis
of genome sequencing (WGS) from responders and non-responders. We hypothesize that SCD individuals with
African heritage will have genetic variants associated with increased immunogenicity. To test this, we will
analyze the WGS of our Emory SCD cohort (n=2000) who have or have not developed alloantibodies after 10
or more blood transfusions and compare to WGS from the REDSIII cohort in TOPMed, which has
alloimmunization phenotypes on 2800 subjects with SCD from Brazil. Then, we will assess transcriptome
changes of leukocyte subsets at baseline, at time of transfusion, and at one-month post-transfusion in individuals
with SCD who did or did not develop alloimmunization. We hypothesize that we will identify alterations in gene
expression (and affiliated pathways) that associate with alloimmunization. This will have the immediate benefit
of allowing us to develop a transcriptional risk score (TRS) for alloimmunization, and the longer-term benefit if
identifying pathways for rational development of therapeutic interventions. Finally, we will assess the impact of
inflammation on alloimmunization. We hypothesize that alloimmunization in individuals with SCD that occur in
the setting of acute inflammation differs mechanistically from that of alloimmunization that occurs in the setting
of chronic transfusion or in healthy individuals. We will compare the transcriptomes obtained in aim 2 to
scRNAseq data obtained from stored PBMCs from a cohort of 40 non-SCD individuals who developed
alloantibodies when challenged by Rh mismatched RBCs. We predict our analysis will allow us to identify
individuals at risk for alloimmunization before it occurs, and elucidate the role of inflammation in
alloimmunization, both in patients with SCD and in healthy individuals."
11070287,"Project Summary/Abstract
Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) have a significantly higher red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunization rate
than other populations receiving transfused donor RBCs. Depending on the study, circumstances of transfusion,
and environment, it has been reported that 18-47% of individuals with SCD become immunized to RBC allo-
antigens following a transfusion and are also more likely to then make additional alloantibodies with subsequent
transfusions. Transfusions in the setting of an acute SCD complication have an 8-12-fold higher odds ratio(1) of
resulting in alloantibody formation compared to those given at steady-state. We hypothesize that we will identify
key drivers of alloimmunization with a large-scale, unbiased human study that integrates recipient omics and
environmental conditions (i.e., presence or absence of acute illness and high levels of inflammation) at the time
of transfusion. We will test this through first identifying variants associated with alloimmunization through analysis
of genome sequencing (WGS) from responders and non-responders. We hypothesize that SCD individuals with
African heritage will have genetic variants associated with increased immunogenicity. To test this, we will
analyze the WGS of our Emory SCD cohort (n=2000) who have or have not developed alloantibodies after 10
or more blood transfusions and compare to WGS from the REDSIII cohort in TOPMed, which has
alloimmunization phenotypes on 2800 subjects with SCD from Brazil. Then, we will assess transcriptome
changes of leukocyte subsets at baseline, at time of transfusion, and at one-month post-transfusion in individuals
with SCD who did or did not develop alloimmunization. We hypothesize that we will identify alterations in gene
expression (and affiliated pathways) that associate with alloimmunization. This will have the immediate benefit
of allowing us to develop a transcriptional risk score (TRS) for alloimmunization, and the longer-term benefit if
identifying pathways for rational development of therapeutic interventions. Finally, we will assess the impact of
inflammation on alloimmunization. We hypothesize that alloimmunization in individuals with SCD that occur in
the setting of acute inflammation differs mechanistically from that of alloimmunization that occurs in the setting
of chronic transfusion or in healthy individuals. We will compare the transcriptomes obtained in aim 2 to
scRNAseq data obtained from stored PBMCs from a cohort of 40 non-SCD individuals who developed
alloantibodies when challenged by Rh mismatched RBCs. We predict our analysis will allow us to identify
individuals at risk for alloimmunization before it occurs, and elucidate the role of inflammation in
alloimmunization, both in patients with SCD and in healthy individuals."
10932194,"Cancer Control Program: Summary/Abstract
The goal of the HDFCCC Cancer Control (CC) Program is to use a multi-disciplinary team approach to
understand and intervene on the structural and social determinants of cancer, leading to improved cancer
health outcomes and equity. This goal will be achieved by using intra- and inter-programmatic team science to
advance understanding of these multilevel determinants and to develop, translate, and implement effective
behavioral, clinical, and policy interventions that will reduce the burden of cancer in the catchment area and
achieve equity in cancer health outcomes.
The CC Program follows a “cells-to-society” approach interrogate the biological mechanisms underlying
structural and social determinants of cancer and translate these into interventions. The CC Program has the
capacity to integrate discovery, intervention, and delivery research. To do so, the program (1) identifies the
causes of outcomes across the cancer continuum, with attention to diverse populations, including structural,
social, policy, industrial, and environmental influences on tobacco use, physical activity, other risk factors,
cancer screening, and care; (2) develops, implements, and evaluates evidence-based interventions to reduce
the cancer burden and improve cancer health equity in the HDFCCC catchment area; and (3) translates
knowledge into effective policies and programs to achieve equity in outcomes across the cancer continuum."
10932199,"Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy Program: Summary/Abstract
The overarching scientific goal of the Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy Program (CII) is to advance the
understanding of the interplay between the immune system and cancer to discover new strategies for immune-
based immunotherapies and to mitigate therapeutic resistance. Overall, CII Program research has led to
advances in the understanding of the molecular basis for immune cell recognition of tumors, evasive
mechanisms evolved by tumors to escape immune surveillance, how the microenvironment influences the
immune response to cancer, and technological advances in genetic engineering of T cells for adoptive cell
therapies. The CII Program is a new program since the prior competing renewal. The HDFCCC-wide
realignment of research programs enhances opportunities for direct interaction between discovery scientists
and clinical investigators within the CII Program and between programs. Research strengths of members
include expertise in immunology, immunotherapy, the tumor microenvironment, cellular therapy, and immune
therapeutic resistance. The CII Program provides a unique opportunity to address issues related to disparities
in the catchment area in leukemia, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, melanoma, and lung cancer, with special
attention placed on understanding differences in the overall clinical responses as well as access to novel
immunotherapies in this diverse population. CII members are therefore positioned to translate HDFCCC
discovery science into the clinic, and to bring clinical observations back to HDFCCC laboratories. Specifically,
CII members conduct research to (1) define the mechanistic interplay between cancer and the immune system,
(2) advance therapeutic interventions to improve outcomes with cancer immunotherapy, and (3) identify
mechanisms of resistance to cancer immunotherapy."
10919764,"This randomized clinical trial (RCT) tests the efficacy of an emotion regulation treatment, Manage
Emotions to Reduce Aggression (MERA), to decrease aggression in Veterans with posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) and improve PTSD treatment initiation. Background: Veterans with PTSD symptoms
report difficulty controlling their aggression which can lead to devastating interpersonal and societal
consequences, such as incarceration, family violence, and disruption of social support. Veterans with
PTSD primarily engage in impulsive aggression (emotional, reactive, and uncontrolled) rather than
premeditated aggression (deliberate, instrumental, and planned). Emotion dysregulation, or
underdeveloped skills in emotional awareness, emotional acceptance, behavioral control, and/or content-
appropriate regulation strategies, fully mediates the relationship between PTSD severity and impulsive
aggression in Veterans. Additionally, Veterans report fearing their emotions as one reason they do not
initiate PTSD evidence-based psychotherapy. Emotion regulation appears to influence both aggression
and treatment initiation for Veterans with PTSD. Thus, this proposed study targets emotion regulation with
the goal of reducing impulsive aggression and preparing Veterans for PTSD evidence-based
psychotherapy. Research Plan: Our goal is to test the efficacy of an innovative emotion regulation
training, MERA, with a RCT of 204 Afghanistan and Iraq Veterans with PTSD and impulsive aggression.
MERA is provided in three sessions to address logistical barriers faced by younger Veterans who are
reintegrating into their communities. MERA incorporates education, cognitive-behavioral and acceptance-
based skills training. It also includes information about what emotional experiences to expect from PTSD
treatments. Three sessions of present centered therapy will serve as an active control group which is
consistent with treatment as usual. MERA and present centered therapy will be compared on changes in
aggression from Session 1 to the 2-month posttreatment changes. We predict Veterans who complete
MERA will have greater reductions in IA and emotion dysregulation as compared to Veterans who
complete present centered therapy. Finally, rates of PTSD evidence-based psychotherapy initiation
(attend 1 session), will be examined via a chart review 6 months post treatment. We predict Veterans who
complete MERA will initiate PTSD evidence-based psychotherapies at a greater rate than Veterans who
complete present centered therapy. Significance: This study supports 2 Veterans Affairs missions:
reduce aggression and increase PTSD treatment initiation. PTSD is one of the most commonly occurring
and costly psychiatric conditions among Veterans. Veterans with PTSD are more likely to engage in
aggressive behavior than civilians with PTSD or Veterans without PTSD. Reducing aggression is a critical
need for Veterans, their families, and society. Additionally, there are effective treatments that reduce
PTSD symptoms, yet few Veterans receive evidence based psychotherapies for PTSD. One reason for
the low rate of treatment initiation is that Veterans fear they will not be able to control their emotional
responses when they begin treatment. Equipping Veterans with emotion regulation skills and knowledge
about PTSD treatments may help them initiate treatment for PTSD."
10912580,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In this application for a 5-year K23 Career Development Award, I propose mentored research and career
development leading to a career as an independent clinical and translational investigator in interstitial lung
disease (ILD). The goal of this project is to identify the role of body composition in frailty among subjects with
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The prevalence of IPF is rising, currently affecting 1 in 200 older adults. There
is no cure for IPF. The only available medications slow disease progression but do not reverse disease. Frailty
affects up to 50% of IPF patients, and is characterized by decreased physiologic reserve and increased
susceptibility to severe manifestations of acute insults. The most common causes of death in IPF are acute
insults. Frailty is thus a potentially modifiable risk factor for morbidity and mortality in IPF.
This proposal builds on my preliminary work showing that (1) greater visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is associated
with increased frailty, (2) subjects with both sarcopenia and visceral obesity are at greater risk of frailty than
those with sarcopenia alone, (3) there may be distinct endotypes of exercise limitation defined by high
inflammation alone or low inflammation with high VAT, and (4) down-regulation of the growth hormone (GH) axis
may link VAT and frailty. Under the mentorship of Dr. R Graham Barr, I propose to evaluate the roles of body
composition by bioelectrical impedance assay (co-mentor Gallagher), inflammation, and neuroendocrine
dysregulation associated with frailty risk using a machine-learning approach (co-mentor Valeri). I will also
evaluate the role of growth hormone axis dysregulation in sarcopenia with visceral obesity in a rigorous overnight
protocol (co-mentor Freda). I propose to perform this in two NHLBI-funded prospective cohorts: Dr. Garcia’s
Families-At-Risk for ILD (R01HL103676) and Dr. Singer’s Advanced Lung Disease Lung Transplantation Study
(R01HL134851).
With guidance from my mentors, I have crafted a 5-year career development plan that includes training in body
composition analysis (Dr. Gallagher), measurement of complex endocrine systems (Dr. Freda), clinical trials (Dr.
Freda), biostatistics (Dr. Valeri), aging in interstitial lung disease (Dr. Garcia), and epidemiology (Dr. Barr). In the
last two years of this award, I will apply for R01 funding and transition to independence. The proposed activities
will prepare me to conduct patient-oriented research to evaluate the role of body composition in outcomes in
ILD. I will also acquire the skills and training required to design and conduct clinical trials targeting novel
pathways to prevent and treat frailty in ILD."
10914106,"Project Summary
Cancer is a systemic disease. Its growth and malignant progression relies not only on the intrinsic aberrant
genetic and epigenetic makeup of tumor cells, but also on the tumor-induced systemic factors which impact
cells in local and distant microenvironments. Importantly, there is dynamic crosstalk between the tumor-
educated tissues and organs and the tumor itself, especially during metastatic progression. As the tumor
reshapes its local microenvironment, coaxing it to support cancer growth, it exerts systemic effects, conquering
the immune system and distant organs, leading not only to metastasis but also to vascular changes (vascular
leakiness, coagulation), muscular and metabolic changes (cachexia), liver and lung failure, changes in bone
density (osteoporosis or osteopetrosis), and neuropathies, but maybe above all, inflammation and immune
suppression. The tumor exerts its systemic effects, coaxing the various organ systems of the host to support
cancer growth through tumor-secreted factors, such as soluble factors (cytokines and chemokines) and
exosomes (and exomeres, the novel particles we recently discovered) nanovesicles that carry complex cargo,
including proteins, metabolites, DNA and coding as well as non-coding RNAs. The development of effective
anti-metastatic therapies is predicated on our understanding of these iterative and complex interactions
between the tumor and its host, and on devising ways to interrupt this communication. We developed novel
approaches to analyze the heterogeneity and functional roles of tumor-derived exosomes and exomeres in
metastasis as well as their capacity to induce systemic changes. Ultimately, we propose to explore the
possibility that inhibition of specific exosome cargo molecules or their targets in hematopoietic cells could
reverse immunosuppression, pre-metastatic niche formation and the systemic effects of cancer. In summary,
we will focus on studying the mechanisms through which exosomes and exosomes regulate immune system
mobilization, metabolic changes and plasticity of pre-metastatic and metastatic niches in cancer models and
patients."
10873912,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading pathogens and intimately collaborates
with the adaptive immune system to maintain physiological homeostasis. However, components of the immune
response can sometimes become dysfunctional, failing in this protective role and even directly causing a variety
of autoimmune diseases. Immune dysfunction arises from an interplay of genetic and environmental factors,
however a mechanistic understanding of the various proteins and pathways that drive these conditions remains
incomplete. In particular, it is known that immune sensors, which are typically dedicated to protection against
infection, are sometimes usurped, and instead initiate and propagate autoimmune diseases such as systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Crohn’s disease. Specifically, self-induced signaling by nucleic acid-sensing
endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs 7 and 9) and the unchecked production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g.
type I interferons; IFN-I) in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are key events in the pathogenesis of numerous
autoimmune conditions. Thus, compounds that can suppress the production of these cytokines in pDCs would
be clinically useful agents for the treatment of such diseases. Recently, loss-of-function studies of the poorly
characterized endolysosomal solute carrier gene family 15 member 4 (SLC15A4) in lupus mouse models
revealed significantly reduced disease manifestation as well as near complete suppression of TLR7/9-mediated
production of IFN-I and other proinflammatory cytokines. In this application, we have leveraged our lab’s
innovative chemoproteomic fragment-based ligand discovery platform to develop a suite of chemical probes that
engage SLC15A4 in human pDCs, block SLC15A4 mediated transport, and suppress IFN-I production in human
and mouse primary pDCs. We will utilize an interdisciplinary strategy that draws upon the fields of chemical
biology, immunology and mass spectrometry to illuminate how SLC15A4 controls TLR-mediated production of
IFN-I in primary human and mouse immune cells and evaluate pharmacological inhibition in vivo. Specifically,
we will investigate the effects of SLC15A4 pharmacological inhibition on endolysosomal homeostasis, on the
protein interaction network of SLC15A4 and on signaling in immune cells crucial to autoimmune pathophysiology.
Critically, we will assess the therapeutic potential of SLC15A4 in disease models of inflammation, such as lupus.
The chemical tools generated, and knowledge gained from these studies are certain to greatly advance our
understanding of SLC15A4 biology, enabling the identification of novel strategies to treat human autoimmune
diseases."

Due to intersecting immigration, HIV, racial, and sexual minority statuses Latino immigrant men with HIV
(LIMWH) are at risk for high levels of exposure to interpersonal trauma (IT). IT is a social determinant of health
adversely impacting victims’ biopsychosocial and emotional health and has been associated with numerous
disparities including mental illness and poor engagement in care (EIC) among people living with HIV (PLWH).
Latino men are disproportionately impacted by HIV, and EIC-related outcomes such as retention in care
among Latinos are well below US and international goals. About 37-43% of Latinos newly diagnosed with HIV
are immigrants who face increased risk for IT such as violence before, during, and after migration. Latino
PLWH also have low engagement in mental health care and are at risk for low emotional support (ES)—a
protective resource shown to buffer the negative psychosocial, emotional, and behavioral impacts of IT.
Unfortunately, little is known about the impact of IT on EIC among LIMWH and the protective psychosocial
resources that influence EIC among LIMWH in the context of IT. To better understand these relationships
among LIMWH, this study will utilize the recent Patient Health Engagement (PHE) model describing
psychological and emotional processes involved in EIC. The purpose of this exploratory sequential mixed
methods study is to generate a rich understanding of the experiences of LIMWH with EIC and IT and the
psychosocial resources that HIV care teams can promote to improve EIC and psychosocial well-being among
LIMWH by addressing the following specific aims: Aim 1a: Understand the experiences of LIMWH (n=20) with
IT and the psychosocial and emotional influences that impact their EIC. Aim 1b: Understand the perspectives
of HIV care team members (n=15) caring for LIMWH regarding the impact of IT and psychosocial and
emotional influences on EIC in this population. Aim: 2: Examine the association between exposure to IT on the
continuum of EIC among LIMWH (n=100) while controlling for individual and interpersonal covariates. Aim 3:
Evaluate the association between ES and the continuum of EIC among LIMWH while controlling for individual
and interpersonal covariates. The proposed study will use preliminary results from semi-structured qualitative
interviews with LIMWH and HIV care providers from the Baltimore-Washington metro area to inform a
quantitative survey assessing the associations between IT, EIC and ES. The Framework method of qualitative
data analysis will be used to identify themes and key psychosocial variables to be included in the survey and
subsequent analysis using multivariable logistic regression models, model testing, and subgroup analysis. This
iterative approach incorporating the perspectives of LIMWH and HIV providers will strengthen the validity of the
findings and inform future research and psychosocial interventions among LIMWH to promote optimal EIC,
psychosocial wellbeing, and progress towards Ending the HIV Epidemic."

Over 1.5 million Americans suffer from type 1 diabetes (T1D), an autoimmune disorder involving insulin, a
hormone that is essential for blood glucose regulation and overall energy metabolism. When first diagnosed
with T1D, it is estimated that the patient’s insulin has been reduced by 70-90%. By this point, the immune
system has already targeted and destroyed a vast majority of insulin-producing beta cells found in islets of
Langerhans within the pancreas. This destruction occurs, in large part, through a barrage of pro-inflammatory
cytokines triggering cell death. For a century since its discovery, no other substantial therapeutic
advancements have occurred outside of insulin therapy to treat T1D. However, recent advancements focused
on beta-cell health have resulted in several clinical trials. ASAKE Biotech, in collaboration with investigators at
Ohio University, is developing a small-molecule therapeutic that may be able to treat T1D in two important
ways. In tests of rodent and human pancreatic islets in a dish, our lead compound MSB-3 protected beta-cells
from cytokine-induced cell death and also stimulated these cells to produce and secrete more insulin without
depleting insulin reserves. In our phase 1 grant, we collected data in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, a mouse
model of T1D, to show that giving MSB-3 daily beginning at 12-weeks of age completely blocked any rise in
blood glucose and reduced insulitis (a sign of reduced autoimmunity), whereas 60% of naïve control mice
developed T1D. Moreover, In NOD mice that already had diabetes (blood glucose >300 mg/dL), daily MSB-3
treatment stabilized blood glucose and even appeared to reverse the disease entirely with no other therapy
given at any point in the trial. Despite these promising effects in disease treatment, we are not certain how
MSB-3 works. In Aim 1 of this proposal, ASAKE has partnered with one of the leading experts in small-
molecule target identification to use photoaffinity chromatography and other techniques to identify the protein
target(s) of our lead compound. These data will be used to better inform compound development by medicinal
chemistry and to assess effects of new compounds on insulin secretion and beta-cell protection. To advance
product development, we will also test several routes of administration including a novel long-acting
subcutaneous pellet in Aim 2 and determine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in Aim 3. As a possible
clinical application, Aim 4 will determine whether MSB-3 could be a used as an additive to improve the efficacy
of human islet transplantation procedures. If successful, these studies will greatly aid the development of a
potential novel product to treat T1D."

Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a member of the subfamily gammaherpesvirinae and is
causally associated with the development of several malignancies including Kaposi’s sarcoma and primary
effusion lymphoma (PEL). The virus’ ability to establish latency as well as reactivate are essential for the
development of KSHV-associated disease. Despite these requirements for disease progression there are
significant gaps in knowledge regarding cell-intrinsic mechanisms that restrict the KSHV lifecycle. While innate
restriction is typically thought of in the context of antiviral immune responses, growing evidence suggests that
cellular RNA quality control pathways have an antiviral role. Nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) is an
evolutionarily conserved RNA decay pathway that facilitates degradation of RNAs on which ribosomes are
deemed to terminate translation aberrantly. Emerging evidence has pointed to a role for NMD in antiviral
restriction with a prominent role limiting replication of positive-stranded RNA viruses, however, a role for NMD in
DNA virus restriction, such as KSHV, was unknown. We recently reported the discovery that NMD is a cell-
intrinsic restriction mechanism for DNA viruses and demonstrated that it imposes a significant restriction on the
KSHV lifecycle in PEL cells. Our data demonstrate that NMD-dependent restriction is linked both to the regulation
of the unfolded protein response (UPR) as well as targeted degradation of the main KSHV transcription factor,
RTA. Building upon these observations our central hypothesis is that NMD restricts KSHV reactivation by
targeting key viral mRNAs as well as cellular transcripts in pathways important for viral gene expression and that
the virus antagonizes NMD through viral-encoded mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, we propose an
integrated series of experiments aimed at determining the interactions between NMD and KSHV. In Aim 1, we
will investigate how NMD-dependent regulation of the UPR pathway regulates the KSHV lifecycle. In Aim 2, we
will investigate a class of KSHV mRNAs that escape NMD despite harboring sequence features that should
render them NMD-susceptible. In Aim 3, we will determine the mechanism by which KSHV-encoded proteins
inhibit NMD. Completion of these studies is expected to determine how NMD restricts the KSHV lifecycle as well
as the mechanisms the virus employs to antagonize it. These will represent fundamental new insights into how
DNA virus infection is regulated by cell-intrinsic mechanisms and can be harnessed for the development of new
therapeutic strategies."

Lentiviruses infect both activated/dividing CD4+ T cells and terminally differentiated/nondividing myeloid cells
during the course of their pathogenesis. As we previously reported, host SAMHD1 dNTPase restricts viral
reverse transcription step specifically in nondividing myeloid cells by depleting cellular dNTPs whereas HIV-2
and some SIVs counteract SAMHD1 by proteosomal degradation through their accessary proteins (e.g. Vpx).
In this renewal, we aim to reveal noble mechanistic strategies that lentiviruses employ for their myeloid cell
infection and rapid evolution/escape. First, lentiviruses encode an additional polypurine track (PPT) sequence,
called central PPT (cPPT), that locates at the center of the viral genome and is used for the additional initiation
of the (+) strand DNA synthesis. We previously reported that the concomitant initiation of the (+) strand DNA
synthesis from both PPT and cPPT compensates the kinetically delayed HIV-1 reverse transcription in
nondividing cells with limited dNTP pools by cutting the size of the (+) strand DNA synthesis from PPT by half.
In Aim 1, we will test our hypothesize that the additional cPPT of HIV-1 allows HIV-1 to overcome the
SAMHD1-mediated dNTP depletion and complete the (+) strand DNA synthesis even in nondividing myeloid
cells without accessary proteins counteracting SAMHD1. Second, we previously reported that the uniquely
tight dNTP binding affinity of HIV-1 RT mechanistically contributes to its catalytic capability to execute DNA
synthesis even at low dNTP concentrations, which enables HIV-1 to replicate in myeloid cells with very low
dNTP pools. Importantly, we also reported that this tight dNTP binding affinity enables HIV-1 RT to efficiently
extend mismatch primer post misinsertion, compared to other retroviral RTs, which is responsible for the highly
error prone DNA synthesis of HIV-1 RT. Based on these observations, we propose to solve the X-ray structure
of HIV-1 RT ternary complex with mismatch primer, which will elucidate the structural nature of the highly error
prone HIV-1 replication machinery which is important for viral evolution and escape. Third, while lethal
mutagenesis has been observed in other RNA viruses, it remains unclear that the lethal mutagenesis of HIV-1
and lentiviruses can be achieved by pharmacological means. Triphosphate (TP) of Molnupiravir, b-d-N4
hydroxycytidine (NHC) prodrug, is a ribonucleotide substrate and an RNA mutagen for RNA-dependent RNA
polymerases of multiple RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2, which induces viral lethal mutagenesis. Excitingly,
our biochemical data demonstrate that host cellular RNA polymerase II also incorporates NHC-TP during RNA
synthesis, supporting the likelihood of the NHC-TP incorporation into cellular RNAs by host RNA polymerases.
Since lentivirus RNA genomes are synthesized by host DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II, we hypothesize
that NHC may be able to induce lethal mutagenesis in lentiviruses. Overall, this renewal application focuses on
elucidating the unique mechanistic and structural elements of lentivirus replication machinery, ultimately aiming
at developing novel antiviral concepts and tools."

 The brain's ability to properly process information is dependent on the ability of neuronal networks to
synchronize and generate oscillations in the gamma band (30-80 Hz). The ability of neuronal networks to
generate proper gamma oscillations matures slowly. Developing networks are susceptible to environmental
insults that could alter their development leading to abnormal oscillations. Abnormalities in gamma oscillations
are implicated in the pathology of mental health disorders including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In many
of these disorders, dysregulated inhibition is thought to give rise to abnormalities in network function. Fast spiking
interneurons (FSI) are a subset of GABAergic inhibitory neurons known to be crucial for the proper generation
of gamma oscillations. Abnormal FSI function has been observed in multiple animal models of schizophrenia.
Rodent models using antagonists of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) mimic many of the phenotypes
observed in schizophrenia including the late age onset of cognitive deficits and abnormalities in gamma
oscillations. Inhibition of NMDARs can also lead to abnormalities in FSI maturation and physiology, but the impact
of NMDAR antagonists on the ability of FSIs' to generate coordinated network activity remains poorly understood.
 The objective of this proposal is to determine the role of NMDARs in the capacity of FSIs to generate
and sustain coordinated network activity. The short-term training goals for the F99 phase of this proposal are
to determine how NMDARs influence FSIs' maturation and physiology leading to impaired network function. This
will be achieved by using microelectrode arrays to measure and manipulate synchronous network activity in
brain sections obtained from adult animals after pharmacological blockade of NMDARs. I will use protein
quantification through western blots and immunohistochemistry to identify changes in proteins that could
contribute to the physiological impairment of FSIs. The F99 phase will provide a foundation for the K00 phase in
which I will focus on determining how the intrinsic properties of FSIs allow them to generate and maintain
synchronous network activity. A combination of single cell, network recordings, in vivo manipulation of FSIs'
activity, and in silico network modeling will be incorporated to identify the different properties that contribute to
synchronize network activity. The F99 and K00 training phases will provide a strong foundation for my long-term
goal of becoming an independent academic researcher focused on determining how neurons participate in
neuronal networks and the impact of environmental insults.
 This proposal will help build upon our understanding of the fundamental principles that govern how
neurons interact to form functional networks. Additionally, it will help advance our understanding of the link
between molecular and network alteration underlying complex mental health disorders like schizophrenia."
10702074,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The United States is grappling with racism as an ongoing public health crisis. A salient socioenvironmental
chronic stressor in the lives of Black Americans, racism is associated with negative mental and physical health
outcomes. The integrity of the medial temporal hippocampal (MTH) system is modifiable by extrinsic experiential
factors, which can also increase its vulnerability. Opposite modulators of this system include cardiorespiratory
fitness and chronic stress, which are differentially associated with pattern separation, a neurocomputational pro-
cess reliant on the hippocampus that is vital for disambiguating highly similar stimuli during memory encoding.
Our lab has shown that increased cardiorespiratory fitness positively impacts the MTH system in both young and
older adults. In contrast, animal models and human neuroimaging studies of socioenvironmental chronic stress
have shown extensive structural and functional reorganization of this system. The hippocampal long-axis also
shows affective (anterior) and cognitive (posterior) differentiation, suggesting a neural substrate perturbed in
mood disorders and by chronic stress. There is evidence of MTH neurocognitive deficits in young adulthood
related to acute stress and mood disorders, but this has not been investigated as a consequence of chronic
stress. The negative impact of racism may explain disparities in the severity and chronicity of mood disorders in
Black Americans. In Aim 1, we demonstrate that 1) greater cardiorespiratory fitness predicts increased MTH
cortical thickness in young but not older adults and 2) greater perceived discrimination predicts reduced MTH
volume in a diverse group of older adults. In Aim 2 we hypothesize that greater perceived racism will be associ-
ated with MTH neurocognitive deficits in Black young adults. Technical training will focus on gaining expertise in
task-based high-resolution fMRI and advanced multivariate statistical modeling of behavioral and fMRI data.
Thus, in relation to greater perceived racism, we seek to behaviorally examine associations with spatial and non-
spatial pattern separation performance. Next, we will conduct advanced multivariate statistical modeling to quan-
tify whether greater perceived racism modulates fMRI activity associated with a NIMH Research Domain Criteria
correlate of hippocampal function, the Mnemonic Similarity Task. Finally, in Aim 3 we propose to identify a post-
doctoral mentor with expertise in mood disorders, chronic stress, and/or neuroinflammation who can train me in
experimental design and data analysis using modalities such as Positron Emission Tomography to investigate
neuroinflammation, due to its well-established link to stressors.The broad, long term goal is to build brain health
equity research capacity, identifying modifiable or mitigating factors of chronic stress due to intersecting margin-
alized identities. Finally, this proposal seeks to address the BRAIN Initiative’s Scientific Review and High Priority
Research Area for using multimodal methods to investigate the human brain in relation to behavioral and cogni-
tive outcomes, answers a recent call by the NIMH to investigate socioenvironmental stressors and mitigating
factors, and a push by the NIH to investigate how social determinants of health impact healthy living."

In the United States, English is the primary language of instruction and testing in most schools. However, many
bilingual students entering US schools learned foundational concepts in a language other than English and might
be at a developmental disadvantage when expected to build on this knowledge. It has been widely debated in
the literature which concepts are stored as language-specific memories and how bilinguals might access this
information in their other language. In this proposal, I will investigate how the bilingual brain processes
foundational knowledge that is thought to be affected by language experience. In Aim 1, I used event-related
potentials (ERPs) to understand how foundational arithmetic concepts, namely memorized multiplication facts,
are processed in each of a bilingual’s languages. My research revealed that fluent bilingual adults and children
elicit similar brain responses, suggesting equivalent access to these facts from memory, in both languages. This
data suggests that bilinguals may have overlapping cortical representations of facts in both languages. In Aim
2, I will directly test this by using a neuroimaging method with better localization than ERPs, specifically functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I will investigate whether children have shared or separate cortical
representations of multiplication facts in their two languages. My pre-doctoral training will give me expertise in
complementary brain imaging methodologies with precision in time (ERPs) and space (fMRI) for a more complete
understanding of brain development. I will also gain an interdisciplinary perspective intersecting child
development, bilingualism, language, and math cognition. In my doctoral work, I use multiplication facts as a
unique tool in assessing bilingual memory and processing. However, as a finite set of memorized concepts,
multiplication facts may be processed differently than other concepts in bilingual memory. In Aim 3, I will expand
my training to understand language dependent memory more broadly, and explore how the dynamics of the
bilingual experience modulates learning and retrieval of foundational knowledge. For example, students learning
English as a second language score on average 40 points lower than fluent English speakers on the nation’s
standard science assessment. This disparity in performance may leave second language learners at a long-term
disadvantage as they build on this foundational knowledge. Through this fellowship I aim to become a
developmental cognitive neuroscientist versed in multiple research methodologies and an interdisciplinary
approach to science. Ultimately, I aim to establish my own research lab to understand the brain basis of language
dependent memory in bilinguals. I hope to not only train future generations of students, but also spearhead
advancements in basic research that will benefit bilingual education and child development for the 21% of the
U.S. population that is bilingual."

Malaria is an important cause of illness and death worldwide, with most of these deaths resulting from
Plasmodium falciparum infection. The signs and symptoms of human malaria results from the asexual
replication of parasites in human red blood cells. During this clinically important blood stage, P. falciparum
parasites divide by schizogony – a process wherein components for several daughter cells are produced
within a common cytoplasm and then segmentation, a synchronized cytokinesis, produces individual
invasive daughters. The generation of the invasive daughter parasites, known as merozoites, occurs with
high fidelity, ensuring that each daughter has a single nucleus and the required organelles. The molecular
mechanism underlying this high fidelity of nuclear and organellar partitioning is incompletely understood in
Plasmodium.
Studies in the related Apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii identified a family of proteins, referred to
as striated fiber assemblins (SFAs), that are critical for parasite cell division. The SFAs are hypothesized to
form a connection between the centrosome of dividing nuclei and the newly forming apical ends of the two
daughter parasites during T. gondii endodyogeny. The P. falciparum orthologs of the SFAs, PfSFA1 and
PfSFA2, have been reported to be dispensable in a genome-wide transposon screen. In contrast to this
data, we demonstrate that these two proteins are essential for asexual replication in P. falciparum. Based
on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that PfSFA1 and PfSFA2 localize to a filament-like structure during
parasite segmentation. In the current proposal, we will test this hypothesize in a series of microscopy
assays. Furthermore, we will also evaluate the function of PfSFA1 and PfSFA2 by characterizing parasite
arrest and morphologic defects following inducible knockout. To gain a more complete understanding of the
molecular functions of PfSFA1 and PfSFA2, we will determine the direct protein interactions by co-
immunoprecipitation and the indirect or transient interactions by proximity labeling. By determining a robust
protein interaction network for the Plasmodium SFAs, we will establish the foundation to understand their
molecular function. We hypothesize that the SFAs proteins are critical for organization of segmentation
during the asexual replication of P. falciparum. Together, the proposed studies will interrogate the function
of these two essential proteins and directly identify their role during P. falciparum segmentation."
10816606,"Persistence of the latent HIV reservoir in people living with HIV (PLWH) remains the critical barrier to an HIV
cure. Numerous reservoir reduction and control studies have met with only limited success due to our profound
lack of understanding of the cellular mechanisms that allow the HIV reservoir to persist during antiretroviral
therapy (ART). The goals of this proposal and RFA AI-22-025 are to define the characteristics of the HIV
reservoir enabling cell death resistance and to determine whether these mechanisms impact reservoir
reduction strategies in PLWH. Previous studies have examined the viral reservoir from the aspect of the
integrated provirus, including viral diversity, intactness, and integration site, but have not been able to directly
define potential cell death resistance mechanisms that perpetuate the viral reservoir. Similarly, challenges in
identifying and characterizing resting infected cells ex vivo, including rarity, heterogeneity, and absence of a
defining phenotypic marker, have limited our ability to determine how the HIV reservoir is maintained under
ART. To address these issues, we developed a novel single cell strategy to identify HIV+ cells via integrated
proviral DNA with simultaneous epigenetic and cell surface profiling (Assayfor Transposase Accessible
Chromatinsequencing with cell surface profiling and viral alignments,V-ASAPseq). Using this strategy, we
have directly profiled the HIV reservoir in ART treated PLWH at the single cell level, finding extensive reservoir
heterogeneity within and between individuals, but the potential for shared regulatory characteristics directly
relating to cell death resistance. Here, we will apply V-ASAPseq and V-TEAseq (transcriptome, epigenome,
and surface profiling) to define cell death resistance mechanisms of the HIV reservoir. Our central
hypothesis is that reservoir persistence over time under ART and after immunotherapeutic challenge is
associated with targetable cellular features, some of which are shared and others distinct between
subpopulations of HIV+ CD4+ T cells. In Aim 1 we will determine reservoir-associated changes in cell death
resistance signatures over time, between anatomical compartments and after reactivation. In Aim 2, we will
determine the epigenetic and transcriptional features of HIV+ cells that drive cell death susceptibility in vitro
and persistence in vivo after reservoir-targeting immunotherapies from human clinical trials. Together these
studies will define targetable features of reservoir persistence and cell death both at rest, during ART, and in
the context of reservoir-targeting immunotherapies with the ultimate goal of reducing the HIV reservoir."
10909340,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a common and highly aggressive form of brain cancer in adults with a dismal
prognosis and limited therapeutic options. A critical component of GBM malignancy derives from the distinct
population of glioma stem cells (GSCs) that function to promote and maintain malignancy through their capacity
for self-renewal, cellular adaptation and multipotency. These stem-like cells engage in a synergistic relationship
with the surrounding microenvironment to promote tumor progression and are key drivers of intratumoral
heterogeneity, immune-suppression, and therapy resistance. Targeting GSCs and mechanisms that drive the
stem-like phenotype presents a promising avenue for targeted therapeutics.
 The broad goal of this proposal is to understand the cell-intrinsic mechanisms driving maintenance of a
unique, immunosuppressive GSC subset, identify cellular vulnerabilities associated with immunosuppressive
GBM cells, and develop preclinical therapeutics to target these cells. We will achieve this goal by utilizing our
validated GSC cell models, state-of-the art single-cell sequencing technology, and cutting-edge spatially
resolved omics platforms applied to clinical GBM specimens, and advanced molecular in vitro techniques to
define immunosuppressive tumor cell populations and determine the transcriptomic and metabolic changes
associated with these cell populations that are amenable to therapeutic targeting.
 Our preliminary findings demonstrate that TGF-beta type II receptor (TGFBR2) signaling induces a
TGFBR2high subset of GSCs that co-opt certain immunosuppressive mechanisms associated with and utilized by
regulatory T cells (Tregs) to exert immunosuppressive behavior. In the F99 phase, we will investigate the
potential for boosting the anti-tumor immune response by targeting this specific subset of TGFBR2-induced
immunosuppressive GSCs endowed with Treg-like capabilities. To do so, we will utilize inducible shRNA
constructs and a clinically translatable small-molecule drug to inhibit TGFBR2 in orthotopic tumor allografts in
immune-competent mice and analyze the effects on tumor growth, immune cell infiltration and function, and
cooperativity with check point inhibitor therapy. In the K00 phase, we will conduct spatially resolved
transcriptomics and metabolomics on patient GBM tissue specimens to identify potential metabolic vulnerabilities
in immunosuppressive GBM cells. Metabolic inhibitors will be utilized to exploit candidate vulnerabilities in an
attempt to attenuate the transcriptomic and functional immune-suppressive characteristics of these cells.
Subsequently, validated metabolic vulnerabilities will be targeted in vivo to assess the effects on tumor growth
and the anti-tumor immune response. Our proposed methods of pharmacological TGFBR2 inhibition and
metabolic exploitation will inform the development of novel strategies to reprogram the GBM microenvironment
and enhance anti-tumor immune responses when combined with current emerging immunotherapeutics (e.g.
checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cell technology, vaccines)."

Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. The two institutions have a history of successfully mentoring
URM/DA students and our experienced Program Faculty mentor both graduate and undergraduate students.
PREP@UC will fill a gap in PREP program coverage in the Appalachian region and a need expressed to us
by students and institutions from our PREP program service area. Cincinnati sits at the edge of Appalachia,
a region that is considered economically distressed, and the city is home to large Black and Appalachian
populations and a growing Hispanic population, all with high rates of poverty. When URM/DA students from
our region make it to university they frequently attend institutions that lack a PhD or masters level
infrastructure for career progression. The goal of PREP@UC is to enable these individuals to enter doctoral
programs and then progress to careers in biomedical research. To achieve this goal, we propose an evidence-
based program incorporating established educational concepts and tailored learning. PREP Scholars will
have individualized mentoring and training plans (IDPs) designed to teach research skills, increase academic
preparedness, build internal scientific identity and build external credentials needed for doctoral studies. The
program goal will be met through the following aims. Aim 1. Empower Scholars with the confidence and
sense of self-efficacy needed to succeed in doctoral studies by providing strong social support and
mentoring. Scholars will have a social support network and mentoring team to help them adjust to the
academic environment, develop confidence they can succeed as a scientist and build enthusiasm for this
career. Aim 2. Develop Scholars' research skills using intensive mentored experiential learning. Each
Scholar will be matched with a highly qualified faculty mentor and work on their own project in the mentor's
lab. They will receive training in all aspects of scientific research and will experience life as a graduate student.
Aim 3. Increase Scholars' readiness for biomedical doctoral programs through individually tailored
academic preparation. Activities will include taking a graduate level course, training in critiquing scientific
papers, oral presentations, scientific writing and preparation of graduate school applications. Through Aims
1-3, we will significantly increase Scholars' internal readiness, and academic preparedness for entry into a
doctoral program. PREP@UC is unique in its focus on Black and Appalachian populations from our region

10926886,"ABSTRACT – CAREER ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM (CEP)
The purpose of the Mayo Clinic SPORE in Ovarian Cancer is to stimulate, organize and facilitate rigorous
translational research that will meaningfully reduce the burden of ovarian cancer. A critical part of this process
is to increase the quality and depth of the translational investigator base in ovarian cancer. During Years 6-10
of funding, five individuals received Career Enhancement Program (CEP) awards and were supported with 1-2
years of funding (one awardee with 2 years of funding; four with 1 year of funding), mentoring teams, and full
access to SPORE resources. Our awardees have been highly successful, with 39 peer-reviewed manuscripts
published by Year 6-10 awardees and 3 have successfully secured subsequent funding. All five Year 6-10
awardees relied upon the Biostatisics and Bioinformatics Core (Core C), four awardees also partnered with the
Biospecimens and Patient Registry (Core B), and three with the Animal Models Core (Core D). The ultimate
objectives of the Career Enhancement Program (CEP) continue to be the identification and mentoring of new
and developing investigators in ovarian cancer who demonstrate clear potential to become independent
translational researchers as well as attracting established scientists who wish to refocus on ovarian cancer.
The CEP provides up to $100,000 for one year of support ($50,000 from SPORE funds and a matching
$50,000 from Mayo Clinic Cancer Center); a second year is possible based on progress and continued
translational trajectory. Special emphasis is placed on attracting highly qualified individuals underrepresented
in medicine, including women, minorities, and persons with disabilities. Identifying and selecting CEP
awardees is accomplished through a rigorous review process, followed by intense mentoring, integration into
ongoing SPORE activities and close oversight of each individual’s progress. In addition to a primary mentor,
awardees have complementary mentors in clinical, basic or population sciences necessary to ensure
development of a translational research career. This capitalizes on numerous strengths present within the
Mayo environment. The CEP directorship reports to the Executive Committee of the Mayo Clinic Ovarian
Cancer SPORE. During the next funding period, the Ovarian SPORE CEP will continue to maintain: (1) A
stringent candidate selection system; (2) comprehensive trainee guidance by a primary mentor; (3) support
through a scientific mentoring group (each awardee’s Individual Trainee Mentorship Committee) comprised of
investigators with expertise in each awardee‘s area of interest; and (4) full integration into the SPORE,
including access to all scientific Cores. Mayo Clinic provides an exceptional environment for developing
careers in translational research in ovarian cancer. The CEP allows us to identify, mentor, and support young
investigators who will become future leaders in ovarian cancer research."

Administrative Core (AC), as a team from all three institutions, are jointly responsible for supporting all MVTCP
components and investigators through overall management and coordination of resources, communication and
engagement. Importantly, the AC fosters, manages and supports interactions among and within the partner
institutions, components and investigators, internal and external advisory committees, and the National Cancer
Institute (NCI). The administrative teams from the partner institutions interact and collaborate extensively to
enhance productivity and support the needs of the MVTCP. The AC is comprised of the Principal Investigators
(PIs) from all three institutions, Samuel Adunyah, PhD [Meharry Medical College (MMC), contact PI], Duane
Smoot, MD (MMC, Co-PI), Tuya Pal, MD [Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC), contact PI], Ann Richmond,
PhD (VICC, Co-PI), Margaret Whalen, PhD [Tennessee State University (TSU), contact PI], and Venkataswarup
Tiriveedhi, MD, PhD (TSU, Co-PI). An experienced administrative team from each institution provides day-to-
day administrative oversight and supports the PIs and the Partnership. Through effective leadership, the AC
team 1) provides vision and support as well as implements the overall direction of the Partnership; 2) facilitates
new and ongoing review processes of Research projects funded through the Partnership; 3) ensures, promotes
and actively coordinates integration and synergy across the Cores and Shared Resources to support the projects
and grow additional disparities-focused efforts; 4) collaborates with institutional leadership to ensure appropriate
levels of institutional support; and 5) coordinates and prepares required annual reports and any additional
required reporting and data for the NCI, in close coordination with the Planning and Evaluation Core. The AC
develops and coordinates activities in support of planning and evaluation, engages in faculty recruitment and
mentoring, develops and executes workshops, seminars, and the Annual MVTCP Cancer Health Disparities

Cancer Center/Tennessee State University Cancer Partnership (MVTCP), and utilize evaluation activities to
ensure that the MVTCP is successful in contributing to the broad goals of the Comprehensive Partnerships to
Advance Cancer Health Equity (CPACHE) program. The information we garner through our evaluation
processes will be used to guide the investment of resources into projects, programs, and institutional-level
strategies such as recruitment and leveraging of resources that support the goals of the partnership. At a time
in which cancer health disparities and inequities in research and education remain as major barriers to improving
health and quality of life for all, ensuring that the efforts of the MVTCP are successful is paramount. Conducting
high-quality, continuous evaluation of the MVTCP provides the opportunity to document our efforts, measure our
successes, and attend to our weaknesses for the purposes of program improvement. During the past funding
cycle, the PEC worked with all cores of the MVTCP to develop logic models that are used to identify program
theory, as well as the measurable outputs and outcomes of each core. The metrics identified through this process
were then harmonized with the CPACHE-wide evaluation indicators to create an integrated outcome framework
designed to capture the broader impact of the MVTCP. In the next funding cycle, we will build on this work to
develop evaluation tools and processes to ensure high-quality implementation of funded projects, integration
among projects and cores, and dissemination of methods and findings that demonstrate the impact of the
MVTCP. The work of the evaluation core will be guided by the following aims: 1) foster on-going coordination
facilitated by the Administrative Core, with the Internal Advisory Committee and Program Steering Committee to
ensure the MVTCP is receiving expert feedback and guidance on cores, projects, and the performance of the
MVTCP as a whole; 2) use a combination of established and innovative evaluation techniques to assess the
MVTCP and its accomplishment of short- and long-term goals; 3) develop a culture of evaluation within the
MVTCP that is committed to the use of data to support decision making, drive quality improvement, and inform

10925322,"Project 2 – Project Summary
Over 60% of adults are overweight or obese. Obesity is particularly problematic in women who experience
unique physiological changes over their lifespan (e.g., menopause). While many weight-loss strategies exist,
weight regain after weight loss remains the largest barrier to successfully treating obesity. Regular exercise is
one of the most potent strategies for preventing weight regain after weight loss. We previously developed a
preclinical model showing that regular exercise reduces caloric intake during weight regain after weight loss.
Importantly, the exercise-induced reduction in caloric intake is observed in males and ovariectomized females
but not in intact/cycling female rats. In males, we have shown that regular exercise suppresses the drive to
overeat and potentiates energy expenditure above and beyond the cost of the exercise bout. The overall
objective of this proposal is to determine how exercise counters the biological drive to regain weight
and elucidate the sexual dimorphic response. To achieve this objective, we propose to investigate known
mechanisms of appetite and energy expenditure regulation that are thought to mediate the sex differences and
explore a novel role for the tryptophan-kynurenine (TRP-KYN) pathway in regulating energy balance in this
context.
In Aim 1, we will examine sex differences, the effect of ovariectomy, and the impact of exercise on
post-prandial gut hormone responses and eating behaviors and during weight regain. We hypothesize
that exercise is modulating gut hormone peptides to exert beneficial feeding effects during weight regain after
weight loss and that the presence of estrogen interferes with this modulation in intact females to sustain weight
regain.
In Aim 2, we will determine the impact of ovariectomy and estrogen add-back on exercise-induced
energy expenditure during weight regain after weight loss. We hypothesize that the exercise-induced
increase in energy expenditure is linked to its ability to enhance the capacity to oxidize fat, which is inherently
higher in females due to estrogen. We suspect the presence of estrogen in intact females and ovariectomized
females with estrogen add-back will diminish the impact of exercise on dietary fat oxidation and energy
expenditure.
In addition to testing these hypotheses, our studies will provide valuable information about TRP-KYN pathway
metabolites and their role in mediating the effects of sex differences, the loss of ovarian function, and the
beneficial effects of exercise training. Observations from these studies will provide insight into the
mechanisms of the sexual dimorphic response to exercise during weight regain and identify novel targets and
strategies to facilitate weight loss maintenance more effectively."
10925326,"The menopausal transition, an unavoidable aging-related phenomenon in women, is accompanied by
increased abdominal adiposity and the concomitant incidence of adipose-related comorbidities, but the
underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. Project 3 of the University of Colorado Specialized Center of Research
Excellence on Sex Differences (SCORE) is based on the premise that alterations in the cellular composition of
adipose tissue are responsible for the shift in body fat distribution and worsening metabolic health observed after
menopause. We previously discovered a novel lineage of adipocytes in the major white adipose depots of mice
and humans generated from hematopoietic stem cells rather than conventional mesenchymal precursors. In
mice, these hematopoietic stem cell-derived adipocytes (HSCDAs) were detected in greater numbers in
abdominal fat depots, suggesting a critical role in influencing metabolic health. Furthermore, estrogen receptor
alpha (ERa) knockdown or ovariectomy significantly increased HSCDA production.
 Recently, two laboratories have presented evidence that diet-induced obesity requires the interaction
between the metabolic intermediate, kynurenine (Kyn) and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Preliminary
data from the Klemm laboratory shows that the enzyme that catalyzes kynurenine production, indoleamine
dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) in adipose tissue, and the AhR are expressed at significantly higher levels in HSCDAs
than other adipocyte populations. Thus, we hypothesize that the loss of estrogen signaling via
ER⍺ promotes the production of HSCDAs and their subsequent production of Kyn (via IDO1) and AhR,
which promotes weight gain, increased adiposity, and related metabolic dysfunction. Three specific aims
will address this hypothesis: Aim 1: test whether HSCDA-targeted deletion of IDO1 or AhR will suppress
increases in body weight, adiposity, and other adipose tissue-related endpoints due to knockdown of ERa in
adipocytes (collaboration with Project 2); Aim 2: test whether targeted ablation of HSCDAs decreases Kyn, IDO1
and AhR and prevents changes in body weight, adiposity and other parameters induced by ERa knockdown
(collaboration with Project 2); and Aim 3: test whether suppression of estrogen production in premenopausal
women stimulates HSDCA production and their production of IDO1 and AhR, and is prevented by estrogen
replacement (collaboration with Project 1). Successful completion of these aims will demonstrate that HSCDAs
are a primary intermediate in the regulation of body weight and adiposity influenced by ERa signaling.
Additionally, these studies will demonstrate the potential benefits of targeting kynurenine metabolism in the
context of gonadal aging. Since HSCDAs are produced from hematopoietic rather than mesenchymal progenitor
cells, they offer the opportunity to modulate not only body-wide metabolism, but also adipocyte metabolic
phenotypes associated with changes in sex hormone production."

10913457,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Cytokinetic abscission is the physical separation of daughter cells that concludes mitosis. Premature abscission
in the presence of incompletely segregated chromosomes can result in chromosome breaks that give rise to
DNA damage and micronuclei which are hallmarks of cancer. To ensure that the onset of cytokinetic abscission
is synchronized with the completion of upstream mitotic events, cells have evolved a cell cycle checkpoint known
as the abscission checkpoint. Cells arrest abscission in the presence of mitotic errors such as trapped DNA in
the intercellular bridge, mis formed nuclear pores, under-replicated DNA, and tension at the intercellular bridge.
In this proposal we take an innovative multidisciplinary approach that combines structure function studies with
cell-based assays to address major outstanding questions underlying abscission checkpoint regulation, including
how cells sense checkpoint triggers, and how protective activities are coupled with abscission. In Focus 1, we
will use a structure-function approach to understand the mechanism whereby the ESCRT abscission machinery
recruits and triggers novel cellular autophagy pathways. In Focus 2 we will examine how the metabolic status of
a cell can lead to post-translational modification of abscission checkpoint proteins to alter the fidelity of
abscission, providing the first direct links between glucose metabolism and abscission checkpoint function.
Taken together, this work will provide essential mechanistic, molecular-level insight into how cells promote
faithful abscission, how the mistakes in abscission can lead to the development of cancer, and ultimately, suggest
therapeutic strategies for combatting cancer cell proliferation."
10914817,"ABSTRACT
Chronic pain is a debilitating condition for which there is a pressing need for safe, effective treatments. These
patients experience enhanced pain sensations and often experience pain when innocuous stimuli are
presented. However, the neural basis for this increased sensitivity is poorly understood. Here, we propose to
investigate the neural circuit basis for central hyperexcitability that may contribute to persistent pain. We will be
combining novel physiological, and pharmacological approaches to address our goals. Using existing
transgenic mouse lines, we can express the calcium indicator GCamp6s in all excitatory spinal neurons. We
can then use our novel ex vivo skin-spinal cord preparation and 2-photon calcium imaging to examine activity
in the spinal dorsal horn activity to cutaneous stimulation in naïve mice and those following injury. While this
approach will allow us to image the responses of many (~200) neurons simultaneously, it does not allow us to
identify different types of neurons, thereby severely hampering the degree to which the data can be
interpreted. Now, we have developed a novel approach to circumvent this limitation through post hoc
pharmacological identification of cell types. The underlying concept is that most neurons express one or more
Gq-coupled G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) whose activation results in the release of Ca2+ from internal
stores. In the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) to silence neuronal activity, the only neurons that show a Ca2+
transient in response to a given agonist are those that express its receptor. This approach, which we have
termed CICADA (Cell-type Identification by Ca2+-coupled Activity through Drug Activation), allows us to
unambiguously define cell types based on their responses to a series of GPCR agonists. Now we are uniquely
poised to address specific questions about the function of spinal circuitry and how the functional properties of
these circuits are altered following injury. In the first Aim we will extend and validate this analysis with the goal
of developing a complete repertoire dorsal horn subtypes that can be identified in population imaging studies.
While neurons respond to different types of sensory stimuli (e.g., heat, cold, and mechanical), how this coding
is manifest across neuronal populations is unclear. In the second Aim we will catalog functional response
properties across populations of CICADA-defined cell subtypes. In the third Aim we will examine the effects of
capsaicin induced acute central sensitization on these subpopulations. The chronification of pain is thought to
be associated with long-term changes in central network activity that perpetuate hyperalgesic states. In the
fourth Aim we will identify the CICADA-defined cell types that show altered activity in the context of chronic
pain using the spared nerve injury (SNI) as a model. The studies we are proposing here will begin to identify
specific spinal circuitry involved in central sensitization and investigate how these specific microcircuits are
altered in conditions of acute and chronic injury. This knowledge may elucidate new therapeutic targets for the
treatment of pain, which is the long-term goal of research of our program."
10911898,"PROJECT ABSTRACT:
The ability to measure and quantify the composition and abundance of various metabolites in biological
samples, also referred to as metabolomics, provides a unique window into the complex biological
processes at different scales. So far, the field of metabolomics has mainly been driven by technologies
based on mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. These
technologies, although powerful, only measure metabolite profiles in homogenized biological extracts,
e.g., biofluids or dissected tissues, thus losing the spatial information of the underlying metabolic
processes. As spatial heterogeneity is a hallmark of metabolism, especially in complex biological
systems such as animals and humans, obtaining spatially resolved metabolomics has been a dream of
many biomedical scientists and engineers. In recent years, MS imaging (MSI) has emerged as a tool of
choice for imaging metabolomics, which allows for the generation of spatially localized metabolite
profiles from tissue sections. One major limitation of MSI is that it requires post-mortem or invasive
tissue sampling, thus unable to probe metabolism at the most physiologically relevant states. This has
limited its translation to human studies. MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is another alternative for
imaging metabolomics. It combines the powers of MRI and NMR spectroscopy to produce spatially
resolved tissue metabolite profiles, noninvasively. However, MRSI is highly limited in its poor spatial
resolutions. Furthermore, most MRSI studies only target a single nucleus (e.g., 1H), thus limited in the
number of molecular species measured. The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop a
research program that will pave a path towards in vivo imaging of tissue metabolomics.
Specifically, we aim to develop an unprecedented high-resolution multinuclear MRSI technology that
can simultaneously map a large number of metabolites in vivo, synergizing advancements in ultrahigh-
field MRI instrumentation, fast data acquisition, and machine learning driven computational imaging
techniques. We also propose a novel multimodal MRSI and MSI imaging framework for validating our
multinuclear MRSI technology and integrating two complementary biochemical imaging modalities for
tissue metabolic profiling. Novel computational approaches will be developed to analyze the high-
dimensional metabolomic data. Success of the proposed research will establish a new paradigm for
generating and analyzing imaging metabolomics data. This paradigm will transform metabolomics into
a powerful noninvasive and tissue specific technology (from an invasive and nonspatial-specific one)
for studying metabolism in living animals and humans. These advances will enable new means to
unravel the metabolic basis of normal physiological functions and different diseases, inspiring
developments of new biomarkers, novel treatments, disease prognosis and management strategies."

This application is a competitive renewal of the Multidisciplinary Training Program in Lung Disease
(T32HL007749). This training program, continuously funded since 1993, has an excellent track record of
preparing M.D. and Ph.D. scientists for successful careers in biomedical research. The program proposes to
continue to support 9 postdoctoral fellows (M.D., Ph.D., and M.D.-PhD.), each for a 2-3 year training period.
The rationale for this training program is that 1) respiratory disease and critical illness are tremendous causes
of morbidity and mortality, 2) significant knowledge gaps have prevented the development of disease-
modifying or -reversing therapies in the field, 3) the diseases of the respiratory tract and critical illness are
propelled by complex processes in need of multidisciplinary approaches, and 4) the field faces a threatened
pipeline of diverse investigators committed to careers studying respiratory disease and critical illness. The
objective of the program is to produce outstanding biomedical scientists who investigate the manifestations,
mechanisms, prevention, and treatment of lung disease and critical illness. The design of our training program
includes 1) recruitment of talented and diverse candidates committed to careers in research; 2) an immersive
and individualized training plan for program trainees; and 3) deliberate preparation and positioning of program
graduates for successful post-award professional outcomes. All trainees participate in a directly mentored
research experience, supported by a research advisory committee. Our program’s mentors and advisors are
truly multidisciplinary, representing a cohesive network of faculty from across the medical school and
university. Trainees all participate in a core didactic curriculum related to foundations of pathophysiology,
research design, training in responsible research conduct, career planning, communication skills, and grant
writing. This core curriculum is complemented by additional coursework and workshops tailored to trainees’
scientific and professional goals. Trainees have the opportunity to acquire Master's Degrees relevant to three
distinct career pathways (clinical research methods, health services research, and bioinformatics). The
investigative approaches available to trainees include disciplines applicable at the molecular, cellular, tissue,
organ, organism, and clinical population levels. A broad range of research topics is available to trainees,
including the pathobiology of acute and chronic lung disease, cutting-edge techniques of molecular
phenotyping (genomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, metabolomics), data science and bioinformatics, and

10918167,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Rotator cuff repairs are amongst the most performed orthopedic surgeries (>400,000 surgeries in the US per
year) but remain a very challenging clinical problem. While surgical repair of the rotator cuff seeks to improve
shoulder function and stability, the surgical outcomes vary significantly because, pre-operatively, it is difficult
under current evaluative methods to predict which patients will benefit from surgery versus those who will not.
The focus of this project is to develop unique technology that replaces current methods to produce a rapid,
accurate assessment of rotator cuffs capable of large-scale commercial deployment.
 There is significant scientific evidence that excessive fat infiltration and atrophy of the rotator cuff muscles
lead to poor outcomes because the presence of fatty tissue limits the ability for the muscle to recover and
regenerate following tendon reconstruction. While current clinical practice utilizes magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) to evaluate fat infiltration in the rotator cuff using qualitative scoring systems, qualitative scoring has little-
to-no correlation with quantitative measures of fat infiltration and atrophy. Incorporating quantitative
measurements would dramatically improve clinical treatment decision-making; however, existing methods would
require substantial manual input and thus is not clinically viable. A fast and accurate method for segmenting the
rotator cuff muscles and fat infiltration is essential for improving outcomes and reducing unnecessary surgeries.
 During the Phase I period of this project, we successfully developed and validated a deep-learning-based
automatic algorithm for quantification of rotator cuff muscle and fatty infiltration from clinical scans. Through the
creation of an extensive digital database of both healthy and pathological rotator cuff clinical scans, we developed
a novel method to account for variability in scan coverage, which led to the establishment of key rotator cuff
muscle metrics that can be derived quickly and precisely from the MR images. We now have a prototype product
that is ready for beta-testing. In the Phase II period, we propose to perform a prospective clinical study to
determine which MRI-derived muscle metrics that best predict the outcomes of rotator cuff repair surgeries. In
Aim 1, we will partner with multiple orthopedic centers to perform pre-operative analysis of rotator cuffs that are
being considered for rotator cuff repair surgery, and then relate the pre-operative metrics with post-operative
outcomes. In Aim 2, we will develop and refine the user interface and associated metrics that will be ultimately
deployed for clinical use. Completion of this project will enable a 510(k) application for market clearance. This
project will significantly improve the accuracy of shoulder pathology assessments, thus advancing the diagnosis
and treatment of shoulder pathologies, improving the outcomes of costly orthopedic procedures, and potentially
even eliminating unnecessary procedures, all of which will improve patient care and lower the associated costs."
10932226,"Protocol Review and Monitoring System: Summary/Abstract
The goal of the HDFCCC Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) is to ensure rigorous scientific
review and monitoring of all clinical research undertaken in the HDFCCC. This is accomplished through a two-
stage process, first by disease-focused and discipline-focused site committees that undertake initial scientific
review of protocols, assessment of feasibility and projected accrual rates, and study prioritization; and then by
the Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC) that reviews scientific rationale, study design,
expected accrual rates, adequacy of biostatistical input, feasibility of study completion within an appropriate
time period, and ongoing review of scientific progress, including scientific relevance and accrual rates. As part
of its review process, the PRMC undertakes prioritization of all clinical research studies across the HDFCCC.
This provides a touchpoint to assess alignment of clinical trials with the Center-wide strategic plan and
priorities, and an opportunity to prioritize research related to the cancer burden in the catchment area, high
priority cancers, and underserved or marginalized communities."

Neonatal seizures occur in over 14,000 newborns annually in the US, and are frequently
associated with long-term deleterious consequences including intellectual disability, epilepsy,
and other neurodevelopmental disabilities. Electroencephalography (EEG) is the only reliable
means of detecting seizures; however, many Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) do not
have the capability to do EEG recordings due to the lack of skilled EEG technicians to apply gel-
based electrodes to delicate neonatal skin and acquire clean signals.
Under NIH SBIR funding, Quantum Applied Science and Research (QUASAR), a leader in
noninvasive sensor technology, in collaboration with Children’s National Hospital (CNH), a top
ranked pediatric hospital, has been developing a Neonatal EEG MOnitor (“NEMO”) device
intended as a reliable and easy-to-use EEG system that will increase availability of neonatal
EEG monitoring to hospitals that typically lack this capability. The NEMO device takes
advantage of QUASAR’s innovative dry sensing technology combined with a soft cap that is
designed for minimal impact on the infants’ wellbeing and ease of use in the hospital
environment. NEMO will lead to more neonates being screened and treated, and thus to shorter
hospital stays and improved outcomes.
Under Phase I and Phase II of this project, QUASAR and CNH have validated QUASAR’s dry
electrodes for the neonatal monitoring application in a NICU environment, demonstrating their
signal quality was comparable to that of wet electrodes, and built a prototype NEMO headset.
The main goal of the proposed Phase IIb effort is to finalize the NEMO device, validate its
performance on neonates in the NICU environment, and obtain 510(k) clearance for it. In order
to accomplish this goal, QUASAR will work with ProPharma, a regulatory consultant firm, to
establish current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and finalize the NEMO device under
cGMP. QUASAR will then complete Safety Testing, and in collaboration with CNH will conduct
a Clinical Validation to obtain the necessary data for a 510(k) submission. The final step in the
project will be a product launch in partnership with medical device manufacturers and
distributors."
10930853,"Abstract
Chronic pain is associated with substantial suffering and other co-morbidities such as depression, insomnia,
fatigue, lowered mobility, and worse quality-of-life. Most of the care of chronic pain patients occurs during
hurried primary care visits with pharmacological treatments (e.g. opioids and medications) despite mixed
evidence of efficacy and increased risk of potentially dangerous side effects, including addiction and death.
Even when these treatments are effective in reducing pain, they may not improve mental and functional status
and may actually increase depression. The need for easy access to evidence-based non-pharmacological
treatment options that include patient information and skill building would be helpful to chronic pain patients.
To address the need for non-pharmacological approaches to treating chronic pain, we proposed developing
the GEMINI platform to facilitate the delivery of online Integrative Medical Group Visits (IMGV) via video
conferencing, eliminating a major access barrier for patients with physical and/or practical limitations that
prohibit attending weekly in-person sessions. Between the online group sessions, patients use GEMINI for
mind-body home practice with the ability to select evidence-based self-care practice options based on their
own preferences and symptoms, and to gain peer support from group-based activities. The home practice and
self-management tools covering such topics as mindfulness, mind-body practices, self-management of chronic
pain, stress reduction, sleep, and nutrition. For patients, GEMINI is a unique and secure group-based
intervention, uses gamification to reward engagement, and allows users to individualize self-management
tools. For clinicians and researchers, GEMINI also has a Provider Portal, which uses daily measure tracking
and enables monitoring of patients’ symptoms, adherence to home practice, and social interactions.
Aim 1: Enhance/refine Phase I prototype based on Phase I feedback and add implementation of mostly
administrative features for managing/scheduling group visits, updating intervention content, and FHIR/SMART-
based EHR integration. A small pilot test will be conducted before starting the trial in Aim 2. Trial-related
features will be implemented first and then the software used for the trial will be “locked.” Additional feature
implementation will continue after the start of the trial, but on s separate codebase.
Aim 2: Conduct a randomized 2-arm controlled trial (N=212) to test our hypotheses that the use of the GEMINI
intervention would result in reduced pain impact, better pain-related outcomes, improved self-efficacy in pain
management, and reduced pain medication use, as compared to the comparator control group, for up to 6
months from the start of the intervention participation."
10894273,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neutrophilic asthma is a subtype of severe asthma, which has no safe and effective therapy. There is an
unmet need to delineate the mechanism of neutrophilic asthma and develop targeted and effective therapies.
Host cell-derived DNA is present in the extracellular fluid and serum. DNA represents a danger signal (danger-
associate molecular pattern-DAMP) for host cells. Recent studies suggest an important role for extracellular
DNA in mediating virus-induced asthma exacerbation. We present robust preliminary data demonstrating
increased levels of extracellular DNA, the DNA sensor IFI16 (Interferon-gamma induced protein-16) and the
DNA-IFI16 pathway-driven cytokines/chemokines in the airways from neutrophilic asthma. We developed a
mouse model of asthma where DNA induces neutrophilic inflammation in the context of an IL10-constrained
inflamed airway milieu. This phenotype requires the participation of the IFI16 signaling adapter STING. Based
upon these novel preliminary results we hypothesize that extracellular DNA induces neutrophilic asthma
through the IFI16-STING pathway in the presence of select IL10-suppressive TNFSFs. Neutrophil extracellular
traps generate DNA, which establishes a self-perpetuated mechanism of neutrophilic asthma. Under Aim 1 we
will examine the relevance of extracellular DNA for human neutrophilic asthma. We will study the generation of
airway extracellular DNA, activation of IFI16 and IL10-suppressive TNFSFs—TNF and OX40L and their
pathophysiological consequences in the airways. We will study bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), bronchial
epithelial cells and biopsy specimens from 3 study groups: 1) Neutrophilic (with and without eosinophilic)
asthma; 2) Non-neutrophilic (with and without eosinophilic) asthma; and 3) Disease controls. We will delineate
the function and importance of IFI16 for proneutrophilic biomolecules in a reductionist model in DNA-treated
airway macrophages and blood monocytes. Under Aim 2 we will study the mechanism of extracellular DNA-
induced neutrophilic asthma in mice. We will elucidate the role of IL10 and TNFSFs (TNF and OX40L) in
switching the DNA-induced defensive program to a neutrophilic inflammation program in mouse airways. We
will establish the role of IFI204 (the mouse IFI16 ortholog) and STING in neutrophilic inflammation. We will
study the effect of removal of extracellular DNA on persistence of neutrophilic asthma in mice. This project is
important because it uncovers a novel DNA-IFI16-STING mechanism of neutrophilic asthma and assesses the
therapeutic benefits of DNA and STING inhibitors, and DNA scavengers in a preclinical study."
10899642,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Most cases of atrial fibrillation (AF) arise from a combination of clinical risk factors and genetic susceptibility.
Moreover, it has recently become clear that AF can be the earliest manifestation of rare high effect size variants
associated with potentially fatal cardiac channelopathies or cardiomyopathies (CM). When inherited
arrhythmia/CM syndromes are suspected, current guidelines recommend genetic testing to enable early
detection and reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death. However, current guidelines specifically state that genetic
testing should not ordinarily be performed in patients presenting with AF alone. Thus, major knowledge gaps are
how to identify those patients in whom AF is the first sign that they possess a potentially serious underlying
genetic disease and what is the cardiac phenotype and clinical significance of those rare genetic variants.
 We are now in a position to address these issues using the NHLBI’s Trans-omics for Precision Medicine
(TOPMed) and NHGRI’s Centers for Common Disease Genomics (CCDG) resources. TOPMed has performed
whole genome sequencing (WGS) and CCDG has performed whole exome sequencing (WES) in large numbers
of subjects with common cardiovascular diseases. Currently, this includes 2,852 participants with early onset AF
(age <60 years, a group in which genetic factors may play an especially important role) from Vanderbilt
(Vanderbilt TOPMed AF Cohort=1,161, Vanderbilt CCDG AF Cohort=1,691). These participants were recruited
from Vanderbilt AF registries and have consented for potential recontact. To create a more diverse cohort, an
additional 200 African Americans with early onset AF will be prospectively recruited from Meharry Medical
College. Using these resources, Aim 1 will perform deep phenotyping to define the cardiac phenotype of AF
patients with a pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) rare variant associated with an inherited cardiomyopathy
(CM) syndrome (e.g. arrhythmogenic CM, hypertrophic CM, dilated CM; Aim 1A) or inherited arrhythmia
syndrome (e.g. Brugada Syndrome, Long QT Syndrome; Aim 1B) and compared to controls. Participants from
these defined genetic subgroups and controls will be recruited for an outpatient research visit to undergo a
cardiac MRI, rest/stress/signal-averaged ECGs, and cardiac monitoring. If an inherited arrhythmia/CM syndrome
is diagnosed, guideline-directed changes to medical care will be recommended. Aim 2 will create a prediction
tool using clinical risk factors ± an AF polygenic risk score to identify patients with AF who have a P/LP rare
genetic variant and therefore should undergo genetic testing.
 While advances in sequencing technology have improved the understanding of how rare and common
genetic variation contributes to AF susceptibility, the phenotype of AF genetic subgroups remains incompletely
defined. If genetic testing for AF is to add therapeutic value, our work to identify who should be tested and define
the clinical implications of these results in a broad AF population is needed."

Structural studies have established that naturally elicited antibodies can bind to HIV envelope (Env) over a wide
range of epitopes and angles mediated by their Fab arm (i.e. “immune complex geometry”). How this affects
antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity, especially by Natural Killer (NK) cells is unknown. Our
knowledge is limited by a poor understanding of how antibody immune complexes orchestrate antibody receptor
based signaling (specifically for Fc gamma RIIIa, FcRIIIa). The long-term goal is to acquire a more detailed
understanding of how antibodies recruit Fc mediated cellular activity and to develop novel strategies to engineer
antibodies, drugs, and vaccines that can recruit specific effector functions with maximal potency in vivo. The
objective of this proposal is to determine how immune complex geometry impacts NK cell ADCC against HIV
and IgG receptor spatiotemporal dynamics within the NK cell immune synapse (NKIS). Our central hypothesis
is that antibody geometry will modulate FcRIIIa interaction and ADCC activity in relation to immune complex
geometry. The rationale for this work is that cutting-edge microscopy observations will provide new insight into
ADCC function with immediate impacts on HIV antibody therapeutic design with applications to a broader range
of human diseases. Our central hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) Determine how immune
complex geometry influences FcgRIIIa interaction during ADCC; 2) Perform single molecule tracking of FcRIIIa
within the NKIS during ADCC; 3) Determine nanometer-scale localization of FcRIIIa and signaling kinases within
the NKIS during ADCC. We will pursue these aims using the innovative technique of MINFLUX nanoscopy, a
super-resolution fluorescence microscopy technique that is capable of 1- to 3-nm spatial resolutions in both 2-
and 3-dimensions as well as sub-millisecond tracking of single molecules in live cells. Carefully measured in
vitro ADCC activity and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements will also complement our
MINFLUX observations and broaden the interpretation of our results. These studies are significant because they
will establish a molecular basis for antibody effector function, especially in relation to NK cell ADCC, that could
improve therapeutics for HIV. The techniques established in this proposal will also be useful for interrogating
antibody ADCC function for other viral pathogens. The expected outcome of our studies is the characterization
of biophysical principles that alter NK cell ADCC activity as well as the molecular mechanics that form the basis
for such activity. These findings will have an important impact on human health by offering a rational basis for
designing improved antibody therapeutics for HIV, as well as other viruses and diseases, and will increase our
basic understanding of NK cell ADCC."

The mission of the Genomics Core of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center SPORE in Leukemia is to
lead the analysis and interpretation of studies investigating the genetic, transcriptional, and epigenetic
mechanisms contributing to AML development and resistance to therapy, and to identify potential therapeutic
synergies and vulnerabilities through the integration of both targeted and unbiased genomic data. Achieving the
transformative advances required for each Research Project to meet its goals will be greatly reliant on access to
cutting-edge bioinformatics expertise. This expertise will be utilized to simultaneously focus a wide range of
genome-wide data types on specific biological questions from each Project while also being broad enough to
capture potentially shared mechanisms of response and resistance between the four Research Projects. Prior
to the initiation of all studies, Core staff will consult with SPORE investigators to discuss the underlying scientific
premise and translational goals of the project, to help the investigators select the ideal genomic techniques,
sequencing parameters, and robust analytical methods. We will also coordinate with the investigators of the
Biostatistics core to estimate sample sizes to ensure adequate power to address study objectives. In laboratory
experiments, Core members will assist in the formulation of the experimental design and in the analysis and
interpretation of the data at the conclusion of the study. For molecular studies using primary human and mouse
tissues, Core members will closely interface with the members of the Biospecimen Repository Core, and will
have primary responsibility for merging molecular and clinical data, and for performing appropriate bioinformatics
analyses. The members of the Genomics Core will also work with SPORE investigators to format data for
publication and assist with deposition of genomic data into public repositories to facilitate validation of results by
external investigators using their own analytical methods. We believe that this experienced and collaborative
Core is well configured to provide the Leukemia SPORE with a high level of bioinformatics leadership and support
that will enhance the quality and quantitative rigor of its science."
10702161,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The human brain is adept at constructing coherent perceptual experiences, despite an environment overflowing
with more information than can be processed at any given moment. Out of necessity, top-down cognitive
processes, such as attention and working memory, play a key role in regulating what we can and cannot
perceive. What neural computations drive this regulation of perception? While computational models have been
proposed to account for the effects of attention and working memory on visual processing, there is a lack of
empirical evidence testing these models in humans. This project will bridge this gap by pairing computational
modeling with non-invasive neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
and electroencephalography (EEG), to study the brain mechanisms underlying attention, perception, and
working memory. By using these techniques to track the neural fate of visual information across human visual
cortex during selective attention tasks, we will reveal the specific mechanisms by which top-down processes
improve our ability to see. In the long-term, development of a computational model will better quantify the top-
down regulation of visual processing – information key to vision scientists and basic researchers investigating
impaired cognition in patient populations. The aims of this project align with the mission of the NINDS and the
BRAIN Initiative, building innovative multi-modal neuroimaging approaches to understand the brain mechanisms
that underlie attention, perception, and working memory, with potential for guiding the diagnoses and treatment
of related disorders."
10775832,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Plasmodium infections and the disease malaria remain global health emergencies. Plasmodium parasites
replicate within and cause the destruction of host red blood cells, which triggers inflammation and causes the
symptoms of malarial disease. Parasite-specific antibody responses that develop following infection are critical
for controlling parasite burden and limiting disease severity. CD4+ helper T cells are essential for coordinating
these protective antibody responses. However, sterilizing anti-Plasmodium immunity rarely develops, even
following repeated infection. We hypothesize immune failures are mechanistically linked to aberrant or inefficient
Plasmodium-specific effector CD4+ T cell development and function. One of the most critical challenges to
developing new immune-based therapies or vaccines against Plasmodium is understanding the mechanisms by
which Plasmodium-specific CD4+ T cells develop, function and regulate humoral immunity following infection.
 In the continuation of this project, we apply powerful new cellular and molecular genetic approaches that
enable direct, high-resolution analyses of Plasmodium-specific CD4+ T cells. These new approaches facilitate
our long-term goal to understand the mechanisms governing the development and function of Plasmodium-
specific CD4+ T cell responses. Our goal is addressed by two specific aims that have evolved to test: 1) how
parasite-derived molecules influence cell antigen presenting functions and priming of Plasmodium-specific CD4+
T populations; and 2) how host physiological perturbations and constraints on cellular metabolism regulate CD4+
T cell development and function. Our innovative conceptual and technical advances and mechanistic approaches
enable us to establish additional new paradigms for understanding and enhancing CD4+ T cell-dependent anti-
Plasmodium immunity. Understanding cellular and molecular events governing CD4 T+ T cell responses during
malaria will enable us to identify and develop new immune-based strategies to limit Plasmodium pathogenesis
and disease burden."

The overall goal of this study is to conduct secondary analyses of available randomized controlled trial (RCT)
intervention data to gain actionable knowledge about how to improve HIV care continuum (HIV-CC) outcomes
among people living with HIV who use drugs (PLWHUD). Specifically, we will use available data from four
different RCTs to their full potential by analyzing mediators and moderators of efficacy that were not tested during
the original outcome analysis of the respective trials. The RCTs tested different HIV-CC interventions for
PLWHUD: 1) ARCS, which tested a community and individual level stigma reduction intervention for people living
with HIV who inject drugs in Vietnam; 2) HOPE, which tested patient navigation and contingency management
among hospital patients in the U.S. living with HIV with co-occurring substance use disorder; 3) LINC, which
tested a strengths-based patient navigation intervention among hospital patients in Russia living with HIV with
co-occurring injection drug use; and 4) HPTN 074, a HIV Prevention Trials Network RCT that tested an
intervention involving systems navigation, psychosocial counseling, and ART initiation among people living with
HIV who inject drugs in Vietnam, Indonesia, and Ukraine. Specific aims include: 1) Determine how and for whom
HIV-CC interventions improve biological outcomes (viral suppression, CD4, mortality) among PLWHUD. For this
aim we will test concordant hypotheses across all four trials about theory-based mediators and substance use
mediators, as well as moderators, and conditional process models (that simultaneously test mediators and
moderators in a single model); 2) Examine which specific mediators primarily affect HIV-CC outcomes among
subgroups of PLWHUD using newer causal mediation analysis to strengthen causal inference; and 3) We will
review our evidence to date to disseminate how HIV behavioral interventionists can meet improved standards
for complete evaluations in RCTs (i.e., test mediators plus moderators). The research is led by experts in HIV
prevention and care among vulnerable populations, including people who use drugs, and experts in advanced
mediation and moderation analysis. The study activities and deliverables will also be informed by a Scientific
Advisory Committee comprised of the original Principal Investigators from each of the four trials, as well as an
original Co-Investigator from each of the trials. These individuals include some of the leading experts in HIV-CC
engagement for people who use drugs and will be instrumental to informing the analyses and interpretation of
results. The research builds on our previous NIH R01-funded research that demonstrated how mediation and
moderation analyses help to shed new light on efficacious and non-efficacious results found in HIV prevention
RCTs. Moving beyond our previous research, in the current study we will disseminate accessible tools to the
HIV field that should improve our evaluation of interventions, and that will accelerate the impact of each future
RCT. Last, by analyzing drug use-related variables we gain valuable insight into the role of drug use in the
efficacy of HIV-CC interventions for PLWHUD, a critical population to support in order to end the HIV epidemic."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Despite remarkable advances in prevention of vertical HIV-1 transmission, however, there is little data to guide
the optimal early treatment regimens in vulnerable neonates with high risk of MTCT. Current recommended
antiretroviral regimens for children are extrapolated from clinical trial in adults. Most recently, our studies show
that a short-term combined ART (cART) incorporating an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), initiated at
3 days post infection (dpi) but not one day beyond, can rapidly suppress viremia to undetectable levels in
neonates, and a prolonged 9-month-early intervention of this regimen results in sustained virologic remission in
4 of 5 infants for more than 2.5 years after treatment cessation. Surprisingly, our further preliminary data showed
that delaying treatment (e.g., newborn macaques inoculated with SIV/SHIV AD8 and cART initiated at 5dpi) or
treating older infants (e.g., 1.5-month old infant macaques exposed to SIV with cART initiated at 3dpi) drastically
altered the outcomes after interruption of the same 9-month-early intervention, as indicated by viral rebound in
4/5 and 3/3 animals, respectively. These findings suggest that outcome of pediatric sustained virologic remission
appears to be very sensitive to the age of infants (e.g., newborn versus infants) and the timing (e.g., proviral
reservoir seeding?) of intervention initiation, yet the exact mechanisms of viral remission remain elusive. New
antivirals are also emerging and a once-monthly analog of DTG called cabotegravir (CAB) shows even greater
potential for preventing HIV acquisition and replication in recent adult clinical trials, yet its efficacy and safety in
pediatric HIV therapy have not been examined. Given newborn neonates lack well-organized lymphoid tissues
(sanctuary sites for antiretrovirals penetration and viral reservoirs) while possessing more dynamic and
regenerative capacity than an adult, prophylactic intervention in infants may be unique in that it may have more
effective antiviral activity for ART-free HIV remission, resulting in more replenishment of key immune cells and
normal development of the immune system. In this proposal, we hypothesize that early prevention interventions,
based on appropriate initial timing, duration and INSTI combination, could effectively block viral genome
integration and completely eliminate early viral reservoirs, resulting in a sustained state of ART-free virologic
remission in infants exposed to or infected with HIV, and subsequently, normal immune development throughout
infancy. Utilizing the pediatric NHP model of HIV, our overarching objective is address: SA1, the impact of
proviral reservoirs on prophylactic intervention outcomes in infants while assessing the efficacy and safety of
cabotegravir in a preclinical trial; SA2, the optimum prevention intervention strategy for achieving pediatric HIV
remission, and; SA3, the pharmacokinetics and immunological alterations of ART in the unique infant primate
host. Overall, these studies will provide insight into the optimal prevention intervention that achieves a sustained
state of ART-free virologic remission for infants exposed to or infected with HIV at birth, which will have significant
translational significance towards the treatment of HIV infection of infants in general."

10702014,"Heart Failure (HF) affects more than 6 million Americans with annual direct medical
expenditures exceeding $30 billion. Within the VA system, HF is prevalent among 5% of US
veterans with a disproportional annual mortality rate of 14.5%. A chronic sterile inflammatory state,
marked by sustained mild elevations of circulating proinflammatory cytokines, is associated with
poor clinical outcomes in HF. Large randomized trials that target specific cytokines, such as TNFα
and IL-1β, yielded variable results, indicating a knowledge gap in the mechanism linking
inflammation and HF. Specifically, it remains unclear what the inflammatory signals are and how
the peripheral immune cells—the primary effectors of inflammation—respond to and propagate
those inflammatory signals in HF. These gaps have halted the development of effective therapies.
Here, we postulate a novel model to mechanistically link inflammation to HF progression, such
that plasma extracellular vesicles (EV) encapsulating mitochondrial damage-associated
molecular patterns (MitoDAMP) serves as mediators to propagate the proinflammatory signal. On
the other hand, in pre-clinical and small clinical studies, boosting NAD+ has been shown to be
anti-inflammatory. Further, NAD+ deficiency is reported in pathologic states associated with
elevated inflammation, such as aging and HF. Our central hypothesis is that circulating immune
cells amplifies the MitoDAMP mediated inflammatory signal, and boosting NAD+ may be inhibitory
to this process. First, we plan to test hypothesis that the immunogenic factors in HF plasma are
the MitoDAMPs encapsulated in EVs. Second, given our preliminary data implicating monocytes
as a potential source of EV in HF plasma, we will study the cellular mechanism of EV release in
monocytes. Lastly, we will study how boosting cellular NAD+ by a metabolic precursor,
nicotinamide riboside (NR), may inhibit the monocytes from releasing EVs in vivo and in vitro. The
proposed study aims to define a novel HF disease mechanism that may ultimately lead to the
identification of new therapeutic targets. Completion of the proposed project will further my career
by positioning me in a scientific niche that intersects clinical HF and immunometabolism, providing
me with new research skills, and laying a strong foundation for my independent research program."

contrast to the requirement of 1000s of beta-particle traversals. Furthermore, they are not susceptible to
chemoresistance, and are minimally susceptible to radioresistance. In the development of patient-specific
treatment planning for RPT, one primary objective is to ensure that the radiation dose to normal tissues and
organs approaches, but remains below, thresholds for toxicity. Assessment of alpha-particle dosimetry of organs
at potential toxicity risk can be performed via the MIRD schema, but it ideally must be applied at a spatial scale
that is pertinent to the specific cell populations which drive toxicity, and that is relevant to the ranges of the
emitted alpha particles. The MIRD schema states that the absorbed dose to a target region may be computed
as the product of the time-integrated activity in a source region (i.e., total number of radionuclide decays) and
the radionuclide S-value (absorbed dose to the target region per decay in the source region). Traditionally, the
MIRD defines source and target regions as whole organs (liver or kidney) or perhaps organ subregions (e.g.,
liver lobe or renal cortex). Given the ranges of alpha particles, however, source and target regions would ideally
be defined at a more microscale level. The main goal of Project 2 is thus to develop a comprehensive library of
microscale S-values which will support RPT in the following organs: bone marrow, kidneys, liver, lungs, salivary
glands, lacrimal glands, and small intestine. Aim 1 will develop geometric-based models of these tissues in both
the human and mouse; we have previously published such models for both bone marrow and kidneys. In Aim
2, we will develop a new generation of 3D tissue models for microscale S-value computation based upon an
extensive library of high-quality serial histology images of these same tissues. These models (both mouse and
human) will be constructed across multi-ROIs (quantifying intra-organ variability) and multiple individuals
(quantifying inter-patient variability). Prior studies have indicated that the laboratory mouse is not a robust pre-
clinical model for RPT induced marrow toxicity. Consequently, in Aim 3 studies will focus on microscale bone
marrow S-values in the higher-species model of the mini-pig. Also, a microscale model of the porcine kidney will
be developed to allow for inter-species extrapolation. Aim 4 studies will focus on validating our Aim 2 and 3
models with respect to tissue volume changes and potential loss of blood in the tissue capillaries. Understanding
these changes will allow more accurate modeling of their in-vivo state."
10931448,"Recent advances in the targeted delivery of radionuclides and the increased availability of -emitters appropriate
for clinical use have led to patient trials of multiple α-emitter radiopharmaceutical therapeutics (RPTs). One of
these, Xofigo (223RaCl2) was FDA-approved and is in routine clinical practice, with many others likely to follow.
One of the stated goals (pillars) of the NIH is a greater level of personalization in medicine. In the realm of
radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) this translates directly as a need for more accurate personalized dosimetry
in order to enable fractionation and administered activity tailored to each patient. However, current dosimetry
paradigms are poorly suited to RPT. This reality is reflected by the discrepancies between clinical (or
experimental) toxicity and expected toxicity calculated using standard organ-level (or voxel-level) dosimetry,
including most notably: (a) hematotoxicity in 223Ra therapy of bone metastases, (b) renal and salivary gland
toxicity in pre-clinical models and patients. The objective of this work is to create a dosimetric methodology more
suited to αRPT, namely the Macro to micro (M2) methodology, which requires sub-organ activity apportionment
factors for organs at risk. This will be accomplished via the following Aims: 1. In murine models, measure αRPT
activity concentration in selected whole organs and in relevant organ sub-regions; generate apportionment factor
histograms. The translation to human assumes that the link between macroscopic and microscopic
spatiotemporal relationship for a given agent measured in a pre-clinical model will apply to the human as the
distribution of the agent to the different microscopic compartments should remain the same. We will test and
quantify the validity of this assumption and refine the human apportionment factors by introducing a third species,
the mini-pig In Aim 2. We will assess apportionment factor transferability, by obtaining corresponding
apportionment factor histograms for a porcine model. In Aim 3. We will demonstrate that M2µ predicts toxicity in
the porcine model. 4. Apply the M2µ methodology to clinical trial data to quantify the potential benefit of
personalized M2µ dosimetry and/or derive dose–response relationships. Successful completion of the proposal
will reconcile experimental and clinical results not currently understood and provide a robust standardized
dosimetry for personalized dosimetry-based treatment planning of αRPT. Such standardization will enable the
dosimetry to be normalized to EQD2, thus enabling rational combinations with other RPTs or external beam
therapy as well as relevant absorbed dose reporting. Here we plan to expand this approach to encompass the
wide range of RPT/organ combinations that have either been shown to be or are potentially dose-limiting and
that require the Macro to micro (M2) methodology to properly correlate dosimetry with toxicity thresholds and
provide a deliverable that will allow end-users to convert macroscopically-measured activity to standardized
dosimetry at the organ and (clinically relevant) sub-organ-level for a wide range of RPTs and correspondingly
relevant organs."
10931454,"If absorbed dose is to be used in treatment-planning based α-particle emitter radiopharmaceutical therapy
(αRPT), the impact of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair status- the process most likely to affect response
- must be considered in order to reliably predict toxicity and efficacy. Projects 1 through 3 have focused on
estimating tissue absorbed doses for αRPT. In project 4, we take these absorbed dose estimates and examine
whether clinically implementable methods for evaluating DNA DSB repair (DSBR) status will improve the
absorbed dose vs response relationship for patients undergoing αRPT. Our overall hypothesis is that tissue
absorbed dose will better predict αRPT response when adjusted by quantitative measures of DNA DSB repair
pathway functionality. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a novel approach to assessing repair pathway
functionality and couple it with preclinical and clinical scenarios that will allow us to rigorously evaluate the impact
of accounting for DSBR functionality in relating absorbed dose to response. We will use prostate cancer (PCa)
as a model system for the proposed studies. Prostate cancer patients are already treated with 223RaCl2 (Xofigo),
an FDA approved, αRPT. There is also evidence that the efficacy of this treatment is impacted by somatic and/or
germline deficiencies in DNA DSB repair. Accordingly, the proposed studies, will test our hypothesis in a context
that is immediately clinically relevant.
Aim 1: Using PCa cell lines and their repair deficient isogenic variants, relate absorbed dose (D) to DNA DSB
damage and repair, in vitro, in the context of BRCA2-/- and ATM-/- -related DNA DSB repair deficiencies; since
response is impacted by cell-cell interactions, perform these studies in (a) monolayer and (b) spheroid culture.
Aim 2: Collect dose- vs DSBR data, in vivo, analogous to that collected in Aim 1. Perform these studies in (a)
mice bearing xenografts of the cell lines and their isogenic variants used in Aim 1 and (b) extend the normal
organ studies of (a) using porcine marrow and kidney tissues from the dose vs toxicity studies of Aim 3 in Project
3. (c) In PCa patients treated with 223Ra, use normal tissue and tumor D estimates, with estimates of DSBR
functionality to assess the impact of DSBR deficiencies on D vs tumor and normal tissue response. DSBR
deficiencies will be assessed using DNA DSB repair (DDR) pathway mutation status obtained from liquid
biopsies.
Aim 3: Develop a mathematical model that may be used to optimize the selection and dosing schedule of DSBR
inhibitors (DSBRi) and identify patients whose genomic/transcriptomic profile and dosimetry would make them
likely high or low responders to αRPT±DSBRi therapy.
By coupling αRPT dosimetry with the DSBR functionality, the work proposed in this project completes the
transition depicted in figure 1 of the overview while also providing and validating a novel technique that can be
applied to investigating the role of DSBR inhibitors in αRPT of cancer."
10931423,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT (PROJECT 3)
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematologic malignancy of bone marrow plasma cells. Even though MM is almost
universally fatal, modern therapy has markedly improved survival. Among the most promising new MM therapies
are CAR T cells targeting B cell maturation antigen (BCMA). Despite high response rates in patients with
advanced disease, however, almost all patients eventually relapse after current-generation anti-BCMA CAR T
cells. This proposal furthers a long-term goal to prevent late relapse in MM patients after initial response to CAR
T cell therapy. In most cases, BCMA expression is retained at relapse, suggesting loss of anti-BCMA immune
surveillance as the primary mode of treatment failure. We and others have found that features of the T cells used
for CAR T cell manufacturing predict clinical outcomes, that CAR T cells can occasionally proliferate at late
timepoints post-infusion to control progressive disease, and that features of the bone marrow microenvironment
predict relapse risk after anti-BCMA CAR T cells. This proposal undertakes new approaches to prevent late MM
relapse after CAR T cell therapy; the approache to the clinical and pre-clinical studies is rooted in these prior
observations. We will conduct a clinical trial to test the safety and feasibility of therapy with anti-BCMA CAR T
cells manufactured from marrow-infiltrating lymphocytes (MIL) rather than the peripheral blood lymphocytes
traditionally used in CAR T cell manufacturing. We hypothesize that the BM-homing capability of MILs will
enhance trafficking and persistence of CAR T cells in BM. We will also pre-clinically develop two new approaches
to modulate CAR T cell activity in vivo post infusion. (1) We will introduce a modified IL-2 receptor into CAR T
cells to enable selective post-infusion in vivo stimulation with a pharmacologically administered and orthogonally
modified IL-2 ligand (orthoIL2); we hypothesize that orthoIL2 can prevent late relapse by maintaining in vivo anti-
BCMA immune surveillance. (2) We will develop BCMA-encoding mRNA-containing lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-
LNPs) to present BCMA in the context of antigen-presenting cells outside the immunosuppressive MM
microenvironment; we hypothesize that BCMA-encoding mRNA-LNPs can prolong in vivo anti-BCMA immune
surveillance, providing an approach to post-infusion modulation of CAR T cell activity that could be rapidly and
cost-effectively translated in combination with established, FDA-approved anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapies.
Collectively, our proposed studies will generate clinical and pre-clinical data to support the development of early-
phase clinical trials promising new approaches to prevent relapse after CAR T cell therapy for MM, which is the
primary clinical problem facing the field. In addition, findings from our studies could be readily translated to other
cancer types, including solid tumors."

The Administrative and Clinical Translational Core of this renewal Program Project will provide: (1) scientific
and clinical operational oversight; (2) IND-enabling regulatory and clinical development expertise, and
biostatistical and budgetary structure to support effective operations for each P01 Project and Scientific Core;
and (3) promote project integration and synergy. This renewal proposal seeks to build upon our proven track
record in genetically engineered T cell therapy by enhancing the chimeric antigen receptor T cell platform to
specifically address systemic vulnerabilities that we have observed in our clinical trials to date. Our
overarching hypothesis is that novel gene editing approaches can remove the remaining obstacles in the path
of universally-available and universally-active CAR T cell therapy for hematologic malignancy. We have
brought together a cadre of exceptional investigators who have collaborated and published together for many
years. Each disease-focused project will be led by a recognized authority in the field. The three cores that
support this proposal have been critical to the success of our clinical CAR T cell program to date and their
expertise will underpin the success of this proposal. The centerpiece of each project is an innovative clinical
trial that seeks to test our major hypotheses.
We are leveraging the proven translational infrastructure, administrative staff and the centralized research
organizations at the Center for Cellular Immunotherapies at the Perelman School of Medicine to achieve our
objectives. Strong institutional commitment from the Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine,
the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy and the University of Pennsylvania have facilitated our
scientific and translational achievements. The essential services provided by Core A include administrative
support for all investigators in each project and core; fiscal management and oversight for all components of
the Program Project; clinical protocol development, IND submissions and maintenance, and clinical data
management; and organization and communication of all Program Project meetings and activities. The overall
goal of this Core is effective and efficient leadership of the P01. The roles of the Director, Co-investigators
and administrative staff are to facilitate communication and organizational structure while stimulating scientific
and technological interactions. In order to achieve this goal, the Core has established four objectives: (1) To
oversee the safety and monitoring activities for Penn and CHOP clinical sites; (2) To provide regulatory,
preclinical development, and statistical support for clinical trials, projects and cores and implement data
sharing plans.; (3) To coordinate the interactions among clinicians and scientists in projects and cores, internal
and external advisory boards, and NCI personnel regarding effective implementation of proposed objective;
(4) To provide budgetary services such as tracking expenses and providing investigator’s monthly reports."
10931429,"Core B Summary
Core B comprises two interrelated laboratories: the Clinical Cell and Vaccine Production Facility (CVPF), a GMP-
compliant cell manufacturing facility, and an associated Antibody Development Laboratory (ADL) that is devoted
to the discovery and design of novel CAR-T constructs for use by P01-proposed projects. The CVPF is a
Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT)-accredited facility and is the only GMP-compliant
cell manufacturing facility on the University of Pennsylvania campus providing the university community with
integrated scientific, technical, and regulatory expertise to support manufacturing of biologics for in-human Phase
I and II clinical trials. The ADL is new to this P01 renewal application and will support the three scientific projects
by developing novel chimeric antigen receptor binding domains to complement those that are currently available
to the projects. Core B has four specific aims. In Aim 1, the CVPF will support Project 1 by providing 3-day
manufacturing, validation, and cryopreservation of CRISPR-mediated knockout of CD5 in CD19-directed CAR-
T cells for use in a clinical trial for relapsed/refractory CLL and NHL patients. In Aim 2, the CVPF will support
Project 2 by manufacturing, validating, and cryopreserving CD45 base-edited CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells
and CD45-directed CAR-T cells for use in a clinical trial for AML patients. In Aim 3, the CVPF will support Project
3 by manufacturing, validating, and cryopreserving BCMA-directed CAR-T cells from marrow infiltrating
lymphocytes (MILs) for comparison with conventional peripheral blood-derived BCMA-directed CAR-T cells
produced in parallel for use in a clinical trial for multiple myeloma patients. In Aim 4, the ADL will use antibody
phage display technology to construct and screen libraries derived from llamas immunized with CD5, CD45, and
BCMA in order to isolate single-domain VHH antibody fragments optimized with respect to affinity and other
desired functional properties as needed for use in Projects 1, 2, and 3."

10931405,"PROJECT 2: PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite remarkable progress in treating advanced melanoma, the prognosis remains variable. Specifically,
nearly all metastatic melanoma patients develop resistance to targeted therapy with time, while approximately
half do not respond to immunotherapy. These challenges highlight an urgent need to develop novel therapeutic
interventions, improve current treatments, and develop biomarkers that predict response. Emerging evidence
suggests that epigenetic regulators KDM5B and SETDB1 as therapeutic targets and endogenous retroelements
(REs) as biomarkers of response to immunotherapies. Our long-term goal is to translate our findings of novel
mechanisms involved in melanoma progression to the clinic. The objectives of this project are to dissect the
cellular mechanisms by which KDM5B and SETDB1 loss induce anti-tumor immunity, develop biomarkers to
predict response to immune checkpoint inhibitors, and to evaluate the therapeutic potential of depleting KDM5B
in melanoma. Our central hypotheses are that KDM5B and SETDB1 targeting de-repress the expression
of retroelements to initiate robust anti-melanoma immune responses, and retroelements can be
harnessed to predict response to immunotherapy. The hypothesis is supported by previous studies as well
as our own preliminary data from patient-derived melanomas and preclinical melanoma models. The rationale
is that better understanding of how KDM5B and SETDB1 suppress melanoma growth and anti-tumor immune
responses will result in new and innovative approaches to treat melanoma. The hypotheses will be tested in
three Specific Aims: 1) Dissect the mechanisms of immune responses induced by KDM5B and SETDB1 loss;
2) Evaluate the therapeutic potential of depleting KDM5B in melanoma; 3) Evaluate REs suppressed by KDM5B
and SETDB1 as predictive biomarkers in human melanoma. The proposed research is conceptually, technically,
and clinically innovative, because it aims to examine the therapeutic potential of KDM5B depletion using “first
in class” KDM5B degraders, and to evaluate RE levels as novel predictive biomarker for response to
immunotherapy. The results from these studies could impact the treatment of patients with melanoma and
increase our understanding of the factors that regulate anti-tumor immune responses."
10931409,"PROJECT 3: PROJECT SUMMARY
Major changes have occurred in treatment of unresectable melanoma in the last decade in which immune-based
therapies have dramatically enhanced overall survival. Unfortunately, almost half the melanoma patients do not
respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) upfront, and others develop recurrent or resistant disease over
time. Immunotherapies that can stimulate immunity in ICI-resistant melanoma are still therefore urgently needed.
To this end, cytokines have potent immunostimulatory activities that make them attractive candidates for use in
combination with ICIs to overcome resistance. Interleukin 18 (IL-18) is particularly appealing, because the IL-18
receptor (IL-18R) is specifically upregulated in CD8 tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and is widely expressed on
natural killer (NK) cells. However, clinical trials of recombinant IL-18 were unsuccessful, likely due to upregulation
of the endogenous IL-18 receptor antagonist or IL-18 binding protein, IL-18BP, which inhibits the
immunostimulatory effects of IL-18. The Ring lab therefore created an engineered version of IL-18 that is
resistant to the IL-18BP but fully retains its ability to activate the IL-18R. A clinical grade “decoy resistant” IL-18
(DR18) has been developed and licensed to Simcha Therapeutics by Yale University (ST-067). ST-067 is
currently being investigated in a first-in-human clinical trial as monotherapy. In pre-clinical models, DR18
synergizes with anti-PD-1. Furthermore, in murine models, DR-18 is highly effective in treating ICI-resistant MHC
class I deficient tumors, consistent with the ability of IL-18 to also activate NK cells. We hypothesize that
combining DR-18 with immune checkpoint inhibitors can overcome ICI resistance in melanoma via
activation of NK cells, T effector cells and stem-like memory T cells. We propose to conduct a series of pre-
clinical studies (Aim 1) utilizing novel animal models developed in house with clinically relevant melanoma
mutations to determine the mechanism of response and resistance of the combination of DR-18 with clinically
approved ICIs (inhibitors of PD-1, CTLA-4 and LAG-3). We have engineered the murine models to enable
evaluation of antigen-specific T cell responses to determine how T effector and memory function is improved.
Seeing that class I MHC loss in tumor cells is a major cause of resistance to anti-PD-1 in humans, we will also
study effects of DR-18 alone and with ICIs in B2m knockout models (MHC-I deficient). In Aim 2 we will conduct
a phase I/II clinical trial of ST-067 with immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients whose disease has progressed
on a prior regimen containing anti-PD-1. Tumor and blood samples from patients enrolled in the trial will be
interrogated to determine cellular mechanisms of response/resistance in humans using cutting-edge spatial
transcriptomics methods developed at Yale, and results will be compared to the murine samples collected in Aim
1. If successful, these studies will support further development of ST-067 with ICIs in patient subsets carefully
defined by immune cell characteristics. This approach can be applied to patients with other types of anti-PD-1
resistant tumors as well, and these studies have the potential for far-reaching implications."

The Biospecimen Core (Core B) is the cornerstone of all Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer (YSPORE) activities. It
addresses the broad melanoma patient specimen needs of all the projects that are not met by current shared
facilities at Yale. In addition to collecting, storing and distributing a wide range of specimens and reagents, the
core performs quality assurance testing and a wide range of molecular analyses of specimens. More specifically,
the core: a) collects a large repertoire of specimens for translational and preclinical studies in melanoma,
including melanocytic lesions, melanoma tumors and cells, normal skin, serum, and circulating lymphocytes;
b) ensures high quality control, proper long-term storage, detailed annotation, and timely distribution of
specimens to YSPORE investigators; c) establishes and maintains a central database of essential pathological,
clinical, epidemiological, and follow-up information and basic research data generated by the YSPORE projects
that is integrated with the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core; d) provides special services such as the analysis
of specimens from clinical trials, mutations, chromatin modification, and collection of TIL (tumor infiltrating
lymphocytes); e) maintains and distributes validated reagents (antibodies, oligonucleotides for PCR, DNA, RNA,
plasmids, cell extracts) needed for molecular analyses of tumors by different YSPORE investigators;
f) establishes links with shared facilities at Yale and similar resources in other institutions, including other
SPOREs; g) distributes samples to collaborating investigators outside of Yale; and h) provides specimens for
larger NCI objectives, such as melanoma specimens, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and annotated clinical data
for The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The core interacts extensively with investigators in each project, the
Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core, the Clinical Trial Office, and Yale Cancer Center shared resource cores
such as Yale Pathology Tissue Services and Yale Center for Genome Analysis. The services of the Biospecimen
Resource Core enhance the efficient operation of the translational studies by YSPORE investigators in a cost-
effective manner, and expedite the application of discoveries from the bench to clinical practice, and clinical
results to basic research."

Core. Drs. Kluger and Ma will continue to serve as Co-Directors of this Core and will be assisted by statisticians
and bioinformaticians with unique expertise and extensive experience. The Specific Aims of the Biostatistics and
Bioinformatics Core are as follows. Aim 1: Provide strong biostatistical and bioinformatics support to all SPORE
projects and investigators. The Core will provide timely and comprehensive support to address analytic questions
arising from the SPORE projects. Our service will cover the whole spectrum of the studies, including study
design, data management and analysis, result interpretation, and preparation of manuscripts, abstracts, posters,
and applications. The Core will have regular research meetings with the SPORE investigators and maintain an
open-door policy for all analytic needs. Aim 2: Provide effective data management for all the SPORE projects.
The Core will offer data management services to all projects and investigators and ensure that all NIH data-
sharing regulations are properly followed. This includes deposit of properly curated data to repositories such as
GEO, SRA, dbGaP, and others. Aim 3: Develop innovative biostatistics and bioinformatics methods. Data with
more complex characteristics are and will continue being generated by the SPORE and other studies. The Core
will develop new analysis methods which will facilitate more effective utilization of data and foster melanoma
analytic research. Aim 4: Promote program-specific research opportunities involving biostatistics and
bioinformatics trainees and faculty. The Core will promote opportunities within existing Yale programs and
centers, including the Yale Graduate Program for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CBB), Yale Center
for Biomedical Data Science (CBDS), Yale Center for Analytic Sciences (YCAS), and others. During the past
and ongoing funding period, the Core has made significant contributions to research and training, which is partly
reflected in our strong publication record and successes in training postdoc associates and graduate students.
We will continue to do so in the proposed funding period. The Core will borrow strength while not overlap with
that of other SPOREs and Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center (YCC). The Core will also be a key partner in
the SPORE with representation on the Senior Leadership Team and participation in all key meetings."
10931421,"DEVELOPMENTAL RESEARCH PROGRAM: PROJECT SUMMARY
The primary goal of the Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer Developmental Research Program (DRP) is to provide
limited support (maximum of $50,000/year, typically for no more than two years) for a broad spectrum of
innovative skin cancer pilot projects (involving research, resources, and technology development applicable to
human skin cancer risk, prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment). These pilot projects must have
promising translational research potential, with anticipation that they can eventually develop into, or be
incorporated into, full projects with an unequivocal clinical translational component. Such projects could either
be developed into independent external funding at a scope and scale equivalent to a NIH R01 grant, or
alternatively augment or replace a Project in future cycles of the Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer. A total of at least
$150,000/year will be used for Developmental Research Projects ($50,000 in direct costs and at least
$100,000 and up to $250,000 in institutional matching funds guaranteed by the Yale Cancer Center and the
Department of Dermatology). These funds will make it possible to support up to six DRP projects annually,
ranging from $30,000 to $50,000 each. A second goal of this DRP is broaden the collective of Yale
investigators who are actively engaged in research related to human cutaneous oncology. During its third five-
year funding period, the YSPORE DRP has funded fifteen different projects (13 related to melanoma, one to
cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, one to basal cell carcinoma) involving fourteen investigators and fourteen
collaborators from ten different departments and sections at Yale, and with project leaders including two
outside institutions. Two of the projects involved multiple PIs and most encompassed multidisciplinary
activities. Collaborators were drawn from seven external institutions, including the New York University
Melanoma SPORE."

treatments. This is achieved through the close collaboration of multidisciplinary clinicians and scientists
devoted to studying brain tumors and combine expertise in genomics, cell signaling, developmental biology,
immunotherapy, neuroimaging, epidemiology, and molecular therapeutics. A major goal of the NE Program is
to more effectively move promising discoveries from the lab into clinical trials by strengthening relationships
with clinical trials consortia, government agencies, and industry. All activities of the NE Program reflect the
HDFCCC’s cross-cutting Themes of Impactful Discovery (Theme 1); Effective Translation (Theme 2); and
Implementation and Dissemination (Theme 3) (see Director’s Overview), and are bolstered by the resources
and collaborative environment provided by the HDFCCC. Specifically, NE member research focuses on (1)
improving the understanding of the underlying biology of brain tumors; predicting patient disease, response,
and survival in brain cancers; and (3) improving therapy for brain tumors."
10883771,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
The cell surface is a platform for physical and regulatory control over cell biology, positioning it to be a key
interface for diagnostic targeting and therapeutic intervention. While RNA is a central polymer in biology most
thought and experimental effort devoted to RNA biology has been confined to intracellular spaces and excluded
from participating in cell surface biology. On the cell surface, carbohydrate polymers (glycans) are of critical
importance due to biophysical and signaling activities. Interestingly, despite both polymers playing central roles
in biology, RNA and glycans have largely existed in entirely non-overlapping fields of study. However, my work
has provided evidence of a hybrid molecule, an RNA-glycan conjugate (glycoRNA); this new class of biomolecule
represents a direct link between RNA and glycobiology. Critically, glycoRNAs are localized to the external
surface of living cells and can engage with immunomodulatory Siglec receptors. Thus, glycoRNAs are positioned
on a surface of critical regulatory importance, with access to cell-cell interactions, pathogens, and signaling
receptors on the cell surface. However, we currently lack facile tools to study this new cell surface molecule, we
do not understand the molecular or atomic composition of glycoRNAs, and we have a poor understanding of
how many species biosynthesize glycoRNAs. This MIRA proposal is focused on developing and implementing
methods to uncover functional roles of RNA glycosylation and we will approach the complex biology of
glycoRNAs in a systematic fashion. Initially we will develop novel chemical approaches to label glycans in the
context of RNA. My proposed strategy of selective carboxylic acid labeling represents an innovative new
approach to detecting glycoRNA, without the need for synthetic metabolic reporters. These tools will be easily
implemented across cell types and species enabling others in the scientific community. We will apply these tools
and other molecular assays to expand our understanding of the composition of the cell surface in the context of
glycoRNA. Biochemical, biophysical, and imaging-based strategies will be used to define the molecular
neighborhoods of glycoRNAs as well as the chemical nature of the RNA-glycan linkage; all together providing a
more complete picture of the mammalian cell surface. Finally, we will develop the first evidence of glycoRNAs in
non-mammalian organisms. First focusing on two major strains of yeast (S. cerevisiae and S. pombe) with robust
culturing, functional, and genetic tools that will allow for rapid dissection of the biogenesis pathway for eventual
engineering purposes. Expanding to other organisms including prokaryotes (pathogenic and not) as well as other
multicellular eukaryotes like C. elegans will better define the scope of glycoRNA biosynthesis and more robustly
equip us to generate synthetic glycoRNAs. More broadly, we intend to advance the general model of how cells
interact with each other, pathogens, and exogenous molecules, as without cell surface glycoRNAs, they are
likely incomplete. This proposal develops innovative methods to establish new conceptual and physical layers
of regulation between a cell and its environment."
10920465,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers with limited therapeutic options. About
95% PDAC patients harbor oncogenic mutant KRAS (KRAS*) that promotes pancreatic carcinogenesis and is
required for PDAC maintenance. Given that KRAS* can be druggable now, therapy resistance occurs in several
pre-clinical models and clinical trials, suggesting that therapy combination is required to achieve durable disease
control. Targeting KRAS* results in enrichment of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) in pancreatic, colon
and lung cancer models, offering opportunities for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) macrophage (Mφ) therapy
and for Mφ-mediated cancer-specific delivery of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, transplanted Mφs were
prone to accumulate in liver, lung, and spleen despite that most of the remaining Mφs were localized in tumors,
rising safety concerns that might be addressed by conditional gene expression systems. The hypothesis is that
tumor-conditionally expressed cytokine armored CAR Mφs (ca-CAR-Ms) may synergize with KRAS* inhibitors
(KRASi) to effectively suppress primary tumor growth, metastasis, and tumor recurrence and to prolong survival
in PDAC spontaneous metastasis mouse models. A successful outcome of proposed study will generate the first
ca-CAR-M therapy for PDAC treatment, pave the way for clinical trials in KRAS* PDAC patients and provide
applicable methods to develop ca-CAR-Ms for other Mφ-enriched cancers. Aim 1. Optimize cell culture and
engineering platforms for adoptive macrophage therapy. Primary Mφs are non-proliferative in vitro, and
accumulation of donor Mφs in healthy organs is a latent safety risk. Aim 1a will enable in vitro expansion of Mφs
by genetic or chemical screening of Mφ self-renewal regulators. Aim 1b will limit off-tumor activity of donor Mφs
by employing dual oxygen-sensing switch and identifying TAM-specific genes versus tissue-resident Mφs, whose
promoter/enhancers will be used for tumor-specific gene expression. Aim 2. Design CAR Mφs to target PDAC.
The comprehensive CAR optimization for effective antigen-specific activation of phagocytosis and cytotoxicity in
Mφs is lacking. Aim 2a will design and optimize constituent protein domains of CAR to direct Mφ activities against
PDAC. Aim 2b will determine the tumoricidal effect of CAR-Ms as an adjuvant therapy of KRASi in PDAC models.
Aim 2c will dissect mechanisms how CAR activation reprograms Mφ transcription, secretion, and pathway
transduction to elicit tumoricidal effect. Aim 3. Engineer conditionally armored Mφs to trigger tumoricidal
immunity. Mφs are tumor-homing, so delivery of pro-inflammatory cytokines by Mφs may reduce systemic
toxicity while elicit strong anti-tumor immune response. Aim 3a will develop safe and effective cytokine armored
Mφ therapy by cytokine screening and employing conditional transgene expression system. Aim 3b will assess
tumoricidal activity of Mφs engineered by the optimal CAR construct, the top cytokine candidate or both as an
adjuvant therapy of KRASi in various PDAC models. Aim 3c will delineate the role of cytokine armored Mφs in
the tumor microenvironment remodeling by single cell RNA sequencing and immunophenotyping."
10878948,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The olfactory system is critical to several aspects of behavior and survival in mammals, including humans. The
olfactory bulb is the first processing station of the olfactory system and constitutes an exceptional model system
for the study of neural coding, capable of encoding a highly complex sensory space within a compact and well-
organized structure. Understanding local circuit computation within the olfactory bulb will thus provide key insight
into fundamental principles of brain function. Broad perturbation of synaptic inhibition within the olfactory bulb
significantly disrupts projection mitral/tufted cell synchronization and olfactory-guided behavior, underscoring a
central role of inhibitory interneurons in local circuit computation. In contrast to other regions of the brain such
as neocortex and hippocampus, however, fundamental understanding of how the diverse inhibitory interneurons
within the olfactory bulb specifically support neural coding has remained elusive, with detailed knowledge of how
unitary synaptic interactions contribute to the precise regulation of mitral/tufted cell spike timing in particular
lacking. To advance understanding of local circuit computation and neural coding in the olfactory bulb, this project
will therefore directly examine unitary synaptic interactions between mitral/tufted cells and a highly-conserved
but understudied class of fast-spiking interneurons, using whole-cell pair recordings in acute mouse brain slices
together with pharmacology, morphological reconstruction, immunostaining, and simulations. Investigation will
specifically address three aims: 1) determine how fast-spiking interneurons regulate mitral/tufted cell spike
timing, 2) determine how dendritic computation supports fast-spiking interneuron function, and 3) determine how
fast-spiking interneuron signaling adapts with neural activity."
10889099,"Global climate change is projected to increase the spread of fungal infectious diseases due to persistent
stressful environmental conditions, such as record-breaking hot temperatures and droughts. Because
pathogenic fungi are good at tolerating stress, they may thrive under environmental stressful conditions
compared to other non-pathogenic fungi. The objective of this proposal is to investigate the relationship
between fungal pathogenicity and climate change. Specifically, if stress-tolerance brought by global climate
change triggers pathogenicity in soil fungi. The central hypothesis is that exposure to chronic environmental
stressors, such as heat and drought, favors the proliferation of pathogenic fungi in soil fungal communities and
enhances their stress-tolerance and pathogenicity. The rationale of this hypothesis is that upon completion of
this project, we will have identified mechanisms to better understand the relationship between climate change
and pathogenicity. Consequently, this will allow us to better plan for potential outbreaks of fungal infectious
diseases under global climate change, develop contingency plans, and potential treatments. The central
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Assess if stressful chronic conditions from climate
change, such as heat and drought, favor pathogenic fungi over non-pathogenic fungi in soils; 2) Determine if
heat and drought trigger saprotroph-to-pathogen transformations in fungi; 3) Evaluate if exposure to chronic
heat and drought cause persistent physiological changes in fungi including increased stress-tolerance and
pathogenicity. We will pursue these aims using an innovative and multi-scale approach which lies at the
intersection of microbiology, climate change, and public health. It includes the use of traditional microbiological
techniques coupled with recently developed high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic tools. These will be
applied at the species and community level to assess short- and long-term responses. The proposed research
is significant because investigating how fungi are responding and adjusting to global climate change is vital for
understanding and predicting future fungal disease outbreaks. The expected outcome of this work is to obtain
comprehensive knowledge of the changes the soil fungal community undergoes when exposed to chronic heat
and drought. In addition, to better understand fungal resource investment under stressful environmental
conditions, including physiological responses underlying pathogenicity in wild fungal communities at multiple
scale. The results of this project will have a positive impact immediately because it will provide knowledge into
pathogenicity mechanisms that fungi undergo when exposed to stressful conditions. Therefore, my work will: 1)
provide foundational knowledge to model and predict future fungal disease outbreaks and 2) inform policy
makers on the public health threat potential that climate change has on soil fungal communities. Altogether,
fulfilling a long term-goal of my research program which is to help better plan to ensure the health of our
society under a changing climate."

10931383,"OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM) and recurrent GBM (rGBM) is arguably one of the most fatal of cancers: it remains
impervious to treatment with the current standard of care (SOC) therapies and numerous clinical trials (including
immunotherapy) have failed to meet end points for FDA approval. This makes GBM/rGBM an unmet medical
need. The unresolved problem we are trying to solve is that the rGBM tumor microenvironment (TME) is
highly immunosuppressive. To revert this immunosuppression, we and others have been utilizing direct intra-
tumoral administration of oncolytic viruses (OVs), based on herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1). During the
current funding cycle (2018-2023), the Principal Investigators of this P01 have contributed several discoveries
both in preclinical models of GBM and in a 50 subject phase 1 clinical trial of recurrent GBM (rGBM). Major
findings relate to how human subject rGBMs change in response to oHSV (Project 2/ Chiocca), how Notch
signaling of myeloid cells in the GBM TME impedes oHSV function (Project 3/Kaur) and how to further immune-
stimulate oHSVs by “arming” with immune-stimulatory genes (Project 1/Glorioso and Project 4/Caligiuri).
Lessons learned informs the overall hypothesis for this P01: oHSVs induce a rapid and persistently inflamed
rGBM microenvironment, correlating with efficacy in human subjects and informing further therapeutic
exploitation by arming oHSVs with additional immunostimulatory genes. To test this overall hypothesis,
the four Projects will address the following overall aims: Overall Aim 1 – Validate the findings that improved
survival for human subjects treated with oHSV correlates with rGBM and peripheral blood biologic
transcriptomic and proteomic signatures (Projects 2, 3 and 4); and Overall Aim 2- Engineer and
preclinically test the “next-generation” oHSVs “armed” with selected immune-activating genes, focusing
on clinical translation for a new phase 1 trial (Projects 1, 3, and 4) To support the efforts of these 4
Projects, we will continue to utilize the services of the oHSV Production Core (Core 1/ Goins), of the GBM
Biorepository Core (Core 2/Ligon) and of the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core (Core 3/Mo & Zhang). The
proposed timeline for the successful completion of the overall aims is 5 years. The principal investigators of this
P01 espouse the principle of “from the lab to the clinic and back to the lab”, where the lessons from our treated
patients can be applied to build more efficacious therapies for this fatal cancer. The potential impact of this
research is that we are proposing to not only test preclinically and clinically potentially impactful oncolytic
immunotherapies for an incurable cancer, but we have shown commitment to analyze the biologic and
immunologic effects in treated human subjects, so that we can iteratively learn possible pitfalls and devise
solutions for patients with GBM."

Understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive prostate cancer progression has profound significance for
defining the biology of lethal prostate cancer. The cancer stem cell model proposes that cells within a tumor are
organized in a hierarchical lineage relationship and display different tumorigenic potential. This model has
important translational implications since it suggests that effective therapeutics should target cancer stem cells
that sustain tumor malignancy. However, despite intensive investigation, long-standing questions about the
existence and properties of prostate cancer stem cells remain unresolved. To identify, characterize, and
therapeutically target this population, we will combine the expertise of cancer stem cell researchers with
computational/mathematical approaches. Leveraging techniques from theoretical physics (Random Matrix
Theory) and algebraic topology (Topological Data Analysis), we will provide a statistical framework to dissect a
molecular signature (termed CasPro) implicated in progenitor activity in prostate tumors. We will experimentally
validate our findings by investigating CasPro-high cells in genetically-engineered mouse models of prostate
cancer and analyzing their functional properties in assays of stem cell activities. These findings will then be
further validated in studies of human prostate tumor samples, particularly from patients with treatment-resistant
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In the longer-term, we anticipate that our studies of key regulators
of the stem cell signature as well as the epigenomic landscape of CasPro-high cells will identify novel targets for
therapy, and lead to novel candidate drugs for these targets. Further development of candidate drugs might
result in inhibition of cancer stem cell activity, thereby providing potential treatments for CRPC."

The mission of the Biospecimen/Pathology Core will be to assist investigators with the development of preclinical
models that accurately reflect the genomic landscape of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and their use in
preclinical efficacy studies. The Core will play a central role in annotating, distributing, and tracking biospecimens
from AML patients enrolled in biospecimen banking and therapeutic research protocols. Detailed biospecimen
annotation, including documentation of pre-analytic processing variables, pathology findings, and patient clinical
history will be recorded in robust relational databases. The Core will be composed of two highly integrated units:
The Tissue Collection and PDX Modeling Unit will be responsible for providing access to human tissues and
PDX models. The Mouse Hospital Unit will provide an integrated infrastructure to support pre- and co-clinical
trials exploring efficacy of single agent and/or combinatorial treatments in relevant models using standardized
protocols that mimic those used in patients. The MSK Mouse Hospital houses the only academic GLP-compliant
facility in the region, providing investigators with the unique opportunity to perform GLP-compliant, IND-enabling
safety toxicology studies for novel compounds and biologics in-house. The specific aims of the core are:
Aim 1. To maintain and expand a model AML resource designed to annotate and distribute biospecimens
for translational AML research.
Aim 2: To assist in the generation of AML PDX models and access to human tissues banked at MSK
along with their clinical and genomic annotation.
Aim 3: To design and execute toxicity and therapeutic studies exploring tolerability and efficacy of single
agent and combination therapies against xenograft, primary transplant, and genetically engineered
mouse leukemia models (GEMMs).
Each of the research projects relies extensively on the Biospecimen/Pathology Core to achieve their translational
research objectives. For RP 1, the core will help with delineating molecular predictors of sensitivity and resistance
to IDH inhibitors, and testing novel combination therapeutic approaches to increase therapeutic efficacy in
IDH1/2-mutant AML. For RP 2, the core will provide materials for complex karyotype (CK) AML genetic studies,
aid in the generation of models that accurately recapitulate CK AML-specific features, and use these models to
test the tolerability and efficacy of novel OGDH inhibitors. For RP 3, the core will help with co-clinical trials of
PRMT5 inhibitors in PDX models and help perform preclinical in vivo studies of PRMT and other splicing
inhibitors. For RP 4, the Core will support the group in establishing PDX models of AML to test the efficacy of
autologous CD371-targeted IL18-secreting CAR T cells."

The role of the Biostatistics Core is to support the investigators of the Leukemia SPORE in their research
efforts, including laboratory experiments, molecular studies, and analysis of clinical trial and correlative data.
Prior to the initiation of all studies, Core staff will consult with SPORE investigators to discuss the underlying
scientific premise and translational goals of the project, to help the investigators select the most efficient and
robust analytical methods, and to estimate sample sizes to ensure adequate power to address study
objectives. In laboratory experiments, Core members will assist in the formulation of the experimental design
and in the analysis and interpretation of the data at the conclusion of the study. For molecular studies using
human tissues, Core members will closely interface with the members of the Genomics Core and will have
primary responsibility for merging molecular and clinical data, and for performing appropriate statistical and
bioinformatics analyses. The members of the Biostatistics Core will also work with SPORE investigators to
format data for publication and assist with deposition of genomic data into public repositories to facilitate
validation of results by external investigators using their own analytical methods. For clinical studies, they will
work with SPORE investigators to help set up effective systems to collect and track all required data. As the
research project (RP) studies proceed, Core staff will review project databases and monitor the quantity and
quality of data collected, and they will suggest modifications to the design and analysis plans as appropriate.
When studies are finished, the Core will conduct correct and efficient data analyses. They will also assist
investigators with the preparation of any necessary graphs and tables, the interpretation of results, the
preparation of presentations and manuscripts, and will consult on the design of subsequent research. If current
statistical methodology does not adequately address a research question, alternative methodologies will be
developed. We believe that this experienced and collaborative Core is well configured to provide the SPORE
with a high level of statistical leadership and support that will enhance the efficiency, quality, and quantitative
rigor of its science."
10862893,"ABSTRACT
Complex karyotype acute myeloid leukemia (CK AML) is defined by the presence of 3 or more detectable
cytogenetic abnormalities and has one of the least favorable prognoses of any leukemia genotype. Genomic
characterization indicates that this disease lacks conventional druggable oncoproteins, but instead is
characterized by a set of recurrent segmental deletions and mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene, the
latter of which are absent from normal karyotype AML and confer resistance to standard chemotherapies. To
better characterize the pathogenesis of CK AML and to develop new strategies to treat this disease, we will
exhaustively analyze the genomes of a large cohort of CK AML samples using a new low-cost, high-resolution
platform optimized in our group called “digital karyotyping”. These molecular features will be correlated with
patient outcomes data, and used to generate murine and human models that accurately recapitulate CK AML-
specific features. We will use these models to test a new therapeutic strategy for countering the pro-tumorigenic
effects of p53 loss. This concept builds on preliminary data showing that p53 loss can perturb cellular metabolism
in a manner that alters gene expression and drives aberrant self-renewal, and that reversing these effects with
small molecule inhibitors can drive differentiation of p53-deficient AML. Specifically, we have found that p53
mutations reduce levels of the metabolite aKG, producing similar effects of oncogenic IDH1/2 mutant proteins
that have proven to be drug targets in other sub-types of AML. In models studied to date, the tumor suppressive
effects of p53 are recapitulated by inhibiting the TCA enzyme 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) and, as
such, we consider OGDH a prime candidate for validation and development in CK AML. Successful completion
of the proposed research will produce a detailed understanding of the genetic changes that accompany CK AML
and allow for more faithful modeling of human disease. In addition, we hypothesize that oxoglutarate
dehydrogenase (OGDH) a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of CK AML. Validating our novel drug
target will pave the way for clinical trials in this indication. Given the paucity of effective therapeutic options for
patients with CK AML, the proposed studies address an urgent, unmet clinical need."
10862894,"ABSTRACT
Leukemias often display genetic alterations that result in dysregulation of the epigenome. To identify potential
epigenetic vulnerabilities, we recently performed a paired in vitro and in vivo shRNA screen in a number of
acute leukemia cell lines. The results showed that myeloid as well as lymphoid leukemia cells are preferentially
dependent on protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMTs), a family of enzymes that dimethylate arginine
residues of many proteins. A number of prior studies have identified PRMT5 as a promising therapeutic target
in cancer, which has led to an ongoing phase I clinical trial of a PRMT5 inhibitor for patients with refractory
solid tumors and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, which substrates of PRMTs are most critical for anti-
cancer effects of PRMT inhibition remains unknown and biomarkers predicting response to PRMT inhibition
are greatly needed.
Toward understanding the anticancer effects of PRMT inhibitors, we have also found that blocking PRMT
function perturbs RNA splicing, and that inhibiting either symmetric (mediated by PRMT5) or asymmetric
dimethyl arginine methylation (by Type I PRMTs) results in strong preferential killing of spliceosomal mutant
leukemias over their wild-type (WT) counterparts. Moreover, we have observed synergistic effects of
combining both type I with type II PRMT inhibition and/or inhibition of core spliceosome function. We therefore
hypothesize that the main cytotoxic effect of PRMT inhibition results from modulation of splicing.
We will examine our hypothesis by characterizing the effects of inhibiting type I PRMT or type II PRMTs on
pre-mRNA splicing, gene expression, and the methyl-arginine proteome in WT or spliceosomal-mutant
leukemia cells (Aim 1). We will also evalute whether combining inhibitors of type I PRMTs, type II PRMTs, and
the splicing factor SF3b enhances toxicity to myeloid and lymphoid leukemia cells, and the relationship
between these inhibitors' efficacy and mutations in various splicing factor genes (Aim 2). Finally, we will identiy
biomarkers of efficacy of PRMT5 inhibition using samples from a phase I/II trial of GSK's small molecule
PRMT5 antagonist (Aim 3) for the treatment of patients with refractory AML, CMML, and MDS.
This project stands to greatly improve understanding of the molecular basis for the efficacy of PRMT inhibitors
in cancer and to advance these drugs toward clinical trials in leukemia."
10862895,"ABSTRACT
There is an urgent and critical need for the development of leukemia stem cell (LSC)-directed therapeutic
approaches for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). One such strategy is targeting antigens that
are specific to LSCs but absent from normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). CD371 (CLEC12A, CLL-1),
which is present on mature myeloid cells, has been described as one such targetable disease marker given its
presence on both bulk AML cells and LSCs. Although not ubiquitously expressed on all AML cells, it is
expressed in up to 95% of AML patients, is enriched on LSCs and chemoresistant AML subpopulations, and
most importantly, is absent on HSCs.
We have successfully developed and validated a fully-human CD371-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)
T cell product which also secretes IL-18. Given that our CD371-targeting motif is entirely human, it is expected
to have reduced immunogenicity and thus minimizes host-mediated CAR T cell-directed immune elimination in
the context of constitutive IL18 secretion. In addition, IL18 secretion is predicted to enhance CAR T cell
persistence and modulation the tumor microenvironment (TME) by increasing and activating immune cell
infiltrates, leading to the induction of an endogenous T cell mediated anti-tumor immune-response capable of
eradicating antigen-negative tumor cell subpopulations.
Our central hypothesis is that CD371-targeted IL18-secreting CAR T cells will lead to eradication of antigen-
positive chemoresistant and LSC subpopulations, and the induction of an endogenous AML-reactive T cell
response that will lead to elimination of antigen-negative disease, without long-term HSC toxicity. This will be

phase I clinical trial with CD371-targeted IL18-secreting CAR T cells in patients with relapsed/refractory AML

The goal of the Developmental Research Program (DRP) of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
Leukemia SPORE is to provide seed funding for pilot projects that show potential to make meaningful
advances in leukemia prevention, diagnosis, and/or treatment. Supplemented by institutional funds, the DRP
will provide one to two years of funding to talented investigators or research teams from clinical and/or basic
science backgrounds from the MSK community, neighboring institutions, or in support of collaborations with
other Leukemia SPOREs. We will invite candidates annually to submit research proposals for peer-review by
a committee of experts in leukemia and translational cancer research. We will prioritize research proposals that
describe high-risk/high-reward hypothesis-driven work that has the potential to advance new avenues of
leukemia investigation, or proposals that bring together exciting collaborative teams who will address ongoing
problems in the leukemia field using new approaches and technologies. Applicants for DRP funding should
possess an MD and/or PhD degree and should hold independent-investigator status as a faculty member or
clinical researcher/research scientist at their institution. Applicants should have demonstrated a clear
commitment to translational cancer research related to leukemia. The DRP investigators will be considered full
members of the MSK SPORE in Leukemia and will participate ongoing meetings and research seminars
(regular meetings and seminars held by the Leukemia Working Group, Leukemia Disease Management Team,
Center of Hematologic Malignancies Science in Focus) as well as specialized SPORE meetings (annual, multi-
institutional SPORE Retreat; SPORE Seminar Series; monthly progress meetings). The DRP projects will be
monitored by the Executive Committee at monthly progress meetings, and will be reviewed to evaluate
potential to grow into a full SPORE research project in the current or upcoming grant cycle. The DRP
is committed to adhering to and supporting the MSK policies and procedures to promote diversity and
strengthen the participation of women and individuals from underrepresented minorities."

10897918,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The deployment of appropriate analytic techniques and careful data management are an essential component
for all Roswell Park Ovarian Cancer SPORE projects. The Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core (Core C) will
ensure that essential biostatistics and bioinformatics supports and resources are readily available to all SPORE
research projects. The goals of the Core are to improve the productivity of the Individual Research Project
investigators, reduce the barriers for access to analytic expertise, maintain high standards for data collection and
management, design and perform rigorous analytical strategies, and foster a collaborative and supportive
research community.
The Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core will assist basic, translational and clinical researchers of the SPORE
with proper formulation, refinement and execution of study objectives by applying the appropriate biostatistics
and bioinformatics analyses, and providing the appropriate interpretation of their results, in terms of both
strengths and limitations. We will ensure a priori that Developmental Research Program and Career
Enhancement Program projects are feasible from a biostatistical and bioinformatics perspective. The
Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core will ensure that appropriate data are collected; the data are of the highest
quality and meet regulatory standards for privacy; and the data are those required to answer a study question,
necessary for administrative reporting, needed to establish protocol compliance, and/or will be included in a
manuscript. We will prepare Data Safety Monitoring Board reports and post clinical trial results to clinicaltrials.gov
in a timely and compliant manner and ensure compliance to NIH policy and assist with data sharing of SPORE
data via the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons infrastructure and similar NIH-designated data repositories.
The Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core will develop and implement new and novel statistical and bioinformatics
methodology and the related software as needed to address all study objectives. We will implement software
solution and best practice to boost robust and reproducible research. Our proposed Biostatistics and
Bioinformatics Core will capitalize on a number of existing, well-functioning, NCI-funded units housed within the
Roswell Park Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics."

The primary objective of the Immunogenomics Core is to perform comprehensive immunophenotyping,
functional analyses, and genetic and epigenetic monitoring in peripheral blood and the tumor microenvironment
and investigate tumor antigen-specific immune responses for the immunotherapeutic approaches being
developed and tested in Individual Research Projects 1-3 of the Roswell Park Ovarian Cancer SPORE. It will be
also responsible for immunologic and genomic assays for Career Enhancement Program (CEP) and
Developmental Research Program (DRP). In conjunction with the Biospecimen and Pathology Core, morphology
and localization of immune cells on pre- and post-immunotherapy tumor sections will be analyzed by highly
multiplexed Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC). Additionally, in conjunction with the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics
Core, neoantigens, transcriptome analysis, epigenetic changes and TCR sequencing will be determined for
Individual Research Project 1 and 3. The Core will routinely provide SPORE investigators high quality, state-of-
the-art CyTOF, IMC, Seahorse assays, cell culture, cell isolation, flow cytometry, ELISPOT, ELISA, multiplex
cytokine bead array, RNA-seq, whole exome sequencing, TCR-seq, and Methyl-Seq.
The specific aims of the Immunogenomics Core are to:
1) Design and optimize immunologic and genomic assays for Individual Research Projects, CEP and DRP, and
 provide state-of-the-art immunophenotyping, transcriptome analysis, TCR sequencing, epigenetic changes
 and functional analyses of immune cells in peripheral blood and tumor microenvironment of patients who
 receive advanced immunotherapies in the Ovarian Cancer SPORE.
2) Run whole exome sequencing for tumor and peripheral blood samples to identify mutations and HLA types
 and confirm T-cell reactivity against the predicted neoantigens for DC-peptide vaccine in Individual Research
 Project 3.
In addition to these established immunoassays, the Immunogenomics Core will be developing new
methodologies/markers and making them available to the SPORE investigators. It also has a significant
educational role, working with all SPORE investigators, including PIs, technicians and young investigators on
their assay development, proper use of instrumentation, and interpretation of their data."
10700582,"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US and is
common among Veterans. Dyspnea, a debilitating symptom of COPD, dramatically worsens health related
quality of life, is associated with a reduction in daily physical activity and greater health care utilization and
is more closely associated with survival than severity of airflow limitation. Thus, it is important to have
effective treatments that reduce dyspnea for Veterans with COPD. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a
common complication of COPD that is associated with severe dyspnea, more frequent acute
exacerbations of COPD, and increased mortality. There are multiple causes of PH associated with COPD
(COPD-PH), including decreased bioavailable levels of the vasodilator nitric oxide (NO).
Phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor (PDE-5i) therapy restores NO signaling and improves
cardiopulmonary hemodynamics and dyspnea among patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.
However, studies of PDE-5i medications in COPD-PH have shown conflicting results due to differing doses
or durations of therapy and differing definitions of PH. In a prior study (ClinicalTrials.gov.identifier:
NCT01862536), we investigated the effects of up to 12 months of oral PDE-5i therapy with tadalafil on 6
minute walk distance (6MWD), a measure of exercise capacity in Veterans with COPD-PH, in a multi-
center randomized placebo-controlled trial funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs. While tadalafil
did not change 6MWD at 6 and 12 months (the primary outcome), the treatment group experienced
changes in important secondary outcomes, with clinically meaningful improvement in patient-reported
dyspnea and COPD-related health related quality of life after 6 months of therapy. Additionally, over 6
months, dyspnea worsened in the placebo group, and patients receiving PDE-5i therapy suffered fewer
exacerbations. A limitation of this study was its small sample size. Given the importance of mitigating
dyspnea among patients with COPD, we will assess the effect of maximally tolerated therapy with tadalafil
specifically on dyspnea powered as a primary outcome. In 126 participants with COPD-PH (63 treatment
and 63 placebo) receiving usual clinical care for COPD, we propose to evaluate effects of tadalafil on
dyspnea among patients with COPD-PH in a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
Aim 1: As primary outcome, we will determine whether 6 months of daily oral tadalafil is more effective
than placebo in reducing severity of patient-reported dyspnea, assessed by the University of California-
San Diego Shortness of Breath Questionnaire (UCSD-SOBQ), in Veterans with COPD-PH. We
hypothesize that patients receiving tadalafil will report less dyspnea than those receiving placebo.
Aim 2: As a secondary outcome, we will determine the effectiveness of tadalafil therapy on physical
activity, assessed by objective daily step count, and functional capacity, assessed by 6MWD. We
hypothesize that patients on tadalafil therapy will have improved physical activity and functional capacity.
Aim 3: As a secondary outcome, we will also assess the effects of tadalafil therapy on time to clinically
important deterioration, a validated composite outcome defined as increase > 4U in the total health-related
quality of life (St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire, SGRQ), decreased FEV1 of > 100ml, or moderate-
severe acute exacerbations of COPD. We hypothesize that Veterans with COPD-PH receiving tadalafil
will be less likely to have clinically important deterioration.
Aim 4: In exploratory analyses, we will assess whether changes in noninvasive measures of PH (CT scan,
cardiac echo) are associated with changes in dyspnea. We hypothesize that patients receiving tadalafil
will have decreased PA/A ratio on CT scan, and decreased ePASP on echocardiography.
This study may provide evidence for a new therapy for dyspnea in COPD complicated by PH."
10879068,"ABSTRACT: Advances in cytoreductive surgery and combination chemotherapy have improved 5-year survival
in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, but the rate of cure remains essentially unchanged over the last two
decades. Computer models suggest that detection of ovarian cancer in early stage (I-II) could improve rates of
cure by 10-30%. In two major trials, a two-stage strategy where rising values of CA125 analyzed with a Bayesian
Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) prompted transvaginal sonography and abnormal imaging prompted
surgery proved sufficiently specific to exceed a positive predictive value (PPV) of 10%. With support of the EDRN,
7,869 apparently healthy women have participated in the Normal Risk Ovarian Cancer Screening Study
(NROSS) at 11 different sites in the United States with 46,008 CA125 determinations over the last 21 years.
Twenty-nine patients have been referred for operations detecting 17 ovarian cancers with 12 (71%) in early stage
I or II. In addition, 4 cases of early stage endometrial cancer were detected, yielding a PPV for detecting cancer
of 72%. No more than 2-3 operations will be required to detect each case of ovarian cancer. As CA125 is
expressed by only 80% of epithelial ovarian cancers, better sensitivity is likely to be achieved with multiple
biomarkers. During this grant cycle we have reported that HE4, HE4 antigen-autoantibody complexes, and
osteopontin significantly enhance the sensitivity of CA125 for detecting early stage (I-II) disease and have
developed a ROCA2 that includes all 4 biomarkers and detects advanced disease 1.4 to 4.8 years earlier than
ROCA. We have found elevated levels of anti-TP53 autoantibodies (AA) in 20-25% of patients with ovarian
cancer. Titers of anti-TP53 rise 12 months prior to CA125 and 22 months prior to diagnosis in patients where
CA125 does not increase. In an EDRN consortium with investigators from Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center,
Arizona State University and the Massachusetts General Hospital, we have compared 5 anti-TP53 autoantibody
assays and found the RAPID assay most sensitive. Some 28 different AA have been assayed in a standard
panel of 952 sera to identify three - TP53, CTAG1, and IL-8 – that can be detected in early stage disease and
complement CA125. Over the last two decades, we have collected and preserved 922 blood and 774 tissue
samples at the time of initial surgery in patients with ovarian cancers. During the last 6.5 years we have banked
18,754 new serum and plasma samples from the NROSS and provided serum/plasma samples for 11
investigators to test biomarkers for early stage ovarian cancer. We have published 23 peer reviewed articles,
reviews and commentaries. A team of 36 investigators and staff will pursue 3 Specific Aims: 1) to conduct the
NROSS2 trial to determine the specificity and PPV of a two-stage ovarian cancer screening strategy using a 4
biomarker ROCA2 and a panel of 3 autoantibodies; 2) to evaluate multiple biomarkers for early detection of
recurrence or persistence of disease at positive second look operations; and 3) to maintain and share a serum
and plasma bank to facilitate evaluation of novel biomarkers for early detection of ovarian cancer."

Hypertension (HTN) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) overburden African Americans (AAs). These disparities
translate to higher rates of cardiorenal disease endpoints including stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), end
stage renal disease (ESRD), and death. Blood pressure (BP) lowering with antihypertensive treatment reduces
the risk of these outcomes, but the effects of treatment may be variable in different race groups. Studies have
demonstrated that AAs respond best to calcium channel blockers and diuretics and not as well to to beta-
blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers in comparison to their
European American (EA) counterparts. The reasons for differences in cardiorenal health and antihypertensive
treatment response are multifactorial and thought to include both environmental and inherited factors. Prior
genetic and pharmacogenetic association studies of HTN and BP response to antihypertensive agents have
been undertaken in AAs, but these studies have been considerably smaller in scope and sample size compared
to those of EA populations. Smaller samples sizes of existing genetic datasets have hindered polygenic risk
prediction in this population with the potential to create new health disparities. In order to overcome the limitations
of previous research and enable efforts in personalized medicine in AAs, we will leverage data from existing
cohorts for one of the largest genomic and pharmacogenomic studies of cardiorenal traits to date. Our
pharmacogenetic discovery includes >4000 AAs randomized to chlorthalidone and >2500 randomized to
lisinopril from the GenHAT study, an ancillary study of the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to
Prevent Heart Attack Trial. We have established an agreement with the International Consortium for
Antihypertensives Pharmacogenomics Studies (ICAPS) for validation of our findings. Our genomic discovery is
anchored in whole-genome imputed GWAS data from ~12000 REGARDS study AA participants and ~5000 AAs
(JHS, Genoa, HyperGEN) with relevant phenotype and genotype data from the NHLBI’s Trans-Omics for
Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program. We will replicate our top variant-association findings in additional
populations (~11,000 AAs) with relevant data followed by polygenic risk score testing in other cohorts from
TOPMed. Using these rich resources we will derive new screening tools for antihypertensive treatment response
and cardiorenal diseases. Polygenic risk score applications are increasing in other populations and this research
will substantially improve the available data in underrepresented AAs. ."
10884301,"7. Project Summary
 Heart failure (HF) is a major public health concern with an estimated 6.2 million Americans suffering
from HF and greater than 1 million new cases per year. Patients with HF have significantly reduced quality of
life and are at high risk for hospitalization and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. There is a growing
recognition of the clinical utility of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) for assessing patients with HF.
While there is growing utilization of CMR for evaluation of HF, there remain a number of barriers to widespread
acceptance and utilization of CMR for this application. Current clinical studies take 40 min to an hour and
require the patient to complete about 40 separate breath-holds of 10-15 second duration. There is strong
potential to improve the clinical utility of CMR in HF by creating simplified and robust free-breathing, non-ECG
gated techniques, which are straightforward to perform. This would also improve the patient experience by
shortening the study and eliminating the need for breath-holding, which is particularly difficult for HF patients.
 To address these limitations of current clinical techniques, we propose to develop and validate a
technique, Cine And T1 mapping SPiral Acquisition with Respiratory and Cardiac Self-gating (CAT-SPARCS),
which will simultaneously perform cine and T1 mapping in a <5 minute FB non-ECG gated acquisition.
Application of this technique pre and post contrast will enable a comprehensive assessment of cardiac function,
Native T1, LGE and ECV in under 15-minutes. The specific aims of this proposal are (1) to develop a 2D CAT-
SPARCS technique to simultaneously acquire cine, T1 maps and LGE images during a free-breathing cardiac
self-gated acquisition, (2) to extend the 2D CAT-SPARCS to provide whole heart simultaneous acquisition of
cine, T1 mapping and LGE images using simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) and 3D spiral acquisition techniques,
and (3) to validate the CAT-SPARCS technique against the clinical gold standard breath-held ECG-gated clinical
techniques in normal subjects and patients being evaluated for HF. Successful completion of this grant will result
in the development and validation of a highly efficient technique for simultaneous T1 mapping and cine imaging
which will demonstrate high accuracy and repeatability significantly shortening the CMR examination."

10928888,"1.0 Overall Abstract
We propose the establishment of PORTENT – “Point-of-Care Technologies for Nutrition, Infection and Cancer
for Global Health” centered at Cornell University in partnership with Columbia and McGill Universities.
The recent Lancet Diagnostic Commission report states that the “diagnostic gap is most severe at the level of primary
health care, in which only about 19% of populations in low-income and lower-middle-income countries have
access to the simplest of diagnostic tests … People who are poor, marginalized, young, or less educated have the
least access to diagnostics.” Developing PoC devices for these populations is challenging. The needs are unique,
the users have disparate qualifications, the path to commercialization is different, the settings have variable
infrastructure, the regulatory agencies have distinctive requirements, and the stakeholders are diverse. The
PORTENT Center is unique as it (1) focuses on primary health care globally; (2) addresses the needs of the
most vulnerable in the US and internationally; and (3) enables a broad range of diagnostic technologies to be
validated on a global scale while simultaneously developing expertise and building capacity internationally
to have the most impact even beyond the center. The center builds on our decades of international experience in
validation, deployment, and commercialization of POC systems and incorporates clinical validation and satellite
technology sites across four continents enabling testing on diverse populations and with a unique set of users.
Our approach is fundamentally enabled by 5 key differentiable elements: (1) A rigorous approach to Needs
Assessment through the establishment of an annual Global PoC Needs Assessment Consensus developed by a
Needs Assessment Advisory Board; (2) The ability to validate PoC technologies on an exceptionally broad range
of established populations and biospecimens in New York City, Ecuador, India, and Uganda; (3) The
establishment of a “Lab-to-Market accelerator for Global Health Point of Care Technologies” to provide
commercialization and tech-to-market support for PORTENT projects; (4) Unique training opportunities and
knowledge transfer workshops for healthcare workers in LMICs on the use of PoC devices and clinical rotations
at our international sites for PoC developers; (5) Access to the team’s network of industrial partners, diagnostics
companies, regulatory experts, venture capital groups, and domestic & international non-governmental
organizations. Illustrative of what we will fund through PORTENT, we describe four “Year 1” projects that (1) enable
early screening of cervical cancer, (2) determination of iron status enabling anemia screening, (3) combined HIV and
multiplexed detection of sexually transmitted diseases, and (4) broader, cheaper, and more accurate malaria testing.
By the end of year 5, PORTENT will: initiate 20 independent PoC technology projects (with 30% from outside
US), engage ~ 15 teams in the Global Health Lab-to-Market accelerator program, train 30 health care workers
from LMICs on use of PoC technologies, and provide >20 clinical rotations for technology developers."

 2.0 Administration Core
Abstract
The global nature of the PORTENT center requires a unique administrative core with deep experience in
international collaboration, research administration, clinical practice, needs assessment and training
and technology commercialization. With deeply established experience in biomedical technology
development, global health, international training, and center management Cornell University in partnership with
Columbia University and McGill University are uniquely positioned to establish and manage such an effort.
Through our prior capacity building efforts, we have established relationships with all the PORTENT clinical sites
– including IRBs - which will enable much more efficient and timely administration and execution of center
projects. The technical and clinical direction of the center will be guided by an External Advisory Board – who
will help set the overall direction of the center and support the final selection of new PoC projects – and a Needs
Assessment Advisory Board – that will establish an annual needs assessment consensus to support project
solicitation. Center expertise will also be supported by an extensive network of partner companies, governmental
and non-governmental organizations, and global health related academic programs.
Working in concert with the other cores, the primary focus of the Administration Core will be to (1) Effectively
employ the PORTENT’s clinical, technical, and other resources in support of the funded PoC projects, (2)
Administer annual Requests for Proposals to solicit new and evaluate current projects, and (3) Establish and
manage the advisory committees, (4) Ensure overall coordination between the three domestic partner sites and
four primary clinical sites, (5) Maintain the network of external partnerships and establish new ones, and (5)
Manage the day-to-day activities of the center including financial, human resources, administrative support and
conflict management."
10702037,"The purpose of this collaborative project is to identify robust biomarkers that predict chronic neuronal
dysfunction following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Evaluating TBI-induced pathology and dysfunction in the
brain can be challenging. We hypothesize that the retina can serve as a surrogate to monitor
the rate of neurodegeneration occurring in the brain following injury. Furthermore, we hypothesize that
blood-based biomarkers correlate with TBI-mediated neurodegeneration in the retina and brain. The
first phase of this project is the discovery phase with the objective of identifying biomarkers that are predictive
of chronic neuronal damage. Three distinct proposals will examine both blast-mediated and impact TBI
using overlapping assessments of retinal function and structure. Each proposal will also utilize unique
outcomes including proteomic analysis of the blood and serum, cognitive function, brain imaging modalities,
and histology in both animal models and Veterans. A fourth project will use data from the first three projects to
apply tissue modeling and informatic approaches to fully characterize TBI injury in the retina and brain. The
second phase will validate the candidate biomarkers identified by each site by testing animals/tissue, and
human biofluid samples in the other laboratories. This phase will determine the robustness of each biomarker
across studies. In the third phase, we will test the most promising biomarkers in mice exposed to live blast
explosions, providing translational value to the biomarkers.
 Project 4 (this project) will manage big data and analytics (statistics, computational modeling, and
machine learning/AI) for the Linked Merit. The rich TBI measures produced by Project 1-3 will create a specific
type data management challenge: big data variety1. We will manage this data variety across projects using
data science and advanced analytics to assess multiple injury severities and types in a unified pipeline. By
pooling and aligning diverse data at a granular level, it becomes possible to make TBI biomarker data
Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR)2, making complex data manageable, improving
biomarker discovery, enhancing quality control (QC) and reproducibility, and enabling advanced analytics
to drive translational therapeutic development. The present Linked Merit leverages our prior efforts to build
infrastructure enabling FAIR data sharing, data citation and query, and multidimensional analytics;
repurposing them to promote biomarker discovery, assess reproducibility, and cross-validate findings. We
will establish a TBI Open Data Commons pipeline for biomarkers (Aim 1). We will ingest and cross-curate
animal data from Project 1 [Harper], Project 2 [Feola], Project 3 [Wang] and Co-I Thao (Vicky) Nguyen will
use sensor data from these studies to develop biofidelic computational models of blunt TBI, shock-tube
blast, and open field blast experiments to determine and compare the stresses and deformation of the
tissues of the eye (retina, optic nerve head) and optic tract at the base of the rat/mouse brain (Aim 2). We will
then work closely with Project PIs and clinician-scientist Co-I Fanny Elahi to perform clinicopathological
analysis of retinal and biofluid biomarkers as reproducible and cross-species translational predictors of
functional outcomes in TBI (Aim 3), harnessing a combination of traditional statistics and machine learning/
machine intelligence tools. This approach will ensure rigor and reproducibility of validated retinal and blood-
based biomarker associations for diverse TBI types. Through this work the Linked merit will take tangible
steps toward realizing the potential of biomarkers to predict neurodegeneration and drive precision therapeutic
targeting."
10912561,"PROJECT SUMMARY: RESEARCH EDUCATION CORE
The goal of the Meharry Medical College/Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center/Tennessee State Cancer Partnership
(MVTCP) Research Education Program is to facilitate the growth and career development of a new population
of outstanding underrepresented minority (URM) cancer researchers. Our current Pathway to Discovery program
begins with cancer research education for high school students, continues for undergraduate Biology/Chemistry
majors at Tennessee State University (TSU) and culminates with support for graduate students (PhD, MSPH
and MPH) at Meharry Medical College (MMC) and TSU. The program also includes research support for medical
students at MMC and Vanderbilt University (VU). This program has proven to be very successful in supporting
the progression of a diverse population of students into cancer research careers. We propose to enhance the
efficacy of the Pathway to Discovery program by including psychosocial resources derived from social cognitive
career theory (SCCT). Research experience will engage students in the development and evolution of self-
efficacy (SE) as well as a sense of being part of the scientific research community [science identity (SI)]. SCCT
research shows that strong SE and SI are especially crucial to URM students entering and completing the
necessary programs to pursue research careers, including cancer research. We propose a program grounded
in SCCT that provides psychosocial resources and research experiences needed to develop and sustain SE and
SI. MVTCP is particularly suited to target African American and Latinx undergraduate students (at TSU),
graduate (at TSU and MMC) and medical students (at MMC). High school students come from two local STEM
magnet schools with predominant URM student populations. To achieve our goals, we propose the following
aims: 1) Provide psychosocial resources for high school (8 students, 4 juniors and 4 seniors) and undergraduate
students (12 students, 3 at each level freshmen through seniors) engaged in continuous academic year and
summer cancer research experiences to ensure development of SI and SE by leveraging the cancer research
and support resources at our Partnership institutions. Development of SE and SI will be accomplished by
providing opportunities for laboratory research and communities of practice (CoP) and a series of workshops
based in SCCT. 2) Recruit and support a diverse population of graduate students (2 MPH/3 PhD students each
year) who will evolve, strengthen and maintain a strong SI and SE as they engage in cancer research with the
ultimate goal of enhancing the diversity of the cancer research workforce. SCCT-based workshops and
resources targeted at the evolution and maintenance of SE and SI in our graduate students will be implemented.
3) Provide educational research opportunities, workshops and CoP to medical students (4 students each year
at MMC/4 at VU) to ensure successful evolution, strengthening and maintenance of their SI and SE and to
sustain their interest in clinical population sciences and translational cancer research with a focus on disparities."
10912564,"PROJECT SUMMARY: CANCER OUTREACH CORE
The Cancer Outreach Core (COC) will apply a community-engaged research (CEnR) framework to facilitate and
nurture integration and partnership between the institutions in our Meharry Medical College/Vanderbilt-Ingram
Cancer Center/Tennessee State University Cancer Partnership (MVTCP). The COC will engage with our
community partners to incorporate meaningful community engagement into research and outreach to ensure
that MVTCP activities are reflecting the needs and concerns of those populations that are most affected by
cancer health disparities in the 14-county Nashville Metropolitan Statistical Area. The overarching goal of the
COC is to facilitate the reduction of cancer health disparities by leveraging the strengths of community partners to
support and enhance cancer research and outreach efforts which will be addressed by the following Specific Aims:
1) enhance community collaborations to accelerate research and implementation of programs and policy
designed to reduce cancer burden and disparities; 2) facilitate strategic research and diverse/inclusive clinical
trial participation relevant to community needs; and 3) develop innovative outreach and education strategies to
support capacity building of MVTCP stakeholders. These aims will be achieved through the collaboration of the
COC with other MVTCP cores, through a robust Community Advisory Board (CAB), and through regularly
consulting with MVTCP research projects. Given the significant regional mortality disparity among Black (compared
to white) men with prostate cancer, a CAB member representing the Prostate Cancer Coalition of Tennessee
collaborated on the pilot work that led to the submission of a full project in this renewal on prostate cancer. The higher
regional rates of ovarian cancer led to the formation of an ovarian cancer support group established through a CAB
member, enabling ongoing support of a pilot project focused on ovarian cancer. During the last grant period, COC
helped to foster incorporation of dissemination and implementation science into the CEnR which contributed to the
full project in this renewal focused on breast cancer risk assessment. The COC will facilitate bi-directional
communications, bringing community input to the projects and disseminating results to the community. Furthermore,
MVTCP investigators leading research projects will provide presentations to the CAB and receive feedback on
presenting to lay audiences. With coordination through the Administrative Core, the COC will collaborate with
the Translational Pathology and Population Research and Clinical Trials in Cancer Equity Shared Resource
Cores to develop an educational module about biospecimen donation. With the Research Education Core
students will be engaged in community outreach utilizing new technologies aiming to reduce cancer disparities.

10934538,"Project Summary/Abstract
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer worldwide. The mortality rate represents over 25% of all cancers
deaths, four times the number of breast cancer deaths in the U.S. Despite substantial improvements in the
treatment of lung cancer, its prognosis remains dismal, with a current 5-year mortality of approximately 85%,
in large part because it is usually diagnosed at stage III or IV. This high lung cancer burden reflects how
ubiquitous are exposures to tobacco smoke and other behaviorally influenced factors. These exposures, along with
poor adoption of screening and cancer control approaches, impedes improvements in survival. Management of lung
cancer risk can be accomplished at all steps of the cancer prevention continuum, starting with primary prevention,
primarily by modifying smoking behavior. After the development of lung cancer, early detection dramatically reduces
mortality but compliance with existing guidelines for screening is poor. Furthermore, the majority of lung cancers that
will develop occur among the population that is ineligible for screening. Finally, even among those who are screened,
a large number of positive findings are detected and improved approaches to resolving high versus low-risk findings
are needed to reduce the burden of excess management and overdiagnosis. Our program project, entitled
‘Integrative Analysis of Lung Cancer Risk and Etiology (INTEGRAL)-Applications and Translation is broadening our
studies to identify predictive risk factors in minority populations and among never smokers. Our aims are the
following. Aim 1: To use genomic predictors to identify individuals who are at higher risk for lung cancer
development. This aim focuses on developing and applying methods for risk assessment in diverse populations,
Aim 2: To develop and implement novel biomarkers that identify individuals who are at elevated lung
cancer risk and will benefit from low dose spiral CT screening. This aim extends our prior research to
identify risks for nonsmokers and evaluate the translation of biomarker studies for population-based research.
Aim 3: To evaluate predictors of lung cancer detection and progression based on an integrative analysis
of data from screening populations. This aim evaluates new approaches to integrative analysis of biomarker
and radiographic marker studies in screening populations. Aim 4: To implement novel frameworks to manage
risk reduction at all stages of lung cancer development and management. This aim cuts across projects
and evaluates the barriers and interests of populations who will benefit from the research being conducted by
this P01. This proposal builds upon a highly successful prior program project to broaden the populations we are
studying and engage and translate the findings to diverse populations."
10934563,"Project Summary/Abstract
Lung cancer (LC) is a “poster child” for a disease resulting from interactions between genetic and environmental risk
factors. Ongoing LC genome wide association studies (GWAS) conducted by us have identified over 40 loci involved
in LC susceptibility that have dramatically improved the understanding of the genetic architecture of LC risk. However,
there is a significant bias in the conducted GWASs: most studies have involved populations of European descent.
Ancestry plays an important role in LC risk through contribution of ancestry- specific germline polymorphisms as well
as socio-cultural differences including environmental exposures. We hypothesize that a “one size (ancestry) fits
all” model is not applicable to LC and that exploring risk of LC and its translation across ancestries manner
will improve the understanding of LC risk and prevention in diverse human populations. Our specific aims
include the following. Aim 1. To precisely characterize the contribution of genetic variation to lung cancer
etiology. The genetic approach will include genotyping arrays and low pass whole genome sequencing (WGS) and
imputation into the large multi-ethnic reference panels to generate the world largest resource for the discovery of lung
cancer susceptibility variants influencing lung cancer risk across a range of ethnicities. Aim 2. To perform post-
GWAS analysis to identify environmental and host-specific factors influencing lung cancer development.
Mendelian randomization will enable the identification of causal molecular factors, such as biomarkers,
influencing lung cancer, which facilitates developing screening programs for lung cancer (Projects 2 and 3. In
addition, we will also use forward and reverse Mendelian randomization to partition the causal effects of
biomarkers on lung cancer risk according to cis-acting genetic components, trans-acting components related to
broader host-exposures and external factors. We will develop and use novel annotation methods to identify most
likely causal variants to improve polygenic risk score development. Aim 3. To develop population-specific as
well as multi-ancestry polygenic risk scores (PRSs) to refine risk estimation of LC for minority
populations. In this aim, we will first build and characterize PRSs from genomic analyses to identify subsets of
individuals at high risk for lung cancer development1. Second, to date, studies have focused on analysis in
European-descent populations. Aim 4. To evaluate the impact of returning genetic risk factors information
to motivate behavior change in diverse populations and to scrutinize direct translational implications of
the genomic findings from our ancestry-specific and cross-ancestry studies. In this translational aim, we
will engage both patients and healthcare providers by adopting a rapid cycle research approach to reduce the
time lag from discovery to practice while accommodating evolving genomic evidence base. This project provides
data to the other projects and plays a key role in developing translational applications to evaluate interest in
communities for biomarker-informed recruitment for screening and risk reduction."
10934565,"Project 2: Integrating Biomarkers into Lung Cancer Risk Profiling
Summary
Screening by low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has revolutionized early detection of lung cancer, the
leading cause of cancer death. However, current eligibility criteria require participants to have a history of
heavy smoking exposure. People with many years of cessation are excluded, as are those who never
smoked. Currently, 30-50% of lung cancers occur in individuals who are not eligible for screening, and with
decreasing smoking rates, these numbers will increase. The overarching aim of Project 2 is to address this
challenge by leveraging complementary information from blood-based biomarkers to identify individuals
who have high lung cancer risk despite not meeting screening eligibility criteria.
Our project is a natural extension of the initial INTEGRAL program where we developed the novel
INTEGRAL protein biomarker panel which measures absolute concentrations of key risk biomarkers. In
INTEGRAL-AT Project 2, we aim to move the INTEGRAL panel towards clinical implementation, and also
update the panel with risk markers of lung cancer in never smokers. We will first establish a biomarker-
informed risk prediction model for smoking-related lung cancer. This will involve using the INTEGRAL panel
protein measurements on 1,700 lung cancer cases and 2,900 cohort representatives from the Lung Cancer
Cohort Consortium (LC3) to develop and independently validate a model that estimates the 3-year absolute
risk of lung cancer. Second, we will evaluate the acceptability of applying such a biomarker-based eligibility
criterion to screening participants. This will involve recruiting 1,000 individuals who are ‘nearly eligible’ by
US Preventive Services Task Force criteria within the St Elizabeth community based LDCT screening
program. Finally, we will carry out a de-novo proteomics discovery analysis on 616 never-smoking cases
and 616 matched controls from LC3 to identify novel protein markers for lung cancer in never smokers and
update the INTEGRAL panel to include these markers.
Our long-term vision is that by using personalized information from a risk-informative and readily
implementable multiplex protein-panel, lung cancer screening can be more precisely targeted to people at
high risk of lung cancer. This would allow a higher fraction of lung cancer cases to be detected early without
subjecting more individuals to LDCT screening, thus optimizing the benefit-to-harm ratio. We also envisage
that this panel will be highly useful outside the screening context to work up never-smoking patients with a
family history of lung cancer, with occupational exposures, or who present with symptoms."

 Ion channels pass charged ions through lipid membranes in a regulated manner. Ion channels
play major roles in regulating electrically excitable tissues, sensing and responding to the
environment, and maintaining cell homeostasis. Over 70 ion channels have been linked to Mendelian
“channelopathy” disorders, affecting a diverse set of organ systems. As genetic testing and genomic
medicine become prominent, an important challenge is to understand the spectrum of which
mutations in ion channel genes cause disease. Unfortunately, a large fraction of variants are currently
annotated as “Variants of Uncertain Significance,” which limits the effectiveness and potential of
genomic medicine.
 This proposal seeks to decipher which variants in channelopathy genes cause disease. We will
first use large biobank datasets with linked genome sequencing and phenotype data. We will examine
associations between genetic variants in 76 channelopathy genes and relevant disease phenotypes.
Using control pathogenic variants, we will first determine which gene-phenotype pairs are associated
in biobank datasets, then discover novel candidate disease-associated variants that are present in
carriers with relevant disease phenotypes. Next, we will use high-throughput automated patch
clamping to study hundreds of variants in ion channel genes. Our initial focus will be 5 key ion
channel genes that span a range of ion types and organ systems, as well as selected variants from
the biobank genetic analyses. Next, we will perform deep mutational scans (a comprehensive
mutational study) of every mutation in selected ion channel genes, starting with GABRA1, a ligand-
gated ion channel gene (receptor) involved in GABA sensing and linked to seizure disorders. We will
generate all possible mutations with degenerate mutagenesis reactions, integrate the mutation library
into cells, then measure each mutation's impact on cell surface trafficking and channel function using
high-throughput sequencing. Finally, we will integrate these patient and in vitro functional datasets to
learn fundamental features of ion channel biology and disease. Through an analysis of the 2D and 3D
protein structures, we will decipher protein mutational hotspots. From an analysis of mutational
impacts from homologous genes I will determine whether mutation information can be ported to
homologous genes. Finally, we will integrate variant data into the American College of Medical
Genetics classification framework to clinically reclassify variants. Overall, these experiments have
great potential to help resolve the VUS problem for ion channels and decipher novel ion channel
biology."

We and others have genetically and functionally characterized the contribution of recurrent somatic alterations
to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) pathogenesis, including IDH1/IDH2 mutations. This has led to novel insights
into AML pathogenesis and led to the identification and validation of IDH1/2 inhibitors as a therapeutic
approach in AML; the first small molecule IDH1 (ivosidenib) and IDH2 (enasidenib) inhibitors are now approved
for relapsed/refractory IDH1/2 mutant AML. However, not all patients respond to IDH1/2 inhibition and a subset
of patients relapse following responses to IDH inhibition. We will use preclinical studies and analysis of primary
samples from patients treated with IDH1/2 inhibitors to delineate molecular predictors of sensitivity and
resistance to IDH inhibitors, and to test new combination therapeutic approaches to increase therapeutic
efficacy in IDH1/2-mutant AML. This will include mechanism-based clinical trials in genetically defined subsets,
including a novel, mechanism-based clinical trial combining FLT3 and IDH1/2 inhibition in patients with
concurrent mutations. Project 1 will interact with all 3 other Leukemia SPORE research projects and will utilize
all core facilities in this program. Our collaborative efforts will include genomic interrogation of patient samples,
preclinical therapeutic and mechanistic studies, and clinical trials with extensive correlative science aimed to
nominate the best combination therapeutic approaches for AML patients with IDH1/2 mutations."
10906840,"Pediatric diarrheal diseases are a major cause of mortality among children under 5 years old. Rotavirus (RV) is the leading cause of diarrheal diseases in children, with an estimated 258 million cases and 200,000 deaths each year worldwide. Importantly, RV studies have long been used to establish a foundational understanding of enteric virus pathogenicity. Thus, in addition to representing a global health burden, RV provides a model from which we can gain insight into other viral processes. A hallmark of RV infection is dysregulation of Ca2+ signaling which underlies many aspects of enteric virus pathogenesis and disease. Until recently, this dysregulation was described as a monophasic increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Using state-of-the-art live imaging, we found that RV infection results in distinct Ca2+ signal events that mimic previously characterized endogenous signals. These include intracellular Ca2+ puffs early in infection, and later “intercellular Ca2+ waves” that involve paracrine signaling from RV-infected to surrounding uninfected cells. RV nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) is responsible for dysregulating Ca2+ homeostasis. Through distinct protein domains, RV NSP4 functions as a viroporin (VD), causing Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum, and an enterotoxin (ED), which elicits a receptor- dependent transient Ca2+ signal. While these domains are known to be involved in Ca2+ signal dysregulation, their relative contributions to replication and pathogenesis remain poorly defined. The overall objective of this research is to characterize NSP4 VD and ED functions, delineate how these domains contribute to the aberrant RV-induced Ca2+ signals and determine the role Ca2+ signaling plays in RV replication and pathogenesis. In Aim 1 we will characterize the role of NSP4 VD and ED in RV-induced Ca2+ signaling and RV replication. We have generated a panel of novel RV strains with targeted VD and ED mutations. Our extensive experience with RV reverse genetics, Ca2+ signaling, and enteric physiology make us well-suited to investigate this gap-in-knowledge. Further, our team first identified both NSP4 enterotoxin and NSP4 viroporin functions and is thus aptly poised to address these questions. We anticipate that most NSP4 VD mutants will attenuate early RV-induced Ca2+ signaling and viral replication. We generally expect mutations in NSP4 ED will attenuate later Ca2+ signaling, specifically paracrine signaling to adjacent cells. In Aim 2 we will determine the contributions of NSP4 VD and ED to RV pathogenicity ex vivo in human intestinal enteroids and in vivo in neonatal mice. We predict that through distinct functions, NSP4 VD and ED mutants will attenuate RV diarrhea and chloride secretion and will contribute to different aspects of pathogenicity. Collectively, these experiments establish new concepts about mechanisms of viral exploitation and mimicry of host signaling and pathophysiology, provide insight for improved vaccine efficacy, and illuminate targets that might be exploited for novel therapeutic targets."
10899448,"Abstract
Infectious osteomyelitis (OM) is an inflammation-driven disease of bone that culminates in pathological
alterations in skeletal architecture. Bone infections are multifactorial and reflect a complex interaction between
microorganisms and host cells. Staphylococcus (S.) aureus, a pathogen that has developed antibiotic resistance,
is the leading cause of bacterial-induced OM and has been identified as one of the greatest bacterial threats to
global public health. These infections are painful, debilitating and can become chronic or recur years after the
initial event. The pathogen’s ability to damage bone tissue and evade clearance by the immune system, even
with appropriate antibiotics, impose significant obstacles to treatment of OM. The first and most critical level of
host defense against infection by S. aureus is innate immunity, primarily mature myeloid lineage cells such as
neutrophils and macrophages; the success of this pathogen is dependent on its ability to evade and exploit these
responses. While much has been learned about interactions between myeloid cells and S. aureus, relatively little
work has specifically focused on infections of bone. This microenvironment presents unique features, including
relative hypoxia, abundant immature myeloid cells, and the presence of unique bone cells – osteoclasts (OCs),
osteoblasts, and osteocytes - that interact with both the bacteria and innate immune cells. Furthermore, the route
of infection - via injury or direct soft tissue extension, surgical implants, or hematogenously spread – can
significantly alter the interactions between bacteria and bone, especially during early stages of infection. Notably,
OCs differentiate from monocytic precursors, providing an inherent link between immature myeloid lineage cells
and bone homeostasis. The overall goal of this application is to understand the host-pathogen interactions
between the bone’s OC and neutrophil lineage cells and S. aureus during the establishment, progression, and
resolution of OM. Our preliminary studies strongly implicate the interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling axis as a driver of
both antibacterial immunity and pathologic bone changes during OM. Following infections such as with S. aureus,
IL-1 family members including IL-1β are canonically generated through the activation of multi-protein complexes
known as inflammasomes. However, little is known about the role of inflammasomes in the pathogenesis of OM.
We have found that, compared to their uncommitted precursors, OCs have lower inflammasome activation and
are permissive of intracellular S. aureus proliferation. We hypothesize that differences in inflammasome activity
within myeloid lineage cells present in bone affect the pathogenesis of OM, with S. aureus exploiting those cells
with weaker inflammasome and antimicrobial responses as a proliferative niche while leading host cells with an
excessive inflammatory response to cause tissue damage. Aim 1: Define host and pathogen determinants of
inflammasome activation in the OC lineage in OM. Aim 2: Define the mechanisms and impact of inflammasome
activation in the neutrophil lineage by S. aureus in OM. By examining and manipulating the host-pathogen
interactions in specific myeloid cell populations, we will learn how to tip the balance towards resolution of OM."

During the hair cycle, growing hair follicles (HF) regress in a phase marked by progenitor death and follicle
remodeling (catagen), before a rest period (telogen) and new hair growth (anagen). Signals from the dermal
papilla (DP) – a key signaling center – regulate progenitor proliferation and differentiation in the bulb of growing
HFs, and induce bulge/germ stem cells (SC) to regenerate fully growing HFs. During catagen regression, the
DP needs to relocate from the base of growing HFs to the SC reservoir in the upper HF, traversing the skin
several hundred micrometers. How this is accomplished has been unknown for decades. In the first funding
period, we have uncovered that the follicle-lining dermal sheath (DS) is a smooth muscle that contracts to
physically relocate the DP to reach its essential SC-adjacent position. The dynamic molecular changes that occur
in adjacent progenitors and the DS and whether epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk between them regulates
contraction is unknown. Exploring our DS and several other gene signatures suggested an intriguing role of
endothelin signaling, a well-known vasoconstriction regulatory pathway, in controlling DS contraction. With
several established and newly developed functional assays and novel genetic DS targeting, we have now
established the conditions for exploring the dynamic expression of endothelin ligand, receptor and other pathway
members in progenitors, DS and DP during both growth and regression; for investigating the functional role(s)
of progenitor-derived endothelin in signaling and activating contraction; and for dissecting the downstream
pathway mechanism(s). Overall, we will rigorously test the hypothesis that follicle progenitors and the DS engage
in epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk crucial for regulating DS contraction and hair cycle regression. We will
precisely map expression localization and timing of key endothelin signaling pathway members through detailed
in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence analyses. We will further purify DS and progenitors with novel
multicolor isolation methods from growing and regressing follicles and analyze their transcriptomes to define
potential signaling crosstalk in general and all components of the endothelin pathway system in particular. We
will pharmacologically activate and block endothelin signaling activation in isolated DS cells and microdissected
follicles, and determine functional DS contraction in our recently established in vitro and ex vivo live imaging
assays. We will then explore the consequences of contraction inhibition in vivo and directly visualize contraction
inhibition with intravital imaging. We will perform timed genetic receptor and ligand ablations and assess the
impact on follicle regression. Finally, we will define the spatial and temporal calcium signaling dynamics
downstream of endothelin pathway activation using calcium reporter mice and activators and inhibitors of Ca2+
channels as well as of the PLC/PKC activation to dissect the major endothelin signaling pathway branches that
operate to activate DS contraction. With this work will define a key physiological function of progenitor-DS
interaction, which may be useful for hair regeneration approaches, including manipulating follicle regression."
10806188,"Model organisms have proven invaluable as more tractable systems to study fundamental principles of biology and by yielding breakthroughs that result from studying evolutionary innovations, for example, GFP, from jellyfish, or CRISPR, from bacteria. My goal is to leverage a new model system, developed during my postdoctoral work, that is uniquely positioned to provide insights of both types: Clytia hemisphaerica, a species of Mediterranean jellyfish.  This proposal uses Clytia's distinctive features to identify precise mechanisms at the interface of neural development, neural regeneration, and systems neuroscience. First, Clytia are tiny (<1mm-1cm), transparent, and genetically tractable, making it possible to image and manipulate the activity of every neuron in the nervous system simultaneously, in vivo, using genetically encoded optical techniques. Further, Clytia numerically scale their nervous system at least an order of magnitude during their lifespan without disrupting system function, ending with more than ten thousand neurons. It is therefore also possible to observe continuous differentiation, migration, axon targeting, and functional activity simultaneously across the whole organism. Lastly, Clytia have poorly understood and powerful regenerative capabilities. These include the regeneration of large populations of genetically ablated neurons, with rapid recovery of the behaviors that those neurons control. These properties make Clytia an experimentally tractable platform to investigate:  · Fundamental questions in systems neuroscience, including mechanisms underlying behaviors and behavior states, roles of neuromodulation, and approaches for studying system organization and function across scales.  · Basic principles of neurodevelopment, particularly at the interface of development and function.  · Mechanisms enabling regeneration and the seamless integration of new neurons into a functioning network. In Aim 1, I will characterize the molecular phenotypes of neurons and establish CRISPR-based knock-in to target effectors to specific subpopulations of cells. In Aim 2, I will use a coordinated behavior as my point of entry and develop and test models of underlying neural mechanisms. In Aim 3, I will examine how this behavioral system is robust to constant neurogenesis, and the mechanisms that enable its rapid recovery following genetic ablation of neurons.  My vision is that, once the key foundational work has been completed and published, Clytia will become a widely used model system. This proposal serves as the first step, laying the foundation for my future independent program and for a Clytia community more broadly, and providing the essential training that I need to fill gaps in my knowledge, focusing on computational and single-cell RNA sequencing approaches."

10912593,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The world's population is aging. Since most of older people have at least one but more commonly multiple
debilitating chronic diseases, this demographic shift will result in a dramatic increase in morbidity and a burden
on our healthcare systems. This U19 proposes an integrated study to test a new approach for developing
therapies for age-related diseases. Rather than focusing on individual diseases, we explore genetic differences
between successfully aged, healthy centenarians and control individuals with no family history of extreme
longevity. Our long-term goal is to use gene variants found enriched in the centenarian genome as potential
targets for developing drugs that prevent, delay onset and progression, and possibly even revert many of the
multiple age-related diseases. The overall objective of Project 1 is to elucidate genetic variants enriched in the
centenarian genome, based on our central hypothesis that rare variants constitute an important part of the
genetic architecture of human aging and influence human lifespan on the polygenic risk background defined by
common variants. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of our recent whole exome sequencing
study of longevity using the Einstein centenarian cohort and will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (I) To
identify and replicate rare variant-based longevity association; (II) To develop an integrated common variant-
based polygenic score of longevity; and (III) To study gene regulatory pathways associated with extreme human
longevity using single-cell and single-molecule analyses of centenarian blood cells. The research rationale for
Project 1 is that such variants can be functionalized by Projects 2 and 3 and used as targets for drug screening
assays to be developed by Project 4. Our proposed research will have an important positive impact: better
understanding of the genetics of extreme human longevity provided by our study of centenarian cohorts will
enable us to identify novel therapeutics that slow or mitigate aging and all associated diseases."

healthspan. This overwhelming evidence raises hopes for new drugs that slow the aging process and attenuate
age-related disease in humans by modulating these conserved pathways of aging. In Project 2 (old Project 1),
we have been conducting the experiments aimed at exactly this goal: To identify and functionally characterize
genetic variants in the conserved pathways of aging that are associated with human healthy aging and extreme
longevity for therapeutic modulation to improve human healthspan and lifespan. We demonstrated through cell
models that longevity-associated rare coding variants in SIRT6, USP35, and UBE3C alter protein function and/or
expression which antagonize age-related deleterious changes in human tissues and during cellular senescence.
We found the same aging-antagonizing effects of longevity-associated non-coding variants in SMAD3 and the 3
genes (NFKBIA, CLU and PRKCH) involved in the PKC/NF-B signaling pathways. In the renewal application,
Project 2 proposes to confirm and extend our observations by taking a systematic multidisciplinary approach.
The objective of Project 2 is to identify and directly test the impact of causal variants, whose genetic perturbations
underlie the association with longevity. Our approach is to use high-throughput screening methods, such as
INtegrated PrOtein INteractome perTurbation screening (InPOINT) for coding variants and Massively Parallel
Reporter Assay (MPRA) for non-coding variants, and to investigate the underlying mechanisms using CRISPR-
engineered human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC), multiple cellular differentiation paradigms, multiomics
approaches, and functional analysis composed of molecular, biochemical, and cellular assays. Our functional
analyses of longevity-associated variants in SIRT6, USP35, and UBE3C point to their potential role in protection
against age-related cognitive decline and risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and on the phenotypes of cellular
senescence, which are increasingly implicated in neurodegenerative disease. Thus, we will focus on the aging-
antagonizing effects of the SIRT6, UBE3C, and USP35 coding variants in the context of cognitive health and
protection from AD. The ultimate impact of Project 2 lies in its potential to reveal conserved pathways as
fundamental mechanisms of aging in humans and as therapeutic targets for healthy aging, in close collaboration
with Projects 1, 3, 4 and Core B."

The goal of the Nebraska Center for Molecular Target Discovery and Development (CMTDD) is to establish and
expand physical and intellectual resources at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) and the
University of Nebraska system to catalyze the identification, validation, and development of approaches for
manipulation of molecular targets implicated in clinically important diseases. We perceive an increasing
expectation by journals and granting agencies for progressively sophisticated model systems and data sets.
Acquisition of these systems and generation of high-content data often requires a substantial investment in time
and money that taxes limited research resources. To enhance the competitiveness of CMTDD Research Project
Leaders (RPLs) and other university faculty members during Phase 2, the CMTDD recently invested in the
development of technologies to enhance the sophistication of investigator research while minimizing the cost of
access. These technologies: single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analysis, organoid generation and
manipulation, and inhibitor and proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) synthesis will be integrated into three
Phase 2 CMTDD cores. These investments will enhance the research capabilities of the institution, expand the
translational capacity of its faculty, facilitate the training, mentoring, and career advancement of promising new
faculty, and efficiently drive discovery and development for the improvement of human health in Nebraska and
the nation. Phase 2 RPLs bring a breadth of cutting-edge expertise to the CMTDD. With mentoring and ready
access to CMTDD-supported cores, our RPLs will become self-supporting faculty members invaluable to the
future success of UNMC. Our Phase 2 RPLs share both a passion for exploration of the basic biologic principles
that underly cell homeostasis and a belief that many diseases can be effectively classified and characterized
through detailed genomic, genetic, and molecular analyses that identify drivers and vulnerabilities from which
will emerge unique therapeutic approaches. To realize this vision, the CMTDD will: 1) maintain an Administrative
Core and mentoring program that successfully graduated all but one of its initial RPLs in the first four years of
support; 2) increase research capacity through newly established state-of-the-art scientific cores for single-cell
and spatial transcriptomics, organoid development, and inhibitor and PROTAC synthesis and validation; and 3)
provide low- or no-cost access to these technologies and reagents as an affordable means for increasing the
impact of investigator research."

10716177,"The Mission of the Brain Rehabilitation Research Center (BRRC) is:
 Maximize recovery of cognitive, emotion, and motor function in Veterans affected by neurologic injury or
 disease by potentiating neural plasticity and neural network reorganization through the discovery of
 mechanisms and innovation of treatments.
 The BRRC is a 19-yr consortium with three major institutions: North Florida/South Georgia VA Health Care
System, University of Florida (UF)/Shands Healthcare, and Brooks Rehabilitation Hospital. The BRRC
supports > 28 investigators (14 PIs with VA-funded studies, 14 associate investigators, and additional
collaborating investigators) and their teams. The BRRC supports a collaborative, interdisciplinary research
team, providing extensive facilities and resources for sophisticated human performance and brain function
measurement. Our planned research programs utilize specific neuroplastic mechanisms to recover cognitive,
emotion, and motor function. First, in the Cognition Function Initiative, we are developing innovative treatment
for impaired memory, executive function, and goal achievement in TBI survivors. Second, in the Emotion
Function Initiative, we are establishing new brain neuromarkers for objective diagnosis of PTSD and prediction
of psychotherapy response in the presence and absence of TBI. We are investigating the etiological,
pathological and neurophysiological mechanisms of PTSD comorbid with TBI, identifying brain networks
involved in the emotional consequences of PTSD/TBI, and testing novel interventions to aid in recovery of
emotion regulation. Third, in the Motor Function Initiative, we are investigating brain activation mechanisms
during walking and during upper limb movement, to elucidate pathology and identify more useful treatment
targets for inducing motor recovery. We are developing and feasibility-testing a new brain neural feedback
regimen (real time brain imaging) to improve upper limb function after stroke. We are testing several
innovative gait training interventions for stroke survivors: combination of gait coordination and brain stimulation;
backward walking training paradigm; enhancing sensory feedback during walking and testing emotional fear
factors related to fall self-efficacy; and feasibility-testing a protocol for a comparative effectiveness trial, for
long-term mobility and health for chronic stroke. Fourth, in the Rehabilitation Neuroscience Initiative (animal
and human models), we are refining our preclinical rodent models of TBI and SCI that reflect clinical symptoms
of chronic and persistent disabilities in human TBI/SCI. We are establishing reliable, quantitative, and clinically
translatable measures for assessing chronic multiple disabilities and for illuminating the role of TBI in chronic
human neurodegenerative disease. We are evaluating efficacy of combined interventions, such as locomotor
training and CNS stimulation, to mitigate TBI-induced disabilities. In stroke and TBI separately, we are
evaluating the impact of potential modifiers such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, and moderating biomarkers of
gene variants, brain structure/function, and inflammatory processes on cognitive impairment.
 The BRRC has consistently achieved the benchmarks expected by the RR&D Service, as follows:
* Thematically cohesive, neural plasticity research portfolio focused on RR&D high priority Veteran needs for
 those with neurological injury or disease.
* Robust science dissemination program, including national leadership by BRRC investigators.
* Active and successful capacity-building program, including support and mentoring across career stages.
* Excellent funding leverage ratio of Core Center award.
* Acquisition and stewardship of extensive facilities, equipment, and shared resources for investigators.
* Successful organizational model with a track record of strongly supporting investigators, inclusive budget
 planning process, visionary strategic planning process."

The American Consortium of Early Liver Transplantation-Prospective Alcohol-associated liver disease Cohort
Evaluation (ACCELERATE-PACE) study is a prospective longitudinal cohort of patients with severe alcohol-
associated liver disease (ALD) evaluated for early liver transplantation (ELT). The cohort leverages the
ACCELERATE consortium with 4-linked R01s and 5 additional recruitment sites in the South/Southeast, Mid-
Atlantic, Midwest, and West, and will refine and identify best practices in the selection and management of
patients with severe ALD considered for ELT across their continuum of care. ALD is now the most common
indication for liver transplantation (LT) in the U.S. Historically, LT centers required at least 6 months of alcohol
abstinence before LT referral and evaluation, though empiric evidence to support minimum sobriety periods was
limited. ELT, defined as LT before 6 months of abstinence, is increasingly performed but with significant practice
variability. There is no consensus on optimal ELT candidate selection, and selection criteria vary widely,
contributing to disparities in access to lifesaving care. ELT is also controversial due to the potential for liver
recompensation with abstinence, which would obviate the need for LT—accurate prediction of recompensation
has the potential to increase organ utility and stewardship. Detailed evaluation of the efficacy of alcohol use
disorder treatments and improved risk scores based on pre-LT psychosocial factors to predict return to alcohol
use are needed to refine selection criteria, optimize post-LT care, and effectively treat AUD. Short- and
intermediate-term survival after ELT is excellent, but the incidence and predictors of post-LT complications are
poorly defined. To fill these key knowledge gaps, we will enroll and prospectively follow 770 ELT
candidates and 270 ELT recipients for 3 years at 9 socio-demographically diverse centers. The proposed
Aims will: (i) inform ELT selection criteria and investigate potential sources of bias in ELT evaluation and
healthcare disparities in ELT access; (ii) develop risk prediction scores for LT-free survival and recompensation;
(iii) identify effective treatments (medical, behavioral) for alcohol use disorder among patients with severe ALD
and post-ELT; (iv) evaluate clinical outcomes among ELT candidates and recipients, including mortality,
transplantation, post-LT complications (e.g. cancer, cardiovascular events, graft rejection/failure), and quality of
life. A comprehensive data repository will include sociodemographic, clinical, geospatial, psychosocial,
behavioral, and patient-reported outcome variables. LT documents, checklists, recordings of selection meetings,
direct observations of LT procedures, and clinician interviews will identify best practices and pitfalls in candidate
selection. A biorepository of blood, urine, explant/donor tissue, pre- and post-LT liver tissue, peripheral blood
mononuclear cells, and cross-sectional radiologic imaging will inform future ancillary studies."
10908449,"Chronic heart failure (CHF) is one of the leading causes of death in the U.S. A primary characteristic of this
disease is elevated sympatho-excitation and exercise intolerance during physical activity. During exercise in
heart failure patients, extreme activation of the sympathetic nervous system is often seen and evokes an
exaggerated pressor response accompanied by hyperventilation. These abnormalities potentially increase
cardiovascular risk during physical activity in these patients. Experimental evidence suggests that 1) the
exaggerated sympatho-excitation during exercise is directly related to an increased sensitivity of the exercise
pressor reflex (EPR); 2) the enhanced mechanically sensitive afferent component of this reflex (i.e.
mechanoreflex) primarily contributes to the exaggerated EPR in CHF and 3) muscle metaboreflex activated by
femoral intra-arterial injection of capsaicin is blunted in CHF rats, which is associated with downregulated
Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid Type 1 (TRPV1) protein expression in lumbar dorsal root ganglia
(DRGs). The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying altered mechano- and metabo-sensitive afferent
limb in CHF have not been fully understood. Our preliminary data showed that myocardial infarct (MI) triggered
time-dependent macrophage infiltration into lumbar DRGs, suggesting that a neural inflammatory cascade
occurs in muscle afferent ganglia post MI. We hypothesize that macrophage activation in lumbar DRGs plays a
critical role in muscle afferent sensitization as well as the exaggerated EPR via regulating Kv channels and
glutamatergic signaling in CHF. We also hypothesize that macrophage activation in lumbar DRGs also serves
as an upstream mechanism to cause the TRPV1 channel dysfunction in muscle metabo-sensitive neurons in
CHF. In Aim 1, we propose to determine the time-dependent macrophage infiltration/activation in lumbar
(L4-L6) DRGs in post-MI male and female rats as well as post-MI CX3CR1CreER-tdTomato reporter mice. We will
also plan to identify the pro-inflammatory (M1)/anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotypes of macrophages in lumbar
DRGs post MI. Finally we will determine if pharmacological macrophage inhibition in lumbar DRGs can restore
the exaggerated EPR as well as muscle afferent sensitization in CHF male and female rats. Aim 2 is designed
to address how macrophages influence muscle afferent neuronal excitability post MI. We will determine if local
pharmacological macrophage inhibition in lumbar DRGs can restore altered Kv channels, TRPV1 channel and
glutamatergic dysfunction in CHF male and female rats. We will use highly integrative techniques including
molecular (real-time PCR, western blot, immunofluorescence and tissue clearance), cellular (patch clamp) and
whole animal experiments (measuring EPR function, single afferent recording) to test our hypotheses in this
project. We believe that this proposed research will address important functional and mechanistic issues that
directly relate to the quality of life in patients with CHF. These data will uncover new targets for therapy in this
patient population."
10908364,"Abstract
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, irreversible, aging-associated, and ultimately fatal lung disease.
The median survival of pulmonary fibrosis patients is only 4-5 years. There is no treatment to reverse fibrosis
and cure IPF. Development of anti-fibrotic therapeutics is an unmet need in the treatment of IPF. The relentless
progression of IPF is due in part to the failure of fibrosis resolution. The development of therapies for IPF relies
on the comprehensive understanding of fibrosis resolution pathways. Accumulating evidence shows that
activation of BMPs signaling induces myofibroblast de-differentiation and fibrosis resolution. A key receptor, BMP
receptor II (BMPRII), in BMPs signaling has been shown to be reduced in fibrotic lungs; thus, restoration of
BMPRII in fibrotic lungs is a potential therapy to treat IPF. However, molecular regulation of BMPRII stability has
not been well studied. In our preliminary data, we discovered that (i) BMPRII is degraded in the lysosome system
in response to TGF-β1 and lipid peroxidation inducers, which play critical roles in the development of lung fibrosis;
(ii) Nedd4L stabilizes BMPRII; (iii) downregulation of Nedd4L reduced BMP4 signaling and the effects were
rescued by overexpression of BMPRII; (iv) overexpression of Nedd4L promoted de-differentiation of lung
myofibroblasts. Based on these novel observations, we hypothesized that Nedd4L promotes BMPRII stability
and facilitates BMPs/BMPRII-mediated myofibroblast de-differentiation and pulmonary fibrosis resolution. We
propose three Specific Aims to evaluate our hypothesis. First, we will determine the regulatory mechanisms by
which Nedd4L stabilizes BMPRII. We will identify the ubiquitination and Nedd4L docking sites on BMPRII and
determine the effect of Nedd4L-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination on BMPRII internalization and stability. Next,
we will determine if Nedd4L suppression is essential for TGF-β1- and lipid peroxidation-induced BMPRII
degradation. Finally, we will determine if Nedd4L facilitates lung fibrosis resolution through stabilization of
BMPRII and promotion of BMPs-mediated myofibroblast de-differentiation and inactivation. We will determine if
elevated BMPRII stability by Nedd4L facilitates myofibroblast de-differentiation in ex-vivo cultured lung
myofibroblasts. An inducible fibroblast specific Nedd4L depletion mouse will be used in both resolving and non-
resolving lung fibrosis models. The proposed studies will address key knowledge gaps regarding molecular
regulation of BMPRII stability and anti-fibrotic effects of BMPs/BMPRII. Success of the proposed studies will
suggest that targeting Nedd4L/BMPRII to rescue BMPRII expression in fibrotic lungs may lead to new
opportunities to halt pro-fibrotic progression and promote fibrosis resolution."

The controlled collection and processing of clinical specimens from patients with pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a critical activity for an efficient and comprehensive program in translational research
in the context of a SPORE grant. Accordingly, the Biospecimen Core (Core B) has one overarching aim: We will
collect, store, process, and distribute biospecimens from patients with a diagnosis of PDAC seen at this institution
to facilitate biospecimen-based translational research: We will collect malignant cell populations from tumors
(from pre-surgical and surgical biopsies). We will also collect normal pancreas, pre-malignant pancreatic lesions,
and peripheral blood from PDAC patients. Serum and plasma will be collected for correlative and future studies.
Specimens will be collected throughout each patient's disease course (initial presentation, pre-treatment, post-
treatment/follow-up), and, where appropriate, archival specimens from previous biopsies/etc. will be retrieved.
Particular attention to specimen procurement (e.g. rapid processing of tissue to preserve transcript profiles) and
quality control will be practiced. Specimens will be processed to cellular RNA, genomic DNA, whole genome
amplified DNA, and protein extracts as required for each study. We will also collect longitudinal patient cell-free
DNA samples for downstream analysis. Cellular populations will also be viably frozen or immediately processed
for patient-derived xenograft and/or organoid creation. Importantly, we will ensure that all specimens used for
research are extensively and accurately annotated with clinical (pre-treatment, treatment, and follow-up) data
and metadata utilizing the bioinformatics infrastructure at our institution. Expert pathologic review from a
dedicated GI pathologist will ensure high-quality annotation. The aims of this Core will be accomplished by
continuing the scope of our well-established Cancer Center Tumor Bank and prior PDAC SPORE Core B
successes and an on-going, funded effort to collect solid gastrointestinal malignancies at our institution.
Specifically, Core B will expand the number of PDAC patients from whom biospecimens will be collected, and
serve as a conduit (through data and specimen sharing) to allow for a broader variety of translational research
studies in PDAC malignancies, using new and previously banked biospecimens."

10914150,"RESEARCH PROJECT: ABSTRACT
The number of American Indians aged 65 and older will triple to 1,624,000 by 2050, while the number of those
aged 85 and older will increase 7-fold to 300,000. These demographic trends raise concerns about the population
prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) and its prodrome, mild cognitive impairment,
and the need for health care for ADRD. American Indians also experience a disproportionate burden of ADRD
risk factors, such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Available data on cognitive impairment and ADRD among
American Indian elders remain limited. Furthermore, the few existing studies on dementia in American Indians
have been limited to the midwestern and western US. There exists a need for studies that can estimate, track,
prevent, and, eventually treat ADRD. We also need to weigh the economic costs of appropriate public health
interventions for American Indians in the eastern half of the US. Accordingly, we propose the first population-
based study designed to systematically characterize ADRD among American Indian communities in the eastern
US. This effort will be a partnership between Washington State University, the University of Miami, and Wabanaki
Public Health, a tribally founded and directed public health district serving all 4 federally recognized tribes in
Maine, collectively known as the Wabanaki tribes. Approximately 875 American Indians aged 55 and older reside
in the service delivery areas of the 4 tribes, yet nothing is known about their cognitive function or clinical
prevalence ADRD or multiple cognitive impairment. We will use tribal rolls to invite all American Indians aged 55
and older to participate in a population-based epidemiologic study (n = 650, assuming 75% participation
based on prior Wabanaki response rates) to assess cognitive function and ADRD risk factors, and to identify
people with probable cognitive impairment or ADRD. We will also conduct a case-control validation study with
a subset of participants (n = 260) to validate our cognitive screening results against the results of a clinical
diagnostic interview, the gold standard in ADRD. Finally, we will conduct a health economics analysis of current
and future costs associated with ADRD. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Conduct an epidemiologic study of health
and lifestyle risk factors for ADRD and cognitive decline, and screen for prevalent ADRD and mild cognitive
impairment among Wabanaki tribal members aged 55 and older; 2) Conduct a case-control validation study
comparing screening results from Aim 1 to a clinical diagnostic interview; and 3) Use data from Aims 1 and 2 to
estimate current and future direct and indirect costs associated with ADRD and mild cognitive impairment
morbidity and treatment. Our study will contribute invaluable public health data for Wabanaki Public Health and
American Indians nationally, and contribute to the development of ADRD-related health interventions tailored to
the needs of Wabanaki communities and other American Indian populations."
10914155,"CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT 1: ABSTRACT
American Indian people in the US have experienced a long history of exploitative “helicopter research” in which
non-Native investigators arrive, collect data, and proceed to publish without regard to the community’s well-being
or wishes. In recent decades, the National Institutes of Health have made progress in increasing the number of
American Indian Principal Investigators, yet awareness is growing of the need to build capacity for community-
led health research outside of academia. The Wabanaki Public Health District, which serves the 4 federally
recognized tribes in the State of Maine, has identified research capacity building as a priority. Therefore, in
Capacity Building Project 1, Dr. Patrik Johansson and faculty at Washington State University will deliver a 12-
month program, “Wabanaki Grants, Epidemiology, Analysis, Research Design, and Undergraduate Program”
(GEARD-UP), that is tailored to the Wabanaki Public Health District’s research capacity-building goals. GEARD-
UP comprises monthly 2-hour sessions delivered synchronously and asynchronously by videoconference.
GEARD-UP will be offered over 3 consecutive years and all WPH employees will be invited to participate. Topics
include study design, epidemiology and biostatistics, qualitative research methods, geospatial epidemiology,
data visualization, grant writing, and strategic planning, with special emphasis on elder health and examples
from Alzheimer’s disease research. A supplemental hands-on lab course that runs concurrently throughout the
12 months will be available for attendees who wish to gain skills in data management and data analysis. Capacity
Building Project 1 will also support year-long internships that bring Wabanaki undergraduate students from the
University of Maine to Wabanaki Public Health for field-based experience with research and public health. The
internship program will be led by Dr. Rebecca Petrie, Co-Leader of Capacity Building Project 1. Lastly, this
Project will provide resources and support to accelerate Wabanaki Public Health’s progress towards public health
accreditation based on standards of the Public Health Accreditation Board. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Deliver
the 12-month GEARD-UP curriculum to provide education, mentoring, and hands-on training in health research
methods and grant writing for 45 Wabanaki Public Health employees; 2) Support internship programs in years
1-4 of the NARCH to provide American Indian undergraduate students with field-based research experience and
mentoring at Wabanaki Public Health; and 3) Facilitate accreditation for Wabanaki Public Health that positions
them to further elevate their research infrastructure. Capacity Building Project 1 will foster a culture of learning
among tribal employees, grow the pipeline of American Indian young adults seeking careers in public health,
and strengthen the Wabanaki Public Health Infrastructure. Importantly, Capacity Building Project 1 will also
provide a template to grow the internal research infrastructure for other American Indian communities in the
eastern US."
10914159,"CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT 2: ABSTRACT
Many American Indian communities view research with skepticism and even frank mistrust, in part because
research has historically been done in or on communities rather than with them. “Helicopter research” is a term
used in Native communities to describe investigators who fly in and out, staying only long enough to collect data.
While researchers are rewarded with funding and publications, Native people continue to struggle with poverty
and health disparities. Tensions between Native communities and researchers generally arise from conflicting
views about the priority of topics to study, research agendas, and the use and ownership of data, particularly
regarding issues of consent, confidentiality, secondary use of specimens, returning results to donors, the need
for advance review of publications, and data sharing. In light of such understandable concerns, investigators
have been advised to consider the concept of group harm and to extend regulatory oversight for tribal research
beyond the protection of individuals to include the protection of social groups. Other important concerns include
stigmatization of Native communities, relevance and applicability of the studies and their benefit for future
generations, and the need for information on research that community members can understand. These
concerns have led to reluctance to engage in research, unless the communities themselves participate in a
study’s design, implementation, and regulation. When these concerns are addressed through regulating
research, engaging communities, improving cultural competency of researchers, and transparency of research
procedures, research can be fruitful. The legacy of unfortunate circumstances and the resulting concerns have
spawned a new era of tribal oversight and regulation, manifested by the growing number of tribal Research
Review Boards, and their counterparts in urban Indian health organizations. Accordingly, Wabanaki Public
Health, a tribally founded and directed public health district serving the 4 federally recognized tribes in Maine,
seeks to establish a Wabanaki Research Review Board. The Research Review Board will facilitate timely and
thoughtful reviews, help investigators navigate regulations governing human subjects research, and serve as an
integrated pathway for current and future regulatory needs of Wabanaki Public Health and the 4 tribes. Our
Specific Aims are to: 1) Build a tribal Research Review Board that will augment the capacity of the 4 Wabanaki
tribes to self-govern, support and educate investigators and Wabanaki tribal members, and minimize research-
related community harm; 2) Ensure integrity of data, compliance with tribal and federal policies, and protection
of human subjects; and 3) Educate Wabanaki Public Health leaders and staff and identify strategies to sustain
the Research Review Board after grant funding ends. The Wabanaki Research Review Board promises to have
far reaching impact on Wabanaki Public Health’s efforts to regulate research and build the regional research
enterprise. The collaborative design of Capacity Building Project 2 will encourage high-quality, tribally regulated,
community-based research that improves the health of the 4 Wabanaki tribes."
10916359,"Project Abstract/Summary – Imaging Core
The Imaging Core provides cutting-edge equipment and training opportunities to support the labs in the Tumor
Microenvironment Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (TME CoBRE). Cellular and animal models of
disease are important tools for translational research projects that promote understanding of the factors that
influence the initiation and detection of tumors, progression of disease and the impact of potential therapeutic
targets. Project Leaders will have access to imaging equipment that spans from super resolution intracellular
imaging through to whole animal imaging. Rather than establish a new imaging core to support the proposed
projects, the West Virginia University Health Sciences Center (WVU HSC) has chosen to expand the successful,
existing imaging facilities through significant institutional commitments to provide the new equipment needed by
the PLs that will yield high scientific impact. During Phase I, the Imaging Core expanded with addition of a light
sheet microscope for 3D fluorescent imaging of entire tumors or organs from rodent models, a multiphoton
microscope for high resolution, intravital imaging, an MRI for non-invasive structural imaging in mouse models
and a new micro-ultrasound for measuring tumor volume and perfusion. This institutional commitment has also
included new space dedicated to the core, as well as support for salaries and service contracts. These
investments allow well-established cores to incorporate novel and cutting-edge technologies, as well as to
continue providing established services to the research community. Support of the existing core resources
provides efficiency of operations since the same staff will be able to operate and manage the new
instrumentation. The long-term goals of this core are to (1) establish novel treatment and imaging resources in
an existing core facility to support translational research projects targeting the tumor microenvironment and (2)
provide training and support for investigators using preclinical models to study cancer biology. All of the Project
Leaders in Phase I (including the Project Leaders in this application) have been supported by the Imaging Core,
and this need will extend into Phase II. This TME CoBRE-supported core will synergize with other Institutional
Development Award (IDeA)-funded projects including other CoBRE projects, the IDeA Network of Biomedical
Research Excellence (INBRE), and the IDeA Clinical and Translational Research Award (IDeA-CTR) to enhance
research competitiveness, improve therapy, and address health disparities, particularly in cancer. The Imaging
Core provides opportunities for collaboration with other Centers at WVU, resulting in the broadest impact of
CoBRE investment. Further, it is highly connected to the Flow Cytometry Single Cell Analysis Core Facility that
will provide additional analysis tools for characterizing the tumor microenvironment. The Imaging Core is
committed to mentoring and participates in the Technology Seminar Series in partnership with the other CoBRE
Cores to enhance both education and collaboration across the CoBRE-supported initiatives."

population and translational cancer research pilot projects from MCC’s Molecular and Cellular Oncology,
Cancer Prevention and Control, and Translational Oncology Research Programs, stimulating a high return on
investment of $15.16 per CCSG dollar. These projects have fostered five new extramurally funded grants and
have opened clinical trials that accrued 241 new participants. In close alignment with MCC’s scientific direction,
14 of the 17 projects are on topics that correspond to the center’s FY19-23 Research Priorities for the current
funding period, including those involving clinical and health disparity issues within the MCC catchment area.
Outside of the routine CCSG pilot award process, MCC also elected to use Developmental Funds to support
two interdisciplinary teams of researchers who ultimately successfully applied for a CCSG Supplement
designed to foster the development of multiproject research programs. Developmental Funds were also
invested in two developing Shared Resource Facilities (Oncogenomics and Patient-Oriented and Population
Sciences), which have supported research projects from all three MCC programs, and after careful annual
evaluation, have been approved by the MCC Director’s Council as fully functioning resources presented as
such in this CCSG application. Leveraged with philanthropic investment and institutional support,
Developmental Funds will also be strategically allocated during the upcoming funding period to address two
Specific Aims: 1) Cultivate innovative and collaborative science through the use of pilot grants in areas that
align with MCC’s FY24-28 Strategic Plan and Research Priorities and reflect the scientific aims of MCC’s three
Research Programs; and 2) Foster deeper collaboration across the UK campus through strategic partnerships
to fund innovative pilot awards and ensuring the continuation of community input through the CCSG pilot
review process. To achieve these aims, MCC requests $150,000 per year in Developmental Funds, allowing
the center to achieve several key objectives outlined in the Strategic Plan, including fostering research that
aligns with its research priorities, expanding transdisciplinary opportunities for research teams, and increasing
clinical studies that are informed by MCC basic research. MCC will also continue partnerships with other major
research centers across campus, allowing cancer research to have an impact far beyond what MCC alone can
achieve, and will foster the maturity of a new process by which Community Advisory Board members directly
contribute to the CCSG pilot reviews, allowing community input to inform and influence funding decisions."
10931394,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 3
Oncolytic viral (OV) therapy is a promising biological approach for treating solid tumors, with oncolytic herpes
simplex virus-1 (oHSV) being the most advanced. Indeed, the FDA has approved the use of the oHSV Imlygic®
for metastatic melanoma and more recently, G47Δ, marketed by Daiichi Sankyo, gained conditional approval for
GBM treatment in Japan. As a result of the close collaborations developed between the PIs on this program
project grant, we have recently made an oHSV that encodes for PTENα (oHSV-P10). This virus shows significant
antitumor efficacy against intracranial glioma in mice and has recently been licensed by Mesoblast for GMP
production and IND enabling studies for Phase 1 clinical testing.
Recent investigations into metabolic changes upon oHSV-P10 treatment led to the discovery of increased ATP
production and release into the tumor microenvironment. While the extracellular ATP (eATP) can act as a
stimulator of the immune system, its breakdown (via the ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73) produces adenosine
(eAd) which eventually dampens anti-tumor immunity. CD73 activity represents a significant rate limiting step in
this process by converting ATP to adenosine. The overall goal of this application is to evaluate how oHSV
antitumor activity may be improved by suppressing the conversion of extracellular ATP (immune stimulatory) to
eAd (immune suppressive) through CD73 blockade.
In preliminary results we have identified a novel human antibody that can recognize and functionally block human
CD73 activity. While we are pursuing the translational development of this antibody outside of this grant, here
we propose to evaluate the impact of CD73 blockade using this antibody on oHSV anti-tumor efficacy. In this
project proposal, we hypothesize that CD73 inhibition will synergistically combine with oHSV therapy by
enhancing anti-tumor efficacy. This research will elucidate the role of the ATP/adenosine balance in the tumor
microenvironment. In Aim 1 we will identify the human antibody fragment that efficiently inhibits CD73 function
in combination with oHSV-P10. In Aim 2: we will evaluate the impact of newly generated oHSV-P10-αCD73 on
anti tumor efficacy. In Aim 3 we will evaluate the impact of oHSV-P10-αCD73 alone and in combination with
Avastin (anti-VEGF, frequently given to recurrent GBM patients) on efficacy and anti-tumor immunity."
10894844,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Overall
Mood and Anxiety Disorders are the most prevalent and disabling mental health conditions worldwide, yet
there are limited explanatory and predictive disease models available for these conditions. The theme of the
Neuroscience-based Mental Health Assessment and Prediction (NeuroMAP) CoBRE is based on the premise
that experimental designs that use transdiagnostic approaches (i.e., processes that cut across disease
categories) with multiple levels of analyses (symptoms & behavior, circuits & physiology, cells & molecules)
can identify disease modifying processes that can become targets of interventions. Phase I of NeuroMAP
recruited 8 RPLs and 8 PPIs. As of 6/2022, they applied for 99 extramural grants, received 8 federal grants,
and published 130 papers linked to the P20. Two underrepresented minority investigators using NeuroMAP
Core data received prestigious Maximizing Opportunities for Scientific and Academic Independent Careers
(MOSAIC) K99/R00 awards. Prior to the NeuroMAP CoBRE (funded 9/15/2017) the annual NIH funding for
LIBR was $662,104 (NIH Reporter accessed 6/17/2022), for 2021/22 the annual funding is $7,555,510
($5,368,214 without the CoBRE), which is a 11.4 (8.1)-fold increase. The goal for Phase II of the NeuroMAP
is to maintain and expand the infrastructure for RPLs. The Specific Aims of NeuroMAP are: (1) To expand
the critical mass of investigators that are focused on Neuroscience-based Mental Health Assessment and
Prediction approaches to mood and anxiety disorders. (2) To provide an operational infrastructure that
provides the tools necessary to conduct research projects, standardize assessments, and provide a data
repository for future pilot projects. (3) To provide a mentoring and career development infrastructure to junior
investigators to conduct studies focused on targetable, disease modifying processes in mood or anxiety
disorders. NeuroMAP will consists of: (a) an Administrative Core (Paulus); a Recruitment and Assessment
Core (Aupperle & Khalsa), a Circuit and Molecules Core (Rohan & Savitz), and a Data Management and
Statistics Core (Kuplicki & Thompson). There are three proposed projects: (1) Transcranial Direct Current
Stimulation: Threat Sensitivity target (Ironside) - External Mentor: Monique Ernst, NIMH; Internal Mentor:
Robin Aupperle, LIBR. (2) The effects of aversive interoceptive states on the computations and associated
neural basis of avoidance behavior (Smith) - External Mentor: Philip Corlett, Yale University; Internal Mentor:
Jennifer Stewart, LIBR. (3) Modulating repetitive negative thinking related brain networks in young adults
with depression (Tsuchiyagaito) - External Mentor: Kate Fitzgerald, University of Michigan; Internal Mentor:
Jonathan Savitz, LIBR. The goal of Phase II is to expand research in mood and anxiety disorders, build a
bigger base of funded investigators, and to attract more young talent to delineate the processes that
contribute to individuals developing, recovering from, and relapsing to mood and anxiety disorders."

OVERALL - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Montefiore Einstein Cancer Center (MECC), formerly known as the Albert Einstein Cancer Center, is the
fourth oldest NCI-designated cancer center in the U.S., having received NCI designation in 1972, and is now
celebrating its 50th year as an NCI designated cancer center. The overarching mission of MECC is to reduce the
burden of cancer in the Bronx and the nation through exceptional cancer research, education & training,
community outreach and engagement, and provide compassionate care for all including historically marginalized
communities that face heightened inequities in cancer and social determinants of health. Our Bronx catchment
area is home to 1.5M residents, and we serve one of the most racially and ethnically diverse populations and
one of the poorest communities in the U.S. To achieve our mission, MECC has 132 members organized into 4
Research Programs (RPs): Tumor Microenvironment and Metastasis (TMM), Stem Cell and Cancer Biology
(SCCB), Cancer Therapeutics (CT), and Cancer Epidemiology, Prevention, and Control (CEPC). The science of
these RPs is facilitated by 8 Shared Resources (SRs). All MECC RPs conduct cancer-focused research that is
relevant to the Bronx catchment area, and this science is greatly facilitated by the Office of Community Outreach
and Engagement (COE). The MECC COE is the main vehicle by which our Center understands, engages with,
and serves the needs of the underserved communities in our catchment area, and it plays a critical role in
facilitating the Center’s research that is relevant to the catchment area. Our Cancer Research Training and
Education Coordination (CRTEC) programs are well integrated with the four RPs and with our COE initiatives.
Moreover, the MECC is focused on creating a diverse pipeline for the next generation of cancer scientists and
clinicians. With the arrival of the new Director in October 2020, MECC has engaged in several transformative
processes, which include the following: (1) created a new MECC Strategic Plan; (2) appointed 9 new Senior
Leaders and 8 Program Leaders; (3) restructured the RPs to more tightly align and focus cancer research and
to more effectively foster transdisciplinary collaboration and translational research; (4) tightened MECC
membership criteria to enhance cancer focus; (5) formed 7 new internal MECC committees and 2 new MECC
external committees to enhance organizational capabilities; (6) created Offices for COE and CRTEC; (7)
appointed a new Associate Director for Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity (DEI); (8) created a new Department of
Oncology that is more tightly aligned with MECC; (9) formed a Cancer Service Line Executive Committee and a
new funds flow model to MECC; (10) recruited 42 new faculty that span the entire spectrum of cancer-focused
science; and (11) established a Women’s Task Force to enhance gender balance and diversity.

10915664,"The B cell population in each individual produces an estimated 1010 different antibodies, collectively known as
the antibody repertoire. This extraordinary diversity is essential for responding to the unique history of
infections, vaccinations and cancer encountered over an individual’s lifetime. Conversely, regulatory errors in
the system play a pivotal role in a host of auto-immune diseases. Antibodies are composed of two proteins, a
heavy and light chain, each containing a variable region, VH and VL, which together confer antigen binding
specificity. Diversity is initiated through differential recombination at the three V region encoding loci to produce
the naïve repertoire. Upon antigen exposure, B cells expressing an antibody specific to that antigen undergo
clonal expansion and concentrated somatic hypermutation (SHM) of V region sequences that code for the
antigen recognition domain. Those clonally derived B cells (clonotypes) each express a different sequence and
thereby structural variant of the initial unmutated antibody. Cells expressing higher affinity variants are selected
for in a process known as affinity maturation. In this way, the mature repertoire is built from the history of
antigenic encounters by that individual. Efficient deciphering of that history could contribute to improving
human health in numerous ways from better clinical decision making to improved diagnostics and therapeutics.
Toward that goal, ongoing technological advances in both DNA/RNA sequencing, protein structure modeling
software and high-performance scalable computer hardware are making virtual repertoire scale antibody
structure and antigen screening attainable in the not-too-distant future.
In this Direct to Phase II application, we propose to build a software suite that bridges the gap between
genomics and structural biology enabling antibody repertoires to be deciphered and mined in exquisite detail.
To do so, we first leverage our highly extensible sequence assembler, XNG, to produce haplotype phased and
annotated sequences of the germline IG loci from which the naïve repertoire can be simulated (Aim 1). Next,
XNG is used to assemble and annotate bulk BCR-seq data producing the linear VH and VL encoding
sequences of the mature repertoire (Aim 2). Translated repertoire sequences are then used as input for our
protein modeling software, NovaFold-Ab and NovaFold-AI, where high accuracy 3D antibody structures are
predicted (Aim 3). Those antibody structure libraries are then used in virtual screens to identify members that
bind to a target antigen with our protein interaction modeling program, NovaDock (Aim 4). Screens can also be
refined to specific epitopes of interest, for example, those known to elicit neutralizing antibodies. If realized,
these capabilities will have significant commercial opportunities for complementing existing technology in
improving clinical care and personalized medicine as well as aiding in the development of faster, more cost
effective diagnostics and therapeutics."

10894140,"SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Preserving late-life mobility, defined as the ability to walk safely and independently, is central to maintaining a
high quality of life, is critical for the performance of many activities of daily living and is necessary for
maintaining physical independence. Therefore, the continued development and standardization of tools that
can reliably assess physical functioning and disability status will be important for addressing the growing
challenge that societies worldwide will face with the expanding older population. The physical function
assessment core seeks to continue to provide the necessary infrastructure to perform standardized, valid and
reliable measures of musculoskeletal impairments, physical function, and disability across the spectrum of
observational studies and clinical trials embedded within, supported by, or associated with the Boston-OIAC.
The leadership of this core has collaborated extensively over the past project period, has unique experience in
the application of these measurements across a wide range of cross-sectional and intervention studies in older
adults, and has been on the leading edge of the development and refinement of new instruments and
technologies to assess domains of physical function and disability.
We propose to examine the following specific aims:
Aim 1: We will provide an organized infrastructure for FAC-supported procedures and activities across Tufts’
Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, and Brigham and Women’s Hospital Laboratory of Exercise
Physiology and Physical Function and serve as focal point for interdisciplinary collaboration by OAIC
investigators in the development, evaluation, and application of new and existing tools and instruments to
assess musculoskeletal impairments, physical function, and disability in older adults to evaluate the efficacy of
function promoting therapies.
Aim 2: We will provide direct measurement and consultative services, as well as assist with proposal
development for clinical studies supported by, or associated with, the theme of the OAIC that require measures
of musculoskeletal impairments, physical function, and/or disability. All Core services will use standardized
equipment and operating protocols for the assessment of muscle performance and functional limitations in
human studies, and will maintain extensive quality control procedures including: personnel training and
certification; equipment maintenance; and quality control.
Aim 3: We will develop novel and innovative approaches to assess musculoskeletal impairments, physical
function, and disability in older adults. The FAC will also support innovative developmental projects that seek
to develop or further validate innovative approaches to assess musculoskeletal impairments, physical function,
and disability in older adults."
10894143,"Summary
The preclinical studies are necessary for target identification and validation, for testing mechanistic
hypotheses, and for initial proof-of-concept studies in appropriate pre-clinical animal models and represent an
essential pre-requisite for advancing function promoting therapies (FPTs) to human trials. An important aspect
of translational research in model organisms is the underlying assertion that the physiological processes that
are evaluated in animal models are sufficiently similar to conditions observed in humans to allow dose and
effect extrapolation. Additionally, for the outcomes of preclinical studies to be meaningfully interpreted,
measurements must be reproducible, accurate, and sufficiently similar to the conditions observed in humans.
Accordingly, the Boston OAIC has established a Preclinical Discovery Core that offers standardized
procedures and state-of-the-art equipment for the analysis of muscle performance and physical function,
muscle bioenergetics, and non-invasive imaging and whole body metabolic outcomes. The PDC provides
standardized, state-of-the-art methods and instruments to assess body composition (lean body mass, whole
body and regional fat mass, skeletal muscle mass, functional microscopy of the muscle using high resolution
magnetic resonance imaging) in animal models of aging and disease to quantify outcomes in response to
function promoting therapies. The PDC also offers consultative services to early career investigators to
optimize study design, and guide the selection of appropriate experimental model and outcome measures.
The PDC has established standardized procedures for training and certification of its staff involved, and for
maintaining strict quality control in its procedures. The standard operating procedures have been approved by
the IACUCs of the participating institutions to enable streamlined transfer of animals from the participating
laboratory to the PDC facility. The PDC continues to innovate and provide novel measurement modalities to
facilitate FPT discovery. The PDC leadership has worked closely with equipment manufacturers to continually
refine the methods and improve the temporal resolution (signal to noise ratio), precision, and sensitivity of the
techniques that it offers. The proposed developmental project will apply an ultra-high-field 7-tesla Magnetic
Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) method for the non-invasive measurement of NAD+/NADH in the skeletal
muscle and brain enabling an in vivo assessment of mitochondrial efficiency without a tissue biopsy.
The PDC has become a unique resource for OAIC-funded REC and PESC projects, and for externally-funded
OAIC projects that are using preclinical models for FPT discovery research. The PDC supported studies have
facilitated several successful NIH grant submissions and peer reviewed publications by OAIC investigators."

The aim of the Boston Pepper OAIC is to support an interdisciplinary research program that fosters the
development of function promoting therapies (FPTs). Within the context of the OAIC's overall mission, the Pilot
and Exploratory Studies Core (PESC) will catalyze scientific advances in FPTs through funding of pilot and
exploratory studies, and provision of mentorship and infrastructural core support. The overall objective of the
PESC is to enable early stage investigator-initiated studies to acquire the pilot data needed to develop a
robust, well-funded, and productive translational research projects of FPTs. The primary objective of the PESC
in the context of this renewal is to build upon the science underlying our OAIC theme, while a secondary
objective is to help build the careers of scientists whose research is aligned with our theme. Aim 1 will
continue with our translational pipeline for early stage innovative and interdisciplinary research by providing
funding that leverages our Boston Pepper OAIC cores and infrastructure for the generation of proof-of-concept
preclinical data to expedite the development of FPTs, mechanistic studies for target identification or
hypotheses building by which FPTs exert effects on skeletal muscle and physical function; and pilot testing of
translational interventions or research protocols in human study participants or animal models for safety,
feasibility, or determination of optimal time course or dosage. Aim 2 will foster connectivity between PESC
investigators and OAIC resource cores. Aim 3 will catalyze pilot and exploratory projects into high quality peer-
reviewed publications, grant applications, and intellectual property/patents.
 Our Boston Pepper OAIC Steering Commmitteee selected three innovative candidate projects for
consideration of PESC support in our renewal, from among a pool of 19 applications that were received in
response to a widely advertised request for applications (RFA). These three canddidate projects are well
aligned with the OAIC's mission of promoting the development of FPTs by mechanism elucidation, target
identification, proof-of-concept studies in model organisms, epidemiolgical investigation, and randomized trials,
and would benefit from the use of our resource cores. The three projects are founded on innovative
hypotheses of the role of cellular senescence in interstitial lung disease and suboptimal outcomes of
transplanted organs from older donors, as well as epigenetic mechanisms by which early life stress affects the
trajectory of aging among transgender people. PES-1 evaluates whether transplanting older organs initiates
the spread of senescent cells through senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) linked
inflammatory programs that adversely influence physical function in older adults. PES-2 will examine the
role of senescence-associated biomarkers in improving the identification and prediction of early stage of
pulmonary fibrosis (PF) identified as interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA) based on pulmonary imaging. PES-3
will evaluate stress-driven acceleration of epigenetic age and inflammation in transgender adults."

OAIC’s productive and successful Biostatistical Design and Analysis Core. In keeping with the Core’s
complementary foci in statistical methodology and in contemporary analytics, and research software
development, this resource has been renamed the Biostatistics and Data Science Core (BDSC).
The overall goals of the BDSC are to provide biostatistical and data management support to OAIC projects;
collaborate with and provide consultation to OAIC investigators; to provide mentorship and training to
Research Education Component (REC) and Pilot and Exploratory Science Core (PESC) awardees; and to

The BDSC’s Specific Aims are:
Aim 1. To collaborate with OAIC investigators and trainees by providing biostatistical and data management
support to OAIC projects
Aim 2. To provide rigorous training in research design and data analysis for REC and PESC awardees, and
Aim 3. To develop and disseminate novel quantitative methods and data science and bioinformatics tools
aligned with the OAIC projects and priorities
Aim 1 builds upon the highly successful collaborations between the BDSC's faculty and the OAIC investigators,
reflected in more than 150 publications in the prior cycles. Aim 2 builds upon and extends our existing
biostatistical and data science curriculum, developed during the current cycle which is undergoing continuous
revision and improvement, and which is specifically tailored to provide quantitative science education both to
quantitative scientists and to allied clinical researchers in aging. Aim 3 extends our current efforts both in the
development of novel statistical methods in survival analysis, pragmatic clinical trials, longevity, and statistical
genetics; and in the development of novel software, reproducibility, and informatics tools now in extensive use
in the biomedical and Boston OAIC communities.
Together these aims will enable the BDSC to cost-effectively support the OAIC's research and training
initiatives. The productivity of prior cycles attests to the impact of the proposed Core on the OAIC's overall
success and underscores the potential value of its continuation to the Boston OAIC's mission."

The overall goal of the Boston OAIC REC is to train future independent research scientists who have
the knowledge and skills to translate fundamental mechanisms of disease and disability into novel
interventions that can improve the health, physical function, and well-being of people as they age.
The REC will achieve this by selecting the most promising early career (Pre-K Award) scientists from
clinical and basic science disciplines, and providing them with both collective and individual
educational activities, research experiences, mentoring, and career guidance that will enable them to
acquire future career development or research awards and ultimately become leaders in translational
research devoted to the discovery of function promoting therapies (FPTs). The REC’s specific aims
are as follows:
1. To select at least 6 talented early investigators from diverse clinical and basic science disciplines
who have strong potential to become independent investigators devoted to translational research.
2. To provide these trainees with two-year mentored research experiences focused on the
development of function-promoting therapies for people as they age.
3. To enhance the education of these trainees in relevant curricular areas through research seminars
and lectures, formal coursework, and specific training in the importance of diversity in science and the
protection of human and/or animal subjects.
By the completion of the proposed 5-year funding period, we will have selected and trained at least 6
promising new investigators in the field of aging. These early stage investigators will acquire the
necessary data, research experience, and mentorship to generate and test new hypotheses
regarding FPTs and compete successfully for independent funding for their future research. These
individuals will enrich the nation’s workforce with future leaders who will continue to develop new
interventions to promote physical function in old age and also train future generations of investigators
to continue vital work on this important theme."

 Advancing multidisciplinary biomedical research is significantly enhanced when there is support for
rigorous experimental design, analysis, and management of the increasingly vast datasets generated. The
UNH COBRE: Center of Integrated Biomedical and Bioengineering Research (CIBBR) substantially advanced
the biomedical research infrastructure at UNH during Phase 1 by significant CIBBR investments in state-of-the-
art instrumentation, augmented by additional institutional investments in high-throughput molecular diagnostic
screening and genomic sequencing capacity at the Hubbard Center for Genome Studies (HCGS). These
enhanced opportunities for multidisciplinary research collaborations and scientific training opportunities in
biomedical and bioengineering research catalyzed by CIBBR are now aligned with institutional commitments in
Phase 2 to conduct a cluster hire of early-career and senior-level researchers focused on the areas of
quantitative/computational biology and multi-omics.
 During Phase 1, UNH invested significant computational resources in the Research Computing Center, and
together with the HCGS established effective support for bioinformatic needs. However, important gaps persist
in biostatistical support services (including experimental design and implementation) as well in the
management and sharing of large multi-omics datasets. The objective for the Data Science Core (DSC) is to
enable researchers to adopt multi-omics technologies to enhance opportunities for rigorous, multi-disciplinary
research programs by: (1) providing a comprehensive support infrastructure for data analytics throughout the
entire data life cycle, thereby addressing the increasing need for statistical analysis and management of data
generated by multi-omics technologies; (2) promoting the FAIR principles of data science by implementing best
practices for data management and deposition; (3) creating training opportunities needed to support best
practices in Data Science; and (4) implementing a business plan to ensure the long-term sustainability of the
DSC infrastructure at UNH.
 Establishing a DSC that combines a full range of biostatistical and bioinformatics support services,
management of computational resources (including support for cloud computing), and provision of training
workshops will have a major positive impact for CIBBR investigators, the UNH research community, and our
IDeA-state collaborators. By supporting innovative data analytics approaches necessary for multidisciplinary,
multi-omics research that enhance rigor and reproducibility, the CIBBR DSC will become an indispensable
core facility offering a unified and critical set of support services to advance biomedical and bioengineering
research capacity at UNH."
10908504,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Walker, Project Lead)
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains a deadly disease despite recent new treatments. Therefore,
additional treatment strategies are needed. One of the main issues is the lack of a molecular target. The
transcription factor STAT3 is constitutively active in many triple-negative breast cancers. While inhibitors of an
upstream kinase Jak2 have been tested in the clinic, they have not shown efficacy as a single therapy. STAT3
can be activated by additional kinases which may be one reason for lack of response. Therefore, we
hypothesized that targeting the activity of STAT3 may prove a useful strategy since this would target STAT3
regardless of upstream kinase. However, no STAT3 inhibitors have been approved for treatment of TNBC.
Previously, we have found that activation of the related STAT family member, STAT5, in triple-negative breast
cancer cells modulated STAT3 activity and reduced the growth and sensitized these cells to chemotherapy. This
suggests that activating STAT5 could be a treatment for TNBC. However, as STAT5 has been shown to promote
some cancers, this is not a viable option. We have found that STAT5 competes with STAT3 on DNA binding and
gene regulation, suggesting that understanding the molecular effects of STAT5 on STAT3 activity could identify
new inroads for TNBC therapy. Preliminary data from ChIP-seq analysis identifies a subset of binding regions
within the genome that both STAT3 and STAT5 bind, particularly in regulating additional transcription factors.
Directed ChIP demonstrates that while STAT3 is dominant over STAT5 on a few sites, STAT5 is dominant over
STAT3 on numerous sites. This suggests that STAT5 modulates STAT3 activity by oppositely regulating several
genes that may play key roles in TNBC, raising the possibility that targeting STAT3 via STAT5 activity could
reduce the aggressiveness of TNBC and sensitize these cancer cells to chemotherapy. We hypothesize that
defining how STAT5 modulates STAT3 may lead to new treatment strategies that mimic the effects of STAT5
on STAT3. To address this, we will carry out the following specific aims. In aim 1, we will identify genes
differentially regulated by STAT3 and STAT5 in triple-negative breast cancer. In aim 2, we will assess the
biological effects of a subset of genes that STAT5 and STAT3 both regulate in TNBC. In aim 3, we will use a
new method to identify STAT3 and STAT5 cofactors at specific loci within the genome, providing us with a more
complete understanding on the competition between STAT3 and STAT5 on gene expression. We expect to
identify both the mechanism of differential gene regulation by STAT5 and STAT3 and identify key genes that are
differentially regulated by STAT5 and STAT3 in TNBC. Identifying these genes may serve as biomarkers or
targets for future treatment of triple-negative breast cancer by mimicking the effects of STAT5 activation on
STAT3 gene regulation."

 3.0 Technical Core
Abstract
The PORTENT Technical core describes our process for advancing promising global health relevant
point-of-care technologies for infection, cancer and nutrition towards clinical viability. We describe herein
(1) our process for soliciting and selecting new projects from the US, our clinical partners, and from around the
world, (2) how that process will be fundamentally guided by our annual needs assessment consensus, (3) how
we will support team building through our partnership network, (4) how the clinical core will enable deployment
and validation of the selected technologies, and (5) how the dissemination core will support: commercialization
through the global health lab-to-market accelerator, training of project participants, and dissemination of results.
To take maximum advantage of the resources we can deploy, at full capacity will focus on supporting 6-7 parallel
projects that either are beyond the proof-of-concept stage and would benefit from clinical validation, have been
validated or even commercialized domestically but are looking to expand to international settings, or have been
developed/incubated by our international partners and show promise at addressing a market need in the US.
Illustrative of what we will fund throughout the effort we provide four PoC project proposals originating from
Cornell, Columbia, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the St. Johns Research Institute (India) that we
intend to fund in year 1. These projects address specific needs which are defined in our initial needs
assessment consensus and include early screening of cervical cancer, comprehensive determination of
iron status enabling anemia screening, combined HIV and multiplexed detection of sexually transmitted
diseases, and broader, cheaper, and more accurate malaria testing. Each of these teams will partner with
at least one of our clinical sites to validate of their technologies and our dissemination core to train users workers
and engage developers in clinical rotations. Beyond year 1, new and continuing will be solicited from around the
world with our broadly disseminated RFP and selected based on a series pre-defined criteria which include: fit
with needs assessment consensus, technological readiness, milestones, contribution to capacity building, and
project team. By the end of year 5 we anticipate that we will initiate 20 independent point of care
technology projects, of which 30% will originate from outside the US and 80% will transition to a larger
funding opportunity, licensing arrangement or start-up company."

 4.0 Clinical Translation and Validation Core
Abstract
The Clinical Translation and Validation Core is a unique differentiator for PORTENT – one that has been
established through many years of capacity building by the leadership. Consisting of a one-of-a-kind
worldwide network of partner clinical sites in New York, Uganda, Ecuador and India, this network will
provide access to a much more diverse range of clinical populations, clinical and community expertise,
and biobanks than are currently accessible to PoC developers. The core has been structured to be
responsive to the needs of the center, allowing us to allocate funds and resources to sites where clinical support
is best matched to the validation and training needs of the projects. Each site will have a baseline budget to
enable local capacity building with the goal of further establishing them as recognized worldwide centers
of excellence in PoC diagnostic validation before the end of the proposed effort. The core will focus on four
main goals: (1) to enable human and clinical validation of PORTENT center and POCTRN network developed
Point-of-Care (PoC) technologies by providing access to a wide array of sample biobanks and unique patient
populations, (2) to support the design (including statistical support) of validation studies conducted by the project
teams, (3) to work with the Tech Core to identify new and existing PoC projects which can be transitioned to
human validation and the Dissemination Core to develop the annual needs assessment consensus, and (4) to
provide access sites for developer clinical rotations. The establishment of this clinical network will be
transformative to the development and translation of PoC devices for global health because it will
significantly lower the barriers for developers to target their technologies to this broader set of
populations. As noted in our needs assessment, patients in LMICs are some of the most vulnerable in the world
and are located where access to PoC technology could have the highest impact. Success with PORTENT could
significantly improve local health outcomes in these areas."

 5.0 Dissemination Core
Abstract
The PORTENT center represents a novel and rigorous approach to the development, deployment, and
commercialization of point-of-care technologies for global health. With the COVID-19 pandemic we have
seen the impact that accessibility to POC technologies can have and conversely the negative impact of their
absence. As we have outlined in our preliminary needs assessment in the Overall section the opportunity for
impact in areas with weaker accessibility to traditional healthcare is even greater.
While the opportunity is greater, so is the challenge. Needs assessment, the path to commercialization,
regulatory structures, training needs, and knowledge dissemination are all different than they are domestically.
To address this, we have assembled a dissemination core that is precisely designed to enable users to address
these challenges. Our dissemination core comprises of four key flagship elements that make it unique and
able to address this challenge: (1) a comprehensive approach to needs assessment that will draw on our
worldwide expertise and experience to develop an annual needs assessment consensus that will inform our
technology development efforts, (2) The establishment of a “Global Health Point-of-Care Diagnostics Lab to
Market Accelerator” that will provide commercialization and tech-to-market support for the PORTENT projects
specific for their technology and settings, (3) Unique training opportunity for healthcare workers, users and
technology developers on the use/creation of PoC devices enabled by our specialized AidSmart! App and
unique facilities, and (4) Dissemination through Knowledge transfer workshops that will broadly share the
outcomes with the PORTENT efforts with the global health and developer community. By year 5 of PORTENT,
we expect that at least 15 teams will engage in the Lab-to-Market accelerator program, we will train at
least 30 health care workers from LMIC countries in the use of point-of-care technologies, and we will
provide at least 20 clinical rotations for technology developers at one of our clinical sites. This integrated
core could become a model for global health diagnostic technology development and have impact well beyond
the PoCTRN program."
10918123,"More than 1 in 3 women are living with heart disease and many are unaware of the risks. Hypertension is a major
modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and ~47% of adults in the US have hypertension. In
~85% of cases, the cause of hypertension is unknown and only ~50% of patients taking medication achieve
blood pressure (BP) control to recommended levels. A critical barrier to limiting premature death from CVD is
lack of awareness surrounding the risks of CVD. Our location in the Southeast of the US will contribute to our
impact. The prevalence of hypertension and obesity are high in GA, MS, and SC. The prevalence of hypertension
and associated risk is not equal among all populations. Indeed, the prevalence of hypertension in Black people
in the US is among the highest in the world. Our overall goal is to transform academic and community
understanding of sex as a biological variable (SABV) in the consideration of hypertension. We will accomplish
this through the creation and dissemination of innovative educational content, the development of strategic
partnerships, and enhanced community engagement in the Southeast of the US. This SCORE is designed to
provide novel insight into the mechanisms controlling BP in females vs. males, develop a comprehensive
educational platform on SABV in CVD extending from grade school to medical school, and increase awareness
and education of CVD and the risks of uncontrolled hypertension in women across the health span through
community outreach. This SCORE has 4 objectives. Objective 1 is to conduct cutting edge research to advance
our understanding of sex-specific mechanisms that control BP to limit cardiovascular risk. Objective 2 is to
develop a culturally diverse research pipeline of biomedical scientists trained in the field of SABV in CVD.
Objective 3 is to establish a community outreach pipeline of trained scientists to increase awareness of SABV
and promote optimal cardiovascular healthcare for men and women. Objective 4 is to empower the community
to self-monitor and work to identify barriers to improving access to healthcare. The outcomes of our proposed
SCORE include not only advances in science and training of the next generation of leaders in the study of the
impact of biological sex on the development and progression of CVD, but also the development of a range of
educational content that will be fully available to the Consortium. This will include 1) the development educational
materials by medical illustrators for students/trainees at all stages, the community, and physicians, 2)
establishing a SABV Mentoring Academy, 3) creating a SABV curriculum and workshop for students, fellows,
and junior investigators. The impact of our work will be to increase recognition and awareness of the risks of
CVD and hypertension to women across their health span and best practices for SAVB experimental design.
Our comprehensive community outreach plan will also be critical to reach a highly at-risk population in the
Southeast of the US to increase routine cardiovascular health monitoring and decrease the overall CVD burden
on both the population and the healthcare system."
10912573,"PROJECT SUMMARY: POPULATION RESEARCH AND CLINICAL TRIALS IN CANCER EQUITY
(PRACTICE) SHARED RESOURCE CORE
The proposed Population Research And Clinical Trials In Cancer Equity (PRACTICE) Shared Resource Core
will build upon the infrastructure of the existing Clinical Trials Core (CTC) that has provided support to the
Meharry/Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center/Tennessee State University Cancer Partnership (MVTCP) since
its inception. While the CTC has been instrumental in bringing clinical trials to the patient base at Nashville
General Hospital (NGH) at Meharry Medical College (MMC), to more completely address cancer health
disparities, it is incumbent upon us to augment these efforts with studies in prevention, early detection,
treatment, survivorship and palliative care in the Nashville Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), served by
our Partnership. Therefore, we propose to establish the PRACTICE Shared Resource Core to further
benefit the NGH patient base, promote investigator-initiated research and extend the Partnership's reach
to the underserved in the Nashville MSA. The MVTCP has great strength in population sciences research
that will enhance the existing strength in clinical research. Examples include studies led by MMC,
Tennessee State University (TSU) and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) investigators working with
statewide cancer registries to recruit for etiologic studies of breast cancer, lung cancer screening trials for early
detection, a tobacco control trial in the underserved, enhancing participant recruitment to cancer research and
collection of biospecimens in collaboration with the Cancer Outreach Core and Translational Pathology Shared
Resource Core. There is also a rich history of conducting therapeutic clinical trials with interactions between the
Clinical Trials Office (CTO) at VICC and the CTO at NGH. The overarching mission of the PRACTICE Shared
Resource Core is to enhance accrual to therapeutic clinical trials while expanding access for minority and
underserved patients to research studies across the cancer care continuum. The PRACTICE Shared
Resource Core worked extensively with Lucy Spalluto, MD in the genesis of her proposed project examining the
implementation of breast cancer risk assessment in underserved women. We will assist with implementation of
this study and dissemination of the results. Our Core will also support other clinical and population-based science
research across the cancer care continuum. This can be broadly categorized into three thematic domains
focused on decreasing cancer health disparities: 1) prevention and early detection; 2) interventional trials and
observational studies during and following cancer treatment; and 3) implementation of healthcare interventions
to improve cancer care delivery. The PRACTICE Shared Resource Core will address the following specific aims:
1) expand the portfolio of therapeutic clinical trials and cancer control studies relevant to the patient base of
NGH at Meharry and the Nashville MSA; 2) develop a cancer cohort at NGH at Meharry to serve as a resource
for future studies across the cancer care continuum; and 3) provide training and mentorship for clinical trainees
in the conduct of clinical trials and in the recruitment and retention of underserved populations in research."
10904803,"Summary: 
The first and foremost goal of the Tissue Acquisition, Pathology, and Clinical Data (TAPCD) Core is to maintain 
and expand the existing repository for specimens, including tissues, blood and urine from patients with kidney 
tumors that have given consent to link their samples to clinical data. Included in this component are the 
collection, freezing, and storage of fresh samples of kidney cancer and paired non-tumor tissue; the collection, 
processing and storage of blood and urine; the identification and provision of samples of fixed tissues, 
including construction of tissue microarrays (TMAs) from biopsy and nephrectomy samples obtained from 
patients who have consented to allow analysis of these tissues. The caTissue system, which is the NCI 
caBIG's biorepository tool for biospecimen inventory management, is currently used to track specimens 
through every step of the requesting, shipping, and receiving process through the use of barcode technology. 
Importantly, the TAPCD Core will continue to maintain a database of clinical data (CRIS) on all consenting 
RCC patients. The value of the database is enhanced by the use of standardized pathology review procedures 
and data collection procedures. The database and specimen tracking system provide an informatics link 
among the participating Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) hospitals, including the Dana-Farber 
Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women’s Hospital (DFCI/BWH), the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 
(BIDMC), and the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). This allows seamless sharing of specimen 
resources, linked to clinical outcome data, behind a secure data management system that is available to 
SPORE investigators at all participating institutions. The protection of patient confidentiality is guarded 
throughout the whole process, from specimen collection to use in research projects. The Biostatistics and 
Bioinformatics Core is and will continue to be responsible for assisting in the data analysis, data auditing and 
quality control. 
Finally, TAPCD Core has provided and will continue to provide SPORE investigators a variety of services 
critical to successful molecular analysis of human kidney tumors as well as animal models. These services 
include: histopathologic review and quality control analysis of all tumor samples utilized in experimental 
studies; macrodissection of frozen tissue samples and slide microdissection of paraffin-embedded or frozen 
tissues to ensure high neoplastic cellularity for samples utilized in experimental studies; laser capture 
microdissection (LCM) to provide ultra-pure tumor samples; performance of routine immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) and multiparametric immunofluorescence (IF) stains on human kidney cancers (TMAs or whole tissue 
sections); optimization and validation of antibodies to known and novel proteins for use in IHC and IF; analysis 
of a broad range of IHC and multiplex IF stains using computer-assisted image analysis; development of novel 
RCC models."
10912607,"Abstract
Although aging is extremely complex, the occurrence of genetic variants in humans that positively affect longevity
and health offer an ideal starting point for the systematic identification of molecular targets for interventions that
could extend human healthspan. Through genetic analysis of the Ashkenazi Jewish centenarian resource at the
Albert Einstein College of Medicine, this U19 identified multiple rare, functional genetic variants significantly
associated with healthy longevity, which represent potential targets for drug discovery. These include coding
variants in IGF1R, SIRT6, ATM, USP35, UBE3C, and BLM, as well as functional non-coding variants in FOXO3A,
SIRT6, SMAD3, and components of the IKK/NF-kB pathway, including p65, NFKB1/p50 and NFKB1a (IkBa).
However, the mechanism by which these variant gene products extend healthspan and lifespan still need to be
discovered and validated in model systems. During the previous funding period, we used the Ercc1-/∆ mouse
model of accelerated aging and aged wild-type mice to demonstrate that reduction in ATM and NF-kB activity,
achieved by ATM and p65/RelA haploinsufficiency, and overexpression of hSIRT6 reduced cellular senescence
and extended healthspan of mice. In addition, treatment of Ercc1-/∆ mice (in collaboration with Project 4) with a
novel IKK/NF-kB inhibitor (SR12343), a known ATM inhibitor (KU-55933), and a compound shown to stimulate
the mono–adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP)–ribosyltransferase (mADPRT) activity of SIRT6 (fucoidan) reduce
senescence and improve age-related phenotypes in mice. We also generated mice carrying a centenarian rare
variant in IGF-1R (Igf1rhR407H), mice heterozygous for Smad3, Foxo3a, and Usp35, as well as mice carrying
mutations in Sirt6 conferring loss of deacetylase or mADPRT activity, which are currently being analyzed. Our
data suggests that many of these rare variants reduce DNA damage and/or cellular senescence. Here, we
propose to expand these efforts to validate the role of additional rare variants identified by Projects 1 and 2 for
their ability to extend healthspan using our murine model of a human progeroid syndrome to accelerate analyses.
We also will continue to test compounds targeting the variant gene products and associated pathways provided
by Project 4 in both progeroid and aged wild-type mice. Overall, the aim of Project 3 is to use genetic approaches
to validate the pathways identified in Projects 1 and 2 as impacting healthspan in mice. We will determine the
impact of haploinsufficiency, overexpression, or specific mutations on animal health, molecular endpoints
associated with the hallmarks of aging, resilience, and geropathology in mice. We will also pharmacologically
target these pathways in mice, in collaboration with Project 4, to determine the impact on the same endpoints.
The successful completion of this project will validate the identified human variants as important for healthy aging
and identify novel therapeutic strategies with the potential to extend healthspan."
10912611,"ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this U19 is to use genetic variation in human populations linked to extreme phenotypes of
healthy aging, centenarians and super-centenarians, to identify rare variants in genes and pathways important
for human aging to guide drug development1,2. Project 4 (old Project 3) has focused on developing therapeutics
targeting the first identified centenarian rare variants including coding variants in IGF-1R3,4, SIRT65, and ATM,
and functional non-coding variants in FOXO3A, SIRT65 and components of the IKK/NF-kB pathway, RelA/p65,
NFKB1/p50 and NFKB1a (IkBa)6. During the previous funding period, we developed a novel IKK/NF-kB inhibitor,
SR12343, first by in silico screening followed by multiple rounds of Structure Activity Relationships (SAR) using
a NF-kB-dependent reporter cell line7. SR12343 was effective in reducing senescence and inflammation and
extending healthspan in three different mouse models of aging8. We also demonstrated that a known inhibitor of
ATM, KU55933, suppressed NF-kB activity and senescence in cell culture and reduced senescence and
inflammation and extended healthspan in vivo9,10. In addition, we recently identified fucoidan, a complex sulfated
oligosaccharide from brown seaweed, as able to stimulate the mono–adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP)–
ribosyltransferase (mADPRT) activity of SIRT6, stimulate SIRT6 dependent DNA repair activity and function as
a senotherapeutic. Fucoidan treatment also reduced markers of senescence and extended healthspan in mouse
models of accelerated and natural aging. Finally, we demonstrated that a known inhibitor of SMAD3
phosphorylation, SIS3, also reduced senescence in cell culture. These results demonstrate our ability to identify
and optimize therapeutics targeting validated variants in genes and pathways identified in human centenarians.
Here we propose to expand these efforts to identify, optimize and test compounds targeting key rare variants
identified during the previous funding period, including USP35 and UBE3C important for deubiquintination and
E3 ubiquitin ligase activities respectively, BLM important for DNA repair and potentially other rare variants to be
identified and/or validated by Projects 1, 2 and 3 and Core B. In addition, we will continue to identify and optimize
compounds targeting the rare variants in the coding regions of SIRT6 and IGF-1R and the non-coding, regulatory
variants in SIRT6, SMAD3 and FOXO3A. The compounds identified targeting the rare variants will be tested for
therapeutic activity in collaboration with Project 3 in mouse models of accelerated and natural aging. The Specific
Aims of the proposal are: 1) To develop and optimize assays for screening for compounds able to mimic the
effect of the functional genetic variants and pathways identified during the previous funding period including
functional rare coding variants in IGF-1R, SIRT6, USP35, UBE3C and BLM and non-coding regulatory variants
in SMAD3, FOXO3A and SIRT6; and 2) To use the developed assays for screening for compounds able to mimic
the effect of the identified functional genetic variants and pathways."

10931410,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CORE 3
The principal objective of the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core (Core 3) is to provide project investigators a
centralized resource for biostatistics and bioinformatics expertise. Statistical issues will be addressed at all
levels of investigation: from the design of experiments to the maintenance of data quality; and from conclusions
based on formal hypothesis testing, to important leads discovered by thorough data exploration. The specific
aims of the Core are: 1.1. Collaborate with project investigators in the formulation of unambiguous
hypotheses and hypothesis testing strategies, and in the design of experiments. Biostatistics
collaboration will assist researchers at the design stage by: formulating biological and clinical questions as
testable statistical hypotheses; devising efficient experimental designs and matching these with appropriate
statistical models for both basic and high dimensional informatics data; determining sample sizes necessary to
ensure high power; and strongly controlling type I error. 1.2. Provide support for all projects with: formal
hypothesis tests in experimental and clinical data that ensure strong conclusions; exploratory
bioinformatics analyses that lead to further experiments, refined hypotheses, or discoveries; statistical
modeling and sensitivity analyses of complex data; and visual displays of data that clarify conclusions
and uncover leads. Core 3 statisticians/informaticians have worked extensively with investigators to develop
comprehensive analysis plans that distinguish between formal testing (which provides evidence for strong
conclusions) and exploratory bioinformatics analyses (which do not allow for strong conclusions but lay the
groundwork for important discoveries). Core statisticians/informaticians will employ the most robust methods
for modeling and sensitivity analyses to ensure reliability of results. For all data, visual displays will be
emphasized to reveal the reliability of conclusions and aid in the discovery of new leads. 1.3. Provide data
management and integration services that ensure high integrity, security and investigator
accessibility. Ensure statistical and informatics analysis consistency and transparency across
projects, and have a centralized repository of all analysis procedures and results. To promote data
integration across projects, Core 3 will have a centralized repository of all data that is secure and accessible to
the investigators. Data will be cleaned, merged and de-identified. All missing and outlying data will be reported
to investigators. Core 3 will ensure consistency of analysis plans and reports for the same data types across
projects. 1.4. Conduct innovative statistical and bioinformatics modeling to directly combat complex
data or design problems that arise in projects and where current methods do not apply. When faced
with specific issues that arise in these projects where current analysis methods do not apply, Core 3 personnel
will either adjust available methods or develop novel procedures to address the problems."
10916467,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Asthma, a leading chronic illness in childhood, can be life-threatening and is associated with a multitude
of adverse outcomes. Guideline-recommended medical care including the use of daily, effective inhaled
corticosteroids, has greatly improved the treatment of asthma. However, asthma remains a considerable health
concern, particularly among adolescents, who often have preventive medication adherence rates as low as 50%.
This poor adherence may not be surprising given that adolescence is a developmental period characterized by
increased autonomy including self-managing one’s health care, a skill that takes time to master. Further, stress
has been shown to negatively impact asthma health in adolescents, and this could in part be due to stress’
negative association with medication adherence. Thus, innovative approaches to improving adherence to
preventive medication and decreasing stress are needed to promote better asthma health.
 Positive Psychology is the study of positive experiences, positive individual traits, and supportive social
networks. Positive affect (e.g., emotions such as happiness) is a major component in Positive Psychology and
has been demonstrated in multiple peer reviewed studies to boost health in several conditions. Evidence
suggests that the health enhancing effects of positive affect occur through its beneficial impact on health
behaviors (such as medication adherence) and stress. Given the role of medication adherence and stress in
asthma health, we expect that positive affect will benefit asthma health by increasing medication adherence and
decreasing stress, as well as have direct effects on asthma health.
 That said, positive affect, adherence, stress, and asthma health are all dynamic in nature changing from
moment to moment, but the momentary effects of and interactions among these factors have not been studied
together in prior asthma literature. Testing these associations at the momentary level may help uncover nuanced
relationships informing behavioral interventions that can be adaptive over time to fit not only the person but the
occasion (i.e., what is happening in that moment), thus increasing intervention effectiveness for the management
of asthma.
 Thus, the present proposal will test the associations between momentary-positive-affect and asthma
health, as well as the hypothesized mechanisms behind this association, using a longitudinal burst design with
momentary assessment of adolescents with moderate to severe persistent asthma. The work in this application
lays the foundation for the development of adaptive behavioral interventions to better treat asthma in
adolescents."

The goal of the SPORE in Pancreatic Cancer Developmental Research Program (DRP) is to recruit and support
developmental research projects in pancreatic cancer for future incorporation as full SPORE projects or as the
basis for applications for other nationally competitive peer-reviewed funding. The types of pancreatic cancer
research projects that will be supported include basic, translational, clinical, epidemiologic, and cancer
prevention. Projects supported under the DRP will expand the scope of translational research and increase the
number of investigators committed to pancreatic cancer research. The DRP is open to institutions participating
in the SPORE (WUSM, UPenn) and any of their collaborators. The DRP will work in tandem with the Career
Enhancement Program (CEP) to assist in developing junior investigators and recruiting/mentoring minority
investigators. These objectives will be accomplished by performing four specific aims.
Aim 1: Support the development of pancreatic cancer research projects for future incorporation as full
SPORE projects or for new independent peer-reviewed funding. The DRP will solicit new research projects
annually. In addition to NCI funds, a total of $375,000 in institutional support has been committed in support of
the DRP. DRP awards will provide up to $75,000 for 1 year, with a competitive renewal allowed for a second
year of funding. Two to three awards per year are anticipated. Institutional funds will make the NCI funds
($25,000/year) committed to underrepresented minorities equivalent to other DRP awards.
Aim 2: Foster collaborations between basic and clinical researchers. The DRP directors will facilitate
interactions between basic and clinical researchers through shared weekly meetings, the annual SPORE retreat,
and small group meetings.
Aim 3: Mentor junior faculty and new faculty involved in pancreatic cancer research. All investigators
submitting applications to the DRP will receive a written scientific and statistical review, and the DRP directors
will be available to discuss the projects in detail. Where appropriate, mentors will be identified to work with junior
faculty or collaborate with faculty whose primary research area is outside of pancreatic cancer. All DRP awardees
will present their research progress to the SPORE steering committee twice per year.
Aim 4: Promote the participation of women, minorities, and disabled investigators in pancreatic cancer
research and facilitate the recruitment of minorities into clinical pancreatic cancer trials. The DRP
directors will implement initiatives that enhance the participation of women, minorities, and disabled persons in
SPORE clinical trials and promote the participation of diverse groups in pancreatic cancer research.
Impact: The proposed work will improve our understanding of pancreatic cancer biology and will identify new
strategies for early detection, prevention, imaging, and treatment for this refractory malignancy."
10916371,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The SPORE in Pancreatic Cancer Career Enhancement Program (CEP) aims to recruit and support new
independent investigators in translational pancreatic cancer research. Along with the Developmental Research
Program (DRP), the CEP will provide financial support, didactic training, and mentored research opportunities to
prepare investigators for independent careers in translational pancreatic cancer research. The CEP will extend
current efforts to promote diversity in pancreatic cancer research through recruitment of women, minority, and
disabled faculty. We propose the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: Recruit and support new investigators in translational pancreatic cancer research. In
addition to the NCI funds, a total of $323,000 in institutional support is committed in support of the CEP program.
CEP awards will provide $75K per year for 2 years. Awardees will be junior faculty beginning their research
careers or transitioning into translational pancreatic cancer research. Funded initiatives are expected to have a
major translational component and focus on pancreatic cancer etiology, prevention, diagnosis, early detection,
treatment, or population science.
Specific Aim 2: Train and mentor junior faculty in translational pancreatic cancer research. All CEP
awardees will be mentored by both a senior basic science and clinical mentor and will craft an individualized
career development plan that includes didactic coursework, patient care, and career skills training. We will
leverage institutional educational opportunities to include courses in clinical trial design, biostatistics, and ethics.
The SPORE CEP Steering Committee will track and evaluate CEP awardees’ research and career development.
Specific Aim 3: Foster inter-SPORE collaborations. An educational exchange with our peer Pancreatic or GI
SPORE institutions (University of Nebraska, Mayo Clinic, John Hopkins, University of North Carolina, University
of California System) allows CEP awardees to present their research, receive expert feedback, meet peer
SPORE leadership, and develop collaborations. Content experts from peer SPORE institutions will perform
critical reviews and provide formal feedback for CEP awardees’ extramural grant applications.
Specific Aim 4: Promote participation of women, minority, and disabled investigators in pancreatic
cancer research. Diversity Advisor Bettina Drake, PhD, MPH will guide recruitment, training, and retention of
women, minority, and disabled investigators in pancreatic cancer research at all training levels. We have also

STEM CELL AND CANCER BIOLOGY PROGRAM - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overarching goal of the Stem Cell and Cancer Biology (SCCB) Program is to provide fundamental insights
into the basic cell and molecular mechanisms facilitating cancer evolution, progression and therapy resistance
which enable the identification of novel anti-cancer strategies. To achieve this mission, the Program has three
specific aims, which are to: (1) discover mechanisms underlying the evolution of malignant cancer (stem) cells;
(2) delineate drivers of cancer progression and therapy resistance; and (3) characterize the principal
mechanisms establishing and governing cellular differentiation and identity. The strategy for successfully
carrying out this mission requires the involvement of basic, preclinical, and clinical/translational research. The
SCCB Program critically relies on a diverse and broad spectrum of scientific expertise encompassing highly
focused molecular and cell physiological mechanisms, and is substantiated through various model organisms
and platforms. It also relies upon collaborations with other MECC research programs, including the Cancer
Therapeutics Program for clinical translation of new discoveries by SCCB members that have translational
applications. Centralized MECC support, particularly Shared Resources, such as (but not limited to) the Animal
Model Shared Resource, Biostatistics Shared Resource, Genomics Shared Resource, Analytical Imaging
Facility, Flow Cytometry Shared Resource, and Cancer Biorepository Shared Resource, greatly facilitates,
streamlines, and enhances SCCB research.

SHARED RESOURCE MANAGEMENT - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Montefiore Einstein Cancer Center (MECC) Shared Resources (SRs) support the entire range of cancer-
focused basic, clinical, translational, and population sciences and provide access to MECC members to state-
of-the-art methodology and instrumentation, high-level expertise and instruction, and cost-effective sources of
research support. MECC SRs are closely aligned with the scientific strategic priorities of the MECC. They greatly
facilitate research investigating cancer biology at the molecular, cellular and organismic level, including the
biology and signaling that are directly relevant to the unique Bronx patient population served by MECC;
development and evaluation of new cancer therapeutics; and identification of genetic, epidemiological,
behavioral, and social determinants of health causality in our diverse catchment area population. Additional SRs
promote the acquisition, storage, and analysis of patient sample and the management and coordination of clinical
trials within the MECC catchment area for ongoing cancer-focused research. MECC SRs are managed at
multiple levels to ensure a high quality of services, responsiveness to MECC members, and alignment with the
MECC Strategic Plan. Management tools and strategies include input to the SR directors from expert User
Advisory Committees and survey data from MECC membership; monitoring of SR performance by the Shared
Resource Oversight Committee (SROC), which is chaired by the Associate Director for SR; monthly Research
Leadership Council (RLC) meetings with all MECC SR Directors and Program Leaders; meetings with the
Excellence in Career Enrichment Leadership (ExCEL) Committee, composed of junior and mid-level faculty
members; and direct reporting by the Associate Director for SR to the Senior Leadership Team of the MECC.
MECC SRs are managed in partnership with the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (Einstein) such that MECC
contributions are used to leverage substantial institutional support. As such, oversight of SR finances is
conducted on a quarterly basis by the Associate Director for SR and the Deputy Director for Administration, in
collaboration with senior administrative officials from the Dean’s office. Leveraging Einstein support has greatly

10821383,"Project Summary
 Brain metastases arise later than metastases at other sites. Once they do, they are rapidly debilitating and
lethal. The time it takes for brain metastases to emerge suggests that a dormancy phase is involved. This
notion is supported by clinical and experimental data. Indeed, our own preliminary data show that breast
cancer cells become dormant upon entering the brain, and that emerging from this state is the rate-limiting step
of metastasis. These data indicate that targeting dormant disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) is a logical
approach to brain metastasis prevention. However, despite a growing understanding of dormancy mechanisms
in common metastatic sites like lung and bone marrow, a parallel understanding of how DTCs are driven into a
dormant state in brain has not developed. The overarching goal of this proposal is to address this issue. We
will formulate a basic framework for how the brain microenvironment drives DTCs into a dormant state, with
support from clinical specimens, so that we can leverage this understanding for therapies that keep DTCs
dormant indefinitely.
 Our recent investigations have revealed that dormant DTCs occupy the brain’s vascular niche, where
perivascular astrocytes suppress their outgrowth. We suspect that astrocytic contributions to the parenchymal
basement membrane are responsible for DTC suppression, and that these contributions converge on a
common receptor: dystroglycan. Therefore, our hypotheses are that: (i) astrocytic basement membrane is a
key driver of DTC dormancy, and (ii) dystroglycan function must remain intact for DTCs to interpret these
signals. We will test these hypotheses through two specific aims:
 Aim 1. Determine whether astrocytic basement membrane promotes and sustains DTC dormancy.
 Aim 2. Elucidate the dystroglycan-mediated signaling axis that effects DTC quiescence in brain.
 We have brought every relevant resource to bear in order to address these aims. These resources span: (i)
long-term intravital imaging to determine the fate of DTCs following ablation of DTC-associated astrocytes; (ii)
transgenic mice to measure the outcome of ablating astrocyte derived basement membrane molecules on DTC
fate; (iii) rare clinical specimens to establish whether astrocytes and astrocytic basement membrane are asso-
ciated with dormant DTCs in humans; and (iv) a host of mutant, over- and under- expression constructs to
solve how dystroglycan functions from the outside-in to drive DTC quiescence.
 The significance and innovation of this work lie in the identification of the first dormancy drivers in brain,
ultimately to unravel dystroglycan-driven signaling that effects disseminated breast tumor cell quiescence. This
work will set the stage for agonists of dystroglycan function that serve as prophylactics for brain metastasis
prevention."
10831097,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells are tumor-tropic cell-based therapies that are being investigated as a
novel immunotherapy treatment for glioblastoma (GBM). Early clinical findings are highly encouraging, with
established safety and demonstrated antitumor activity, and have shown complete regression in at least one
patient. However, the effects of CAR T therapies are not uniform across GBM patients, and we have limited
knowledge about what may predict efficacy prior to treatment. Identification of predictive biomarkers and
approaches to optimize therapy could benefit patients and increase efficacy, yet much is still unknown in regards
to their transport and delivery within solid tumors and resection cavities. In GBM, as the tumor grows, there is
heightened interstitial fluid flow (IFF) from the tumor into the surrounding parenchyma through the extracellular
matrix, interacting with invading cells and surrounding glia. Therapies that increase bulk fluid flow such as
infusion of CAR T-cells will also increase IFF through the extracellular spaces of the brain. Thus, throughout
tumor progression and during therapeutic intervention, the brain tissue is exposed to heightened IFF. IFF has
been linked to altered cell invasion. In peripheral tissues, increased interstitial fluid flow due to injury or infection
triggers trafficking of activated dendritic cells to draining lymph nodes, and is necessary to mount an appropriate
immune response. These effects are poorly studied in the brain but are critical to understanding how T-cells
move both during tumor growth and therapy. T-cells are particularly responsive to fluid shear stress, however,
the role of IFF on T-cell motility is unknown. Non-invasive imaging of interstitial fluid flow via MRI in brain tumors
could help clinicians predict patterns of T-cell localization during and after therapy. We therefore propose to
combine MRI techniques to measure IFF with predictive modeling. Our goal is to characterize barriers to optimal
CAR T-cell administration, and to identify imaging biomarkers for evaluation and prediction of clinical response
to CAR T-cell therapies for glioblastoma. We hypothesize that the effectiveness of CAR T-cell therapy depends
critically on fluid dynamics in the brain and in the tumor, which are patient-specific. This hypothesis leads us to
the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Identify the impact of interstitial fluid flow on T-cell migration and
efficacy in the brain tumor microenvironment. Specific Aim 2. Modulate clinically-relevant CAR T-cell delivery
strategies that depend on IFF to increase therapeutic effect. Specific Aim 3. Build predictive mathematical
models to study CAR T-cell trafficking and distribution within the tumor based on IFF and tissue structure. Impact
and deliverables. The impact of this work is to advance our understanding of factors, which influence the
efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy in the brain, with potential implications for other solid tumors. If successful, we will
establish both readily implementable strategies to leverage IFF in CAR T-cell therapy and IFF as a potential
biomarker of response to CAR T-cell therapy in brain tumors, which can be evaluated non-invasively prior to
treatment, followed longitudinally in vivo, and easily incorporated into ongoing and future clinical trial designs."

A recent study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed a pressing health crisis for the
United States: the number of reported cases of tick-borne diseases has increased significantly during the past
two decades. Importantly, the reported annual incidence captures only a small fraction of the real number of
individuals infected with tick-borne pathogens. The broad spectrum of clinically important tick-borne diseases
includes Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, tularemia, babesiosis, and Spotted Fever rickettsiosis.
Spotted Fever group rickettsiae include R. rickettsii (Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, RMSF), R. conorii
(Mediterranean Spotted Fever), and R. parkeri (Rickettsia parkeri rickettsiosis) as well as many newly
discovered Rickettsia species with unknown pathogenicity. Doxycycline is considered as the antibiotic of
choice for the treatment of tick-borne rickettsiosis; however, delay in diagnosis and antibiotic treatment can
lead to severe disease and death. The search for long-term immune protection against invasive rickettsial
diseases (RMSF and epidemic typhus caused by R. prowazekii) has been a goal since the discovery of the
causative microorganisms by Dr. Howard T. Ricketts. However, whole cell live-attenuated or formalin/phenol-
inactivated vaccines generate limited protective immune responses in humans and, because of safety
concerns, are no longer considered for rickettsial vaccine development. We have developed kkaebi transposon
mutagenesis technology and studied the genetic requirements of the rickettsial intracellular life-cycle (bacterial
attachment to and invasion into host cells, escape from endo-lysosome, intracellular replication, and release
from host cells). This work determined that the polysaccharide synthesis operon (pso) is responsible for O-
antigen biosynthesis, contributes to pathogenesis, and is essential for the development of bactericidal Weil–
Felix antibodies. Immunization with carbohydrate conjugate vaccines, including the capsular polysaccharide or
the O-antigen of lipopolysaccharide, generated serotype-specific protective immunity that correlated with the
induction of bactericidal antibodies. This proposal aims to understand the adaptive immune responses to
invasive rickettsial infections and to determine the contribution of rickettsial O-antigen conjugate vaccine and
Weil–Felix antibodies toward protective immunity against tick-borne rickettsial infections.

HIV and food insecurity pose severe and interrelated problems in Latin America and the Caribbean, including
in the Dominican Republic (DR), where HIV ranks as one of the top 5 causes of death and our prior studies
have found that nearly 70% of people with HIV (PWH) have moderate or severe food insecurity. Despite the
established, detrimental role of food insecurity on poor HIV treatment outcomes, evidence on sustainable
interventions that address the cycle of food insecurity and poor HIV health is scarce. To address this gap, we
developed and piloted ProMeSA (through an R34 grant), an integrated urban gardens and peer nutritional
counseling intervention, and found it feasible, acceptable, and with preliminary efficacy at 6 and 12 months of
improving food security and HIV virologic suppression. The purpose of this five-year study is to conduct a fully-
powered cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of ProMeSA to assess intervention efficacy evaluated over a
longer period (18 months) as well as mediators and barriers and facilitators to intervention uptake,
implementation, and sustainability. The specific aims are: (1) Determine the efficacy of an integrated urban
gardens and peer nutritional counseling intervention on the primary outcome of HIV viral suppression
[undetectable HIV viral load (VL)] and secondary outcomes of ART adherence and HIV care retention care
among people with food insecurity across diverse regions in the DR; (2) Examine the intervention effects on
intermediate outcomes posited to mediate the impact of ProMeSA on ART adherence, care retention, and viral
suppression; (3) Evaluate process-related factors associated with intervention uptake and implementation
(facilitators, barriers, fidelity, and replication costs) to inform future scale-up. The trial will include 20 HIV clinics
randomized to intervention or usual care control (n=25 per clinic; 500 total study participants). VL and other
key outcomes will be assessed at baseline, and 6-, 12- and 18-months. Following our intervention causal
framework and pilot findings, we hypothesize that ProMeSA will improve food security and diet quality and
reduce stigma and competing needs, which in turn will improve HIV clinical outcomes. The predominant causal
paths identified will inform tailoring ProMeSA to enhance impact in future dissemination and implementation. In
addition, we will collect extensive quantitative and qualitative data on intervention implementation and
participant experiences with the intervention across diverse settings and participants to inform scale-up. The
study involves a partnership among researchers from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, University of
California, San Francisco, RAND, and the Universidad Autonóma de Santo Domingo as well as the Dominican
Ministries of Agriculture and Public Health, the Dominican National HIV/AIDS Council, and the United Nations
World Food Program. To our knowledge, this will be the first full-scale trial to integrate nutritional counseling
with food-generating activities among PWH with food insecurity, in support of national and international goals
to achieve viral suppression and reduce the disease- and economic burden of HIV."

Research (SBIR) application to expand and fully evaluate Guardians Receiving Information

course to prepare community health workers (CHWs) to provide oral health outreach to low-
income Black parents/guardians (henceforth guardians) of children and adolescents. GRIN
seeks to increase CHWs’ knowledge, attitudes and beliefs, perceived self-efficacy, and intentions
to conduct oral health outreach to Black guardians.
 The need for GRIN is great. Tooth decay, especially when untreated, creates lasting and
substantial physical and psychosocial consequences for children and adolescents. Minority and
low-income populations have disproportionately high rates of tooth decay and related
consequences. Compared to non-Hispanic White children, Black children are less likely to
receive preventive dental visits, and experience more untreated tooth decay. Moreover, children
living in poverty are twice as likely as children not living in poverty to experience primary tooth
decay. To address these needs and meet calls to action for evidence-based programs to support
CHWs to conduct oral health outreach to Black guardians of children and adolescents, KDHRC
developed GRIN. Our Phase I efforts yielded a prototype with supportive feasibility results and
solid partnerships on which we base our Phase II approach. Indeed, CHW professional
organizations, including the National Maternal and Child Oral Health Resource Center, the
National AHEC Organization (NAO), and Morehouse School of Medicine, commit to the
scientific execution and commercial distribution of this project and substantiate GRIN’s
programmatic importance and commercial potential.
 In Phase II, we will develop additional interactive content, film video vignettes, and finalize
GRIN. Then, we will conduct a well-powered and methodologically strong two-condition
randomized controlled trial to test GRIN’s effectiveness. Our market research suggests a
significant need and eager market, and support from myriad stakeholders committed to GRIN’s

10805503,"Project Summary/Abstract
Tuberculosis (TB), caused by infection with the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a leading cause
of mortality due to infection, globally. In 2020, 10 million people were newly diagnosed with TB and 1.5 million
people died from the disease. As efforts to treat TB expand, the prevalence of infections caused by drug-resistant
Mtb
strains (DR-TB) that are resistant to one or more frontline standard of care (SoC) antibiotics is increasing,
in part due to the long duration (6 months) of combination therapy (4 antibiotics) for drug-sensitive TB (DS-TB),
which leads to poor patient adherence. Treatment for DR-TB is even longer, ranging from 6-24 months typically,
with 3, 4 or more antibiotics taken in combination. While the last decade has seen a TB drug development
“renaissance,” including the discovery of bedaquiline, newly approved regimens still suffer from serious side
effects and can be cost prohibitive. Therefore, new classes of drugs with new MoAs that can be combined with
existing or new TB drugs in the pipeline are desperately needed. The success of bedaquiline, which disrupts
energy metabolism in Mtb and has shown promise in reducing treatment times for DR-TB, has accompanied an
explosion of drug discovery targeting respiration in Mtb. In this application, Fimbrion proposes to develop a
thiazolino-pyridone (TZP) small molecule series with growth inhibitory activity against Mtb as a novel drug for
treating TB. While the target of this compound series is currently unknown, TZPs appear to act through disruption
of Mtb respiration. Interestingly, current TZPs not only have direct antimycobacterial activity, but they can also
potentiate the activity of isoniazid (INH), an important frontline TB antibiotic, even restoring INH activity against
INH-resistant Mtb in vitro. Our primary goal in this project is to develop a first-in-class, orally bioavailable,
antimycobacterial TZP compound that could become part of a new frontline TB drug regimen to help shorten the
duration of treatment. Currently, our most potent TZP compounds have sub-micromolar growth inhibition potency
in vitro, and favorable drug-like properties. Therefore, our primary Phase I goal will be to improve growth inhibition
potency while maintaining and/or improving the drug-like properties of the lead compounds to enable testing of
optimized compounds in an animal model of Mtb infection. Specifically, we will 1) use medicinal chemistry drug
design strategies to improve in vitro potency, metabolic stability, and solubility, and will establish in vivo
pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles (including oral bioavailability) for optimized TZPs in mice; and 2) investigate the in
vitro and in vivo efficacy of prioritized lead TZPs and generate spontaneous mutants resistant to these
compounds to better understand the bacterial target and MoA. As we have found that the antimycobacterial
potency of our TZPs tracks with their ability to potentiate INH, we will continue to spot-check this secondary
property throughout the optimization of our TZPs. Upon completion of this project, we expect to identify an
advanced lead TZP compound with demonstrated efficacy in a mouse model of acute TB, which could be further
developed in a future Phase II SBIR project as part of a combination therapy for treating both DS- and DR-TB."

10897927,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The goal of our studies is to generate robust and long-lasting tumor-specific T cell responses for durable
tumor regression in patients with chemotherapy-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC).
Although immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), adoptive T cell therapy (ACT), or oncolytic
viruses (OV) have generated remarkable results in several tumor types (e.g. melanoma, NSCLC), long-term
tumor control has been infrequent in patients with HGSOC. Studies by our group and others have identified
key stumbling blocks underpinning the limited anti-tumor efficacy of immunotherapy in EOC. These include: (i)
insufficient expansion of tumor antigen-specific T cells, (ii) recruitment of Tregs and myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (MDSC) via tumor CXCL12 production, (iii) severe dysfunction of tumor-infiltrating T
lymphocytes (TIL) often by PD1 upregulation, (iv) low intrinsic tumor immunogenicity partially dependent on
reduced tumor mutation burden and IFNβ production, (viii) insufficient recruitment of intratumoral dendritic cell
populations (DC) capable of cross-presenting tumor antigens; (ix) tumor “vascular checkpoint” characterized by
disorganized and tortuous tumor vasculature lacking adequate flow dynamics to support trafficking of anti-
tumor T cells. While combinatorial immunotherapy strategies have the potential to overcome these immune
resistance mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment (TME), they are often associated with unacceptably
high rates of toxicities in patients. Our proposal addresses these stumbling blocks using innovative, clinically-
translatable strategies to reprogram the TME and to identify mechanisms that drive or hinder T cell trafficking
into ovarian tumors.
 We previously demonstrated blockade of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in the ovarian TME by intraperitoneal
delivery of an oncolytic vaccinia virus expressing a CXCR4 antagonist (OVV-CXCR4-A-Fc) reduced
intratumoral accumulation of immunosuppressive mediators, stimulated spontaneous anti-tumor immunity to
endogenous tumor antigens, and improved T cell trafficking into the TME. Based on our observations, we
propose to test the hypothesis that in HGSOC patients receiving liposomal doxorubicin (DOX) for platinum
resistant/refractory EOC, in vivo tumor destruction by OVV-CXCR4-A-Fc will (i) abrogate tumor immune
suppression, (ii) promote trafficking and accumulation of tumor-specific T cells, and (iii) when combined with
PDL1 blockade, will limit T exhaustion and provide clinical benefit in a phase I/II clinical trial. The approach is
to first determine whether i.p. OVV-CXCR4-A-Fc is safe and triggers a transformation of the ovarian TME from
tolerogenic to immunogenic in a first-in-human clinical trial focused on patients with platinum
resistant/refractory EOC. Second, we will determine whether the combination of OVV-CXCR4-A-Fc and PDL1
inhibition is safe and can generate clinical efficacy. Third, we will test whether the combinatorial regimen
generates functionally distinct CD8+ and CD4+ effector/memory cells for shared antigens and neoantigens.
Finally, we plan to uncover the molecular mechanisms by which OVV-CXCR4-A-Fc overcomes the ovarian
tumor “vascular checkpoint” to enhance T cell migration and trafficking."
10897931,"ABSTRACT: Despite increasing efficacy for standard of care of ovarian cancer (OvCa), the overall five-year
survival of OvCa patients is only 47.6%. Polyclonal T cell responses against multiple cancer- and patient-
specific antigens are the key element of effective cancer immunity and resulting outcomes.
Project 3 develops and tests a new immunization strategy to enhance the induction of cytotoxic lymphocytes
(CTLs) against multiple patient-specific epitopes, by targeting cancer cells, endogenous dendritic cells (DCs)
and ex vivo generated DCs. We will compare the immunopeptidomes on OvCa cells and two populations of
DC specialized in CTL induction: ex-vivo generated alpha-type-1-polarized (αDC1s) and endogenous
conventional DCs (cDC1s) which share the inflammatory BATF3/IRF8 phenotype and elevated ability to
cross-present multiple cancer-cell-associated antigens to CD8+ T cells.
Combining our unique in vitro sensitization (IVS) and bioinformatics approaches, we will test the overall
hypothesis that the mismatch between immunopeptidomes of OvCa cells and DCs presenting antigens
from cancer cells limits the therapeutic effectiveness of spontaneous and vaccination-induced CTL
responses. We further hypothesize that αDC1s loaded with synthetic patient-specific neoantigen peptides
will bypass such mismatch, inducing CTLs particularly effective in killing OvCa tumors. We propose the
following three Aims:
Specific Aim 1: Compare the antigenic specificity of human CD8+ T cells induced by DCs loaded with
autologous OvCa cells, tumor-eluted peptides and patient-specific neoantigen peptides identified by
in-silico approaches. We hypothesize that CTLs induced by autologous cancer cell-loaded DC1s or
cDC1s contain large number of CTLs which are irrelevant for tumor recognition, which deficit can be
corrected by loading DCs with synthetic neoantigen peptides specific to each patient's OvCa cells.
Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the immunopeptidome differences between OvCa cells and tumor-loaded
αDC1s and endogenous cDC1s and test the feasibility of their adjustment. We hypothesize that
immune adjuvants and inflammatory mediators can be used to modulate APM patterns and
immunopeptidomes of DCs and OvCa cells, to enhance the antigenic match between arising CTLs and
autologous OvCa cells.
Specific Aim 3: Determine the feasibility, safety and clinical efficacy of αDC1 vaccines loaded with
patient-specific neoantigen peptides combined with PD-1 blockade. Each patient will receive 8 courses
of DC1 vaccines loaded with patient-specific neoantigens and pembrolizumab. Guided by the results of Aim
2, the patients may also receive systemic immune modulation to increase the visibility of their own OvCa
cells to DC1-induced CTLs and reduce immune suppression. Clinical efficacy will be monitored by iORR.
Predicted Impact: Results of Project 3 will be translated into development of novel therapeutic vaccines and
prospectively into new modes of immune checkpoint inhibition and adoptive T cell therapies."

The Developmental Research Program of the Roswell Park Ovarian Cancer SPORE is a platform to support
innovative, potentially high-risk/high-reward, investigator-initiated projects with the potential for maturation into
translational ovarian cancer research projects that will transition basic and/or population research findings into
research focused on human clinical specimens/patient populations. Furthermore, the funds of the Developmental
Research Program will be leveraged by encouraging the development of the pilot projects into collaborative,
multi-investigator, multi-institutional translational research programs, or as new Individual Research Projects of
the Roswell Park Ovarian Cancer SPORE. Therefore, the Developmental Research Program projects are the
ultimate measure of the success of a SPORE and form the base for future translational ovarian cancer research
at the individual institutions, as they are springboards for the next generation of R01, P01, Consortium, and
SPORE grants. The goals of the proposal review process are not only to identify the most exciting projects, but
to provide constructive critiques that are of value both for future submission of the projects to extramural funding
sources, and for identifying potential collaborators and resources within the Roswell Park Ovarian Cancer
SPORE to increase the competitiveness of future applications. Proposals from faculty with established ovarian
cancer research programs, or faculty interested in transitioning to translational ovarian cancer research, will be
evaluated by a study section identified by the Executive Committee for scientific merit, with recommendations
for funding referred to the Internal Advisory Board for award. The unique strengths of the Developmental
Research Program lie in its ability to provide significant financial support in a timely manner to high-risk/pilot
projects to develop critical preliminary data, provide a flexible mechanism that can respond rapidly to new
initiatives or exciting findings through a formal application procedure using the Executive Committee and Internal
Advisory Board, or receive even quicker but lesser funds through an ad hoc award from the Discretionary Fund
of the Roswell Park Ovarian Cancer SPORE Principal Investigators."

Predictive Markers and Mechanisms of Persistent Psychotic-like Experiences in Children: An Adolescent
Brain and Cognitive Development Study Analysis
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
My long-term career goal is to establish a highly influential and independent research program and become a
broad spectrum leader and innovator in computational psychiatry. I therefore propose the following training goals:
1) To gain formalized training in computational psychiatry methods and statistics, including deep
learning and structural equation modeling, 2) to obtain a deeper understanding of the field of
developmental psychopathology, and 3) to acquire training in developing and sustaining an independent
investigator position with his own laboratory. To meet the first goal, I will meet regularly with University of
California Davis (UCD) faculty co-mentors Ian Davidson and Emilio Ferrer, attend relevant UCD classes, and
complete a Research Plan with the following Specific Aims: 1) Using deep learning from Adolescent Brain and
Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study data (demographic/clinical information, neurocognitive testing,
neuroimaging data, and environmental metrics), predict child psychotic-like experience (PLE) distress scores
the following year (i.e., baseline data predicting year one PQ-BC distress, year one data predicting year two
distress, etc.), and 2) Using rules-based guidance from deep learning using explainable AI (XAI) algorithms, use
sequential, structural equation modeling (SEM) of latent profiles (i.e., longitudinal trajectories, e.g., emerging,
absent, remitting, persistent) to test hypotheses regarding the longitudinal mechanism(s) which may lead to
persistent PLEs in the ABCD cohort. In Aim 1, XAI methods will be used identify the rules used by the deep
learner to make decisions; in Aim 2, these rules will then be used to create latent constructs for modeling profiles
of longitudinal trajectories. If r2>0.80 is consistently achieved for each iterative analysis in Aim 1, it suggests that
ABCD instruments may predict PLE severity one year after measurement at a potentially clinically implementable
level and help generate future hypotheses for personalized interventions aimed at reducing risk for persistent
PLE distress. For Aim 2, insight will be gained with regard to how brain structure, brain function, neurocognitive
ability, and environmental influences interact to influence the time course of PLE expression. To meet the
second goal, I will receive mentoring including guided readings via monthly meetings with co-mentor Dr. Ellen
Leibenluft, a world-renowned psychiatrist specializing in developmental research and Section Chief at the NIMH.
I will also attend developmental classes, seminars, and workshops offered by UCD. To meet the third goal, I
will attend weekly meetings with mentor Dr. Cameron Carter, from whom I will gain overarching career guidance.
This will include learning how to create and oversee a laboratory, obtaining recommendations for society
memberships, acquiring networking opportunities, securing grant sponsorships, and receiving RCR-related
guidance. I will also attend mentoring and grantsmanship workshops offered by UCD, attend an off-campus
workshop providing hands-on activities to provide exposure to fundamental management skills, complete a
formalized UCD RCR plan, and gain mentoring experience by advising a research assistant and postdoc."
10890789,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Individuals who have disabilities and health impairments frequently have typically developing (TD)
siblings who share high levels of involvement throughout their lifespan. Increasingly, siblings are being
recognized by parents, government, and disability service providers as the next generation of caregivers for
people with disabilities, yet the risks and stressors they experience and their needs for attentive parenting and
support are frequently overlooked. While a small number of effective programs and an emerging body of
research informs best practices to address the behavioral health needs of siblings across the lifespan, minority
and rural siblings face significant barriers to accessing these programs. Our team of researchers, developers,
and Sibling Support Project consultants propose to build and evaluate a bilingual assistive mobile app
technology for families with sibling children (ages 3-6) that delivers engaging and interactive support for TD
siblings’ social-emotional health and well-being. Age- and culturally inclusive multimedia content and
interactive behavioral skill-building features will allow families to easily access and engage in the program at
the time and place that best meets their needs. In Phase I, we developed and pilot tested an English/Spanish-
language prototype of the SIBTime mobile app/web program, with six modules on establishing parent/child
connection routines. Each 10-minute learning experience included animated stories; narrated reflection
questions; brief guided audio exercise for parents/caregivers; and graphic charts to prompt and reinforce
connection routines. Phase I pilot study results showed the modest 5-week intervention was associated with
statistically significant medium-large effects on parenting nurturance and parental adjustment with regard to
their TD child. Results also showed medium-large increases from pretest to posttest in the frequency of
parents’ engagement in and self-efficacy for targeted parenting practices with the TD child. This included
increased frequency of one-to-one involvement and of listening, talking, and helping their TD child learn about
the disability, and increased self-efficacy for these practices as well as for thinking through considerations for
parenting their TD child and providing the child positive attention and affection. Parents’ ratings of usability
and satisfaction with SIBTime were also high. In Phase II, we aim to complete development and test the full-
scale dual-language SIBTime program in an RCT evaluation with a sufficiently powered sample size (N = 160
families). The complete program will include 12 modules that address common concerns among young
siblings (3-6 years), provide age-appropriate information on high-incidence disabilities, and provide parents
with tools for healthy family functioning. In response to parent feedback, the tool’s interactivity will be
further developed, with activities that help children learn and practice language for talking about disability
and sibling concerns. We will test the efficacy of SIBtime in improving parent-child relationships, parent and
child adjustment, and parents’ engagement in and self-efficacy for the targeted parenting practices."
10837901,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
 A resurgent stimulant epidemic among sexual minority men/men who have sex with men, including those
living with HIV, could compromise the U.S. Ending the HIV Epidemic goals by interfering with HIV care
engagement, adherence, and virologic suppression among sexual minority men living with HIV. Prominent
multi-level barriers interfere with HIV virologic suppression among sexual minority men living with HIV,
particularly among those who use stimulants.
 We will digitally recruit at least 1,000 sexual minority men living with HIV, of whom at least 40% will identify
as Black/African-American and at least 70% will have active stimulant use to identify multi-level determinants
of HIV care engagement, adherence, and virologic suppression among sexual minority men living with HIV,
with and without stimulant use. Guided by the social ecological model, we will investigate network factors (HIV
status, stimulant use), geospatial determinants (background stimulant use prevalence, EHE region), and other
structural factors (intersectional stigma, structural racism) that affect virologic suppression (Aim 1). After
recruitment milestones are met, we will perform a nested randomized clinical trial to test a multi-component
intervention to improve virologic suppression, adherence, positive affect, and stimulant use among sexual
minority men living with HIV who use stimulants (n=300). The intervention, known as reSTART, will combine
an evidence-based positive affect intervention delivered through a smartphone app and use of urine point-of-
care testing to perform adherence self-monitoring, with motivational messages to improve or maintain
adherence delivered via the reSTART app (Aim 2). In Aim 3 of the proposal, we will assess the impact of
reSTART on incremental cost per person on virologic suppression and optimal antiretroviral therapy adherence
measured via hair tenofovir levels.
 By this high-impact study’s end, we will have identified multi-level determinants of the treatment continuum
among digitally-recruited sexual minority men living with HIV, including among those who use stimulants; and
the impact of a multi-component reSTART mHealth intervention using novel point-of-care adherence self-
monitoring on HIV virologic suppression, adherence, and cost among a key underserved population."
10995537,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over 4 million births occur in the United States each year, and opioid prescribing for acute pain during
pregnancy and childbirth is common and highly variable. Guidelines to direct opioid prescribing during
pregnancy and birth are sparse, leading to excessive prescribing and increasing the risk of opioid overdose,
addiction, diversion, and persistent opioid use. In this 3 year study, we will create evidence-based, patient-
centered guidelines to support acute postoperative pain management for pregnant individuals during childbirth
and surgery. We will examine the effectiveness of implementing these guidelines on clinical and patient-
reported outcomes in a large, state-wide consortium of 68 hospitals within the Collaborative Quality
Improvement programs in Michigan. We will convene a national panel of patients, providers, reproductive
justice advocates, health equity experts, and health system leaders to guide all activities. First, we will use the
RAND/UCLA Appropriateness methodology to merge a systematic literature review with expert opinion to
create provider- and patient-facing guidelines that direct opioid prescribing, integrate opioid-alternatives and
considerations for unique populations (high-risk pregnancies, comorbid conditions, prior opioid exposure,
opioid and substance use disorders), and include best practices to promote health equity and patient-
centeredness (Phase 1). We will create tailored strategies for CPG dissemination and implementation using
state of the art techniques in implementation science at the national and facility level (Phase 2). Finally, we will
conduct an enhanced, non-responder randomized trial across 68 hospitals in Michigan to determine the
effectiveness of CPGs that inform opioid prescribing during peripartum care as well as the impact of innovative,
adaptive implementation interventions at the hospital level (Phase 3). Our primary outcomes will include the
rate and amount of opioid prescribed among pregnant individuals during surgery and childbirth. We will also
examine patient-reported outcomes (e.g., postoperative pain, opioid use, satisfaction) as secondary outcomes.
We will specifically examine the effect of CPGs across marginalized groups to ensure that guideline
implementation does not exacerbate existing disparities in postoperative pain management. Our findings will
directly impact obstetric care by rigorously creating pragmatic, patient-centered guidelines to direct
postoperative opioid prescribing that are tailored to the unique needs of pregnant and birthing individuals.
Given the robust network of Collaborative hospital systems caring for a diverse cohort of pregnant individuals
in Michigan, our findings will provide critical evidence to direct optimal strategies for guideline dissemination
and implementation across the United States."
10891627,"While there have been great advances in HIV therapies over the past decades, the only true cure so far has
been through hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) of cells naturally lacking the HIV co-receptor CCR5.
Due to the toxicity of conditioning regimens prior to HSCT and significant morbidity due to graft-verses-host
disease (GVHD), allogeneic HSCT is not a viable option for most patients. With the advent of CRISPR,
modification of a patient’s own cells to prevent GVHD is now possible, but thus far the efficiency at which cells
have been modified was not enough to prevent viral rebound in the absence of anti-retroviral therapy. In line
with the rationale for combination anti-retroviral drug therapy to target multiple steps in replication, we have
developed a multi-factor knock-out/knock-in strategy for editing CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor
cells which allows greater than 90% deletion of CCR5, as well as up to 50% allelic knock-in of two inhibitory
peptides targeting either fusion (C46V2o) or uncoating (a human-rhesus chimeric TRIM5a). When using this
strategy to edit primary human CD4+ T cells, the efficiency of knock-out/knock-in is sufficient for complete
inhibition of CCR5-tropic virus (BaL), and an average of more than 700-fold inhibition of CXCR4-tropic virus
(NL4-3) when tested across 5 different primary human T cell donors. While these data are extremely
promising, there was a large disparity in the efficiency of inhibition of CXCR4-tropic replication by the human-
rhesus TRIM5a, with some T cell donors showing greater than 1,000-fold inhibition in the hRhTRIM5a knock-
in condition, and some showing little or no significant inhibition of replication. This observation was in spite of
sustained levels of allelic knock-in and hRhTRIM5a RNA expression throughout the course of the infection, and
no resistance mutations observed in the infectious virus at endpoint. We therefor propose here to study the
underlying T-cell/TRIM/virus interactions which may be uniquely donor specific and influence viral replication
including T cell cytokine expression, viral reactivation, and expression of endogenous cellular factors that may
act as a dominant negative to our inhibitory hRhTRIM5a in addition to investigation of other TRIM-related
factors for inhibition such as TRIMCyp. Although the final goal is to develop a therapy through transplantation
of edited hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, this proposal is entirely based on editing and investigating
the mechanisms of restriction in differentiated primary human target cells such as CD4+ T cells, monocytes,
and macrophages in order to better understand the biology within our editing platform and allow eventual
improvement of the platform. Successful completion of this proposal will allow a better understanding of
mechanisms of restriction in primary cells where often these mechanisms have been predominantly studied in
immortalized cell lines. In addition, completion of this proposal to improve our therapeutic platform will widen
the pool of patients potentially able to be treated using genetically modified autologous HSCT such as patients
later in infection that may have predominantly CXCR4-tropic virus."
10703707,"Our ability to learn and produce action sequences underlies much of what we do: be it communicating through writing, playing instruments, or simply tying shoelaces. Our reliance on these skills leaves us vulnerable to a wide range of brain disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s diseases which affect the basal ganglia circuits involved in their acquisition and execution. Our ability to help patients critically depends on a better understanding of basal ganglia function. Yet the principles of basal ganglia function and dysfunction in health and disease conditions remain elusive. The goal of this proposal is to combine objective, unsupervised behavioral clustering, cell-type-specific Cal-light tagging, and closed-loop optogenetic manipulation to test the hypothesis that activities of action-specific striatal ensembles are channeled through unique sets of output neurons that project to different target areas; therefore, modulating specific behaviors (e.g. locomotion, turning, reaching, rearing, etc.). During the K99 phase, I will test the hypothesis that the striatopallidal pathway can function as an action promoting pathway via direct output channels from the external globus pallidus (GPe) to parafascicular nucleus in the thalamus (GPe→Pf) and pedunculopontine nucleus in the brainstem (GPe→PPN). I will test the hypothesis that the GPe→PPN projection is mainly involved in the control of locomotion whereas GPe→Pf projection contributes to the initiation and execution of learned lever press. During the R00 phase, I will use a novel Cal-light system to tag action-specific spiny projection neurons (SPNs) and parse out diverse action-specific SPNs that go beyond the conventional view of direct versus indirect pathways. I will test the hypothesis that different subpopulations of GPe neurons receive input from unique action-specific SPNs, such that GPePPN neurons receive biased input from locomotion- specific SPNs while GPePf neurons are preferentially innervated by lever-pressing-specific SPNs.  This work and career development plan will be conducted in the vibrant research community at Columbia University under the supervision of Dr. Rui Costa and Dr. Hyungbae Kwon from Johns Hopkins University. In addition to technical expertise, both Drs. Costa and Kwon have an impressive track record of successful trainees. The candidate has also assembled a team of expert collaborators, including Dr. Darcy Peterka, Dr. Luke Hammond, Dr. Tanya Tabachnik, and Dr. David Ng. The entire mentoring team will guide the candidate in technical and professional training. Together, the proposed experiments will provide a mechanistic, circuit-level understanding of action-specific basal ganglia subcircuits that goes beyond the classical model. This work will have profound implications for a range of psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, with the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets. Additionally, all viral reagents, the new Cal-light tagging platform, mouse lines, and the computational tools developed and tested in this proposal will be shared with the broader neuroscience community to accelerate discoveries in other labs."
10918110,"ABSTRACT
Spatial mRNA organization plays a fundamental role in diverse cellular processes and disease. In large,
compartmentalized cells (e.g., neurons and embryos), subcellular mRNA localization offers a core mechanism
for the spatiotemporal regulation of protein synthesis. Since the initial discovery of subcellular mRNA distribution
in 1983, high-throughput imaging and sequencing methods have revealed that, in many cell types, thousands of
RNAs are localized to distinct compartments. For example, many axonal-related mRNAs in neurons will transport
to the “site of needed” along the very long (>100μm) axon, which likely play an important role in axon
development and local synaptic activities. Furthermore, mounting evidence shows a correlation between
aberrant spatial RNA organization and an increasing number of diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS), fragile X syndrome (FXS), and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). However, due to a lack of technologies
that allow for the tracking and manipulation of the spatial localization of endogenous mRNAs in primary cells and
in vivo, the mechanism and functional relevance of spatial organization has only been explored for a small
number of mRNAs. In this proposal, we seek to establish a set of technologies as a new foundation to study
spatial RNA biology, by developing an integrated framework that allows for sophisticated computational analysis,
real-time RNA tracking, and programmable spatial manipulation of any endogenous mRNA(s) in situ and in vivo,
on a high-throughput (>1,000 mRNAs in parallel) scale. To achieve this goal, we will start by building a deep
learning framework that can analyze spatially localized RNAs in different cell types and predict their associated
regulatory factors (e.g., RNA motifs, RNA binding proteins). This will provide an atlas of spatial RNA organization
as well as candidate RNAs for functional studies. Next, we will develop two novel approaches, RNA live-cell
fluorescent in situ hybridization (RNA-LiveFISH) for single-molecule, real-time dynamic tracking, and CRISPR-
mediated transcript organization (CRISPR-TO) for programmable manipulation of any target mRNA localization.
The two approaches form a new framework that enables us to study the regulatory mechanism and functional
relevance of subcellular mRNA localization with unprecedented ease and spatiotemporal resolution. Third, we
seek to apply this framework to study the function of mRNA localization in primary neurons, via high-throughput
manipulation of >1,000 mRNAs to uncover functions for axon guidance, growth cone development, and synaptic
activities. Selected functional mRNAs (>100) will be verified in vivo. Finally, we will apply the framework to
investigate the pathological mechanisms of aberrant RNA localization underlying the neurological disease spinal
muscular atrophy (SMA) in vitro and in vivo. We will not only dissect the relationship between mRNA organization
and SMA pathology, but also explore the strategy of modulating RNA localization for potential therapeutics. We
envision that the proposal will lead to new groundbreaking insights into the mechanism and functional roles of
whole-cell mRNA spatial organization for cellular and physiological functions that has not been revealed before."
10702248,"The goal of this proposal is to understand why people with diabetes develop severe fatty-rich plaques called
atherosclerosis in arteries. Atherosclerosis is linked to several cardiovascular diseases that cause disabilities
and premature death. Unfortunately, such serious medical problems are very frequent among veterans as they
are almost three times more likely to develop diabetes than people in the general population. One reason that
has been identified to enhance atherosclerosis among diabetic individuals is high blood sugar, often called
“hyperglycemia”. But exactly how hyperglycemia enhances atherosclerosis is not known.
Our research program aims to explore the role of microvesicles released by cells, called “exosomes”, as a source
of atherosclerosis. Our published and preliminary findings presented in our grant proposal show that both mice
and humans with diabetes accumulate exosomes in their bloodstream that can increase inflammatory signaling
when cultured with naïve cells. Our results also demonstrate that pro-inflammatory exosomes can be produced
by macrophages cultured in glucose-rich medium that we termed HG-exosomes. We found that HG-exosomes
simulate diabetic hyperglycemia by driving atherosclerosis when injected into non-diabetic mice. Remarkably,
we also uncovered that macrophages can produce anti-inflammatory exosomes when they are exposed to
protective cytokines such as interleukin-4. While we have reported that IL4-exosomes can exert protective effects
in suppressing atherosclerosis in non-diabetic mice, we do not know if they can do the same to control diabetic
atherosclerosis that is far more aggressive.
Based on our extensive findings, we propose to explore mechanisms through which HG-exosomes communicate
pro-inflammatory signaling in the immune system and the vessel wall. We also aim to investigate if IL4-exosomes
can serve to overcome the effects of hyperglycemia to suppress the progression of diabetic atherosclerosis.
Our First Aim will investigate molecular and cellular pathways through which HG-exosomes contribute to cause
cellular dysfunction in cultured macrophages. We will test if they do so by causing lipid accumulation and by
impairing the ability for macrophages to display protective anti-inflammatory activities that have been reported
to be critical in suppressing atherosclerosis, and are known to be defective in the setting of diabetes.
Our Second Aim will test if HG-exosome can communicate inflammatory signaling to fat cells called adipocytes
to increase their storage of oily lipids and thereby cause inflammatory signaling. We will also test if the injection
of HG-exosomes in to non-diabetic mice can cause them to develop diabetes as a result of increased visceral
fat accumulation, resulting in obesity and high blood glucose levels that then accelerate atherosclerosis. We will
test if IL4-exosomes can serve to prevent these effects to control atherosclerosis in obese diabetic mice.
Our Third Aim will test if HG-exosomes can serve to trigger a genetic process in bone marrow stem cells called
“metabolic memory of hyperglycemia”, resulting in long-lasting inflammation and susceptibility to atherosclerosis
even in non-diabetic mice.
Our findings will increase the appreciation for macrophage exosomes as contributors to diabetic atherosclerosis.
Importantly they could also lead to exosomes that may serve as new treatments for diabetic atherosclerosis."

In this K01 Mentored Scientist Development Award application, Dr. Andrew J. Lutkewitte outlines a detailed
strategy to further enhance his research training using sophisticated metabolic and lipidomic analysis. He will
utilize these approaches to discover novel mediators of systemic insulin resistance driven by insufficient adipose
tissue lipogenic capacity in obesity. Dr. Lutkewitte is currently a postdoctoral research fellow at Washington
University School of Medicine’s Division of Geriatrics and Nutritional Sciences. He has a strong background in
whole-body physiology and metabolism that he will draw upon to investigate adipose function during metabolic
stress. A primary goal of Dr. Lutkewitte is to become and independent investigator in lipid metabolism and
obesity-induced insulin resistance. He has carefully developed a research strategy with an integrated career
development and mentoring plan to ensue realization of this goal. Each of the chosen mentors are leading
experts in their respective fields which are directly related to this proposal. The primary mentor Dr. Brian Finck
will assist with the metabolic characterization and analysis of both animal and cell culture models. From Dr. Nada
Abumrad, he will learn stromal vascular fraction isolations, gain understanding about mechanisms of adipocyte
differentiation and lipogenesis, and fundamentals of lipid uptake/export. Dr. Gary Patti will train Dr. Lutkewitte in
both targeted and untargeted metabolomics as well as metabolic flux analysis using isotopic tracers in vivo.
Besides research training, Dr. Finck and a “Near Peer” mentoring team will provide Dr. Lutkewitte with the
essential skills to initiate and maintain a successful, independent laboratory. The ability of adipose tissue to
regulate lipid stores (mainly, triglycerides) is vital for preserving metabolic health. In fact, an imbalance between
the appropriate release (lipolysis) or synthesis (lipogenesis) of lipids in adipose tissue increases the risk of
pathologies such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, systemic insulin resistance and ultimately type 2 diabetes.
Yet, the fundamental mechanisms of how adipose tissue regulates systemic insulin sensitivity remain unclear.
Recent evidence suggests that phosphatidic acid, the substrate for lipin 1, a phosphatidic acid phosphatase, is
present at high levels in the blood and has deleterious effects in insulin sensitive tissues such as skeletal muscle
and liver. The goals of this work are to: [1] determine how the posttranslational modification, acetylation, effects
lipin 1 activity and cellular localization, [2] discover the specific acetylated lysine residues regulating lipin 1, [3]
define how adipose tissue lipin 1 regulates whole-body metabolism and insulin sensitivity, and [4] to identify how
phosphatidic acid and similar lipids mediate these effects. The end goal of this research progression is to develop
Dr. Lutkewitte into a productive, independent investigator. Together the training in research and career
development plan outlined here will provide him with the knowledge and expertise to secure an independent
academic position and R01-type funding."
10891528,"Project Summary: Single-Cell and Spatial Transcriptomics (SCST) Core
Single cell transcriptomics permits researchers to analyze tissue heterogeneity and complexity in disease states.
These technologies add enormous value to research strategies aimed at discovering new disease-specific cell
surface markers, drug targets, molecular subtypes of tumors, etc. However, common single cell-omics platforms
are limited by high cost and access to robust computational analysis. The goals of the Single-Cell and Spatial
Transcriptomics (SCST) Core are to lower barriers of entry to single cell and spatial transcriptomics technologies
for CMTDD investigators and the broader UNMC community at a reasonable cost, offer consultations and
technical assistance for training new users, enable users to analyze complex datasets, and remain adaptable to
increase capacity and tools as needed from the UNMC community. The working hypothesis is that increased
access to these emergent and powerful technologies will pay dividends on the back end in the form of more
impactful publications and a higher rate of grant funding. To achieve these goals, we will provide users with
sufficient low-cost equipment, consultations, and computational tools to analyze single cell and spatial
transcriptomics data. Pioneering work in the Shalek group identified a lower cost solution to droplet based
scRNA-seq called Seq-Well to generate high quality libraries. We have successfully implemented Seq-Well at
UNMC and generated hiqh quality data with unique biological insights. Our core also will provide subsidized
access to spatial transcriptomics (MERSCOPE). Thus, the SCST core will provide low-cost access to Seq-Well
and MERSCOPE, allowing for a range of options for high resolution molecular profiling of tissue and cellular
heterogeneity in complex systems. Implementation of these tools at UNMC will enable investigators to develop
innovative new research areas. The SCST will ensure that cutting edge computational tools are available to
users who want to conduct their own rigorous data analysis and anticipate and develop new low-cost “omics”
technologies. By lowering the financial bar of access to these technologies, research program competitiveness
will increase, enhancing publication impact factors, grant funding, patents, and faculty recruitment to UNMC."

Basic scientists and clinical investigators from Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) join forces with
their counterparts at University of California, San Francisco’s (UCSF) Helen Diller Family Comprehensive
Cancer Center to propose a Harvard/UCSF ROBIN Center. Our Objective is to improve potency and
selectivity of two key radiation modalities--external beam radiation and radiopharmaceuticals. A distinctive
feature of our ROBIN Center is its selection of two clinically aggressive pediatric tumors--diffuse midline glioma
(DMG) and high-risk neuroblastoma (NBL) – as scientific vehicles for the study plan. The genetic drivers of
these two pediatric cancers are found also in more common adult solid tumors. Moreover, the low mutational
burden of these pediatric cancers provides a clean genetic background for the “low N/high content” Molecular
Characterization Trials (MCTs) specified by the ROBIN RFA. The malignant cells within DMG and NBL are
heterogenous with respect to developmental stage. The central hypothesis of our study plan is that this
developmental heterogeneity is echoed at the level of radiation-response mechanisms and enables radiation
resistance. Our study plan features two research projects configured to test predictions of this hypothesis.
 Project 1 draws upon paired samples of pre-and post-radiotherapy tumor tissue from children treated
prospectively with a uniform radiotherapy regimen to test the prediction that radiation selects for radioresistant
intra-tumoral variants. Project 2 tests the prediction that 131I-MIBG therapy of aggressive neuroblastoma
selects for intra-tumoral subtypes with unfavorable responses to treatment. Our ROBIN MCT provides
resources needed to complete the objectives and specific aims of the two Projects. Multimodal analysis and
mathematical modeling of data from the Projects and the MCT will be performed in a Clinical Artificial
Intelligence and Imaging Core and a Molecular Data Science and Advanced Dosimetry Core. A Cross-
Training Core and an Administrative Core will support scientific activities and serve also as the Center’s
“outward face” to the broader scientific community and lay public.
 The Center will serve as a “value-added” component of the NCI’s extramural support mission by
leveraging (i) P30 core facilities of DF/HCC and UCSF, (ii) a U54-funded DFCI Physical Sciences Oncology
Center, and (iii) the NCI's Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network and National Clinical Trials
Networks. Conversely, an NCI ROBIN award to the Harvard/UCSF Center would be “value-added” to the field
of radiation oncology by catalyzing productive interactions between radiation biology, artificial intelligence, and
data science – disciplines that are well-established in Boston and San Francisco but have never been applied
coordinately to the problem of radioresistance. Center co-leads, Professors Daphne Haas-Kogan M.D. and
Franziska Michor, Ph.D. have much experience in management of multi-investigator, multi-institutional
research programs together with complementary skillsets in radiation oncology and advanced data science."
10931428,"The Harvard/UCSF ROBIN Center will address molecular mechanisms of radiation response and resistance
in childhood cancers, using the “quieter” genome of pediatric malignancies to identify radiation resistance
mechanisms that are broadly applicable to adult and pediatric patients. The Center consists of a Molecular
Characterization Trial, two Research Projects, two supporting Cores [one focused on Data Science and
Advanced Dosimetry and the second on Imaging and Artificial Intelligence (AI)] as well as the critical Cross-
Training Core (ROBIN-NEST). Collectively, these ROBIN Center components can be conceptualized as
either “Scientific” or “Programmatic” in nature.
 Against this backdrop, this Administrative Core has two broad goals. Firstly, as the ROBIN Center’s
“inward looking face”, the Administrative Core will support the Scientific and Programmatic missions. Secondly,
the Administrative Core will serve as the “outward face” of the Harvard/UCSF Center and as point of contact
with NCI, other ROBIN Centers, diverse learners, the radiation sciences workforce, and the lay public. The
Administrative Core has three Specific Aims.
 Aim 1 (Scientific Support): The Administrative Core will implement electronic communication
methods to facilitate transfer of accounting information, access to Research and Technology Management
forms, access to clinical research databases, and access to cloud-based data and code sharing platforms.
 Aim 2 (Programmatic Support): The Core will integrate the Harvard/UCSF sites and unify the Center
via videoconferencing, in-person meetings, and online communication. Together with the ROBIN-NEST, the
Core will host an Annual Retreat to share and harmonize vision and logistics across the ROBIN Center. Finally,
the Core will request applications for, evaluate, award, and administer pilot and trans-Network Projects.
 Aim 3 (NCI and Community Service): The Administrative Core will create the Harvard/UCSF
ROBIN Center’s website as a public-facing source of data and resources. Critically, the Core will also work to
strengthen the Harvard/UCSF Center with proactive strategies to enhance diversity of our research groups,
the radiation sciences workforce, communities served by our Center, and patients enrolled in our clinical trials.
 Daphne Haas-Kogan, M.D. and Franziska Michor, Ph.D. will serve as co-leaders of the Administrative
Core and also as co-PIs of the Harvard/UCSF ROBIN itself. Each of the co-leads has extensive experience in
leading multi-investigator, multi-institutional research initiatives. Dr. Haas-Kogan is the Chair of the Department
of Radiation Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Boston

10931431,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Molecular Characterization Trial (MCT) is the source of biospecimen and data resources for the ROBIN
Center. As such, its success is paramount to the success of the entire initiative, and strategies that expedite
the acquisition of these essential resources will accelerate the timeframe in which they are made available for
all the innovative work performed in the Research Projects and Cores. The Harvard/UCSF ROBIN has chosen
for its theme the study of pediatric malignancies as the optimal setting for in depth investigation into the impact
of heterogeneity, in both its tumor cell intrinsic and extrinsic manifestations, on radiation responses. The MCT
will achieve these goals via the following Aims: Aim 1: Coordinate the collection of biospecimens and
clinical data from cooperative group studies for use in ROBIN studies. The MCT will leverage two ongoing
trials: Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium PNOC023 for diffuse midline glioma (DMG), and
Children’s Oncology Group (COG) ANBL1531 for neuroblastoma (NBL). The study chairs for each trial are co-
leads of the MCT and Project 2, respectively. As a novel feature of the MCT, matched pairs of tumor samples
will be available from subjects who underwent pre-treatment biopsies and subsequently had post-treatment
surgical (NBL) or post-mortem (DMG) tissues obtained via established protocols. The ROBIN investigators will
also leverage additional resources that are uniquely available to them, including a collection of thirty DMG
tumor samples that are distinct from those obtained on the PNOC023 study and already in hand. The MCT will
also bolster an aim on late effects by obtaining blood samples and clinical data from the COG Late Effects after
High-Risk Neuroblastoma (LEAHRN) study, which includes 24 long-term survivors previously treated with the
radiopharmaceutical 131I-MIBG. Aim 2: Manage the regulatory aspects of the MCT, including site protocols
for collection of protected health information (PHI) and biospecimens in institutional biorepositories. Clinical
research and data coordinators will work with site leads at both Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center and
UCSF to ensure rigorous and timely submission of study protocols, amendments, and continuing reviews so
that the work can steadfastly proceed. Also, because all PHI will flow through the MCT, which provides de-
identified resources to other ROBIN components, this will minimize risks to subject confidentiality. Aim 3:
Maintain standard operating procedures for processing and analyzing tumor, blood and CSF samples and
storing incoming and resultant high-dimensional data. Given the vast amounts of data involved, and the
intricate assays being performed, it is essential that the work is performed in a harmonized way to maintain
rigor and reproducibility. The MCT will rely on the combined expertise within the Clinical Artificial Intelligence
and Imaging Core and the Molecular Data Science and Advanced Dosimetry Core to ensure compliance
with de-identification and data storage standards so that the rich resources generated by the ROBIN can be
used effectively by the broader research community in pilot projects and beyond."
10931435,"Project Summary
Conventional wisdom holds that radiation therapy is a physically targeted anti-cancer modality and that its
cancer targets are genetically and biologically uniform. However, the stromal composition of tumors is complex
and variable giving rise to extrinsic variability of the cancer target. Moreover, recent studies using single cell
genomics show intrinsic heterogeneity even within the tumor cells per se. The broad goal of our
Harvard/UCSF ROBIN initiative is to test the hypothesis that intra-tumoral variability underlies resistance to -
and relapse from – radiotherapy. Towards this goal, our Center has chosen to focus on pediatric cancers of
neuro-ectodermal origin. Pediatric tumors have a low mutational burden relative to common adult cancers and
thus a cleaner genetic surround for the “low N/high content” Molecular Characterization Trials specified by
the ROBIN RFA. Against this backdrop, this project focuses upon diffuse midline glioma (DMG) of children.
 The majority of DMGs initially respond to radiation, but all progress, and none are cured. In preliminary
studies, we have used single cell genomics to show that the malignant cells within DMG are developmentally
heterogeneous. Our testable hypothesis is that DMG intratumoral heterogeneity transcends developmental
markers to include differential expression/utilization of common DNA repair pathways. This hypothesis makes
predictions that will be assessed by drawing upon paired samples of pre-and post-radiotherapy tumor tissue
from children treated prospectively with a uniform radiotherapy regimen and profiled in our Molecular
Characterization Trial (MCT). We have three specific aims: Aim 1 is to test the prediction that intratumoral
heterogeneity is reflected at levels above and beyond tumor cell-specific developmental markers noted our
preliminary studies; Aim 2 is to test the prediction that radiotherapy reduces DMG intratumoral heterogeneity
via selection of replication-competent, radio-resistant stem-like cancer cells; Aim 3 is to test the prediction that
heterogeneous radiation responses within tumor cells underlie patient heterogeneity in radiation-associated
toxicities, neurocognitive effects and quality of life.
 The study plan incorporates contemporary methods in cancer genomics, epigenomics, chromatin
biology and DNA enzymology. We will draw upon our Clinical Artificial Intelligence and Imaging Core to
develop non-invasive methods to track intra-tumoral heterogeneity in these (surgically challenging) pediatric
tumors. With our Molecular Data Science and Advanced Dosimetry Core, we will develop computational
modeling of tumor cell evolution and treatment response that will be critical to understanding selection for
radioresistant subclones. The co-leaders of this Project have complementary expertise to enable the study
plan. Daphne Haas-Kogan, M.D. is a pediatric radiation oncologist who treats patients with DMG and holds
leadership positions in two key consortia (COG and PNOC) for pediatric clinical trials. Mariella Filbin,
M.D./Ph.D. is a pediatric neuro-oncologist with expertise in single cell genomics and DMG biology."
10931440,"Project Summary
 Radiopharmaceuticals have shown tremendous clinical promise, resulting in regulatory approvals of
several agents. Such targeted radiotherapy exposes tumor cells to continuous, exponentially decaying
radiation, resulting in biological effects distinct from those of external beam radiotherapy. Despite this
fundamental difference, there is limited understanding of the impact of radiopharmaceuticals on tumor cell
populations and other components of the tumor microenvironment such as stromal cells, immune
compartments, and endothelial cells. The proposed work will provide novel insights into tumor cell-intrinsic and
-extrinsic mechanisms of radiation response that can inform the study of radiopharmaceuticals across
oncology.
 Against this backdrop, Project 2 will deeply characterize samples, imaging, and data from a cohort of
children with high-risk neuroblastoma treated with the targeted radiopharmaceutical 131I-MIBG. In Aim 1, we
will evaluate pre-treatment tumor cell-intrinsic and tumor cell-extrinsic factors, including somatic and host
genomic variants, single cell and bulk transcriptomics, and DNA damage repair profiling. In Aim 2, we will
assess dynamic changes in these factors in response to 131I-MIBG therapy, including evaluation of tumor
materials resected after 131I-MIBG as well as serial circulating tumor DNA samples. In Aim 3, we will leverage
two large national studies to assess the late effects of 131I-MIBG in this vulnerable pediatric population. By the
conclusion of Project 2, we will understand predictors of response and toxicity following 131I-MIBG therapy and,
more fundamentally, will understand the changes in a comprehensive set of molecular markers reflective of
radiation biology following treatment with this radiopharmaceutical.
 We have embedded our work within the only randomized phase 3 trial of 131I-MIBG ever conducted,
COG ANBL1531 (NCT03126916). However, beyond our utilization of goal-oriented clinical trials to enable a
question-oriented, hypothesis-driven study plan in close collaboration with our Data Science and AI Cores,
Project 2 advances several transformative innovations. A major barrier limiting our understanding of the
biological effects of radiopharmaceuticals is a lack of paired tumor samples obtained before and after exposure
to radiation. Our work overcomes this barrier by exploiting our unique access to detailed, cross-sectional data
on long-term medical, psychological, and educational outcomes, coupled with paired, longitudinal biologic
specimens, dosimetry, serial images, data science, mechanistic computational modeling, and radiomics to
identify the critical changes in our markers of tumor heterogeneity that are associated with 131I-MIBG response
and late effects. Importantly, biospecimens are available from patients treated with or without 131I-MIBG
therapy on this trial, enabling us to validate specific markers as truly predictive rather than simply prognostic.
Finally, our proposal leverages a series of other federally-funded efforts in order to establish an enduring,
collaborative initiative with broad impacts at the intersection of radiation oncology and cancer biology."
10931445,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The convergence of radiation oncology, cancer genomics, data science, computational modeling, and artificial
intelligence presents spectacular opportunities and challenges. In the Harvard/UCSF ROBIN, we propose to
capitalize on these opportunities to improve our understanding of radiation response and resistance. The
clinical vehicles for our ROBIN Center are diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) and neuroblastoma, the two most
clinically significant pediatric tumors of neural ectodermal origin. We hypothesize that intratumoral
heterogeneity drives radiation response and resistance, and that the mechanisms thereof can be identified by
deciphering tumor cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic components of the tumor microenvironment before, during, and
after radiotherapy. The Molecular Data Science and Advanced Dosimetry Core (Data Science Core) is an
essential component of the Harvard/UCSF ROBIN Center. It will serve as the hub for data storage and
management, analysis, and integration of all molecular datatypes generated by the Center, advanced
dosimetry modeling, and predictive computational modeling platforms. Specifically, the Core will work to (i)
retrieve, curate, and manage molecular data related to the Harvard/UCSF ROBIN Center and provide the
infrastructure necessary to efficiently provide access to all data required for achieving the ROBIN goals; (ii)
analyze and integrate all molecular data types generated in Projects 1 and 2; (iii) generate advanced
dosimetry data, including accurate distributions of dose for radionuclide therapy and dose received by tumor
cells, that are required to investigate the biological hypotheses proposed in Projects 1 and 2; (iv) conduct
mechanistic modeling of radiation effects and evolution of resistance to radiotherapy that directly supports the
aims of Projects 1 and 2 and can inform data collection and address the hypotheses of the ROBIN Center;
and (v) share findings and novel methods with the ROBIN Network and the scientific community at large.
Toward these ends, the Core will coordinate its activities closely with Projects 1 and 2 and the other cores, in
particular with the AI Core, focusing on imaging, radiomics, and natural language processing, and the
Molecular Characterization Trial. The Core will also work closely with the Cross-Training Core and the
Administrative Core to reach other members of the ROBIN Network and the larger scientific community. The
Core will be directed by two investigators, Drs. Michor and Seo, who have expansive and complementary
expertise and have assembled a team of experienced investigators to contribute to the goals of the Core. We
anticipate that the results of the Data Science Core will be broadly utilized by all components of the ROBIN
Center and the larger ROBIN Network as well as the broader scientific community, and will significantly
contribute to understanding data science and dosimetry/cancer evolution aspects across a broad suite of
cancers and treatments."

Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have the potential to fundamentally change medicine through their ability to
recognize complex patterns in medical data. The Clinical Artificial Intelligence and Imaging Core (AI Core)
is an essential shared resource that will support the Aims of the Harvard/UCSF ROBIN Research Projects to
enable large-scale analysis of granular clinical data, allowing non-invasive characterization of tumoral and
patient heterogeneity and a path towards clinical translation. This will be achieved through the following
Specific Aims: i) retrieve, curate, and annotate digitized clinical data to support quantitative analyses and
AI/informatics pipelines for the ROBIN Molecular Characterization Trial and Research Projects, which will
produce one of the most comprehensive datasets for DMG and neuroblastoma patients in existence for AI-
based data analysis, ii) develop and evaluate task-specific AI pipelines using our well-established data
preprocessing, AI-derived imaging biomarkers, and natural language processing (NLP) platforms for tumor
heterogeneity, radiation resistance/response, and toxicity characterization in accordance with the Research
Projects and Data Science Core, and iii) standardize and release AI/informatics methods across data types
and applications in ways that ensure transparency, reproducibility, and access to advance scientific knowledge
within the wider research field, as well as accelerate clinical translation to the pediatric radiation oncology
clinic. Achieving these aims will be possible through synergy with the molecular mechanistic analyses in the
Data Science Core, as well as with the ROBIN-NEST Cross-Training Core and Administrative Core to
disseminate our methods and provide training to the greater ROBIN Network and the scientific community.
This Core is led by pioneers in the field of AI analysis of medical imaging (PI: Aerts) and clinical text (PI:
Savova), with significant experience building open access platforms for medical AI applications. For imaging
analysis, we developed and maintain PyRadiomics, one of the world’s most widely used and highly cited
radiomics pipelines, developed with support of NCI’s investments in infrastructure and data, including the
Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR), Imaging Data Commons (IDC), and Quantitative Imaging
Network (QIN) programs. For clinical text, we have developed Apache cTakes(™), a leading open access
natural language processing platform for extracting medical, grammatical, and semantic information from
clinical texts, and DeepPhe, an open-source software for cancer clinical phenotyping, also supported by the
NCI’s ITCR program (PI: Savova). We will use and build on our open access methods and state-of-the art AI-
based phenotyping methods developed in these NCI projects to support the Harvard/UCSF ROBIN
investigators to incorporate fundamental clinical -omics data into their investigation of intratumoral
heterogeneity and predictors of radiation response and late effects."

10891593,"Alpha genus human papillomaviruses (HPV’s) cause benign squamous papillomas in which the virus persists and replicates. “Low risk” HPV types cause papillomas that while persisting, very rarely progress to malignancy, but can cause serious, even life-threatening medical complications due to the size and location of the papilloma. In both high-risk and low-risk HPV types, papilloma formation is driven by the expression of viral oncoproteins termed E6 and E7. Both high risk and low risk HPV E6 proteins associate with a cellular ubiquitin ligase termed E6AP. When high-risk E6 binds E6AP, E6 then recruits the cellular tumor suppressor p53 which is then ubiquitinated and degraded. Low-risk E6 proteins, while also binding E6AP, do not interact with p53, and the cellular targets it binds and degrades have until recently remained undescribed. Since low- risk and high-risk HPV both co-evolved on the same host, it is reasonable to speculate that there might be common cellular targets for both high and low risk E6 oncoproteins. Identifying cellular proteins that are broadly E6-targeted is a long-sought goal of the viral oncogenesis field. This application describes the first cellular target of the E6 + E6AP complex that is targeted for degradation by both high risk and low risk E6 proteins, NHERF1. Importantly, E6 proteins from cutaneous HPV’s as well as evolutionarily distant animal papillomaviruses also target the degradation of NHERF1. The broad tissue-type and broad species targeting of NHERF1 by their cognate E6 proteins argues for its importance in the papillomavirus life-cycle. We will present data showing how the targeting of NHERF1 by both high and low risk E6 augments cellular WNT signaling, and augments cell-cell competition in cells that express E6. We propose additional studies on both the mechanism of E6 interaction with NHERF1 and the consequences of NHERF1 degradation by E6."
10901962,"NK cell deficiency (NKD) is a subset of primary immunodeficiency diseases/inborn errors of immunity (IEI) in
which the NK cell abnormality represents the main clinical immunodeficiency. Patients with abnormal NK cells
are susceptible to lethal virus infections and certain cancers, offering us a unique window into how these
critical immune cells work. For over 15 years we have cared for and investigated these complex patients,
applying genomic techniques to discover causative genes and illuminate NK cell biology. With this application,
we aspire to renew our coordinated NKD discovery program, with the ultimate goals of understanding how to
care for these patients as well as how to best use NK cells therapeutically. Over the past 5 years of our
program, we have defined 2 new genetic causes of NKD and 8 new causes of IEI that affect NK cells. We
established and grew an international referral network for NKD patients, honed methods to clinically and
immunologically define these rare patients, matured our genomic evaluation/discovery pathways, and
optimized patient-focused functional genomics and NK cell biological techniques, all to advance progress in
understanding NKD. At present, we have 156 patients enrolled in our NK cell evaluation and research (NEAR)
program at Columbia: of these, 70 have undergone exome sequencing (ES) at Baylor College of Medicine, 13
have found genetic solutions for their disease, 11 have a promising gene identified, and 36 remain unsolved.
During this renewal period, we will build on our successful momentum, adding new NKD patients to our
pipeline, clinically and immunologically defining their disease through the use of databases, advanced
biostatistical techniques and research level phenotypic and functional assessments (Aim 1), adding new
genomic discovery and analytic techniques like whole genome sequencing and RNA sequencing to bring
clarity to the patients whose NKD genes remain “unsolved” (Aim 2), and applying cutting-edge functional
genomics and NK cell biological techniques to demonstrate the impact and relevance of the gene mutations we
discover (Aim 3). We capitalize on strong, long-standing collaborations both within and beyond the field of
Immunodeficiency in order to best define how the gene mutations we identify impact how NK cells function in
human health. In so doing, we aim to not only better diagnose and care for these complex patients, but to
better understand how NK cells protect humans from viruses and cancer."

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 has resulted in an ongoing epidemic of acute respiratory illness that
has stressed the world’s health care systems and led to >6 million deaths. The lack of therapeutic options for
treating coronavirus infections continues to expose the population to grave risk from emerging variants as well
as future zoonotic coronavirus infections. Accelerated drug discovery/development techniques, including drug
repurposing and fast follower drug design have only resulted in the approval of a single orally bioavailable
inhibitor. Nirmatrelvir/Paxlovid is contraindicated in a large fraction of patients, susceptible to emerging
resistant variants and may not demonstrate cross-activity against future coronavirus threats. Therefore, future
efforts should focus on the development of new antivirals including those that possess complementary
mechanisms of action and resistance profiles. During this Phase 2 project, we will execute a medicinal
chemistry/profiling strategy and complete optimization of a novel series of SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors to
improve their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses as well as their pharmacokinetic
properties. The overall goal of this project is to select a Development Candidate for the treatment of COVID-19

10830447,"Project Summary
Our goal is to advance a novel, safe and effective sublingual (SL) vaccine against Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng)
infection.
Antibiotic resistant Ng is an interconnected global threat to people, animals, and the environment. Furthermore,
approximately 50% of all annual Ng infections in the US are drug-resistant1. The emergence of drug-resistant
Ng is accelerating, and previous antibiotic treatments such as penicillin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and
cefixime are no longer recommended1, 2. A single recommended treatment remains – ceftriaxone. Current
research suggests that it is the suppression of Th1 and Th2 responses by Ng, modulated by increased Th17
responses, which drives Ng infection and re-infection3-5. Protection from Ng is thought to benefit from a robust
Th1 response or balanced Th1/Th2 response3, 6, 7. However, current Ng vaccination approaches mainly using
aluminum salt do not induce appropriate Th1/2 responses, limiting vaccine efficacy4, 8, 9. A vaccine that
generates a strong Th1, or a more balanced Th1/Th2 response, with robust mucosal immunity, would
significantly enhance Ng vaccine efficacy.
Current Ng vaccine approaches are mainly focused on developing novel parenteral vaccines4, 8. Parenteral
vaccines are generally effective at stimulating systemic antibody-mediated immune responses but are less
effective at inducing mucosal immunity10-12. Parenteral vaccines require significant resources for cold-chain
management and administration, which translate into slow global vaccination. Since low- and middle-income
countries have the highest Ng burden, new vaccines must support global delivery.
Our project team brings together three innovative aspects and areas of expertise that will make a novel SL Ng
vaccine a reality. First, we have identified novel Ng antigens expressed during natural mucosal infection that
generate cross-reactive antibody responses. Second, our novel TLR4 agonist, INI-2005, induces robust
systemic and mucosal immune response following SL administration. Third, INI-2005 demonstrates good
synthesis and thermostability properties and appears safe.
Building from this work, this application is designed to validate a SL Ng vaccine consisting of a novel SL
adjuvant, INI-2005, and three unique Ng antigens identified from a reverse vaccinology-like approach. The
specific aims of this Phase I SBIR application are to: 1) Produce and benchmark the TLR agonist and Ng
antigens; 2) Determine the optimal SL formulation to maximize immune responses in mice; and 3)
Demonstrate that the SL formulation effectively protects mice against Ng infection. Funding of this application
will validate a SL vaccine to prevent Ng infection, designed for robust Th1 immune responses and mucosal
immunity, administered easily, and thermostable for rapid, global distribution."
10850548,"Project Summary/Abstract
Arterial and venous thromboses are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in in two
myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs): polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET),
associated with JAK2, and in ET in addition to JAK2 also calreticulin (CALR), and infrequently
thrombopoietin receptor (cMPL) somatic mutations. However, the molecular mechanism of
thrombosis is largely unknown. In multivariate analyses, the leukocyte count independently correlates
with their risk of thromboses. Our published work demonstrates that the hypoxia inducible
transcription factors (HIF-1 and HIF-2), which are upregulated in both granulocytes and platelets in
PV and ET, promote the transcription of prothrombotic and proinflammatory genes. Leukocytes are
the only source of tissue factor (TF) in the blood, and we also showed that PV neutrophils constitutively
express TF activity. Transcripts of Krüppel-like Factor 2 (KLF2) - a zinc finger transcription factor, are
down regulated in granulocytes and platelets from PV and ET patients and correlate inversely with the
transcripts of prothrombotic genes, suggesting that KLF2 might be a suppressor of thrombotic gene
expression in these conditions. In Chuvash erythrocytosis/polycythemia (CE) - a congenital disorder
associated with increased HIF-1 and HIF-2 due to a hypomorphic R200W mutation of the Von Hippel-
Lindau (VHL) gene, the incidence of thrombosis is higher than in PV and phlebotomy did not prevent
thrombosis but instead appeared to have facilitated it. Repeated phlebotomies induced iron deficiency
(ID) which further increased the level of HIF-1 and HIF-2 by inhibiting the negative HIFs regulator
prolyl hydroxylase domain 2 (PHD2) enzyme, which requires iron as a co-factor. Therefore, we
hypothesize that the up-regulation of HIF signaling in ET and PV granulocytes and platelets, perhaps
with an additional contribution of augmented inflammation, plays a central role in the development of
thrombosis. In order to achieve our objective, we propose to follow these specific aims (SA):
SA 1a. Determine whether the correction of ID decreases HIF signaling and ameliorates the thrombotic
milieu in PV and ET.
SA 1b. Determine the effect of HIFs in PV and ET thrombosis using inhibitors of HIF-1, HIF2 and JAKs.
SA 2. Extend our observations from mRNA transcripts of HIF-regulated, prothrombotic and
antithrombotic genes and inflammatory genes to the activity of TF in all blood lineages.
SA 3. Determine the role of KLF2 in increasing the risk of thrombosis in PV and ET and its regulation
and elucidate in more detail the interaction of KLF2 and HIFs.
We submit that proving our hypothesis will uncover novel mechanisms of thrombosis in PV and ET
and open new therapeutic targets for prevention of thrombosis in PV and ET."

structured mechanism for identifying outstanding candidates through an open and competitive application and
review process and matching the resulting awardees with experienced mentors. The CEP Leaders will convene
a NIH format study section and assign NIH R21-type applications to two scientific and one patient advocate
reviewers. Review results will be summarized in the Administrative Core and submitted to the Internal Advisory
Board for recommendations for funding. Successful applications will be funded at the level of $50,000 per year
for up to two years (total award $100,000). We anticipate funding four awards per year, depending on the funding
year. CEP awardees will be provided full access to the Roswell Park Ovarian Cancer SPORE Core resources,
including tissue specimens and statistical support. The CEP will directly facilitate career development through:
i) a constructive proposal review by the Roswell Park Ovarian Cancer SPORE Executive Committee and Internal
Advisory Board, which are composed of talented investigators with expertise in basic, clinical, and population-
based research, ii) research training with a mentor chosen from among a diverse faculty with broad expertise in
academic career development, and iii) access to development/enrichment programs, including ovarian cancer
disease site research group meetings, periodic SPORE meetings, seminar series, and Roswell Park Ovarian
Cancer SPORE annual retreats. In summary, the CEP provides a vital mechanism for the development of the
next generation of translational ovarian cancer researchers at Roswell Park and affiliated institutions."
10813781,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The long-term goal of this proposal is to identify the pathophysiology underlying HIV associated COPD.
People living with HIV (PLWH) show increased incidence of COPD even when compensated for smoking status.
MicroRNAs manage the cellular transcriptome and play important roles in health and disease. We have shown
that HIV Tat and Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling dysregulate the airway microRNAome.
Dysregulation of the microRNAome can effect multiple signaling pathways and this can affect cellular
homeostasis. COPD is a multifactorial pathology and involves dysregulation of diverse signaling pathways that
converge towards airway mitochondrial disfunction, circadian dysregulation, remodeling, inflammation, etc. TGF-
β signaling is induced by both HIV Tat and cigarette smoke and this is significant since a significant proportion
of PLWH are addicted to nicotine and smoke tobacco/cigarettes, possibly exacerbating their progression to
COPD. Hence, Tat and TGF-β-induced aberrant microRNAome and its effects on the airway
transcriptome can serve as an initiating events with downstream consequences on critical signaling
nodes and pathways. Identifying these pathways and these critical signaling nodes can help tailor interventions
to improve long-term pulmonary outcomes in PLWH.
 Lungs are important HIV reservoirs and we, and others have shown that airway epithelial cells express
canonical HIV receptors and can be infected with HIV. A recent study shows that the bulk of HIV reservoirs are
transcriptionally active even with suppressive cART. Hence, silencing HIV transcription can decrease HIV
proteins like Tat in the airway. Gene editing using CRISPR/Cas9 has tremendous potential in eliminating HIV
reservoirs and reports have shown excision of HIV from infected cells. However, CRISPR based HIV excision is
vulnerable to viral escape as well as off-target effects. Cyclin T1, a component of P-TEFb, (heterodimer of
cyclinT1 and CDK9) is bound by HIV Tat and plays a pivotal role HIV transcription and its inhibition abolishes
HIV transcription. Hence CRISPR mediated CyclinT1 inactivation will completely block HIV transcription, locking
the HIV proviral DNA in an inactive form. We will use our patented Pol II HIV LTR-drosophila hsp70 fusion
monopromoter to co-express CyclinT1 gRNA and Cas9 (and effect CyclinT1 inactivation) only in HIV
infected cells. Expression is self-limiting as our fusion promoter also requires CyclinT1 thereby minimizing off-
target effects. Aim 1 will determine the mechanism by which HIV Tat and TGF-β dysregulate the airway
microRNAome and its effects on the transcriptome to identify signaling pathways involved in HIV associated
COPD. Aim 2 will use an inducible CRISPR syste to inactivate CyclinT1 only in HIV infected cells and lock the
proviral DNA in a transcriptionally inactive state. Understanding the signaling pathways that promote HIV-
associated COPD and silencing HIV transcription in reservoirs will prevent lung function decline and
development of COPD in PLWH."
10838618,"Abstract:
Kaposi’s Sarcoma (KS)-Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) is a human g-herpesvirus responsible for KS, pleural
effusion lymphoma (PEL), multlicentric Castleman’s disease (MCD) and KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome
(KICS). KS and PEL are HIV-AIDS-defining malignancies that occur at high frequency during AIDS, but also
after treatment with ART especially in endemic regions. KSHV oncogenesis is driven by the complex life cycle
of KSHV involving long-term latent infection of B-lymphocytes, reactivation and persistent infection of lymphatic
endothelial and mesenchymal stem cells, and immune evasion. KSHV encoded nuclear antigen LANA is
expressed in all KSHV-associated tumors and is essential for maintenance of the viral episome during latent
infection in proliferating cells. KSHV LANA is also thought to contribute directly to viral oncogenesis and
pathogenesis through interactions with tumor suppressor proteins and rewiring of host gene expression
programs. We have previously shown that LANA contributes to the viral DNA replication, epigenetic regulation
and higher-order structure of KSHV episomes. We have also identified chromatin organizing factors, such as
CTCF and cohesins, as key regulatory factors in the control of latent gene expression and restriction of lytic
reactivation. More recently, we have explored KS tumor transcriptomics and drug sensitivity assays to identify
metabolic pathways implicated in the regulation of LANA and KSHV-infected cell survival. We now propose to
advance each of these findings and continue our long-term effort to understand the role of LANA in episome
maintenance, latency regulation, and oncogenesis. Specifically, we will investigate (1) the role of LANA in
regulating latency-associated DNA replication and genome integrity through a potential intrinsic tyrosine
recombinase activity that regulates replication termination and genome decatenation at the viral terminal repeats,
(2) the role of LANA and cellular chromatin organizing factors DAXX, CTCF and cohesin in forming higher-order
nuclear bodies that protect and organize the viral episome to maintain stable genomes and gene expression
patterns in latently infected cells, and (3) how onco-metabolic stress disrupts LANA function and KSHV latency
to drive tumorigenesis. Together these studies provide an integrated framework to further advance our
knowledge of KSHV infection and latency, and provide new opportunities for therapeutic intervention in KSHV-
associated disease."

PROJECT SUMMARY
This Administrative Core will provide oversight and management of the Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities
Research Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn).
The center has three specific aims. First, we will lead an innovative, translational research agenda by supporting
cores that continually evolve to provide cutting-edge technologies and meet the needs of center members. The
center also supports a new research project that uses most of these cores to determine if
magnetoencephalography (MEG) can be used to predict general cognitive ability and language-specific ability in
children with a genetic risk for intellectual disability. Second, we will lead a career development initiative that
supports multidisciplinary training. Third, we will promote interactions and collaboration, advocate for IDD
research and its growth at CHOP/Penn and beyond, and we will ensure that advances in IDD research are rapidly
disseminated to a wide variety of scientific and lay audiences with a focus on families of children with IDDs.
The Administrative Core oversees management, strategy and vision for the IDDRC. It will: (1) Provide oversight
of the cores including review and approval of new users, review of utilization, and survey user satisfaction; (2)
Provide oversight of the research project, including regular progress meetings; (3) Provide oversight of core
budget and monitoring their of cost-effectiveness; (4) Manage all training related activities, including organizing
seminar series; (5) Maintain websites for the IDDRC and our training programs; (6) Coordinate meetings with
internal, external, and patient advisory groups; (7) Manage all communication with NICHD; (8) Foster
collaborations with other IDDRCs across the network; (9) Lead institutional, regional, and national advocacy; (10)
Disseminate research findings to academic and community/family organizations and stakeholders; and (11)
Organize activities that encourage networking and collaboration between cores, among center members, and
with other centers and resources at CHOP/Penn.
The center has three guiding principles. First, we seek to foster community, to encourage collaborative, inter-
disciplinary research and to attract the next generation of scientists to the field. Second, solicit advice from our
advisory committees to help the center continually evolve so that we meet the needs of our users and our
community of constituents. Finally, we emphasize support of innovative, translational research that will define
the etiology/pathophysiology of IDDs and lead to new interventions for children and adults with
neurodevelopmental disabilities. Collectively, our activities are sharply focused on supporting research that has
the potential to greatly impact the lives of those with an IDD."
10916243,"(CORE B- CTC: CLINICAL TRANSLATIONAL CORE)
PROJECT SUMMARY
Description: The Clinical Translational Core (CTC) provides a comprehensive set of services designed to
enhance the impact and rigor of clinical translational research on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities
(IDD). Select services are novel and unavailable outside of the CTC; other services increase research efficiency
and enhance quality control over study activities common to all CT research. Freeing individual IDDRC users of
the burden of common activities in turn allows users to better deploy resources for innovation and maximizing
the impact of their translational science. CTC services fall into four areas: (1) Assistance with assembling suitably
large study cohorts to support rigorous, well-powered research. Recruitment of large samples is necessary for
studies of developmental disabilities which have diverse clinical manifestations that must be measured and
controlled for in data analyses to garner reproducible results. (2) Creation of study specific interactive databases
and visualization tools which allow labs to track their study progress, efficiently allocate resources and effort, and
prepare study reports and data submissions (e.g., NIMH Data Archive). The CTC, in collaboration with the
Genomics and Data Integration and Neuroimaging and Neurocircuitry cores, support integration of different data
types. (3) Support all phases of IRB and IND protocol preparation, submission and response to stipulations; and
provide concierge services for other freely available research supports already on campus, such as services
offered by CHOP’s Clinical Trials office, and services provided by the Penn/CHOP Clinical and Translational
Science Award (CTSA). (4) Expert clinical assessment support, including support with conventional
psychological measurement; computable phenotypes from bioinformatic analyses of the electronic health
records (EHR); and novel digital phenotyping using computer vision and computational linguistics to achieve
granular measurement of speech, language and observable behaviors (e.g., nonverbal facial expressions and
synchrony between individuals during interactions). These technologies and analytic capabilities are especially
valued as they are not otherwise available on campus or commercially. The CTC will partner with the Preclinical
Models Core on computer vision measurement of animal and human behaviors (e.g., gait), to derive features for
mapping across species in order to more rapidly translate study findings and validate promising treatments.
Relevance to IDDRC Mission: The CTC facilitates interdisciplinary translational research and training in IDDs
(e.g., by working closely with the Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Related Disabilities (LEND)
program). The CTC provides centralized resources as well as novel cutting-edge techniques to support and
advance IDD research linking genes, brain and behavior. The CTC is integral to advancing science that will
impact the lives of those with an intellectual and/or developmental disability.
Eligibility: Services are available to approved users of the CHOP/Penn IDDRC and for cross-site collaborations
with others within the IDDRC network."

for IDDRC users desiring support in quantitative experimental design, biostatistics, and informatics techniques
with particular emphasis on machine learning. The Core has substantive expertise in areas represented by two
sub-cores (1) Biostatistics, with faculty from the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology & Informatics at the
University of Pennsylvania (PENN) supporting experimental design of basic science, clinical trials and
observational studies and the analysis of the ensuing data (2) Informatics and machine learning, with faculty
from the Department of Biomedical Health Informatics at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), providing
support for high-level data integration of ‘omics’ data along with interpretation, classification and predictive
modelling. A third sub-core will support Career Development and Education. Core members are committed
mentors and teachers. Dr. Mary Putt, Professor of Biostatistics and former Associate Vice-Chair of the Graduate
Group in Epidemiology & Biostatistics and Program Chair of the Biostatistics graduate program, is the overall
Core Director and Director of the Biostatistics Sub-Core. Dr. Kai Wang, Associate Professor of Biomedical
Health Informatics at CHOP and Pathology (PENN) and, and Senior Fellow of the Institute for Biomedical
Informatics, is Associate Director of the Informatics & Machine Learning Sub-Core. Dr. Rui Xiao, Associate
Professor of Biostatistics, and Pediatrics, is Associate Director of the Career Development & Education Sub-
Core
Relevance to IDDRC Mission: The BDSC supports the overall themes of our IDDRC, specifically (1) impactful
research into the cause and treatment of conditions related to intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) and
(2) career development and education of a new generation of IDD researchers. The BDSC evolved out of the
previous Biostatistics & Bioinformatics core; it interacts with and/or complements the activities of the other IDDRC
Cores as well as the Research Project. The Biostatistics faculty (Drs. Putt and Xiao) from this well-established
core have joined forces with colleague, Dr. Kai Wang, expert in Informatics and Machine Learning to form the
new Biostatistics & Data Science core. The Biostatistics faculty, through long association with the IDDRC, are
integrated into multiple domains of IDD biomedical research, from basic science to clinical and translational
medicine. Dr. Wang, through his expertise in machine learning and other informatics approaches, his recently
established collaborations with IDDRC members and extensive experience in brain disorders, adds a new and
exciting angle to the new generation of big data analytics and training.
Eligibility: These services are available both to approved users of the IDDRC at Children’s Hospital of
Philadelphia/University of Pennsylvania (CHOP/PENN) and to users at Centers throughout the IDDRC Network."
10916255,"(CORE D- GDIC: GENOMICS AND DATA INTEGRATION CORE)
PROJECT SUMMARY
Description: The Genomics and Data Integration Core (GDIC) provides comprehensive and expert analytic
guidance, sequencing, and informatics tools for IDDRC users who require support in genomic project planning,
data generation, analyses, interpretation, and informatics integration with complex data types and sources to
directly facilitate end-user research analyses and discovery. The core has three components: [1] The Genomic
Sequencing Service supports generation and expert informatician-based analysis of nucleotide sequences
obtained from either nuclear or mitochondrial DNA or RNA, including those taken from single cells and IPSCs.
This service is directed by Dr. Hakon Hakonarson, an internationally recognized pioneer in the use of genome-
wide mapping to understand the causes of IDD. [2] The Genomic Data Bioinformatics Resources & Variant
Analysis Education Service provides users with access to MITOMAP/MITOMASTER and MSeqDR, Web
toolkits in order to enable self-analysis of genetic variants in both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. These
toolkits, developed by Drs. Douglas Wallace and Marni Falk, enjoy broad recognition as essential instruments
for understanding the genetics of mitochondrial disease. This service leverages CHOP resources that were used
to support the Mitochondrial Medicine Frontier Program and the Center for Mitochondrial and Epigenomic
Medicine. [3] The Complex Data Integration and Visualization Service provides access to a custom ‘IDDRC-
Tableau’ data integration platform that accelerates research discovery by facilitating compilation, integration,
visualization, and direct query of complex genetic and phenotypic data directly collated and modeled from diverse
sources, including the electronic medical record. This service is particularly useful for review of cohort-level
data, enabling outcome measure and subject selection for natural history studies and clinical trial development.
Relevance to IDDRC Mission: The GDIC has been developed with careful attention to the overall theme of our
IDDRC – “Genes, Brain and Behavior”. This encompasses efforts to understand developmental disabilities in
three inter-related domains: (a) The genetic anlage which causes and/or modulates essentially all developmental
disabilities; (b) The biochemical and neurophysiologic alterations which arise from genetic factors; and (c) The
aberrant behaviors that we associate with these genetic and neurophysiologic changes, and which we recognize
as the phenotypes of developmental disabilities. The GDIC provides analytical support for multiple domains of
biomedical research, from basic science to clinical translational medicine. The GDIC will facilitate detailed
understanding of the genetic etiology across both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of intellectual and
developmental disabilities (IDD). It will also provide researchers with access to a sophisticated informatics
platform that will allow them to directly discover the phenotypic consequences of genetic alterations and identify
therapeutic opportunities across targeted translational or clinical research cohorts. Overall, our goal is to make
this world-class genomic data generation and analytics expertise available to all IDDRC users."
10916263,"(CORE E- NNC: NEUROIMAGING AND NEUROCIRCUITRY CORE)
PROJECT SUMMARY
Description: The Neuroimaging and Neurocircuitry Core (NNC) enables the study of changes in brain circuitry
which occur in people with IDD. The Core supports research in both patients and animal models by providing
users the following state-of-the-art technologies: (a) Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings of brain
activity; (b) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) studies of brain structure and function;
(c) Multiphoton, confocal, and epifluorescence microscopic imaging studies of the dynamics of neuronal circuit
function; (d) Patch clamp recording studies in neurons; and (e) Electroencephalographic (EEG) and other in vivo
recordings. Analyses are performed in affected human patients with IDD, in Preclinical animal models of IDD,
and in vitro (stem cells and tissue culture). Core Directors provide users with access to a wide set of otherwise
inaccessible neuronal circuit assessment techniques, as well as expert consultation regarding experimental
design and analysis. In all core functions, emphasis is placed upon quality control. In addition to assuring that all
studies are competently conducted and appropriately analyzed, the Core Directors assist users to design studies
that are properly controlled, adequately powered, and, when feasible, conducted in a blinded fashion.
Relevance to IDDRC Mission: The overarching theme of this IDDRC is “Genes, Brain & Behavior” (see
Overview). This Core focuses on each of these overlapping domains. Genetic alterations underlie many IDDs,
and result in aberrant protein expression, which alters basic brain synaptic and circuit function. This in turn
generates the behavioral anomalies which constitute IDD. The study of patients and animal models brings the
genetic components into sharp focus, and the NNC facilitates examination into how these genetic changes alter
brain function and, subsequently, whether such changes are correlated to behavior. Thus, the goal of the Core
is to quantify the changes in function of neuronal circuits which result from genetic mutation and variation.
Elucidating the changes in dynamic function of neuronal circuitry responsible for the generation of the atypical
behaviors collectively termed the IDD is critical in translational efforts to provide diagnostic and prognostic
biological markers (biomarkers) as well as biologically-based indices to serve as stratification biomarkers for
clinical trial enrichment and response monitoring with the ultimate goal of developing better therapies to treat
and cure brain pathologies underlying the IDDs and other related CNS disorders such as autism, epilepsy, and
cerebral palsy.
Eligibility: These services are available both to approved users of the IDDRC at CHOP/UPenn and to users at
other Centers in the nationwide Network."
10916275,"(CORE F – PMC: PRECLINICAL MODELS CORE)
PROJECT SUMMARY
Description: The Preclinical Models Core (PMC) supports IDDRC users who study IDD pathophysiology and/or
seek new treatments for IDD using one or both of the following preclinical models: (1) Rodent models: This Core
component assists users with the characterization of behavioral phenotypes in mouse models of genetic or
acquired disabilities. Major behavioral domains assessed in this core include: learning, memory, social
preference, communication, motor function, and affective disorder-related behaviors; (2) Human iPSC models:
This Core component assists users to create cell models of IDD by generating induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) using standard reprogramming technologies or by genome editing via CRISPR-Cas9 on established
iPSC lines, followed by differentiation into neural cell types of interest for molecular and cellular phenotype
characterization. These cells, some derived from humans with IDDs, provide a model in which it is possible to
scrutinize molecular and cellular consequences of genetic disease and to evaluate the efficacy of possible
therapies. The complementary model systems are being used by many of the center investigators, and the two
services interact closely under one leadership.
The PMC emphasizes training of users and their staff. Trained users can continue studies in their own laboratory,
or they can utilize the equipment and/or reagents in the PMC at reduced cost. The services offered by the PMC
are complementary to those offered by all of the other center cores, and users frequently use more than one
core to complete a project. In addition, the PMC interacts closely with similar cores at sister IDDRCs to share
protocols, cross-validate outcome measures, in order to improve rigor and reproducibility across the IDDRC
network.
Relevance to IDDRC Mission: The PMC bridges all three domains of “Genes, Brain, and Behavior”, the theme
of the CHOP/Penn IDDRC (see Research Plan Overall). The Core was developed in response to a user survey
in 2014 that emphasized a need for an IDD-focused facility to study IDD-related behavioral and cellular
phenotypes in the context of IDD clinical symptoms and to take advantage of the iPSC potentials to gain insights
into disease pathophysiology and improve treatment for IDDs in a collaborative manner with other Cores of this
IDDRC.
Eligibility: These services are available both to approved users of the IDDRC at CHOP/Penn and to users at
other Centers in the Network."
10916285,"(RESEARCH PROJECT- EARLY PREDICTORS OF COGNITIVE/LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT)
PROJECT SUMMARY
This project aims to identify electrophysiological markers (using magnetoencephalography, MEG) that predict
future intellectual ability in infants and toddlers at risk for intellectual and developmental disability (IDD). To this
end, we will use a suite of MEG paradigms developed in the previous IDDRC cycle that show differential
sensitivity to general cognitive and language-specific ability. Paradigms focus on assessment of primary (pure
tones) through higher-order (lexical access) auditory cortex activity. With the obtained auditory cortex neural
measures used (singly and combined) we will predict future functional status (cognitive and language). Infant-
optimized versions of these paradigms are applied to infants at genetic risk of a subsequent intellectual disability
diagnosis. Hence, we hypothesize that early assessment of electrophysiological activity in at-risk infants will not
only quantitatively indicate the degree of risk but will also predict and specify the nature of impairment. Given
that most clinical diagnoses of intellectual disability are not made until at least school-age years, an accelerated
longitudinal design is invoked. First, an Infant phase studies babies at 6, 12 and then 18 months in an attempt
to predict functional status at 36 months. A simultaneously recruited Preschool phase recruits toddlers at age 3
years with similar genetic diagnoses (at-risk for IDD) to predict functional outcome assessment obtained at age
6 years. Via this research design, the interim functional follow-up of 3 year olds initially scanned as 6, 12 and
18-month infants can be better interpreted with respect to prediction of outcome at age 6 years. Through serial
MEG examination, instantaneous (e.g., 6, 12 or 18 months) assessments as well as developmental trajectories
(6- to 12- to 18-month interval change) are interrogated for their predictive value. With respect to innovation,
given the temporal and spatial resolution of brain activity that is almost unique to MEG, MEG is poised to greatly
enhance our understanding of normal and abnormal infant and toddler brain development. Specially, in addition
to noted use of exams that directly target a range of primary/secondary auditory cortex neural processes,
analyses that provide measures of brain activity in source space allow for focused assessment of activity at brain
regions of a priori interest versus examining a composite measure of whole-brain activity. It is anticipated that
early repeated assessment of brain activity of infants at risk for an IDD diagnosis will provide actionable
information to parents and caregivers and, where needed, allow earlier tailored interventions."
10897257,"The Administrative Core is the nucleus of the IDDRC, providing scientific, administrative, and fiscal leadership,
and high quality, cost-effective core services, in a strongly collaborative spirit. The core functions to create a
highly visible and comprehensive center that systematically integrates all aspects of research, training, clinical
services, and outreach in the field of IDD at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and serves as the liaison to
the NIH, and national and international organizations. Chang and the previous director, Messing, have raised
considerable private funds for improvement of IDDRC physical facilities, purchase of scientific equipment for
IDDRC cores, program development, and recruitment and retention of investigators. Specific Aim 1 is to develop
new and coordinate existing scientific resources to strategically support the research of IDDRC investigators.
IDDRC core resources and services have been designed to complement UW-Madison resources to enhance
the scientific work involving all phases of the translational research cycle, from basic discovery to clinical
application. The Administrative Core’s leadership team (Executive Committee) gathers information about
research needs from surveys of investigators as well as from each core’s user advisory committee, internal and
external advisory committees, consultants, and visiting scientists. To obtain additional resources, the
Administrative Core works closely with UW-Madison administration including the Office of the Vice Chancellor
for Research and Graduate Education, academic deans, department chairs, center directors, and directors of
other relevant research units. Specific Aim 2 is to promote interdisciplinary and collaborative research in high
priority areas of IDD. This includes provision of start-up funds to attract faculty to the Waisman Center, allocation
of support for special interest groups that involve IDDRC faculty from multiple disciplines who share a common
area of focus (e.g., Down syndrome, genome editing in human pluripotent stem cells, functional genomics),
provision of seed money support for groups of investigators who seek to develop multi-component grant
applications for interdisciplinary IDD research (e.g. our signature research project), funding for speakers in the
John Wiley Seminar Series, and most importantly the creation of an environment of mutual respect for diverse
disciplinary approaches to studying IDD conditions. Ultimately, the Administrative Core of the Waisman Center
IDDRC seeks to create a nexus where multiple angles of vision are focused on a shared commitment to
understanding the causes and consequences of, and discovering treatments for IDD conditions. Specific Aim
3 is to further connect research and clinical activities and strengthen community partnerships for efficient
dissemination of knowledge and best practices to improve the lives of individuals and families affected by IDD.
The Administrative Core not only facilitates interactions between research and clinical activities within the Center,
but also works to engage individuals and families affected by IDD throughout the UW health care system and in
community settings such as the public schools. The Core nurtures and maintains the relationships with key
campus partners, with the Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation, with All of Us, and with state partners such
as the Department of Health Services. The core develops and maintains close connections with parent and
patient groups as wells as agencies and organization active in the field of IDD."

technologies and resources to facilitate translation of basic science discoveries to the clinical setting, treatment
development, clinical trials, and community practice. Indeed, the Waisman Center has always focused on
clinical and translational research as one of the IDDRCs that contains a UCEDD (University Center of
Excellence in Developmental Disabilities), including eleven diagnostic and treatment clinics operated in
partnership with the two adjoining hospitals of the UW Health system and an inclusive model preschool
program-the Waisman Early Childhood Program (WECP). Our history of interactions between research and
clinical services continues to the present with studies of assessments, treatments, and interventions in
conditions such as traumatic brain injury, blindness, Down syndrome, and autism spectrum disorder. Our Core
incorporates new technologies and resources in biomedical research and serves as a focal point for cost-
effective and innovative translational research related to intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) on
our campus. The CTC has strong expertise in addressing challenges facing investigators who conduct
behavioral and bio-behavioral research on IDD populations. Such populations present challenges to
recruitment, require diagnostic evaluations by professionals with highly specialized training, and often involve
assessment via innovative measurement strategies designed to focus specifically on the construct of interest
and accessible to individuals with various types of disabilities; thus, linkages between basic, clinical and
community applications of research in this area are critical. The CTC assists investigators with these and other
challenges in the areas of recruitment, assessment, and behavioral methods development and applications.
The CTC was dramatically enhanced within the last year by the development and implementation of a biobank
to collect, store and make accessible for research biospecimens, clinical data, and health information from
individuals with IDD. We have expanded our clinical research coordination and navigation services and we
have upgraded our audio/video recording equipment for our behavioral testing suites. In response to COVID-
19, we have increased our clinical assessment and custom application services to support innovations needed
for virtual data collection. Our specific aims for the next project period are to provide (1) support recruitment of
human participants and provide access to data/specimens for behavioral, biobehavioral, and biomedical
research and clinical trials, including capacity for cGMP biomanufacturing; (2) provide research coordination
and navigation services; (3) provide specialized clinical assessments of individuals with IDD; and (4) provide

10897269,"The IDD Models Core is designed to foster development and analysis of human stem cell and
rodent models of IDD conditions. The core supports basic science studies of molecular pathways
and cellular interactions that are altered in genetic and epigenetic disorders affecting nervous
system function. In addition, the core enables drug and biomarker studies, as well as preclinical
studies that are aimed at developing novel translational approaches to IDD. A historic strength of
the IDD Models core is the use of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-based models, which
include both patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their modification by
genome editing, to study diverse types of IDD conditions. The core has incorporated novel
approaches to meet the increased demands for rigor and reproducibility by meeting
international/peer institution standards in the creation and characterization of patient-specific
iPSCs and hESCs. The refined gene editing capabilities develop innovative cellular tools for
sophisticated analysis of altered nervous system development and function. These models also
provide the means to evaluate candidate therapeutics in disorder-relevant cells, as well as
develop novel screens to identify promising compounds in small- and large-scale library
screening. The core also empowers analysis of rodent models of IDD conditions, not only by
providing support for their creation, but also by providing a comprehensive and cutting edge
behavioral testing service. The service incorporates a battery of cognitive/nervous system
analyses under the supervision of a skilled core manager to ensure the rigor and reproducibility

analyze human stem cell models of IDD; and (2) to create and analyze rodent models of IDD.
Recognizing that sophisticated analysis of these models is required to elucidate pathogenesis
and novel therapeutic approaches, the IDD Models Core uses extensive on-site research
resources and leverages an extended network of complementary research cores on the UW-
Madison campus to provide the infrastructure and skilled personnel that support integrated
analysis at molecular, genomic, epigenomic, cellular, electrophysiological, and behavioral levels.
Assembly of these diverse resources is designed to broaden the scope and depth of IDD model
studies and to facilitate progress of IDD research from basic science to translational studies."
10897274,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) frequently co-occurs with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Individuals with ASD have a 22 times greater risk of having ADHD compared with those without ASD, and recent
evidence suggests that ASD co-occurs with ADHD at a higher rate than with any other mental health disorder.
The negative impact of this co-occurrence on the individual is substantial; those presenting with both disorders
(ASD/+ADHD) show lower cognitive functioning, more severe social impairment, and greater delays in adaptive
functioning than individuals presenting with ASD without ADHD (ASD/-ADHD). The overall rationale of this
proposal is that a multidisciplinary integration of genomic, neuroimaging, behavioral, human stem cell, and
machine learning approaches may reveal key insights into the mechanisms underlying the debilitating and
common co-occurrence of ASD/+ADHD in children. The overall objective of the proposed work is to identify the
etiological mechanisms underlying ASD/-ADHD and ASD/+ADHD. We hypothesize that children with
ASD/+ADHD will have unique genetic, molecular, cellular, brain structural, and neurobehavioral features
compared to children with ASD/-ADHD. This hypothesis will be tested through four specific aims: 1) to identify
prospective longitudinal behavioral and neuroimaging predictors of ASD/+ADHD compared to ASD/-ADHD; 2)
to characterize molecular and cellular features of neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) generated from individuals with ASD/-ADHD and ASD/+ADHD; 3) to identify and quantify the
overlapping genetic architectures for ASD and ADHD; and 4) to develop a machine learning model integrating
multi-modal data to predict ASD/-ADHD and ASD/+ADHD. Innovations of the proposed study include the
application of state-of-the-art neuroimaging (optimized to facilitate brain imaging in difficult-to-scan populations),
a prospective longitudinal design (to account for individual differences in the developmental course of ADHD
symptoms as children with ASD age), iPSCs (to identify distinct cellular and molecular profiles), novel statistical
methods for multi-phenotype modeling and gene identification, and an innovative multiview machine learning
approach that integrates multi-modal data to identify the functional genomic elements and gene regulatory
networks that underlie the emergence of ASD/+ADHD. This project is highly responsive to the IDDRC RFA, as
it involves comprehensive -omic approaches to markedly increase our understanding of more than a single IDD
condition to improve diagnosis and to facilitate future biomarker development. The knowledge gained will be
significant because it can be used to inform a far more powerful multi-modal assessment of ASD and ADHD that
integrates behavioral observations with technically advanced (but highly feasible) biological assays. These
findings will have important implications for early screening and diagnosis of ASD and ADHD and will provide
distinct biology-based targets for future biomarker development."
10880561,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Given the complexity of the heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) syndrome, there is a major
unmet need to create a comprehensive, resource that can integrate a wide variety of disparate data sources for
consumption by the greater scientific community. A relatively “siloed” approach to scientific investigation in
HFpEF has not resulted in therapeutic advances thus far; therefore, we must pivot to new approaches, including
wider sharing of de-identified data to researchers worldwide to allow for a greater number of novel investigations
using the data. For these reasons, a major advance in the clinical investigation of HFpEF will be the development
of an effective HeartShare Data Portal that capitalizes on the NHLBI BioData Catalyst resource; aggregates,
organizes and curates HeartShare data; and rapidly makes de-identified data available for analysis by qualified
investigators around the world. The NHLBI BioData Catalyst resource is ideally suited for the tasks of the
HeartShare program because it promotes findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR-ness),
data democratization, robust search/analysis tools, cloud-based computing, and integration with the Trans-
Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program. It will also support NHLBI’s Strategic Vision objective of
leveraging emerging opportunities in data science in order to open new frontiers in HFpEF investigation. We
propose the following specific aims to accomplish the goals of the HeartShare Data Portal core: (1) To create a
comprehensive web-based HeartShare data portal that uses the existing infrastructure of the NHLBI BioData
Catalyst and is accessible to the research community, provides data storage/access and analytic tools, and
supports online phenotype/omics visualization. (2) To integrate data across an ecosystem of diverse datasets
and data resources applicable to HeartShare, including cohort data, clinical trial data, multi-omics data, EHR
data (including integration via the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard with Center for
Medicare and Medicaid Services and private insurer data), research testing, biomarkers, and an online repository
of de-identified images (e.g., echocardiograms, MRI scans, ECG tracings). (3) To create a comprehensive
patient engagement resource (web- and mobile-based platforms) using the Eureka platform to allow for (1)
remote consenting and completion of forms, (2) a communication portal for participants (with the ability for
patients to view their own individual data and test results, and aggregate HeartShare summary data); and data
collection for home devices, sensors, and mobile health applications."

center studies, to facilitate multi-dimensional, multi-omics analyses (including machine learning/artificial
intelligence) for the entire HeartShare program. The HeartShare Data Management Core includes a highly
integrated team of individuals from a variety of disciplines with expertise in data coordinating center operations,
statistics, machine learning, omics, and HFpEF. These experts will work in concert to achieve the following
specific aims: (1) to develop procedures and standards for data pooling, cleaning, and harmonization of all data
from cohorts and trials; compile the data as a shared resource for the research community; and host these data
on BioData Catalyst as part of the retrospective component of HeartShare; (2) to integrate self-reported data,
home monitoring data from mobile health (mHealth) technologies, environmental data, electronic health record
(EHR) data (including natural language processing [NLP] techniques), deep phenotyping data, and outcome
data into a core data resource for the prospective component of HeartShare; (3) to create integrated biorepository
and imaging repository resources; coordinate these resources with TOPMed; and facilitate automated deep
learning analyses of images relevant to HeartShare; and (4) plan and facilitate advanced analytics (multi-omics
and machine learning analyses) to identify HFpEF subtypes and the pathobiological basis underlying these
subtypes. The Data Management Core will also ensure efficient visualization, reporting, and communication of
findings; and we will work with BioData Catalyst experts in our Data Portal Core to transition publicly available
data into cloud storage, implement governance within BioData Catalyst, and make tools and workflows cloud
compatible."
10880568,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The Northwestern HeartShare Data Translation Center (DTC), leverages processes, personnel, and
infrastructure from the Northwestern University (NU) Data Analysis and Coordinating Center (NUDACC), to have
the staffing, equipment, and other resources available to ensure that the Administrative and Outreach Core
meets its goals of (1) designing, implementing, and integrating the HeartShare program components; (2)
coordinating and optimizing the data ascertainment from the electronic health records (EHRs) at the HeartShare
Clinical Centers (CCs); (3) ensuring successful enrollment and retention of heart failure (HF) patients and
controls for the prospective component of HeartShare; (4) supporting a call center and integrating with the Eureka
platform, which will facilitate acquisition of mobile health data and contact with patients; (5) providing consistency
and standardization of data acquisition across the CCs and establishing core laboratories; and (6) developing a
Research Skills Program, which will be modeled after Northwestern’s innovative Computer Science-X (CS-X)
Program, which has successfully bridged the divide between cardiology fellows and post-doctoral data scientists
via integration with Northwestern Bluhm Cardiovascular Institute’s Center for Artificial Intelligence in
Cardiovascular Medicine Fellowship Program. The HeartShare DTC Administrative and Outreach Core also
leverages the resources of the Institute for Augmented Intelligence in Medicine (I.AIM) at Northwestern. The
HeartShare Administrative/Outreach Core is designed to complete the following specific aims. (1) To design,
implement, and coordinate the HeartShare program components to ensure the successful completion of the
retrospective and prospective aspects of the program. We aim to provide guidance to sites and monitor metrics
for HFpEF patient enrollment, engagement, and retention; ensure data consistency and standardization across
sites; and provide administrative, financial, and scientific leadership of HeartShare. (2) To create a state-of-the-
art HeartShare Call Center integrated with the Eureka platform that will facilitate acquisition of mobile health
data, outside records, and longitudinal contact with patients, which will be essential for developing a
comprehensive HeartShare data repository and will facilitate longitudinal follow-up. (3) To create an innovative
Research Skills Program that will provide high-quality mentoring and synergy for early-stage clinical investigators
and data scientists using the successful Northwestern CS-X program as a blueprint."
10848405,"The Administrative Core (AC) will provide the scientific vision and governance structure necessary to develop
and implement the Johns Hopkins Artificial Intelligence and Technology Collaboratory (AITC). The aims are to
provide the interdisciplinary leadership and governance structure to the AITC, to administer and organize the
processes of the AITC, to facilitate the identification of new AI/Tech relevant for use in the developing new
products that will improve the health and wellbeing of older adults, to maintain documents, reports and records,
and to organize and conduct scientific sessions related to science and technology emanating from this AITC.
The AC will be led by the AITC Co-Principal Investigators, who have the relevant interdisciplinary scientific and
clinical expertise, leadership and business development experience, as well as the broad institutional
knowledge necessary to facilitate the goals of this AITC. They will work closely with a program manager and
administrative staff, other Core Directors, and an expert Advisory Committee to develop and promote the
research and product development agenda of this AITC. An experienced External Advisory Panel will also be
named and provide direct programmatic feedback to the AC leadership team. This core will facilitate the
organization of national calls for pilot proposals on an annual basis. It will also seek regular input from
institutional and national leaders who represent aging-focused clinical medicine and research, Alzheimer's
disease research and clinical practice, business and venture capital leaders, and stakeholders and their family
members. The AC will also work to ensure that underserved rural and urban populations are included in all
aspects of this AITC. This core will also work closely with the AITC coordinating center to maintain a living
textbook of content coming from this and other AITCs. In summary, the AC will provide the vision, leadership
and management functions of the AITC through the development and maintenance of a focused and
interdisciplinary program of AI and technology development focused on improving the health and well-being of
older adults. It will assure that this AITC contributes significantly to the development of aging and AD-relevant
AI and technology advances, and will help to assure that these developments are moved into products that
improve the health and well-being of older adults."
10848407,"Stakeholder engagement is key to patient-centered care. It is particularly relevant to this proposal since
stakeholder engagement can help ensure accountability and equity and avoid unintended consequences as we
develop and integrate novel technology to improve the care and health of older adults. Stakeholder
engagement is also relevant since many of the decisions older adults, especially those with dementia, face are
preference-sensitive and inherently dependent on the patient perspective.
The goal of Stakeholder Engagement Core for the AITC is to assemble and elicit input from a diverse set of
stakeholders to inform all phases of the AITC project. Stakeholders include older adults, caregivers, clinicians,
other health professionals, researchers, health system leaders, health informatics experts, technology
develops, investors, and policymakers. We will use multiple synergistic and rigorous methods to engage with
these diverse categories of stakeholders. In Aim 1, we will establish a Stakeholder Engagement Council
comprising of 10-12 older adults, caregivers, clinicians and health professionals who are the most direct end-users
of the products that the AITC aims to develop. The Stakeholder Engagement Council will provide
ongoing input throughout the AITC project period including needs assessment, feedback during prototype
development and feasibility testing, development of pilot grant solicitations and review of pilot grant proposals,
support for pilot projects' stakeholder engagement efforts, input to networking and dissemination activities, and
input to the design, content, and conduct of Aim 2's phase-specific, more targeted stakeholder engagement
activities. Aim 2 includes more focused stakeholder engagement activities tailored to the different phrases of
the AITC project. Specifically we will use environmental scan and needs assessment to identify technology
needs, to use various feedback elicitation sessions (focus groups, interviews, questionnaires) to elicit input on
feasibility and acceptability of products during technology development and testing. Lastly, we will organize a
variety of forums including community workshops, town hall demonstrations and leverage national conferences
to help disseminate the developed technology to community members, researchers, and technology
developers/investors. Aim 3 focuses on the AITC goal of being a national resource and will establish
infrastructure, support, and training for pilot grantees to engage stakeholder in their own projects.
This Core includes a multi-disciplinary team with extensive experience in stakeholder engagement. We will
work cohesively with the other AITC Cores to elicit and integrate important stakeholder perspectives to inform
all key activities of the AITC."
10909935,"Project Summary/Abstract: During the past 6 years, our study team investigated the neural mechanism of
typically-occurring convergence insufficiency (TYP-CI), the most common binocular vision disorder in children
and young adults (3.4% to 12.7%5–11) leading to 20 publications12–31 with 4 more in review and 6 in preparation.
We conducted the only randomized clinical trial (RCT) integrating objective eye movement and fMRI outcome
measures, achieving 100% planned enrollment and retention of 100 young adults.28 Our results localized the
reduction in functional activity for TYP-CI compared to controls within the oculomotor vermis (OVM) and the
cuneus. Functional activity in the OVM and cuneus was significantly correlated to convergence peak velocity
providing the first mechanistic identification of these deficits that create significant burden to those afflicted. 23
Our longitudinal results discovered that the neural mechanistic change stimulated by office-based vergence
/accommodative therapy (OBVAT) is an increase in the frontal eye field (FEF) and thalamus functional activity.
Increased functional activity from the FEF and thalamus significantly correlates to convergence peak
velocity. 23,32,33
Results are leading to personalized point-of-care therapies remediating the debilitating
symptoms for TYP-CI patients. While our research and results of other RCTs show that OBVAT is the most
effective treatment for remediating symptoms and improving vision function in both TYP-CI children 34–36 and
adults, 37,38 none of these participants had a history of head injury, a pathology that has been linked to CI. Our
research team has demonstrated that the prevalence of CI is higher (38% to 49%) in children 39,40 and
adults 41,42 with persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS-CI), than in the non-concussed population.
Currently, there is no validated treatment for PPCS-CI. This difference in prevalence, mode of onset
(longstanding versus sudden onset), and severity of the condition has led to a debate about whether the
diagnostic and management procedures effective for TYP-CI should be utilized for PPCS-CI, and strongly
suggests that new research is needed to optimize PPCS-CI management. We are uniquely positioned to
provide answers to these questions by building on our work establishing the neurofunctional mechanism of
TYP-CI and OBVAT administered to TYP-CI. Such research is of great importance because PPCS-CI is
associated with debilitating visual symptoms impacting the return to school/sports, 43–47 work, 48–51 or driving. 52
We have identified three significant gaps for the treatment of PPCS-CI that must be addressed to determine its
most effective management. First, given the obvious differences in etiology, are there significant differences
between TYP-CI and PPCS-CI related to objective eye movement measures (peak velocity, final amplitude,
and repeatability) due to underlying neural mechanistic differences? Second, what is the underlying neural
mechanism of OBVAT for PPCS-CI compared to TYP-CI? Third, how effective is OBVAT for PPCS-CI and is
the dosage of administration different than TYP-CI? This renewal addresses these gaps in clinical science."

The mission of the annual WAFDO Annual Educational Conference (AEC) is to provide a
venue, either virtually or in-person, where public health field practitioners and program
managers, industry leaders, and academia from across the region can interact and share ideas
while receiving information on current trends and emerging issues impacting public health and
safety related to human and animal food, drugs, cosmetics, and medical products. The AEC
agenda typically includes presentations that will give participants an opportunity to learn about
state, local, national and international perspectives on all of these important public health and
consumer safety topics.
The annual WAFDO Conference is one of the most comprehensive and cost effective
educational opportunities in the Western region (Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii,
Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, British Columbia,
Alberta, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and Mexico) that addresses the range of current
public health issues facing federal, state and local regulatory programs. WAFDO keeps the cost
of the conference as low as possible in an effort to allow access to the conference to the widest
range of participants. The low cost of the conference enables public health professionals from
all levels of the regulatory community, industry and academia to participate.
The goal and objective of this application is to successfully apply for $25,000 a year for five
years (2021-2026 project period, $125,000 total award) under the FDA Support for Conferences
and Scientific Meetings (PAR-19-306) announcement so that WAFDO can:
 Provide a high quality, comprehensive virtual conference for its 2021 annual educational
conference.
 Provide financial assistance for attendees to travel to future annual educational
 conferences (2022-2025) who might not otherwise be able to travel due to budget
 limitations or travel restrictions.
 Provide attendees with appropriate printed materials and other conference resources.
 Fund conference room and audio-visual equipment costs for the conference.
The 2021 WAFDO AEC will be held in a virtual environment due to the prospect of ongoing
COVID gathering and travel restrictions. This application assumes that future annual
conferences starting in 2022 will be able to be held in person with no COVID or travel
restrictions in place. If this assumption is false, WAFDO will utilize any awarded funds to defray
costs associated with additional virtual deliveries.
The annual educational conference will contribute to the sharing and discussion of current
human and animal food, drug, cosmetic, and medical product safety topics in order to further
mutual reliance between fellow public health entities and therefore move closer to a fully
integrated public health and safety system."
10703709,"Project Summary
Towards the end of nervous system development, neural circuits are extremely plastic. Small perturbations
during this time can cause lifelong circuit and behavioral changes. Not surprisingly, mounting evidence suggests
that several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy, have origins in
defective late neural circuit formation. During this late stage, neural circuits refinement takes place, and
components of the mature behavior gradually appear. As this occurs, stimulus-independent bursts of activity
sweep through neuronal populations. This type of activity, known as spontaneous network activity (SNA), has
been characterized in vertebrate systems where it refines neural connections to generate sensory maps and
establish local circuits. However, we know surprisingly little about the molecular mechanisms by which SNA is
initiated, how it functions, and how it ultimately underpins behavior. This proposal establishes the developing
Drosophila larval locomotor system as a genetically tractable model, with a wealth of knowledge on early stages
of neurodevelopment and circuit function, where these questions can be tackled. We combine genetic and
systems neuroscience techniques to gain new understanding into SNA function during late circuit formation. This
proposal has three goals. (1) The exact neurons that initiate SNA within locomotor circuits are not known. The
first aim of this proposal is to identify the SNA initiator neurons and the mechanism by which they act. Uncovering
the mechanism that initiates SNA at the neural and activity level is fundamental to understand how SNA is
implemented. (2) After initiation, SNA expands and begins to produce motor outputs that mature into the larval
behavior. How does this activity pattern develop? The second aim of this proposal is to reveal the structure of
SNA at the population level and the pattern of activity in individual neurons, and begin to learn the effect of SNA
on mature behavior. (3) The molecular mechanisms that produce SNA remain poorly understood in any
organism. The third aim will identify genes that are necessary for the initiation and/or expansion of SNA. We will
focus on genes that have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, which intriguingly are highly
expressed specifically during the SNA window. In sum, this proposal will reveal the neural mechanisms for how
SNA initiates, the structure and neural components of SNA after initiation, and genes required for SNA. These
studies will provide new insight into how neural circuits form, or fail to form properly, in neurodevelopmental
disorders."
10863905,"Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard for measuring the effect of a treatment or intervention. Unfortunately, it is not feasible to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test all research questions, whether due to cost, achieving sufficient subject sizes or when administering an arm of the trial would be unethical. To understand the effects of therapeutics, policy changes, and other interventions where it is not possible to administer a clinical trial, researchers have developed approaches that attempt to simulate clinical trials in observational data. Despite sophisticated statistical methodologies, it is not clear whether it is possible to reliably simulate a randomized controlled in observational data. We aim to quantify one potential driver of these different results, differences between the clinical trial and real-world populations. In Aim 1, we compare trials that have individual level data available to three real- world data sources. In Aim 2, we develop methodologies to infer most likely individual-level statistics from aggregate trial statistics using real world data. Finally, in Aim 3 we compare neurological trials that do not release individual level data to real world data. We then estimate the transportability of treatment estimates across different populations including: the population eligible for the trial in RWD and the population ineligible for the trial but receiving the treatment in RWD. This allows for the study of indication drift and treatment heterogeneity. By uncovering differences between these groups, we may be able to identify groups that are underrepresented in clinical trials to help reduce healthcare disparities. The K99/R00 award will allow me to gain expertise in using regulatory sciences (with mentor Dr. Florence Bourgeois and advisor Dr. Deborah Schrag) for biologic discovery (with mentors Dr. Tianxi Cai and Dr. Isaac Kohane) within neurology (with mentors Dr. Page Pennell and Dr. Clemens Scherzer). My background in statistics, informatics, genetics, and machine learning with clinical data sources ideally positions me for the proposed project. The proposed training plan, mentoring and project will provide a strong foundation for a successful transition to independent research."
10931426,"Treatment for almost all patients with metastatic cancer has become a balance between managing often severe,
treatment-induced toxicity and preventing cancer progression. Progression leads to increasingly toxic
combination regimens until the patient succumbs either to treatment toxicity or to disease progression.
Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) is an emerging treatment modality that delivers radiation to targeted cells.
Alpha-particle-emitter RPT (αRPT) is a new and fundamentally different therapeutic modality that can break this
cycle. It is the only modality that can deliver highly potent, α-particles to disseminated cancer metastases.
Fundamentally, it is a radiation delivery modality. The radiation type delivered is far less susceptible to the
resistance mechanisms or unanticipated side-effects observed with biologic (or pathway inhibition) therapy and
chemotherapy. Despite these key differences, αRPT is being administered in a prolonged multi-cycle scheme
that severely compromises the potential efficacy of this treatment modality. In large part, this is because rigorous,
validated dosimetry methods for α-emitters do not exist. Such methods would make it possible to project potential
normal organ toxicity for individual patients so that treatment need not be prolonged for the sake of toxicity
evaluation. Our primary objectives are: 1) to develop and test dosimetry methodologies that will enable precision
medicine/treatment-planning-based αRPT for cancer therapy and 2) to gain the understanding needed to
optimize combination therapies involving αRPT. The hypotheses underpinning this program project grant are as
follows: 1. αRPT is a systemic cancer therapy modality that is particularly applicable to targeting metastatic
cancer; it is far less susceptible to conventional resistance mechanisms. It is also amenable to dosimetry-driven
treatment planning. 2. As currently implemented αRPT is not achieving its potential. Dosimetry-driven treatment
planning for RPT has been demonstrated to substantially improve long-term survival. 3. No one cancer treatment
modality is curative, and patients differ in their potential therapeutic response and toxicity. Promising agents are
inevitably combined with other therapeutics. Although mechanistic studies are used to point towards rational
combinations, clinical trials continue to be largely empirical in terms of the sequencing and amount of each
administered drug. A dosimetry and radiobiology-driven approach will substantially reduce the scope of human
experimentation. Considering these hypotheses, our overall objective is to develop methodologies and
investigate how best to transition RPT implementation from that of a “radioactive chemotherapy paradigm” to
one more closely aligned with treatment planning for radiation delivery. These foundational hypotheses motivate
the work proposed in this program project. Put very simply: dosimetry has been proven to improve outcome for
RPT agents but dosimetry for alpha-emitters is hard. Five years support of this program project will make αRPT
dosimetry easy enough to implement widely and thereby improve survival for currently incurable cancers."
10931399,"OVERALL: PROJECT SUMMARY
The Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer (YSPORE), now in its third funding cycle, involves a broad range of projects
and investigators with diverse expertise, whose goal is to decrease mortality from melanoma by developing novel
drugs and regimens to treat patients once it metastasizes and develop predictive biomarkers to select patients
for the optimal treatment regimen. YSPORE leans on the immense scientific and clinical strengths at Yale School
of Medicine and Yale Cancer Center including immunobiology, genetics, epigenetics, quantitative sciences,
immuno-oncology, animal models, and digital pathology. YSPORE investigators have made major contributions
in recent years to developing improved immune therapy approaches for melanoma patients with advanced
disease and novel single cell tumor profiling platforms. Advances in systemic therapies for advanced melanoma,
particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors, that prolong survival, pose a new set of challenges for clinicians which
will be addressed by the proposed research program, as we strive to increase the long term survival for all
melanoma patients. The YSPORE translational research team proposes to accomplish the objective of
decreasing morbidity and mortality from skin cancer through four specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Develop new
approaches to enhancing activity of PD-1 inhibitors by co-targeting the innate and adaptive immune systems in
immune checkpoint inhibitor naïve patients; Specific Aim 2: Study novel drugs that target the epigenetic modifier
KDM5B, to upregulate endogenous retroelements and enhance T cell infiltration in tumors that are unresponsive
or poorly responsive to immune checkpoint inhibitors; Specific Aim 3: Study novel cytokines to overcome
resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients whose melanoma has progressed on anti-PD-1; and
Specific Aim 4: Develop new research directions to decrease mortality from melanoma and nurture the next
generation of translational investigators focusing on skin cancer through a Developmental Research Program
and a Career Enhancement Program. We propose three cores (Administrative Core, Biospecimen Core and
Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core) to support the projects, their clinical aims, mechanistic studies, and
biomarker development for clinical application. The Projects and Cores are designed to be highly coordinated
with the goal of maximizing resources and potential impact. New collaborations will be established during the
funding period through the Developmental Research Program with the support of the Administrative Core.
Collaborations with other institutions and skin cancer SPORE sites will be fostered by the Administrative Core.
These coordinated efforts will enhance analysis of patient samples, use of cell cultures and animal models, and
development of predictive biomarker assays. Our purpose is to translate the innovative approaches proposed
here to clinical therapies for treatment of advanced skin cancer."
10883605,"An often overlooked yet essential component in the first responder system, emergency medical service (EMS) providers responded to almost 49 million emergency medical service (EMS) calls in 2021, routinely facing infectious disease exposure, intense work environments, and repeated exposure to trauma as they provided care in uncontrolled settings. As a result, several adverse health effects experienced by EMS providers including obesity, sleep disorders, musculoskeletal injuries, and mental health concerns have been documented. Despite the emergence of known adverse health impacts, research has not focused much attention to other well-known health issues such as alcohol use. This dearth of information is particularly concerning given the potential for risky alcohol consumption among EMS providers as a result of their stressful profession. Additionally, several known adverse health outcomes have been associated with alcohol use (e.g. occupational or accidental injuries, physical violence, sleep issues, substandard fitness, liver disease, and neurological impairment). Therefore, understanding the role of alcohol in EMS culture is essential to the development of health and wellness programs. The role of EMS providers has become invaluable, recently highlighted by the pandemic, making understanding alcohol use a priority to not only the quality of emergency services provided to the public but to the health and safety of EMS providers. Using a multi-method approach, this study will use a national sample of EMS providers to provide a foundational understanding of alcohol use within the EMS provider culture. Interviews with providers will provide insight into the role of alcohol consumption in EMS culture, factors which promote or moderate alcohol misuse, and workplace-focused policy interventions. A randomly selected sample of EMS providers will identify baseline prevalence of alcohol use providing a cross-sectional evaluation of sociodemographic and occupational risk factors. A prospective 2-year component will allow for the examination of associations between alcohol use and behaviors, and occupational, physical, and mental health outcomes."
10705937,"The exocrine pancreas is comprised of enzyme-secreting acinar cells, fluid-secreting duct cells, and
mesenchymal cells known as stellate cells. When the pancreas is injured, stellate cells become activated and
produce collagen, fibronectin, and other proteins that comprise fibrosis. Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are
also a significant component of the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor microenvironment.
PSCs have the potential to differentiate into cancer-associated fibroblasts which secrete insoluble extracellular
matrix (ECM) and other soluble proteins that stimulate cancer progression. Due to the stiffness of the ECM,
mechanical forces are exerted within the tumor microenvironment as cells grow, producing both elevated
tissue pressure and shear stress. We recently discovered that PSCs are exquisitely sensitive to pressure by
virtue of their expression of the mechanically activated ion channel, Piezo1. Stimulation of Piezo1 by
mechanical force or shear stress opens the channel and allows extracellular calcium to flow into the cell. In
both mouse and human PSCs, we demonstrated that activation of Piezo1 converts cells to a cancer-associated
fibroblast phenotype raising the possibility that blocking Piezo1 signaling would prevent conversion of PSCs
to cancer-associated fibroblasts. The liver is the primary site for pancreatic cancer metastasis. Notably, the
liver is primed to receive and harbor circulating tumor cells by soluble factors produced by the pancreatic
cancer thus creating a liver ‘pro-metastatic niche’. Our preliminary data indicate that Piezo1 activation in
PSCs due to elevated pressure/stiffness in fibrotic cancer tissue contributes to hepatic metastasis. We
hypothesize that elevated intratumoral pressure stimulates Piezo1 in PSCs, converting them to a cancer-
associated fibroblast phenotype. Activated PSCs produce soluble IL-6, IL-8, and other factors that induce a
pro-metastatic niche within the liver, enhancing pancreatic cancer metastases. We will test this hypothesis
in (i) PSCs in vitro, (ii) an orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer in vivo, and (iii) a genetically modified mouse
model of PDAC using a combination of genetic and pharmacological tools to determine the role of
mechanosensing and signaling within the pancreas and their contribution to pancreatic cancer metastasis.
These studies will establish the mechanisms by which intrapancreatic mechanical forces that normally occur
within PDAC generate a niche for liver metastases and may lead to novel therapies for pancreatic cancer
which is a leading cause of cancer mortality in Veterans."

10923915,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nationally, drug overdose is the leading cause of adult accidental death, claiming more lives every year than
every armed conflict since the end of the World Wars. Rhode Island is a state devastated by overdose
mortality and morbidity. The enormity and urgency of the opioid crisis call for new, translational approaches
and faster dissemination of research and promising interventions to transform the care of opioid addiction and
overdose, in Rhode Island and nationwide. To maximize the impacts of such scientific findings on the
behaviors of patients, clinicians, healthcare systems, and policy makers, the COBRE on Opioids and Overdose
needs concerted efforts and key resources to both generate and execute translational research and to create
effective study dissemination tools. Local resources to encourage and nurture translational research in the
social and behavioral to clinical sciences are limited, and opportunities for skill acquisition, concept
development, simulation, and user testing in translational research are not sustained over time. To better
optimize the efficacy and reach of the proposed projects, resources to generate and execute translational
research and to create effective study dissemination tools are needed. The Translational and Transformative
Research (T2) Core aims to continue to provide expert support and technical assistance to junior investigators
and affiliated researchers at Rhode Island Hospital, Brown University, and other area hospitals and academic
institutions. The long-term goal of the T2 Core is to establish a regional and national hub of translational and
transformative resources capable of supporting junior investigators, COBRE projects, and the broader scientific
community as they bridge theory to promising intervention and research to practice and policy change for
opioid use disorder and overdose. The Core aims are to: 1) Support the execution of high-quality, impactful
translational and implementation COBRE-affiliated studies through expert consultation and data collection

technology-driven interventions; 2) Develop a culture of excellence and innovation in translational and
transformative training and research on opioid use and overdose by hosting annual meetings and contests and
quarterly workshops and trainings; and 3) Promote and support implementation and dissemination of COBRE-
affiliated research study findings by assisting with data presentation, plans for dissemination, and study

10923918,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Community Engaged Research Core (CERC) of the COBRE on Opioids and Overdose, formerly the
Special Populations Core in Phase 1, promotes research among people who are impacted by opioids and
overdose, particularly people who are vulnerable and underserved. The CERC supports the overall mission of
the COBRE by building research infrastructure and providing services to early-stage investigators to support
the recruitment and retention of vulnerable and underserved individuals as research participants and promotes
the importance of community engagement with the goal of developing more robust, rigorous, and competitive
research projects. Guided by the conceptual and theoretical framework of Community Engaged and
Participatory Research, the CERC focuses on addressing the opioid epidemic by supporting and expanding
community-engaged research. The near-term goals of the CERC are to support Project Leaders and pilot-
funded investigators in the conduct of community-engaged research related to opioids and overdose. The long-
term goals of the CERC are to build a sustainable research infrastructure to support research involving people
impacted by opioids and overdose, particularly people from vulnerable and underserved communities, across
Rhode Island Hospital and affiliated institutions. The CERC promotes clinical, behavioral, and translational
research inclusive of community perspectives through four specific aims. Aim 1) Develop, promote, and
support best practices related to community engagement in research on opioids and overdose by a) offering
trainings and consultations to COBRE-supported investigators, affiliated researchers, and community partner
organizations on the Core’s five Principles of Community Empowered Research; b) maintaining and promoting
the established community advisory board to advise COBRE investigators at all stages of research; and c)
developing and implementing standards for trauma-informed research for COBRE projects. Aim 2) Promote
and support the ethical conduct of research on opioids and overdose by: a) providing regulatory support and
consultation services for human subjects research; b) creating project-specific advisory panels comprised of
researchers and community stakeholders to provide guidance on study design, implementation, and
dissemination activities; and c) providing mentoring in traditional research ethics and the ethics of community-
engaged research. Aim 3) Promote research on Harm Reduction (HR) by: a) facilitating HR research
presentations/workshops and offering HR trainings to community partners; b) supporting investigators
conducting HR research by engaging with HR organizations and people who use drugs; and 3) supporting drug
checking research within impacted communities. Aim 4) Promote the role of community engagement in
achieving rigor and reproducibility by: 1) mentoring new investigators on integrating community-engaged
research into study design, recruitment, data collection, and analysis; and 2) conducting workshops on how
community-engaged research can assist in strengthening attention to rigor, replication, and issues of external
validity across COBRE research activities."

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Nearly 400,000 people with an opioid use disorder (OUD) receive OUD treatment each year, or 19.7% of
all people with an OUD. Community reintegration following residential OUD treatment is a critically vulnerable
time, with most inpatients returning to use within 30 days. Given the extremely brief window of opportunity for
prevention intervention, evaluating time-sensitive proximal predictors of return to opioid use during community
reintegration is essential. Risk for return to use fluctuates substantially-even within timescales of hours-with some
people displaying higher variability than others. Identifying predictors of return to opioid use thus requires
methods that can track return to use closely over time, rather than relying on retrospective or cross-sectional
assessments. Ecological monitoring tools can accurately record severity and variability of return to opioid use in
daily life, proximally to when they occur. Yet, application of this work during the extremely high-risk period of
community reintegration is scarce. The proposed study will assess time-varying, longitudinal changes in
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms on risk for return to opioid use during community reintegration.
Further, the influence of physiology (heart rate variability [HRV] and electrodermal response [EDA]) on risk for
return to opioid use-including when coupled with PTSD symptoms-will be explored. These findings will inform
evidence-based tools to prevent and/or delay return to opioid use during community integration.
This study advances research by using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and a wearable biosensor
(Empatica) to test proximal relations between PTSD symptoms and return to opioid use-and the influence of
physiology-in the 30 days immediately following residential OUD treatment (N=150). EMA and biometrics capture
data frequently (or, for the Empatica E4, continuously), naturalistically, and in near real-time, allowing for
explication of within-person, proximal relations, as well as contextual factors underlying risk. Aim 1 determines the
influence of PTSD on return to opioid use during immediate community reintegration of OUD inpatients. Aim 2
evaluates the utility of passively collected physiology to detect return to opioid
use during immediate community reintegration of OUD inpatients.
 The proposed research fills important gaps regarding time-sensitive proximal predictors of return to opioid
use during the high-risk and understudied period of community reintegration. This work is important, timely, and
innovative. Developing evidence-based tools to prevent and delay return to opioid use during community
reintegration has important implications for the health of individuals in our nation."
10917139,"MECHANISMS OF CHROMATIN REGULATION OF TRANSCRIPTION
PROJECT SUMMARY
Over the past decade, the Poirier lab has worked to contribute to the fields of chromatin biology and
transcription regulation by developing a research program that is focused on the mechanisms by which
chromatin and nucleosome structural dynamics regulate genome accessiblity to transcription regulatory
complexes. We have developed and applied on our own and through collaborations, a wide range of
experimental tools that enable mechanistic studies including single molecule fluorscence, single molecule force
spectroscopy, ensemble fluorescence, and histone chemical ligations. In combination, we have quantitatively
investigated how chromatin regulators including histone post translational modifications (PTMs), PTM binding
proteins (readers), chromatin remodelers, linker histones, and transcripton factors function to control genome
accessiblity to chromatin regulatory complexes. Building off this work, we propose to investigate two central
questions in the fields of chromatin biology and transcription in the coming 5 years: (i) How do pioneer
transcription factors target their recognition sites within compact nucleosomes and chromatin, and then
facilitate chromatin decompaction? (ii) How do epigenetic regulators function together to synergistically or
antagonistically regulate genome accessibility to transcription regulatory complexes?
Pioneer factors (PFs) are master regulators of cell differentiation, are correlated with nucleosome depletion,
and somehow access their binding sites within compact chromatin that are inaccessible to canonical
transcription factors (TFs). Furthermore, PF disfunction is strongly correlated with disease most notably
cancer. By combining single molecule and ensemble studies we will directly test distinct mechanisms of PF
function, and determine what differentiates PFs from canonical TFs. Furthermore, through collaborative work
we will investigate the same PFs in vivo to determine how the PF mechanisms that emerge from our in vitro
studies impact their functions in vivo. This first direction will provide key insights into how pioneer factors gain
access to their sites within compact chromatin and what differentiates PFs from canonical TFs.
Epigenetic regulators including histone PTMs, and their readers and writers are critical to organismal
development, aging and numerous diseases including cancer. We and others have investigated these
regulators individually, yet how they function in combination remains largely unknown. Leveraging our ability to
prepare core histone and most recently linker histones with any combination of PTMs, histone H3 readers, and
most recently biochemical quantities of endogenous human SAGA and ATAC complexes, we will use single
molecule, ensemble and ES cell-based methods to determine how biologically relevant combinations of these
regulators control accessibility to canonical TFs and influence PFs. This second direction will provide a
mechanistic and functional foundation for understanding how key epigenetic transcriptional regulators
differentially control chromatin dynamics, accessibility and transcription."
10899626,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a highly aggressive and lethal disease due to the poor efficacy
of current therapies. Therefore, my research focuses on development of preclinical models for the identification
of better therapeutic strategies. Two main distinct features of PDA are the high frequency of KRAS mutations
that is poorly responsive to targeted therapies and an extensive desmoplastic tumor microenvironment (TME)
composed of a dense extracellular matrix (ECM), acting as a barrier to therapy, and multiple non-neoplastic cell
types including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), endothelial cells, and immune cells. These two prominent
features of PDA contribute to its intractability to current standard-of-care, calling for tailored targeted therapies
to improve patients’ survival.
 As we previously reported, activation of oncogenic Kras during PDA development results in alterations to
redox homeostasis and mitophagy pathways, providing evidence to support a redox-targeting approach. I will
employ genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), organoids, and organoid transplantation models of
PDA to test the potential efficacy of redox therapies, in particular mitochondrial inhibitors or ROS inducers in
combination with MEKi (downstream component of Kras signaling).
 Our prior work has also identified heterogeneity within the population of cancer-associated fibroblasts
(CAFs), each with their own distinct functions and active pathways. These fibroblasts include myofibroblastic
(myCAFs), inflammatory (iCAFs) and antigen-presenting (apCAFs) CAFs. Understanding the underlying
mechanisms of their active pathways is necessary for the development of therapeutic strategies to ablate tumor-
promoting fibroblasts specifically. We reported that JAKi shifted the CAF subtypes towards myCAFs and
suppressed tumor growth. I continue to target other active iCAF-signaling pathways through IL1R antagonism
or delivery of anti-LIF antibodies in combination with immunotherapy using our GEMM models. Understanding
how different types of CAFs contribute to tumor growth will provide a new avenue to develop strategies to ablate
the cancer cell-promoting CAFs. To this end, we will uncover the identities and functions of these CAFs in our
novel intraductally engrafted human organoid (IGO) model using a single-cell RNA sequencing approach. I will
establish a series of IGO models with patient-derived organoids and use these mice to test the efficacy of co-
targeting cancer cells and cancer-promoting CAFs by applying the findings from scRNA-seq analysis.
 Lastly, I will develop viral-induced GEMMs of PDA that can serve as a rapid platform to investigate the
importance of candidate genes identified in our transcriptomic or proteomic datasets derived from our organoid
and mouse models. Taken together, these multiple approaches I will employ to studying PDA, its primary driving
oncogene and aberrantly altered pathways, and the surrounding microenvironment will elucidate key pathways
the cancer cells require with the potential of these pathways acting as new therapeutic targets."
10890190,"Project Summary
The project’s overall goal is to determine important biological characteristics and investigate therapeutic 
options for pediatric high-grade gliomas (PHGG), the most aggressive of childhood central nervous system 
tumors and most common cause of childhood cancer mortality. PHGG survival rates are less than 5% for the 
subtype diffuse midline glioma and 20% for hemispheric histone 3-wild type (H3-wt) PHGG. PHGG are highly 
invasive and often grow diffusely among normal cells, limiting surgery as a therapeutic option. Radiation 
therapy (RT) is transiently effective, but the tumors nearly always recur. Despite hundreds of clinical trials, no 
chemotherapy has shown a definitive survival benefit in PHGG. Effective PHGG therapies are critically 
needed.
PHGG likely originates from stemlike tumor initiating cells (PICs). PHGG tumors comprise several 
distinct cell types of glial origin, in varying proportions. This tumor heterogeneity complicates understanding 
PHGG tumor biology and designing therapies. Aim 1 will investigate how each distinct cell type in PHGG 
contributes to overall tumorigenesis in a mouse model. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) analysis of 
orthotopic patient derived PHGG xenografts (PDX) will be used to define the cell types present and identify 
differentially regulated oncogenic pathways that drive their growth. Pathway expression will be knocked down 
by targeting key effector genes with shRNA using stable lentiviral transduction. The effect on tumor growth will 
be evaluated using survival, histology and single-cell RNA-Seq. 
Aim 2 will perform lineage tracing to determine whether a single PIC cell type produces all of the 
proliferating cell types that comprise PHGG. Lineage tracing will be performed in a mouse PDX model. Singlecell genomic DNA sequencing will be performed on PDX tumors. Mutational signatures consisting of single and 
multiple nucleotide variations as well as copy number variation will be used to define each cell type. Conserved 
patterns of mutation among cell types will be used to determine the hierarchical relationships among cell types. 
Once the lineage relationships are worked out, resistance to RT will be studied in the PDX model. RT is the 
most consistently effective therapy against PHGG but works only temporarily before cells regrow. RT 
resistance by cell type will be determined based upon differential survival of cell types versus control following 
RT. Drug screening of resistant cell types to identify radiation sensitizers will be performed. The candidate 
drugs will be combined with RT to investigate their effectiveness at increasing the duration of the RT effect."
10897896,"Project Summary
Cancer immunotherapy leverages a patient’s immune system to recognize and destroy tumor cells. However, 
a major challenge to current therapeutics is the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment that 
limits the potency of antitumor immune responses. A new approach for overcoming immunosuppression is the 
delivery of natural signals that stimulate innate immunity and transform tumors into an immunoactivated state to 
promote the infiltration and cross-priming of cytotoxic T-cells. In humans, the cGAS-STING innate immune 
pathway controls a potent antitumor response by detecting tumor-derived cytosolic DNA and inducing proinflammatory signaling. Mechanistically, DNA sensing activates the enzyme cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase) 
to synthesize the nucleotide second messenger 2′3′-cGAMP which then induces immune signaling through the 
cyclic dinucleotide receptor STING (STimulator of INterferon Genes). Thus, controlling cGAS-STING activation 
is an exciting new strategy for stimulating antitumor immunity. The clinical promise of natural and synthetic
STING agonists underscores the importance of discovering and defining the function of novel nucleotide second 
messenger signals that can expand the immunotherapy toolset. 
For the F99 phase of this proposal, I will describe my discovery that cGAS is part of a large family of diverse 
immune sensors named “cGAS-like receptors” (cGLRs). The remarkable diversity of uncharacterized cGLRs in 
humans and animals supports that many new nucleotide signals in innate immunity remain to be discovered. My 
research identified cGLR1 as a dsRNA sensor in Drosophila that controls an antiviral immune response through 
the novel nucleotide signal 3′2′-cGAMP, demonstrating that the cGLR enzyme family can sense ligands beyond 
dsDNA and signal through distinct nucleotide second messengers. My current research investigates how a new
Drosophila cGLR responds to a unique molecular pattern and signals through an uncharacterized nucleotide 
messenger. Ultimately, my research builds a mechanistic framework to define new cGLR signaling pathways in 
animals and humans and understand the role of diverse nucleotide second messengers in immunity.
For the K00 phase of this proposal, I will leverage our expanded knowledge of nucleotide second messenger 
signaling to discover new molecules that stimulate antitumor immunity. Using a bacterial screening platform to 
deliver diverse cGAS-like enzymes to tumors I will identify chemically unique nucleotide signals that activate
human innate immunity. As part of this new discovery pipeline, I will use in vivo tumor models and a mechanistic 
dissection of signaling in human cells to define new immune pathways and develop novel immunotherapy 
strategies. My research will harness the chemical diversity naturally generated by cGAS-like enzymes to expand 
our immunological toolset for treating cancers. 
In sum, my proposal will define new animal immune signaling pathways and discover novel antitumor 
molecules as tools for cancer immunotherapy."
10886139,"SUMMARY
Lesions, breaks, and errors in DNA are drivers of genomic instability resulting in a variety of cancers. The 
DNA damage response (DDR) is a signaling cascade that responds to breaks in the DNA and utilizes an array 
of DNA repair factors to correct the error and preserve genomic integrity. Cellular responses to DDR involve 
regulation of the cell cycle and signaling processes that either trigger DNA repair or programmed cell death. 
Proteins that function in DDR are shuttled into the nucleus in response to DNA damage. My PhD thesis work 
and the proposed goals center around understanding the mechanisms that regulate nuclear-cytoplasmic 
localization of DDR proteins. The F99 part of the proposal focuses on the regulation of Replication Protein A 
(RPA) by chaperone-like proteins. RPA is an essential single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding DDR factor that 
regulates all aspects of DNA metabolism including DNA replication, repair, and recombination. RPA is 
transported into the nucleus, recognizes, and binds ssDNA, and activates DDR by interacting with over three 
dozen RPA-interacting proteins (RIPs). How spurious RPA-RIP interactions are prevented in the cell in the 
absence of ssDNA has been a long-standing mystery. I have uncovered that Rtt105 (Regulator of Ty1 
transposition 105), a chaperone-like protein, functions as a regulator by interacting with multiple domains of RPA 
and conformationally restraining the complex. This serves as an inhibitor of RPA-RIP interactions. Using 
sophisticated biophysical, biochemical, and structural tools I show that ssDNA binds to the RPA-Rtt105 complex 
and removes the restraints to promote recruitment of DDR factors. In higher eukaryotes, a protein called RPAIN 
(RPA-interacting protein) serves as the functional ortholog of Rtt105 and I will focus on deciphering its 
mechanism of action. In addition, using cryoEM, I will determine the structures of RPA bound to these chaperonelike proteins. In the K00 part of the proposal, I will focus on identifying chaperone-like proteins specific to other 
cancer-related DDR proteins such as BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD52, and PALB2. In addition, I will investigate the 
regulatory and signaling mechanisms that control nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of DDR factors during DNA 
damage. Finally, using knowledge obtained from the biochemical and cellular studies I will develop targeted
small molecule cancer therapeutic inhibitors to regulate DDR. The combined F99 and K00 training phases will 
provide me with the necessary skills towards an independent research career focused on generating targeted 
cancer therapeutics."
10880643,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT 
Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer deaths in the US and is one of the cancers most 
strongly associated with a suboptimal diet. Within various dietary components, ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are 
emerging as an increasingly important risk factor for CRC. UPFs make up nearly 60% of Americans’ daily 
calories. A high UPF intake may increase CRC risk or worsen its prognosis through altered metabolites that may 
impact glycemic or inflammatory responses, or tumor microenvironment, resulting in cancer progression. Food 
processing may also introduce carcinogens and certain UPF components can contribute to somatic mutations. 
Besides, a high UPF intake is associated with excess intake of calories, leading to adiposity, an established risk 
factor for CRC. Thus, UPFs could be an important dietary risk factor for CRC progression and yet the UPF-CRC 
survival has not been adequately studied. While evidence suggests that CRC progression is associated with 
metabolites modulated by diet, the metabolomic profiles associated with UPFs remain to be characterized. 
Constituents of UPFs such as red or processed meats have been related to alkylating DNA damage and 
increased CRC mortality, yet the role of UPFs remains unclear. These unknowns highlight the critical need to 
comprehend the association between UPFs and CRC survival and the molecular determinants of this relationship 
for improving long-term CRC survivorship. Well-established large prospective cohort studies are crucial to 
offering rigorous data to elucidate the diet-disease association and infer causality. Advances in high-throughput 
metabolomic profiling and whole-exome sequencing (WES) show great promise to identify sensitive biomarkers 
that could better predict the diet-disease relationships. The overarching research goal of this F99/K00 proposal 
is to investigate the role of UPFs in CRC survival by integrating high throughput -omics and detailed dietary data 
collected among men and women from large cohorts. The F99 phase will focus on investigating the association 
between UPF intake and deaths due to CRC and all causes among CRC survivors (Aim 1); the K00 phase will 
shift the focus to investigating the molecular correlates of UPF-CRC survival relationship by integrating 
metabolomics profiling and tumor WES data and exploring the feasibility of a pilot intervention to reduce UPF 
intake among CRC patients (Aim 2). The research findings will inform dietary recommendations for CRC 
survivors, accelerate the discovery of novel biomarkers to pave the way for precision nutrition in oncology care, 
and provide new insights into nutrition interventions for improving the long-term survivorship of CRC. Under the 
mentorship of sponsors at Tufts Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy and Harvard T.H. Chan School 
of Public Health, the candidate will acquire rigorous research training and professional and career development 
skills for transition to an independent research career focus on studying the role of nutrition in cancer control and 
translate evidence into effective nutrition interventions and clinical practices to improve cancer survivorship."

 Project Summary
Given the large volumes of optical, electrical, genetic and behavioral data that will be generated, stored and
computationally analyzed, it is essential to establish a comprehensive and yet streamlined DSC. There are four
major data challenges that the DSC will address. (1) Data size. Each experimental lab will generate very large,
and rapidly increasing, datasets. We must contend with storing, pre-processing (e.g., spike sorting) and
processing (e.g., single-trial analyses) these large and growing datasets. (2) Metadata. Collaborations between
groups are often hampered by not fully capturing – in a searchable database and linked to the bulk data – all
animal and experiment conditions, or so-called metadata. We will build in capabilities and requirements to
electronically capture full metadata. (3) Data format. Collaborations are also often hampered by the effort
required to understand each lab’s dataset format. Data format often depends on whether a given measurement
system was custom built or relies on a commercial system. We will capture this information as part of the
metadata for historical data relevant to this U19, and moving forward we will adopt the increasingly-popular
NeuroData Without Borders (NWB) data format. Finally, (4) Across animals and labs. Performing large-
scale analyses across many animals and labs is often truly onerous. This is because all three of the challenges
listed above combine, causing one to shy away from anything other than essential analyses (e.g., pooling results
across just a few mice in one specific condition). We will both build our own data pipelines to automatically
query our metadata database and, subsequently, retrieve the indicated experimental data as well as adopt the
increasingly-popular DataJoint pipeline.
 Our DSC will be led by Prof. Shenoy, Dr. Roat (with considerable industrial-scale data handling
experience, and now at Stanford) and Prof. Ganguli (RP3 lead). Two full-time software engineers (TBD) will
implement the DSC architecture, including bulk data server, relational meta-database, data standards and
data pipeline. The software engineers will work closely with the rest of the team to help assure good
communication, and to help migrate analysis code and documentation into professional software standards for
dissemination. This will enable storage, retrieval and analysis of data in an efficient and modular way, which
enables rapid replacement of any piece of the data analysis pipeline as is essential for a creative environment
that also promotes rapid feedback of emerging ideas to subsequent experiments. We believe in Open Science,
including open source code (e.g., github) and data formats. We will share data with the broader community,
including with other U19 consortia. Thus our DSC is critical to the success of our proposed research, and
serves as the central hub of our U19 research."

will be developed for the broader U19 team: 1) latest-generation hydrogel-based volume acquisition, registration,
quantification, and analysis across species, including molecular analysis of the same cells with known activity
patterns during behavior via IEG-based activity traces using two of our hydrogel-tissue chemistry methods
(CLARITY and STARmap; 2) continuously-updated viral vectors for anatomy/activity visualization and causal
control, precision-designed to take into account both animal history (including past virus exposure/immune
status) and spectral overlap relevant to combinatorial usage of multiple optical tools together; and 3) versatile
viral tools for tagging (with fluorescent and activity-sensing-or-control tools) circuit elements naturally used
during specific behaviors, or for targeting cells based on many features of wiring, activity, and genetics. Aligning
the functional (activity) features of cortical neurons with their genetic profiles is crucial. For the PMAC, we note
the superb timing in that our recent development of STARmap (Wang et al. Science 2018) will allow addressing
this issue in a general sense, assigning deep typology and rich molecular signature information (hundreds of
genes, and even >1000 genes per cell) to the same individual neurons and ensembles observed to be naturally
and causally involved in behavior. The PMAC will pay particular attention to integrative methods for crossing
scales of observation, consulting with the DSC regarding effective means for storing and sending the massive
datasets. Analysis of the datasets will be with methods developed by the computational RP3 and the DSC.
Results from U19 teams in the course of implementation, relating to optical figures of merit, including signal-to-

 Project Summary
This research project will develop both theoretical principles and computational methods for elucidating how
external inputs interact with diverse internal neural state dynamics to drive fundamental neural computations,
including: (1) the generation of accurate percepts through cortical amplification of weak sensory inputs amidst
spontaneous background activity; (2) Bayesian integration of multisensory inputs to compute internal
estimates of external state variables and their uncertainty; and (3) the triggering and maintenance of discrete
internal attractor states dictating stable behaviors. Additionally, we will develop general and widely applicable
computational tools to empower the simultaneous all-optical read-write multi-SLM technology, developed in
RP1 and generalized to RP2 and RP4. These tools will: (1) employ state of the art systems identification
methods to algorithmically extract from neural data network models of internal state dynamics; and (2) employ
model based control theoretic methods to identify interesting optogenetic stimulation patterns that can both
reveal computational insights into, as well as enable control of, the dynamics of cortical circuits. Our theories
and computational tools for systems identification, insight and control, will both drive the design of
experiments, and in-turn be iteratively refined by the outcomes of these experiments, across all RP’s. In Aim
1 we will develop theories for how the interplay of external inputs, and internal spontaneous activity in spiking
neural networks with multiple cell-types, can set fundamental limits on the perceptual sensitivity of cortical
networks. We will iteratively test these theories in a tight theory-experiment loop across 2 homologous sensory
systems: mouse V1 in RP1 and macaque V1 in RP2. This parallel study will enable us to elucidate both
convergent and divergent properties of the fundamental computation of sensory amplification in two different
cortical networks that differ drastically in scale. We will also explore how the interplay between spontaneous
and evoked activity is modified by diverse internal state changes, including attention, thirst, satiety, and top-
down control of V1 in tight collaboration with experiments done in RP1 and RP2. In Aim 2 we will develop
theories for how neural circuits with basic synaptic and cellular properties can combine internal states with
external inputs to perform Bayesian integration of evidence. We will iteratively test and refine such theories in
theory driven experiments on Bayesian updating of position in mouse V1, MEC, RSC and hippocampus in RP4,
and Bayesian updating of evidence in joint recordings of macaque V1 and FEF in RP2. And in Aim 3 we will
develop our generalized computational tools described above for systems identification, insight and control,
and we will validate them by studying diverse internal state dynamics, including the robustness and flexibility
of attractor transitions in mouse OFC in RP1 and mouse RSC in RP4, Bayesian integration of position in
mouse RSC in RP4 and Bayesian integration of evidence in macaque V1-FEF loops in RP2. Thus overall, RP3
plays a unifying role through tight bi-directional feedback loops with RP1, RP2, and RP4 and the DSC."

are generated through healthcare operations and are often readily available. In contrast to learning paradigms
that depend on the expert annotation of images (e.g., delineating tumor regions) and are therefore time-intensive
and limited to smaller cohorts, training directly from WSIs using PLLs will allow the development of realistic
training datasets containing tens-of-thousands of subjects that can produce models with clinically-meaningful ac-
curacy. GPU accelerators have played a significant role in advancing deep learning methods for computational
pathology tools. Machine Learning Frameworks (MLFs), e.g., Pytorch and TensorFlow, provide researchers with
abstractions to quickly develop models that utilize GPUs. The evolution of GPUs and MLFs has been driven by
the analysis of small images, and so applying these tools directly to WSIs or other large medical images like
volumetric magnetic resonance or computed tomography is challenging. Adapting medical imaging problems to
the small image paradigm leads to many compromises resulting in suboptimal performance, increased imple-
mentation effort, and increased software/design complexity (e.g., patch based techniques or multiple instance
learning). As a result, the development of scalable ML models from PLLs by directly processing WSI images
through a deep learning pipeline is infeasible today on GPUs. Recent efforts that use unified GPU memory or
streaming approaches to overcome GPU memory limits and attempt to perform end-to-end training at WSI scale
have demonstrated superior performance to annotation or MIL. However, these approaches are either slow (due
to suboptimal data movement strategies), complex to adapt/use, or highly specific to a given network architecture
(limiting the ability to develop and explore new architectures). More general-purpose, efficient, and user-friendly
frameworks are needed to allow the development of WSI scale deep learning.
 This project will develop a robust software framework to facilitate seamless development and use of scalable
ML models, without the imposition of any limits on the sizes of handled images, unhindered by the limited memory
capacity in GPUs. The proposed SSTEP (Seamless Scalable Tensor-Expression Execution via Partitioning) soft-
ware framework will allow scalable and portable neural network models that directly process full high-resolution
images of arbitrary size for training or inference, on any (multi) GPU platform. SSTEP will allow the development
of novel deep learning paradigms that are purpose-built for medical applications, and will enable developers to
rapidly create and evaluate these tools using familiar MLFs - PyTorch or TensorFlow."

 Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading infectious disease killers globally despite the availability of
robust diagnostics, effective prevention, and treatment. Poor implementation of comprehensive TB programs
and HIV infection remain drivers of ongoing high TB rates in high burden countries such as South Africa. In
South Africa there are many losses in the TB care cascade; an estimated 95% of individuals with TB access
evaluation, yet only 82% are diagnosed, 70% initiate treatment, and 53% successfully complete treatment.
However, it is also imperative to also screen and treat subclinical TB infection to lessen the vast reservoir of
people at risk of progressing to TB disease, especially recent contacts of TB patients and people living with HIV
(PLH). Using implementation science methods and building on the success of the improvements in the HIV
care cascade “90-90-90” targets, our team has recently piloted two TB care cascades for drug-resistant and
drug-sensitive TB as well as piloted a TB prevention program including home visits to over 304 families,
screening 922 household contacts of patients with TB.
 This R01 award will adapt the Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach (SAIA), an evidence-based
implementation science strategy combining systems engineering tools into a clinic-level package for TB (SAIA-
TB), expanding upon successful SAIA models trialed across a range of clinical settings in sub-Saharan Africa and
the USA, and leveraging the PI’s preliminary TB cascade analysis data in South Africa. SAIA-TB will evaluate six
comprehensive TB indicators (screening, evaluation, diagnosis, linkage to care, treatment, and TB-free
survival) to aid frontline healthcare workers and managers to optimize cascade performance through the use
of a TB cascade analysis tool, process flow mapping, and continuous quality improvement cycles.
Our specific aims are to: (1) Evaluate the effectiveness of SAIA-TB on cascade optimization for patients
with TB and high-risk contacts (specifically PLH). We will use a stepped-wedge crossover trial to evaluate the
impact of SAIA-TB on comprehensive TB care in 12 rural clinics. We hypothesize that SAIA-TB implementation
will lead to a 20% increase in TB screening and TB preventive therapy or TB disease treatment initiation during
the 2-year intervention period. (2) Determine the drivers of SAIA-TB implementation variability across clinics.
The implementation process will be described using focus group discussions and key informant interviews with
clinic staff, analyzed using the consolidated framework for implementation research, with additional data
gathered from study logs to describe fidelity to SAIA-TB. (3) Assess the acceptability of comprehensive TB care
among patients accessing care at clinics implementing SAIA-TB at each step of the TB cascade. We will use the
theoretical framework for acceptability and the socioecological model to define acceptability and compare
individual-, family- and system-level barriers and facilitators to completing TB cascade steps among patients
with and without HIV infection."
10909881,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Transitions of Care (TOC) for high-risk, frequently hospitalized adults with chronic diseases are complex, costly,
and vulnerable to safety threats and poor health outcomes. Communication breakdowns, information lapses,
and IT-induced unintended consequences can result in poor follow-up and medication non-adherence, both of
which contribute to preventable readmissions or emergency room (ER) visits. The Transitional Care Model
(TCM) aims to reduce such risks through a holistic, collaborative, patient-centered approach with in-home
interventions. Prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), most in-
home interventions relied on in-person visits, which can be cost-prohibitive and unsustainable. One potential
sustainable and scalable solution is to use telehealth for in-home virtual visits; however, use of telehealth for
post-discharge TOC interventions has not been routinely implemented. In the post-COVID-19 era, given the
rapid expansion of telehealth, hospitals are well-positioned to initiate this virtual care. In-home virtual visits may
be particularly promising for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who are often
hospitalized, have multiple comorbidities, and require intensive medication teaching due to rampant inhaler
misuse. COPD affects more than 16 million US adults, many of whom are older, contribute ~$50 billion to
healthcare costs annually, experience high rates of acute care revisits, often due to care coordination failures.
For this reason, Medicare’s Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) aims to incentivize hospitals to
implement TOC programs for increased quality and value of care for COPD patients. However, currently, such
programs fall short of aligning with the full TCM. In-home interventions may be particularly salient for improving
medication skills and outcomes for patients with COPD given rampant inhaler misuses, the effectiveness of in-
hospital inhaler education, and evidence showing the need for inhaler education reinforcement post discharge.
Thus, our trans-disciplinary team proposes to implement and evaluate “TELE-TOC: Telehealth Education:
Leveraging Electronic Transitions Of Care for COPD patients,” which seeks to integrate virtual, pharmacy-based,
in-home visits for COPD patients within our hospital’s existing COPD HRRP. Our central hypotheses are that
virtual visits with pharmacists will be feasible to implement and will result in improved medication use and
outcomes among COPD patients at high risk for readmission. We aim to iteratively design TELE-TOC using
participatory study design and stakeholder input. We will then test the effectiveness of adding TELE-TOC virtual
visits in a randomized controlled trial among COPD patients enrolled in our HRRP program. Lastly, we will
develop a plan for a dissemination strategy and roadmap with national stakeholders to facilitate widescale
adoption of TELE-TOC nationwide."
10700331,"Increased fructose consumption has been implicated in many diseases, including type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease and cardiovascular disease. Pharmaceutical companies are designing inhibitors against
ketohexokinase (KHK), the primary enzyme for fructose metabolism. Most studies have used higher doses of
fructose than humans consume. We do not fully understand the mechanisms by which moderate fructose
consumption impact metabolism and how KHK inhibition would improve metabolism in these conditions.
Preliminary data suggest that modest dietary fructose metabolism may primarily impair adipose, not hepatic,
function. Using an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) against KHK, we studied rats fed: a low-fat “regular” chow
providing 15% calories from fructose and a high-fat diet providing 8% calories from fructose. KHK ASO improved
adipose insulin action in both conditions. Our overarching hypothesis is modest amounts of dietary fructose
increases hepatic VLDL production which can impair adipose insulin sensitivity leading to adipose dysfunction.
Fructose induced adipose dysfunction can then indirectly impact hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. We will
leverage our expertise in in vivo metabolism and explorations of lipid mediated insulin resistance –that the
accumulation of sn 1,2 diacyglycerol (DAG) in the plasma membrane recruits protein kinase C ε (PKCε) which
then phosphorylates and impairs insulin receptor kinase (IRK) activation—to probe this novel aspect of fructose
metabolism. Aim 1) To determine the mechanism of fructose mediated adipose insulin resistance. We
will teAbsst the hypothesis that fructose mediated hepatic lipogenesis into VLDL triglyceride exceeds the
capacity for WAT esterification, leading to the accumulation of adipose sn 1,2 diacylglycerol and WAT insulin
resistance. Rats will be fed isocaloric low-fat diets with increasing sucrose content (accounting for 0, 5, 10 and
15% calories from fructose) to determine the threshold at which adipose sn 1,2 DAG accumulates and activates
PKCε in relation to insulin signaling and insulin action in vivo. Using KHK ASO, we will establish that blocking
fructose metabolism prevents adipose insulin resistance. We will further demonstrate that blocking hepatic KHK
is sufficient to prevent adipose insulin resistance using a liver-specific GalNAc modified ASO. Aim 2) To
determine the role of high-fat diets in potentiating fructose mediated adipose dysfunction. We will test
the hypothesis that the addition of dietary fat reduces the “safe threshold” for dietary fructose. Dietary fats may
constrain the ability of adipose tissue to handle fructose derived VLDL triglyceride. In addition, preliminary data
suggests the combination of fat and fructose increase expression of 11β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1,
potentially another mechanism accounting for fructose induced adipose dysfunction and asses changes after a
long term (24 week) exposure to high-fat, fructose diets. Aim 3) To assess the mechanisms by which KHK
ASO impacts hepatic insulin action. KHK ASO decreases basal Gck expression and glycogen synthesis via
the direct pathway after an oral glucose load. Fructose metabolism will increase the concentration of hepatic
dihydroxyacetone phosphate, a putative activator of mTORC1. This in turn could increase SREBP1c mediated
activation of glucokinase (Gck) which would raise the capacity for glycogen synthesis via the direct pathway.
KHK inhibition may alter the pathways that support glycogen synthesis with an increase in the indirect, or
gluconeogenic pathway, balancing a decrease in the direct pathway (which is dependent on Gck). We will use
a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to establish the role of fructose metabolism in regulating Gck
expression through mTORC1 activation. Further, we will determine if KHK inhibition leads to increase Cori and
Cahill cycling and the potential for increased lactate flux when used with metformin."
10812430,"Abstract
HIV-1 reservoir cells are a small subset of CD4 T cells that harbor chromosomally integrated HIV-1 DNA, persist
life-long and represent the major barrier to a cure of HIV-1 infection. For a long time, proviruses in these cells
have been regarded as transcriptionally silent, which permits to escape from host immune recognition and to
resist antiviral host immunity. However, recent studies enabled by single-genome and single-cell analytic
technologies have shown that these cells can frequently be transcriptionally active and be vulnerable to host
immune responses. In line with this observation, our recent work suggested that viral reservoir cells may be
subject to immune-mediated host selection forces that promote elimination of proviruses integrated in permissive
chromatin location supporting active viral transcription, while proviruses in repressive heterochromatin locations
appear to have a selection advantage. In selected cases, such selection forces may, over extended periods of
time, lead to a highly distinct reservoir profile dominated by intact proviruses integrated in heterochromatin
locations; such a highly atypical proviral reservoir landscape may contribute to drug-free control of HIV-1 in elite
and post-treatment-controllers. To better characterize the vulnerabilities and susceptibilities of viral reservoir
cells to host immune cells, we here propose to use a novel single-cell proteogenomic profiling approach designed
to evaluate the surface phenotype and intracellular markers of patient-derived HIV-1-infected cells from blood
and tissues. We hypothesize that viral reservoir cells that persist during antiretroviral treatment are enriched and
selected for phenotypic features conferring repression of proviral transcriptional activity and resistance to
immune-mediated killing, resulting in reduced exposure to and protection from antiviral host effector cells. To
test this hypothesis, we will conduct a detailed phenotypic analysis of HIV-1 reservoirs cells harboring intact and
defective proviruses, focusing on more than 150 individual surface markers and evaluating cells collected ex
vivo from the peripheral blood and from lymphoid tissues of ART-treated persons (specific aim 1). In addition,
we will longitudinally track the evolution of the phenotypic viral reservoir profile, starting in early stages of ART
initiation; simultaneously, the evolution of host immune responses will be analyzed to test the hypothesis that
only a small subset of viral reservoir cells with optimal adaptation to host immune responses can survive long-
term (specific aim 2). Finally, we will evaluate the susceptibility or resistance of HIV-1 reservoir cells to immune-
mediated killing in functional assays and identify surface markers that can be pharmacologically targeted to
reduce resistance of viral reservoir cells to immune-mediated killing (specific aim 3). By providing a detailed
phenotypic characterization of HIV-1 reservoirs cells in direct ex vivo assessments, our studies will be highly
informative for efforts to limit HIV-1 long-term persistence through clinical interventions."
10700258,"The derangements of mineral metabolism that accompany chronic kidney disease (CKD) greatly
increase the risk of cardiovascular mortality. Veterans suffer from CKD and the cardiovascular
consequences disproportionately compared to the general population. Amelioration of the
biochemical abnormalities, specifically phosphate (Pi), calcium (Ca), and parathyroid hormone (PTH)
is associated with superior survival in dialysis patients; however, only a minority of patients can
achieve and sustain the levels proposed by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)
guidelines. The major barriers are the complexity and individual diversity of CKD-MBD and the
heterogeneity in individual response to therapy. We have developed and validated a systems biology
model encompassing both measurable (serum Ca, Pi, and PTH) as well as non-measurable, clinically
relevant parameters of mineral metabolism such as loss of bone mineral and vascular calcification.
Applying artificial intelligence techniques of reinforcement learning in combination with our model,
we have determined that standard therapeutic approaches targeting Pi, Ca, and PTH may not result in
optimal control of the pathophysiologic processes that result in morbidity and mortality.
These results suggested two hypotheses to be tested in this proposal. Hypothesis 1: Based on
individual biochemical and mineral flux responses to therapy, we can identify phenotypic subsets of
CKD-MBD whose courses of disease are distinct, and which mandate different therapeutic
approaches. Hypothesis 2: Targeting the abnormal fluxes of mineral, out of bone and into the
vascular smooth muscle, will lead to significant refinements in the therapy of CKD-MBD for the
individual by incorporating the degree of bone turnover into the recommendations for achieving
KDIGO guidelines for biochemical parameters.
We will address these hypotheses through the following aims:
Aim 1. Obtain human data on non-routinely measured markers of mineral metabolism and
cardiovascular health within CKD-MBD.
Aim 2. Enhance the Systems Biology Model of CKD-MBD with additional markers of mineral
metabolism.
Aim 3. Develop Systems Biology guided treatment regimen to CKD-MBD based on clinical end points.
Aim 4. Validate treatment regimen for physician’s acceptance using Physician-in-the-Loop approach.
This innovative and highly translational approach will advance the over-arching goal of this project to
improve clinical outcomes for Veterans with CKD-MBD through the application of personalized
therapeutics. The use of large Veteran databases to develop personalized medical therapy for complex
disease, exemplified in this application, is a priority for the Department of Veterans Affairs."
10819523,"Project Summary
Ending the HIV epidemic will require novel strategies to expand the HIV prevention continuum among men
who have sex with men (MSM), who are disproportionately affected by HIV. The COVID-19 pandemic has
underscored the need for remote care approaches such as HIV self-testing (HIVST) to sustain access to HIV
services. However, the benefits of self-testing are limited if they do not spur behavioral change or linkage to
care, yet only 1 in 10 MSM who self-test obtain preventive care afterwards, and the majority of MSM with
indications for PrEP have never used it. Interventions to support linkage from HIVST, the first key step in the
HIV “status neutral” continuum, are needed. To maximize the impact of HIVST, linkage to care is a critical
practice gap that needs to be addressed, a gap that can potentially be bridged by a peer intervention to
support linkage and PrEP uptake. To expand the HIV prevention continuum among MSM, this research will
leverage HIVST and evaluate a peer-led intervention to support engagement in care and PrEP uptake through
peer linkage after self-testing. The overall goal of this career development award is to provide Dr. Cedric Bien-
Gund with the necessary research skills to become an independent clinician-investigator in the development,
evaluation, and implementation of behavioral interventions to prevent HIV infections. To achieve this goal, we
have assembled a mentoring team and proposed a rigorous training plan to develop his skills in 1) mixed
methods for behavioral interventions, 2) intervention design and mapping for implementation, and 3) advanced
clinical trial design, including implementation science designs. These training objectives complement a
research plan to develop and pilot a behavioral intervention to increase linkage to PrEP among MSM through
integration of HIVST distribution and peer-led linkage to PrEP. The specific aims are: 1) identify barriers and
facilitators to PrEP linkage after HIV self-testing among MSM, 2) develop a peer-led linkage intervention for
HIVST, and 3) test the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the intervention on PrEP linkage and
uptake among MSM by conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial. This project will leverage an ongoing
collaboration with the Philadelphia Department of Public Health to expand HIVST and PrEP uptake. The
proposed research addresses the first steps in the HIV prevention continuum and will support Dr. Bien-Gund's
goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise in behavioral interventions to end the HIV
epidemic. This research will provide preliminary data for an R01 application to test the intervention in a hybrid
type I effectiveness-implementation trial, with the goal of optimizing the impact of HIVST by closing the linkage
gap after testing."
10832107,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
ESwatini has the world’s highest prevalence of HIV, with more than one in four adults currently living with HIV.
Extraordinary efforts at reducing the burden of HIV/AIDS have led eSwatini to become the first African country
to surpass the UNAIDS “95-95-95” goals of diagnosing ≥95% of people living with HIV (PLHIV), providing
treatment to ≥95% of those diagnosed, and achieving viral load suppression in ≥95% of those on treatment,
leading to dramatic reductions in HIV mortality. In contrast, deaths from many non-communicable diseases
(NCDs) in eSwatini are increasing. Deaths from cardiovascular disease, the second-leading cause of death
after HIV/AIDS in eSwatini, have risen by 11% since 2000. Deaths from cancer, diabetes, chronic kidney
disease, self-harm, and violence have increased by 12-35% over the same time period. Accordingly, the
eSwatini Ministry of Health (MoH) is keenly interested in leveraging HIV care systems to improve care and
prevention for cardiovascular disease and other high-burden NCDs. Due to resource constraints, not all NCD
care can be provided to all residents of eSwatini, but a health benefits package (HBP) could be created to
deliver the greatest possible health benefits within the limits of the country’s health budget and cadre of
healthcare personnel. Additionally, like many other countries, eSwatini faces a growing risk of pandemics,
conflict, and natural disasters due to population growth and climate change. These events can cause
exogenous shocks that interrupt routine healthcare delivery, which may have implications for prioritizing which
health services to offer. For example, investments in primary prevention may become a more efficient option
than continuously delivering treatment for diseases when taking into consideration the likelihood of exogenous
shocks to the healthcare system over coming decades. Our team combines expertise in modeling, health
economics, HIV/NCD care integration, and eSwatini’s health system – including the current Director of
Planning for the eSwatini Ministry of Health. Our study will (Aim 1) determine which non-HIV health services
will be efficient to co-deliver with HIV care given the evolving demographics and health risks among people
living with HIV in eSwatini, (Aim 2) determine which services to include in eSwatini’s HBP to maximize
population health under resource constraints, and (Aim 3) assess trade-offs between health system efficiency
and resilience to exogenous shocks such as pandemics, conflict, and natural disasters. Additionally, eSwatini
is likely to be a forerunner of health policy questions to arise elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, where other
countries are working to surpass the “95-95-95” treatment goals in coming years. Accordingly, we will
disseminate results in the Eastern, Central, and Southern Africa Health Community to amplify the impact of our
research and set the stage for future work."
10927341,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 As of 2015 there were 940 million people with some degree of visual impairment in the world. Visual
impairments generate considerable economic burden for the society. The World Health Organization estimates
that 80% of visual impairments are either preventable or curable with treatment. Noninvasive imaging
techniques have been used extensively by eye specialists for diagnosis and treatment of visual disorders and
imaging is one of the priorities in the six core program areas of the National Eye Institute. As a noninvasive
high spatial resolution technique for measuring brain activities, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
has provided a wealth of data on visual cortical organizations. Although numerous studies have been devoted
to discovering and validating different retinotopic maps in the human visual system, limited progress has been
made in developing software tools that fully consider the intrinsic geometrical features of the underlying cortical
structures, enforce diffeomorphic mapping when constructing retinotopic maps and atlases, and integrate both
individual and population statistics for more robust data analysis. In preliminary work, we have developed a
complete and invertible description of retinotopic maps (U.S. Patent Application Nos. 16/230,284 and
63/004,721, supported by NSF collaborative research awards DMS-1413417 and DMS-1412722). This project
will continue developing and applying novel quasiconformal geometry and hierarchical Bayesian modeling
(HBM) algorithms to retinotopy data obtained from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), the largest high
resolution retinotopy dataset to date. We hypothesize that, by combining Beltrami smoothing, quasiconformal
mapping and HBM, the proposed approach will reduce manual annotation work and maximize the statistical
power of retinotopic mapping techniques. The project aims to: (1) Develop computational methods to
effectively smooth retinotopic maps across multiple visual areas based on Beltrami smoothing. With
Beltrami descriptions, the proposed method will simultaneously smooth eccentricity and polar angle retinotopy
data in V1, V2 and V3, while preserving the underlying topological continuity; (2) Develop computational
methods to effectively register retinotopic maps of multiple visual areas across subjects with
quasiconformal mapping. Unlike previous work that relied on either structural MRI (sMRI) or fMRI data only,
the proposed method will simultaneously register both sMRI and fMRI data from multiple visual areas across
subjects and ensure diffeomorphism; (3) Develop an HBM of the retinotopic maps to capture the hierarchy
at both the individual and group levels. The proposed HBM will help overcome measurement noise, reveal
both population properties and individual differences, and offer unprecedented accuracy on retinotopic map
analysis; (4) Develop and disseminate software tools and atlases of human retinotopic maps. The
developed open-source software tools can be extended to analyze data from patients with not only visual
impairment but many other neurological and psychiatric disorders."
10914013,"Abstract: The heat shock transcriptional factor 1 (HSF1) plays central roles in cellular protein
homeostasis (proteostasis), and is precisely regulated for organismal health. HSF1 is activated by
proteotoxic stresses in the cytosol and nucleus, and induces the conserved protective response called
the heat shock response (HSR). HSF1 is also activated in specific physiological conditions to regulate
development, reproduction, longevity and energy metabolism. Conversely, aberrant activation of
HSF1 supports malignancy. While the transcriptome and regulatory mechanisms for HSF1 in the HSR
have been extensively studied, significant knowledge gaps exist for programmed activation of HSF1 in
physiology and dysregulation of HSF1 in diseases. Specifically, it is poorly understood: 1> why HSF1
is essential for certain cell types or cellular states and dispensable for others, and 2> what
mechanisms determine HSF1's regulons and activities in those physiological and pathological
conditions. My lab has established animal and cell models to address these questions. Taking the
nematode C. elegans as a model and the genetic tools we newly developed, we have found that
HSF1 is required in the germline for progenitor cell proliferation in a manner uncoupled from the HSR,
and this requisite is dictated by IGF-1/PI3K signaling. We will explore how the IGF-1/PI3K pathway
regulates HSF1 functions in germ cells by cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms.
Meanwhile, we are using cancer cell lines to understand HSF1's roles in abnormal cell proliferation,
where the transcriptional program of HSF1 is known to be distinct from the HSR. We have recently
identified epistatic interactors of HSF1 in proliferation and survival through CRISPR screens in
prostate cancer cells. Guided by the results, we will study the roles of HSF1 in cell-cycle progression
and its regulation by the replication-coupled nucleosome assembly factor CHAF1B. Through these
studies, we expect to uncover the context-dependent requirements for HSF1, and identify the
mechanisms that specify the unique transcriptional programs of HSF1 in germline development and
uncontrolled cancer cell proliferation from those of the canonical HSR. Our research will establish a
framework for future studies on HSF1 in other physiological processes, and shed light on potential
therapeutic strategies that target the specific regulatory pathways of HSF1 in cancer."
10931433,"CORE C: Summary Abstract
Core C is comprised of two groups: the Human Genome Editing Laboratory (HGEL) led by Dr. Friederike Herbst
and the Translational and Correlative Studies Laboratory (TCSL) led by Dr. Joseph A. Fraietta. Core C works
closely with Cores A and B to actively support the proposed P01 grant renewal with the following three Aims:
In Specific Aim 1: Process Optimization, Development and Product Characterization, Core C will provide
knowhow and consulting support to Core B to manufacture CRISPR-edited CAR T cells in a shortened
manufacturing process (Project 1: CD5 knockout anti-CD19 CAR T cells). Core C will conduct scale-up studies
to optimize base editing of T cells and matching HSPC cell populations for further lockdown of manufacturing
processes to tech transfer to Core B (Project 2). Core C will develop a pipeline for subsequent characterization
of the gene edited cell products (T cells and HSPC) including assay developmental procedures important for
product safety and release testing, in line with FDA regulations for future IND applications. In Specific Aim 2:
Support of Clinical Trials Proposed by the 3 Projects, Core C will support all three clinical trials within this
grant proposal. Project 1: CD5 knockout anti-CD19 CAR T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoid
malignancies. Project 2: CD45-edited CART45 in tandem with CD45-edited matching HSPCs in patients with
acute myeloid leukemia; and Project 3: combination of MIL- and PBL-derived anti-BCMA CAR T cells in patients
with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. In addition to supporting the manufacturing Core B with product safety
analysis and product release assays testing for on-/off target editing, transduction efficiency, replication-
competent lentivirus and mycoplasma, Core C will perform a range of sample processing, biobanking and
correlative assays and data collection that will be tailored to the individual needs of each of the clinical trials. In
Specific Aim 3: Analytical Platform Development, Core C will strengthen three assay platforms identified as
being key correlative assay technologies needed to support the projects and clinical trials in this grant proposal.
Overall, all platforms - once established - will allow the identification as well as the molecular and phenotypic
characterization of rare subpopulations of therapeutic cells. Moreover, the generated data package will be
evaluated and utilized to predict and improve patient outcome. 1. Single cell transcriptome analysis to expand
correlative analysis by extending established protocols and existing data to optimize single-cell methods on
samples drawn from internally biobanked accessions. 2. Digital PCR using a new QIAcuity One plate-based
system to perform sensitive standard-independent quantification of rare sequences and support the trials with
assessment of gene editing and gene marking. 3. Flow cytometry Developing new 28+ color panels on a
spectral cytometer to be used for retrospective batch analysis of leukapheresis material, transduced cellular
products, and post-infusion samples to investigate T cell differentiation, activation, exhaustion and antitumor
activity as well as CD34+ cell engraftment, multi-lineage differentiation and function."
10931438,"Radiopharmaceutical therapy with α-particle emitters (αRPT) is a highly effective cancer therapy modality; it
delivers potent alpha-particle radiation to cancer cells and is therefore not susceptible to resistance seen with
most other cancer therapies. It is also unique in that alpha-emitters also emit photons that can be imaged by
nuclear medicine modalities. This allows for patient-specific treatment planning and optimization of patient
therapy. These unique features of αRPT have not been used, however, because αRPT is so effective that the
activity used to treat patient is too low to be imaged with conventional nuclear medicine imaging methods. In this
project we will develop and implement accurate single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging
methods that overcome this limitation. Our hypothesis is that enabling quantitative αRPT imaging and making it
convenient so that it is widely adopted will improve the outcome of patients treated with αRPT. The distribution
of the radionuclide in vivo is a prerequisite for estimating the absorbed dose distributions needed to plan and
optimize αRPT’s. There are several significant challenges to imaging the distribution of α-emitters in patients.
Due to their high linear energy transfer (LET) and resulting lethality, low administered activities are used. Typical
decay chains include multiple daughter radionuclides that emit photons, and it is important to also determine
their activity distribution. Also, the photon emission spectrum for α-emitters typically has many low-abundance
gamma rays spread over a wide energy range. These properties have made imaging-based dosimetry difficult;
the imaging that has been performed has not been quantitatively rigorous. We propose to develop imaging
reconstruction methods applicable to clinical SPECT systems that will account for the complex imaging physics
and allow for validated quantitative SPECT imaging of αRPT for accurate dosimetry calculations. The overall
goal is to incorporate such quantitative SPECT imaging into a clinically implementable imaging workflow that can
provide accurate dosimetry for treatment planning and efficacy monitoring. Our group, in collaboration with
members of a Hopkins startup company, Radiopharmaceutical Imaging and Dosimetry, LLC (Rapid), have
already made considerable progress on SPECT imaging of αRPT agents. In Aim1, we will extend this work to
develop quantitative reconstruction methods for SPECT imaging of alpha emitters that produce accurate
measures of activity distribution for dosimetry which will also be useful for SPECT diagnostic imaging in general.
Another challenge for imaging αRPT is the requirement that patients return for several imaging sessions to obtain
the needed pharmacokinetics in normal organs and tumors. Thus, in Aim 2 we will investigate the trade-off
between number of imaging time-points and the accuracy of dosimetry. In Aim 3 we will apply the developed
imaging method and statistically analyze the relationships between quantitative image measures, dosimetry,
dose-response, and therapy outcome. In Aim 4, we consider several potential surrogate radionuclides and
assess their utility for pre-therapy dosimetry."
10702210,"Summary: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is increasing rapidly in the Veterans Administration Health
Care System (VAHCS). Experience with CGM is greatly modifying our concepts of glucose control and our
understanding of how to define and achieve optimal glucose goals. Most available data on CGM has been
derived from short-term small trials or observational studies conducted in classic early onset T1D patients and
have illustrated the value of CGM in these patients with respect to glucose lowering and reduced hypoglycemia.
However, much less is known about benefits of CGM in T1D that develops later in life nor in the far more frequent
setting of T2D. There is also very little known about CGM related effects on the many serious, debilitating and
costly diabetes complications that are so prevalent in both T1D and T2D. Because use of CGM has substantial
financial costs and requires extensive time on the part of patients, physicians, nurses and other staff participating
in diabetes care to implement and sustain CGM, we need to better understand how to best use CGM and what
is gained from it. Our preliminary data demonstrate we can extract clinical and demographic information for
T1D and T2D patients and evaluate the benefits of CGM initiation on short-term glucose control and several
adverse outcomes. There is also a striking signal of potential benefits on major comorbidities such as renal
disease, cardiovascular disease and even mortality. Now we propose to expand the years of data collection and
follow-up time to directly focus on the benefits of CGM initiation on long-term clinically important outcomes. There
will be three main aims for this project. In Aim 1, we will assess in T1D and T2D within the VAHCS the effect of
CGM initiation (compared with matched nonCGM users) on the occurrence of ER or hospital admissions for
hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia and all-cause hospital admissions over 4 years. In all three aims we will use
overlap propensity score weighting to balance CGM users and nonusers and will conduct multiple sensitivity
analyses to assess and adjust for potential bias in matching. As a secondary analyses we will compare the
effects in T1D and T2D of initiating CGM on long-term glucose control. We will also examine baseline features,
such as age, racial/ethnic identity, glycemic control, hypoglycemic risk, complication status, CGM type as well
as patterns of CGM use to identify subgroups with differential long-term benefits of CGM on these outcomes. In
Aim 2, we will assess in T1D and T2D the effects of CGM on development of renal disease and diabetes
complications. To achieve this aim, we will compare the effects in T1D and T2D of initiating CGM (vs. nonCGM
users) on development of a composite outcome indicating severe renal disease and assess change in a validated
diabetes complication index score. As in Aim 1, we will also attempt to identify subgroups with differential benefits
of CGM on these outcomes. We will also explore the contribution of improved HbA1c to CGM related
improvements in outcomes. Aim 3 will build on promising preliminary data to examine the effects of CGM on a
cardiovascular disease composite outcome (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and heart failure) and all-
cause mortality. We will initially compare CGM users and nonusers in combined cohorts of T1D and T2D patients
to ensure sufficient event numbers to detect small group differences, but will subsequently examine them in
distinct groups. We will also conduct subgroup comparisons as described for Aims 1 and 2. To minimize
differences in extent of follow-up between individuals we will initially limit follow-up time to 4 years, although
secondary analyses will explore extending the follow-up time to 6 years where appropriate. This study will clarify
the range of benefits that can be obtained with longer-term use of CGM, and determine if these extend well
beyond improvements in glycemic control. These aims will determine whether CGM initiation may reduce
multiple relevant outcomes and how to best identify these individuals. Results from this study could add
prevention of serious clinical outcomes to the rationale for initiating CGM. Overall, the study will advance our
ability to apply precision medicine in our application of CGM to both later-onset T1D and T2D patients."
10702038,"The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the US is rising concomitant with aging of the general
population and coexistence of comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Cardiovascular
outcomes, sudden death and overall mortality are worse with advancing CKD. Ischemic kidney injury may
exacerbate other disease processes and accelerate the progression to ESKD. The underlying pathways and
contributing factors to the development and progression from AKI to CKD are poorly understood. Abnormalities in
mitochondrial function play critical roles in many disease processes. We have recently shown megalin is present
in the mitochondria, where it associates with stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) and SIRT3; two proteins that promote anti-
oxidant defenses. Internalization into the cell and shuttling of the intracrines angiotensin II, STC1 and TGF-β1 from
the cell surface to the mitochondria are megalin-dependent; deletion of megalin is associated with impaired
mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis. Megalin is found in clathrin-coated pits and provides endocytic receptor-
mediated ligand uptake. Here, we show tubular epithelium-specific KO of megalin aggravates AKI after
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and is associated with severe and sustained kidney inflammation, upregulation of TGF-
β1 and fibrosis, cell cycle arrest, mitochondrial stress, dysregulated lysosomal function and rapid progression to
CKD. Additionally, we show TGF-β1 is degraded by the mitochondrial caseinolytic protein proteases. We
hypothesize that megalin is a guardian of kidney health; megalin downregulates pathways of cellular
injury (inflammation, TGF-β1, fibrosis) and preserves recovery pathways (mitochondrial function,
lysosomal biogenesis); upregulation of megalin may be a therapeutic target to slow CKD progression.
Aim 1A will examine kidney injury, TGF-β1 signaling, fibrosis and progression to CKD in mice with tubular
epithelium-specific overexpression of megalin using post-I/R model. Aim 1B will examine the role of mitochondrial
caseinolytic protein proteases in the termination of TGF-β1 signaling. Aim 1C will examine the expression of cell
cycle regulators and TGF-β1 signaling after I/R in mice with combined conditional tubular epithelium specific
deletion of megalin and SMAD3. Aim 2 will examine the expression of signaling molecules involved in autophagy
and lysosomal biogenesis (mTOR, PGC1α, TFEB, ERK2 and calcineurin) and characterize lysosomal morphology
following hypoxia/reoxygenation in sgScramble and sgLrp2 BUMPT cells. This proposal will examine new
paradigms for megalin-mediated kidney protection and identify therapeutic targets to prevent CKD progression
after ischemic AKI."
10891525,"Project Summary: Administrative Core
The Administrative Core for the Nebraska Center for Molecular Target Discovery and Development (CMTDD)
leads, implements, and supports the Center's primary activities. These activities include creation of critical
infrastructure for the (1) identification of disease targets, (2) generation of small molecules that manipulate those
targets, and (3) analysis of preclinical models in which to evaluate the manipulation of those targets. Creation of
that infrastructure facilitates the Center's effort to deliver training and mentoring to promising new investigators
focused on the discovery of new approaches that improve the treatment of disease. The Administrative Core
provides the organizational and programmatic leadership necessary to ensure the CMTDD works efficiently
toward attaining its goal and is responsive to emerging research opportunities that improve its effectiveness.
This effort includes continued implementation of Center-wide activities – including an annual retreat, monthly
meetings of the CMTDD membership, formal and informal training, and support for external seminar speakers –
to create a collaborative research environment, promote the CMTDD on a national level, and build a pool of
talented doctoral and postdoctoral students in the laboratories of Center members. The Administrative Core
coordinates a faculty development plan that includes a Research Project Program and Pilot Grant Program
designed to accelerate the transition of talented Research Project Leaders to independence and support the
development of multi-investigator grants and program projects. Finally, the Administrative Core serves as a
coordination point between CMTDD members and the Center's Scientific Cores. The Administrative Core
supports research programs and related scientific cores to develop innovative tools for the detection and
validation of molecular targets and provide guidance in experimental design and data analysis."
10891531,"Project Summary: Organoids Core
Multiple studies support the ability of organoids to faithfully retain the biological characteristics of the tissues from
which they are derived, thus offering a unique system for molecular target discovery and development.
Importantly, patient-derived organoids (PDOs) retain the drug responses seen in the original patient, indicating
that organoid culture conditions maintain the target profile and signaling networks of the originating tissue.
Organoids also have the advantage that they can be genetically manipulated for target modulation and can be
grown as xenografts that histologically mirror the originating normal or tumor tissue for both in vitro and in vivo
testing. Based on these strengths, an Organoid Core is proposed for Phase 2 of the CMTDD COBRE. This Core,
which builds on the success of the organoid component of the Phase 1 Target Validation Core, is specifically
designed to facilitate the use of organoids by CMTDD investigators and the wider research community.
Organoid-based research requires an established infrastructure, considerable expertise, and a substantial
commitment of time and resources; therefore, there are significant barriers to the adoption of organoid systems
by individual laboratories. By establishing organoids, as well as providing expertise, resources, reagents and
training, the Core will remove these barriers to the use of these valuable model systems. The Core currently
holds normal and tumor PDOs from colon, rectum and small intestine, liver, breast, pancreas and prostate as
well as organoids from a number of mouse models, and plans to expand to additional tissues and diseases as
demand is identified. This biobank of normal and disease organoids from multiple tissues represents a
valuable resource for the research community at large. PDOs in the Core are associated with deidentified
clinical data and will be genetically characterized, which will aid in identification of suitable models for hypothesis
testing. The utility of the model on which the Core is built is evident from our track record under Phase 1. We
have an expanding biobank of patient and mouse-derived organoids and have established techniques for genetic
manipulation (e.g., transfection, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout), drug/toxicity testing, and biochemical and
histological analysis of organoids. The core has supported research in multiple laboratories and efforts under
Phase 1 have contributed to both publications and successful grant applications. Based on the experience
gained in Phase 1, the overall goal of the Organoid Core will be to develop a large repository of extensively
characterized organoids for use by COBRE investigators and the wider research community and to lend
expertise and reagents to promote and support the use of these structures. To accomplish this goal, the
Organoid Core will coordinate with other Center Cores and CMTDD investigators to pursue three Specific Aims:
(1) To expand and further characterize the existing Organoid Biobank, (2) To support use of organoids by
COBRE Research Project Leaders, and (3) To promote the use of organoids in ongoing research of CMTDD
investigators and the wider scientific community."
10891534,"Project Summary: Probes, Inhibitors, and PROTACs (PIP) Core
The overarching mission of the PIP Core is to use sophisticated chemistry and mass spectrometry for
development of small molecules that facilitate molecular target discovery and development. Genetic methods
are routinely used to identify, develop, and validate molecular targets. These methods rely on altering the DNA
or RNA sequences of the protein target. However, drug discovery relies on manipulating the function of the
corresponding proteins using small molecules. Often the results obtained through these complementary
strategies do not correlate.1 The incongruence associated with the results from these orthogonal approaches
can be attributed to the complex biology that is dependent on multiple functions i.e., enzymatic and scaffolding,
associated with the protein target. Modulating protein levels by altering the nucleic acids eliminates all the target
protein functions. However small molecule modulators can be tuned to induce either domain specific effects
(reversible or irreversible) or removal of the entire protein (PROTAC) with exquisite temporal control. These
could be tagged with photoactivatable or fluorescent molecules, or biotin to enable target identification and
validation, study mechanism of action, or characterize the associated interactome. In addition to the design and
synthesis of above types of small molecules, the PIP Core will also provide scale up services (mg to g) for
additional experiments such as in vivo validation of targets and hit-to-lead optimization studies to generate
structure activity relationship (SAR) data. Mass spectrometry will be used to characterize the impact of these
compounds on the proteome through quantitative analysis of proteins and posttranslational or chemical
modifications to validate mechanism of action and compensatory features that may contribute to drug resistance.
The Core will be led by Drs. Natarajan and Woods, who will bring complementary expertise to the PIP Core. Dr.
Natarajan has extensive expertise in developing probes, inhibitors, and PROTACs, using cutting edge chemistry
methods. Dr. Woods has extensive experience using mass spectrometry as a platform for delineating protein-
protein interactions, posttranslational modifications, and multivariate biomarkers of cancer response to therapy.
PIP Core services will be extensively utilized by CMTDD Research Project Leaders (RPLs), CMTDD members
and University researchers at large."
10891541,"Project Summary: ""Defining and Characterizing Drivers of Lethal Metastatic Prostate Cancer""
Prostate cancer (PC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the USA. PC is a slow growing
disease, curable if detected early. However, the treatment resistant lethal form of PC is fast growing and
metastatic. The goal of our proposed research is to identify genetic factors that are essential for the switch
from indolent to lethal metastatic PC. We have generated a unique collection of a) PC patient derived
organoids and b) primary cell lines from the tumor and metastasis of the RapidCaP mouse model for lethal PC
(PTEN and TP53 deficient). Our preliminary data highlights a fundamental shift in cellular phenotype and
growth signaling associated with the transition to metastasis. Most importantly, the loss of TAM kinase receptor
Axl is key to this metastasis associated cellular reprogramming event. These discrete cellular states are
associated with divergent signaling behavior, which enables or restricts the metastatic potential of cancer cells.
Therefore, we now focus on the receptor tyrosine kinase Axl and its control of the switch from primary to
metastatic disease in vivo. In this proposal we will mechanistically validate the role of Axl receptor in PC
cellular lineage reprogramming and maintenance of pro-metastatic phenotype (Aim 1). Next, we will assess the
effect of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on a relevant mouse model of Axl-deficient PC and perform
transcriptomic profiling to identify molecular changes occurring under the stress of ADT (Aim 2). To develop
therapeutic strategies we will use a phosphoproteome approach and identify targetable kinase dependencies
in these Axl-deficient metastatic cells (Aim 3). To execute the proposed aims, we will closely collaborate with
experts in receptor signaling and PC disease biology. Our background in mouse genetics, cell biology and
translational oncology is well aligned with the expertise required to carry out the proposed work and unravel
the genetic dependencies of lethal metastatic PC cells."
10891544,"Project Summary: “Differential Cell Size in Epithelial Packing, Homeostasis, and Disease”
A striking increase in cellular size heterogeneity is a salient feature of both organ development and cancer pro-
gression. Our goal is to discover the principles that underpin how cells with divergent sizes pack into epithelial
tissue and how alterations in cellular packing influence tissue homeostasis. The shape and size of individual
components dictate the morphology and integrity of any structure. Indeed, the regulation of cell shape through
modulation of cellular mechanical properties is a key factor in tissue morphogenesis. However, in contrast to
shape, the role of cell size in determining the form of epithelial tissues is largely unknown. This study will test the
hypothesis that cell size is a causal, rather than merely a consequential factor in epithelial homeostasis. To
determine the role of cell size in tissue packing, we will take advantage of the two distinct domains of the mouse
small intestine as a model to ask the following fundamental questions: 1) How do cells of diverse sizes pack and
maintain stereotypical organization in healthy epithelial tissues, and 2) What are the implications of packing cells
with ectopic sizes in the context of epithelial diseases. These overarching questions will be addressed with the
following Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will determine how the large Paneth cells and small Lgr5+ stem cells at the
base of the intestinal crypt domain maintain a checkerboard-like order. In Aim 2, we will interrogate how aberrant
changes in nuclear and cellular size are accommodated in the intestinal villi. Both aims will use sophisticated
genetics with quantitative biophysical approaches to determine how a shift in cell size is physically accommo-
dated in epithelial tissue. First, we will alter cellular size in a spatially and temporally controlled manner by ma-
nipulating gene expression using cell-type drivers. Subsequently, we will integrate confocal imaging with bio-
physical measurements to quantitatively distinguish the influence of cell mechanics, shape, and size in tissue
packing. By integrating highly interdisciplinary methodologies, we anticipate that our study will extend the under-
standing of how cells self-assemble into tissues with stereotypical forms and reveal how functional tissue archi-
tecture is perturbed in disease. Ultimately, the findings from this work have the potential to contribute to the
identification of novel molecular targets critical for the control of epithelial cell size, tissue packing, and disease
progression."
10934567,"Project Summary
Lung cancer remains to be a global public health priority. While low-dose computed tomography (LDCT)
screening was shown to reduce lung cancer mortality by 20-30%, there remain to be unresolved
challenges issues such as optimizing intervals for LDCT screening and how best to increase LDCT
screening uptake and adherence. In addition, it has been shown previously that lung cancer risks for
African Americans are higher than for Whites when having the same level of smoking exposure, while
uptake of LDCT screening among African Americans has been one of the lowest. Moreover, the
proportion of lung cancer among never smokers continues to rise across the world, particularly among
Asians where over 50% of lung cancers are diagnosed among never smokers. None of these emerging
issues are addressed under the recently expanded US Preventative Service Task Force criteria.
The overall objective of this project is to establish a biomarker-informed LDCT screening pathway to
maximize screening efficiency and benefit-harm ratio while accounting for racial disparity. Our research
team is in the unique position to conduct this much-needed work as we have already established
extensive resources for the data elements needed being the lead investigators of the major CT
screening programs in the US, Canada, Europe and Asia along with international lung cancer consortia.
Specifically, we will (i) Establish a biomarker-informed LDCT screening pathway accounting for
racial disparity using data and samples from 3 ongoing LDCT screening programs in North America,
with a total of 3500 participants and oversampling African Americans; (ii) Identify circulating
biomarkers that predict lung cancer risk and differentiate nodule malignancy in Asian never
smokers, using data and samples from the Taiwan Lung Cancer Screening for Never Smoker Trial
(TALENT) with 12,011 high-risk Asian never smokers and 311 lung cancer cases detected by LDCT
screening; (iii) Assess the prognostic values of biomarkers for lung cancer mortality based on
multi-omics approaches using data and samples from 6 LDCT screening studies from US, Canada,
Europe and Asia with a total of 1267 lung cancer cases.
The results from this Project will shift the paradigm of what is considered an optimal CT screening
pathway and address the need of under-represented populations and potential over-diagnosis by
investigating mortality. It will provide necessary information toward the implementation of individual risk-
profile based screening strategies that will increase efficiency, improve patient management, and reduce
lung cancer mortality in an ethnically diverse population."

10931403,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CORE 1
Nervous system tumors such as glioblastoma (GBM) remain amongst the most difficult to tumors treat. We have
been interested in using oncolytic viruses, based on herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), as a selective nervous
system tumor-killing virus. Considerable effort in the development of HSV-1 vectors has resulted in the
engineering of oncolytic HSV vectors (oHSV), such as rQNestin34.51 that are non-toxic for normal cells, yet
capable of selective replication in GBM tumor cells. To effectively use oHSV in animal tumor models it is
necessary to propagate and purify oHSV to high titers. Our efforts in process development have resulted in
scalable systems capable of manufacturing rQNestin34.5 and other oHSVs, and our protocols have been
modified by Project 4 (Yu/Caligiuri) and the City of Hope Contract Manufacturing Facility to produce cGMP-
grade oHSV-CCL5 for the upcoming Phase-I trial as part of the P01 Renewal.
The primary goal of the oHSV Production Core will be to provide large quantities of research-grade concentrated
and purified oHSV vectors for Project 1 (Glorioso; armed and unarmed rQNestin34.5v1 non-SYN and SYN),
Project 2 (Chiocca; rQNestin34.5v1 and rQNestin34.5v2), Project 3 (Kaur; oHSV-rQ1 and oHSV-P10-
aCD73mAb), and Project 4 (Caligiuri; oHSV-CCL5 and oHSV-αCD47-IgG1). Since the P01 started in 2012
we have produced, purified, and distributed over 60 oHSV stocks to the 4 projects while producing 23 MVBs
with 36 oHSV stocks produced from 2017-2022. The oHSV Production Core will continue to work with the
Projects to provide optimal vector quantity and purity while providing the support necessary to successfully
exploit the available technology. We have shown that inclusion of dextran sulfate in production increased oHSV
yield 15x, and that our stocks are devoid of contaminating exosomes. We have also engineered a cell line for
efficient BAC removal, cloned a non-adherent cell line, determined that HEK293 cells are superior to Vero-based
cells for optimal oHSV yield, and developed a novel assay to assess DNA genome containing oHSV particles.
Should any of the engineered oHSV vectors tested in the Projects prove efficacious, the oHSV Production Core
would provide support in transfer of SOPs and QA/QC assays to cGMP facilities for the production/purification
technology for large-scale oHSV manufacture for possible Phase-I human clinical trials as seen with
rQNestin34.5 and more recently with oHSV-CCL5 that underwent cGMP manufacturing by an outside vendor."

10920387,"ABSTRACT: Continuous colon motility is critical for the overall health and survival of an organism and results
from activity in the enteric nervous system (ENS) and interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) that are electrically-coupled
to smooth muscle. Although these cellular components have been individually studied in detail, how they interact
to coordinate motility across the length of colon is not well understood. Two motor patterns are measured
experimentally: (1) ‘ripple’ contractions produced by ICC slow waves of depolarization, and (2) colon migrating
motor complexes necessary for propulsion of fecal contents that require ENS activity. Existing models of colon
motility are focused on distal regions where distension from a fecal pellet activates intrinsic sensory neurons (or
IPANs) that excite ENS motor neurons for oral contraction and anal relaxation of smooth muscles; the forward
movement of the pellet then distends the adjacent segment, activates another IPAN, and this ‘neuromechanical
loop’ ensures propagation and propulsion of fecal contents. However, these models do not explain the regular
rhythm of colon motor complexes, which occur every 2-5 min, or how they are first initiated in the proximal colon
where fecal pellets have not yet formed. Unlike motor complexes that reach distal regions only when sensory
input is applied, spontaneous, rhythmic motor complexes occur in proximal regions regardless of luminal content,
stretch, or distension, indicating that the proximal colon has unique pacemaker capabilities that determine the
rhythm of motor complexes. The objective for this project is to determine and model the cellular interactions
unique to the proximal colon that are responsible for generating rhythmic motor complexes in normal and
inflamed conditions. We hypothesize that rhythmic motor complexes are due to cyclical interactions among ICC,
IPANs and motor neurons of the ENS, and that dysmotility during inflammation is due to dysregulation of these
interactions. To test this and address knowledge gaps, we will use optogenetics, calcium imaging, in situ
immunofluorescence, and computational modeling to define the cell-to-cell interactions responsible for
spontaneous, rhythmic motor complexes produced in the proximal colon and determine the cellular components
that contribute to dysrhythmic motility following inflammation. Aim 1 will determine the mechanical sensitivity of
proximal colon IPANs to ICC-generated ripple contractions. Aim 2 will define the ‘ENS neural program’ activated
by IPANs that produces motor complexes in proximal colon. Aim 3 will determine the effect of ENS activity on
ICC slow waves and ripple contractions. Each Aim will collect data from normal and inflamed colons, and findings
will be incorporated into our model to computationally test whether predictions can be made regarding motility
behavior based on changes in cellular activity. Thus, these studies will yield a novel computational model that
will help identify cellular mechanisms of dysfunction in colon diseases and guide optimization of therapeutic
devices that employ pacemaker technology or nerve stimulation to normalize and restore colon function."
10913420,"ABSTRACT
The incidence of metastatic prostate cancer has increased 3% per year since 2012, and the survival rate is
only 29%. Muscle mass is important for metastatic prostate cancer survival and quality of life (QoL). Androgen
deprivation therapy (ADT) with an androgen signaling inhibitor is the backbone of treatment for men with
metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC). But the androgen blockade diminishes muscle mass
and contributes to adverse health outcomes critical to mCSPC survivors, such as fatigue, and declines in
physical function, independence, insulin sensitivity, and QoL. Resistance training (RT) can preserve muscle
mass and improve health outcomes in non-metastatic CSPC survivors receiving ADT. The addition of creatine
monohydrate supplementation to an RT program amplifies the effects of RT in cancer-free older adults and
other clinical populations. Evidence also suggests that creatine supplementation can complement cancer
treatment. Thus, creatine monohydrate supplementation with RT (Cr+RT) is a strategy that addresses an
important knowledge gap pertaining to survivorship needs of mCSPC survivors. We hypothesize that Cr+RT
will preserve muscle mass and improve health outcomes greater than RT alone, and that creatine use will lead
to favorable changes in markers of cancer progression in mCSPC survivors receiving ADT. Here we propose a
parallel, double-blind randomized controlled trial to test the effects of 52-weeks of Cr+RT compared with
placebo (PLA) and RT (PLA+RT) with our team's established, effective, home-based, telehealth RT program
in 200 mCSPC survivors receiving ADT. We will evaluate muscle mass (primary outcome), health outcomes
(fatigue, physical function, independence, insulin sensitivity, QoL), and markers or cancer progression (PSA,
cfDNA) at baseline, 24-, and 52-weeks. RT will be carried out twice weekly with elastic resistance bands, and
we will utilize an established creatine supplementation protocol for creatine and PLA delivery. Our trial builds
on work done by our investigative team, and addresses an evidence gap listed in this RFA (CA-22-027:
Research to Understand and Address Survivorship Needs of Individuals Living with Advanced Cancer) re:
“Interventional research to determine the best ways to improve the quality of care and QoL for individuals living
with likely incurable cancer”, identified gaps in the literature, and unmet needs of mCSPC survivors. Our
approach addresses a major facilitator to RT in mCSPC survivors, a home-based RT program, while utilizing a
supervised model for safety. Our approach can be translated on a large-scale as it can be adopted by
institutions who use an established telemedicine system, and creatine monohydrate supplementation and
elastic resistance bands are inexpensive and widely available. These findings will improve delivery of
comprehensive survivorship care by providing a multicomponent, patient-centered lifestyle strategy to preserve
muscle mass, improve health outcomes and QoL, and complement cancer treatment."
10874693,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at a ~2-fold greater risk for cardiovascular
disease (CVD) and a ~7-fold greater risk for type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the decade following
pregnancy, but the underlying cause(s) of this association are relatively unstudied, and there is a paucity of
trials evaluating preventive intervention to prevent or delay this onset of disease. Microvascular dysfunction
precedes and contributes to the development of CVD and insulin resistance in humans, via reductions in
endothelial-derived nitric oxide (NO) and insulin-mediated NO-dependent vascular responses, respectively. We
have demonstrated that endothelium- and nitric oxide-dependent dilation are attenuated in the
microvasculature of otherwise healthy women with a history of GDM and this reduction is mediated, in part, by
increased oxidative stress. However, the degree to which this attenuation in dilation extends to microvascular
insulin-mediated responses is unknown. Therefore, in aim 1, we propose a comprehensive examination of the
role of oxidative stress in attenuated microvascular endothelial insulin sensitivity in otherwise healthy women
who have had GDM. Our preliminary data suggest that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase
(NADPH oxidase) contributes significantly to elevated reactive oxygen species after GDM, and that inhibiting
NADPH oxidase improves endothelial- and NO-dependent dilation, in vivo in these women. Therefore, in aim
2, we propose a comprehensive examination of the role of NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species --
which represent a future pharmacological target for the highly specific treatment and reversal of preclinical
vascular dysfunction after GDM -- in attenuated microvascular endothelial function in these women. Metformin
treatment improves vascular endothelial function and microvascular insulin sensitivity in patients at risk for
T2DM, in part through reductions in oxidative stress, suggesting that metformin treatment applied before the
onset of insulin resistance may improve microvascular endothelial responses in women with a history of GDM.
Therefore, in aim 3, we propose to examine the acute and chronic effects of metformin treatment on oxidative
stress-mediated mechanisms of microvascular dysfunction in otherwise healthy women with a history of GDM.
Overall, using an innovative translational human approach that combines in vivo pharmaco-dissection of
mechanisms of vascular function with the biochemical analysis of biopsied endothelial cells, the experiments
proposed herein will provide novel understanding of 1) early vascular mechanisms preceding the development
of overt cardiovascular and metabolic disease in women who have had GDM , and 2) mechanistically delineate
the efficacy of a readily available, safe, and inexpensive treatment to restore microvascular function before the
onset of disease in this high-risk cohort of women."

 Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the gold standard for the diagnosis and monitoring of retinal and
optic nerve diseases. Clinical OCT systems (large tabletop devices with chinrest) require a compliant subject,
and thus are not suitable for use with infants, young children, and patients who are unable to cooperate for eye
imaging (such as from physical disability or while under anesthesia or in intensive care). As many of these
patients cannot communicate about vision disturbance or vision loss, diagnosis of disease is difficult to achieve
before irrevocable vision loss occurs. One example of this population is preterm infants in intensive care and
who are at risk for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). While handheld OCT (HH-OCT) has led to significant
insights into the development of ROP, its use for disease screening has been limited in part due to poor
usability of the existing commercial systems due to weight, ergonomics and speed of imaging. The need for
image-based classification of ROP was a subject of the recent International Classification of ROP Committee.
There is a clear need for a commercial, point of care, high-speed, user-friendly handheld OCT system to
improve the standard of care for infants, young children, and patients who are unable to cooperate for imaging.
 Theia Imaging is pursuing commercialization of the Theia 2 high-speed, portable, user-friendly, hand-held
OCT system for use in these patients. Our long-term objective is to enable clinicians and researchers to gather
much-needed OCT imaging of the retina and/or optic nerve head in their patients. This will decrease the need
for examinations under anesthesia and simplify access to valuable information about the retina and optic nerve
head at the time of eye care and general health care.
 This Phase II effort will build on the Theia 1 system developed in the Phase I, to result in an FDA-
submission for a handheld system that is lightweight, with a small, ergonomic handpiece and imaging at high
speed and a robust commercialization pathway. Theia Imaging will achieve this through the following Aims:
Aim 1: Refine the T1 Prototype into a Commercial Medical Device. We will refine both the design of the probe
and OCT engine allowing us to scale to production quantities and reduce the overall cost of the device. Aim 2:
Refine the T1 Software into a Commercial Product. We will refine this software under a software quality
assurance system and improve usability. Aim 3: Pilot Study, Pivotal Study and 510(k) Submission. With the
refined Theia 2 system, we will execute pilot and pivotal human studies in support of a 510(k) submission The
expected outcome of this proposal is the development of a commercially viable, 300 kHz HH-OCT system and
a 510(k) submission for FDA clearance of the device. Both the device and associated software will be
designed to be usable by ophthalmic technicians without the need for specialized training."
10903863,"SUMMARY (Project 1)
 Our long-term goal is to identify the structural and functional features responsible for HDL’s cardioprotective
functions in humans, which may have important implications for predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk
and developing therapeutics targeted to HDL. The main goal of Project 1 is to determine the impact of specific
subspecies of HDL on cardiovascular risk in humans and to determine the factors that govern the sizes of HDL
in vivo. The central hypothesis is that different sizes of HDL have very different abilities to promote
cholesterol efflux from macrophages by the ABCA1 pathway.
 We recently showed that smaller HDLs promote cholesterol efflux by the ABCA1 pathway much more
strongly than larger forms of HDL. Moreover, in a study of over 550 heart-healthy patients with type 1 diabetes
(T1D), we found that a low level of extra-small HDL was the strongest predictor of an increased risk of cardiac
death, revascularization, and MI. Using chemical crosslinking, proteolysis, and MS/MS analysis, we
demonstrated that apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1) forms two isomers (LL5/5 and LL5/4), which we termed
rotamers, in human HDL. Expression of the LL5/4 rotamer in mice selectively elevated levels of extra-small
HDL with enhanced cholesterol efflux capacity.
 Based on these observations, we propose two specific aims. Aim 1 will extend our observations in patients
with T1D to patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Using state-of-the art methods we developed to measure the
concentration of total HDL (HDL-P) and the sizes and concentrations of four HDL subspecies (extra-small,
small-, medium- and large-HDL), we will determine if specific sizes of HDL predict CVD risk more strongly than
total HDL-P and independently of traditional lipid-risk factors in 500 patients with T2D in Look AHEAD, a
prospective study of incident CVD risk. We will complement these studies by determining whether low levels of
extra-small HDL predict incident CVD risk in a validation cohort of T1D patients. We will also determine if
cholesterol efflux capacity, HDL oxidation, and HDL’s anti-inflammatory properties predict CVD risk. Aim 2 will
determine the impact of the two major APOA1 rotamers on the sizes and concentrations of HDL, cholesterol
efflux capacity of HDL, and atherosclerosis in humanized mouse models. Because we previously showed that
low levels of extra-small HDL strongly predict incident CVD in patients with T1D, we will study both nondiabetic
and diabetic mice, using a validated mouse model of T1D. We will complement our mouse mechanistic studies
by analyzing the association between rotamer distribution and CVD risk in patients with T1D and T2D.
 The demonstration that HDL’s structural features associate with its size, function, and CVD risk will provide
mechanistic and translational insights into HDL’s cardioprotective functions."
10888333,"Proteomics and Lipidomics Core (C. Vary, Core Director)
The Proteomics and Lipidomics Core is led by Calvin Vary PhD and provides high quality research design
support, sample preparation, mass spectrometry analysis, data collection, and data analysis for a variety of
tissues and cells. As a component of the COBRE in Mesenchymal and Neural Regulation of Metabolic
Networks since 2017, our services have focused on protein and lipid profiling in mouse and human tissues.
Our goals remain to: 1) provide new approaches that expand previous protein identification capabilities, 2)
provide unbiased analytic workflows for proteomics and lipidomics studies that include 3) further developing
targeted protein (e.g., MRMHR, SRM) and lipid quantitation (MSMSALL, MPIS) workflows, and 4) provide
improved statistical and informatics approaches for data interpretation and identification of mechanisms.
In Phase I of this COBRE, the Proteomics and Lipidomics Core consistently supported basic, translational, and
clinical research projects and grant applications. These have included young investigator-initiated COBRE
projects, COBRE pilot projects, and other NIH research applications, both within and outside of MaineHealth
Institute for Research. A significant Phase I accomplishment was the award of an NIH S10 shared instrument
grant in support of a new high resolution TripleToF mass spectrometer, liquid chromatograph, and other
support equipment. MaineHealth provided institutional funds to renovate the facility, which consolidated the
current and new equipment in a more efficient footprint. This support has increased our capacity, efficiency,
and flexibility by allowing expanded proteomics and lipidomics workflows and increased user access, while
providing new opportunities to support ongoing research and training for internal and external users. In phase
I, we recruited an outstanding mass spectrometry technology manager, Carlos Gartner PhD, who brought
expertise that includes mass spectrometry instrumentation and advanced liquid chromatography. We also
recruited Yulica Santos-Ortega, PhD as a research associate with mass spectrometry-based cardiovascular
proteomics experience. New Phase II opportunities include exploitation of human proteome-wide selected
reaction monitoring protocols using on-line data repositories that will be implemented on new instrumentation
(Sciex QTRAP 6500+). We continue to be uniquely positioned as the only regional facility of its kind providing
these services for scientific inquiry and in support of student, investigator, and staff training. Within this
COBRE, these resources will be critical for promoting junior investigator advancement. This core will advance
our understanding of the properties of thermogenic adipocyte lineages and roles in energy balance (Project 1,
M. Lynes), provide insight into the role of the X/A cell secretome on bariatric surgery-related bone loss (Project
2, Z. Li). This core will also be well positioned to support PI progress and future exploratory directions for
identification of modifiable risk factors in cardiometabolic disease (Project 3, I. Agarwal)."

10923925,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The United States is in the midst of a serious opioid epidemic, with 107,622 drug overdose causalities
in 2021. An astounding 1 in 5 Americans have chronic pain, and prescription opioid medication for chronic pain
treatment has more than tripled between 1999 and 2015. Research is needed to develop and test safe
alternatives to opioids for the treatment of chronic pain. The purpose of this project is to examine one such
option: open-label (i.e. honest) placebos (OLPs). While placebos are typically used in control conditions to test
against active treatment, research across a variety of clinical trials has shown that placebos, even when given
without deception or concealment, can effectively treat chronic pain. Typically, participants enrolled in OLP
trials receive a that explains why placebos are effective; the rationales are based on a 15-minute 4-
point discussion between the researcher/provider and participant. However, no research has systematically
examined what types of rationales for OLPs promote the most symptom relief. An optimized open-label
placebo rationale for chronic pain has the potential to greatly improve OLP efficacy. Participants (n=340 at
baseline) in the proposed project will be patients with chronic pain who use opioids. They will be assigned to
one of four conditions: an evidence-based rationale condition, where the placebo rationale is adapted
heavily from prior OLP studies, b) a mindfulness rationale condition, where participants are asked to accept
any unpleasant sensations and visualize the placebo pill washing away pain, c) a no rationale control
condition, where participants receive OLPs in the absence of a rationale, and d) a no treatment control
condition where participants do not receive a placebo. Participants in conditions a-c will be asked to take 2
placebos per day, honestly described as placebos, for 21 days. All participants will be assessed at baseline,
mid-point (11 days after OLP use), and two-follow-up periods (at the very end of OLP use and 28 days after
the end of OLP use). All assessments and rationales will occur remotely through teleconferencing, and all
placebos will be distributed by mail. Study outcomes are opioid use and pain."

Severe inequities in depression and its diagnosis and treatment among rural-dwelling, racial/ethnic minority
seniors compared to their urban White counterparts result in increased mortality, cognitive impairment, and
multiple co-morbidities, thus presenting a growing public health concern as the United States population ages.
These health inequities are often attributable to social and environmental factors, including economic insecurity,
histories of trauma, chronic gaps in transportation and safety-net services (e.g., food assistance, health care),
and disparities in access to policymaking processes rooted in colonialism that make these groups “structurally
vulnerable” to mental ill health. Fewer data exist on protective factors associated with social and environmental
contexts, such as proximity of social support, community attachment, and a meaningful sense of place. While
the importance of such place-based factors is widely recognized in scholarship on the social determinants of
health, there is to date little research specifically examining how such factors shape disparities in depression
and treatment, as well as limited practical approaches to target these factors and their effects on mental wellbeing
for rural and minority populations. This K99/R00 application proposes to integrate my expertise as a cultural
anthropologist in participatory qualitative research and implementation science with new knowledge in rural
mental health research, quantitative and mixed-method designs, and intervention development, in order to
conceptualize and intervene on the social and environmental causes of mental health disparities. Coursework,
workshops, and the expertise of an interdisciplinary team of mentors at the Pacific Institute for Research and
Evaluation and the University of New Mexico during the K99 period will provide me with the skills to undertake
the proposed R00 research, which will utilize quantitative surveys, qualitative interviews, ecological network
research, and spatial data analysis to elucidate how place-based vulnerabilities and protective factors shape
experiences of depression among rural American Indian and Latinx elders in New Mexico. Guided by Intervention
Mapping, a participatory approach for planning health interventions, data will contribute to a community-driven
plan for a multisystem intervention targeting the place-based causes of disparities in depression, which will form
the basis of a subsequent R01 implementation and evaluation study. This participatory and interdisciplinary study
will elucidate how axes of difference pertaining to place, rurality, and minority status drive mental health
disparities. The resulting place-focused intervention plan will improve mental health equity for aging populations
that data show are severely and persistently underserved and advance the science of intervention and
implementation beyond its predominant focus on individuals and healthcare settings. Data and training will
contribute to my independence as an investigator focused on the social causes of health disparities and translate
directly into future NIH-funded research targeting the upstream causes of mental health disparities in this and
other underserved populations."
10903851,"SUMMARY (Entire PPG)
 The development of new cardioprotective drugs and accurate metrics for cardiovascular risk is being
hindered, we believe, by the failure to correctly identify the cardioprotective forms of high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) and inadequate knowledge about the mechanisms that remove cholesterol from the artery wall. This
renewal application will address these issues by continuing dynamic interactions among seven world-class
scientists who study HDL from diverse, but complementary, viewpoints. HDL, an important mediator of
cholesterol transport, is created when its most abundant scaffold protein, apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1), interacts
with ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). This process is critical for removing cholesterol from
macrophages. Indeed, the capacity for human plasma HDL to promote cholesterol efflux (CEC) is more
diagnostic for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk than the traditional measure of HDL’s cholesterol content. The
central hypothesis of this multidisciplinary Program Project Grant is that ABCA1 engages in highly specific
interactions with APOA1 particles that may or may not contain lipid to produce cardioprotective HDL. Our
objective is to derive a molecular understanding of this pathway and the roles played by HDL subspecies in
the setting of diabetes. We will use three general overlapping approaches: 1) calibrated ion mobility
spectrometry to relate the size and number of specific HDL particles to CEC and CVD risk in diabetic patients,
2) detailed in vitro mechanistic approaches to unravel the factors that allow specific lipidated HDL particles to
interact with ABCA1, and 3) cryo-EM and computational studies of the structure and mechanism of ABCA1’s
action. Our plan focuses on three Projects at four sites: Project 1: Cardioprotection by extra-small HDL
particles – Jay Heinecke, Project Leader; Karin Bornfeldt, Co-I (University of Washington); Project 2:
Mechanism of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux to lipidated HDL – W. Sean Davidson, Project Leader
and PPG Principal Investigator (University of Cincinnati); Project 3: Mechanisms of
phospholipid/cholesterol translocation by ABCA1 – Jere Segrest, Project Leader (Vanderbilt University);
Steve Aller, Co-I (University of Alabama at Birmingham). Additionally, four core facilities will drive scientific
synergy and cost-effective use of NIH resources: Core A: Administration – W. Sean Davidson, Core Leader,
will provide administrative support for the Program. Core B: Computational Biology – Jere Segrest, Core
Leader, will perform molecular modeling, homology modeling, and double/single state normal mode analyses
for structural studies. Core C: Lipoprotein Quantitation and Function – Tomas Vaisar, Core Leader;
Chongren Tang, Co-I, will quantify i) HDL particle number (the sizes and concentrations of HDL particles) and
ii) the cholesterol efflux capacity of various HDLs and ABCA1 mutants. Core D: Apo/Lipoprotein Production
– W. Sean Davidson, Core Leader, will supply the Program with high-quality apolipoproteins, customized
mutants, and lipoprotein samples, both recombinantly derived and isolated from human plasma."

HIV prevention requires improvements in effectiveness, reduction of side-effects, and removing barriers
to adherence for antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Evaluation of these improvements
through randomized trials remains difficult due to sample size requirements, strict eligibility criteria, and
assessments limited to active comparators. Addressing these challenges has made novel analytical
approaches increasingly necessary. The proposed research will use cutting-edge quantitative methods
to evaluate new PrEP combinations by combining diverse sources of information. Data from the HIV
Prevention Trials Network 083 and iPrEx (Preexposure Prophylaxis Initiative) trials will be used to
compare long-acting injectable cabotegravir PrEP to placebo among men who have sex with men and
transgender women. Results will provide a reliable estimate of the efficacy of long-acting injectable
cabotegravir in lieu of direct randomized comparisons, which are not forthcoming. Next, data from the
VOICE (Vaginal and Oral Interventions to Control the Epidemic) trial will be integrated with subject-
matter expert knowledge through statistical and mechanistic modeling to evaluate the expected efficacy
of tenofovir alafenamide and emtricitabine daily oral PrEP among cisgender women. Results from this
second analysis can aid in the planning of randomized trials of tenofovir alafenamide in cisgender
women (e.g., assess whether a planned trial would likely fail to demonstrate efficacy under previously
observed adherence patterns). Finally, flexible analytic tools to apply the quantitative methods used in
the proposed research will be developed and made freely available through open-source software.
Provision of these tools will decrease barriers to future applications. Scientific results from this proposal
will accelerate and strengthen how we can learn from randomized trials and make strides in the
prevention of HIV. The candidate will benefit from strong mentorship and additional training in HIV
epidemiology, mechanistic modeling, semiparametric theory, and guided development as an
independent scientist. Through additional quantitative methods training, the candidate will be uniquely
prepared to jointly use statistical and mechanistic modeling to bring field-specific strengths to address
deficiencies that neither field can easily address on its own. Completion of the training and research
aims of this mentored developmental award will situate the candidate at the forefront of HIV
epidemiology and methodological research and prepare the candidate to become to an independent
researcher."

10923913,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Rates of new HIV infections are disproportionately high, and uptake of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) low, in
Black, Latino/a/x, and uninsured individuals in the US. Healthcare providers in community health centers
(CHCs) could play a critical role in increasing PrEP prescribing to racial and ethnic minorities and other
underserved populations. However, providers face barriers to PrEP prescribing, such as difficulty identifying
candidates for PrEP; discomfort discussing sexual behavior; implicit biases about sexuality, race, and
substance use; and lack of familiarity with PrEP care. We have found that providers are enthusiastic about the
potential benefits of decision support tools to mitigate these barriers to PrEP provision, and that patients would
find such tools acceptable if implemented sensitively. We previously showed that data from electronic health
records (EHRs) can be used to identify patients at increased risk of HIV acquisition in two large, general
practice healthcare systems. In our formative R34 research, we expanded on this approach in a safety-net
setting, incorporating strategies to support not only identification of PrEP candidates but also PrEP discussions
and prescribing. In a national network of CHCs serving 6.2 million patients in 46 states (OCHIN), we used
machine learning with EHR data to identify patients at increased risk for incident HIV diagnosis (area under the
curve 0.84). Using stakeholder-engaged qualitative methods, we then built an EHR-based decision support
tool that uses our prediction model to prompt PrEP discussions with patients likely to benefit. The tool features
a suite of resources to support initial PrEP prescribing, including suggested language for patient-centered
discussions; information about PrEP indications, formulations, and dosing; laboratory order sets; diagnosis
codes; and automated clinical notes. We piloted this tool at 3 CHCs, establishing feasibility and acceptability.
We now propose Predictive Analytics and Clinical Decision Support to Improve PrEP Prescribing in
Community Health Centers (PrEDICT) to evaluate the impact of our tool on PrEP provision in OCHIN CHCs.
Our specific aims are to 1) expand and refine the decision support tool to facilitate PrEP follow-up care, and
therefore patients’ persistence on PrEP; 2) quantify the impact of the decision support tool on PrEP initiation
and persistence in a pragmatic stepped-wedge trial across 16 CHCs; and 3) identify patient populations with
whom providers are less inclined to discuss PrEP when prompted to do so, and explore facilitators and barriers
to equitable selection of patients for PrEP discussions. We will engage a diverse advisory group of patients
from OCHIN CHCs in tool expansion, refinement, and implementation. This project is innovative in its use of
predictive analytics and decision support to improve PrEP provision in safety-net settings. The research is
significant because it has the potential to facilitate large increases in PrEP utilization using highly scalable
tools. Our intervention addresses NIH priorities, aligns with the federal Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative, and
could become a best practice for how CHCs and other healthcare systems support PrEP care delivery."
10931397,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that affects 1 in 300 people by the age of 18 in the US. T1D is
characterized by acute onset of hyperglycemia resulting from immune-mediated destruction of the insulin-
producing β-cells in the pancreas. There is currently no cure for T1D and the disease requires constant
management where the current standard of care/management is injected or pumped insulin. Thus, there is an
urgent need for new and effective treatment options for T1D patients. While self-reactive CD4 and CD8 T cells
are central pathogenic drivers, regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been shown to restrain autoimmunity and maintain
immune tolerance through multiple mechanisms. In T1D patients, impaired Treg function have been shown to
contribute to disease susceptibility. Thus, induction of Tregs holds great promise in correcting the aberrant
autoreactive T cell activities and preventing the progression of T1D. However, it remains unknown how to induce
Tregs in a safe and effective manner for the potential treatment of T1D. Here, we propose to develop a novel
strategy for immunotherapy against T1D. Toward this goal, we have developed synthetic high-density lipoprotein
NanoDiscs that are particularly well suited for lymph node targeting. Our preliminary data generated in a murine
model of T1D and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis have shown that NanoDiscs carrying antigens
only induce robust Treg response and achieve immune tolerance. Based on our compelling proof-of-concept
data, we propose to develop NanoDiscs carrying antigens to promote antigen-specific immune tolerance against
T1D. The proposed research will provide a new strategy for modulating immune microenvironment of pancreas
and an avenue for immune tolerance against T1D."

Snakebite envenoming poses a global risk to human health. For over 125 years, antivenoms have consisted of
animal-derived polyclonal serum immunoglobulin G (IgG). In recent decades, IgG digested into antigen-binding
fragments Fab(2) has been found to reduce some of the most severe side-effects of non-human antivenom.
These antivenoms are obtained by immunizing horses or sheep with individual snake venom, in order to produce
a product that is effective only against those specific snake species. There are currently over 40 antivenom
products against individual snake species, and these treatments all present several challenges, including early-
onset adverse reactions to animal plasma derived antivenoms, shortened half-life, need for repeated intravenous
(IV) infusion by medical personnel, and correct identification of the specific snake. In contrast, human
recombinant broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) capable of recognizing shared toxins found across all snake
venoms would enable the production of a single broad-spectrum product to treat all snakebite. Human IgG bnAbs
would avoid the serum sickness and anaphylaxis risk inherent to non-human antivenom, making possible safe
use of intramuscular (IM) delivery and field deployment of a full IgG product with a 3-week half-life. We will extend
our work from the Phase I, where fully-human, bnAbs identified from a unique antibody repertoire were
characterized and validated to have broad in vivo efficacy. Now, Centivax will complete the discovery of bnAbs
against the remaining key toxins common to all snake venom, for the development of VenPen, a broad-spectrum,
thermostabilized, lyophilized, fully human-derived antivenom, with reduced need for refrigeration or training and
capable of IM delivery a field-deployable dual-chamber injector. Uniquely, these antibodies were isolated from a
unique hyper-immune subject whose immune system has developed broadly neutralizing, highly-specialized
anti-snake venom antibodies through a history of documented escalating dose self-immunizations over 17+
years with diverse snake venoms. Centivax is well on the way to developing VenPen universal antivenom, with
one broadly-neutralizing in vivo protective antibody to long-neurotoxins already developed and bnAbs to the
other four most dangerous toxins in various stages of development. Aim 1: Complete the development of the
elapid cocktail by identifying bnAbs against the remaining dominant toxins in the Elapidae snake family and
demonstrate protection in vivo against whole venom of diverse elapid snake genera of medical consequence.
Aim 2: Complete the development of identifying bnAbs against dominant toxins in the Viperidae family, and
characterize the protection in vivo against diverse genera of viperids of medical consequence. Aim 3: Combine
and formulate the final VenPen bnAb cocktail for lyophilization for use in both IV vials as well as rapid IM delivery
dual chamber auto-injector. The potential benefits and applications of a thermostabilized, broadly neutralizing
anti-venom are far reaching including maximizing protection of all Americans exposed to snakebite, U.S. military
personnel deployed both nationally and abroad, and rural communities worldwide."
10911129,"Project Summary/Abstract
Urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) is a biomarker of falls risk and disproportionately affects older minority
women living in urban communities. Over 50% of an estimated 10 million women age 70 and older with UUI will
experience a fall. A fall compounds the functional dependency already present in older women with UUI making
their quality of life worse than that following a stroke. This proposal addresses a key research gap: existing fall
prevention interventions cannot be applied to women with UUI and effective interventions that reduce falls in
older community-dwelling women with UUI are lacking. Our objective is to establish the effectiveness of a novel
multidimensional intervention to reduce falls in older women with UUI. This intervention is based on the
hypothesis that falls in older adult women with urinary incontinence are the result of urinary urgency related
anxiety in the setting of reduced lower limb muscle strength, poor balance, and environmental hazards. Our trial
will show that a tailored intervention that addresses each of these interdependent factors through integrated
behavioral bladder training and urge suppression, strength and balance exercises, and home hazard
assessment will reduce falls and improve urinary incontinence in older community-dwelling women with UUI.
The investigators of this proposal have already developed and validated the intervention in pilot studies and now
propose a randomized controlled trial of 314 women to rigorously establish its effectiveness. Our specific aims
are: 1) To determine the effect of a tailored integrated exercise and bladder training intervention on falls in older
women and 2) To determine the effect of a tailored integrated exercise and bladder training intervention on
urgency urinary incontinence in older women. The trial will use a community-engagement approach to recruit
women living in an urban core community with high proportion of minorities. This trial will be the first adequately
powered study to test an intervention for reducing falls in older community-dwelling women with urgency urinary
incontinence and also the first adequately powered study to test the efficacy of a physical exercise intervention
for the treatment of urinary incontinence. This study will have significant public health impact because it will
establish the clinical effectiveness of a scalable intervention that targets two common highly morbid conditions:
falls and incontinence in older women."

Clinical outcome in MDS and AML has not significantly improved over the past 50 years and cure rates remain
below 15% in the majority of patients (~85%) which are >55 years of age. Fundamentally novel approaches are
urgently needed to improve our understanding of disease pathogenesis and to enable more effective therapeutic
intervention. Evidence over the past 10 years has shown that MDS and AML arise from preleukemic stem cells
(preL-SC), preceding the formation of fully transformed leukemia stem cells (LSC). Recent work has uncovered
considerable subclonal heterogeneity of preL-SC in MDS and AML and has indicated that stem cell subclonal
complexity plays a key role in pathogenesis, progression, and therapeutic resistance. However, the molecular
and cellular mechanisms governing these processes are still largely unknown. Transcription factors (TF) have
long been recognized as critical regulators of normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Specifically, in MDS and
AML transcriptional dysregulation is key to confer the pathognomonic features of cellular dysplasia and a myeloid
differentiation block. Cell fate and differentiation decisions as well as the induction of a myeloid bias at the stem
cell and multipotent progenitor level, which is one of the earliest cellular properties detected in preL-SC, are
governed by transcription factors. In addition, our recent work has discovered an unexpected degree of
transcription dynamics and plasticity in hematopoietic stem and progenitors, and that both transcriptional
plasticity and transcriptional memory are dysregulated in preL-SC and LSC. Our major research questions/goals
are to understand stem cell subclonal dynamics and their regulation in the initiation and progression of MDS and
AML, to identify and study mechanisms of transcriptional cooperativity in pre-leukemic stem cells and their
therapeutic targeting, and to study transcription dynamics and pre-LSC fate dysregulation at a single-cell and
single-molecule resolution. To accomplish these goals we will utilize novel tools for stem cell subclonal analysis
in patients, as well as newly developed longitudinal mouse genetic models of preL-SC progression to MDS and
AML. In addition, we will leverage recent advances in our ability to directly target key transcription factors by
novel first-in-class pharmacological inhibitors, as well as novel experimental tools for the study of transcription
dynamics at a single-molecule level in primary stem/progenitor cells from murine models and patients. Overall,
our research will delineate the molecular regulation of pre-cancerous cell states in MDS and AML pathogenesis.
This will enable their therapeutic targeting, in addition to the elimination of the fully-transformed leukemic clones.
Such an approach holds the promise of achieving lasting remissions and potentially cure of MDS and AML. Our
long-term vision is that, once we understand the early transformation-initiating mechanisms in pre-cancerous
stem cells, it may even be possible to target such pre-cancerous states before the onset of overt leukemia and
thus prevent transformation."
10807062,"Despite progress over the past 50 years in lowering the rate of smoking, tobacco use remains the leading cause
of premature death in the US. To ensure the sustained and impactful research dedicated to addressing tobacco
use, rigorous inter-disciplinary mentoring programs are needed to prepare the next generation of researchers
committed to patient-oriented research (POR) in this area. I have led a successful research program focused on
testing methods to improve the use and effectiveness of treatments for tobacco for 21 years. For the first cycle
of my K24, my primary mentorship goal was to train in mentorship and to formalize and enhance the mentoring
activities that I had been engaged in from 2001-2017 into a structured, consistent, and comprehensive mentoring
program in tobacco POR for students, fellows, and junior faculty. With K24 support over the past 4 years, I
provided training to 21 new mentees, yielding 50 papers with mentees and 7 papers under review or in revision
(>230 total by mentees) and 32 grants, including 5 Ks and 11 R01s, 3 as a New Investigator PI, compared to 25
mentees, 34 publications with mentees, and 2 Ks and 2 R01s in the preceding 17 years. For the first cycle of the
K24, my primary research goal was to augment my tobacco POR by building expertise in implementation
science through training and by pilot testing use of the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) – a genetically-informed
biomarker of nicotine metabolism rate – for personalizing tobacco treatment as an implementation strategy to
increase use of tobacco treatments. K24 support over the past 4 years, led to six new grants in tobacco and
implementation science, 4 focused on testing the NMR in clinical practice: HIV care, primary care, and in-patients
(R01 CA243914; U54 GM104941; P50 CA244690; R01 HG012670; SAP#4100083101; R01 DA056050). I
leveraged this research in implementation science to augment my mentoring by serving as faculty on two national
implementation science training programs – NCI's Training Institute for Dissemination and Implementation
Research in Cancer and Washington University at St. Louis's Institute for Implementation Science Scholars –
and by serving as co-chair for the Cancer Center Cessation Initiative's Implementation Science Working Group.
In this renewal, I will: 1) sustain the mentoring program in tobacco and implementation science POR that I
established with the first K24 cycle, using a structured, comprehensive, and individualized approach for an
additional 15 mentees; and 2) augment our tobacco and implementation science POR by conducting a pilot
study to develop messages informed by behavioral economics for HIV+ patients and infectious disease clinicians
that are related to intention to refer for (clinician) or engage with (patient) tobacco use treatment and then test
the impact of these messages integrated into the electronic health record as implementation science strategies
to increase actual referral for and engagement in tobacco treatment in the HIV clinical setting. This renewal will
ensure that I continue to provide the mentoring needed to build the next generation of scientists to address
tobacco use and to continue to grow my impactful research in tobacco control and implementation science."

10891549,"Project Summary: ""Targeting ASAP1-Controlled Signal Pathways to Inhibit Uveal Melanoma
Metastasis""
Uveal melanoma (UM) accounts for about 5% of all melanomas and has an incidence of 4-11 per million
people per year in western countries. Although much has been learned about the signaling pathways that
control UM oncogenesis, far less is known about the pathways that control metastatic disease. Preventing or
effectively treating metastatic disease is critical because it occurs in about 50% of patients (most often in the
liver) and once present, the prognosis is dismal. Amplification of chromosome 8q is one of the strong
predictors of metastatic disease. ASAP1, which is located on chromosome 8q, has been shown to control
metastasis in breast cancer. ASAP1 is amplified in about 40% of UM patients, and increased ASAP1
expression levels are associated with increased metastasis and poor prognosis. Overexpression of ASAP1
in low-grade tumor cells increases cell migration in an in vitro wound-healing assay. Furthermore, ASAP1
has been implicated in the metastasis of several cancers and is thought to promote metastasis by directly
controlling the remodeling of the cytoskeletal architecture. We have recently begun to explore the molecular
pathways that control uveal melanoma metastasis and have preliminary data showing that ASAP1 controls
uveal melanoma cell invasion, proliferation, and metastasis in an orthotopic xenograft model of human uveal
melanoma. Furthermore, we have identified several tumor-associated transcription factors, including STAT4,
COUP-TF I, and COUP-TF II, that are activated by overexpression of ASAP1 in UM cells, suggesting a novel
mechanism by which ASAP1 may also control UM metastasis. Therefore, we hypothesize that ASAP1
promotes uveal melanoma metastasis by activating signaling pathways that induce tumor-associated
transcription factors and that inhibiting these pathways by pharmacologic inhibition will significantly reduce
metastatic disease. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing two aims. In Aim 1, we will identify ASAP1
domain(s) that promote UM cell invasion and proliferation. These studies will involve expressing full-length
ASAP1 and its serial deletion constructs following ASAP1 knockdown to determine the role of ASAP1
domains in UM cells. In Aim 2, we will assess the function of ASAP1-controlled transcription factor(s) in
uveal melanoma cell invasion, proliferation, and tumor metastasis. Cell culture experiments will involve either
knockdown of gene expression or pharmacological inhibition to determine the role of these transcription
factors in UM cells. In vivo experiments will determine whether pharmacologic inhibition of ASAP1- activated
transcription factors reduce tumor progression and metastasis in a xenograft model of human UM. For these
studies, we will use JAK inhibitors and CIA1, which inhibit STAT4 and COUP-TF II, respectively. This
research should provide us with new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying metastatic spread of
UM and may lead to novel approaches to prevent or treat metastatic UM."
10932190,"Breast Oncology Program: Summary/Abstract
The goal of the HDFCCC Breast Oncology (BR) Program is to reduce the risk of breast cancer development,
progression, and mortality using innovative approaches and novel methodologies to reveal the molecular,
cellular, and targetable networks that underlie susceptibility, heterogeneity, and outcome disparities. The
translational nature of the program means that laboratory-based work in the program can be rapidly moved into
clinical trials. The clinical research of the BR Program includes reducing overdiagnosis, over- and under-
treatment, and the burden of cancer therapy through risk assessment to individualize screening and prevention
measures, and through improved tumor classification to tailor treatment. BR research focuses on three areas:
(1) understanding how tumor heterogeneity contributes to metastasis, dormancy, and therapeutic resistance;
(2) developing new therapeutic strategies using innovation in trial design and drug development; and (3) better
characterizing early breast lesions to improve screening, prevention, and health care value."
10914218,"The overall goal of this project is to develop novel mathematic methods and toolkits to connect cell fate
transition and epigenetic regulation across tissues and diseases. Cell fate transition often occurs in organ
development, tissue regeneration, and pathogenesis. Dysregulation of the cell fate transition can lead to
abnormal development or diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, heart failure, and Alzheimer’s disease.
Quantitively decoding how cell fate changes can provide novel mechanistic insight into organogenesis and
tissue regeneration, and help identify new strategies for the treatment of human diseases. However, our
knowledge of cell fate transition and its regulation is only the tip of the iceberg due to the impracticality of long-
term tracing of cell transcriptomes. In the past decade, numerous single-cell atlases containing millions of cells
in different tissues, organs, developmental stages, and biological conditions are routinely developed by
consortia such as the Human Cell Atlas (HCA). These atlases provide an opportunity for the unbiased study of
cellular dynamics and the regulation mechanism. The lack of computational methods presents a major
knowledge gap in the understanding of cell dynamics and the regulation leveraging by those large reference
atlases. To address this knowledge gap, we proposed a new concept of “reference-based cellular dynamic
inference”, which is a novel strategy to automatically annotate the cell state transition in new datasets by
learning from the appropriate reference, allowing us to easily perform comparative analysis among different
tissues and disease conditions. In this project, we will pursue three parallel but complementary research
directions: 1) to develop the first computational methods and toolkits for generating cell dynamics atlases and
analyzing cell state transition based on the appropriate reference atlases; 2) to develop novel statistical models
for studying epigenetic regulation of cell fate from single-cell multiomics data; 3) to generate the first dynamic
reference landscapes of cell differentiation, such as cardiogenesis, hematopoiesis, and neurogenesis, and in-
house landscapes of transdifferentiation. This project will be built on the foundation of our recent studies for the
development of computational approaches to uncover cell state transition from single-cell transcriptomes in
both homogeneous and heterogeneous cell populations and the studies for investigating the role of epigenetic
regulation on cell fate transition. The proposed studies will generate advanced computational toolkits and
broadly applicable dynamic reference atlases, which are expected to reveal profound mechanisms controlling
cell state transition in health and disease. In the long term, the ability to build cell dynamics reference
landscapes will open a new horizon to understand the diversity of cell fate through comparative analyses
across tissues and diseases and enhance regenerative medicine."
11081824,"Project Summary
The goal of this Fast Track STTR project is to determine proof-of-principle and efficacy
of a novel blood brain barrier (BBB) penetrating therapeutic nanoparticle for the potential
treatment of otherwise intractable brain tumors like glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). This
project seeks to demonstrate that novel, targetable nanoparticles can delivery
therapeutic substances to human brain tumor cells and reduce tumor burden in brain
cancer and prolong patient survival. The therapeutic cargos are encapsulated cytotoxic
drugs for otherwise intractable brain tumors. After exiting the brain vasculature, upon
recognition by the tumor cell, the nanoparticle binds, gets taken into the cell
(endocytosed) and the nanoparticle cargo is released, ultimately allowing availability of
the drug to kill the cancer cell. This project fits well within the mission of the NCI, to
develop new nanotechnology-based therapeutics, especially for high-risk tumors.
Historically successful cancer chemotherapy, while vastly increasing survival in non-
CNS tumors, has failed to do so for brain tumors in children and adults alike. GBM
remains the most malignant primary central nervous system tumor, where the median
overall survival is 15–23 months and 5-year survival is less than 6%. The incidence of
brain metastases is increasing with an estimated 69,950 adults age 40+ in 2021 in the
US alone. Brain tumors represent the highest per-patient initial cost of care for any
cancer group. Estimations from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) on
annualized mean net cost of care approach $150,000 per patient. These patients have
the highest annualized mean net costs for last-year-of-life care, relative to other cancers,
at $135,000 to $210,000 (depending on age and gender). There us thus dramatic unmet
need to prevent morbidity and mortality while improving an otherwise dismal survival rate.
Treatment-resistant metastases are the ultimate cause of death in most cancer patients.
For brain cancer treatment, systemic therapy for metastases is generally ineffective due
to the inability to get therapeutic doses across the blood brain barrier. A reliable, low-
toxic, highly effective therapy is urgently needed to treat patients with primary tumors
and treatment-resistant metastases. The specific aims of this proposal are therefore
efficient encapsulation cancer drugs inside the targeted HPLNs that cross the blood
brain barrier, demonstrate safety and efficacy in killing cancer cells in a spectrum of
humanized xenograft mouse models of human GBM. NanoValent's goal, at the
conclusion of the Fast Track proposal is to have a promising optimized formulation that
can be that can ultimately be GMP manufactured and submitted for IND approval with
the FDA."

robust plan to attract underrepresented minorities and enhance diversity of this training program."
10912613,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The incidence and mortality of endometrial cancer has increased over the past few decades, and is predicted to
continue rising. There is significant need for improved therapies with reduced toxicity for women with endometrial
cancers that are advanced, recurrent or refractory to standard of care. Endometrial cancer is a heterogeneous
disease that has been classified into molecular profile categories with different degrees of patient prognosis.
Across these categories, endometrial cancer has the highest rates of mutations in heat shock protein A(HSPA)
5, 8 and 9 genes compared to other The Cancer Genome Atlas-studied cancers. The HSPA5, HSPA8 and
HSPA9 genes encode chaperone proteins, Grp78, hsc70 and mortalin, respectively, which become elevated
during carcinogenesis to bind and modulate oncoproteins in a way that assures cancer cell survival. Thus, these
chaperone/oncoprotein complexes represent differential targets present at higher levels in cancer cells
compared to healthy cells. We developed a drug, SHetA2 (NSC 726189), which disrupts these complexes.
SHetA2 induces growth arrest, altered metabolism, mitophagy and cell death in endometrial cancer cells, while
the effects on healthy cells is limited to G1 cell cycle arrest. Preclinical studies found lack of SHetA2 toxicity, and
this drug is now in a Phase 1 clinical trial in advanced, recurrent or persistent gynecologic cancers
(NCT04928508). In vivo studies revealed that SHetA2 has complementary activities and efficacies with paclitaxel
and cyclin dependent kinase (CDK4/6) inhibitors. In this project, we hypothesize that SHetA2 will safely reduce
endometrial cancer tumor burden and complement the efficacies of paclitaxel and CDK4/6 inhibitors without
increasing toxicity; the mechanism will be mediated through SHetA2 disruption of HSPA/client protein
complexes; and the treatment efficacies will be modulated by mutations in PTEN and TP53 genes. To test this,
and optimize SHetA2-based therapies, we propose to study the mechanism of SHetA2 in healthy endometrial
cells, endometrial cancer cell lines, and patient derived organoids and xenografts with a range of natural or
induced genetic mutations in PTEN and TP53 genes. We will conduct a Phase 1 clinical trial of SHetA2 in
combination with paclitaxel in advanced, recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer patients; a Phase 2
expansion will evaluate response. Using specimens from this and other trials, we will test the hypothesis that
mortalin co-localization with the Mps1 kinase or p53 at the centrosome correlates with poor or improved
response, respectively, of paclitaxel-treated endometrial cancer patients. In preparation for a future clinical trial,
we will use a quantitative systems biology approach that integrates pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and
toxicity data to optimize dose and schedule for testing SHetA2 in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors. The
outcome is anticipated to identify biomarkers predictive of which patients will most likely benefit from SHetA2-
based therapies, and provide justification and data for development of a randomized Phase 3 trial of a SHetA2
combination anticipated to have an improved therapeutic window over current therapy."
10898882,"SUMMARY – CORE C
The Statistics and Networks Methods Core (Core C) of this PPG will actively collaborate with each of the
projects by helping them use statistical, network, and computational methods in their research; by advancing
statistical and network methods to expand the scope of their accomplishments; and by helping them solve any
unexpected problems that arise. Core C staff will collaborate with Project Leads on study designs, and will
supervise Core B programmers to overcome challenges and implement methods that Core C develops inside
the secure computing environment at The Dartmouth Institute, so that these can be used to analyze the patient
identifiable data relevant to each project. Motivated by the recent surge of interest in health and health care for
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), a growing concern for health disparities and their
exacerbation by algorithmic bias, and advances in statistical methods and network analysis, Core C will
advance methods that will make all four projects more effective and impactful. Core C will focus on: (1)
statistical models for complex data structures that expand understanding of disparities and intersectional
disparities, (2) development of networks that better capture the structure of relationships linking physicians of
multiple specialties through the interdependencies in their medical practice, and (3) construction of novel
quality of care measures and models of network data. These methods will be applied to patients with claims-
based diagnoses of ADRD or who are at risk for developing ADRD. A common new theme in this renewal PPG
is the use of comparative-effectiveness research, as it overcomes bias and enhances statistical power to
quantify disparities and variations by modeling hierarchically structured and other forms of dependent data and
by forming inferences that are causally-defendable. Core C key personnel have made substantial progress in
establishing methods that use directional relationship information from patient-physician encounters in
Medicare claims to form innovative physician networks with directed edges. They will enhance this work by
using specialty and services-performed data to establish even more informative networks and network-based
measures of access to care and other important aspects of health care. Statistical models will also be devised
that use these networks to explain additional variation in outcomes and disparities, while longitudinal models of
the network itself will provide insights into trends in and the dynamic association of factors affecting ADRD
diagnosis and care. These innovations will allow the PPG-supported projects to delve deeper than would be
possible otherwise. Results and products (e.g., software) will be widely disseminated to research and
stakeholder communities. Core C will have a major supportive and innovative impact on the research of the
four projects and on the wider research communities working in ADRD, health disparities, and variations in
care with a goal of improving the U.S. health system."
10898895,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 4
For the 5.8 million Americans diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD), acute
illnesses such as pulmonary embolism (PE) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) present unique challenges
for both diagnosis and treatment. Patients with ADRD bear a disproportionate burden of acute disease, with
higher disease risk and lower rates of testing and treatment. At each step of the care pathway, testing and
treatment decisions for patients with ADRD are complicated by differences in clinical presentation,
communication, and uncertainty about potential recovery from high-intensity care. If patients with ADRD have
more difficulty communicating their history and symptoms, or if they present with different sets of symptoms
and risk factors, clinicians may have greater difficulty discerning patient risk. Concern about patient recovery
from high-intensity care, provider biases, and patients’ differing goals of care may also contribute to low rates
of testing and treatment. In this project we will investigate how a claims-based diagnosis of ADRD affects the
rate and targeting of diagnostic tests, as well as the benefits and risks of more intensive testing and treatment.
Aim 1: Investigate how testing decisions for PE and AMI depend on the presence of diagnosed ADRD and
severity of cognitive impairment. Aim 2: Develop and validate a hospital-level measure of PE and AMI testing
intensity and diagnostic processes for patients with and without ADRD. Aim 3: Using instrumental variables,
test whether hospitals with more intensive testing for PE and AMI among high-risk patients with ADRD achieve
better or worse health outcomes for these patients. In addition to collaborating with Core B and C, we will work
with Project 1 to contextualize how access to home and community-based services affect nursing home use
and recovery from acute illness. In partnership with Project 3, we will test how regional primary care quality
predicts care utilization and health outcomes after PE or AMI. In this study, we will examine how more or less
aggressive testing and treatment strategies are associated with patient outcomes, including nursing home use,
mortality, delayed diagnosis and adverse health events. These results will inform shared decision-making by
providers, patients and caregivers, illuminating the clinical tradeoffs of intensive testing and treatment for PE
and AMI."

The major theme of the Seattle Wellstone center is to improve therapeutic approaches to muscular
dystrophies by identifying and overcoming the emerging new barriers to successful clinical trials in muscular
dystrophies. The specific aims and objectives are to breach the major barriers to successful therapeutic
clinical trials in muscular dystrophies in the Northwest and nationwide. Aim 1 (Project 1) will conduct
translational and pre-clinical studies of muscular dystrophy gene therapy. Studies in this Aim will (a) identify
optimized AAV variants for skeletal and cardiac muscle, modify micro-dystrophin sequences to diminish
immunogenicity and increase function, and test split intein vector strategies for delivering more potent
dystrophin constructs to skeletal and cardiac muscle; (b) will apply parallel AAV-mediated methods to achieve
the suppression of human DUX4 in a mouse model of FSHD and in a large animal porcine model of FSHD,
extending the use of similar vector technologies as a general delivery platform for dominant muscular
dystrophies and opening new therapeutic opportunities for FSHD. Aim 2 (Project 2) will establish
facioscapulohumeral dystrophy clinical trial foundations. Studies in this aim will (a) perform clinical and MRI
assessment in a long-term extension of the prior Seattle Wellstone FSHD cohorts and apply newer methods
of MRI data analysis to generate a multi-year composite dataset of FSHD disease progression for correlations
with disease progression; (b) perform a dose-escalation safety and tolerability study of a therapeutic candidate
that will incorporate the most current MRI and molecular characteristics to assess their performance for the
design of future clinical trials; and (c) perform functional, MRI, and molecular characterization of a new porcine
model of FSHD to determine its utility as a preclinical model for human studies. Aim 3 (Cores A, B, C) will
administer, provide resources for scientific research, and train future muscular dystrophy scientific and clinical
researchers. The Center cores (Administrative, Scientific Research, and Training) will provide support and
oversight of all activities, provide necessary biological resources to achieve the goals of the Center and serve
as a national resource, provide training of the next generation of scientific and clinical researchers in muscular
dystrophy and conduct outreach and educational activities. Together, these aims will achieve the overall goal
to develop the reagents, measurements, clinical trials methods, and clinical trials infrastructures to speed the
development of effective therapies for DMD and FSHD, and to bring muscular dystrophy clinical trials and
therapies to the families of the Northwest and beyond."
10702064,"Project Summary
Sleep is thought to play a significant contribution in the consolidation of multiple forms of memories during
development. Transient disruptions of sleep often lead to delays and losses in learned skilled behaviors. While
research has made great progress in understanding the role of sleep in the hippocampal dependent learning of
explicit memories, how sleep influences the synaptic circuits involved in learning perceptual and procedural
memories is still poorly understood. Songbirds provide an unmatched opportunity to study sleep based
consolidation of skilled motor behaviors. Juvenile songbirds learn their courtship song through extensive daily
practice, producing tens of thousands of renditions by adulthood. Daily, auditory-feedback guided improvements
in song are hypothesized to be consolidated nightly during sleep, enabling renewed vocal exploration and
continued refinement of song performances through development. My predoctoral research seeks to identify the
synaptic circuits involved in sleep-based consolidation of song and the long-term impact of transient disruptions
in these circuits during song development. By combining in vivo pharmacological manipulations with machine
learning-based approaches for segregating and analyzing changes in singing behavior, I have identified at least
one nuclei governing the sleep-based consolidation of complex motor behaviors. Remaining work to be done
during the F99 phase will focus on the specific contributions of individual premotor synaptic circuits using
synapse-specific pharmacology in conjunction with pathway specific chemogenetics. Also during the F99 phase,
I will follow up on unexpected findings to determine the evolutionary relevance of song diversity in mate choice.
The K00 phase of this proposal will provide a specific plan to find an ideal mentor and research environment for
enhancing my knowledge and technical skills of neuroinvasion and propagation of viruses leading to generation
of novel viral vectors for the effective dissection of neural circuits. Together, the research and training detailed
in the two phases of this proposal will allow me to achieve my long-term goal of engineering sophisticated tools
to understand the molecular, cellular, and synaptic basis of learned complex motor behaviors as a tenured

 Super-enhancers (SEs) are expansive regions of genomic DNA comprised of multiple putative enhancers
that contribute to dynamic gene expression patterns during development. This is particularly important in
neurogenesis because many essential transcription factors have complex developmental stage– and cell–type
specific expression patterns across the central nervous system. In the developing retina, Vsx2 is expressed in
all retinal progenitor cells and is maintained in differentiated bipolar neurons and Müller glia. Mutations in the
Vsx2 gene cause microphthalmia in humans and mice because it is required for retinal progenitor cell
proliferation. Due to this severe early developmental phenotype, it has been difficult to elucidate the role of Vsx2
in bipolar neuron and Müller glia differentiation.
 Victoria Honnell has found that a single SE controls this complex and dynamic pattern of expression in
mice. The deletion of one region disrupts retinal progenitor cell proliferation in early retinal development. The
deletion of another region has no effect on retinal progenitor cell proliferation but instead leads to a complete
loss of bipolar neurons. This prototypical SE may serve as a model for dissecting the complex gene expression
patterns for neurogenic transcription factors during development. Moreover, it provides a unique opportunity to
alter expression of individual transcription factors in distinct cell types at specific stages of development. This
provides a deeper understanding of function that cannot be achieved with traditional gene knockout mouse
approaches.
 In the F99-phase of this proposed research, Victoria will examine the modularity of the Vsx2 SE in human
retinal organoid models. This will inform the field’s understanding of how distinct enhancer regions affect retinal
cell-type specification in a model of human development. In the K00-phase of this proposed research, Victoria
will examine the modularity of other SEs controlling gene expression in the brain. She will characterize the
looping interactions and epigenetic landscape of these SE regions to understand how they influence gene
expression at multiple stages across brain development, and how aberrations in these mechanisms contribute
to neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative disease.
 This proposed work will yield an innovative approach to uncouple the early and late stage effects of genes
with complex expression patterns and provide an understanding of how the epigenetic landscape of enhancers
affect the expression of neurogenic transcription factors. Ultimately, this will inform the field’s understanding of
enhanceropathies that contribute to disorders and diseases of the central nervous system."
10702157,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
While combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has significantly extended the lifespan of people with HIV
(PWH), nearly half of all PWH are estimated to have HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Even
mild forms of HAND, which are more prevalent in the cART era, significantly reduce quality of life for PWH and
can result in unemployment, lack of adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and increased mortality. With a rapidly
aging population, there is increased demand for improved understanding of the neural mechanisms of HAND –
especially prior to the onset of clinical symptoms – as older PWH are at an increased risk of developing HAND.
While dysfunction within the frontostriatal circuits has been implicated in HAND, the profile of disruption within
these circuits remains elusive. The goal of this work is to determine whether functional and structural
frontostriatal abnormalities present in older, virally suppressed PWH with minimal cognitive impairment.
Utilizing structural and functional MRI techniques, this proposal will address the following specific aims. My
dissertation research thus far (Aim 1) indicates that older, virally suppressed PWH with minimal cognitive
impairment have reduced frontostriatal functional connectivity compared to controls. In addition, increased HIV
disease severity and decreased neurocognitive function were associated with cortical thinning in PWH,
especially in the prefrontal cortex. In the next phase of my dissertation (F99, Aim 2), I will test the hypotheses
that frontostriatal white matter connections are compromised in older PWH compared to controls and that the
relationship between HIV disease severity and executive function is mediated by frontostriatal white matter
integrity. Results from these studies will provide critical insights into the neural mechanisms of HAND, inform
the development of early diagnostic methods, and help identify potential therapeutic targets. Upon completion
of my dissertation, I plan to complete a postdoctoral fellowship (K00, Aim 3) studying how comorbid conditions
(e.g. depression) in people with HIV contribute to HAND development and progression."

 Lead: Karl Deisseroth MD PhD
Summary
This project is focused on development and application of technology for probing the interaction of external
sensory input with internal states of the mammalian brain. The unique leverage of our team is technology-driven
experimental access to new regimes of speed, scope, and resolution in defining and tuning these internal states.
First, we will quantify the population dynamics and statistical structure of time-varying spontaneous activity
across the volume of primary visual cortex (with individual cells defined by position and wiring in 3D space, and
by molecular identity) to test impact of spontaneous fluctuations on environmental stimulus-triggered neuronal
activity and animal behavior. Next, we will quantify cortical activity during transitions among internal states
(along with behaviors), impose precisely-defined ensemble activity to assess impact of state transitions on
evoked population dynamics and behavior, and quantify endogenous activity influencing these states to assess
natural mechanisms and effects. Finally, we will integrate our biological findings and new technological
capabilities to directly and precisely impose more complex temporal dynamics of interest by controlling multiple
single cells in multiple cortical regions over time. The same cells observed to be active and important in behavior
will be made available for molecular phenotyping analysis, so that cell typology may be linked to the specific
natural and causal roles of cells in this important domain of circuit computation and behavior."

The overarching goal of RP2 is to understand how neural circuits in primate primary visual cortex (V1) interact
with other brain regions to give rise to behavioral performance in demanding visual discrimination tasks. We
will develop and use an unprecedented array of experimental tools for simultaneously reading and writing
neural population responses at multiple spatial scales in behaving macaque cortex. Our end goal is to develop
and test quantitative and mechanistic computational models that can account for (1) the encoding of external
inputs (visual or optogenetic) by dynamic V1 population responses, (2) the decoding of V1 responses to external
stimuli by neural populations in key downstream decision/motor areas that mediate behavior, and (3) the
interplay between spontaneous variations in V1 activity that are related to fluctuating internal states and their
impact on stimulus encoding and decoding. Together, our experimental and computational work will provide
novel insights into the mechanisms that mediate complex, naturalistic, perceptually guided behaviors in the

10911113,"Research Project 4 – Internal state dynamics of navigation and memory
 Lead: Lisa Giocomo PhD
 Project Summary
In RP4 (Navigation and memory) we leverage the navigation system to experimentally investigate
theoretical and computational principles for how external sensory inputs and internal network dynamics, across
different brain states, interact to generate the neural computations necessary for navigation. We focus on four
brain regions that provide complementary computations for visually guided navigation in mice: primary visual
cortex (V1), medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), hippocampus (HPC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC). In our first
aim, we consider how internal dynamics interact with external sensory inputs to generate a unified percept of
position. We leverage virtual reality and the high density recording capabilities of Neuropixel silicon probes to
explicitly test predictions of a Bayesian cue integration framework developed in RP3 (Theory and
computation of internal state dynamics). Here, internal dynamics reflect intrinsic path integration
calculations, while external inputs include visual landmark and optic flow inputs. In our second aim, we consider
how a change in behavioral state impacts the stability of neural maps of space and test theoretical principles,
developed in RP3 and applied to V1 in RP1 (Motivation and perception) and RP2 (Primate decision
making), for how spontaneous activity influences the detection or amplification of weak sensory inputs in the
navigation circuit. As in Aim 1, we leverage virtual reality and the high density recording capabilities of
Neuropixel silicon probes. Here, we consider a change in spontaneous activity as analogous to a change in
internal behavioral state (satiety or arousal) and consider how this impacts the stability of internal position
estimates, as measured by the spatial firing patterns of neurons, across environments with parametrically
differing external landmark strength (cue rich or cue poor conditions). In our third aim, we consider whether
driving the activity of single neurons can establish causality between neural representations in RSC and visually-
guided navigation. By applying a MultiSLM 2-photon Ca2+ imaging method developed in RP1, which enables
wide-field optical access for visualization and control of cellular ensembles in real time, we will test theories
developed in RP2 regarding attractor states and whether critically excitable regimes capable of driving behavior,
which have been observed in V1, exist in non-sensory cortical regions. Here, external input is manipulated with
single-cell resolution optogenetically, and intrinsic network dynamics for encoding internal position estimates
measured using 2P Ca2+ imaging. Together, across all of our aims, our approach of investigating multiple
navigationally relevant brain regions alongside V1 will allow us to rigorously consider the degree to which
foundational theories for classes of neural computation – developed in RP3 – follow universal principles across
cortical regions or show divergence based on how disparate brain circuits weight internal dynamics versus
external inputs."

10817211,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 More than 38 million people are living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection worldwide
which continues to be a global public health problem. Despite the widespread use of efficacious combination of
antiretroviral therapy (cART), up to 70% of HIV-positive individuals suffer from cognitive and behavioral deficits
collectively known as HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Although acute viral replication has
been well controlled with cART in the early stage of HIV infection, long-term HIV-1 viral protein exposure within
the CNS causes dopaminergic deficits and neurocognitive impairments despite the advent of cART. Substance
abuse such as methamphetamine (METH) have been shown to increase the incidence of HAND and
exacerbate its severity. Among the viral proteins, HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein plays a
significant role in viral replication in the early stage of HIV infection and the pathophysiological effects on
development of HAND. Dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) transports the extracellular dopamine (DA) into
cytosolic space of the synaptic terminals, whereas the vesicular monoamine transporter2 (VMAT2) transports
the cytosolic DA into synaptic vesicles, whereby both DA transporter and VMAT2 are critical for normal DA
homeostasis. Our published studies have demonstrated that Tat protein increases extracellular DA
concentration by directly inhibiting DAT, however, the cellular mechanisms underlying Tat-induced inhibition of
VMAT2-mediated DA release/uptake remains unexplored. We hypothesize that HIV-1 Tat, acting via the
unique binding sites, perturbs the VMAT2 regulatory network that normally sustains concentrative DA transport
and potentiates METH’s effect on VMAT2 function, resulting in DA-linked neuropsychiatric dysfunction
prominently featured in HAND. Studying single Tat protein allow us to identify targets for Tat binding and
develop therapeutic approaches to prevent Tat-mediated neurological damages. The purpose of the proposed
investigation is to understand the molecular mechanisms of dysregulation of VMAT2-mediated DA
transmission induced by HIV-1 Tat and METH and explore the potential of novel compounds for the prevention
of HAND. The specific aims to be pursued in the proposed investigation are: (1) through computational
modeling and experimental validation, identify the recognition binding pockets on human VMAT2 for Tat,
METH, or novel VMAT2 inhibitors and explore the potential interactions of the inhibitors with Tat and METH,
(2) accelerate the pathophysiological roles of VMAT2 in Tat- and METH-dysregulated DA system, and (3)
perform proof-of-concept studies using pharmacological and genetic approaches as biological probes to
establish their potential for therapeutic application in HAND in concurrent METH users."

Although the ubiquity of metabolic problems in pulmonary hypertension (PH) has been known for more than a
decade, a wealth of new details on the nature of this problem presents the opportunity for intervention. A
combination of experimental work in cells and animals and early trials in humans, suggests that these
metabolic problems are part of the causation for PH, and that inactivation of the mitochondrial lysine
deacetylase SIRT3 is a central node in regulating the metabolic defects. A vicious cycle exists in which a
triggering event or mutation increases reactive oxygen species (ROS), which produces reactive lipids, which
adduct and inactivate SIRT3, causing metabolic changes that result in further increased ROS. Here, we break
this cycle using 2-HOBA, a small molecule which can effectively soak up reactive lipids in vivo and our
preliminary studies show that 2-HOBA is a safe compound and in IND enabling animal toxicity and human
safety trials and shows great promise in treating the core molecular defects in PH. Our preliminary data and
Phase I studies demonstrate not only clear positive impact on reducing pulmonary vascular resistances in
Group I and II PH, and both cytokine and molecular biomarkers of disease, but also indicated the potential for
a substantial positive effect on heart function under load stress. In this Phase II project, we will establish the
remaining data needed to proceed to commercialization through the following aims: 1) we will test the safety
and molecular efficiency of 2-HOBA in PH patients in a small open label mechanistic pilot trial with of two
weeks of 2-HOBA exposure; 2) we will demonstrate efficacy of 2HOBA in improving function of the right
ventricle under stress in a well-established sheep model; and 3) we will test effectiveness of 2-HOBA alone
and in the context of standard-of-care in mouse models and large animals. 2-HOBA is an entirely new
approach to solving a molecular problem that several existing clinical trials and case reports have tried to
resolve, but so far with limited success. The specific mechanism of action of 2-HOBA should allow it to
succeed where other interventions have failed."

This Phase II project describes the commercial development of HyperAxon™, highly innovative software for
performing automated segmentation, tracing, reconstruction and quantitative analysis of all axonal fibers (with
and without signs of acute axonal injury) visible in two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) microscopy images
of central nervous system (CNS) areas, even those with extremely high axonal fiber density. Accurate and
rigorous analysis of all axonal fibers visible in 3D and 2D microscopy images of CNS tissue of non-transgenic
and transgenic animal models as well as in human post mortem CNS tissue promises to enable researchers to
gain novel insights into physiological neural network connectivity patterns as well as into the neuropathological
underpinnings of alterations in connectivity associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders.
However, this cannot be achieved with contemporary, computer-assisted tracing and reconstruction methods,
which currently are the gold standard for investigating axonal fibers, because these methods primarily address
tracing and reconstruction of only a limited number of individual axonal fibers. During Phase I we created
HyperAxon prototype software by leveraging the original, lab-built technology Learning-based Tracing of Dense
Axonal Fibers created at MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MIT LL) (Lexington, MA) and extending this technology with
several new, specialized deep neural networks. Furthermore, we validated that our approach will be successful
in research applications. All specific aims of Phase I were fully completed, demonstrating feasibility of
successfully developing HyperAxon. The game-changing innovation in HyperAxon is the ability to automatically
(i) segment, trace and reconstruct all axonal fibers visible in 3D and 2D microscopy images of CNS areas with
high axonal fiber density, (ii) identify axonal branch points, (iii) resolve axonal fibers of passage in fiber tracts
from those in axonal terminal fields, (iv) identify axonal fibers showing acute axonal injury and (v) precisely
quantify alterations in number and density of axonal fibers in CNS tissue. For widespread dissemination of this
important new technology we plan to commercialize the HyperAxon software at the end of Phase II as both a
cloud-based “software as a service” running on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and traditional software
application running on local institutional computers. We are convinced that HyperAxon will be impactful in the
field of neuroscience research and will enable substantial advancements in research on alterations in CNS
circuitry associated with neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, neurodegenerative and neurological disorders.
Ultimately, this will result in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for a wide spectrum of
complex brain diseases. In Phase I we demonstrated feasibility of this novel technology by developing prototype
software; work in Phase II will focus on creating the full functionality of HyperAxon for commercial release. During
Phase II we will perform extensive product validation and usability studies of HyperAxon in close collaboration
with MIT LL and our academic collaboration partners. A competing technology is not available."

Sixteen million Americans are diagnosed with dry eye disease, with likely many more suffering from this issue.
Prevalence is higher among women, increases with age, and is now also notable among those aged 18–34
years. It is characterized by a loss of homeostasis of the tear film and may be accompanied by persistent
symptoms of irritation or burning that can cause inflammatory damage to the cornea and conjunctiva if untreated.
Current eye-drop treatments that work by reducing the inflammation on the ocular service have several
deficiencies that can be frustrating for patients. The immunomodulator, cyclosporine, is commonly prescribed in
these eye drops using a variety of delivery vehicles including anionic emulsions, cationic nanoemulsions, or
nanomicellar solutions. However, the impact of the vehicle to prolong corneal residence is still limited due to
natural ocular defensive mechanisms. This is believed to be one reason that the common dry eye disease
treatment by such eye drops do not have better or faster efficacy in clinical trials. In this Phase II project, we
propose continuing the successful development of a drug delivery contact lens (DDCL) designed to manage dry
eye by incorporating cyclosporine A (CsA) to better deliver the active ingredient with fewer side effects due to
better control of dosing. An important discovery in Phase I was the use of hyaluronic acid (HA) improving CsA
uptake and retention, with the potential for faster relief of symptoms due to HA's own lubricating and regenerative
properties as a naturally occurring substance in the body. With the key aims of Phase I substantially completed,
Phase II will focus on optimizing the DDCL with CsA and HA using active ingredients sourced from commercial
manufacturers, and lenses with FDA 510(k) clearance for which we have rights to commercial use. The product
can then be easily integrated into an existing contact lens production process for use in clinical trials following
the project. Successful completion of the Phase II research strategy will include positive results by in vivo study
and an IND application for clinical study of the DDCL in a human population. For the commercialization strategy,
we have agreement with a global contact lens company to manufacture and supply the DDCL, and are
negotiating a licensing agreement with this partner for selected regions. Investment and future royalties from the
partner will allow our independent development of the DDCL for other markets in the future."

This proposed project aims to develop a new type of digital PCR platform which eliminates the
need for uniform volumes and thereby reduces the complexity, cost, and run time of digital PCR
while increasing its dynamic range. The result is a higher performance digital PCR system that
matches the simplicity, speed, and low per-assay cost of real-time PCR.
Real-time PCR maintains great popularity in clinical diagnostics, but digital PCR is superior to
real-time PCR because it provides absolute quantitation, greater accuracy at low concentrations,
and greater reproducibility. However, because it was hypothesized that uniform volumes are
required for digital PCR quantitation, current digital PCR platforms require precise microfluidic
chips and control, which result in low throughput and high per-assay costs. Here we propose to
address these limitations by developing a digital PCR system that employs variable volume
droplets created simply by shaking a sample along with PCR reagents and an oil/emulsifier mix
to create an emulsion. PCR is performed, and droplets in the emulsion are imaged and sized.
Droplets with one or more copies of a nucleic acid are identified, and nucleic acid concentration
is determined. We call this edPCR (emulsion digital PCR).
We characterized this edCPR method via computational simulations and validated it
experimentally. Simulations were used to investigate the dependence of droplet occupancy on
analyte concentration and droplet size distribution, and to estimate the accuracy of the
measured concentration in the presence of errors in measurement of droplet volume.
Simulations also provided an estimate of dynamic range for a given droplet size distribution and
statistical power. The method was validated experimentally in terms of accuracy, precision, and
dynamic range, and to rule out potential sources of biased error, such as droplet shrinking and
droplet fusion during PCR.
In the proposed work, we will develop a commercial edPCR platform that will offer the superior
performance of digital PCR while providing the high-throughput (e.g. 384 well plate operation)
and low per-assay cost of real-time PCR, which we believe will remove the barriers to the
widespread use of digital PCR in clinical assays, point-of-care settings, and large-scale testing."

Racial/ethnic minority and low-income women are most vulnerable to poor oral health during pregnancy.
These vulnerable women are less likely than White and higher-income women to utilize dental care during
pregnancy. However, pregnancy is often the only time when these women can access dental care through the
Medicaid program. National evidence-based guidelines advocate for dental care during pregnancy to improve
oral health. However, prenatal oral health programs designed to increase dental utilization among vulnerable
pregnant women have had disappointing results. The major obstacle to identifying upstream barriers to
downstream dental care utilization during pregnancy is the lack of longitudinal data on factors that predict
dental care utilization and oral health in vulnerable women. This study is informed by the Theory of
Constrained Choice (Bird & Rieker, 1999), which posits that women’s opportunities to create a healthy lifestyle
are constrained due to social and gender-related processes that interact with biological processes (e.g.,
pregnancy). This study will leverage an ongoing interprofessional collaboration between the New York
University College of Dentistry and the Bellevue Hospital Obstetrics and Gynecology Service. We will collect
survey data on socio-behavioral and psychosocial factors common in these vulnerable women during the first
trimester of pregnancy. We will conduct clinical oral examinations to evaluate tooth loss, dental caries,
gingivitis and periodontitis and will refer all women for dental care. We will re-survey and re-examine these
women during the third trimester of pregnancy and will use Medicaid claims to evaluate dental care utilization.
We will use cross-sectional and longitudinal structural equation modeling to identify socio-behavioral and
psychosocial predictors of dental care utilization and oral health during pregnancy. This project explicitly
addresses RFA-OD-19-029’s call to examine sex and gender influences on oral health and oral disease and
expand research on female-specific conditions and diseases, including reproductive stages and maternal and
gynecologic health. This research will elucidate which factors must be addressed when designing interventions
to improve dental care utilization and oral health outcomes among pregnant women at elevated risk for oral
disease. This study is the first step in addressing our long-term goal to improve the oral health of vulnerable
women by intervening during pregnancy."

The New Mexico Occupational Health Surveillance Program (NMOHSP) has been in existence
for over 17 years. The program collects, compiles and analyzes data from many sources and
uses them to identify and address areas of concern for worker safety and health. NMOHSP was
instrumental in the addition of occupational illnesses and injury to the list of notifiable conditions
in the state of New Mexico. NMOHSP collects, generates and interprets 24 Occupational Health
Indicators, receives and analyzes workers' compensation and hospital discharge data, and has
ensured that industry and occupation questions are a part of the state's Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System every year. NMOHSP staff carry out in-depth case investigations for
occupational exposure to toxins reported to New Mexico Poison and Drug Information Center,
elevated blood lead levels in adults, and deaths or injuries in the workplace reported in the
media. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, NMOHSP has aided the Infectious
Disease Epidemiology Bureau (IDEB) with the collection and analysis of occupational data on
COVID-19 cases, and the New Mexico Occupational Health and Safety Administration (NM
OSHA) in identifying workplaces with multiple COVID-19 cases to allow for quick intervention. In
the current Fundamental Plus application, NMOHSP proposes to continue fundamental
activities with a specific focus on standardizing protocols and providing clear documentation and
planning that will allow the program to increase capacity and effectiveness. NMOHSP has a
growing role and impact and meeting full potential can best be achieved with careful planning,
organization and evaluation. In addition, NMOHSP will analyze the COVID-19 case data on
occupational and industry and use the findings to release a public report, including a priority list
of industries and occupations who appear to be at elevated risk. In close partnership with NM
OSHA, this report will be used to develop industry/occupation specific guidance on prevention of
respiratory infectious disease spread in the workplace. This guidance is greatly needed, not only
for current COVID-19 efforts, but for future pandemics, and even to decrease the impact of
seasonal influenza. Lastly, NMOHSP will work with the New Mexico Department of Health's
Office of the Tribal Liaison on a comprehensive long-term plan for effective communication and
partnership with the state's indigenous sovereign nations."

One in five women and one in fourteen men in the US have been raped, with four out of five rape survivors

violence and alcohol use with cutting edge social network and social norms research is critical for advances in
prevention efforts. This Mentored Research Scientist Development K01 Award is designed to increase the
candidate’s capacities to undertake innovative social network analyses to provide important insights into the
gender socialization processes that occur in adolescence and contribute to alcohol use and sexual violence
behavior across the lifecourse. The proposed activities will take place alongside a strong and dedicated training
committee comprised of globally renowned experts and will extend the candidate’s existing expertise in social
epidemiology to include: social and developmental psychology, adolescent alcohol epidemiology, longitudinal
social network analysis, and multilevel structural equation modeling. Research activities will involve social
network and structural equation modeling techniques using secondary data from a nationally-representative
prospective cohort study. Three specific aims are proposed: Aim 1) Longitudinally examine the relationship
between individual gender expression, alcohol use, and sexual violence; Aim 2) Assess contribution of normative
gender expression within peer groups to variation in alcohol use and sexual violence outcomes; Aim 3) Identify
latent classes of adolescents at greatest risk for alcohol use and sexual violence, and the social network
processes (selection and influence) that moderate risk. Research significance includes: a) identification of novel
and developmentally-specific mechanisms that explain sex-disparities in alcohol use and sexual violence in
adolescence; b) identification of typologies of adolescent peer groups at highest risk for both alcohol use and
sexual violence. These findings will provide new avenues for prevention efforts to address the developmental
origins of sex-disparities in alcohol use and sexual violence. Research innovations include: a) social network
algorithms to identify peer groups, used within multilevel models; b) a novel, validated measure of gender
expression; c) an integrated multilevel lifecourse framework of adolescent socialization processes linked to
alcohol use and sexual violence. Findings from this work will inform a future survey-based R01 among younger
adolescents to further elucidate the social psychological processes and normative environments in adolescent
peer groups that impact alcohol use and sexual violence, as modified by racial, sexual, and gender minority
status. This work responds to the NIAAA Division of Epidemiology and Prevention Research’s (DEPR) Strategic
Plan, which underscores the need for research focused on prevention and youth."
10909403,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This T35 competitive renewal application requests continued funding for the Case Medical Student Summer
Research Program (MSSRP). The overall goal of the program is to promote career development for physician
scientists who will choose biomedical investigation as an essential component of their long-term professional
development, with particular focus on the mission areas of the NIDDK and NIDDK-related research. These
include: 1) Digestive Diseases, 2) Liver Diseases, 3) Diabetes & Metabolic Diseases, 4) Kidney Diseases, 5)
GI Tumorigenesis, and 6) Inflammation/Infection. The program educates medical students using a mentor-
based research approach over an 8-week training period between their 1st and 2nd years of medical school.
The T35 program is based on strategic planning, consolidated efforts, and close academic integration of the
CWRU School of Medicine (SoM), University Hospitals (UH) Cleveland Medical Center, the Cleveland Clinic,
MetroHealth, and the Louis Stokes VA Medical Center, which provides a superb programmatic infrastructure.
The faculty mentors from these institutions sustain a reputation of excellence based on superior clinical and
basic research, ample funding from the NIDDK and NIDDK-related institutes ($39.8M annual direct costs from
NIH; $15.1M from NIDDK alone), and combined research space in excess of 100,000 ft2. The Case MSSRP
has an established track-record of selecting highly-qualified medical students through a formal application and
evaluation process that identifies a research project and mentor from investigators working in a research area
related to the NIDDK mission. Program evaluation and student progress is overseen by the T35 Executive and
Internal Advisory Committees. Students submit a written abstract and present their findings during the Lepow
Medical Student Research Day held in September. A unique aspect of the program is the multiple PI/PD
approach, which allows research to span departmental boundaries and enlist preceptors with a tradition of
highly-productive collaboration and who have trained a large number of young investigators in an
interdisciplinary manner. The 50 mentors from 19 departments, representing a wide range of research
expertise, offer a multiplicity of research opportunities that are tailored to the scientific interest of each trainee.
Our innovative curriculum includes weekly group meetings, didactic lectures, and a three-day hands-on course
held at the start of the 8-week research period. To assess the long-term impact of the program, we collaborate
with the Medical Education and Alumni Affairs offices to track medical students up to 20 years after graduation.
Based on the high number of applicants during the previous funding period, we are requesting to expand
NIDDK support by an additional 5 students per year (15 total NIDDK-supported trainees). We have strong
institutional support, documented by provision of space and resources, cost-sharing, as well as support from
the CTSC and NIDDK-funded Cleveland DDRCC. Therefore, the academic environment continues to be ideal
to sustain the overall objectives of this NIDDK-focused T35 medical student short-term training program."
10894871,"Project Summary
 The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the human visual system, and how objects
and their locations are perceived and represented in the brain. The proposal investigates a fundamental
challenge for our visual systems: Visual information is coded relative to the eyes, but the eyes are
constantly moving. How, then, do we achieve spatial stability? The world does not appear to “jump” with
each eye movement, but this seamless percept belies a complicated computational process. Moreover,
spatial localization is not an isolated process; it interacts with attention, object recognition, depth perception,
memory, cognitive control, and more. In order to understand visual stability, we need to account for both
how spatial information is represented (or “remapped”) across eye movements, and how spatial information
is integrated with these other processes. Research under the prior award made strong strides in two key
directions along these lines: understanding how 2D spatial information is integrated with depth information
to consider spatial stability in 3D, and revealing how spatial remapping impacts feature/object perception. In
the next stage of this research program, we build on this momentum to investigate spatial and object
stability across eye movements – and their integration more broadly – with a special focus on the roles of
dynamic context and top-down attentional control. In Aim 1 we employ an fMRI-EEG fusion approach to
investigate 3D stability and object integration in visual cortex and the hippocampus, hypothesizing that
dynamic, active saccade context may promote enhanced visual integration and stability. Next, we further
develop the PI’s Dual-Spotlight Theory of remapping (Golomb, 2019) and explore the role of top-down
attentional control in remapping and perceptual stability (Aim 2). Finally, we develop a new model-based
neuroimaging analysis technique to enable future progress on persistently less tractable aspects of this
question (Aim 3). The proposed experiments strive to continue to transform our understanding of visual
stability, particularly how it interfaces with other perceptual and cognitive processes that are central to our
understanding of human perception and brain function. The research proposed here will have an immediate
impact on our understanding of typical visual functioning in healthy human populations. These advances
could also have a longer-term impact on a variety of clinical applications, informing our knowledge and
assessment of visual disorders resulting from eye disease, injury, brain damage, and development/aging."
10915417,"CHD7 (Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding 7) is an ATP-dependent chromatin
remodeling protein that has critical functions in neurogenesis and neural crest cell
development. Pathogenic variants in CHD7 are the most common cause of CHARGE
syndrome or CHD7 disorder, a complex genetic syndrome characterized by ocular
coloboma, heart abnormalities, choanal atresia, retardation of growth, genitourinary
defects, and hearing loss, as well as other developmental defects. Although some
studies have examined the molecular basis for the early ocular defects (such as
coloboma) resulting from CHD7 pathogenic variants, it is not known whether there is a
continuing requirement for CHD7 in the developing retina once ocular morphogenesis is
complete. We have recently shown that CHD7 is robustly expressed in subsets of newly
differentiated retinal cell types, including rod and cone photoreceptors, as well as in
proliferating retinal progenitor cells. Furthermore, zebrafish and mouse Chd7 mutants
display reductions in cone photoreceptor number and abnormally small photoreceptor
outer segments, suggesting a critical role for CHD7 in photoreceptor differentiation and
outer segment morphogenesis. We hypothesize that the chromatin remodeling function
of CHD7 is necessary for the transcriptional activation of genes promoting retinal cell
type differentiation and genes involved in photoreceptor outer segment morphogenesis.
In this proposal, we will test this hypothesis through a combination of zebrafish and
mouse genetics, transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses, and studies of human retinal
organoids and human retinal imaging. Results from these studies will contribute to our
understanding of the genetic and epigenetic regulation of retinal cell type development
as well as the pathogenesis of visual system defects associated with CHD7 disorder."
10924075,"CORE 3: ANIMAL MODELS AND EYE ORGAN CULTURE
ABSTRACT
The goal of the Animal Models and Eye Organ Culture Core is to facilitate the use of animals and eye organ
culture to study visual function and visual diseases by qualifying NEI funded researchers. We also assist non-
qualifying investigators in generating preliminary data, in support of proposals seeking NIH funding. This is
accomplished by providing expertise in complementary animal models across a range of species from rodents
to non-human primates (NHPs) and including spontaneous and experimental models of glaucoma, retinal
degeneration, ocular vascular disease ocular pharmacology and toxicology and infectious diseases and
includes animal handling and anesthesia and, importantly, provision of alternatives to live animal research
including eye organ culture. We provide expertise and equipment necessary for the evaluation of visual
system structure and function including ERG, multifocal and pattern ERG, VEP, OCT, retinal imaging,
tonometry and outflow facility and outflow pathway determination. As a result of unique expertise and access to
model species spanning the translational spectrum, this core has had a broad impact, facilitating
interdisciplinary and inter-institutional vision research in support of the NEI’s mission."
10911379,"Chronic hepatitis B virus infection (CHB) afflicts 1.5-2 million Americans, about 300 million people globally
and causes early death in about 1 million people annually. In the “BeNEG-DO” grant we are studying an
intervention aimed at safely stimulating immune-mediated clinical cures in patients with CHB. While
suppressive standard-of-care nucleos(t)ide analog antiviral therapy (AVT) rarely cures CHB and is usually
taken indefinitely, we are investigating if stopping AVT taken for at least 192 weeks (3.7 yrs), can safely
stimulate a successful immune response to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) when replication reactivates after
AVT is stopped. Clinical cure of CHB occurs when the diagnostic viral protein, the “surface antigen”
(HBsAg), becomes undetectable in blood, which is the principal outcome we are evaluating with the stop-
treatment intervention, while closely monitoring safety. BeNEG-DO was inspired by a seminal proof of
concept study conducted at the University of Athens which stopped AVT in patients with the common “e-antigen
negative” form of CHB (HBeAg-CHB). The Athens study was the first to show that successful HBV immunity
and clinical cures can be generated in substantial numbers of people who stopped AVT after ≥3.7 years of
viral suppression and was achieved without safety concerns. In the currently funded BeNEG-DO grant, we
proposed testing the findings of this Greek study in a much larger San Francisco population that is naturally
enriched for Asians who comprise the world's greatest HBV reservoir. In parallel, we proposed cellular and
molecular studies using baseline liver biopsy and serial blood samples to dissect immunological mechanisms
of HBsAg clearance from blood versus persistence. The translational scientific component was in part
driven by hypotheses based on our mouse model and human data; and it also contained a host genetic
prospecting arm that sought evidence for signature gene expression patterns that both predict outcome
and could point to unsuspected mechanisms of immunity. A key objective of the studies was to distinguish
patients who are most or least likely to benefit from the treatment withdrawal intervention. The 2-center
BeNEG-DO study was fully enrolled; 76 cases stopped AVT, and 30 controls remained on therapy. All cases
have been off therapy for at least 2.5 years through 10/25/20. Already, we have validated that withdrawal
from AVT can lead to unprecedented clinical cure rates and identified groups at previously unknown risk
after stopping AVT. Specifically, 11 patients have already lost HBsAg, 24 more have progressively falling
levels; 11 with latest HBsAg levels <5 IU/mL (range 0.05-3.7). The trajectory of the remaining participants
is still undefined. This renewal application requests funding to continue the objectives outlined in the
original study and to take advantage of latest integrated genomic and proteomic analytical approaches to
determine which HBeAg-CHB patients can safely stop AVT and benefit, and which patients may be at
greatest risk. This study could have major therapeutic, management and financial health care implications."
10919192,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The decrease in the number of physician-scientists correlates with the NIH’s concern regarding the lack
of skilled investigators capable of leading the translation of research discoveries to clinical practice. To
address this national shortage, the Department of Surgery at the University of Miami (UM) Health System
and the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (Sylvester), have re-dedicated the renewal of this T32
training program to producing outstanding academic surgical oncologists—both clinician investigators
and physician scientists. Integration of a two-year research experience into a general surgery residency
or surgical oncology fellowship enhances the likelihood that surgeons will pursue academic careers. The
trainees who have completed the research portion of their training are currently completing their clinical
training, and we anticipate that they will pursue academic careers in fields related to surgical oncology
following completion of their training. Trainees have demonstrated tremendous productivity as evidenced
by publications, national presentations, and awards. The specific objectives of this program are to: 1)
provide training in the conduct of basic, translational, health services, disparities and clinical hypothesis-
driven research, through participation in a two-year, tailored didactic and mentored post-doctoral
research training program experience; 2) integrate surgical oncology research into general surgery
residency and fellowship programs; and 3) develop and expand the pool of surgeon-scientists to become
productive researchers and future leaders in academic surgical oncology. Our program provides
opportunities in a broad range of research training disciplines through two types of research tracks: 1) a
basic and translational science research track in which trainees spend 24 months in the laboratory or 2)
a health disparities and outcomes research track in which trainees spend 24 months under the direction
of one or two of the faculty mentors; this track may include either one year of laboratory-based research
followed by a year of population-based research or two years of population-based research. This
versatility in academic training increases the likelihood of obtaining an academic position upon
completion of training. The mentors in our program include a pool of experienced, extramurally funded
physician- and research-scientists with active research programs in a variety of surgical oncology-related
disciplines including surgery, oncology, population health, health disparities, and biomedical engineering,
who are committed to the highest quality research experience. Our T32 Research Training Program in
Surgical Oncology incorporates an effective assessment processes, a plan to promote diversity by
recruiting and retaining both women and minorities, and a comprehensive plan for training in the
responsible conduct of research in a dynamic, stimulating and collegial learning environment in which
aspiring academic surgical oncologists can receive research training."
10873212,"This proposed R13 application will focus on Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, HIV/AIDS,
Gastroenterology, Cardiology, Pulmonology, Nephrology, and Oncology subspecialty topics. It is titled
NMA 2020 Equipping the Next Generation of Internal Medicine Physicians for Success. The
program will be utilized to enhance the development and training of young investigators who have an
interest in academic medicine and research, with a demonstrated desire to address health disparities.
Due to decreasing numbers in women securing tenured track positions in academia, this year we will
make a concerted effort to focus on providing valuable information to help trainees facilitate the
successful transition from trainee to faculty member. Award recipients will present their posters during the
NMA General Poster Presentation session. This enables our early career investigators to be exposed to
and interact with a broader audience of physicians beyond the internal medicine specialty. Additionally,
the highest scored abstracts will be invited to present their research in the form of a brief oral presentation
within the appropriate subspecialty section during the IM sessions. NMA Internal Medicine (IM)
leaders/senior faculty will be available to network with and participate in small group discussions with
early career investigators.
There are seven objectives to this conference session: (1) Provide a forum for cross-disciplinary
exchange of ideas to further explore issues of health disparities and health equity; (2) Foster opportunities
for early stage minority faculty and trainees to network and learn about current research in the internal
medicine specialty; (3) Promote opportunities for all early stage faculty and trainees to present their
research findings during the general NMA poster session and our general IM Session meeting; and
integrate the top recipients of the abstract submissions as oral abstract presentations within the
appropriate Internal Medicine specialty presentations; (4) Promote opportunities for trainees to buttress
this academic experience by allowing them to attend an array of NMA general Scientific Section symposia
during the entire NMA Convention period; (5) Promote opportunities for early stage faculty and trainee
investigators to interact with more senior investigators working in the internal medicine specialties to
enable them the opportunity to establish professional relationships that will provide early career guidance
and for those interested “groom” them for future leadership in the NMA; (6) Provide effective tools to
address unique challenges faced by early career professional women in academia; (7) Introduce scholars
to the different academic tracts and provide guidance to achieving tenure."
10930008,"PROJECT SUMMARY: OVERALL CENTER CORE
The overarching goal of the Center Core Grant for Vision Research is to support, strengthen and broaden
basic and translational vision science research at the University of Southern California. The Center Core will
provide shared resources accessible to a group of 28 outstanding investigators, dedicated to elucidating
mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment of ocular diseases. Currently, these participating investigators
cumulatively hold 28 NIH-funded research grants, consisting of 21 grants from NEI (13 R01s, 1 R21, 7 K-
awards) and 7 grants from other institutes (4 R01s, 1 R21, 1 RF1, 1 K08). The Center Core will support 3
highly integrated Resource Cores: 1) Ophthalmic Therapeutics Engineering Core, 2) Cell & Tissue Imaging
and Data Science Core, 3) Animal Models and In Vivo Imaging Core. These Cores will offer exceptional
facilities, instrumentation and expertise that are essential resources to enhance and expand the research
programs of participating investigators, aid established investigators in pursuing research in new emerging
fields, and assist new investigators in developing vision research projects. The Center Core will also
coordinate and integrate Core activities, promote utilization of innovative emerging technologies, and facilitate
collaborative inter-disciplinary vision research. The Center Core will serve as a cornerstone for conduct of
impactful basic and translational vision research focused on advancing knowledge of the biology and
pathophysiology of the visual system and development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for
vision impairment."
10931604,"SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The goal of the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core (BBC) is to provide support to the SPORE projects,
other cores, as well as the researchers funded through the Developmental Research Program or Career
Enhancement Program in all aspects of study design and data management, processing, integration and
analysis. This proposal focuses on translational research in minority health and health equity in cancer for the
diverse populations of Hawaii, particularly the understudied Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific
Islander (AANHPI) groups. Project 1 will focus on prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma, for which Hawaii’s
AANHPI populations are at high risk, by evaluating, in a randomized clinical trial, the efficacy of an intermittent
energy restriction on reducing liver fat and liver stiffness in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with
predicted fibrosis stage 2+. Project 2 will focus on reducing the disparity for lung cancer among Native Hawaiians
through elucidation of the behavioral aspects of, and improved guidelines for, screening and the biological
characteristics of this malignancy in this population. Project 3 will focus on breast cancer prevention among
AANHPI women through calibration and addition of mammography radiomic features, associated with prognosis
and adiposity, to commonly used breast cancer risk models (e.g., Gail model). The BBC is staffed by a team
experienced in biostatistics and bioinformatics for translational research in multiethnic populations. Provision of
the highest quality support will be facilitated by having the expertise concentrated in the Core rather than in
individual projects, as this will lead to sharing of ideas and tools. The aims of the core are: 1) to provide support
for data management and integration for the projects, while ensuring data quality and security processes are
incorporated, 2) to develop and execute study design and analysis plans for each of the research projects, in
conjunction with Project Leaders, and 3) to facilitate data sharing among SPORE researchers and with the
research community. We will ensure that the most appropriate and rigorous data collection, management and
analysis approaches are used, that the flow of data and material is seamless, and that requirements for data
governance, security, and sharing are met. In addition, we will explore novel techniques, such as integrative
clustering and Bayesian methods for combining omics data, to better understand the underlying mechanisms.
The BBC as a single locus for these comprehensive activities will provide efficiency, integration and scientific
rigor that are not otherwise available."
10931608,"SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The Outreach and Recruitment Core (ORC) of this P50 application will play an integral role in the proposed
research to achieve the overarching goal of maximizing the translational impact of our ethnic disparities research
in our catchment area [Hawai`i and the US-Affiliated Pacific Islands (USAPIs)]. We will perform community
outreach and recruitment activities specifically in support of the three projects and, in the process, engage our
minority populations broadly to increase their awareness of newly identified cancer disparities and obtain their
input on our research and dissemination. The ORC team is highly experienced in community outreach, especially
in engaging local physicians and high-risk minority populations including Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians
and Pacific Islanders (AANHPI) in Hawai`i and USAPI. Also, the P50 and ORC team collectively has a strong
track record of recruiting research participants and administering complex study protocols over the past 30 years.
In Aim 1a, we will establish the P50 SPORE's Community Advisory Board (CAB) to increase public and
healthcare provider awareness of racial/ethnic and geographic cancer disparities among AANHPI in Hawai'i and
elicit community input, participation, and knowledge related to P50 research projects addressing liver, lung and
breast cancers. In Aim 1b, increase awareness of P50 SPORE's newly identified cancer disparities among
healthcare providers and patient community organizations, and engage their input and participation in P50
projects. In Aim 2, to a) conduct the recruitment and data collection for the randomized lifestyle intervention in
Project 1; b) conduct provider and community key-informant interviews, and pilot message testing for Project 2;
c) disseminate the risk assessment research and study findings to stakeholders for Project 3; and d) support the
pilot work funded by the Developmental Research Program (DRP) and Career Enhancement Program (CEP).
Bidirectional engagement with the community throughout the research process is essential for translational
research in minorities to be successful. The ORC, in collaboration with the P50 CAB, will assist current and
future P50-affiliated investigators in obtaining stakeholder and community inputs into their research. The ORC
will build on the extensive experience in community outreach and engagement activities of our Cancer Center,
the only NCI-designated cancer center in the Pacific region, and will establish the foundation for important
translational research addressing cancer disparities in our catchment area and beyond as part of a P50 SPORE."
10931610,"SUMMARY /ABSTRACT
 Access to relevant biospecimens is critical to translational research on minority populations. The lack of
research specimens from racial and ethnic minority populations in the U.S. remains a barrier to understanding
racial/ethnic differences in cancer development, progression, and outcomes. In particular, the paucity of clinical
biospecimens from understudied populations, including Native Hawaiians, other Pacific Islanders, and Asian
Americans has limited the ability to address critical disparities in cancer risk and outcomes affecting these U.S.
communities. Hawaiʻi, the most ethnically diverse state in the nation, has experienced a higher burden of
common cancers-- including liver, breast, lung, colorectum, endometrium, and stomach, compared to the U.S
overall. Moreover, wide racial and ethnic disparities are observed within Hawaiʻi's uniquely diverse multiethnic
population including Native Hawaiians who have the highest mortality for breast, liver, lung, and other common
malignancies. The value of the biospecimens collected at the University of Hawaiʻi Cancer Center (UHCC) is
evident in the breadth and scope of its translational research. Despite this progress, biorepository efforts at the
UHCC to date have been fragmented and limited for certain types of specimens, especially fresh frozen tumor
tissue. Current UHCC biospecimen resources include a statewide repository of clinically-annotated, de-identified
archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue and prospectively and retrospectively collected
blood, urine, oral rinses, and stool from consented individuals. In contrast, the collection of fresh frozen tissue
has been largely limited to small scale collections for disparate investigator-initiated studies. There is a crucial
need at UHCC to standardize and centralize the collection of fresh frozen tumor and blood from cancer patients
in our participating community hospitals and to integrate these collections with existing resources in order to
optimize their utility for cancer research. We propose to develop a Pathology and Biospecimen Core that will
integrate and augment existing and new biospecimen resources with respect to their acquisition,
processing, tracking, storage, and distribution and will support Project 1 (NASH/liver cancer), Project 2 (lung
cancer), Project 3 (breast cancer), Career Enhancement Program (CEP) and Developmental Research Program
(DRP) projects, as well as other UHCC investigations with the goal of developing a robust infrastructure to
address differences in cancer risk and outcomes in Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander
(AANHPI) ethnic minority populations. Aim 1 will focus on the development of a repository of paired fresh frozen
tumor tissue and blood specimens from multiethnic cancer cases diagnosed in the state of Hawaiʻi with cancers
of the lung, liver, breast, colorectum, endometrium, pancreas, and stomach. Potential cases will be identified via
rapid reporting from medical facilities statewide through the NCI SEER Hawaiʻi Tumor Registry. For Aim 2, we
will provide biospecimens from new and existing resources in support of Projects 1, 2, and 3, CEP and DRP
projects, and future cancer research projects."
10931612,"SUMMARY
The University of Hawai`i Cancer Center (UHCC) is the only National Cancer Institute-designated cancer
center in Hawai`i and the Pacific. The Center's mission is to reduce the burden of cancer through research,
community outreach, education and patient care with an emphasis on the unique ethnic, cultural and
environmental characteristics of Hawai`i and the Pacific. In alignment with this mission, the Developmental
Research Program (DRP) will draw upon areas of unique opportunity at UHCC to foster minority health
research that will improve our biological understanding of ethnic/racial differences in cancer risk and outcomes
in our catchment area and translate our findings into therapeutic, behavioral, and diagnostic clinical trials and
interventions that address these challenges. The DRP is a central element of the P50 for developing new
translational research projects in minority health that will nurture new lines of investigation, research
innovation, and collaboration. The funded pilot projects will provide important preliminary data for future large
research project applications and support their feasibility and impact. Also, DRP studies with translational
research potential may become full SPORE projects if the DRP study incorporates a human endpoint within
one of the project aims. Therefore, the DRP will be an engine for innovation in translational minority health
research at UHCC. As such we have integrated its activities closely with the leadership of the P50 and that of
the UHCC. Here we describe the process by which pilot projects will be solicited, reviewed, awarded, and
monitored. The goal of the DRP is to identify and fund 10 new research projects and collaborations over five
years that address minority health issues in UHCC's catchment area. In support of this goal, the DRP
coordinate pilot funding requests, reviews, and award activities and identify areas of unique opportunity and
potential collaborations. UHCC is poised to make seminal contributions to understanding and alleviating the
burden of cancer in our diverse catchment area through strategic minority health and disparities research. The
DRP will proactively take advantage of these advantages to foster creative work that will translate into
therapeutic, behavioral, and diagnostic clinical trials and interventions that directly impact minority health.
These projects will form the basis for the continued success of this minority health SPORE and expand its
impact by fostering the development of new research topics."

This proposal seeks support for a well-established training program in translational cardiovascular research for
MD and PhD postdoctoral fellows at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). The training program has
a long history of training excellence and is an essential component of the educational and training activities of
The Knight Cardiovascular Institute. Over the past decade, the program has trained many fellows, who have
been successful in obtaining independent positions in academics. Our trainees included equal numbers of men
and women and MDs and PhDs, and included fellows from under-represented minority groups. We request
funding for 6 post-doctoral fellows per year (3 positions for two years each). The program offers exciting
opportunities for bench to bedside, multidisciplinary training in one of three established Training Hubs that
specialize in: 1) Cardiovascular Regulation, which includes physiological regulation, ischemia-reperfusion and
hypertension, 2) Cardiovascular Inflammation, which includes atherosclerosis, diabetes, thrombosis, and viral
infections with relevance to cardiovascular disease (including COVID-19), and 3) Cardiovascular
Development, which includes cardiovascular genetics, genomics and fetal programming. The faculty mentors
are highly recognized and funded scientists who have a strong track record of training postdoctoral fellows. The
program is highly interdisciplinary and mentors' expertise cover a wide range of the translational spectrum.
Laboratory research is supplemented by course work, seminars, journal club, and meetings within a specific
science group. Course work includes research design, biostatistics, cardiovascular physiology and genetics. All
trainees participate in responsible conduct of research training, scientific writing, entrepreneurship and team
science and leadership training. This program is unique at OHSU in that mentoring is carried out by a
multidisciplinary team, and because training is specifically designed to translate basic cardiovascular research
into clinical benefit. The primary mentor will be assisted by at least two co-mentors, who complement the primary
mentor's expertise by bringing clinical, basic science or technical expertise. The training outcome will be
scientists with a broad outlook and a focus on bringing science to the bedside. The application includes a strong
recruitment plan for underserved minority trainees and an evaluation process. A Program Advisory Committee
monitors the progress of every trainee as they meet specific mileposts in preparation for a research career. In
summary, the proposed cardiovascular research training program will provide a unique opportunity for
multidisciplinary training, and successful trainees will be well equipped to initiate independent research careers
in translational cardiovascular research."
10811673,"Summary
Antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an important tool for preventing transmission to virus naïve
individuals and plays an important role in current efforts to end the HIV epidemic. If taken daily current oral PrEP
strategies reliably block HIV transmission. However, the requirement of strict adherence to daily pill uptake, pill
fatigue and other institutional barriers to access leave oral PrEP underutilized. Long-acting injectable PrEP
strategies have the potential to address many of the problems associated with oral PrEP but the realization of
drug formulations and delivery strategies that ensure sustained drug release for at least three months has
remained challenging and motivates the development of entirely new long-acting PrEP strategies. This project
develops a long-acting injectable PrEP strategy based on membrane-wrapped nanoparticles (NPs) that establish
cellular depots for sustained maintenance of inhibitory concentrations of antiretrovirals (ARVs) at primary tissue
sites of HIV-1 transmission in the female genital tract (FGT) and rectum. Selective targeting of CD169-expressing
macrophages and dendritic cells is accomplished through incorporation of the ganglioside GM3 in the NP
membrane. GM3-CD169 binding triggers uptake and sequestration of NPs in non-endolysosomal compartments
that share distinct similarities with virus containing compartments (VCCs) in tissue-associated macrophages and
dendritic cells. These compartments represent protected sites from where NPs can release drugs into the
surrounding tissue for an extended period of time. Membrane-wrapped inverse micelles of block copolymers will
be engineered as a GM3-NP platform for long-acting PrEP. A combination of long-acting tenofovir (TFV) and
emtricitabine (FTC) prodrugs will be used as active compounds to validate the approach. The block copolymer
NPs will contain TFV covalently linked to a polymer shell that encapsulates an aqueous core holding FTC
conjugated to dendrimers. After quantifying drug loading and release in vitro, the GM3-mediated targeting of
CD169+ myeloid cells in the FGT and rectum of a humanized mouse model will be tested. In parallel, the GM3-
NP platform will be optimized to achieve sustained drug release in the target tissues. The hypothesis that the
optimized NPs provide protection from mucosal HIV infection in a humanized mouse model for at least three
months will be tested. The specific aims of this application are:
Aim 1: To develop membrane-wrapped multicomponent NPs for sustained release of TFV/FTC.
Aim 2: To target CD169-expressing myeloid cells in the FGT and SLTs for sustained TFV/FTC release.
Aim 3: To demonstrate long-term protection from mucosal HIV-1 transmission in humanized mice by TFV/FTC
incorporating GM3-NPs."
10897323,"Work over the last decade has provided tantalizing clues that the genetic mechanisms that underlie
evolutionary trajectories may be more constrained and deterministic than previously appreciated.
Whether the genetic basis of evolution is predictable or stochastic is a fundamental question in
evolutionary biology, and the ability to predict evolutionary responses has critical implications for the
fields of agriculture, medicine and conservation. Unfortunately, we are far from understanding the
factors that underlie the predictability of evolutionary responses or the fitness consequences
associated with alternative evolutionary trajectories in nature. Surveys of replicate populations
adapting to the same environmental conditions provide an opportunity to quantify the repeatability of
evolutionary trajectories and determine the factors affecting observed patterns of variation. Several
genetic factors are hypothesized to affect the probability of a gene or mutation’s use during the
process of adaptation. However, to date there have been few empirical tests determining the
contribution of individual factors to patterns of gene re-use (parallelism) in natural populations.
 In the proposed work, we built upon our prior findings and combine innovative population
genomics, genetic engineering, and experiments to answer three core biological questions: 1)
How does parallelism translate across biological levels? 2) Which genetic factors affect
parallelism? 3) What are the fitness consequences associated with genetically distinct, yet
phenotypically similar, evolutionary trajectories? Our laboratory is well positioned to answer
these profoundly important questions about the repeatability and predictability of evolutionary
trajectories. Our model system for addressing these questions is the threespine stickleback
(Gasterosteus aculeatus), a species with bountiful genetic and genomic resources. Stickleback are
considered a textbook example of parallel phenotypic evolution; thousands of independently derived
stickleback populations have repeatedly adapted to a variety of freshwater environments. We will
survey several focal freshwater populations to examine the scaling of papalism across biological
levels and to test whether the source and type of genetic variation or epistatic interactions predict the
frequency of gene use during adaptation. The creation of genetically modified lines that differ only in
their allele frequencies at candidate loci will allow us to test whether fitness coefficients can predict
the probability of gene use (magnitude of genetic parallelism) in nature. Together this work will test
several fundamental evolutionary questions and take a first step toward determining whether the
development of a predictive evolutionary framework is possible."

Controlled presentation of proteins in time and space is essential for the coordination of biological processes in
both healthy and diseased tissue. There is a significant need to recreate and manipulate these complex dynamic
processes within 3D scaffolds to better understand their biological roles and inform regenerative therapies.
Inducing gene expression and gene editing at specific times and locations within 3D scaffolds will enable
researchers to control protein expression necessary to study basic mechanisms of cell behavior and influence
cell interactions. However, it remains a challenge to genetically manipulate cells within 3D scaffolds
noninvasively with spatial and temporal control. Further, few methods allow individual coordination of multiple
genetic manipulations within a material, rendering it difficult to replicate the complex processes observed in
tissue maturation, vascularization and wound healing. To address these challenges, my lab is developing a new
class of biomaterials, called SonoScaffolds, for controlled, ultrasound-mediated genetic manipulation of cells in
3D culture. Our overall vision is to leverage these new 3D biomaterials to study cell behavior, model disease
states and facilitate tissue repair. In our innovative approach, focused ultrasound interacts with integrated
echogenic particles within the biomaterials to locally deliver nucleic acids to cells to manipulate their protein
expression and secretion. The focused ultrasound can create user-defined 3D patterns of transfection at
controlled times. We will use this platform to address key questions regarding how spatial presentation and
timing of protein expression affects cellular behaviors in 3D, such as directed migration and chemotaxis. To
achieve this, my research program will devise ultrasound-mediated strategies to enable two essential capabilities
for genetic manipulation in scaffolds: spatiotemporal control of gene overexpression, and precise control over
CRISPR-based gene editing. A second theme of my program will generate a library of scaffold-integrated
echogenic particles that each respond to distinct ultrasound parameters thereby enabling multiplexed DNA
delivery with spatiotemporal control. While our approach is versatile and cell-type agnostic, we will first test the
SonoScaffold platform in an endothelial co-culture system for manipulation of intercellular communication in
ultrasound-defined patterns. We will use this system to facilitate guidance of endothelial cell migration for the
study of chemotaxis. This will include ultrasound-mediated expression and CRISPR knockout of multiple growth
factors both individually and in combination, providing insight into how individual factors coordinate 3D cell
behavior. Together, this work will generate a transformative new class of 3D-programmable cell culture materials
that enable noninvasive, spatiotemporally-defined genetic manipulation of embedded cells and multicellular
structures, and provide new insights into coordinated cell processes. This program will have immediate benefits
to society, enabling new and innovative studies into regulation of cell behavior by genetically manipulating cell
processes in the 3D context to advance our understanding and inform new therapeutic strategies."
10844584,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Radiation therapy (RT) is an integral part of the standard-of-care against glioblastoma (GBM).
While the addition of RT to surgery over surgery alone significantly prolongs patient survival, all
patients with GBM ultimately succumb to the disease and survival times are unacceptably low.
So far, the addition of targeted or non-targeted therapies to surgery and RT have had limited
success and indicate the need for novel strategies against this disease.
There is ample evidence supporting the heterogeneity of GBM and the existence of a small
population of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs)), relatively resistant to RT and chemotherapy, and
able to regrow the tumor. Together, treatment resistant GSCs, dispersion of cancer cells beyond
the visible tumor, large areas of hypoxia and the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) add to the challenge
GBM presents to cancer therapy.
We have previously demonstrated that radiation reactivates stem cell programs causing cellular
multipotency and plasticity, followed by the acquisition of an induced GSC state. Importantly, we
showed that this process could be targeted and that preventing the induction of GSCs led to
improved survival in animal models of GBM. We have now developed novel compounds that
cross the BBB and prevent the radiation-induced generation of GSCs. Furthermore, our
preliminary data indicate that a radiation-induced multipotent state can be utilized to allow for
terminal differentiation of GBM cells. The studies proposed in this application build on these
findings and take the research program into this exciting new direction to utilize this induced
multipotent state for altering the radiation responses of GBM."

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a devastating, progressive neurodegenerative brain disease, with no known cure.
The disease afflicts 10 million people worldwide - ~1.5 million in the U.S. alone, and ~50k-60k new cases are
diagnosed annually. Risk factors or interventions are extremely hard to evaluate as we lack objective metrics of
how PD affects the brain. The vast global availability of brain imaging has led to several promising metrics to
gauge PD progression in the brain - structural changes in the basal ganglia and motor cortex, abnormalities in
neural connectivity seen with diffusion MRI (dMRI), and disruptions of the brain’s functional synchrony across
regions, seen with resting state functional MRI (fMRI). Despite these findings, factors that affect disease severity
are difficult to discover, as most imaging studies of PD scan <100 patients. Most PD research is conducted in
isolated cohorts from the US and Europe, limiting worldwide generalizability. Factors that affect PD progression
are hard to verify, leading to a crisis of reproducibility. Responding to NIH’s call for more reproducible studies,
here we launch ENIGMA’s Worldwide Parkinson’s Initiative. ENIGMA recently published the largest
neuroimaging studies of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, epilepsy, and autism spectrum
disorder. With ENIGMA’s globally coordinated, highly powered consortium approach, we plan to overcome the
crisis of small studies with poor power and reproducibility. Pooling anatomic, diffusion and resting state functional
MRI metrics from 21 deeply assessed international cohorts - from the US, Brazil, Taiwan, New Zealand, the
Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, South Africa, China, and Russia - we ask: How does the illness affect the brain's
structure, neural connectivity, and functional synchrony? What imaging biomarkers track disease progression
and consistently predict clinical outcomes? Do genetic risk loci for PD help predict brain decline? What PD
subtypes, or clusters, can imaging identify? Combining multimodal data from 2,307 patients and 1,264 controls,
we will thoroughly evaluate predictors and brain biomarkers in PD. Our aims are to: (1) Evaluate and rank
structural, diffusion, and resting state functional MRI biomarkers of PD worldwide; (2) Evaluate the added
value of polygenic risk scores (PRS) in predicting PD brain biomarkers; (3) Predict future functional
decline in PD with machine learning, multi-modal imaging and genomics. We will use genetic data and
baseline clinical variables from PD patients and healthy controls across our cohorts to construct an ensemble of
models to predict the annual rate of change in combined scores from the Movement Disorder Society—Unified
Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale parts II and III. We will rank the best predictors of decline, and assess how
robust they are internationally. By better modeling variance in patient outcomes, our multimodal predictive model
will empower PD clinical trials by ranking biomarkers of disease burden and determining the contexts where they
are reliable, accurate, and feasible to use."
10818493,"New therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to improve immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy in small
cell lung cancer (SCLC). SCLCs rely heavily on the replication stress response (RSR) to mitigate oncogene-
induced replication stress. Major RSR components are overexpressed in SCLC and are targets of small molecule
inhibitors in clinical development. We demonstrated that RSR inhibition regulates PD-L1 expression, stimulates
the cGAS/STING/TBK1 innate immune pathway to modulate immune responses in a type 1 interferon (T1IFN)-
dependent fashion. We showed that targeting RSR with genetic or pharmacologic approaches is well-tolerated
and potentiates the antitumor response with ICB in multiple mouse xenograft and genetic SCLC models. Our
objective is to demonstrate that the novel direct link between RSR inhibition and immune sensing pathways can
improve ICB efficacy in otherwise poorly immunogenic SCLCs. Our long-term goal is to develop novel
immunotherapy approaches that can be readily translated into the clinic. Our overarching hypothesis is that RSR
inhibition potentiates DNA damage while concurrently increasing PD-L1 expression and restoring antitumor
immune responses through innate immune signaling activation and the resulting cytotoxic T-cell infiltration.
In Aim 1, we will identify the cell-intrinsic effects of RSR inhibition on PD-L1 expression, post-translational
modifications, and stabilization in SCLC by (1) defining the impact of RSR exacerbation on the AKT/GSK3β
pathway; (2) identifying how RSR inhibition regulates PD-L1 expression, glycosylation, and stabilization in
molecularly characterized human and genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM)-derived cell lines and in
vivo models; and (3) investigating the effects of RSR inhibition on PD-L1 expression in SCLC patient samples
and correlating with clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, we will determine the immunologic consequences of RSR
inhibition on: (1) cGAS/STING-mediated innate immune pathway activation and the T1IFN response; (2)
adaptive immunity and immune cell subsets in immunocompetent in vivo SCLC models; and (3) patient samples.
In Aim 3, we will develop a therapeutic strategy combining RSR inhibitors with the current standard-of-care (anti-
PD-L1+chemotherapy) in SCLC by (1) testing the antitumor efficacy of small molecule RSR inhibitors in
combination with chemoimmunotherapy in autochthonous SCLC tumors in GEMMs; and (2) developing
biomarkers that predict the therapeutic efficacy of RSR inhibition in combination with anti-PD-L1 and
chemotherapy. In this aim we will dissect the immune changes, at a single cell resolution.
I have a track record of productivity in studying SCLC and RS biology and have assembled a multidisciplinary
team with expertise in immunology, single-cell technologies, bioinformatics, and mouse models. The proposed
research will define a new connection between RSR signaling, PD-L1 expression, and innate immunity. The
results will outline a novel therapeutic opportunity to use RSR inhibitors to rescue the efficacy of ICB in SCLC,
the most aggressive form of lung cancer, which is highly relevant to the mission of the NCI."
11141271,"Project Summary
The overarching objective of this application is to develop an image-guided therapy paradigm for
improving the management of gastric cancer (GCa) by targeting fibrin in the tumor
microenvironment. GCa is the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related death
worldwide. Despite progress in management of advanced GCa, the prognosis remains poor with a median
survival of 12-14 months even with combination chemotherapy. Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches are of
utmost need to improve clinical outcomes in patients with advanced disease.
The central hypothesis is that high energy beta particle radiotherapy targeted to the fibrin in tumor
microenvironment improves the treatment outcome of GCa. Primary and metastatic gastric tumors have
leaky vasculature which results in extravasation of blood proteins and abundant deposition of fibrin in the
extracellular matrix (ECM). Given that fibrin is only present in the tumors and thrombi, but not in healthy
tissues, we posit that fibrin could be used as a therapeutic target, representing a large depot in the ECM for a
high energy beta particle to kill surrounding tumor cells. Collagen Medical has developed and licensed patented
fibrin-specific short cyclic peptides and derivatized them for imaging and therapy. We have shown that fibrin-
targeted positron emission tomography (PET) can detect thrombi in patients using a copper-64 modified peptide,
yet provides minimal background PET signal in tissues where GCa metastasizes.
Our preliminary data shows that the fibrin-specific probe, 64Cu-CM500, detects fibrin in a mouse model
of GCa. We have also modified the peptide to incorporate the high energy beta emitter yttrium-90 for targeted
therapy. Building upon this preliminary data, in this FastTrack project we propose to establish
a theranostic approach to treating GCa by using 64Cu-CM500 PET to identify patients with fibrin-rich gastric
tumors and then treating them with fibrin-targeted 90Y-CM600 beta emitting radiotherapy. In Phase 1 we
will evaluate the extent of fibrin deposition in a wide range of human GCa tissue arrays to estimate
the prevalence of fibrin in GCa. We will also demonstrate the specificity of our compounds for both detecting
tumor fibrin and for targeting fibrin for radiotherapy. In Phase 2 we will evaluate the kinetics of 64Cu-CM500
PET in tumors in GCa patients and estimate how long the probe remains bound to the tumor. We will also
demonstrate the efficacy of 90Y-CM600 radiotherapy in multiple mouse models of GCa and optimize the
treatment regimen.
Lastly, to enable clinical translation of this therapeutic, we will synthesize the CM600 precursor under cGMP
conditions, validate the 90Y radiolabeling method, and perform IND enabling GLP toxicity, biodistribution and
dosimetry studies in rodents."
10902053,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common disease that is partly due to protein misfolding and
aggregation. Research on AD is a national priority with 5.5 million Americans affected at an annual
cost of more than $250 billion and no available cure. This is despite heavy investments in the
collection of diverse clinical and biological data in experimental and population-based studies.
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have the potential to reveal patterns in clinical and
multi-source large-scale Alzheimer’s data that have not been found using standard approaches.
We propose here a comprehensive biomedical computing and health informatics research project
to develop and apply cutting-edge AI algorithms and biomedical software for the analysis of large-
scale AD data. At the heart of this proposed informatics program is the PennAI method and
software for automating machine learning through an AI algorithm that can learn from prior
analyses. This approach takes the guesswork out of picking the right machine learning algorithms
and parameter settings thus making this computing technology accessible to everyone.
Specifically, we will develop three novel informatics methods to tailor PennAI to the analysis of
AD data. First, we will develop a Multi-Modal Interaction (M2I) feature selection algorithm for
identifying genetic interactions that are predictive of AD (AIM 1). Second, we will develop a
Knowledge-driven Multi-omics Integration (KMI) algorithm for combining omics features for AI
analysis of AD (AIM 2). Third, we will develop a Multidimensional Brain Imaging Omics (MBIO)
integration framework for the joint analysis of multi-source large-scale data for predicting AD.
Finally, we will integrate all three biomedical informatics methods into our open-source PennAI
software package and apply it to two large population-based studies of AD. We expect PennAI
will reveal new biomarkers for AD that will open the door for better treatments and clinical decision
support."
10898859,"Summary
 In response to PAR-19-269, “Cognitive Systems Analysis of Alzheimer's Disease Genetic and Phenotypic
Data”, we propose developing and applying more powerful and robust machine learning methods for causal and
integrative analysis, especially deep learning approaches for instrumental variable analysis, to identify causal
risk/protective factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the post-GWAS era by leveraging published large-scale
GWAS, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and other omic and neuroimaging data. Our main motivation is to ex-
tend an emerging and increasingly inﬂuential approach of integrating GWAS with gene expression data, called
transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), aiming to improve over the current practice of GWAS by not only
increasing statistical power, but also identifying (putative) causal genes, thus gaining insights into the genetic basis
of common diseases and complex traits. The statistical principle underlying TWAS is the (two-sample) two-stage
least squares (2SLS) for linear models in the framework of instrumental variable (IV) analysis for causal inference.
In practice, however, TWAS may fail to identify true causal genes while giving false positives due to the violation
of its modeling assumptions, e.g., due to non-linear effects of IVs or gene expression, or due to invalid IVs (in the
presence of horizontal pleiotropy of SNPs). First, we propose developing linear models and neural network models
incorporating a large number of functional annotations on the genome (e.g. various types of functional genomic
and epigenetic data from the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects) as prior knowledge to improve im-
puting/predicting gene expression (or other molecular or imaging endophenotypes or complex traits/diseases) via
SNPs, corresponding to the ﬁrst stage of 2SLS. Second, we propose neural networks as more ﬂexible non-linear
models for the second stage of 2SLS in the presence of invalid IVs, which may be the SNPs having direct (or
horizontal pleiotropic) effects on the outcome as expected from the wide-spread pleiotropy. Then we combine the
approaches in the above two stages to form a more ﬂexible and robust neural network approach as an extension of
2SLS for causal inference. Third, we consider inferring causal directions between two traits, e.g. a gene's expres-
sion and AD, allowing non-linear relationships between SNPs and traits and between the two traits. This is critical
in reducing false positives, e.g. due to reverse causation, but has been largely under-studied. Fourth, we apply the
new (and existing) methods to transcriptomic, proteomic, neuroimaging and AD GWAS/WGS data to identify (pu-
tative) causal genes, proteins and brain regions of interest (ROIs) for AD, while building the corresponding genetic
prediction models for endophenotypes and AD risk. Finally, we will develop and disseminate publicly available
software implementing the proposed analysis methods, e.g. as Python programs or R packages, to facilitate the
wide use by the scientiﬁc community."
10904692,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Studies in healthy individuals have shown that acquired DNA mutations are surprisingly common in normal-
appearing tissues. Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) mutations are acquired mutations in the blood present in the
majority of older individuals. CH mutations are also frequent among individuals with solid malignancy; are
associated with past receipt of oncologic therapy, in particular radiation therapy; and are associated with worse
overall survival. This project will address key knowledge gaps by investigating whether CH mutations are
associated with adverse oncologic treatment toxicity and outcomes in patients with solid malignancy (Aim 1),
how oncologic therapy impacts the frequency and characteristics of CH mutations in patients with solid
malignancy (Aim 2), and whether there are actionable intermediary biomarkers of adverse outcomes among
individuals with CH mutations (Aim 3). We will address these aims by undertaking targeted DNA sequencing
using existing biospecimens from prospective cohorts of patients undergoing oncologic therapy for solid
malignancy (Aims 1 and 2) and using existing clinical and genetic data from a large prospective biobank (Aim
3). Our approach leverages unique patient resources and novel methodology. Completion of these aims will
provide key insight regarding the importance of CH mutations in patients with solid malignancy and guide
future investigations to determine whether knowledge of CH mutations can improve cancer care. The
applicant, Dr. Kevin T. Nead, MD, MPhil, is an assistant professor in epidemiology and radiation oncology at
MD Anderson Cancer Center. This study is in line with Dr. Nead’s long-term career goal to become an
independent, R01 funded investigator studying the use of inherited and acquired patient-level genetic data to
improve cancer prevention and treatment paradigms. The overall career development objectives of Dr. Nead’s
proposal are to 1) expand his knowledge and expertise in genetics/genomics, bioinformatics, somatic mutation
analysis, and study design; 2) complete an interdisciplinary research plan and establish a published body of
work on acquired mutations in normal tissues and oncology care; and 3) build a platform for his successful
transition to an independent investigator. During the award period Dr. Nead will devote at least 75% of his
effort to the proposed project and career development activities. Dr. Paul Scheet, the candidate’s primary
mentor, is chair of the Department of Epidemiology, an international expert in the study of acquired mutations
in normal tissue, and has received multiple awards for the quality of his mentorship and teaching. Dr. Nead will
also benefit from the rich training environment and outstanding resources and mentorship available at MD
Anderson Cancer Center for the proposed project. Completion of the proposed research and career
development plan will give Dr. Nead the necessary knowledge and skills to transition to independence and to
pursue an impactful career improving cancer prevention and care."
10700379,"Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous cancer in US men and among Veterans. Many cases are
non-lethal, but prostate cancer remains the 2nd leading cause of cancer death among US men. A major barrier
to reducing the incidence of prostate cancer metastasis and death is the lack of an optimal screening strategy
to identify men at high risk. Screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing modestly reduces prostate
cancer deaths but increases the morbidity associated with overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Current screening
approaches do not adequately distinguish men without prostate cancer or with low-grade prostate cancer
amenable to active surveillance from men with clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa), who need
treatment. As a result, guidelines do not recommend universal prostate cancer screening. However, a new
paradigm of precision screening might improve the benefit-to-harm ratio of screening by implementing
screening strategies tailored to an individual's specific genetic profile. Germline genetic testing has emerged as
a powerful predictor for prostate cancer, including csPCa. This includes both rare highly penetrant variants and
polygenic risk scores (PRS), which characterize an individual's predisposition to prostate cancer due to
common genetic variation. Rare and common genetic variation is now an equally powerful predictor of
clinically significant disease as self-reported race or family history. This CSR&D Combined Proof of Concept
and Clinical Trial will evaluate the promise of precision risk stratification to identify men most likely to benefit
from prostate cancer screening. During the proof-of-concept phase, it will achieve the following: 1) Develop a
precision prostate cancer screening intervention consisting of genetic testing for rare variants and a
transancestry PRS for delivery to participants and their primary care providers along with individualized,
genetic risk-informed screening recommendations. 2) Determine the feasibility of enrolling men aged 55-70, at
least 35% of whom are of racial/ethnic minority groups, to a pragmatic randomized clinical trial (RCT)
comparing the precision screening intervention to usual care. 3) Perform an interim assessment to determine
whether the observed trajectory of prostate biopsy event rates is consistent with rates needed to detect a
meaningful between-group difference at the end of the 7-year project period. If feasibility of enrollment and
adequate event rates are demonstrated during the proof-of-concept phase, the RCT will continue to the clinical
trial phase to test the following co-primary hypotheses: 1) Compared with men in the usual care arm, men in
the precision screening arm will have a time-to-diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa,
defined as NCCN classification intermediate risk or higher) that is not inferior by a margin of >30 days over a
median 4 years of follow-up; 2) Compared with usual care, men in the precision screening arm overall will
undergo fewer prostate biopsies over a median 4 years of follow-up. Pre-specified subgroup analyses will test
these hypotheses in Black men specifically, to evaluate whether this population benefits equally from the
intervention. Enrollees will be followed for additional outcomes including all prostate cancer diagnoses, PSA
testing, prostate MRI, rare variants identified, preferences for or against prostate cancer screening, and health-
related quality of life. The expectation is that precision screening will increase screening among high-risk
patients but decrease screening among low- and average-risk patients, thereby maintaining or improving
overall csPCa detection while improving the population-level benefit-to-harm ratio. Rigorous RCT evidence
that genetic risk-informed screening maintains the benefits of screening while minimizing the harms of
unnecessary procedures and treatments among low-risk men will change clinical practice and policy around
prostate cancer screening."
10840336,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-1 persists in the latent reservoir lifelong. Although most HIV-
1-infected cells die of viral cytopathic effects or immune clearance, HIV-1-infected cells, even those having active
HIV-1 expression, can survive, persist, and proliferate. We want to examine how HIV-1 establishes infection
during viremia and persists under viral suppression in people living with HIV-1. Understanding the immune cell
subsets, immune programs, and cell markers of HIV-1-infected cells will identify therapeutic targets. The
challenge is the heterogeneity and rarity of HIV-1-infected cells: in ART-treated, virally suppressed individuals,
only 1–100/106 (<0.01%) CD4+ T cells harbor inducible HIV-1. To this end, we profiled CD4+ T cells from the
Sabes cohort during viremia and after viral suppression using single-cell ECCITEseq, which captures single-cell
transcriptome, protein expression, HIV-1 RNA, and T cell receptor sequence (TCR) within the same single cell.
We have established advanced single-cell bioinformatic analysis pipelines and machine learning tools. This
approach enables multi-dimensional, high-resolution, single-cell profiling of immune cell subsets, immune
programs, cell markers, T cell clonal expansion, and HIV-1 RNA+ cells at the same time. Our single-cell
ECCITEseq found that HIV-1 RNA+ cells upregulated cytotoxic CD4+ T cell genes. Using flow cytometric
measurement of HIV-1 p24 protein and granzyme B expression, our RNA-seq based results were validated by
a protein-based orthogonal approach, revealing that HIV-1 persists by hiding in granzyme B+ cytotoxic effector
memory CD4+ T cells. Based on our results from viremic samples, we can examine the rare HIV-1 RNA+ cells
under suppressive ART over time. Using single-cell ECCITEseq, we found that despite suppressive ART, tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) responses persist. Furthermore, antigen and TNF responses drive the proliferation of T
cell clones. In addition, different antigen responses drive distinct T cell polarization and proliferation. Altogether,
we hypothesize that antigen stimulation and TNF responses can shape T cell polarization, cellular susceptibility
to HIV-1 infection, cellular survival, and proliferation of the infected cells, particularly granzyme B cytotoxic CD4+
T cells. Our goal is to understand why HIV-1-infected cytotoxic CD4+ T cells can preferentially survive, proliferate,
and persist, as opposed to other T cell subsets. Achieving this goal will identify immune programs that drive
HIV-1 persistence and identify cell markers for HIV-1-infected cells for more specific therapeutic targeting. Our
approach is to combine cutting-edge single-cell ECCITEseq and orthogonal validations to examine how HIV-1
RNA+ granzyme B+ CTLs survive and persist under viral suppression by profiling cell subsets, immune program,
markers, and proliferation dynamics for the rare HIV-1 RNA+ cells over time during viral suppression in vivo and
in vitro. Overall, we will understand why HIV-1 preferentially persists in cytotoxic CD4+ T cells, identify upstream
immune drivers promoting the survival and proliferation of the HIV-1-infected cytotoxic CD4+ T cells, and guide
the development of therapeutic strategies specific for HIV-1-infected cells."
10848501,"Project Summary
High-throughput profiling of hundreds of thousands of cells in the central nervous system (CNS) is currently
underway. One of the goals of the BRAIN initiative is to build a census of cell types in the CNS, however
previous work in single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) has demonstrated that reliance on small collections
of marker genes for cell type/state/position classification is insufficient to account for the dynamic nature of and
variation in cellular classes/states. Previous work from both myself and others has demonstrated that latent
space methods identify low dimensional patterns from high dimensional profiling data can discover molecular
drivers of cell types and states in scRNAseq. However, the use of algorithms untethered to biological
constraints or not extensively functionally validated can lead to the arbitrary delineation of cell class/state and
the trivial designation of “novel” cell types. As proper development of the CNS requires precise regulation and
coordination of spatial and temporal cues, the overall objective of this application is to develop analytic and
experimental methods that integrate spatiotemporal information with scRNAseq to learn meaningful latent
spaces. Specifically, I will 1) generate a comprehensive collection of transcriptional signatures for spatial
features of the brain, 2) build dimension reduction software to encode spatial and cell cycle information to
account for the highly specific organization of cells in the CNS, 3) derive a statistic, projectionDrivers, that
allows for quantification of the gene drivers of differential latent space usage, and 4) define a statistic,
proMapR, that will tell you the probability of a cell existing in a particular location in the brain at a given point in
time from the cell's transcriptional signature. The ability to define and validate biologically meaningful latent
spaces not only enables multiOmic data integration and exploratory analysis of scRNA-seq data via the
massive amount of publicly available data, but also lays the groundwork for multimodal data integration—a
necessary next step to characterize how individual cells and complex neural circuits interact in both time and
space."
10867384,"Innate defensive behaviors promote survival by allowing animals to detect and respond to threats within their environment, such as predators. Although innate, these defensive behaviors show a remarkable amount of flexibility and are subject to robust habituation, suggesting that the circuitry underlying defensive behaviors is subject to modulatory control. Our recent work suggests that the cerebellum may provide one source of afferent modulatory influence within the periaqueductal gray. We find that cerebellar afferents to the freezing-related circuitry in ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) predominantly activate local dopaminergic interneurons, which subsequently alter the relative strength of synaptically evoked inhibition and excitation onto freezing premotor neurons. More specifically, cerebellar activation increases IPSC amplitudes and decreases EPSC amplitudes, which is predicted to increase spike threshold and alter the input-output relationship, altering the integrative properties of freezing premotor neurons. These results motivate testing the hypothesis that the cerebellum modulates the expression of innate defensive behaviors through activation of local vlPAG dopamine neurons. To test this hypothesis, a combination of in vivo behavioral and systems-level approaches will be used to manipulate cerebellar input and record cerebellar activity during innate freezing behaviors to determine the nature of the cerebellar signals produced, and their resulting effects on expression of freezing behavior. To study the role of vlPAG dopamine neurons in modulating innate freezing behaviors, I will similarly record and manipulate vlPAG dopamine neuron activity using fiber photometry and optogenetic actuators. Finally, because selective lesions of vlPAG dopamine neurons disrupt both fear memory formation in mice (as do disruptions in cerebellar plasticity), I will test the hypothesis that cerebellar associative plasticity contributes to fear memory formation by modulating vlPAG dopamine activity. Together, these experiments provide a framework for understanding how the cerebellum modulates both innate freezing and more broadly how cerebellar plasticity contributes to learned defensive behaviors."
10703718,"Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of epilepsy in adults and is associated with significant cognitive decline. In over 40% of TLE cases, seizures are not controlled with current treatment options and systemic anti-epileptic drug administration can have major negative side effects, prompting the need for more effective therapies. However, the cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying TLE are not yet understood due to the inherent challenges of studying chronic spontaneous seizures which typically occur within a relatively short temporal window, often on a timescale of seconds to minutes. Using a recently developed molecular tool, which integrates light and calcium to label active cells within a short temporal window, along with a closed-loop system for seizure detection and light delivery, preliminary results identified a distinct cluster of cells within the hippocampus prominently active during seizures. Additional preliminary work identifies this region as also involved during interictal epileptiform events, suggesting it is a critical control node in the development of seizures. This proposal will employ two different models of TLE, a recently developed focal genetic knockout model and the intrahippocampal kainite model, to dissect the role of this ensemble and 1) Determine its involvement in both interictal and ictal activity in chronically epileptic animals; 2) Determine whether optogenetic inhibition of these cells during seizures can control chronic spontaneous seizures and its associated cognitive comorbidities using a transgenic mouse line that provides access to this distinct population of cells; and 3) Determine whether early intervention in this region can prevent the progression of epilepsy and its associated cognitive comorbidities. The candidate has assembled an Advisory Committee comprised of Gyorgy Buzsaki, Liqun Luo, and Alice Ting to support the acquisition of additional training in closed-loop control of neuronal oscillations, cleared tissue imaging and gene expression analysis, and molecular tool development. In addition, the candidate proposes a personalized plan for career development comprised of additional experience in grant writing, teaching, and scientific management to facilitate success as an independent researcher. The candidate’s long-term goal is to develop a career as an independent neuroscientist utilizing multi-scale investigation at the level of molecules, cells, circuits, and behavior to understand mechanisms of neuronal function and their dysfunction in neurological disorders such as epilepsy. Completion of the proposed study will advance the field by 1) Establishing a previously unknown relationship between interictal and ictal activity; 2) Identifying the therapeutic potential of intervention in a previously unexplored area of the hippocampus to control seizures and associated cognitive deficits; and 3) Identify seizure-specific cellular ensembles for further study.

10912584,"ABSTRACT (OVERALL)
Aging is the greatest risk factor for most common chronic human diseases and a logical target for developing
interventions to prevent, mitigate or reverse multiple age-related morbidities. Over the past two decades, genetic
and pharmacologic interventions targeting conserved pathways of growth and metabolism have consistently led
to substantial extension of the lifespan and healthspan in model organisms as diverse as nematodes, flies and
mice. It is imperative to extend the results obtained with model organisms to aging humans. In this proposed
renewal of our U19 project “Genetic variant-based drug discovery targeting conserved pathways of aging” we
propose to continue using human centenarians to identify genetic variants as targets for developing drugs that
improve human healthy aging. During the first funding period, we identified rare variants and longevity pathways
in our centenarian cohort including coding variants in IGF-1R, SIRT6, and ATM, and functional non-coding
variants in FOXO3A, SIRT6 and components of the IKK/NF-B pathway, RelA/p65, NFKB1/p50 and NFKB1a
(IB). Having established the feasibility of using the genetics of human centenarians to identify genes and
pathways as candidates for potential drug targets for promoting human healthspan, the focus of this renewal
application will be to expand the program through whole exome analysis of our own, significantly expanded
cohort and other centenarian cohorts, further gene functionalization, the use of novel mouse models of
accelerated aging to validate the role of the rare variants and pathways in healthy longevity, and expansion of
our pipeline of screening for candidate interventions. To accomplish these goals, we propose an interdisciplinary
approach, making full use of the latest advances in cellular genomics, high-throughput functional screening, stem
cell biology, mouse and human genetics and drug screening. This renewal application is comprised of four
projects. Project 1: Genetic analysis of extreme human longevity (Zhang, Dong, and Vijg); Project 2: Identification
of functional genetic rare variants (Suh and Yu), Project 3: Validation and characterization of rare variants in
mouse models of aging (Niedernhofer) and Project 4: Development of novel therapeutics targeting the identified
variants and pathways (Robbins and Gorbunova). There is also one Research Resource Core for Data
Integration and Sharing (Core B; Zhang and Dong) as well as an Administrative Core (Core A; Vijg, Robins and
Barzilai). We expect that the continued and expanded use of the human centenarian cohorts will allow us to
obtain more detailed genetic information critical for identifying targets for the development of drugs for extending
human healthspan, for example, by increasing resilience to Alzheimer’s Disease pathology."
10869965,"Accumulating research indicates that a TBI sustained in early or middle adulthood has the potential to
influence the trajectory of the aging process, both in the context of brain function and whole-body health.
People who consider themselves to be fully recovered and asymptomatic many years following a brain injury
might actually exhibit poorer function than peers who did not experience a head injury. The TBI literature
reveals compelling evidence that TBI can elicit long-term abnormal cascades of neuroendocrine and
neuroinflammatory processes that alter the structural and functional integrity of brain networks. However, there
is little direct evidence to establish whether “normal” age-related neurodegeneration and decline of physical
and cognitive function are made worse by a TBI that occurred many years earlier. By understanding the
chronic effects of “aging with a TBI” we can better identify potential interventions to reduce negative
repercussions across the lifespan. This is an important area of investigation, considering there is a substantial
window of opportunity for Veterans who have experienced a TBI to engage in rehabilitative interventions and
lifestyle modifications that may preserve function as they transition to older age. The overarching hypothesis of
this new line of research is that participants who experienced a moderate TBI in early or middle adulthood (at
least 15 years prior to study enrollment) will have poorer performance on balance and cognitive tests, despite
self-reporting no persistent motor or cognitive impairment from the TBI. We also seek to evaluate the potential
for practice-based learning and improvement of complex balance tasks in this population, in order to gain
experience for conducting future rehabilitation studies. Veterans with prior TBI (TBI+ group) will be compared
to a control group who report no history of TBI (TBI- group). We propose to enroll Veterans who are
transitioning into older age (i.e., age between 50-65 years). This study will focus on balance function because
of its close association with fall risk. Falls and resultant injuries are a major cause of disability in older Veterans
and civilians, which poses a substantial rehabilitation demand and cost to individuals and society. The
significance of balance deficits and falls will only grow in the coming years, as more than 50% of all Veterans
will be 65 years or older by 2050. Further, loss of balance is very common in the acute stage of recovery from
TBI, suggesting damage to neural control pathways/networks that might be susceptible to chronic effects. As
secondary outcomes, we will conduct assessments that are related to balance function (including cognitive and
oculomotor function) and that increase the risk of injuries due to a fall (bone mineral density). The TBI literature
suggests that these secondary outcomes are also susceptible to the chronic effects of a TBI. The first aim of
the study is to determine if TBI+ participants have impaired balance, cognition, and oculomotor performance
compared to TBI- participants. The second aim of the study is to evaluate the potential for practice-based
learning of balance tasks requiring visuospatial cognitive engagement. In addition to the proposed group
analyses, we will also conduct exploratory regression analysis within the TBI+ participants to examine potential
relationships between the severity of injury and continuous measures of motor and cognitive performance. The
knowledge and experience gained from this study will prepare us to conduct larger studies to better understand
the chronic effects of aging with a TBI, as well as prepare us to test rehabilitation interventions to promote
healthy aging in this population."
10874486,"Project Summary/Abstract
Syphilis in women is usually a silent infection caused by Treponema pallidum (T. pallidum) that can efficiently
cross the placenta during all stages of pregnancy and infect the fetus. In the absence of timely diagnosis and
treatment, the natural history of infection in pregnancy includes adverse birth outcomes in 80% (spontaneous
abortion, stillbirth, low birthweight, preterm delivery, congenital syphilis, and neonatal death). Our team and
others have documented elevated prevalence of syphilis in pregnancy in Cameroon and Zambia (3-6%) with
high HIV coinfection rates (10-40%). Despite public health efforts, syphilis is the leading preventable cause of
stillbirth globally and available diagnostic testing has critical limitations in pregnant women and infants. The
Syphilis in Pregnancy Study (SIPS): Molecular Diagnostics and Maternal and Infant Immune Response to
Infection brings together an international team of experts in perinatal and pediatric clinical infectious diseases,
syphilis molecular biology and immunology to address priority questions in the STI field about the natural
history of syphilis in pregnancy and vertical transmission. The SIPS team has designed an observational
cohort to enroll and follow 750 well-characterized pregnant women with confirmed syphilis and their exposed
infants as well as 750 pregnant controls in Cameroon and Zambia with follow up and repeated sample
collection through 12 months after delivery. SIPS participants will have pre- and post-treatment blood samples,
cord blood, and placentas collected from women, neonates, and infants to assess immune responses in
addition to oral and lesion swabs for PCR testing to carry out the following aims: Aim 1: Identify clinical and
host factors independently associated with favorable birth outcomes among pregnant women with syphilis;
Aim 2: Characterize the adaptive T. pallidum immune response before and after treatment in pregnant women
and their exposed infants; Aim 3: Evaluate quantitative PCR (qPCR) testing on oral and lesion swabs to detect
T. pallidum and enhance diagnostic testing in pregnancy and neonates. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that
factors associated with robust maternal immunity will be associated with favorable birth outcomes in
multivariable models with clinical and host factors. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that a robust adaptive immune
response (humoral immunity and CD4 T cells) will protect against vertical transmission and assess the role of
T. pallidum-specific transplacental maternal antibodies in mediating fetal and infant protection. Aim 3 will test
our hypothesis that newly developed molecular diagnostic testing of easily collected oral swabs will help refine
and improve the diagnosis of syphilis in pregnant women and infants. Our expected outcome is to identify T.
pallidum antigens with a role in dissemination, placental attachment, and vertical transmission. Our long-term
goals are to advance these newly identified antigens as potential vaccine candidates for reproductive age
women and to support syphilis diagnostic testing with highly specific molecular testing and specific antigens
that can discern syphilis stage and treatment response in pregnant women and infants."

10883759,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The bone marrow niche houses hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), cells that self-renew and differentiate into vital
blood components like white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. HSCs are supported by other marrow
resident cells, like vascular endothelial cells and stromal cells, that nourish the marrow with essential signals.
Unfortunately, radiation and/or chemotherapy used to treat cancer patients injure the bone marrow niche.
Damaged bone marrow function places patients at potentially fatal risks from low blood counts. Because blood
cancers are exquisitely sensitive to radiation, targeted radiation delivery via radioimmunotherapy, or target-
specific antibodies stably linked to radioactive isotopes, has been developed to treat hematologic malignancies,
though some have with slow bone marrow recovery. Despite increasing clinical trials evaluating
radioimmunotherapies, how these delivered radionuclides impact the cellular, molecular, and systemic
mechanisms that regulate the bone marrow niche has yet to be identified. The impact of radioimmunotherapy
on the bone marrow niche must be addressed if radioimmunotherapies are to gain traction, and specifics on
these mechanisms can be leveraged to minimize radiation-induced marrow toxicity. Further complicating the
utility of radioimmunotherapy, radionuclides have distinct payload characteristics with unknown consequences
on the bone marrow niche. This proposal will uncover the differential effects of an alpha-emitter (astatine-211)
and a beta-emitter (yttrium-90) compared to non-targeted X-ray radiation to procure essential knowledge to
advance these technologies clinically. We will report how these radiation types differentially regulate the
abundance and function of HSCs, endothelial and stromal cells, essential regulators of hematologic function. We
will also compare how radiation targeting impacts bone marrow components by comparing how
radioimmunotherapy using a broad hematologic marker (CD45) and more restricted surface marker (CD33)
impacts bone marrow components. Experimentally, we will use in vivo competitive transplantation assays in mice
to assess long-term and short-term HSC potential as a function of radioimmunotherapy. These studies will be
coupled with flow cytometry to quantify how radiation type regulates hematopoietic, vascular, and stromal cell
frequency, death, and proliferation. We will leverage cutting-edge confocal imaging with thick femur sections to
understand how radioimmunotherapy differentially regulates the three-dimensional bone marrow architecture,
critical for vascular niche function and hematologic recovery from irradiation. More importantly, differential gene
expression in the HSC, endothelial and stromal cell compartments, as a response to differential radionuclide
delivery, will also be quantified using RNA sequence analyses. The results from these experiments stand to
identify mechanisms responsible for radiation injury in HSCs, and the endothelial and stromal cell response
systems that can be manipulated to derive a desired clinical outcome, and give providers the tools to accelerate
bone marrow recovery, or inhibit residual hematopoiesis as desired in bone marrow stem cell transplantation."
10912034,"Project Summary
Suicide is the 5th leading cause of death among children aged 5-11 (CDC, 2020). Rates of child suicide has
increased by 68% in the last decade, with rates significantly higher among Black compared to white children
(Bridge et al., 2018). The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has identified suicide prevention as an
urgent priority, particularly for groups at highest risk. Most studies of suicidality have been conducted in majority
White samples, leaving the experiences of Black children left out of scientific efforts to reduce youth suicide.
Thus, there is in urgent need for developmentally and culturally informed research on suicidality. In this
application we propose to adapt a widely used model for understanding the development of suicidal thoughts
and the transition from thoughts to behavior, the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS; Joiner,
2005), according to which hopelessness in the context of lack of belongingness and burdensomeness leads to
suicidal ideation, and capacity to engage in self-harm leads to suicidal behavior. Components of the IPTS have
been reliably measured in adolescents and children as young as 10 years (Horton et al., 2016; Roberts et al.,
2020; Stewart, et al., 2017). The model was further elaborated to be relevant for Black youth by including
exposure to systemic, structural, and interpersonal racism as risks for and racial socialization and identity as
protective against suicidality (Robinson et al., 2021). We propose to test the reliability, validity, and stability of a
developmentally and culturally informed IPTS model beginning in early childhood (age 4-6 years) in Black youth.
The Pittsburgh Girls Study (PGS) is a 20-year longitudinal study of 2,450 women who were initially enrolled when
they were between the ages of 5 and 8 years. We propose to enroll 300 Black offspring of PGS participants and
will enrich the sample by recruiting children of mothers with a history of suicidal ideation and attempts, which
have been measured prospectively for 20 years. We aim to recruit two age groups of children: 5–7-year-olds
and 7–9-year-olds. Both groups will be assessed six times at 9-month intervals, through ages 10-12 years. This
design will allow us to test the reliability, validity, and stability from early childhood to early adolescence of
hypothesized constructs of the suicidal process measured across multiple systems. Along with data from parent-
and self-report, heart rate variability and mood will be measured in response to age-appropriate probes:
Cyberball, parent-child tasks, loss/failure tasks, and the Balloon Analogue Reaction Task, which are
hypothesized to yield individual differences in loneliness, connectedness, self-worth and hopelessness, and
impulsivity. Embedding a study of early childhood suicide phenotypes in Black children of PGS participants will
allow robust tests of early risk and stability of suicidality in the context of culturally relevant risk and protective
factors including exposure to systemic, structural, and interpersonal racism, and racial socialization and identity.
Testing the proposed aims will yield suicidal phenotypes that are relevant for young Black children and that will
contribute to efforts to reverse the recent trends in Black youth suicide."
10847461,"Medulloblastoma (MB), is the most common pediatric brain tumor originating in the GABA-rich cerebellum. 40% of MB
patients present as both cerebellar and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) leptomeningeal metastases which results in having dismal
outcomes. The project’s long-term goal is to determine how MB become life-threatening leptomeningeal metastases by
studying the tumor and brain microenvironment from a neurodevelopment and cancer neuroscience perspective. Although
abnormal GABAergic receptor activation has been described in group 3 MB, no studies until ours recently had yet
to elucidate the contribution of receptor-independent GABA metabolism to MB pathogenesis and metastasis. Overall,
we were the first to identify GABA metabolic shunt enzyme GABA Transaminase (ABAT) expression is correlated with
cerebellar development and is used by MB to survive in the cerebrospinal fluid microenvironment and promote
leptomeningeal dissemination. Specifically, we show proliferative MB cells at the primary cerebellar site have low ABAT.
However, a sub-population of ABAT positive MB cells at the primary cerebellar site display neuron-like characteristics
(including metabolism) and are the seeds of MB metastasis. In addition to being a GABA metabolic enzyme, we determined
that expression of ABAT induces epigenetic modification by significantly reducing histone acetylation at the 4th lysine
residue of the histone H3 protein (H3K4ac) and significantly increase in histone deacetylase activity. Furthermore, ABAT
expression fluctuates depending on metabolite changes in the tumor microenvironment, with nutrient-poor conditions
upregulating ABAT expression. We found metastatic MB cells require ABAT to maintain viability in the metabolite-scarce
CSF by using GABA through the GABA metabolic shunt as an energy source substitute, thereby facilitating leptomeningeal
metastasis formation. Therefore, we hypothesize ABAT has a dual-biological role: lack of its expression during normal
cerebellar development contributes to proliferation leading to group 3 medulloblastoma formation; While its
overexpression after MB development results in tumor dormancy leading to survival benefit in disseminated cells in
leptomeningeal metastasis. Utilizing foundations of neurobiology by using: a) human and mouse-derived neural stem cells,
neurons and glial cells, b) unique strengths of patient-xenografts, c) BarTeL transgenic mice, d) novel small molecule ABAT
inhibitor which crosses the blood-brain barrier, we will: 1st interrogate the role of ABAT in cerebellar neurodevelopment
and Group 3 MB initiation, 2nd contribution of nuclear ABAT to transcription through histone acetylation modification in
metastases, 3rd investigate ABAT as a potential therapeutic target for MB metastases. The current proposal will shed further
light on understanding how metastatic MB cells develop and adapt to their neural niche opening avenues for novel
therapeutic interventions for children that have this devastating disease."

Training: The purpose of this K01 proposal is to prepare Dr. Katharine Press Callahan for a career as an
independent physician-scientist focused on the ethical and social implications of genetic testing for critically ill
neonates. Her long-term career objective is to conduct impactful research on the use of genetic testing for
neonates using both quantitative and qualitative methods. To this end, Dr. Callahan and her mentorship team
have devised a career development plan that integrates: (1) intensive mentorship from a team of mentors and
advisors with whom Dr. Callahan has a track record of successful collaboration, (2) advanced training in
genetic science and testing, qualitative methods, and medical simulation, and (3) an innovative research plan
designed to investigate how neonatologists and parents of neonates manage the uncertainty of genetic
information.
Research: Genetic testing is increasingly used in ill neonates and holds promise to improve care. However, in
practice, many genetic results contain substantial uncertainty, which can lead both clinicians and parents to
misunderstand or misapply results, resulting in biased treatment plans. Little is known about how uncertainty
affects neonatologists’ use and communication of genetic information or parents’ understanding of this
information in practice. Dr. Callahan’s mentored, mixed-methods research will fill the critical need to identify
and mediate potential risks that emerge as neonatologists and parents increasingly use uncertain genetic
results in practice. Aim 1 will identify the types of uncertainty that neonatologists and parents perceive when
they receive genetic results and examine how this uncertainty affects understanding and use of results. Aim 2
will assess the effect of uncertainty about prognosis on neonatologists’ counseling about genetic information
and potential disability. Aim 3 will develop and preliminary test an information management tool that aims to
improve understanding and standardize communication of genetic information and associated uncertainty
between geneticists, neonatologists, and parents.
Significance: Completing these aims within the context of a structured career development plan will prepare
Dr. Callahan to be an independent investigator poised to execute the NHGRI vision of integrating complex
genetic information into the clinical workflow in newborn medicine. Findings from this study will inform an R01
proposal to validate and disseminate the genetic information management tool developed in Aim 3."
10907788,"Alcohol misuse is strongly associated with suicide crises (i.e., acute suicidal ideation or attempts) and death.
The standard care for a suicide crisis, including for persons who misuse alcohol, is acute psychiatric
hospitalization. Acute psychiatric hospitalization focuses on stabilization and crisis resolution prior to quickly
discharging at-risk patients back into their stressful environments with a referral for outpatient care. Outpatient-
based interventions focused on emotion regulation training have been shown to simultaneously reduce alcohol
misuse and suicidal behavior. Yet, less than 50% of psychiatric inpatients follow through with outpatient
treatment, which creates a dangerous gap in care; risk for suicide is the highest among recently discharging
patients who misuse alcohol. This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23)
involves the development of a novel adjunctive intervention to (1) enhance standard care for at-risk psychiatric
inpatients who misuse alcohol, and (2) create an opportunity for sustained recovery and reduced risk for a
subsequent suicide crisis during the post-discharge period. This intervention, entitled mHealth-supported Skills
Training for Alcohol and Related Suicidality (mSTARS), combines emotion regulation skills training
implemented in the acute setting with a mHealth app designed to encourage utilization of these skills during
the risky post-discharge period. The research plan for this K23 has two phases: development (Phase 1: AIMS
1 and 2) and evaluation of feasibility and acceptability of mSTARS (Phase 2: AIM 3). To inform mHealth app
development, we will conduct a 6-week ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study on suicidal psychiatric
inpatients who misuse alcohol (N = 35) to elucidate time-varying predictors for alcohol consumption and
suicidal ideation, and examine the role of specific emotion regulation deficits. Analyses will facilitate
adjustments to the app to make empirically-based recommendations for emotion regulation skills in real time
(AIM 1). mSTARS, including the inpatient skills training component and mHealth app, will be iteratively refined
per patient-driven modifications over two successive cohorts (n = 5 in each) of suicidal psychiatric inpatients
who misuse alcohol (AIM 2). The finalized version of mSTARS, while incorporating AIM 1 findings, will be
evaluated in AIM 3 in a three-arm feasibility/acceptability randomized control trial comparing mSTARS (n = 15)
to inpatient skills training (n = 10) and treatment as usual (TAU) only (n = 10). The research plan for this K23 is
closely tied to the PI’s training goals, which are to gain experience with (1) advanced longitudinal modeling of
EMA data, (2) mHealth-supported treatment development, and (3) clinical trials design and management. Over
the 5-year K23 award period, these training goals will facilitate the PI’s overarching career goal of becoming an
independent clinical researcher. Beginning with this K23, the broader aim of the PI’s research program is to
develop integrated, scalable, and cost-effective mHealth-supported interventions to treat concurrent alcohol
misuse and suicidal behavior across treatment settings, reducing risk for this underserved population."
10923958,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Biological systems are presumed to fail over time based on nine “hallmarks of aging,” which somehow cause a
global decline in tissue function and health. Based on this paradigm, interventions, and combinations of them,
are being developed to attenuate each of the hallmarks and slow the aging process. Unfortunately, a lack of
insight into the interdependence among these aging hallmarks has made it difficult to develop universally
effective mitigation strategies. Our lab and others have provided evidence that a loss of stored information
impairs the function of cellular machinery and physical structures, leading to aging and age-related diseases.
We have developed the ICE system (Yang et al. 2022, provisionally accepted by Cell) which allows for spatial
and temporal control over epigenetic aging in mammals. We have also discovered that partial reprogramming
using the reprogramming factors, Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 (OSK), allows cells to retrieve a “backup copy” of youthful
information that resets the epigenome, reverses multiple hallmarks of aging, and restores DNA methylation
patterns to their previous youthful state (Lu et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2022, provisionally accepted by Cell).
In this study, we leverage our ability to control the pace of aging in forward and reverse directions to test the
hypothesis that a loss of interconnectivity between cellular information and cellular machinery and physical
structures is a primary driver of the Hallmarks of Aging and a reversible cause of aging itself. To do this, we will
develop the first set of fluorescent hallmark reporters to monitor hallmark progression and interactions during
aging and discover ways to promote their co-reversal. This novel tool will be utilized along with advanced multi-
omic approaches in novel co-biosis systems and age-programmable mice in the heterogeneous UM-HET3
genetic background.
This study is important because it will provide valuable knowledge concerning the long-standing questions about
interconnectivity among the aging hallmarks, such as whether hierarchies exist and if the reversal of one hallmark
ensures the erasure of others. Together, this work will provide the field with a novel set of customizable tools to
track and study these hallmarks and test the hypothesis that many hallmarks intersect at the informational level
and are therefore co-reversible when information in the nucleus is reset to a youthful state."
10911355,"ABSTRACT: Modulation of Lifespan and Healthspan by Meiosis Genes
 The impact of advanced maternal age on fertility decline is well established, but how germline fitness influ-
ences organismal health and aging remains unclear. It is known that reproductive defects augur detrimental
long-term consequences in both sexes. For instance, early age-at-natural-menopause (ANM) has been linked
to greater risk of mortality. Women with late ANM exhibit younger ‘epigenetic aging’ profiles and brothers of
women with prolonged reproductive longevity show extended lifespan. Menopause itself triggers susceptibility
to a host of comorbidities unrelated to reproduction such as cardiovascular disease and dementia, as does tes-
tosterone decline in men. Thus, a compelling body of clinical and epidemiological evidence indicates that
germline status influences overall organismal health and aging. However, human studies do not address cau-
sality nor reveal the mechanisms by which the immortal germline may influence aging of the mortal somatic
tissues.
 We have utilized the unique strengths of Caenorhabditis elegans to assess how perturbing meiosis, a pro-
cess that occurs exclusively in germ cells, impacts the length of life and rate of aging of the animal. This pro-
posal is based on our discovery that disruption of meiosis accelerates somatic aging. We found that mutations
in C. elegans genes operating at different steps of meiosis shortened lifespan, impaired healthspan and desta-
bilized protein homeostasis. Importantly, meiotic mutants exhibited prematurely aged transcriptional profiles
reminiscent of old C. elegans and aging human tissues, suggesting that germline dysfunction triggers a con-
served molecular-aging signature. Thus, we hypothesize that genes that govern meiotic fidelity in germ cells
influence organismal lifespan and healthspan.
 Our study has revealed a hitherto unknown link between the nuclear events of meiosis in germ cells and
the aging of both the gonadal tissue and the organism. This exploratory study aims to find the missing links in
this pathway: what are the signals between the germ line and soma that lead to organismal aging (Aim 1),
does the meiotic nuclear dysfunction lead to aging of the gonad as well and how is this connected to somatic
aging (Aim 2). Notably, many of the genes we studied have human homologs with roles in mammalian meiosis

meiosis mutants and aging human tissues suggest avenues to unravel potential evolutionarily conserved
mechanisms underpinning the meiotic control of health and longevity. This study will establish the foundation
for future mechanistic- and conservational- studies."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) was the world’s single leading cause of death from infection before COVID-
19. Direct-acting antimycobacterial regimens are long, often toxic and plagued by emergence of drug resistance.
Adjunctive therapies could potentially speed the cure of tuberculosis by targeting a process in the host that alters
the host-pathogen interaction to the advantage of the host. One potential form of host-directed therapy would be
to help macrophages better survive Mtb infection. In vitro, the death of Mtb-infected mouse macrophages is co-
dependent on a type I interferon (IFN), IFN-beta, that macrophages produce in response to Mtb, along with an
additional contribution by Mtb. This application seeks to identify specific molecular participants in Mtb-induced
macrophage death that are downstream of the type I IFN receptor. We have identified potential molecular
participants by two approaches—a CRISPR activation screen that restored Mtb-induced cell death to
macrophages lacking the type I IFN receptor, and an innovative biochemical pulldown approach using a probe
based on a small chemical compound that rescues Mtb-infected macrophages from Mtb-induced cell death
without impairing the growth of Mtb. This application aims to validate the candidates genetically, test the ability
of already existing inhibitors to recapitulate the effect of knocking them out, and then place the validated
candidates on a mechanistic path. That would set the stage for future studies, beyond the scope of this
application, to find, improve or develop drug-like inhibitors for tests in preclinical models of TB to see if they
mitigate pathology and hasten cure when used in combination with direct-acting antimycobacterial agents."
11061153,"Three major thyroid hormone receptor (THR) isoforms, expressed from two genetic loci (Thra and Thrb), are
present in mammals: THRA1, THRB1, and THRB2. Thyroid hormone (TH) acting through THRs regulate food
intake metabolism and the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis in man. Our laboratories have long been
interested in the THRB2 isoform as a central regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, given its
unique and limited-expression pattern. We recently found that THRB2 is heavily phosphorylated by both TH and
AMP kinase (AMPK) at an N-terminal serine site (S101-mouse, S102-human), not found in other THRs. Based
on increased food intake, obesity, and TH resistance in mice carrying a mutation of this phosphorylation
site (S101A), we hypothesize that an AMPK-dependent THRB2 S101 phosphorylation pathway in the
hypothalamus suppresses food intake and the HPT axis. We also hypothesize that dysfunction of this
pathway results in leptin resistance, increased food intake, and obesity (Fig. 1). Three closely related aims
are proposed: Specific Aim 1: Functionally co-localize hypothalamic THRB2 and AMPK action on feeding. Both
the arcuate (ARC) and ventromedial nucleus (VMN) regulate feeding in a THRB- and AMPK-dependent manner.
To begin to functionally localize THRB2 action in the hypothalamus, THRB2 will be removed from the POMC
neurons in the ARC and SF-1 neurons in the VMN using Thrb2 floxed mice and cell-specific Cre drivers. Cell-
specific KO of AMPKa2 in the same neurons will also be performed to understand AMPKa2’s role in feeding and
in the p-THRB2 pathway. Both male and female mice will be studied, given higher THRB2 expression in female
HA-tagged THRB2 mice. Specific Aim 2: Determine the role of THRB2 phosphorylation in feeding and mediating
hypothalamic leptin signaling. Previous studies have clearly demonstrated that leptin regulates both the HPT
axis and feeding. A potential mediator of leptin action is p-THRB2, given that S101A mice demonstrate leptin
resistance. A phospho-specific antibody was developed to probe this pathway further and will be used in a time-
course study of THRB2 phosphorylation during the fed-fasting transition. Furthermore, a phosphomimetic
S101D KI mouse model was generated to determine if this change protects against diet-induced obesity. Specific
Aim 3: Define the locus of TRH regulation by THRB2 during fasting. While fasting-induced suppression of the
HPT axis is mediated by reduced TRH expression in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), it remains unknown how
HPT axis suppression is maintained in the setting of low TH levels. Strikingly, S101A mice display resistance to
fasting-induced TRH suppression, suggesting that THRB2 S101 phosphorylation is critical in the sensing of low
TH levels. This aim will determine the locus of fasting-induced and TH-dependent TRH suppression by targeting
neurons in the ARC and PVN. The mechanism of suppression will be explored further by studying if THRB2
phosphorylation is a common mechanism regulating the HPT axis and food intake."
10931464,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We propose to develop fully autonomous “self-driving laboratories” to rapidly engineer enzymes for broad
applications in biomedicine and biocatalysis. Our approach mimics the methodology of a protein engineering
researcher with an AI layer that builds an understanding of protein sequence-structure-function and plans
experiments to test specific protein design hypotheses, and a robotic system that experimentally tests
designed proteins by synthesizing genes, expressing proteins, and performing biochemical measurements of
enzyme activity. Seamless integration between the intelligent agent and experimental automation enables fully
autonomous design-test-learn cycles to understand and optimize the sequence-function landscape. Self-
driving laboratories will revolutionize the fields of biomolecular engineering and synthetic biology by automating
highly inefficient, time consuming, and laborious protein engineering campaigns, enabling rapid turnaround,
and allowing researchers to focus efforts on important downstream applications."
10877951,"ABSTRACT
An unmet need for psychiatric neuroimaging is a standard developmental frame of reference to benchmark
studies of neurodevelopmental conditions such as schizophrenia the psychosis spectrum (PS). Using a
modelling approach that has proven successful for non-imaging growth charts in clinical pediatrics, and in our
preliminary work that was focused on a limited set of global brain MRI features, we propose to leverage data
from our multi-site Brain Chart Consortium to produce computational charts of brain maturation for a far richer
set of brain morphological features across anatomical scales. Our Consortium aims to be the largest and most
inclusive possible, with preliminary data covering the entire lifespan, over 130,000 MRI scans, over 100,000
individuals and over 300 MR scanners. Using advanced, fully-reproducible pipelines for quality control, image
processing and harmonization, multi-scale brain charts will define normative trends and milestones of growth
which can be used to benchmark a new individual brain scan, or group of scans, while controlling for study-
specific technical confounds. We will create and maintain an open resource to disseminate these charts for use
by other researchers. We will use brain charts to identify clusters of developmental imaging phenotypes – brain
profiles benchmarked by growth chart norms – with similarly-shaped maturational trajectories. Longitudinal
analysis of twin datasets will specifically delineate heritable brain profiles, which we hypothesize will show
genotype-by-age effects organized along the sensory-to-association (SA) axis of cortical maturation, in
developmental epochs where risk for PS is hypothesized to emerge (Aim 1). We will perform genome- and
transcriptome-wide association studies to identify brain profiles that are influenced by functionally active
genetic variants associated with risk for PS (Aim 2). We will perform brain profile subtyping of individuals with
PS diagnoses in our Consortium case-control studies (over 2000 MRIs), to characterize a PS subtype where
deviations are most prominent along the SA axis in association cortices that undergo prolonged maturation
through adolescence. Any individual’s chart-benchmarked brain profile, in a new study, can thus be
characterized with a loading score that quantifies similarity to this PS subtype, and we will evaluate the
association of the PS subtype loading score with the evolution of PS symptoms across multiple longitudinal
follow-up studies of PS conducted at the University of Pennsylvania (over 2200 longitudinal MRIs, 800
participants, 450 with PS, age 8-35) that will be pooled and harmonized for this proposal (Aim 3). This
proposal’s overarching goal is to create a practically useful brain chart resource and to demonstrate its
transformative potential for studies of brain development in PS. This work capitalizes on the PI and assembled
team’s expertise in psychiatric and developmental brain imaging, imaging-genetics and neuroinformatics.
Cumulatively, the proposed research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of typical brain
development and altered neurodevelopment in PS."
10896223,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Impoverished social relationships are major contributors to morbidity and mortality, rivaling the effects of
established risk factors such as cigarette smoking and obesity. Both social isolation (the lack of social contact)
and loneliness (the perception of being alone) have been linked with cognitive morbidity and risk of Alzheimer's
and related dementias (ADRD) in older adults, but the relative contribution of loneliness and social isolation to
cognitive outcomes remain poorly understood. Similarly, the extent to which the discordance between social
isolation and loneliness accumulates across the adult life span, from midlife to old age, and whether this
relates to cognitive morbidity, decline, and dementia risk in older adults is unknown. Of particular interest is the
extent to which older adults' vulnerability to isolation and loneliness is amplified amid physical distancing
measures introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the long-terms impacts this may have on
cognitive health. This proposal will investigate the hypothesis that changes in the degree of overlap or
discordance between subjective feelings of loneliness and objective social network size (social asymmetry)
contribute to cognitive function, decline, and dementia risk, and intensify older adults' cognitive vulnerability
during COVID-19. To achieve the goals of the project, we will capitalize on existing large-scale longitudinal
studies that have collected a broad array of psychosocial and cognitive factors, including repeated
assessments of social isolation, loneliness, and established indicators of cognitive functioning (e.g., numeric
and abstract reasoning, fluency, speed of processing and reaction time, working and episodic memory). The
proposed project will use a coordinated integrative data analysis (IDA) approach to investigate whether
changes in social asymmetry predict cognitive outcomes across eleven representative, prospective,
longitudinal cohort studies of aging (BHPS/US, ELSA, HILDA, HRS, LISS, Octo-Twin, SATSA, SHARE, SHP,
SOEP, and UCL COVID-19 Social Study) with a combined N of over 220,000). The central hypothesis of this
proposal is that susceptibility to loneliness may be characterized by the discrepancy between objective and
subjective aspects of social relationships which 1) is evident across middle and later adulthood; 2) contributes
to cognitive decline in old age; and 3) exacerbates cognitive vulnerability in the context of the COVID-19
pandemic. The findings from this study will provide novel insights into the interplay between social isolation and
loneliness over time, as well as how dynamic patterns of social asymmetry are linked to diverse cognitive
outcomes in older adults. Better understanding of the role of social disparities in cognitive aging may lead to
evidence-based strategies for addressing social isolation and loneliness in older adults, identification of
modifiable social factors that may prevent or slow the progression of cognitive decline in old age, and novel
approaches for understanding the impact of prolong social distancing on the health of older adults."

 Psychosocial stress contributes to cardiovascular disease at several stages, including promoting
coronary artery disease progression and acutely triggering cardiac events1,2. In this project, we aim to investigate
both acute and chronic stress exposure and their immediate and long-term effects on the immune system and
atherosclerosis. We will approach these important questions through the development and application of non-
invasive imaging methods.
 Stress activates diverse signaling circuits in the brain, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), which subsequently affect leukocyte distribution and function
as well as atherosclerotic plaque inflammation. Specifically, HPA axis activation during acute stress controls
lymphocyte and monocyte homing to the bone marrow, while neutrophils are rapidly mobilized from the bone
marrow due to motor cortex signaling3. In parallel, SNS activation leads to the production of catecholamines,
which induce a long-lasting pro-inflammatory phenotype in monocytes based on metabolic and epigenetic
rewiring4,5. SNS activation due to stress has also been directly linked to enhanced atherosclerotic plaque
inflammation6,7. During chronic stress exposure, direct sympathetic signaling enhances the proliferation of
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in the bone marrow (hematopoiesis), leading to higher
numbers of circulating pro-inflammatory neutrophils and monocytes6,8. These cells subsequently extravasate
into the arterial wall and enhance plaque inflammation.
 We hypothesize that stress exposure induces long-term effects on the immune system through the
induction of trained immunity and changes in myeloid cell dynamics. In this highly innovative project, we will
employ newly developed and established PET imaging methods to probe stress’s effects on the immune
system and atherosclerotic plaque inflammation longitudinally, in vivo, and at a whole-body level. In Aim 1, we
will focus on metabolic and epigenetic rewiring in hematopoietic organs over the course of stress exposure and
after stress withdrawal. Aim 2 evolves around stress-induced alterations in myeloid cell dynamics (cell
proliferation, migration, egress, and myeloid cell burden), probed by sophisticated imaging methods.
 Completing these Aims will help decipher stress’s immediate and long-term impact on the immune
system though unique integration of molecular biology and immunology with state-of-the-art translational
cardiovascular imaging research."

Neuropsychiatric disorders are the single greatest cause of disability due to non-communicable disease
worldwide, accounting for 14% of the global burden of disease. The current standards of care suffer from
subjectivity, inconsistent delivery, and limited access with growing waitlists. Data science solutions, in particular
artificial intelligence (AI) that can port to more ubiquitous mobile tools and that are not restricted for use in clinical
settings, have great potential to complement or even replace aspects of the standards of care. We propose to
develop a novel data science solution for one of the most pressing mental health burdens, autism, which is up
in prevalence by more than 200% since 1990, among the fastest growing pediatric concerns today, and highly
representative of many other mental health conditions. We have invented a prototype mobile system called
Guess What (GW) that noninvasively turns the focus of the camera on the child through a fluid social
engagement with his/her social partner in a way that reinforces prosocial learning while simultaneously
measuring the child’s developmental learning progress. At its simplest level, the GW app engages and
challenges the child to imitate social and emotion-centric prompts shown on the screen of a smartphone held
just above the eyes of the individual with whom the child is playing. Preliminary work to-date resulted in positive
user feedback, evidence of high engagement for both the parents and children, and meaningful gains in
socialization in the child. A single session produces 90 seconds of enriched social video and sensor data,
opening up an exciting opportunity for the game play to passively generate labeled training libraries that enable
the development of novel models that are extremely difficult to build without sufficient amounts of domain-
relevant training data. Our grant plan will explore this opportunity by designing and optimizing game modes,
creating a reusable active learning framework for growth of domain-relevant training libraries, and by creating at
least 3 “autism-feature-aware” neural networks that detect child emotion, eye gaze, and hand gestures. Our
project will show that GW can not only gamify crowdsourced construction of novel AI models that automatically
classify important features of child development – providing a way to address many challenges with AI in
medicine today -- but that it can also serve as a mobile therapy for repeat use to target core autism deficits while
also tracking progress at the same time."
10841632,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Understanding how intracellular pathogens survive in their host cells has led to better management/pre-
vention of their diseases, as well as discovery of fundamental biology. In this application, we aim to start
elucidating the strategies and mechanisms used by one of the commonest fungal pathogens, Cryptococcus
neoformans, to survive inside macrophages. The treatment of cryptococcal disease is subpar, resulting in mor-
talities that range from 20% to almost 90%, depending on the geographical region. The ability of this fungus to
survive inside host cells is one of the main drivers of disease progression, and clinical studies show that intra-
cellular survival in macrophages correlates with patient’s mortality. However, the molecular mechanisms that
govern internalization and the ability to survive intracellularly are not known, hampering the development of more
effective therapeutics. Our long-term goal is to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind intra-
cellular survival, a significant gap in knowledge in the field. Moving towards that goal, the objectives of this
application are to define and characterize the cryptococcal-containing phagosome (CCP) in macrophages, and
understand the role of host and fungal factors in the generation of this intracellular niche. We hypothesize that
Cryptococcus actively targets Rab GTPases and phosphoinositides to delay the normal maturation of its phag-
osome. This allows fungal factors, such as capsular hyaluronic acid and glucuronic acid, to modulate acidification
of the CCP, resulting in a fungal permissive niche. Pro-inflammatory signals, mediated in part by Rab20 effects
on phagosomal maturation, counter this fungal manipulation and prevent niche establishment. We plan to test
this hypothesis by (1) defining and characterizing the intracellular niche of C. neoformans in naïve and activated
macrophages; and (2) identify and explore the role of fungal factors in niche establishment. If completed, we will
have identified the genetic (fungal genes), phenotypic (CCP properties) and immunological (host’s immune sta-
tus) characteristics that enable Cryptococcus to live intracellularly, allowing us to pinpoint potential areas of
intervention to block intracellular replication. Completion of these aims will have a positive impact in the field by
generating a detailed molecular description of the strategies Cryptococcus uses to survive in macrophages and
how host cells respond. Moreover, given the scarcity of well characterized intracellular survival strategies in
fungi, the knowledge created here will impact the understanding and studies of other pathogenic fungi as well."
10886134,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hawaii leads the nation in reported cases of human angiostrongyliasis, or rat lungworm (RLW) disease, a
potentially lethal central nervous system infection caused by the parasitic nematode Angiostrongylus
cantonensis. Anthelmintics specifically targeting A. cantonensis are not available. Thus, an urgent need
exists to develop effective drugs for this emerging and neglected tropical disease. Natural products are the
best source of drug leads for parasitic diseases, as previously demonstrated for parasitic diseases, such
as artemisinin for malaria, Ivermectin for river blindness and lymphatic filariasis. Our long-term goal is to
identify novel anthelmintic natural products from microorganisms including under-explored Hawaiian fungi
and bacteria. The objective of the proposed research is to discover natural products that immobilize
infectious third stage A. cantonensis larvae (L3). Our central hypothesis is that natural products such as
the under-explored endophytic fungi in Hawaii and other microorganisms are a rich source for anti-A.
cantonensis natural product drug discovery. The rationale of the proposed research is that once novel
potent anti-RLW natural products are identified, lead compounds will be studied for their mechanisms of
action and tested in vivo in the near future. The objectives of this project will be accomplished by two
specific aims: (1) Screen NPs against infectious A. cantonensis L3; (2) Identify and characterize motility
inhibiting and viability reducing bioactive NPs via assay-guided separation and structure elucidation, and
assess Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and efficacy. This study is innovative because it: (a) uses
our newly established high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to screen our new and unique natural
product library (NPL) against RLW; and (b) utilizes a new infrared-based motility-inhibition bioassay to
screen fractions from our NPL against infectious L3 larvae. The proposed project is significant because it
aims to reduce human suffering from emerging infectious diseases through the development of effective
therapeutics, and will strengthen the research infrastructure for natural product drug discovery and
molecular medicine in Hawaii. Our approach could serve as a model for carrying out natural product drug
discovery against other newly emerging parasitic diseases. This project will also provide research
experience opportunities for graduate students and ethnically diverse and socioeconomically
disadvantaged undergraduate students in the state of Hawaii."

 Viral myocarditis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in children and
young adults. Despite the clinical importance of viral myocarditis, the mechanisms by which viruses cause
myocarditis are poorly understood. The overall objective of experiments described in this application is to define
viral and host determinants that contribute to the development of viral myocarditis. Work proposed in this
application uses mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus), which is a longstanding model for studying viral cardiac
infections in neonates. We recently identified a potently myocarditic reovirus strain (T1L/T3DM2) that is highly
lethal in neonatal mice. Our preliminary data indicate that the virulence of T1L/T3DM2 is markedly diminished
in mice lacking key components of pyroptotic cell death pathway. In this application, we will explore how
pyroptosis potentiates reovirus myocarditis. Experiments in Specific Aim 1 will define the role of pyroptosis in
the heart during reovirus infection. Experiments in Specific Aim 2 will define mechanism by which reovirus
induces pyroptosis using a combination in vivo infections in combination with primary cardiomyocytes. This
research will have broad general impact by uncovering broad principles that govern immune mechanisms that
contribute to viral cardiac disease."
10863885,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Opioid use disorder (OUD) is an escalating public health concern, and has resulted in over 550,000 overdose
deaths between 1999 and 2020. Specifically, initial exposure to prescription opioids, such as oxycodone
(OXY), has contributed to an average of 13,850 deaths annually since 2018 (Centers for Disease Control).
While many individuals are able to use opioids as prescribed, a subset of individuals transition to compulsive
drug use, which is defined as continued drug intake despite negative consequences, and is a hallmark feature
of OUD. Similarly, most rodents will readily self-administer opioids, but will suppress their drug consumption
when drug intake is paired with punishment such as foot shock (punishment-sensitive); while ~20-25% will
persist in drug intake despite this punishment (punishment-resistant). Elucidating the neural mechanisms
underlying individual differences in punishment-resistant drug seeking will be critical for
understanding susceptibility to and treatment strategies for compulsive drug use. The ventral pallidum
(VP) has emerged as a critical brain area for encoding the relative value and motivation for rewards and
translating this motivation into reward seeking. The VP is a heterogeneous nucleus, with different populations
playing opposing roles in appetitive behavior. Specifically, we and others have established that glutamatergic
VP neurons (VPGlu) are crucial for constraining reward seeking in the face of aversive consequences, by
modulating activity of downstream brain areas involved in punishment learning, including the lateral habenula
(LHb) and rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg). The objective of this proposal is to establish whether OXY-
SA decreases the excitability, in vivo activity and synaptic output of VPGlu neurons, and determine if these
adaptations are causally related to punishment-resistant OXY intake. Using complementary approaches of
electrophysiology, calcium detection with fiber photometry and chemogenetic manipulations, we will establish
whether OXY self-administration decreases excitability of VPGlu neurons, and whether this reduced activity is
necessary and sufficient for the emergence of punishment-resistant OXY intake (Aim 1). We will next use
electrophysiology and bidirectional optogenetic manipulations to determine whether reduced synaptic output
from VPGlu neurons to the LHb or RMTg is causally related to punishment-resistant OXY intake (Aim 2).
Finally, we will sequence actively translated mRNA from VPGlu neurons to determine gene networks that confer
risk and protection against punishment-resistant OXY intake (Aim 3). This will also allow us to identify and
validate potential pharmacological targets that could modulate VPGlu neuron activity in vivo as a therapeutic
strategy. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the neural circuit basis of punishment-resistant opioid intake, and
to leverage this understanding to develop neuromodulation therapies (such as deep brain stimulation with
targeted pharmacology) to treat persistent drug intake despite negative consequences in patients with OUD."
10877188,"Heterotypic interactions between amyloid proteins are critical in understanding the outcomes of amyloid-based
infection and treatment; however, the molecular and structural determinants that allow or limit amyloid cross-
seeding have been difficult to define. Towards this goal, it will be informative to identify amyloid interactions on
a larger scale, generating a knowledgebase that can contribute to the identification of rules governing cross-
seeding among amyloids. The adhesins are an important family of functional amyloids central to fungal biology
and virulence. Adhesins are cell wall-attached proteins that mediate cell-cell adhesion in fungal filamentous
growth and biofilm formation. Notably, nearly 90% of adhesins are predicted functional amyloids, and many
have been demonstrated to possess core sequences capable of forming amyloid fibrils in solution. In the
yeasts S. cerevisiae and C. albicans, adhesins aggregate to form cell surface nanodomain patches important
in the enhanced cell-cell adhesion of pseudohyphal and hyphal filaments. The ability to transition between
yeast-like and filamentous growth forms is required for virulence in the opportunistic human fungal pathogen C.
albicans, and adhesins have been identified as virulence factors. Adhesin sequences with strong
amyloidogenic potential are required for wild-type cell-cell adhesion and filamentation. Fungi preferentially bind
to like cells in biofilms and filamentous communities. Since this binding is mediated through adhesins, we
hypothesize that specificity in amyloid interactions underlies kin discrimination and cellular self-recognition in
yeast. Our preliminary data are consistent with this hypothesis, identifying important sequence variation in
amyloidogenic regions of the well-studied adhesin Flo11p between filamentous and non-filamentous strains of
S. cerevisiae. We also identify that single amino acid changes in amyloid proteins can strongly affect cross-
seeding specificity. Here, we propose to test adhesin protein isoforms of Flo11p from filamentous and non-
filamentous strains of S. cerevisiae for cross-seeding. Species barriers to adhesin interactions will be tested
using the set of identified adhesins from S. cerevisiae and C. albicans. The adhesins present an informative
platform for the investigation of amyloid interaction specificity, and a genome-wide set of yeast functional
amyloids will be tested for amyloidogenic potential and heterotypic interactions using the adhesin framework as
a novel screening scaffold. Collectively, this work will determine the specificity and barriers that constrain
heterotypic adhesin interactions in yeast, while offering broader insight into the rules of amyloid cross-seeding.
Using the adhesins as a scaffold for yeast surface display, we present a method amenable to high throughput
applications for the identification of new amyloids and the rapid assessment of specific aggregation barriers.
Adhesins are fungal-specific virulence determinants relevant as targets for new antifungal treatments."

10753448,"Project Summary 
The R00 phase of this project will be conducted at the University of California, Irvine in the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, School of Biological Sciences. Sleep is crucial for memory consolidation and its benefit is most commonly thought to occur via the reactivation of memories, thereby strengthening the neural infrastructure supporting them. Theoretical accounts of sleep-related consolidation focus on the process by which memories are independently strengthened, but in natural settings individual memories never exist in a vacuum. Importantly, the context in which memories are embedded during encoding governs retrieval and decision making behavior. However, context’s role in consolidation has not been directly explored. The goal of the proposed project is to improve our fundamental understanding of memory processes by developing an empirically-based framework unifying models of context’s effect on memory and models of sleep-related consolidation (Aim 1). Additionally, the framework will be used to support translational interventions to alter memories during sleep. Aim 2 will attempt to reinstate a suppression context during sleep to effectively weaken memories. This effort will inform future work on alleviating memory-related symptoms in clinical populations suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.
This project will combine novel techniques to selectively bias memory reactivation; machine-learning algorithms to decipher memory-related content from neural data; and neuroscientific methods for monitoring brain connectivity and rhythms in different regions and timescales. For Aim 1, functional MRI pattern analysis techniques will be used to reveal whether contexts, individual memories or both are reactivated during natural, undisturbed sleep. For Aim 2, the main behavioral manipulation used will be targeted memory reactivation, the unobtrusive presentation of learning-related stimuli during sleep, thereby enhancing memory. In one experiment included in Aim 2, individual memories will be embedded in a previously unrelated context during sleep: a reactivated “suppression” context (cued by an odor) will be presented with auditory cues linked to individual memories, hypothetically weakening them during sleep. An additional experiment will use a similar technique to try and alleviate distressful intrusive memories following a trauma manipulation in healthy participants. Taken together, these experiments should pave the way towards a richer understanding of the extent of memory reactivation during sleep, and toward content-specific interventions to selectively manipulate sleep, thereby improving mental health and wellbeing."

Hyperkalemia is a common and potentially life-threatening electrolyte disturbance. The risk of hyperkalemia is
higher in individuals with heart failure (HF) and chronic kidney disease and with the use of certain medications,
such as spironolactone. Current methods to identify individuals at increased risk of hyperkalemia are
rudimentary. Potassium is primarily eliminated by the kidneys through glomerular filtration and tubular
secretion, but currently only glomerular filtration is considered when evaluating risk for hyperkalemia. Novel
biomarkers of kidney tubular secretion have been strongly linked with tubule fibrosis and we have recently
demonstrated that a lower secretion score, a composite score from secretion biomarkers, is associated with a
higher risk of incident hyperkalemia. Many medications, such as spironolactone, are eliminated through
secretion. Kidney tubule secretion biomarkers have been associated with the clearance of medications
dependent on kidney secretion for elimination. The Spironolactone for Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection
Fraction (TOPCAT) trial is a multicenter international clinical trial that enrolled 3445 patients with HFpEF and
randomized participants to spironolactone versus placebo. In TOPCAT, rates of hyperkalemia were 18.7% in
spironolactone arm and 9.1% in the placebo arm. In this TOPCAT ancillary study, we will measure kidney
tubule secretion biomarkers with the specific aims to: 1) determine if a novel panel of tubular secretion
biomarkers identifies HF patients at higher risk for hyperkalemia in TOPCAT, and 2) determine if tubule
secretion biomarkers are associated with improvements in heart failure symptoms and natriuretic peptide
levels from spironolactone therapy among HF patients in TOPCAT. The results of this study will provide
evidence for an innovative method to risk stratify individuals for risk of hyperkalemia prior to starting
hyperkalemia provoking medications, and lead to a new line of investigation wherein we move secretion
biomarkers from research towards clinical practice with the ultimate goal of maximizing benefits while
minimizing risks of drug dosing and drug-drug interactions for secreted drugs."
10916421,"Arsenicals cause rapid, severe and painful inflammatory and blistering responses in the skin. The available
medical countermeasures against arsenical-induced toxicity are not effective due to toxicity and a low therapeutic
index. Hence, there is a demand for the development of more effective and less toxic antidotes for arsenicals.
Developing hybrid inhibitors of bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) which are responsible for the
regulation of inflammatory genes, receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIP3, or RIPK3), a central player in
necroptosis, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) would be an effective and efficient treatment to attenuate arsenical-induced
inflammation. We have identified three potent inhibitors, SRI-43887, SRI-47362 and SRI-47561 of BRD4, RIPK3
and IL6. For example, SRI-43887 exhibited significant activity in vivo against phenylarsine oxide (PAO) and
arsenicals (Lewisite)-induced mice. Continued optimization of these compounds will lead to the identification of
a potential preclinical candidate(s) for the treatment of cutaneous injuries associated with arsenicals. To achieve
this goal, we will (i) utilize molecular modeling to design and synthesize analogs of these three lead compounds
and test in vitro for BRD4, RIPK3 and IL6 inhibitory activity; (ii) evaluate select compounds for cytotoxicity and
in vitro drug-like properties (solubility, metabolic stability, log D, permeability); (iii) determine the in vivo
pharmacokinetic profile (bioavailability and half-life); and (iv) perform in vivo studies on select compounds against
PAO and Lewisite to determine the efficacy of these compounds. These goals will be accomplished through a
collaborative effort involving a team with extensive experience in drug design, medicinal chemistry,

cases of hepatitis and >44,000 deaths due to hepatobiliary diseases. As a non-enveloped virus, HEV is surprisingly present
as quasi-enveloped exosome-like virions in circulating blood that resist neutralization. Genotype 1 HEV (HEV-1) infection
is associated with fulminant hepatitis with high mortality (>25%) in pregnant women. HEV-1 replicates in placental tissues,
and HEV-1 vertical transmission is associated with a high neonatal mortality. Due to the lack of an efficient cell culture or
animal model for HEV-1, the mechanism of HEV-1-associated severe diseases during pregnancy is unknown. Significantly
higher levels of TNF-α were found in HEV-infected pregnant women with fulminant hepatitis, and HEV-infected pigs with
detectable HEV RNA in CNS tissues had significantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-18) than
in pigs without detectable HEV RNA in CNS tissues. The long-term goal is to delineate the mechanisms contributing to
HEV-associated high mortality during pregnancy. Unfortunately, we currently do not have a suitable system, in vitro or in
vivo, to study HEV-1 infection at the maternal-fetal interface. In aim 1, we will establish an in vitro placental barrier in
Transwell insert to study HEV-1 infection in the maternal-fetal interface. We hypothesize that HEV-1 in circulating blood
during peak viremia crosses the placental barrier leading to fetal infection. We will develop a placental barrier culture
mimicking the critical maternal blood- and fetal blood-facing layers that constitute the human placental barrier in vivo, by
co-culturing BeWo placental trophoblastic cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells on basolateral and apical sides
of an extracellular matrix-coated Transwell insert. The integrity of the barrier will be confirmed by measuring TEER and
barrier permeability to small molecules. We will determine whether HEV-1 can cross the barrier by infecting barrier cultures
in the maternal chamber with HEV-1 and HEV-3, respectively, and measuring the amount of HEV in the fetal chamber of
the barrier. In aim 2, we will determine the mechanisms of HEV-1 infection in the maternal-fetal interface leading to fetal
infection. We hypothesize that quasi-enveloped exosome-like HEVs in circulating maternal blood during peak viremia
more easily cross the placental barrier when the barrier is inflamed by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-
18 that are consistently produced during HEV infection, and that HEV-1 infection in the barrier produces type III IFNs to
limit viral infection. We will inflame the barrier cultures with TNF-α and IL-18, separately or in combination, and then
infect them with non-enveloped HEV-1, HEV-3, quasi-enveloped HEV-1, HEV-3, respectively, to determine the amounts
of HEV that have crossed the barrier. We will also determine the expression levels of IFN-α, IFN-β and IFN-λs in infected
cells, and determine if the antiviral resistance environment induced at the barrier can be transferred to HEV-susceptible liver
cells. We anticipate to establish a placental barrier mimicking the critical maternal blood- and fetal blood-facing layers in
vivo, and show that quasi-enveloped HEV-1 will more easily cross the barrier especially when the barrier is inflamed with
proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-18. We also expect that HEV-1 induces IFN-λ1/λ2/λ3 in the barrier to limit virus
replication, and that the antiviral resistance environment induced at the barrier is transferable to HEV-susceptible liver cells."
10877911,"Our overarching goal is to develop efficacious strategies to combat multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, a
growing healthcare threat. Quorum sensing (QS) inhibition is an attractive anti-microbial approach, as it
represents an anti-virulence strategy fundamentally different from current traditional therapies. QS a highly
conserved bacterial communication signaling regulatory mechanism controlling numerous virulence functions
and inter- and intraspecies interactions in mono- and polymicrobial communities. The recalcitrant ESKAPE
pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) exemplifies a highly problematic nosocomial pathogen with astounding
complex interconnected QS systems controlling multiple virulence functions and regulating antagonism or
synergism with other microbes. QS relevance in pathogenesis has been recognized; however, the regulatory
interrelationships of these systems during infection and in polymicrobial settings have been studied primarily in
vitro, limiting relevance to the human environment during infection and leaving answered fundamental questions
that will aid in combatting MDR infections by utilizing the anti-virulence/anti-QS approach.
 We hypothesize that the interrelationships between the three QS systems are significant drivers of
infection severity, interspecies interactions, and microbial community composition. In turn, we anticipate that our
anti-QS lead compound will restrict infection exacerbations and promote microbial homeostasis.
 We propose to assess this hypothesis paradigmatically by leveraging an extensive collection of PA QS
mutants and a novel anti-QS compound in dynamic and human-relevant host environments to identify
specific infection-relevant host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions and dissect the mechanisms
underlying these interactions. Specifically, in the proposed three Aims, we will address three fundamental
questions that will fill existing gaps: 1) What are the regulatory relationships and functions of the three major PA
QS systems? 2) How do anti-QS therapies impact infection severity and QS regulatory interactions in PA mono-
and polymicrobial settings? and 3) How do the QS systems and inhibitors impact the development of resistance
and limit perturbations of host-associated microbial communities? Answering these questions will not only
provide critical insights into long-standing questions about the anti-virulence approach and the role of QS
mutations in PA virulence but will also uncover how the in vivo environment impacts the regulatory
interrelationships of the three QS systems and QS-dependent inter- and intraspecies interactions.
 By tapping into bacterial QS pathways with novel potent and highly specific anti-QS compounds, we aim
to treat infections while preserving the composition and protective function of the microbiota. Results from these
dynamic settings may aid in the fight against antibiotic resistance and provide fundamental insights into the
molecular mechanisms underlying the virulence of complex infections and microbial interactions in vivo."

 Women with germline mutations of BRCA1 have about an 80% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. All
somatic cells in a germline BRCA1 mutation carrier harbor the same mutant copy of the BRCA1 gene, yet BRCA1
research is almost exclusively focused on BRCA1’s role in repair of double-strand DNA breaks in the breast
epithelium. This is due to the cardinal tenet of the current BRCA1 paradigm — increased genetic instability of
the breast epithelium solely drives development of BRCA1 mutation-related breast cancer. In addition, current
prophylactic risk-reducing surgeries are aimed at curtailing tumorigenesis of breast epithelial cells of BRCA1
mutation carriers. In contrast, virtually nothing is known about whether BRCA1 heterozygosity in cells beyond
the breast epithelium could also contribute to BRCA1-related tumorigenesis.
 Neoplasia is antagonized by the ability of the immune system to detect and eliminate neoplastic cells. Clearly,
impaired antitumor immunity enables immune evasion and tumor outgrowth. We recently found that women with
BRCA1 germline mutations have less abundant circulating CD8+ T cells versus age-matched donors with wild-
type BRCA1 genes. In support of this clinical finding, heterozygous knockout of Brca1 specifically in CD8+ T cells
of mice is sufficient to attenuate antitumor immunity. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that T cell-
intrinsic function of BRCA1 in enhancing antitumor immunity contributes to the overall tumor
suppressor activity of BRCA1. We further propose that in BRCA1 mutation carriers, increased genomic
instability in the breast epithelium and attenuated antitumor immunity in CD8+ T cells act together to elevate
cancer incidence. To validate this novel hypothesis, we will combine our established team’s tools and expertise
in cancer biology, tumor immunology, and transcriptional regulation through the following three Specific Aims:
(1) Discern the impact of T cell-intrinsic BRCA1 on antitumor immunity and immunotherapy, (2) Elucidate the
molecular basis for BRCA1’s function in antitumor immunity, and (3) Examine BRCA1 mutation-related T cell
deficiency in human samples.
 Our proposed work represents a new direction in elucidating a previously unappreciated tumor-suppressing
function of BRCA1 in immune cells. The concept to be validated clearly departs from the prevailing paradigm
regarding BRCA1-related cancer etiology, which is focused on the breast epithelium and DNA repair. From a
translational perspective, our proposed study focusing on BRCA1 in immune cells will likely inform development
of novel immune-boosting strategies for women with BRCA1 germline mutations. Thus, this line of work has
potential for far-reaching and sustained impact on breast cancer cancer risk reduction."
10851011,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although T cell mediated immune responses are critical for the success of immunotherapy, those T cells
associated with malignant lesions are typically dysfunctional and fail to control tumor growth. Treatment with
tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) that are isolated, activated, and expanded ex vivo has proven very effective
in some patient populations of melanoma. However, a substantial number of patients do not respond,
presumably due to one of a number of host immune factors. Current understanding of TIL mechanism of action
suggests that both an early robust expansion of tumor-specific effector T cells and transfer of less differentiated
cells with long-term survival capacity are key to a successful therapy. Evidence for the former includes the need
for high dose exogenous IL-2 at the time of TIL infusion, the correlation of response with a high frequency of
effector T cells, and the majority of tumor killing occurring very early after the initiation of therapy. Evidence for
the latter is found in many pre-clinical experiments as well as clinical observations where the presence of TILs
from the central memory subset in the infusion product correlates with tumor regression. Our overall goal is to
improve TIL therapeutic efficacy through the generation of TIL products with both the transient ability to effectively
immediately kill tumor cells as well as the long-term ability to persist and maintain durable anti-tumor responses.
To address these challenges we have developed robust methods to reprogram TILs with mRNA-mediated gene
therapy. The use of our mRNA approach has the advantages of increased safety, high efficiency, rapid
production, tightly controlled expression levels and simultaneous multi-factor reprogramming. In preliminary
work we have developed a system that increases mRNA lifespan by an order of magnitude. Our single cell
analysis of patient TILs pre- and post-expansion has identified two specific pathways deficient in the expanded
TIL product that likely contribute to their poor immediate efficacy and absence of memory fate. Both of these
will be augmented by TIL mRNA reprogramming. In Aim 1 we will develop a method to enhance post-expansion
TIL survival, while in Aim 2 we will improve the production of central memory TILs. We will evaluate the effect
of these improvements in TIL production using paired tumor/TIL sets derived from the melanomas from multiple
patients by studying tumor-mediated TIL activation and tumor lysis in vitro and in pre-clinical humanized mouse
models using single cell analysis and advanced spatial transcriptomics. This application addresses the need to
improve response rates to adoptive cell immunotherapies for melanoma and is designed to be translatable to
clinical trials in the near future."

The goal of this P01 program is to define mechanisms of efficacy of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) and
therapeutic vaccines for HIV-1 in a highly collaborative and multifaceted research program. Our overall
hypothesis is that immunologic strategies for HIV-1 cure delay viral rebound both by targeting the viral
reservoir and by increasing host antiviral immunity. We will evaluate mechanisms of therapeutic efficacy in
both humans and nonhuman primates (NHPs) using coordinated virologic, immunologic, and multi-omic
approaches with the goal of developing improved next generation HIV-1 cure strategies. We will apply cutting-
edge, high-throughput, multi-omic profiling platforms and integrate these data sets to generate a comprehensive
tissue landscape and regulatory network of the viral reservoir and host immune responses.
This program builds on our existing studies over the past several years in both humans and NHPs evaluating
the ability of bNAbs and therapeutic vaccines to delay viral rebound following discontinuation of antiretroviral
therapy (ART). We will first utilize existing samples from these studies to generate hypotheses regarding
correlates of delayed viral rebound. We will then perform new interventional studies in NHPs with spatial multi-
omic analyses in lymph nodes and gastrointestinal mucosal tissues to test hypotheses in order to define
mechanisms of reservoir targeting by bNAbs and therapeutic vaccines.
The significance of this program is the potential to define the biologic pathways that lead to delayed viral rebound
following ART discontinuation. An improved understanding of partially effective bNAbs and therapeutic vaccines
in humans and NHPs will lead to basic research advances that will allow the development of improved next
generation HIV-1 cure approaches. To accomplish the goals of this P01 program, we propose the following

The human gut microbiome harbors microbes with the capacity to cause infection or drive pathogenic
inflammation. Immune status often determines risk for microbiome-associated disease, which is typically
attributed to immune impacts on microbial community composition. But pathogenic or commensal lifestyles can
also be dynamically regulated within individual microbes, and there is far less understood about immune
impacts on microbial inherent pathogenic potential. Candida albicans is a morphologically and transcriptionally
dynamic commensal fungus that can cause life-threatening infections and exacerbate pathogenic
inflammation. The ability for C. albicans to cause disease depends on its phenotypic state. Of particular
importance is the formation of hyphae, which are elongated cells specialized for adherence and invasion, and
promote disease in both infection and inflammatory settings. Immune status is crucial for determining risk for
C. albicans-associated disease and both immune deficiencies and active inflammation are linked to C. albicans
pathogenesis. However, the role of immune environment on in vivo C. albicans pathogenic potential is not well
understood. Here, I will investigate the impact of two human relevant immune environments on C. albicans
pathogenic potential. Project 1 will focus on IgA regulation of C. albicans biology. Anti-C. albicans IgA
antibodies are found in the gut of most people, and I previously found that C. albicans hyphae and associated
effectors are heavily targeted by IgA during colonization. In mouse models, IgA targeting is associated with
reduced hyphae and reduced capacity to exacerbate colitis. Here, I will interrogate mechanisms by which IgA
regulates C. albicans biology in vivo using a mouse colonization model that permits investigation of immediate
regulatory impacts of IgA targeting on C. albicans biology. Using this model, I will interrogate IgA impacts on C.
albicans morphology and gene expression, which will include single cell transcriptional profiling to investigate
gene expression in individual IgA-targeted cells. The goal of Project 2 is to define the impacts of inflammation
on C. albicans pathogenic potential. Evidence from human IBD studies and mouse models of colitis suggest
that this fungus exploits inflammation to bloom and perpetuate disease. Here, I will use a mouse model of
intestinal colitis to define inflammation-dependent impacts on C. albicans morphology and transcriptional
profile, with the goal of defining C. albicans pathways responsible for disease exacerbation. This proposal will
reveal fundamental mechanisms by which immune environment regulates C. albicans biology and advance our
understanding of how C. albicans becomes pathogenic in certain people. Broadly, these efforts will provide a
foundation for our long-term goal of identifying targeted therapeutic strategies to prevent commensal C.
albicans reservoirs from causing disease."

Our objective in this new R01 proposal is to delineate the impact of a spouse’s substance use and psychiatric
disorders on their partner’s alcohol use disorder (AUD) onset, remission, and relapse during marriage within a
genetically informative framework. To date, efforts to understand spousal influences on alcohol outcomes have
largely focused on alcohol-specific contagion models, whereby alcohol use behaviors in one partner are
socially transmitted to the other. Yet, this prior focus alcohol-specific contagion is restrictive in view of
epidemiological evidence that spouses of AUD-affected individuals also tend to suffer from other common
disorders, including major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, other drug abuse/dependence,
ADHD, and antisocial personality disorder. We build on these epidemiological findings to clarify the nature of
the associations between these other forms of spousal substance use and psychiatric disorders and key
alcohol outcomes including AUD onset, remission, and relapse. We do this within a genetically informative
framework that also recognizes the potential contributions of a spouse’s genetic propensity for a disorder even
in the absence of a diagnosis (i.e., social genetic effects), as well as how the focal individual’s genotype may
differentially sensitize him/her to a spouse’s disorder (i.e., gene-environment interaction effects). Relevant
phenotypic and genotypic data for this secondary data analysis project come from spousal dyads (N = 1,688
dyads) collected as part of the NIAAA-funded Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA). Our
specific aims are to: (1) Delineate the temporal dynamics underlying associations between spousal substance
use and psychiatric disorder diagnoses (inclusive of cannabis use disorder, other psychoactive drug use
disorder, antisocial personal disorder, ADHD, nicotine dependence, major depressive disorder, and PTSD) and
their partner’s AUD onset, remission, and relapse; (2) Identify whether a spouse’s genetic propensity for
psychiatric disorders (above and beyond a diagnosis itself) is associated with their partner’s AUD onset,
remission, and relapse; (3) Examine whether the focal individual’s genetic predisposition for alcohol problems
predicts variability in their sensitivity to spousal substance use and psychiatric disorders; and (4) Evaluate
whether the expected effects differ as a function of sex and parenthood. The results may have theoretical
implications for expanding social stress models of AUD to include spousal substance use and psychiatric
disorders, and in turn this knowledge is anticipated to have implications for couples and family systems-based
preventive interventions for AUD. More broadly, this work will contribute to the collaborative research team’s
long-term goal to elucidate how genetic factors and close relationship factors come together to influence the
onset, persistence, and discontinuity of AUD."

improve the health of mothers and their babies. It is a survey of new mothers
that asks questions about experiences and behaviors before, during and shortly
after pregnancy. A sample of new mothers is selected each month from the birth
file, and stratified by birthweight. The mother is first sent a letter informing her
that she will be receiving a survey. The first survey mailing is sent four days
later with a cover letter that describes the project. It also includes the informed
consent, a question and answer brochure, resource information, return envelope
and a small gift as an incentive. A reminder letter is sent two weeks later to non-

and then a third survey packet after two more weeks. One week after the final
mailing, telephone calls are initiated with any mail nonrespondents. Multiple
phone calls over five weeks are made in an attempt to reach the mother and
persuade her to complete a telephone interview."

 To date, no therapy exists to restore vision to the over 64 million people worldwide who are legally blind from diseases
that damage the optic nerve. Although current approaches for regenerating the optic nerve have successfully directed long
distance axon regeneration, these strategies are still limited by the fact that 1) efficacy has generally been demonstrated
when therapies were initiated before axon injury, which has limited clinical application; 2) they may carry a risk of
neoplastic conversion and thus may not be readily deployed prophylactically; and 3) incidences of off target axon
regeneration have been reported, indicating a need not just for signals that promote but also ones that direct axon growth to
intended targets. Our multi-disciplinary collaboration between electrical engineers, neuroscientists, electrophysiologists,
and neurosurgeons has enabled the collection of compelling preliminary data demonstrating that exogenously applied
electric fields (EFs) control the direction of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon growth, in-vitro. In vivo, stimulation with
asymmetric waveforms was found to be effective at directing full-length optic nerve regeneration, without evidence of
aberrant targeting, and restoring partial visual function (local field potential recordings in the superior colliculus and pattern
electroretinogram) after crush injury. Interestingly, stimulation with symmetric waveforms was more effective at promoting
RGC survival than asymmetric waveforms. The discovery that different waveforms (asymmetric versus symmetric) may
activate distinct signaling pathways that control different cellular behaviors provides a unique opportunity to assess for
synergistic effects from combined stimulation. Here, we propose to compare the efficacy of combined symmetric and
asymmetric EF stimulation on restoring visual function over either treatment alone. Additionally, although EF stimulation
with asymmetric waveforms was successful at restoring partial visual function, local field potential amplitudes within the
superior colliculus were lower and latencies longer than in normal controls. Whether this dysfunction stems from ineffective
RGC synaptic transmission (spatial summation) or absence of myelin (temporal summation) or both is unknown. Here, we
propose to employ immunohistochemical, transsynaptic viral labeling techniques, and electrophysiology experiments to
interrogate the source of this signaling deficiency. If successful, experiments proposed here have the potential to advance
EF application into a strategy that, when applied synergistically with other approaches for RGC axon regeneration, can help
regenerate the optic nerve and restore visual function of patients blinded by optic neuropathies."

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are environmental pathogens present in the soil and water that can cause
chronic, debilitating disease in predominately older patients with underlying bronchiectasis or chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease. The most common causes of NTM pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) are Mycobacterium avium
complex (MAC) and M. abscessus (MAB). Key symptoms of NTM-PD include cough, extreme fatigue, and
shortness of breath. NTM-PD is heterogeneous in presentation: nodular-bronchiectatic disease (~60-70%) tends
to be slowly progressing and if MAC may not require immediate treatment, while those with cavitary disease
(~25%) or MAB require immediate treatment. Multi-drug therapy, when initiated, consists of 3-5 antibiotics taken
for 18+ months. NTM treatment carries risks of significant toxicity and is poorly tolerated by some patients.
Although most patients have microbiologic response to treatment, many are unable to produce sputum for
testing, and treatment success is evaluated as subjective clinical improvement. Changes in cough rates and
patterns are presumed to be important but have not been objectively measured. Further, after completing
treatment, around half will re-develop NTM-PD within 3 years. Unlike its “cousin” tuberculosis where culture
conversion is a surrogate for cure, the meaningfulness of culture conversion to patients in pulmonary NTM is
less clear. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) which measure symptoms, functioning, and health-related quality
of life are key components of patient-centered research and care. Improvements in daily symptoms and
functioning are critical outcomes from the patient’s perspective, but significant evidence gaps exist in the role of
PRO data to inform decisions about when to treat among those who do not require immediate treatment, how to
measure treatment response and tolerability, and how to monitor patients post-treatment.
We propose to fill critical gaps in knowledge regarding the trajectory of PRO measures for NTM-PD and
incorporate an objective cough monitor to measure rates and patterns of cough in patients. This prospective
cohort study leverages our experience establishing an NTM Clinical Trials Network and Northwest NTM Biobank
data repository. We will continue longstanding collaborations with Drs. Winthrop, Daley, Flume, McShane, and
Aksamit for all proposed aims. During Years 1-4 we will enroll 3 well-characterized cohorts of patients
representing key stages of NTM-PD – initial diagnosis (NTM-WATCH), treatment start (NTM-TREAT), and at
end of treatment (NTM-TRACK) from participating sites and collect PROs and clinical outcome data for up to 24
months for each cohort. During Years 3-5 we will conduct our descriptive and longitudinal analysis of PROs in
these prospective cohorts, evaluating PRO measures’ ability to monitor disease activity and tolerability of
treatment. Our findings will lay the groundwork for future evaluation of combined outcome measures for clinical
trials endpoints and, most importantly, incorporation of PRO measures in clinical practice."

Reduced positive affect is a core symptom of many stress-related psychiatric disorders, including depression
and PTSD. Critically, positive affect is not simply the inverse of negative affect, and clinicians struggle to increase
positive affect: Antidepressant and psychotherapeutic interventions often reduce depressed mood but are
ineffective at increasing positive affect. And yet, qualitative studies of patients themselves indicate that a ‘full
recovery’ requires increasing positive emotion, even when other depressive symptoms have subsided.
Despite the critical role of positive emotion, very limited work has identified effective interventions to increase
real-world positive affect to improve mental health. Guided by preclinical work, we recently discovered that
positive affect is increased when going to a greater number of varied locations (“experiential diversity”).
Moreover, the association between experiential diversity and positive affect appears to be supported specifically
by functional connectivity between the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens–a stress susceptible circuit
responsible for assigning reward value to novelty. This finding suggests that increasing experiential diversity
may be a plausible real-world intervention to increase positive affect by strengthening specific neural circuits.
Leveraging a strong team with complimentary expertise in mobile tracking, resting state fMRI, treatment
development, and affective science, this R01 application will expand these initial findings in a large,
demographically representative sample encompassing a range of anhedonia severity (from asymptomatic to
severe) collecting geolocation (GPS), experience sampling of emotion, and functional MRI to, (1) precisely
delineate the specific geospatial features of experiential diversity most strongly linked to increases in momentary
(EMA measured) positive affect (e.g., neighborhoods one has never visited, green spaces, beach/ocean); (2)
determine whether individuals with higher levels of anhedonia have similar affective benefits from these types of
experiential diversity as individuals with lower experiential diversity; (3) determine the neural network circuit
mechanisms supporting associations between experiential diversity and affect as a function of anhedonia; and
(4) in an independent sample, experimentally induce experiential diversity to determine if it causes increased
positive affect. Results from this application will help to define the neural mechanisms by which exploration and
experiential diversity predict increases in positive affect and will yield actionable real-world interventions for a
clinical trial to improve positive affect in those with heightened anhedonia."

Oxidative DNA damage is frequently generated by radiation, chemicals, and endogenous oxygen radicals,
contributing to genomic instability during both aging and tumorigenesis. Oxidative damage at telomeres can
lead to telomere loss or attrition, which triggers cellular senescence and limits the lifespan of dividing cells.
While it is clear that oxygen radicals can inflict multiple types of DNA lesions, how these lesions are repaired at
telomeres is still largely unknown. By inducibly and locally generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) at
telomeres, we discovered a novel DNA repair pathway critical for the protection of cells against telomeric
oxidative damage. This pathway is activated by ROS-induced R-loops, and is mediated by break-induced
replication (BIR), a process that “jumpstarts” DNA synthesis at collapsed replication forks. In parallel with our
studies on the oxidative damage response at telomeres, we also investigated how cancer cells maintain
telomeres to bypass senescence. In particular, we have molecularly dissected the alternative lengthening of
telomere (ALT) pathway, which is used by ~10-15% of human cancers to extend telomeres. Interestingly, we
found that ALT is also an R-loop-triggered and BIR-mediated repair pathway. The unexpected similarities
between the repair pathway dealing with telomeric oxidative damage and the ALT pathway lead us to
hypothesize that these telomere repair pathways are mechanistically linked. Furthermore, cancer cells hijack
the R-loop and BIR-mediated repair pathway to extend telomeres and bypass senescence. In Aim 1, we will
systematically delineate the R-loop and BIR-mediated pathway that repairs telomeric oxidative damage, and
investigate if this pathway contributes to ALT activation in cancer cells. In Aim 2, we will develop strategies to
exploit the cellular dependency on the R-loop and BIR-mediated ALT pathway, which may allow us to
selectively kill ALT+ cancer cells and aged cells harboring high telomeric oxidative damage. Our studies may
establish a new link between cellular aging and tumorigenesis, and provide new opportunities to eliminate
cancer cells by targeting a hijacked DNA repair pathway. These studies may have transformative impacts at
the interface between aging and cancer research, opening a new avenue to future preclinical and clinical
investigations."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) results when pancreatic islet β-cells fail to secrete sufficient insulin to meet peripheral
insulin demand. Mitochondrial bioenergetics is central to the (patho)physiology of β-cell (dys)function, and recent
work suggests that β-cell mitochondrial dysfunction precedes the development of T2D in β-cells from donors
with impaired glucose tolerance (or pre-diabetes). Mitochondrial defects have been reported in the β-cells of
human T2D patients, but the etiology of mitochondrial dysfunction in T2D is unknown. Such mechanistic
knowledge is necessary to guide strategies to prevent or treat islet failure and T2D. Importantly, genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) link single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in >500 genetic loci to T2D and islet
dysfunction-related metabolic traits. The majority of these SNPs are non-coding and overlap regulatory elements
(REs) with broad transcriptional implications for affected cells. In this study, we combine our expertise in the
genomics of T2D, (epi)genomic modification, and mitochondrial function in β-cells to bridge the gap from genomic
association to mechanistic understanding. We hypothesize that non-coding T2D SNPs cause β-cell dysfunction
by altering RE use or activity, thereby changing expression of effector genes that directly impair mitochondrial
health. To test this, we propose to use sophisticated (epi)genomic editing tools in human islets and β-cell specific
mouse models for physiological relevance and validation in two complementary Aims. In Aim 1, we will test RE–
effector gene links in human islets using CRISPR-QTL. In parallel, we will assess T2D risk allele effects on RE
chromatin accessibility, activity, transcription factor binding, and β-cell expression of putative mitochondrial T2D
effector genes using complementary in vivo (single cell chromatin accessibility, histone acetylation, and
expression quantitative trait locus analysis of primary human islets) and in vitro (reporter gene, DNA-binding
assay) approaches. Finally, we will determine the consequences of effector gene perturbation on mitochondrial
phenotypes, β-cell viability, and insulin content and secretion in human islets and EndoC-βH3 cells. In Aim 2,
we harness β-cell-specific knockout mouse models to assign function to two high-priority mitochondrial T2D
effector genes in glycemic control, β-cell mass/function, and mitochondrial metabolism. Further, we will address
the importance of these mitochondrial T2D effector genes for β-cell compensation to peripheral insulin resistance
following diet-induced obesity. Finally, we will use (epi)genomic editing tools in human islets to determine if
mitochondrial T2D effector genes impair β-cell function and glycemic control in ex vivo assays as well as after
islet transplantation into immunodeficient mice. Completion of this study will generate new variant-to-function
connections that assign molecular and cellular functions to T2D risk alleles, identify novel therapeutic targets,
and provide important knowledge to guide subsequent strategies to prevent or treat β-cell failure and T2D."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common and costly neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by a long
pre-clinical stage, including a prodromal stage of AD also referred to as mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
Many, but not all, MCI patients progress to AD dementia at varying rates. Among MCI patients, late stage
MCI patients progress to AD faster than early stage MCI patients: a faster annual cognitive decline with
loss of memory. As potential disease modifying drugs are tested for their ability to delay AD dementia, it
becomes critical to have tools that can better accurately predict MCI-to-AD dementia conversion. This would
allow selection of cohorts most likely to decline during the study period, maximizing the ability to detect a
drug/placebo difference. The proposed project will respond to PA-20-200: NIH Small Research Grant Program
(Parent R03 Clinical Trial Not Allowed). In Aim 1, we will develop new deep survival models to predict MCI-to-
AD dementia conversion using baseline measures, by using data from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
study. We will use data from the NIH funded Center for Neurodegeneration and Translational Neuroscience
(CNTN) as the test data. The majority of the existing deep survival models were developed for right censored
data, but MCI-to-AD dementia conversion is interval censored. When interval censored data are analyzed by
using the methods developed for right censored data, the survival rates are always over-estimated that leads
to the delay in AD dementia diagnosis. We will develop separate prediction models for early stage MCI and
late stage MCI with biomarkers from cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF), positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), and clinical measures. Recently, several new biomarkers have been discovered for
AD that are of interest to this study. These include plasma phosphorylated-tau181 (p-tau181), p-tau217, and
the ratio of amyloid-β 42 and amyloid-β 40, and glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP). In progressive disorders
like AD, most clinical events are very strongly correlated with the dynamics of the disease. In Aim 2, we will
develop novel survival models for interval-censored data with time-varying longitudinal biomarker data. Built
on our developed penalized survival model for interval censored data using baseline measures, we propose to
extend that model to leverage longitudinal biomarker data to produce more accurate predictions about future
conversion. Biomarkers along with clinical and demographic features were shown to improve the model
performances for right censored data. We expect that the new survival models will be able to improve model
prediction for interval censored data as compared to state-of-the-art models. This project will develop optimal
deep survival models to predict MCI-to-AD dementia conversion for each MCI subgroup. The results of this
project will provide important understanding of how each feature contributes to prediction of MCI-to-AD
dementia conversion."

systems-level measurements at molecular, microscopic, and macroscopic scales with spatial resolution will
enable the development of computational models to map and predict tumor dynamics leveraging data integration
and deconvolution for computational modeling of the glioblastoma-microenvironment. The establishment of this
novel GBM model will support the identification of critical signaling and metabolic pathways and networks
regulating tumor progression and therapeutic resistance, while providing biomarkers of tumor state and efficacy
for therapeutic developement. Project 1 will focus on elucidating networks coordinating the tumor-neuronal
interface. Recent results uncovered the ability of subpopulations of glioblastoma cells to organize in brain tumor
cell networks that include the formation of glutamatergic synapses formed between individual glioblastoma cells
and neural cells from the normal brain. The establishment of synaptic connectivity was proposed to promote
tumor cell movement along white matter, therefore implying that the mutually connected glioma cells may drive
invasion of the normal brain, which is the primary mechanism of progression and aggressiveness of malignant
glioma that ultimately renders these tumors incurable. We will now leverage key preclinical resources established
by our labs, including an integrated computational-experimental framework, annotated GBM patient-derived
xenografts (PDXs) for ex vivo and in vivo mechanistic experiments to derive a model of glioma-neuron
interactions that drive the malignant nature of glioblastoma and how perturbation of this signaling network affects
tumor proliferation, invasion, and therapeutic resistance. In Aim 1, we will use our innovative multi-omics platform
with ex vivo slice culture models to investigate the ability of neurons to support tumor cell growth and invasion
and affect cell state and develop and implement computational modeling strategies to model the dynamic
evolution of different cell types and tumor cell clones over time and in response to stimulation. Aim 2 will allow
further parametrization of the computational model with data acquired from in vivo orthotopic models tested
for the effect of anti-epileptic drugs on tumor proliferation and invasion in the context of standard of care treatment
with radiotherapy and recurrence. In Aim 3, we will analyze the impact of anti-epileptic therapeutics on the
glioma-brain network in clinical trial tissue specimens with our multi-omics platform, allowing to test and
optimize the model accuracy with clinically relevant data."
10930073,"ABSTRACT – PROJECT 2
The central premise of our CSBC MIT/DFCI Center for Systems Biology in Glioblastoma is that high-content
systems-level measurement techniques, employed across a variety of scales (molecular-cellular-tissue) with
cell-type specific and spatial resolution, and combined with data integration, data deconvolution, and
computational modeling, will enable the identification of critical pathways and networks regulating tumor
progression and therapeutic resistance, while also providing biomarkers reflecting tumor state and efficacy of
improved therapeutic strategies. This project aims to apply this same premise to the tumor-immune interface,
defining the molecular pathways and networks underlying the dynamic evolution of the immunosuppressive state
of GBM tumors. To this end, we have designed a multi-tiered project, with the foundation based on carefully
controlled co-evolution of the tumor-immune interface in co-culture model systems in vitro, with temporal
systems-level multi-omic analysis of molecular nodes in specific cell types provided by experimental and
computational deconvolution. Computational modeling of this data coupled to quantitative phenotypic data will
yield predictions as to nodes, pathways, and networks associated with altered immune and tumor states that will
be experimentally verified. In the second Aim, we extend these studies to multiple GEMM and syngeneic murine
models to query the tumor-immune interface in vivo, with spatial and temporal systems-level analysis at different
time points of tumor development and in response to therapy. We also use this Aim to interrogate the role of
different immune cells in mediating the evolution of the tumor-immune interface by engineering mice lacking
various immune cell types and repeating the above studies. Computational modeling of these data connect
molecular networks with dynamic evolution in the more complex in vivo environment. Finally, in the third Aim of
this project, we extend these analyses to geographically distinct regions of human GBM tumors through systems-
level analysis of spatially-guided core biopsies. These human tumor specimens provide ‘ground truth’ data for
our computational models and enable development of quantitative models predicting the therapeutic impact of
different treatment strategies. Together, this project will yield unprecedented systems-level molecular insight into
the tumor-immune interface, enabling identification of novel therapeutic targets to abrogate the
immunosuppressive nature of GBM tumors."
10916480,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT – Overall UCSF Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC)
The UCSF OAIC theme is ""Predictors, Outcomes, and Amelioration of Late-life Disability: A Focus on
Vulnerable Populations."" Late-life disability will affect 80% of older Americans, has a profound impact on
patient and caregiver quality of life, and carries large costs. These challenges have special resonance for older
adults who are vulnerable, which we conceptualize as a complex interplay of both medical vulnerability (such
as cancer in persons with complex multimorbidity) and social vulnerability (such as social isolation or poverty).
We are deeply committed to advancing the science of preventing and ameliorating disability in older adults with
these vulnerabilities, in large part by mentoring and supporting the future leaders of aging science who will
develop this theme. During our first 9 years, the UCSF OAIC has supported and mentored an interdisciplinary
community of investigators whose paradigm-shifting research that has changed clinical practice and policy and
yielded major advances in our understanding of disability, including elucidating inextricable linkages between
medical and social vulnerabilities. We have been a galvanizing force at UCSF, infusing aging science into a
wide array of specialties and disciplines. Our dedication to developing the next generation of researchers has
led to publications in the highest impact journals, R01 awards, an unprecedented number of GEMSSTAR and
Beeson Awards, and mentorship awards for OAIC Leaders.
During the next cycle, we will build on our track record of success while growing and innovating in new
directions to respond to emerging opportunities. Our two resource cores – the Data and Analysis Core (DAC)
and the Vulnerable Aging Research Core (VARC) - will catalyze a wide spectrum of clinical and outcomes
research. Our Research and Education Component (REC) Scholars and Pilot and Exploratory Studies (PESC)
Scholars will be provided the resources, mentorship, and community to build a platform for long-term research
success in our theme area. Our Leadership and Administration Core (LAC) will guide the Center's activities
and mission and ensure tight integration between all of our Cores and activities. Together, we will advance our
center's 5 aims: to (1) Catalyze research on disability in vulnerable older persons by serving as a hub that
brings together scholars and leverages resources to advance aging disability science and career development;
(2) Provide core access to data resources, statistical support, and expertise enrolling and retaining vulnerable
older subjects in order to stimulate new research on disability; (3) Identify the future leaders of geriatrics
research and catalyze their development with career development funding and exceptional mentoring; (4)
Support pilot studies that accelerate aging science and lead to research funding in late life disability; and (5)
Develop a leadership and administrative structure that spurs interdisciplinary collaboration, making the OAIC
greater than the sum of its parts."
10930078,"ABSTRACT – EDUCATION AND OUTREACH CORE
The scientific goal of our CSBC U54 MIT/DFCI Center for Systems Biology in Glioblastoma is to change the
current paradigm in GBM research by bringing new tools and algorithms to improve analysis of the tumor-
microenvironment interface, providing ultra-deep systems level molecular characterization at the transcript,
protein, phosphoprotein, and metabolite levels while maintaining cell-type specific resolution, with the ultimate
aim of developing improved therapeutic strategies for this devastating tumor. Using this theme as a platform, we
will engage systems biologists, computational biologists, cancer biologists, and clinicians at all levels of training
to cultivate improved cross-disciplinary fluency. Ultimately, these efforts will have an enduring impact on the field
by educating future scientists and oncologists and by fostering lasting trans-disciplinary collaborations between
established scientists. We will maximize the education and outreach impact of the center through a multi-tiered
strategy to promote experiential training and communication across a range of educational and career levels:
High school and undergraduate students: We will tap into and expand existing internship and research
 opportunity programs at several of our sites to engage both teachers and students in the exciting trans-
 disciplinary studies being performed in the MIT/DFCI CSBC. The central goal for these activities is to enthuse
 participants about potential STEM careers and provide real-world experiences in different facets of cancer
 systems biology.
Graduate student and post-doctoral training: We will establish a cross-training program that will provide funding
 for visiting scientists within the MIT/DFCI CSBC or within the larger CSBC network. The vision of this
 program is to enable cross-disciplinary training, allowing researchers to learn new technologies, be exposed
 to different ways of thinking about problems, and to gain insight into clinical translation. By providing support
 for weeks-to-months of interaction time for multiple visiting scientists per year, this program should provide
 solid experiential training and immersion in the corresponding field.
Annual symposia and visiting faculty series: An annual conference hosted by the MIT/DFCI CSBC will rotate
 among the sites involved in our center. A key goal of these conferences is to establish collaborative
 interdisciplinary opportunities with our CSBC and within the larger CSBC network. Targeted selection of
 speakers will maximize the potential for complementary collaborations with the host institution and across
 the CSBC network. A similar strategy will be employed in developing a rotating visiting faculty seminar series.
Web-site and public engagement: To broadcast all of these opportunities and to educate the public with regard
to the systems biology of the brain tumor – microenvironment interface, we will establish a center website.
This website will also serve as the hub for accessing data, publications, and computational models generated
by our CSBC."
10886698,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The purpose of the Impact Neuroscience Program is to enhance rigorous scientific training in neuroscience at
Duke University and change the culture of science. The program will embrace and engage students from
backgrounds under-represented in science together with their peer colleagues and mentors, and improve the
academic scientific training environment for all. The Impact Neuroscience Program includes targeted
neuroscience training and professional development activities for graduate students from backgrounds under-
represented in science, and perhaps even more importantly programs for their peer colleagues and mentors.
The targeted neuroscience training includes specific neuroscience methods and skills training within faculty
labs, specialized training in data science and open science, and active trainee and faculty participation in
a professional seminar that provides resources for career development. A critical broader focus of the program
includes supporting the scientist through community interventions that evolve the training infrastructure at Duke
to facilitate thriving for all. Our goal is not to fix students who are disadvantaged in science, it is rather to
change our paradigms and culture in order to enrich our community and catalyze achievement. In
addition to activities with strong extant evidentiary support, we propose several new interventions based on the
neuroscience of motivated learning, to be tested and evaluated in the program. We predict improved retention,
training, and long-term performance for the primary graduate student fellows. We also predict broad benefits
for the community including enhanced overall performance of host labs."
10895521,"Project Abstract
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and invasive breast cancer subtype, accounting for
10-15% of breast cancer diagnoses. TNBC affects African-American (AA) women three times more than
Caucasian-American (CA) women. Metastasis to distant vital organs such as bone, liver, lung, and brain is the
most devastating feature of TNBC in AA women. Tumor-derived exosomes are mediators of aggressive distant
metastasis by contributing to the establishment of a pre-metastatic niche. Therefore, it is critical to investigate
the molecular mechanism(s) that drive tumor-derived exosome-mediated immune modulation and pre-
metastatic niche formation for aggressive metastasis in TNBC. Annexin A2 (AnxA2) is an often identified
exosomal protein with elevated levels in TNBC patient sera and cell lines. The higher expression of exosomal
AnxA2 (exo-AnxA2) in serum samples is associated with poor overall survival and poor disease-free survival
in breast cancer patients. In addition, the expression of serum exo-AnxA2 is significantly high in AA women
with TNBC and promotes angiogenesis. Our data suggest a role for Exo-AnxA2 in establishing a pre-
metastatic niche by immune modulation, which subsequently promotes TNBC metastasis. The goal of our
research is to develop improved therapeutic options for TNBC. We hypothesize that high expression of Exo-
AnxA2 plays a vital role in immune modulation at the pre-metastatic niche, thereby promoting TNBC
metastasis. We will address this hypothesis by the following two specific aims: Aim 1: Determine the
mechanism(s) that drive exo-AnxA2-mediated immune modulation and metastatic niche formation for
aggressive metastasis in breast cancer. Aim 2: Determine the role of patient-derived exo-AnxA2 with
measures of disease aggressiveness among racially distinct populations of TNBC patients using humanized
mouse model system. We predict that high concentrations of exo-AnxA2 in the sera of TNBC patients will be
shown to contribute to the aggressive biology of this disease, especially in AA women, by immune modulation
at the pre-metastatic niche site."
10873260,"Project Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, the virus responsible for the global
COVID-19 pandemic of unprecedented scale causes a multi-organ disease with widespread effects. Increasing
evidence suggests long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in some individuals present up to a year after
initial infection, referred to as Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC). Pregnant women and their
fetuses may be particularly vulnerable to the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The biological
plausibility and emerging epidemiological evidence from SARS-CoV-2 infections in the population highlight the
urgent need for research on the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy on women’s
cardiometabolic and neuropsychiatric health outcomes and children’s growth and development. Limitations of
current studies of both pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection and their children exposed in utero,
include a lack of long-term follow-up, lack of data on pre-existing conditions making it difficult to disentangle
risk factors for the infection from its consequences, and limited ability to examine associations by predominant
SARS-CoV-2 variant and vaccination status. The proposed study leverages Kaiser Permanente Northern
California’s (KPNC’s) high-quality electronic health records (EHR) data on SARS-CoV-2 infection testing and
results to assemble a longitudinal pregnancy cohort of >195,000 pregnant women (>22,000 women with
SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and approximately>173,000 without) between March 2020 and
December 2022. We will use our robust and comprehensive EHR to follow women and their children for up to 5
years and ascertain clinical diagnoses data. Additionally, we will recruit and survey a subsample of 2000 of the
mother-child dyads when the child is 3 years old to ascertain women’s and children’s self/parent-reported
subclinical health outcomes not available in the EHR, but that may suggest a need to monitor and/or provide
early interventions. We will randomly identify 1000 dyads with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy (1/3
early variants, 1/3 Delta and 1/3 Omicron variants) and 1000 dyads without SARS-CoV-2 infection during
pregnancy. Our study will assess the following: 1) Evaluate the long-term effects of a SARS-CoV-2 infection
during pregnancy on women’s cardiometabolic and neuropsychiatric outcomes (EHR and self-report), and 2)
Evaluate the long-term effects of in utero exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection on child growth trajectory and
neurodevelopment (EHR and parent-report). We will examine variant, severity of infection and gestational age
at infection in relation to all outcomes of interest and explore effect modification by vaccination status,
race/ethnicity and pre-existing co-morbidities. Finally, our analyses will include infection status before, during
and after pregnancy or birth allowing for estimation of joint effects. This project will fill a significant gap
informing women and children exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, the public, clinicians, and
health care systems of the full spectrum of health consequences of infection."
10890860,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Aging-associated vascular and cerebrovascular dysfunction is prevalent in many connective tissue disorders.
Marfan syndrome (MFS) is the most common monogenetic autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue,
characterized by mutations in the gene encoding for fibrillin-1 (Fbn1), with no gender or ethnic bias. Fbn1
protein provides structural support for muscles, bones, and blood vessels as well as a scaffold for elastin fiber
maturation and to bind cytokines and prevent deleterious downstream signaling. MFS-associated Fbn1
mutation results in an increased risk of life-threatening problems involved in weakening of blood vessel walls
that can lead to dilation, dissection, and rupture. The role of Fbn1 mutation on cerebrovascular function has
barely begun to be addressed though MFS causes neurological deficits including headaches, migraines,
cerebral aneurysms, stroke, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Extracellular matrix (ECM) impairment,
vascular wall weakening, and stiffening, blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and exacerbated cytokine
production are hallmark alterations associated with cerebrovascular aging and are prevalent in MFS. These
manifestations in aging and MFS occur due to increased transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling. In
mice, Fbn1 mutation induces vascular dysfunction by 6-month (6M) of age. This readily accessible model has
been used in more than 290 studies, where only two have addressed the cerebrovasculature, demonstrating
increased middle cerebral artery (MCA) wall/lumen hypertrophy, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the
MCA, BBB permeability, and TGF-β cytokine and MMP production in the choroid plexus. These results and
data from this lab suggest that increased cerebrovascular aging is occurring in this model similar to that of
normal aging, but with an accelerated pace. This has led to the hypothesis that Fbn1 mutation accelerates
aging-associated compromise in cerebrovascular function and neurobehavioral alterations. To test this, Fbn1+/-
mice at 6M, and C57BL/6 mice at 6 (CTRL) and 12M (WT) will be evaluated for cerebrovascular alterations
and neuropathology through these Aims: 1) measure the expression of TGF-β signaling molecules in plasma
and the hippocampus in an Fbn1+/- mouse model. 2) evaluate cerebrovascular structure and function in an
Fbn1+/- mouse model. 3) examine neuropathological morphology and function in an Fbn1+/- mouse model. A
strong mentoring team supports this proposal and provides expertise and resources. Data from this lab support
that Fbn1 mutation plays a critical role in accelerated cerebrovascular aging and neuropathology that increases
the risk of vulnerability for more severe outcomes after neurological insult such as mild traumatic brain injury.
Impact: This is the first investigation of Fbn1 mutation as a contributor to accelerated cerebrovascular aging
and dysfunction, where the TGF-β signaling pathway may reveal mechanisms and therapeutic targets for
prevention and protection against increasing vascular dysfunction and neuropathology in MFS, similar
connective tissue disorders, and the aging population."
10876391,"Rigorous biocontainment prevents laboratory mice from being infected with natural pathogens and allows
researchers to perform animal experiments in a reliable and reproducible manner. However, such specific
pathogen-free (SPF) mice do not necessily model immune responses that occur in nature, and this may
contribute to the often-reported disconnect between pre-clinical research and human clinical trials. Athough
many key advances in biomedical research have been made possible by the study of SPF mice, there is
now compelling evidence that microbial or viral experience can greatly impact immune pathophysiology. In
past two decades, regulatory T (Treg) cells have emerged as a dedicated immune population crucial for the
negative regulation of immune responses. Considering that Treg cell homeostasis and function can be
greatly influenced by unique signals present in different tissue environments, it is conceiable that the
microbial exposure outside the current laboratory setting could heavily impact Treg cells and their ability not
only to establish immunological tolerance against ‘‘self’’ or innocuous foreign antigens, but also to keep in
check effector immune responses to pathogens. To gain a better understanding of Treg cell-mediated
immune regulation in a more physiological setting, we have worked closely with the Animal Care Program at
UC San Diego to establish a new protocol to generate, maintain, and extensively characterize a stable
repository of physiological microbe-exposed environmentally conditioned (PC) animals. By taking this
approach, two well-establsihed mouse models that affords Treg cell isolation and Treg cell-specific ablation
will be first adapted to the “dirty” condition. Next, through performing extensive comparative immune
phenotype analysis and single-cell sequencing studies of Treg cells isolated from both lymphoid and
non-lymphoid tissues in SPF mice and PC mice, the impact of physiological microbial exposure on Treg cell
biology will be determined. Finally, we will examine the suppressor function of Treg cells from PC mice to
maintain immune homeostasis and to control ongoing inflammation in comparison with their SPF
counterparts. Together, our study will not only further extend our fundamental knowledge of Treg
cell-dependent immune regulation but also provide critical insights into the possibilities and limitations of
targeting Treg cells to treat a wide array of human immunological diseases.

11064597,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the fastest-rising causes of cancer-related mortality in the United
States. The biggest risk factor for developing HCC is viral infection (HBV and HCV). Other factors include non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcohol use, and obesity/metabolic syndromes. Genetics also plays an
important role in the development and progression of HCC. Notably, HCC burden is disproportionately
expressed among different ethnic groups; the incidence and mortality rates are much higher in Hispanics than
in non-Hispanic whites (NHW) for both genders, particularly in South Texas where Hispanics are the fastest-
growing population. Moreover, Hispanics with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection are at a signiﬁcantly higher risk
of developing cirrhosis and HCC compared to NHW with HCV. One major target of HCV proteins is the
mitochondria. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) alterations and mitochondrial dysfunction are implicated in various
types of cancer, including HCC. A human mtDNA haplogroup is defined by unique sets of mtDNA
polymorphisms, reflecting mutations accumulated by a discrete lineage. The distribution of mitochondrial
haplogroups in the Hispanic population differs greatly from that of the NHW population, which may have some
influcence on the higher incidence of HCC in Hispanics. Based on these facts and our previous studies, we
seek to determine whether and how distinct mitochondrial haplogroups, mitochondrial dysfunction, and HCV
infection (as well as the interactions between these factors) impact HCC tumorigenesis and progresion. The
hypothesis tested here is that (1) Hispanic-specific mitochondrial haplogroup(s) and possible associated
reduced OXPHOS provide a mitochondrial background that favors HCC progresion and (2) that the
interactions between HCV proteins and mitochondrial machinery compromise OXPHOS and critical aspects of
mitochondrial pathways, leading to HCC tumorigenesis. Our recent breakthroughs include the following: (1) the
establishment of Hispanic HCC cell lines and (2) the generation of an inducible, dosage-dependent, non-
mitochondrial-conflicting expression system, which will enable us to test the overarching hypothesis. We will
generate cybrids with a Hispanic HCC nuclear background but different mitochondrial haplogroups and
investigate mitochondrial function and tumorigenesis in these cybrids. We will also test the hypotheses that (1)
reduced mitochondrial function increases HCC tumorigenesis while enhanced OXPHOS activity will decrease
HCC tumorigenesis and (2) a Hispanic-specific background will sensitize the cells to HCV-mediated HCC
tumorigenesis. Finally, taking advantage of big data about HCC patients in public databases and our unique
access to our institute’s large liver Biobank with Hispanic HCC patient samples, we will complement these
molecular investigations with bioinformatics and human epidemiology studies to verify associations between
mitochondrial genetics, mitochondrial function, and HCV infection in the development and progression of HCC
in the Hispanic population."
10904941,"Severe, disabling pain is the hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD). SCD pain is associated with poor quality of
life, early mortality, and high healthcare costs. Clinicians face great challenges in managing SCD pain because
of the poor understanding of the etiology of chronic/persistent SCD pain and the absence of validated clinical
prognostic tools that can accurately identify individuals with SCD who are at risk of developing severe,
persistent pain with associated physical and/or psychological disability. The overall objective of this project is to
identify predictors of pain severity and pain-related outcomes in SCD using a prospective, longitudinal study
design informed by the biopsychosocial model of pain. This proposal is supported by the hypothesis that painspecific
psychological and sensory factors are strong, modifiable predictors of SCD pain severity and painrelated
outcomes. The understanding of pain-specific psychological and sensory predictors of SCD pain
outcomes is anticipated to have important implications for (1) identifying SCD patients who are at risk for
severe pain outcomes, (2) informing preventive and therapeutic management of SCD pain, and (3) selecting
patients for clinical trials of non-opioid interventions for SCD pain. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing
two specific aims: Aim 1) Determine psychological predictors of pain outcomes; and Aim 2) Ascertain the
strength of pain distribution and sensitivity as predictors of pain outcomes. The candidate will use reliable and
well validated pain-specific patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires to evaluate the strength of
psychological factors for predicting pain severity and other pain-related outcomes in the study cohort (Aim 1)
and will use body mapping and quantitative sensory testing (QST) to examine sensory predictors of pain
outcomes (Aim 2). The prospective, longitudinal design of this study and the use of biopsychosocial model of
pain are innovative. The candidate's long-term goal is to become an interdisciplinary SCD pain expert who is
a leading contributor to the treatment and understanding of the etiology and prognosis of chronic pain in
adolescents and young adults with SCD. Her interdisciplinary training background in pediatrics and
anesthesiology uniquely positions her for pursuing this research agenda. Through a detailed and specific
career development plan developed in conjunction with her mentoring panel, the candidate will acquire formal
training and expertise in SCD management, QST, assessment of the conceptual and psychometric properties
of PROs, and advanced statistical modeling (risk prediction and prognostic modeling). Her mentoring and
advisory committee includes an outstanding group of experts in psychosocial influencers of chronic pain
(Francis J. Keefe PhD, Duke), QST (Claudia M. Campbell PhD, Johns Hopkins), SCD (Nirmish Shah MD
and Paula Tanabe PhD, Duke; and Wally Smith MD, Virginia Commonwealth University), predictive modeling
(Yi-Ju Li, PhD, Duke) and prognostic research in pain (Andrey Bortsov MD/PhD, Duke). Successful
completion of this project is anticipated to improve the quality of life of individuals living with SCD."
10724261,"Modulations in frequency and amplitude are fundamental attributes of natural sounds. Frequency modulation
(FM) is essential for sound segregation, talker recognition, and the tracking of prosody in speech and music.
FM sensitivity degrades with normal aging and hearing loss, thereby restricting the communication abilities of
older and hearing-impaired individuals. Importantly, assistive listening devices, such as hearing aids and
cochlear implants, have not been successful in restoring FM sensitivity. This limitation is in part due to an
incomplete understanding of the neural and perceptual mechanisms underlying FM coding. Human FM
perception is best at the low rates (fm < ~5-10 Hz) and carrier frequencies (fc < 4-5 kHz) that are also most
relevant for speech and music, with sensitivity worsening at faster rates and/or higher carriers. These rate and
carrier-dependent trends are widely believed to reflect dual mechanisms for FM coding: one mechanism based
on precise phase-locking to temporal fine structure (TFS; time code), and another based on the fidelity of
cochlear filtering across the tonotopic axis and amplitude modulation (AM) processing (envelope/place code).
Crucially, slow-rate, low-carrier FM has been treated as the gold standard behavioral measure for monaural
TFS coding. The proposed research will use a combination of psychoacoustics, computational modeling, and
electroencephalography (EEG) to test the hypothesis that neural and perceptual FM sensitivity in normal-
hearing listeners can instead be explained by a unitary neural place code. Aim 1 will provide new insights into
the necessity of time coding in FM detection in young, normal-hearing listeners by testing whether classic
behavioral evidence for time coding is also found when using novel amplitude-modulated stimuli that provide
no TFS cues. Aim 2 uses a rigorous, large-scale approach to test whether perceptual and neural degradations
in slow FM processing with age can be accounted for by TFS coding, as currently believed, or whether these
changes too can be explained within the unified framework based on place coding. This aim has important
clinical implications, as it provides the first large-scale replication and extension of a new EEG measure, the
FM following response (FMFR), which has been claimed to reflect individual fidelity of TFS coding to slow FM.
The results will provide the preliminary data and foundation for future studies with hearing-impaired listeners to
determine how these critical acoustic cues are affected by different types and degrees of hearing loss and how
both perceptual and neural responses can be explained within a unifying theoretical framework in order to
provide a novel basis for future sensory interventions."
10877174,"Abstract
The intestinal pathogen Shigella flexneri is the causative agent of bacillary dysentery (bloody diarrhea) and is
responsible for more than 250 million cases of dysentery annually, resulting in more than 200,000 deaths. A
major challenge in combating bacillary dysentery has been the lack of a small-animal model that recapitulates
the symptoms observed in infected individuals. Our group has recently developed a unique model of bacillary
dysentery in infant rabbits. In this model, animals infected with S. flexneri experience massive epithelial cell
fenestration, vascular lesions, immune cell infiltration, and bloody diarrhea. While the bacterial factors
supporting S. flexneri intracellular infection have been chiefly determined using tissue culture systems, we
know very little about the virulence determinants leading to pathogenesis in infected individuals. In this
application, we propose to use the infant rabbit model in conjunction with Transposon-sequencing approaches
to identify and characterize the bacterial factors supporting bacillary dysentery."
10763021,"During endocytosis, the cell's plasma membrane is deformed and internalized to bring in extracellular
cargo and transmembrane receptors. Nonclathrin/noncaveolar (CLIC/GEEC) endocytosis internalizes
glycosylated receptors and extracellular fluid, and is connected to cell polarity development, blebbing, and the
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition during cancer metastasis. A molecular and mechanical understanding of
CLIC is necessary to understand how CLIC coordinates membrane curvature and actin polymerization to
internalize the plasma membrane against membrane tension.
 The primary limitation in studying CLIC has been the lack of unambiguous markers for the process. A
machine learning approach used in Dr. Akamatsu's postdoctoral lab to classify bona fide endocytic events will
be adapted to disambiguate markers for CLIC endocytosis relative to other types of endocytosis. This will
define the first unique markers for CLIC and will reveal the order of protein assembly during CLIC membrane
internalization, which is essential for understanding the function of each protein. To test the hypothesis that
membrane tension controls CLIC progression, Dr. Akamatsu will combine lattice light-sheet microscopy with a
calibration method he developed during his postdoctoral research to convert fluorescence intensity to numbers
of molecules in live cells. With this new method, molecule-counting lattice light-sheet microscopy, he will
measure the numbers of molecules of CLIC endocytic proteins at both the apical and basolateral surfaces of
polarized iPS cells, which differ in their membrane tension. He will image the cells under osmotic stress to
increase cellular membrane tension. Finally, to understand the feedback relationship between membrane
curvature-sensing BAR proteins and actin polymerization during CLIC membrane internalization, he will
incorporate membrane tubulation by BAR proteins and their reciprocal interactions with actin filament
nucleation proteins into a multi-scale mathematical model developed during his postdoctoral work. Simulations
of this model will predict the critical feedback relationships between plasma membrane curvature, tension and
actin polymerization necessary for the timely completion of CLIC endocytosis. Predictions from the model will
be tested in his own lab by imaging cells endogenously expressing protein domain truncations in the presence
of inhibitors of actin nucleation and polymerization.
 Dr. Akamatsu has a longstanding interest in combining physical modeling with live-cell quantitative
experiments. One to two years of additional postdoctoral training will allow him to fully develop both skills in
order to effectively implement a highly synergistic feedback loop in his own lab. Co-advising in experimental
approaches by David Drubin and in computational modeling by Padmini Rangamani at UCSD have given him
the foundation for this integrated approach. Additional training in theory from Padmini Rangamani and Hernan
Garcia, and in quantitative experimental methods from Eric Betzig, Matt Welch, and Dan Fletcher will fully
prepare him to lead an integrated modeling and experimental lab of his own."
10915605,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Warburg Effect (WE) is the enhanced anaerobic conversion of glucose to lactate observed in tumor and
retinal cells, even in normoxia. Both tumor and retinal cells repurpose glucose for anabolic biosynthesis of lipid,
protein, RNA/DNA, and antioxidant molecules. In the retina, dysregulation of anabolic processes is associated
with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which afflicts 15 million Americans with devastating effects on
their vision. Anabolic processes are regulated by the glycolytic enzymes pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) and
aldolase. Aldolase promotes anabolism by regulating PKM2 activity (conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate [PEP]
to pyruvate [Pyr]), which is controlled by its phosphorylation status. Furthermore, anti-PKM2 and anti-ALDOC
antibodies have been identified in AMD patient retinas, implicating their involvement in anabolic dysregulation
in AMD pathogenesis. Thus, understanding the interplay between PKM2 and ALDOC - two key mediators of
the WE - will help elucidate the mechanisms by which anabolic processes are regulated in healthy retinas and
how they are dysregulated in pathogenic conditions.
Our preliminary studies show that non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src phosphorylates PKM2 in vitro. Our earlier
studies show that in the retina Src activation and PTP1B activity inhibition are light- and rhodopsin-dependent.
We will test the hypothesis that cSrc and PTP1B regulate PKM2 phosphorylation, thereby determining the
mechanism of light- and rhodopsin-dependent regulation of anabolism in photoreceptor (PR) cells (Aim 1). In
Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that ALDOC affects PKM2 in diverse ways in the PR and retinal pigment
epithelial (RPE) cells, thereby determining the regulatory role of ALDOC in RPE and PR cells. Aim 3 will test
the hypothesis that retinal aging and AMD are accompanied by a PKM2-dependent dynamic change in actively
translated mRNA repertoire, thereby elucidating the role of PKM2 in regulating PR and RPE gene expression
The outcome of this project will be a deeper understanding of how mediators of the WE regulate retina
structure, functions, and viability. This knowledge is fundamentally important for understanding how PR and
RPE cells function and stay alive in normal and pathologic conditions, and are directly relevant to the mission
of the National Eye Institute, NIH. Successful completion of these studies will pave the path for developing
strategies to prevent/delay retinal degeneration."

This research project directly addresses objective one of the NORA for the Public Safety Sector which calls for
research to “Identify exposures experienced by fire service and wildland firefighters” and to “develop improved
and cost-efficient technologies for the detection of contaminants that may be present during firefighting” in order
to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other chronic diseases amongst firefighters,
including wildland firefighters. The project also addresses priorities to reduce work-related illness by better
describing and characterizing exposures to hazardous chemicals, including those from wildfires in the
Agriculture (Objective AG-02) and Forestry (Objective FO-02) Sectors, and the project addresses Cross-
Sector priorities to “Develop new field equipment/strategies for the assessment of occupational exposures for
the study of respiratory health” and to “develop and evaluate industrial hygiene sampling and analytical methods
(including biomonitoring and other methods) for the determination of carcinogen exposures” (Objective 2; CRC
Cross-Sector).
The objective of this project is to develop a low cost and highly sensitive multiplex biosensor system integrated with
a smartphone readout that can rapidly and accurately analyze a panel of woodsmoke-derived biomarkers
amongst wildland firefighters at anticipated low concentrations. Of particular importance to this approach is the
ability to couple a simple sample separation strategy with a parallel sensor platform and smartphone readout for
simultaneous quantification of multiple targets, and to increase sensitivity using single-atom nanozymes (SANs)
amplification. This is significant to identify multiple analytes at low concentrations in biological matrices, such as
those will be developed in this project. Further integration with a smartphone reader, the proposed biosensor will
provide quantitative results, and allow real-time data collection and sharing. In this project, we will collect blood
and urine samples from field firefighters to investigate the woodsmoke-associated biomarkers and evaluate the
proposed biosensor system. Short-term outcomes of this research will include publication and presentation of
research results; whereas, intermediate outcomes will focus on the development/validation of a sensor platform
using samples collected from field firefighters with an eventual end outcome (beyond scope of current project)
of using the sensor system for measuring and subsequently reducing firefighters’ exposure to wood smoke. The
development, validation and subsequent deployment of a multiplex sensor platform as a quantitative tool to
measure mixed firefighters’ occupational exposures is fully consistent with the goals of the NIOSH Research to
Practice (r2P) initiative. This approach will provide better analytical performance (e.g., sensitivity, dynamic
range, detection limit, reliability, accuracy, and speed) as well as operational performance (user-friendly design)
than the current laboratory-based method."

Chromatin modifications that enhance DNA accessibility: Eukaryotic DNA is tightly packaged into
nucleosomes, which form structural barriers to transcription, yet RNA polymerases effectively read
through chromatinized DNA in cells. Crucial to this apparent paradox are ATP-independent histone
chaperones, which include the heterodimeric FACT (FAcilitates Chromatin Transcription) complex and
the monomeric proteins lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF) and hepatoma-derived growth
factor 2 (HDGF2). Whereas FACT’s role as a histone chaperone is well-established, LEDGF and HDGF2
were only recently implicated as having histone chaperone activity. Furthermore, LEDGF and HDGF2
have also been implicated in modulating human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) DNA integration
into chromatin, with LEDGF playing a dominant role, but the mechanisms remain unclear. We
hypothesize that: (i) FACT facilitates chromatin remodeling by preferentially binding to nucleosomes
destabilized by post-translational histone modifications, preserving histone-DNA interactions necessary
for nucleosome reassembly; (ii) LEDGF and HDGF2 function as reader proteins, working selectively
through their preferential binding to regions rich in H3K36me2/3 histone modifications, but have
mechanistic similarities to FACT imparted by auxiliary domains; (iii) through their histone chaperone
activity, LEDGF and HDGF2 proteins modulate HIV-1 DNA integration into actively transcribed genes
characterized by chaperone-destabilized H3K36me2/3-rich chromatin. We propose two aims:
Aim 1: Define the differential effects of FACT on the chromatin state To test the hypothesis that
FACT acts as a chaperone by preferentially binding to unwound chromatin intermediates and chromatin
destabilized by histone modifications, we will apply forces with optical tweezers to determine the
equilibrium stability, fluctuational opening rate, and the ability of nucleosomes to reassemble after
disruption in the presence of WT, mutant, and truncated FACT for histones modified through destabilizing
acylation modifications. The results will reveal the extent to which FACT activity can be regulated by
destabilizing histone modifications. Aim 2: Determine the mechanisms by which LEDGF and HDGF2
act as histone chaperones and facilitators of HIV-1 integration. To test the hypotheses that LEDGF
and HDGF2 bind H3K36me2/3-containing nucleosomes and mediate nucleosome disassembly and
reassembly and that LEDGF and HDGF2 direct HIV-1 DNA integration at H3K36me2/3-enriched loci
through their nucleosome chaperone activity at these sites, we will measure the effects of wild type and
mutant LEDGF and HDGF2 on nucleosome stability, dynamics and reassembly, as well as their effects
on HIV-1 integrase binding. The results will determine the mechanism of LEDGF and HDGF2
nucleosome chaperone activity and the role played by histone methylation in regulating that activity."
10918340,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Cancer is the second most frequent cause of death in children under 15 years of age, and primary central
nervous system (CNS) tumors are the most frequent cause of cancer-related childhood deaths. Medulloblastoma
(MB) is the most frequent malignant childhood brain tumor (incidence of 5.5/million/year). About 40% of cases
occur in children <5 years old, which can be sub-divided by biological markers into two groups: low-risk group,
biologically defined by either Wingless/Integrated (WNT) or Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) activation TP53-wt, while
the high-risk group is defined by non-WNT/non-SHH biology. As WNT-activated MB is extremely rare in early
childhood, only young patients (<5 years of age) with low-risk (SHH-activated) MB are eligible and have an
excellent prognosis if treated with either of the two randomized arms in this research study. Craniospinal
irradiation (CSI) is an integral component in the treatment of MB; however, because of the devastating impact
upon the central nervous system (CNS) and neurocognitive outcomes, it must be avoided whenever possible
given the significant interference with educational and vocational attainment. Consequently, maintaining or
improving neurocognitive and QoL functioning is an essential opportunity for early childhood survivors who can
now be cured with treatment that does not include CSI. The Prospective International SIOPE/CONNECT
phase-III study to improve neurocognitive outcomes in young children with low-risk medulloblastoma
(YCMB-LR) is the first ever randomized study directly comparing two highly effective irradiation-sparing
treatment regimens, Head Start 4 and HIT-SKK, which will take place at pediatric oncology centers across
Europe and North America and is the first to include neuropsychological and QoL outcome as the primary
objective. Aim 1) Compare the overall intelligence and IQ subdomains as measured by the Wechsler Preschool
and Primary Scale of Intelligence administered 2.5 years after diagnosis between patients with newly diagnosed,
non-metastatic, SHH-activated, TP53-wt MB randomized to the interventional arms A (Head Start 4) or B (HIT-
SKK). Aim 2) Compare the trajectory between the two randomized groups at baseline and again at 2.5 years
post diagnosis for: a) overall intelligence and IQ subdomains, b) behavioral development and c) QoL, along with
analyses at 2.5 years post diagnosis for: d) fine motor dexterity and processing speed, e) visual-motor
integration, f) executive functioning, and g) social-emotional functioning. Aim 3) Several quantitative imaging
metrics with regard to brain volumes and white matter injury will serve as ancillary noninvasive biomarkers for
comparison of the two interventional arms in Aim 1, and will be statistically correlated with the neurocognitive,
QoL and behavioral outcomes in Aim 2. Impact: Our work will define the new “gold standard” of treatment in
early childhood low-risk MB that is associated with better neurocognitive outcomes with less severe late-effects
and ultimately yield a better QoL in survivorship, while simultaneously improving and harmonizing international
diagnostic and therapeutic standards not only for MB, but also for other pediatric CNS tumors."

The bunyavirus order (Bunyavirales) includes significant human, animal, and plant pathogens. As with all
segmented viruses, reassortment is a major driver of bunyavirus evolution. Reassortment can produce viruses
with undesirable phenotypes, including the ability to infect new hosts. As the world becomes increasingly
interconnected and disrupted by climate change, the opportunity for previously isolated bunyaviruses to meet
and reassort is increasing.
Compatibility between the proteins and RNAs of two viruses is a key determinant of whether they can produce
viable reassortant progeny. And, because reassortment joins proteins and RNAs that have not adapted to work
together, new reassortants face an uphill evolutionary battle when competing with their parents and other
viruses in the population. This proposal will generate an improved mechanistic understanding of molecular
barriers to reassortment and investigate evolutionary pathways that permit reassortants to emerge despite
initial fitness disadvantages.
We have devised a new system that uses libraries of competing minigenomes to quantify reassortment
potential between large numbers of viruses simultaneously, and to define the molecular breakdown in cases
when they can’t. Using these “minigenome melees” in concert with traditional techniques, we propose to
answer targeted questions about the molecular compatibility between bunyaviruses. Our team combines
expertise in viral genomics, molecular virology, mosquito infection, and virus evolution.
In aim 1, we identify steps in the viral lifecycle that break down when bunyavirus replication proteins are
mismatched and perform directed evolution experiments that force mismatched proteins to adapt to work
together. This will explain a key constraint on bunyavirus reassortment and detail molecular interactions at the
heart of the bunyavirus life cycle. In aim 2, we use our minigenome melee system to test the hypothesis that
orthobunyavirus reassortment is relatively unconstrained by packaging. In aim 3, we test the hypothesis that
bottlenecks associated with replication in mosquitoes enable less fit reassortant genotypes to gain a foothold in
populations via the stochastic effect of genetic drift.
At the conclusion of this project, we expect to have a substantially improved understanding of the molecular
rules that determine whether two bunyaviruses can reassort, the fitness consequences of reassortment, and
the evolutionary pathways by which reassortant viruses emerge. Our results could be used to parameterize
models that predict bunyavirus emergence risk and will shed light on conserved interactions that could be
targeted by antiviral drugs. Minigenome melees could in principle be used to study the biology and evolution of
all kinds of RNA viruses, and we expect this work to establish this as a broadly useful platform."

 Lp(a) is a highly prevalent, independent, genetic and likely causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
The population at risk represents 20-30% of individuals in the United States, or >100,000,000 people, and an
estimated 1.4 billion people globally. Lp(a) is associated with increased CVD risk in primary prevention settings
and in patients on statins and PCSK9 inhibitors in secondary prevention settings. Lp(a) is a preferential carrier of
OxPL, the content of which in plasma can be measured by the assay OxPL-apoB. There are no approved
pharmacological therapies to treat elevated Lp(a). In primary prevention settings, clinical equipoise exists in the
use of aspirin in adults with elevated Lp(a) (>30 mg/dL or >75 nmol/L), and physicians do not have enough
information to treat such patients with aspirin, particularly those with a strong family history of CVD. We hypothesize
that elevated Lp(a) will identify a large subgroup of individuals that may benefit from aspirin in primary prevention
settings and propose to test this hypothesis in the ASPREE and ASCEND trials. We propose to test the hypothesis
that aspirin modifies the risk of incident atherothrombotic CVD events in high-risk primary prevention settings to a
different extent in people with high Lp(a) or OxPL-apoB levels than in people with lower Lp(a) levels. SubAim 1 will
test this hypothesis in elderly individuals in the ASPREE trial. SubAim 2 will test this hypothesis in individuals with
type 2 diabetes in the ASCEND trial. We will also perform a meta-analyses of the effects of aspirin on the risk of
incident atherothrombotic CVD events in high-risk primary prevention settings in people with high versus lower
Lp(a) levels and in people with high versus lower OxPL-apoB levels in the ASPREE and ASCEND trials, using the
most comprehensive relevant outcome in each trial, as used in Aim 1 and Aim 2."

In 2020, 10% of U.S. infants were born preterm and ~2%, or 60,000 infants, were born very preterm (VPI; <32
weeks PMA). VPI infants are at high risk for of substantial medical complications, including necrotizing
enterocolitis (NEC). In VPI, advancing and maintaining nutritional support reduces disease risk and improves
neurodevelopmental outcomes; however, up to 25% of preterm infants demonstrate feeding intolerance, which
may be benign or may progress to NEC. However, precise measures and clinical tools that reliably differentiate
benign, intestinal immaturity from life-threatening symptoms are lacking. Therefore, the overall objective of this
application is to establish intestinal host and microbial biomarkers of intestinal function from an existing,
longitudinal, prospective cohort of 400 analyzable VPI and to relate those biomarkers to the spectrum of intestinal
function, from consistent enteral nutrition tolerance to intermittent intolerance to ischemic injury. For this purpose,
we will utilize our novel non-invasive (exfoliated mucosal cell) methodology to simultaneously assess host-
microbiome interactions in the VPI gut. Our central hypothesis is that the transgenomic cross-talk between
intestinal mucosal cells and the fecal metagenome and metabolome will provide mechanistic insight into the
spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from normal gut developmental biology to abnormal pathophysiology.
Three specific aims will test our central hypothesis. Aim 1 will annotate the host exfoliated mucosal cell
transcriptome and fecal bacterial metagenome and metabolome profiles to identify biomarkers for preterm infants
who have consistent tolerance to enteral feeding or who are diagnosed with feeding intolerance. Aim 2 will
annotate the host exfoliated mucosal cell transcriptome and fecal bacterial metagenome and metabolome
profiles to identify biomarkers for preterm infants who are diagnosed with feeding intolerance compared to those
who develop ischemia. Aim 3 will utilize machine learning algorithms to construct putative diet-health outcome
driven Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Completion of these aims will provide the necessary data to develop
predictive algorithms to enable identification of at-risk VPI who would benefit from precision medicine/nutrition
guided interventions targeting specific risk factors."

Despite the tremendous effort to minimize the impacts of malaria in southern Africa, it has yet to be eliminated
from this region. Many understudied mosquito vector species inhabit this area and may be perpetuating
malaria transmission in this pre-elimination zone. Anopheles squamosus is one of the most abundantly caught
mosquito species in southern Zambia. This species is also frequently infected with Plasmodium falciparum, a
causal agent of human malaria, leading to the hypothesis that it is a critical vector of malaria transmission in
Zambia. A major barrier of testing this hypothesis and studying An. squamosus is the lack of genetic
information. In addition to this barrier, An. squamosus is indistinguishable from An. cydippis in the adult stage,
making it difficult to establish links between genotypes to phenotypes important for parasite transmission and
vector control, including vector competence, insecticide resistance, and host preference. This study addresses
these two key barriers by (1) producing high-quality genomes of An. squamosus and An. cydippis, (2)
identifying genetic polymorphisms within An. squamosus, and (3) producing gene annotation of An.
squamosus genome. The genome of An. squamosus will facilitate the identification of species-specific markers
for a diagnostic assay that can be used to distinguish this species from other mosquitoes. Our project will
catalyze the study of An. squamosus and other understudied malaria vectors, as well as their impacts on
malaria transmission. The new genomic resources for An. squamosus can be leveraged for studying mosquito
vector behavior and devise effective control strategies of understudied malaria vectors in pre-elimination
settings."
10888996,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The epidermis forms a multi-layered epithelium that serves as a protective shield for the body, preventing
dehydration and pathogen invasion. Its principal cellular constituents, keratinocytes, continually regenerate the
cutaneous barrier via a specialized form of differentiation as they move outward in the tissue. At the end of
their life in the skin’s outermost layers, keratinocytes initiate a cellular remodeling program called cornification
in which they eliminate their organelles to form flattened, keratinized cells. The importance of this process is
underscored by many disorders of cornification linked to defective keratinocyte maturation. Despite the advent
of biologic treatments for inflammatory skin diseases, development of similar targeted therapies for epidermal
barrier dysfunction has been limited by an incomplete understanding of the pathways driving keratinocyte
differentiation. The proposed aims address this knowledge gap by applying advanced microscopy, gene
editing, and optogenetics to define the mechanisms mediating organelle degradation in human epidermis.
 This proposal builds on the PI’s K08 project, which found that cornifying keratinocytes induce autophagy, a
lysosomal degradation pathway, to break down organelles. The K08-funded work showed that differentiating
keratinocytes upregulate an autophagy receptor, NIX, which marked mitochondria and instructed cells in the
upper tissue layers to break down these organelles, a step that was essential for epidermal maturation. Our
planned experiments will expand the K08 project scope to include the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), testing the
hypothesis that keratinocytes utilize distinct autophagy receptors to orchestrate breakdown of the ER (called
reticulophagy). Aim 1 will determine how reticulophagy drives programmed ER degradation during cornification
and Aim 2 will assess if reticulophagy mitigates damage from ER stress in keratinocytes. Preliminary studies
identified candidate receptors that initiate reticulophagy in either a constitutive manner during cornification or
upon organelle injury due to ER stress. We will use gain- and loss-of-function approaches in organotypic skin
to determine the role of these receptors in directing epidermal morphogenesis and mitigating ER stress. As
well, we will leverage live biosensor imaging and optogenetic tools to define how reticulophagy alters signaling
mediators that control keratinocyte differentiation, including calcium and reactive oxygen species. Results from
the planned work promise to identify novel strategies for normalizing epidermal differentiation in disorders of
cornification but also for repairing barrier dysfunction in common diseases like atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.
 Augmenting the investment by the University of Washington to ensure his success as a physician-scientist,
R03 funding will advance the PI’s career development and position him to compete for R01-level funding as he
transitions to an independent investigator. The proposed project enhances the PI’s expertise at the intersection
of cell biology and dermatology, building an innovative research program that complements his clinical
specialty and provides a platform for future translational work to find novel treatments for skin barrier disorders."

 The overarching framework for this MIT/DFCI Center for Systems Biology of Glioblastoma is to use systems
biology to define the dynamic evolution of the tumor-microenvironment interface, focusing on the development
of symbiotic relationships between tumor cells and neurons and tumor cells and immune cells, with the ultimate
goal of using this systems-level molecular characterization to define novel therapeutic strategies to abrogate
tumor progression and overcome therapeutic resistance in brain tumors. While this CSBC Center is focused on
defining the networks and pathways regulating progression, invasion, and immunosuppression in brain tumors,
these issues are highly relevant for most solid tumors, including some of the most aggressive tumor types. Thus,
we envision this CSBC will serve as a nexus for collaborations focused on this topic, and one of the key functions
of the Administrative Core will be to actively cultivate these collaborations. These activities will extend both to
collaborations between institutions involved in the MIT/DFCI CSBC and collaborations across the U54 and U01
holders within the CSBC network. The central work for this CSBC Center revolves around extensive analysis of
bio-specimens that are created by the Biospecimens Core and shared between Projects 1 and 2. The Analytical
Core provides ultra-deep multi-‘omic characterization of biospecimens and other samples, providing data to both
Projects that can then be modeled within each project and across both projects. This highly integrated analysis
of biospecimens will be actively managed by the Administrative Core to ensure a smooth experimental flow.
Finally, this Core will organize and manage the activities of the Center Advisory Committee, the external advisory
board, and interactions with NCI staff."

An antigen test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng) that is accurate, simple, scalable, non-invasive, rapid, and
effective at the point-of-care (POC), would transform public health decisions. Although antigen detection rapid
diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT's) for Ng are available, they have poor sensitivity (50% or less) compared to gold
standard nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT). A NAAT based POC test was recently cleared by the US FDA,
however its use in resource-poor settings is limited by its high cost. To overcome these barriers for the first time,
we will harness ultrabright fluorescent nanoconstructs, called plasmonic-fluors, a recent breakthrough from our
labs that enables such antigen testing with sensitivity that matches NAATs. The objective of this proposal is to
develop an ultrasensitive plasmon-enhanced lateral flow assay (p-LFA) that detects the lipoprotein H.8 antigen
present on Ng surface. The rationale underlying this proposal is that a highly sensitive Ag-RDT that can match
the accuracy of NAAT could meet the critical need for diagnosing Ng infection at the POC and in resource-limited
settings. We will achieve this by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Develop and optimize the p-LFA for detecting
Ng lipoprotein H.8 antigen in urine samples obtained from healthy people. 2) Determine the diagnostic accuracy
of the Ng antigen test compared to gold standard NAAT in urine specimens from patients with suspected Ng
infection. The proposed approach is innovative in that it harnesses plasmonic-fluor as a fluorescent nanolabel in
a LFA as opposed to the conventional gold nanoparticles, which provide only a weak colorimetric signal. With
over 1000-fold improvement in sensitivity, this approach has the potential to transform antigen testing. The
proposed research is significant as the novel p-LFA will meet the critical needs for widespread Ng testing
scalability, speed, and low cost. The expected outcome of this work is a simple, non-invasive, Ag- RDT for Ng
infection, implemented as a LFA that can replace NAAT by virtue of its accuracy and low cost in resource-limited
settings. This test will have a tremendous positive impact immediately as it will be applicable to large scale Ng
testing with an inexpensive test strip and minimal battery-powered portable equipment, without relying on skilled
personnel. Furthermore, this test will serve as a prototype for ultrasensitive antigen tests applicable to many
other infectious diseases in addition to the possibility of incorporating multiple antigens on a LFA for diagnosing
other sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and trichomoniasis in addition to Ng."
10893427,"Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) play key roles in numerous cellular processes. A classic example is alternative
splicing, where the large megadalton spliceosome complex removes intron regions from the pre-messenger
RNA (pre-mRNA) and re-joins the exons to form the mature mRNA in the nucleus. The spliceosome consists
of protein and non-coding RNA components. Its assembly includes intricate maturation steps that are highly
regulated to ensure that the correct mature mRNA molecules are produced at the right time in healthy cells.
Achieving correct splicing of all mRNAs is subject to intense regulation, requiring a sophisticated interplay of
cellular cues and spatiotemporal dynamics of splicing components. Genetic mutations or environmental
stressors are perturbations that may affect the splicing process and outcomes. These are linked to human
disease states like cancer and neurological diseases. Together, the central role of complex spatiotemporal
RNA dynamics for proper splicing calls for the need to interrogate diverse RNAs live on a subcellular level over
time. The complexity of RNA species involved in splicing requires robust and versatile labeling strategies to
visualize multiple RNA molecules simultaneously and relative to other biological molecules of interest. A key
goal of this research program is to develop such a robust toolbox for multiplexed RNA visualization using
advanced fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) emerges as a
particularly versatile approach, as it is compatible with adding sophisticated imaging modalities. A central
feature that will be included in the proposed work is the ability to visualize multiple RNAs simultaneously,
including small non-coding RNAs with roles in splicing. More broadly, these RNA imaging tools will allow
researchers across different fields to investigate RNAs in a variety of relevant cell model systems. Alternative
splicing has been linked to formation of a type of cytosolic RNA-protein granules, called U-bodies.
Spliceosome RNAs (called U snRNAs) are the defining components of U-bodies, along with several proteins
that are implicated in the splicing reaction. U-bodies were observed across different cellular models, pointing to
a central role in gene regulation, but details about their precise composition and function remain elusive. This
research program will combine targeted investigation of U-bodies and the newly developed multiplexed RNA
fluorescence tagging tools to delineate mechanistic roles of U-bodies. U-body compositions and their
subcellular dynamics upon perturbation will be defined to delineate underlying cellular mechanisms. A possible
link between U-body dynamics and alternative splicing regulation will be investigated. As a long-term goal, the
role of U-bodies in splicing dynamics and regulation may be expanded upon across biological cell systems and
perturbations, revealing a previously unknown new layer of gene regulation. U-body components have been
linked with several human disease states, indicating that insights from this research program may shed light on
possible treatment and disease management strategies of human health in the future."
10903802,"The development of scalable, cost-effective antibody libraries for detecting proteins (or other molecules) has
greatly lagged the development of methods for detecting (e.g. by hybridization or sequencing) specific RNA or
DNA sequences. If we were able to engineer antibodies against diverse targets and create large-scale libraries
of barcoded antibodies that could be detected by nucleic acid hybridization or sequencing, many applications
would be enabled to empower the cancer research community, including high-dimensional cell cytometry (similar
to CITE-seq), spatially-indexed sequencing (e.g. using Slide-seq, MERFISH, etc), in situ sequencing to detect
antibodies bound to targets (similar to CODEX) and targeted proteomics (such as the Olink proximity extension
assay). These applications currently rely on laborious and expensive barcoding of individual (commercial)
antibodies, followed by pooling for parallel detection. Here, we propose to develop a novel strategy to discover,
engineer and apply synthetic VHH-domain nanobodies against hundreds to thousands of human protein targets
simultaneously, thus enabling creation of sequence-defined antibodies and enabling rapid production of pools of
barcoded-antibodies at large scale by any investigator. Our proposal builds novel methods that leverage our
recently developed cell-free platform for producing large libraries of distinct nanobodies (with an input library of
1011-1012 complexity) that are barcoded with their encoding RNA by ribosome display. We will develop methods
to use these libraries for parallel selection of nanobodies that bind each of hundreds (to thousands) of cell surface
proteins (i.e. a many-to-many screen) in cancer cells. Our approach combines cell-free nanobody engineering,
ectopic ORF expression or CRISPR/Cas9 knockout, with single cell sequencing to achieve generation of
nanobodies against a large number of targets in parallel. Importantly, by analyzing many targets at once, our
approach for the first time validates nanobody specificity at scale by measuring off-target binding systematically
for each nanobody to ensure binding specificity. We envision that the resulting methods for discovering and
using nanobodies against cancer cell surface molecules would enable highly multiplexed single cell and spatial
tissue proteomics. Building on the proposed proof of principle, one can envision the platform enabling any lab to
develop sequence-defined novel detection reagents and highly multiplexed libraries of detection reagents
against conventional and unconventional targets across many projects of high value to cancer research."

Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a new tracer imaging technology that could soon allow MDs to tell
whether a CAR-T cell immunotherapy is actually targeting a tumor— with zero radiation, and in just
3 days. This is much safer and much faster than today’s practice of a followup PET/CT, which is too
slow to allow for personalized immunotherapy care. MPI uses no radiation and yet it matches even the
sensitivity of advanced nuclear medicine scans. MPI could soon revolutionize the early diagnosis of
life-threatening Strokes, Traumatic Brain Injuries, Cardiovascular disease, Pulmonary Embolisms (PE),
Gastrointestinal (GI) Bleeds and Cancer. In essence, MPI offers the the sensitivity of Nuclear Medicine
with the safety of MRI. MPI is quantitative and robust everywhere in the body and it uses no radiation.
MPI also is ideal for emergency diagnoses because MPI tracers can be bound to a targeting agent in
the factory and then injected directly from the refrigerator. Hence, emergency MPI scans can be done
in just 5 minutes with MPI, much faster than the 2 hours typical for nuclear medicine scans.
 We aim to remove the only technical weakness holding back MPI from clinical adoption, its weak
spatial resolution. Our key innovation is to improve the spatial resolution of MPI by 10-fold in each di-
mension. Our innovations span hardware, pulse sequences, reconstruction algorithms and the nanoscale
physics and chemistry of innovative high-resolution MPI tracers. Our preliminary experiments show 10-
fold (routinely) and 30-fold (occasionally) boost in resolution and SNR compared to the MPI standard,
VivoTrax. Once our new tracers are made biocompatible they will pave the way for unprecedented 10-
cell sensitivity at 2mm resolution in humans with a safe and affordable human MPI scanner, at roughly
$100,000 hardware costs—a truly enabling advance.
 Our Specific Aims are to (1) Develop high-resolution MPI tracers shared between Industry and
Academia; (2) Develop Engineering Tools for High Resolution MPI shared between academia and
industry; and (3) In vivo scanning to prove the efficacy of high-resolution MPI.
 This Bioengineering Partnership with Industry is the ideal mechanism to foster this breakthrough in
MPI resolution by a collaboration between three labs at UC Berkeley and a startup out of the PI’s lab
(Magnetic Insight)."

Inflammation is required for both pathogen clearance and tissue repair. Mucosal tissues are in continuous
contact with the external environment, making these sites highly vulnerable to infection and tissue damage from
a variety of sources. Damage can occur as a result of both external insults and the ensuing inflammatory
cascade. Therefore, robust responses are required to both dampen inflammation and repair damaged tissue.
Epithelial repair is known to occur through local stem and progenitor populations, however, the interplay between
the epithelium and immune cells within the local microenvironment is more enigmatic. One such cell type, the
macrophage, plays important roles in immune surveillance, repair, and homeostasis across multiple tissues.
However, the direct role of macrophages in epithelial regeneration is not well understood. In my laboratory over
the next several years, we will interrogate the role of macrophages in regulating inflammatory responses and
promoting tissue repair and remodeling. More specifically, we are interested in deciphering macrophage-
epithelial cell interactions following viral and chemical damage in mucosal tissues to identify novel regulators of
repair. We will use both in vivo damage models and ex vivo organoid systems to: 1) determine how macrophages
regulate inflammatory responses to promote host survival and 2) define how macrophages mediate tissue repair
through communication with epithelial cells.
The long-term goal of my research program is to expand our knowledge surrounding immune cell functions in
tissue repair and remodeling in barrier tissues. Our proposed interdisciplinary approaches at the interface
between innate immunity and regenerative medicine will bring fresh insight to biological problems at the center
of many complex diseases. Understanding the reparative capacity of immune cell populations will allow
development of new therapeutic strategies to dampen pathological inflammatory responses, enhance repair
following infection and injury, and decrease the pathological tissue remodeling associated with many disease
states."

Malaria affects three billion people worldwide. Despite remarkable reductions in malaria incidence over the last
15 years, recent evidence shows that our traditional control tools are weakening. Long-lasting insecticide-treated
bednets (LLINs) are the most widely used tool for malaria prevention and have contributed significantly to de-
creases in malaria incidence, but recent studies suggest that LLINs are either less effective than before or people
are not using them as reported. A rigorous assessment of the timing and circumstances of LLIN use could be
vitally important to regain the initiative in malaria control, but we lack a reliable measure of LLIN use. Current
measurement tools, like self-reported use, are subjective and unable to account for temporal variations in use. I
previously invented an electronic monitor of LLIN use to address these limitations. In my NIAID-funded K23 work
we use these tools to measure LLIN use related to malaria exposure. Most recently, I have pioneered a vastly
improved approach using machine learning algorithms and accelerometer-based sensors to measure LLIN use.
The central rationale for this project is that by leveraging this novel accelerometer LLIN use monitor we can be
more ambitious with our goals for measuring malaria risk related to LLINs. When combined with a carefully
trained machine learning algorithm, I believe that we can accurately classify a far wider range of behaviors than
merely when an LLIN is used. In this study, we will additionally 1) measure if there is someone under the LLIN,
2) determine how many people are under the LLIN, 3) identify interruptions in LLIN use (such as entering or
exiting an LLIN), and 4) characterize who is under the LLIN (e.g. adult versus child). Longitudinal surveillance of
exactly this type of data is crucial to disentangle the role of LLINs in malaria prevention. The immediate goal of
this R21 proposal is to train a comprehensive platform for highly accurate remote monitoring of LLIN use and
other behaviors related to malaria risk. Our approach thus gathers data from the community, trains a machine
learning algorithm and then tests the real-life accuracy of that system. We will pursue our research goal by with
these three aims: 1) gather real-life data about how LLINs are hung and used in the community, 2) train the
machine learning algorithms based off pre-defined protocols informed by actual practice and 3) test the accuracy
of the machine learning algorithms in real-life settings. This high-risk, high-reward proposal represents an inno-
vative approach to answer a pressing question that limits our understanding of how LLINs prevent malaria: when
and how are LLINs used in practice? The long term goal for this novel surveillance platform is to develop a tool
for measuring LLIN use and related behaviors to point the way towards identifying better interventions for malaria
prevention. The single accelerometer and generality in the training of the machine were purposefully chosen to
facilitate adoption of this approach for malaria surveillance in other settings. This proposal will establish a firm
foundation upon which to pursue future research studies using this novel tool and prepare me for an independent
research career using novel technologies and research methods to improve malaria control."

10729506,"Behavioral health (BH) conditions, including mental health and substance use disorders, remain common and
persistent among Veterans Health Administration (VHA) patients. Several VHA key priority areas coincide with
BH conditions, including disability, overdose, suicide, and women's health. VHA remains a national leader in
providing high-quality BH treatment and serves as an early responder to policies and programs designed to
improve health and wellbeing for individuals experiencing these conditions. VHA must develop and evaluate
new strategies to manage and resolve the complicated array of problems facing Veterans with BH conditions and
their providers.
Kara Zivin, PhD, MS, MA has focused on improving VHA BH services using used mixed methods research and
evaluation approaches. The three primary thematic aims of her work include: 1) to continue research to evaluate
the impacts of health policies and system initiatives on outcomes among Veterans with BH conditions, leading
to intervention development, implementation, dissemination, and targeted policymaking; 2) to extend research
to improve Veteran functional outcomes including disability and employment among those with BH conditions
and enhance VHA clinician wellbeing; and 3), to develop and lead women's health research to improve Veterans'
perinatal BH. These three thematic areas directly relate to positive treatment outcomes, including overall
function and wellbeing, and reducing the likelihood of adverse events among Veterans with BH conditions.
Dr. Zivin's has demonstrated her contributions to these areas through her externally funded research with
support from VA Health Services Research and Development (HSR&D), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and
Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) among others in addition to over 160 peer-
reviewed scientific publications. Dr. Zivin has actively mentored ten early career investigators and/or trainees
within the VA and has served in key leadership and service roles locally within the Ann Arbor VA Center of
Innovation (COIN) and nationally within the VHA.
Given her active and productive research portfolio and demonstrated commitment to mentoring colleagues in
developing VHA research careers, Dr. Zivin is a strong candidate for a Health Services Research Career Scientist
Award. The proposed Research Career Scientist Award will support her continued research, an expanded role in
mentorship and training of the next generation of HSR&D researchers, and targeted VHA service designed to
enhance and extend the reach and impact of her research and mentoring. Her research portfolio has the potential
to address some of the most critical and vexing BH-related priorities in VHA and improve care for some of the
most challenging and highest-risk Veterans treated within the VHA system."
10873263,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lupus nephritis (LN) is seen in ~50% of individuals with the chronic autoimmune disease systemic lupus
erythematosus and is a serious cause of morbidity in this disease, with ~10% of SLE cases leading to end stage
renal disease within 5 years of diagnosis. LN occurs disproportionately in women of non-European ancestry,
including African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians, and despite many years of study, there are few targeted
treatments. The recent approval of the first two specific LN therapeutics, belimumab and voclosporin targeting
adaptive immune cells (T and B cells), was an important milestone. However, these therapeutics only have ~40%
efficacy. Thus, a major challenge in the field is to identify therapies that treat or prevent LN in all patients. There
is growing evidence that innate immune cells also contribute to LN. In particular, non-classical, patrolling
monocytes have recently been implicated in glomerulonephritis, suggesting that a novel innate immune
mechanism through recruitment of patrolling monocytes to the kidney contributes to LN, and that interfering with
accumulation of patrolling monocytes early in disease could be therapeutically efficacious. There are no existing
therapies that specifically target patrolling monocyte accumulation in the kidney, or other organs, thus, a better
understanding of the genes and mechanisms that drive this process holds promise for identifying new therapeutic
targets for LN and is the focus of this proposal. Informed by human lupus genetic risk loci, we will define key
genes involved in patrolling monocyte accumulation in the kidney in LN. Though many genetic risk variants have
been identified as associated with increased risk for SLE, the function of most genes regulated by these variants
have not been systematically assessed in innate immune cells such as monocytes. We hypothesize that genes
associated with GWAS risk variants may serve as a rich source of regulators of patrolling monocyte accumulation
in glomerular capillaries and therefore of LN. To understand how genetic risk loci contribute to patrolling
monocyte accumulation in LN, we will use an in vivo CRISPR screen using the TLR7.1 mouse model of lupus-
like disease with validation in additional mouse lupus models. Upon completion, we will illuminate genes and
pathways that may be targeted by novel therapeutic interventions, which could be used prior to the onset of
kidney nephritis. Additionally, risk haplotypes correlated with identified genes could help predict the efficacy of
such therapeutic approaches as well as risk for LN."
10903997,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD) among women giving birth in US hospitals increased by 131%
from 2010-2017. This corresponds directly to the 82% increase in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS)
diagnoses in the same period, up to 7/1000 hospital births.1,2 Despite the need for maternal OUD treatment,
referrals from postpartum units and neonatal intensive care units (NICU) to OUD treatment are low and
postpartum treatment dropout is high among those who were treated prenatally.3 Infants born to women with
OUD are often sent to NICUs after birth to manage opioid withdrawal, with their mothers at their bedside during
their stay. An infant's NICU stay therefore represents a critical period in which to diagnose maternal OUD, initiate
treatment, and refer for ongoing care in a setting that prioritizes and preserves maternal-infant dyadic bonding.
 Despite recommendations to integrate maternal mental health screenings and referrals in pediatric settings
and a global move towards integrated mental health and substance abuse treatment in adult healthcare settings,
limited information exists on how to close the gap in maternal mental health and substance abuse treatment in
pediatric settings. The major challenge we aim to address is the need for adult treatment to occur in a pediatric
treatment setting where structures do not yet exist to make this feasible. The goals of this study are 1) to
systematically identify the primary facilitators and barriers to implementing bedside OUD treatment in the NICU
through in-depth interviews with mothers, NICU providers, and other stakeholders; 2) to use steps from
implementation mapping to develop a suite of implementation strategies to collocate buprenorphine induction for
postpartum women with OUD in the NICU based on feedback from Aim 1; and 3) to refine, test, and examine
the acceptability and feasibility of applying the adapted model in a pilot case series in two NICU sites for use in
larger trials. This process will allow us to deliver a treatment model and set of implementation strategies for
providing evidence-based OUD treatment to postpartum mothers in NICUs that will enhance its accessibility and
sustainability. Future goals include testing the intervention and implementation strategies in a subsequent hybrid
effectiveness- implementation study to estimate the extent to which they lead to improved implementation,
sustained treatment, and outcomes for new mothers with OUD."
10894097,"Rational PROTAC design enabled by integrated in silico molecular modeling and in vitro
 biomimetic affinity assessment
 Proteolysis targeting chimeras, or PROTACs, have received considerable attention in recent years as
a new class of drugs as compared to traditional inhibitors. These small molecules target selective degradation
of proteins of interest utilizing cell’s native protein degradation machinery including proteosomes and
lysosomes. The benefits of PROTACs stem from an entirely different paradigm of protein targeting, which
provides a unique path to target previously “undruggable” proteins and allows for smaller doses and thus
lower side-effects. However, the complex mechanism of action has left a large knowledge gap towards the
understanding of molecular interactions in different stages, especially on factors that control and stabilize the
ternary complex that leads to ubiquitination and removal. In addition, existing technology lacks of strategies
to model and confirm the linker region of the PROTAC for their roles in affecting the affinities of the warheads
and contributing to the stability of the complex. There has been no report that includes the dynamic membrane
in molecular recognition modeling. A new technical platform that can identify key parameters that impact
formation of stable ternary complex and has the capability of screening molecular interactions with detailed
information on structural insights is highly desired.
 To fill the unmet need, we propose to develop a collaborative work plan via a combination of in silico
modeling and in vitro surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based affinity assessment. We aim to identify
features that lead to formation of stable ternary complexes for efficient PROTAC design. To establish and
prove the technical feasibility, we will study anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a transmembrane receptor
tyrosine kinase that is an important drug target for a variety of cancers, and an E3 ligase CRBN which has
been used to promote protein degradation. Specifically, we propose three aims: Aim 1. Establish a molecular
modeling platform for rational PROTAC design. The platform incorporates protein dynamics and inputs from
experiments and can adapt various experimental settings such as membrane environment used in SPR. Aim
2. Build and characterize modeled PROTACs and biomimetic membranes. This includes generating
PROTAC-compatible membrane mimics and structural characterization of the interfaces for membrane-bound
proteins for SPR analysis. Aim 3. Investigate interaction properties of PROTAC candidates’ in biomimetic
membranes. This includes on-line in vitro experiments and screening for the PROTACs at stabilizing the
ternary complexes. The identification of stable PROTAC complexes will be used into further exploration into
the understanding of the structure-function relationship of the system."
10729148,"SUMMARY
Between 2000, when the first version of Hypothesis Testing Using Phylogenies (HyPhy) was released, and
2022, the number of bases in GenBank increased ~250 fold, the number of sequenced genomes from a handful
to >3,5003, and the number of PubMed papers studying molecular evolution ~12 fold. Data generation has
ceased to be the bottleneck for biological and biomedical discoveries, and the new bottleneck is methods, tools,
and software for data analysis and interpretation. Comparative evolutionary analyses remain an essential and
powerful method for extracting meaning and insight from ever-expanding genomic sequence data. But, the lack
of emphasis and incentive structure for developing, maintaining, benchmarking, and improving software and
analysis tools, despite their essential and critical role in modern biology, biotechnology, and medicine remains
a major concern. Analytical, infrastructure, and incentive challenges exposed by the genomic data deluge during
the COVID-19 pandemic were aptly summarized. Over the last quarter century HyPhy has established itself as
a useful, popular, and durable platform for studying diverse evolutionary processes, such as natural selection
and recombination, across different taxonomic scales. Datamonkey, a web application providing free access to
“one-click” popular HyPhy analyses, has seen increasing use by researchers worldwide over the last two
decades. Through continued methodological innovation, improvements in performance and scalability,
accessible web services, focus on data visualization, and user support, HyPhy developers were able to sustain
and increase the reach and impact of the program. This proposal seeks to improve the software, enhance
biological realism, relevance, accessibility, and interpretability of the methods, design novel approaches to
address outstanding problems in evolutionary data analysis, and further lower access barriers to evolutionary
comparative analyses through integration with the Galaxy ecosystem."
10892288,"Project Summary
Myeloid immune suppression, driven by macrophages and monocytes, is a known mechanism of intrinsic
resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI), which has provided significant and durable responses in
patients with advanced cancers, but not in most breast cancer patients. Our laboratory has been instrumental in
demonstrating that targeting myeloid immunosuppression via decreasing the function of immature myeloid
derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) is a novel and important strategy to sensitize the tumor
microenvironment (TME) and improve the response to ICIs in breast cancer. We published two preclinical
studies demonstrating that entinostat, a class I histone deacetylase inhibitor, decreased MDSC suppression of
T cells; furthermore, combining entinostat with the ICIs nivolumab and ipilimumab improved survival in murine
models of breast cancer. This provided a strong rationale for our Phase I clinical trial (NCI-9844) where we
determined the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for this treatment, given to patients with advanced solid
tumors, including 10/33 with breast cancer, as a two-week pre-treatment with entinostat, followed by the
combination of entinostat + nivolumab + ipilimumab. Furthermore, an overall response rate (ORR) of 30% was
observed in an expansion cohort of 20 patients with advanced breast cancer, who received the RP2D.
Nevertheless, we have yet to understand how entinostat decreases myeloid suppression to achieve TME
sensitization that leads to this striking response to ICIs.
Preliminary data in preclinical models demonstrate that entinostat 1) decreases suppressive function of intra-
tumoral MDSCs; 2) decreases the activation of the STAT3-NFkB-AP-1 signaling axis; and 3) alters the
phenotype and/or infiltration within the TME of other myeloid cells, including tumor associated macrophages
(TAMs), and dendritic cells (DCs). Preliminary evaluation of patient samples from our clinical trial confirms these
findings. Thus, we hypothesize that entinostat decreases MDSC immunosuppression and shifts the
phenotype and function of TAMs, and DCs to collectively sensitize the TME to promote an enhanced
response to ICIs. The Specific Aims are: 1) to determine the effects of entinostat on the STAT3-NFB-AP-1
axis decreases MDSC-mediated T cell suppression; and 2) to determine the cellular basis of entinostat-induced
sensitization of the TME and how it mediates the anti-tumor response to ICIs. Our unique bidirectional approach
combining preclinical studies, e.g., mouse models and mathematical modeling, with hypothesis-driven
correlative investigations in patients, and vice versa, strengthens our ability to uncover the molecular and TME
mechanisms driving clinical responses. These studies will reveal if changes in myeloid suppression and/or tumor-
immune dynamics inform response to therapy or survival, while identification of new biomarkers may improve
patient stratification for future trials."
10916474,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 With each inhalation, exhalation and across development, maturation, aging and
pathogenesis, the lung is constantly under mechanical tension. How the biophysical force is
sensed and responded to remains poorly understood. In the gas exchange region that bears the
front of this force, tension is distributed across the vast alveolar surface. In this study, we will
investigate the central premise that mechanical tension, sensed by alveolar epithelial cells,
triggers a molecular feedback loop that drives the generation and regeneration of the gas
exchange surface area.
 At the center of this feedback loop is Piezo, a large membrane localized channel that is a
quintessential mechanosensor. First discovered and studied in neurons, Piezo genes are also
widely expressed in the lung. Our preliminary data show that while loss of Piezo genes in the
lung mesenchyme or the endothelium did not lead to discernable alveolar structural defects,
inactivating these genes, especially Piezo2, in the lung epithelium led to alveolar simplification
in the early postnatal lung. In the adult lung, Piezo2 loss in the alveolar epithelium led to
drastically increased susceptibility to alveolar damage, leading to fibrosis. In this study, we will
investigate the nature of this mechanosensory circuit in development (Aim 1) and injury repair
(Aim 2). The findings will advance our knowledge on how mechanosensation could tune the size
and composition of the alveolar surface."
10913566,"Project Summary
Islet glucose-stimulated insulin and somatostatin (SST) secretion are perturbed in patients with type-2 diabetes
(T2D) and in animal models of the disease, which contributes to disrupted glucose homeostasis. It is generally
accepted that secretagogues stimulate hormone secretion from -cells and -cells in response to elevated intra-
cellular Ca2. However, the mechanisms that control inhibition of islet Ca2+ handling via Gi/o-coupled receptors
(Gi/o-GPCRs) and how they are altered in T2D are largely unknown. Data from our lab finds that Gi/o-GPCRs
reduce islet Ca2+ entry via Src tyrosine kinase-mediated activation of Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA), which
hyperpolarizes membrane potential (Δψp) and limits insulin secretion. Further data show that Protein kinase A
(PKA) activation by Gs-coupled receptors inhibits islet NKA activity and stimulates Ca2+ entry. Moreover, we find
that islet SST provides paracrine signaling that slows glucose-stimulated -cell Ca2+ oscillations via oscillations
in NKA activity, which depends on the action of Src tyrosine kinase and PKA. Finally, our preliminary data provide
the first evidence that diabetic conditions diminish islet NKA activity, which contributes to perturbations in glucose
and GPCR control of Ca2+ handling. Based on these exciting preliminary data, the overall objective of this pro-
posal is to elucidate how islet NKA is controlled and becomes disrupted during the pathogenesis of diabetes.
This project will test the central hypothesis that that islet NKA activation by tyrosine kinases limits Ca2+ entry and
hormone secretion through Δψp hyperpolarization; whereas, PKA inhibition of islet NKAs enhances Ca2+ entry
and hormone secretion by depolarizing Δψp. The rationale that underlies this project is that understanding sig-
naling that integrates NKA modulation of islet cell Ca2+ handling and hormone secretion will expose novel thera-
peutic targets for restoring glucose-stimulated hormone secretion in T2D. This project will be accomplished with
the following two specific aims: 1) Determine the mechanisms regulating NKA control of β-cell function in health
and diabetes; and 2) Determine how NKA modulates -cell function and dysfunction. Under the first aim, trans-
genic mice with -cell ablation of the - - and -subunits of the NKA complex subunits as well as human -cells
with knockdown of NKA - - and -subunits will be utilized to assess the roles of NKA during secretagogue and
Gi/o-GPCR modulation of -cell Ca2+ handling and insulin secretion. Aim1 will also determine how diabetic con-
ditions impact NKA signaling and insulin secretion. Under the second aim, NKA control of -cell Ca2+ handling
and function will be determined in mice with -cell specific ablation of NKA - - and -subunits or in human
pseudoislets with -cell specific knockdown of NKA - - and -subunits. Furthermore, Aim2 will determine how
reduced NKA function in -cells under the stressful conditions associated with diabetes contributes to -cell
dysfunction. This project is significant because it is expected to illuminate mechanisms that alter -cell and -cell
Ca2+ handling and disrupt islet hormone secretion in T2D. Moreover, this project plans to identify potential phar-
macological strategies for normalizing islet hormone secretion and reducing islet dysfunction in T2D."

10924008,"Neuronopathic lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases caused by genetic defects in components of the lysosome, which is the major site within the cell for the degradation and recycling of exhausted cellular components. Defective lysosomes accumulate undegraded storage material, which has classically been thought to be toxic for the cell and the driver of the pathogenic cascade of the dis- ease. Recent advances in the investigation of the lysosome, however, have shown that the storage burden it- self can be uncoupled from the most dramatic effects of the disease on the affected organs. Moreover, there are emerging roles of the lysosome as a central player in the regulation of cell metabolism which are distinct from its classical role as a cellular degradation site. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that are the changes in the communication between the lysosome and the rest of the cell, rather than the storage itself, that drive disease pathogenesis. Determining exactly which components of the lysosomal communication network mediate disease propagation, in which cell type, and how, is important because it could unveil the next generation of therapeutic targets. We propose to use innovative genetic tools and artificial intelligence-driven analytical pipelines to mechanistically investigate changes in lysosomal content and communication in the central nervous system of mouse models of two distinct LSDs. In Aim 1 we will catalogue LSD-associated changes in lysosomal content and composition and determine their relationship with LSD-specific cellular features based on the perturbation of components of the broad lysosomal gene metabolic network. In Aim 2 we will investigate the changes in the signaling network that mediates communication of the lysosome with the nucleus and determine the effectors of the cell’s response to lysosomal stress. In Aim 3 we will place the study of lysosomal content, signaling, and dysfunction in the context of specific cell types (neurons, astroglia, macrophages) to determine their role in the initiation and propagation of disease. Results from this study will provide the first atlas of changes in lysosomal content and signaling components in LSDs and will pioneer the integrative study of the lysosome as a multi-level network of causally associated components and pathways. Knowledge resulting from this study could lay the foundation for future translational investigation of treatments for neuronopathic LSDs."
10724263,"Project Summary: Candidate—The following application is intended to initiate the research career of Kristi J.
Warren, PhD within the VA Nebraska Western Iowa Health Care System under the mentorship of [Robert Paine
III, MD; a well-respected, VA-funded pulmonary researcher and clinician for the past 20+ years]. Dr. Warren
received her PhD in Immunobiology in 2012 and has since completed her postdoctoral training focused
exclusively in the pulmonary immunologic sciences. Environment—[The University of Utah is adjacent to the
George E. Wahlen VA Medical Center and research hospital where clinical and scientific relationships have been
established to complete the proposed studies.] The research environment is collegial and supportive with a
multitude of opportunities for interaction with other scientists with similar interests. Specifically, Dr. Warren will
have every opportunity to discuss/present her work for crucial feedback and direction from senior VA
researchers. Research—In recent years, asthma and other chronic respiratory illnesses are increasingly
diagnosed in the Veteran population. There is a sex-based disparity in asthma such that severe asthma is more
prevalent in adult female Veterans than males, and more asthma-linked deaths occur in women than men. In
general, ovarian hormones are thought to contribute to disease exacerbation, whereas testosterone protects
against asthma. Recently, attention was drawn to the group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), which are shown to
produce large amounts of asthma-promoting cytokines (IL-5 and IL-13) following allergen exposure. We
observed a sex difference in activated ILC2 such that lung ILC2 isolated from female allergen-treated mice
produced higher IL-5, IL-13, and the type 2 chemokines, CCL17 and CCL22, in comparison to males. In this
research proposal we will use gonadectomized female mice treated with slow-release hormone pellets to
evaluate the independent effect of estrogen, progesterone, and [testosterone] in experimental asthma. There
are two goals for Aim 1: (1) define sex differences in recruitment and localization of ILC2 in the lung mediated
through the chemokine receptors CCR4 and CRTH2 and their cognate chemokines, CCL17/22 and PGD2,
respectively (subaim 1a). (2) Subaim 1b will define the chemokine expression specifically by activated lung-ILC2
following allergen exposure. Because ILC2 are in close proximity to the airway epithelium and other resident
immune cells, these studies are designed to separate the sex hormone effect on the total chemokine milieu of
the lung from that of the activated ILC2. These studies will comprehensively define the sex hormone-based
effects on the chemokine milieu developed in the lung during allergen challenge. Aim 2 will investigate sex
differences in IL-33-mediated activation of ILC2, which drives the production of IL-5 and IL-13 through a MyD88-
dependent signaling pathway. IL-33-MyD88 signaling has not been previously evaluated in ILC2, nor has the
effect of sex hormones on IL-33 signaling been established. In subaim 2a we will examine the mechanism by
which sex hormones alter IL-33-induced activation of ILC2 in mice, and in subaim 2b we will isolate ILC2 from
the blood of healthy and asthmatic, female and male Veteran donors to translate our findings to Veteran
population. Aim 3 will similarly examine male and female γC-dependent signaling mechanisms in mouse and
human ILC2. Our preliminary data from human ILC2 suggests that female ILC2 proliferate more efficiently than
male ILC2 when stimulated with IL-2 and IL-7, γC-dependent cytokines. Because γC is required for ILC2 survival
and proliferation, we will evaluate JAK-STAT and PI3K-TOR activation for interactions with the sex hormones
following IL-2 and IL-7 stimulation. The scope of this project is such that novel signaling mechanisms can be
defined, leading to personalized therapeutic strategies designed to more effectively limit the asthma burden in
the highly susceptible Veteran population. Furthermore, this project will effectively launch the independent
scientific career of the candidate within the VA medical-research community."
10724264,"Dr. Lau is an internationally recognized investigator in the Y chromosome biology and an established
expert in molecular genetics and transgenic mouse modeling of human diseases. He has established various
molecular tools in his laboratory, installed advanced next generation sequencing equipment and bioinformatics
in the Molecular Core, and served as consultant for PIs interested in such advanced technologies at the SFVA.
Currently, he has several established and pilot projects. First project focuses on the roles of the Y-located
proto-oncogene TSPY in liver and prostate cancers. TSPY is the gene for the gonadoblastoma locus on the Y
chromosome (GBY), the only oncogenic locus on this male-specific chromosome. Normally, it functions as a
male germ stem cell factor, but as an oncogene when ectopically expressed in somatic cells, such as prostate
epithelial cells and hepatocytes. It stimulates cell proliferation and cyclin B-CDK1 kinase activities. TSPY forms
a positive feedback loop with male sex hormone receptor AR and constitutively active variant AR-V7, thereby
amplifying their respective oncogenic actions. Research centers on exploring the correlation between TSPY,
AR/AR-V7 expression and clinical features and outcomes in liver and prostate cancers; and on studying
experimentally the contributions of TSPY and AR/AR-V7 in oncogenesis in liver and prostate cancer. Validation
of the roles of TSPY in AR/AR-V7 in the male-dominance in liver cancer could offer immediate translational
applications of effective anti-AR/AR-V7 drugs already developed for prostate cancer to the treatment of liver
cancer. The second project focuses on the X-located homologue of TSPY, TSPX on human oncogenesis. Due
to evolutionary divergence, TSPX possesses contrasting properties, i.e. retards cell proliferation, inhibits cyclin
B-CDK1 and AR/AR-V7 transactivation activities, and behaves as a tumor suppressor in various cancers,
including lung, liver and prostate cancers. Studies are designed to identify their respective oncogenic and
tumor suppressor domains, and signaling pathways in oncogenesis. The third project focuses on the genes on
the male-specific region of the Y chromosome (MSY) in sex differences in various physiology and diseases.
The current emphasis is on the sex-determining gene SRY, which is essential for sex determination, but not for
the development of non-gonadal tissues. Dr. Lau has established an efficient transgene activation system and
demonstrated that aberrant expression of a human SRY induces various abnormalities in transgenic mice,
including retardation in neurogenesis and postnatal lung development, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and
myocardial infarction. Studies are being conducted to characterize the mechanisms of diseases, mediated by
aberrant SRY expression in the respective tissues. The fourth project focuses on the recently observed link
between mosaic loss of the Y chromosome (mLOY) in the peripheral blood and increased risks and mortality in
elderly men. In collaborations with Health Research scientists at SFVA, Dr. Lau plans to explore the possibility
of using mLOY as screening tool for cancers and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases among the
Veterans, such as the databases of the Million Veteran Program (MVP). He hypothesizes that mLOY results in

Numerous aging-associated neurodegenerative diseases are rooted in the misfolding of
proteins and the generation of toxic protein aggregates, with Alzheimer's disease (AD)
being the most prevalent form of dementia characterized by the aggregation of the
amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau. Few effective strategies are
currently available for most of these diseases. In this proposal, we will test the
hypothesis that novel molecular chaperones can be evolved to recognize and target
aggregation-prone proteins and ameliorate their associated toxicity, thus providing a new
approach to intervene in protein misfolding diseases. Using Aβ as the model substrate,
our specific goal is to provide proof-of-principle for a new platform for the directed
evolution of molecular chaperones that can protect Aβ sequences from aggregation. The
efficacy of the evolved chaperones in ameliorating Aβ toxicity will be tested in vitro and
in vivo. The proposed studies will establish a new, facile, and broadly applicable
approach to evolve novel molecular chaperones tailored to specific aggregation-prone
target proteins and thus broadly impact diverse diseases rooted in protein misfolding.
The evolved TMMCs are expected to achieve a specificity that is normally unattainable
by other approaches, such as small molecules or general chaperone upregulation, and
can supplement the reduced capacity of the cellular chaperone network during aging to
protect neuronal cells from toxic protein aggregates."

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of severe visual impairment in people over age
50 in developed countries [1,2]. Transplantation of stem cell derived retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is
currently a promising method to treat retinal degeneration and advanced non-neovascular AMD (NNAMD) [3-
6]. Many protocols have been developed for the derivation of RPE from pluripotent stem cells from human
embryonic stem cells (hESC) or human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) [7-12]. The quality control of
donor cells is a basic requirement for cell production in clinical trials. Stem cell residues and chromosome
number variation during long-term culture must be tested before clinical use. However, quality control for stem
cell residues (pluripotency) and stem cell tumorigenicity is not trivial. Physically removing cells from an RPE
monolayer during culture will result in hypotrophy of the monolayer due to epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) and wound healing. There is an unmet need in the molecular profiling of RPE implants with spatial
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). A focused ultrasound (FUS) offers a solution to this unmet need, as it can
produce ejection of cells via cell-containing liquid droplets from a solid surface with minimum impact on the
edges surrounding the ejection spot. Ultrasound propagates through liquid and solid, and the FUS transducer
does not have to be in physical contact with the substrate where cells are grown. The number of cells that are
ejected by a FUS transducer depends on the focal size of the FUS, which can be very small, and is very
precise and repeatable. Further, it is low-cost and effective for isolating tens to hundreds of single-cells in
parallel through an array of transducers. To satisfy the unmet need and allow realization of RPE cell therapy
for AMD, we propose to use self-focusing acoustic transducers (SFATs) for damage-free, cell-containing
droplet ejection from RPE monolayers grown on thin solid scaffolds for spatial single-cell RNA-seq. Besides
for quality control in RPE implant production, the SFAT’s unprecedented capability of on-demand ejection of
microparticles or cells (of tens - hundreds of microns in diameter) will open up many new possibilities in
spatial molecular cell study, gene transfection, juxtaposition and manipulation."

More than 3 million somatic mutations and fusion genes have been identified in cancer. However, our ability to

altered through critical changes in regulatory processes, binding partners, or cellular locations, leading
to novel and unpredictable functions. To address this challenge, in response to PAR-21-274, we propose a

computational algorithms for predicting neomorphic driver aberrations. Aim 2: To identify and elucidate
mechanisms underlying potential neomorphic driver aberrations. Aim 3: To elucidate therapeutic
liabilities engendered by neomorphic driver aberrations. We have chosen to evaluate neomorphic drivers
because they, as a class, have new and unpredictable functions that confound molecularly informed decisions,
potentially contributing to the failure of targeted therapy in many patients. By understanding how neomorphic
aberrations affect downstream function within the protein and cellular pathways in tumor cells and the tumor
microenvironment, we will identify therapeutic opportunities that can be directly tested in human clinical trials, as
demonstrated in the current CTD2 project (>10 trials launched). Importantly, our focus on modeling known and
predicted neomorphic mutations and fusion genes in autochthonous models will complement other CTD2

10915604,"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a genetic disease characterized by multiple arteriovenous
malformations (AVMs) which are direct connections between arteries and veins, bypassing the capillary bed.
Pulmonary AVMs (PAVMs) are the most common visceral AVMs in adult (10-45%) and pediatric HHT patients
(60%) and cause significant morbidity and mortality due to an increased risk for cerebral abscesses, stroke,
pulmonary hemorrhage and migraines. Current treatment for PAVMs consists of catheter mediated embolization
with a re-perfusion rate of up to 25%, necessitating frequent imaging (radiation exposure) as well as repeat
interventions. While heterozygous loss-of function mutations in ENDOGLIN, ALK1 and SMAD4 are responsible
for the development of HHT in 85% of patients, we still do not know precisely how PAVMs develop. In
particular, we do not know exactly from which vascular bed (arterial, capillary, venous) PAVMs arise, and which
downstream signaling pathway is most important for PAVM development or growth that could be harnessed as
a therapeutic target. No medical therapy exists that is able to prevent, arrest growth or even reverse
PAVMs. Furthermore, we are lacking precise animal models of PAVMs or in vitro disease models, necessary
for pre-clinical testing of therapeutic approaches. We therefore hypothesized that understanding the cellular
and molecular mechanisms governing PAVM development paired with the identification of clinically relevant,
pathological signaling abnormalities will allow us to develop and test novel therapeutic approaches that prevent
and potentially reverse disease. Our proposal has three significant parts, which are represented by our three
specific aims: First, to develop and characterize a novel mouse model of PAVM formation by deleting HHT
causing genes in different endothelial cell subpopulations and study their role in PAVM development and growth.
Second, to differentiate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from HHT patients into arterial and venous
endothelial cells (ECs), to identify novel common or unique pathways altered in HHT as a direct consequence of
mutations in ENG, ALK1 and SMAD4, to predict repurposed drugs (in silico) and test whether they target the
newly identified pathways in iPSC-ECs and tissue culture. Third, to test whether lead candidate drugs, FK506
and Enzastaurin, and novel drugs identified in Aim 2 (ie Brivanib, see preliminary data) positively influence PAVM
formation, growth and potential regression. Our proposal is innovative because it combines a conceptionally
novel approach (understanding PAVM development by focusing on disease-causing alterations in
subpopulations of lung endothelial cells) with cutting edge techniques (multiplex single-molecule fluorescence
in situ hybridization, spatial transcriptomics, multicolor labeling and high resolution 3-D imaging of the lung) and
novel pharmacological interventions (drugs identified by High-Throughput Screening, predicting novel drugs
in silico).The short-term impact will be a better understanding of how AVMs form in the lung and potentially in
other organs (brain, skin). The long-term impact will be the identification of potential novel treatments for AVMs."
10883636,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Chronic, non-healing wounds are currently affecting more than 6 million Americans.
They have significant impact on patients’ mobility and quality of life, and can lead to a high incidence of
amputation and mortality rate. Biofilm infection is a critical factor that leads to chronic wound formation. Biofilm
bacteria are very difficult to kill compared to planktonic bacteria due to their reduced growth and metabolic rates,
the presence of persister cells, inducible resistance mechanisms in response to antibiotic challenges, and the
mutational resistance development. Current clinical standard of care for chronic wound biofilm infections uses
repeated debridement with prolonged systemic or topical administration of antimicrobial agents. This treatment
has limited efficacy and imposes a significant burden on both patients and healthcare providers. The
development of more effective delivery technologies for antimicrobial agents and physical biofilm treatment
methods is a very active research area. However, current technologies reported in the literature offer limited
improvement in anti-biofilm efficacy, may cause potential damage to host tissues, or require a long-term
application to be effective. There is a critical need for more efficacious and safer biofilm treatment technologies
that does not require long-duration and frequent treatment applications to facilitate a timely closure of chronic
wounds.
Our long-term goal is to apply engineering innovations and technological advances to providing better healthcare
to chronic wound patients. Our overall objective in this proposal is to develop a novel, electric current-based
system to provide a complete treatment strategy for multispecies chronic wound biofilm infections from the initial
reduction of bacterial bioburden to the long-term maintenance of wound sterility during the entire course of wound
healing. Our system will perform two functions to achieve this goal: 1) electrical debridement of biofilm by high-
intensity electric current application; and 2) rapid delivery of high-concentration antibiotics and antimicrobial
nanoparticles by high-intensity iontophoresis. The electrical debridement and antibiotics will achieve a rapid initial
reduction of biofilm bacterial count to below the clinical threshold for wound infection (105 CFU/g). The
antimicrobial nanoparticles will then maintain a low bacterial bioburden, prevent biofilm reformation and new
infections throughout the wound healing process. Our proposed system will be based on a novel hydrogel ionic
circuit technology developed in our lab to allow safe application of high-intensity current to wound tissues to
significantly enhance electrical debridement efficacy and iontophoretic delivery efficiency for antibiotics and
antimicrobial nanoparticles. If successful, our biofilm treatment system will have direct positive impact on all
patients suffering from chronic wounds by significantly reducing the wound healing duration, the amputation rate
and mortality rate associated with chronic wounds."
10913598,"Project Summary & Abstract
Cirrhosis afflicts more than 4.5 million Americans and hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS), the most common
pulmonary complication of cirrhosis, occurs in up to 30% of patients and significantly increases mortality. No
effective therapies exist due to our incomplete understanding of cellular mechanisms. Although classically
recognized as alveolar microvascular remodeling causing hypoxemia, the poor correlation between hypoxemia,
the degree of microvascular changes, and outcomes in HPS remain unexplained. To address this knowledge
gap, we have identified novel abnormalities in the alveolus itself in experimental HPS, along with restrictive
ventilatory defects and elevated circulating bile acids in human disease. Our hypothesis is that elevated
circulating bile acid levels in cirrhosis, affect alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AT2 cells), leading to impaired
surfactant production and restrictive ventilatory defects which influence the progression and outcome of HPS.
To elucidate the role of bile acids and AT2 cells in HPS, we propose to 1) assess the correlation between bile
acid levels and the presence and severity of HPS 2) define the role of AT2 cells in HPS and 3) determine the
mechanisms and consequences of bile acid medicated AT2 cell loss. Completion of this work will define the
mechanisms and significance of AT2 cell dysfunction in HPS, identify novel therapeutic targets and form the
foundation for a broader understanding of how chronic liver disease influences lung function."
10886822,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Muscular dystrophies (MDs) are heritable neuromuscular diseases that cause progressive weakness and loss
of muscle as regenerative processes fail to adequately respond to progressive muscle damage. This ultimately
results in the replacement of functional musculature with a pathological extracellular matrix (ECM) composed of
fibrosis and fat, known as a fibro-matrix, which is a prominent feature of the most common of the MDs, Duchenne
MD (DMD). Effective therapeutics to combat fibro-matrix development and facilitate muscle regeneration are a
major unmet clinical need for MD patients, however, the mechanisms responsible for these issues are not well
understood. This project investigates cellular mechanisms contributing to the failed regeneration and fibrosis
development in dystrophic muscle. Specifically, NAD(P)H oxidase 4 (NOX4) has been identified as an anti-
fibrotic and pro-regenerative target in muscle. This was demonstrated by marked reductions in muscle fibrosis
and beneficial muscle remodeling of severely dystrophic muscle that models DMD, where NOX4 was targeted
using genetic and pharmacological approaches. It is hypothesized that NOX4 expression in myofibroblasts, cells
that produce ECM following tissue injury, contributes to muscle fibrosis by preventing myofibroblast clearance
following muscle regeneration. This phenomenon is known as myofibroblast persistence. The experiments of
this project will rigorously investigate the mechanisms leading to and the pathological consequences resulting
from the development of myofibroblast persistence using innovative genetic models, in vitro assays, and
transcriptomic analyses. Aim 1 will investigate myofibroblast dynamics in dystrophic skeletal muscle using
myofibroblast fate-mapping and conditional ablation of NOX4. Myofibroblast persistence will be assessed in a
newly-developed assay using cells isolated from dystrophic muscle, and several in vitro assays will be employed
to investigate myofibroblast behavior during differentiation and development of persistence. Aim 2 will evaluate
the influence that myofibroblasts exert on gene expression and cellular behavior of myogenic, fibroblastic, and
immune cells in dystrophic and regenerating muscle. In vitro models will be used to discern physical versus
diffusible cues responsible for these myofibroblast-driven phenotypes. The ultimate goal of the current project is
to define the pathological consequences of myofibroblasts in chronic muscle disease and provide solid
mechanistic insight responsible for the efficacious impact of NOX4-targeting as a beneficial remodeling
therapeutic strategy for the treatment of MDs and, potentially, other forms of muscle pathology."
10854945,"The development of TB drugs benefits greatly from validation of novel drug targets in predictive animal models.
M. tuberculosis (Mtb) enzymes in central carbon metabolism are emerging as promising targets for drug
development but have not been validated in animal models that recapitulate the diverse and heterogeneous
environments Mtb encounters in humans. We propose to test the hypothesis that these heterogeneous
environments result in airway, lung and granuloma-dependent nutritional restrictions that, at times, make Mtb
dependent on both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis to establish and maintain infection in nonhuman primates
and/or during paucibacillary infection in mice. We will infect NHPs with Mtb mutants of two enzymes – PFK and
PEPCK - that are required for glycolysis or gluconeogenesis, respectively. We will use deletion mutants to
determine whether these enzymes are required for establishment of infection and use conditional knockdown
mutants to investigate the enzymes importance for growth and survival in different pathologies and for
progression of disease. We will furthermore evaluate these mutants in a relapse mouse model to test the
hypothesis that the nutritional requirements during long-term persistence in mice, when the bacteria cannot be
cultured in vitro, are different from those encountered during active growth and high titer chronic infection and
ask whether they mimic environments encountered in NHPs. This proposal builds on the experience of the multi-
PI team in mycobacterial genetics, metabolism, and animal models, with the goal to dissect the carbon source
requirements for Mtb in the model system that is most similar to human Mtb infection and disease."

Mitochondria must maintain and regulate their proteome to meet the varied needs of the cell throughout growth
and development. Mitochondria employ several AAA+ family protein unfoldases as an important tool in
accomplishing this control. We here focus on the AAA+ protein unfoldase CLPX, which can act on its own or
unfold proteins for coupled degradation by its partner protease CLPP. Loss of CLPX is lethal in mice,
mutations in CLPX and CLPP cause mitochondriopathies, and CLPXP drives cancer progression and is
targeted by drugs in clinical trials in a diverse range of cancers. These phenotypes indicate the crucial
contributions of CLPX and CLPP to mitochondrial physiology. The overall goal of this project is to reveal the
mechanisms by which CLPX selects substrates at the appropriate time, thus tailoring their function to
mitochondrial and cellular needs. Proteomic studies have linked CLPX to multiple likely substrates that control
core mitochondrial processes, although only a few have been further characterized, and mechanisms for
conditional substrate selection remain largely undetermined. One of the best-characterized functions for CLPX
is to regulate heme biosynthesis, a crucial mitochondrial function, by acting on the first enzyme in this pathway,
ALA synthase (ALAS). CLPX activates ALAS by partial unfolding to facilitate cofactor incorporation. When
heme levels are high, CLPX (with its partner protease CLPP) also appears to inactivate ALAS by complete
unfolding and degradation, signaled by a heme-binding site in ALAS. In preliminary results, we have
biochemically reconstituted heme-induced degradation of ALAS by CLPXP, confirming the direct nature of this
activity. We additionally discovered that degradation strongly depends on a heme-sensitive adaptor protein.
The project proposed here will (1) elucidate the mechanism by which heme drives assembly and licensing of a
degradation complex for ALAS, using our reconstituted system with equilibrium-binding and kinetic analyses of
complex assembly and ALAS degradation in parallel with observations in cells. (2) We will determine how
heme is directly sensed within the complex using spectroscopic and structural methods and test how the
heme-responsiveness of this system is tuned to suit different cellular programs. (3) We will determine how a
heme-sensitive adaptor in the CLPXP degradation complex tunes substrate selection by CLPX beyond ALAS,
using a candidate-based approach and an unbiased proteomic approach in parallel. This study will reveal
fundamental mechanisms for the conditional control of mitochondrial functions and will provide detailed
molecular targets for the development of therapy for multiple diseases with a basis in mitochondrial function,
including disorders of heme biosynthesis and cancer."

The overall goal of this project is to collect pilot data to determine if treatment with a novel form of
closed-loop digital meditation (MediTrain), which we have previously shown improves cognition and
reduces stress in older adults (OA), also leads to sleep benefits in both cognitively normal OA and in
those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI is a transitional stage between normal aging and
dementia and is associated with increased risk of progressing to Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias (ADRD). We have demonstrated that a digital meditation intervention (MediTrain) improves
regulation of focused attention in healthy OA. Variability in attention is a preclinical marker of incipient
neuropathology and is elevated in MCI patients. In addition to exhibiting decreased stress reactivity
and a lengthening of telomeres, there were several anecdotal reports from OA that they felt their sleep
had improved. Because sleep disturbances are common in AD and significantly increase the risk of
conversion from MCI to dementia, understanding if this intervention led to improved sleep is critical.
The goal of this proposed research is to collect pilot data to evaluate the efficacy of MediTrain on
improving quantitative metrics of sleep and stress in patients with MCI at levels beyond those seen in
cognitively normal OA. To accomplish these aims, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial on 90
OA (45 cognitively normal and 45 with MCI) who will complete 6 weeks of our MediTrain intervention.
Outcome measures will consist of cognitive/attention tasks coupled with neuroimaging (EEG and MRI),
quantitative physiological indices of sleep and stress, and blood biomarkers of aging (telomere length).
Objective measures of insomnia (latency to sleep onset and wake after sleep onset) and amount of
NREM3 will be assessed using sleep profilers in participants’ homes throughout the intervention period.
This research will provide an important contribution toward understanding the utility of using meditation
as a therapeutic tool for bolstering cognitive reserve and increasing overall wellbeing in OA with MCI,
by showing transfer to real-world metrics of improved sleep quality and reduced stress."
10910173,"Summary
Immunosenescence increases morbidity and mortality after infection and reduces vaccine efficacy. Most deaths
associated with infections by influenza virus, SARS-CoV, or SARS-CoV-2 occurred in people older than 65. Thus,
understanding the mechanism of age-associated decline in antiviral immunity is critical to the development of
strategies to protect the elderly from viral pathogens. Despite its critical role in protection against infections, T-
cell immunity declines with age. During aging, the prevalence of naïve T cells decreases, whereas the frequency
of terminally differentiated CD8 T cells increases. In addition, aging reduces the responsiveness of naïve T cells
to antigen. However, the molecular mechanism underlying age-associated decline in antiviral T cell immunity
remains poorly defined. Using a mouse model of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) infection, we found that aging
increased mortality and decreased antiviral CD4 and CD8 T cell responses. Surprisingly, although aging
increased terminally differentiated CD8 T cells at baseline, there was a profound reduction in terminally
differentiated effector CD8 T cells and an elevated gene-signature of T-cell exhaustion in aged mice after MHV
infection. In addition, we showed that age-associated decline in T-cell expansion was primarily caused by TCR-
triggered apoptosis and necroptosis pathways and was rescued by rebalancing TCR and IL2 signaling. We also
found that aging reduced the metabolic rate of T cells at baseline and impaired metabolic adaptation of T cells
after activation. Here, we hypothesize that age-associated exhaustion-prone epigenetic state and defective
metabolic adaptation impair effector CD8 T cell response in viral infection. In this study, we will define the
epigenetic and metabolic pathways in antiviral CD8 T cells altered by aging before and after infection, while
accounting for age-associated changes in differentiation. We will also evaluate strategies that harness IL2 and
TCR pathways to rescue age-related defects in antiviral CD8 T cells."

This study aims to identify transdiagnostic mechanisms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-substance use
disorder (SUD) comorbidity among trauma-exposed transgender and gender diverse (TGD) adults.
Significance: TGD populations are virtually absent from PTSD-SUD research despite the alarming and
disproportionately high rates of exposure to violence, PTSD, and SUD observed in this population. Existing
theory suggests that these disparities are driven by cumulative exposure to stigma associated with having a
minoritized gender identity (i.e., gender minority stress). To inform the development of integrated PTSD-SUD
interventions for TGD and other minoritized people, research is needed to identify transdiagnostic,
culturally-congruent mechanisms of PTSD-SUD risk in the context of chronic exposure to minority stress.
Objectives and methods: Chiefly, the proposed study is designed to clarify how population-level PTSD-SUD
disparities manifest psychosocially (i.e., via daily behaviors and internal/external experiences) and
physiologically (i.e., within the body) to inform the development of evidence-based, integrative PTSD-SUD
treatment principles. Leveraging the resources and baseline data of an existing parent study (SC3 GM136580;
PI: Berke), I will recruit 70 TGD adults into a two-part study. Following a baseline biopsychosocial assessment
(i.e., clinical interview, salivary stress hormone collection, self-report surveys), participants will complete
ecological momentary assessment (EMA) for 14 days to assess patterns and predictors of daily co-fluctuation
in exposure to gender minority stress (e.g., discrimination), substance use, and PTSD symptoms. This will be
achieved by characterizing concurrent and prospective associations of daily co-occurrence among
discrimination exposure, substance use, and PTSD symptoms (Aim 1) and identifying transdiagnostic
mediators (i.e., internalized stigma, emotion dysregulation; Aim 2) and physical health risk correlates (i.e.,
chronic disease prevalence, stress hormone reactivity; Aim 3) of these associations. Innovation: This study
leverages a novel, unified biopsychosocial framework that accounts for relevant biological (e.g., stress
response dysregulation), psychological (e.g., emotion dysregulation), and socio-environmental (e.g., stigma)
factors that shape PTSD-SUD risk in this population. Identifying modifiable risk factors that cut across PTSD,
SUD, and the conditions of gender minority stress in which they co-occur will directly inform future
development of transdiagnostic, integrated PTSD-SUD intervention frameworks for TGD people by yielding
rich biopsychosocial data on clinical risk factors for PTSD-SUD comorbidity among TGD people. Findings from
the project will also set the stage for research and intervention paradigms that benefit all minoritized
subpopulations that are disproportionately impacted by identity-related violence by promoting a shift toward
more patient-centered approaches to health equity interventions. Proposal relevant to NOT-MD-19-001."
10925134,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Although air-purifying respirators (APRs) protect against the spread of harmful particulate matter from nat-
ural disasters like wildfires or pandemics like COVID-19, industry-standard APRs can cause contact dermatitis,
discomfort, and bruising after prolonged wear; obstruction of visual communication, significant environmental
waste, and, in many types of commonly used masks, provide insufficient or unknown filtration. When the appro-
priate fit of an N95 filtering facepiece respirator (N95 FFR) is pursued, long-term wear can cause painful bruising
of the skin, making them unsuitable for long-term occupational use. This NIH R21 project proposes the develop-
ment of a new type of personal respiratory protection device called the Smart, Individualized, Near-face, Ex-
tended Wear (SINEW) Mask. The proposed design uses electrostatic filters to overcome many of the barriers of
traditional masks while providing a high degree of protection. Using an N95 FFR significantly increases breathing
resistance which is problematic for workers performing physically demanding tasks. To avoid increasing breath-
ing resistance, the innovative design removes particles from airflow, while the mask does not come in contact
with the skin of the wearer’s face. Instead, it uses a comfortable headband to keep the mask in place. The filtering
action takes place along the entire perimeter of the mask, 3 to 10 mm from the face surface. Particles and
droplets present in the air are removed with electrostatic forces. While this principle is common for industrial
electrostatic precipitators (ESP) and is in HVAC equipment, a wearable filter for the face using electrostatic
precipitation is a novel approach, enabled only by recent miniaturization of power electronics and advances in
material science, specifically in catalytic coatings. Resistance to airflow is negligible because of the fundamental
feature of the design – the gap between the mask and the face lets air through freely while removing the harmful
particles in both the inhalation and the exhalation cycles. This feature is very important for exercise and for
comfortable breathing by workers with health conditions (e.g., asthma) that would prevent them from using a
traditional FFR. Other advantages of the design include a clear face shield, which allows people to read the lips
and facial expressions of the wearer. The SINEW Mask is sterilizable and reusable, so it does not contribute to
the escalating global waste problem of disposable masks. The recent COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that
uncomfortable masks lead to reduced usage. SINEW Masks can improve the long-term health of firefighters,
healthcare workers, and any worker who needs comfortable, sterilizable, reusable protection against harmful
particulate matter."

 The Biospecimens Core will serve as a central resource to coordinate provision of highly translationally
relevant animal and human analytical specimens for use in both main research projects and likely several of
the anticipated pilot projects. To maximize the translation relevance of the analyses performed on animal
specimens, patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of
glioblastoma (GBM) will be used for our pre-clinical studies. We have extensive experience using these models
for evaluating the systems biology of intracranial tumors and how pharmacologic manipulations dysregulate
critical signaling nodes within these systems. Coupled with these preclinical studies, analysis of operative
specimens from GBM patients provides a ‘ground-truth’ for the biological modeling performed. In this context,
the Biospecimens Core will capitalize on established collaborations with neurosurgeons at both DFCI and
Mayo Clinic and the extensive Neuro-Oncology Biobank available at Mayo Clinic for provision of both archived
tumor samples and prospective analysis of image-registered, fresh operative specimens. Derivative cell,
organoid, and tissue-slice cultures from both animal and human biospecimens also will be used to enable
reverse translation of key findings and to further refine or validate our systems analyses. To capitalize on
opportunities for coordinated analyses of the same biological samples across both Projects, a Scientific
Manager will coordinate biospecimen collection, quality assurance review, shipment and analyses across
laboratories and projects. The Core also will ensure appropriate regulatory review and approvals are in place
to support both the animal and human biospecimen collections and analyses. The overall efforts of the Core
can be divided into two Aims to support animal and human GBM studies.

 Differentiating normal from pathological cognitive change and identifying associated risk factors is essential
in prevention, early diagnosis, and early intervention for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's Disease,
and Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementia (AD/ADRD). The goal of The Mobile Toolbox for Monitoring
Cognitive and Behavioral Function renewal (MTB2) is to expand the Mobile Toolbox library of brief and sensitive
measures to create a comprehensive research platform that can remotely assess neurological and behavioral
functions across the lifespan in large-scale studies. The expanded MTB will serve as a form of “common
currency” that researchers can use across diverse study designs and populations. We will address the MTB2
goals through the expansion, widespread dissemination, and support of the MTB as follows:
 1. Add a validated and normed library of iOS and Android smartphone-based measures to assess
non-cognitive domains known to change across the lifespan. The MTB assessment library will add change-
sensitive measures of physical, psychological, social, and behavioral constructs known to influence cognitive
trajectories and/or prelude MCI and AD/ADRD. New measures will be validated against gold standard measures
in healthy adults ages 20-85, clinically validated in a sample of healthy and cognitively impaired adults, and then
normed in a nationally representative age-stratified sample.
 2. Extend and maintain a software platform to support clinical researchers and software developers
in the dynamic, customizable integration of the MTB library into research studies. The MTB enables
researchers to select existing measures and contribute new ones, manage study protocols, and receive, store,
aggregate, analyze, and (as appropriate) share data. We will curate the existing platform and develop new
functionality to gather health and behavior data captured via passive or attachable biosensors on mobile devices.
Software code for MTB2 measures, along with protocols, normative data, and analytical pipelines will be made
openly available to the research community.
 3. Develop and support a growing user base, ensure cost-recovery efforts, and sustain continued
development and refinement of the platform. The MTB will accommodate new research-initiated measures
and enable de-identified data sharing. A complete customer support facility will be created to encourage potential
MTB users to explore and test-drive the MTB. They will have access to an online help system and same-day
customer support, which will directly address issues or triage requests to appropriate scientists and software
developers, leveraging our experience developing the cost recovery models that currently support the NIH
Toolbox and PROMIS measures, ensuring the continuing viability of the MTB."

Cell-cell signaling maintains homeostatic functions in the presence of a dynamic environment that involves cell-
derived paracrine factors, mechanical cues, and varying oxygen levels. Macrophages and fibroblasts are key
cell types present in almost all mammalian tissues that integrate diverse signals from their environment and are
involved in tissue homeostasis. Existing experimental models have not been able to precisely control cell-derived
factors and oxygen levels while simultaneously monitoring cell migration and cell-cell communication at the
single cell level in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Hence, a critical knowledge gap exists in understanding the
fundamental mechanisms that control intercellular signaling in complex microenvironments. My research group
will address this knowledge gap by investigating two key questions: (1) How is macrophage migration regulated
by the interplay between fibroblast-secreted paracrine and mechanical cues in a 3D environment? (2) How do
low oxygen levels modulate fibroblast activation, ECM remodeling, and macrophage-fibroblast crosstalk? To
address the first question, we will integrate intracellular signaling biosensors with a novel microfluidic technology
to control paracrine factors and cell-generated forces precisely. Results from these studies will uncover
fundamental principles of cell migration. To address the second question, we will engineer multi-layer microfluidic
devices with integrated imaging-based multiplexed analysis of fibroblast activation and measurement of
mechanical forces. Results from the second question will provide mechanistic insights into the physiological
process of multicellular oxygen-sensing and ECM remodeling. Our past studies and preliminary results using 3D
microfluidic devices demonstrate the feasibility of engineering tissue microenvironments and controlling cellular
responses in real-time. In summary, the proposed studies will establish a new microfluidics-based approach to
studying basic mechanisms of cell migration and ECM remodeling in tissue microenvironments with
spatiotemporally defined oxygen landscapes, mechanical forces, and paracrine factors."

10729510,"This Research Career Scientist award will support Dr. Christine W. Hartmann in expanding her scientific
research, mentoring, and service contributions beyond what would be otherwise possible, thereby considerably
increasing her positive impact on the missions of VA and HSR&D. Dr. Hartmann is a senior VA health services
researcher and implementation scientist conducting rigorous, health system-relevant research. She works
closely with VA operational partners and has had tremendous success in rapidly translating research findings
into practice. The portfolio of her work as PI concentrates primarily on improving care for some of VA's most
vulnerable and high-risk Veterans, those living in VA's Community Living Centers (CLCs, i.e., nursing homes).
At an annual cost of almost $4 billion, the CLC system provides vital care for Veterans who frequently contend
with multiple chronic conditions and are often rejected by community nursing homes. Yet CLCs vary greatly in
the quality of care they provide, with poor quality care sometimes making front-page national news, drawing
attention at the highest levels of VA and Congress. Dr. Hartmann's portfolio of work identifies and addresses
these gaps in quality of care. She has made substantial clinical and policy contributions through her two main
research foci: pioneering the measurement and investigation of quality of care and being an exemplar of using
implementation science to improve care outcomes.
Dr. Hartmann's work in CLCs has had enormous impact. One example is from a line of HSR&D studies in
which she developed effective, evidence-based interventions and an implementation strategy to enable CLC
staff to improve their quality of care. Based on the studies' success, the Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care
rolled the resulting interventions out nationally and created a national CLC quality improvement center that Dr.
Hartmann co-directs. This center has $7 million in funding to date and yearly support for over 7 FTEE. Dr.
Hartmann is also spreading these interventions outside VA. She was awarded a 5-year, $7.2 million NIH
pragmatic clinical trial in community nursing home corporations to improve sleep outcomes for nursing home
residents with dementia. QUERI has also funded Dr. Hartmann's implementation strategy as a Training Hub to
enable its use outside the CLC setting. This work has led to meaningful and demonstrable improvements in
CLCs' clinical quality outcomes and changes to national CLC policy and is only one example of the impact of
her studies. In total, Dr. Hartmann has led, as PI, 8 large VA and NIH grants totaling almost $15 million.
Dr. Hartmann contributes significantly at the local and national levels. She participates on VA and NIH grant
review panels, publishes in top journals, and mentors extensively, including VISN 1 and HSR&D CDA
awardees. She was recruited to her current university in part to provide faculty mentoring in grant proposal
development. She is a sought-after speaker on quality improvement research and implementation science. Dr.
Hartmann will use this award's support to achieve the following specific aims. Aim 1: Improve nursing home
quality of care outcomes, including at low performing sites. We know little about how to achieve and
sustain improvement in low performing CLCs. Dr. Hartmann address this gap not only through research but
also through spearheading cross-VA collaboration. Aim 2: Enhancing the spread of implementation
science in long-term care research. Dr. Hartmann will expand her methodologic contributions through
research and publication and will work with existing national groups to meet the field's pressing needs. Aim 3:
Identify and mentor early career scientists in these areas. Dr. Hartmann will maintain her many mentoring
activities and will continue leveraging her own expertise and collaborations to lead HSR&D's national efforts to
recruit and support early career scienists, including those from underrepresented groups."

The Community Health and Aging in Native Groups of Elders (CHANGE) Resource Center for Minority Aging
Research (RCMAR) is a new iteration of the Native Elder Research Center (NERC) that has been continually
funded since its inception in 1998. CHANGE will relocate the RCMAR to Washington State University’s Institute
for Research and Education to Advance Community Health and continue to increase the diversity of
investigators conducting research with Native populations in the US, defined here as American Indian,
Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander people. We maintain an 18-month cycle, draw on long-
established best practices, offer innovative solutions to improvements identified by former NERC Faculty and
Scientists, integrate a community-based approach, and expand our diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility
platform to create a culture of inclusiveness and support for 9 diverse early-career faculty (3 per cycle). CHANGE
is led by MPIs Dedra Buchwald, MD, at Washington State University, and Julie Baldwin, PhD (Cherokee
Nation of Oklahoma), at Northern Arizona University; they will co-lead the Leadership and Administrative Core.
The Research Education Component will be led by Clemma Muller, PhD, MS, at Washington State University;
and the Analysis Core will be led by Richard MacLehose, PhD, at University of Minnesota. Gary Ferguson,
ND (Unangax̂/Aleut), at Washington State University, will lead Community Integration activities to embed
community engagement and education into the Pilot Studies and all aspects of CHANGE, upholding our
commitment to principles of participatory research. We feature subcontract affiliations with Mentors Valarie
Jernigan, PhD (Choctaw), a former NERC Faculty and Scientist, at Oklahoma State University; Scott
Okamoto, PhD, a current RCMAR Mentor, at University of Hawai’i at Mānoa; and Mandy Fretts, PhD (Eel
Ground First Nation), at University of Washington. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Deliver the 18-month CHANGE
curriculum to a diverse cohort of 9 Scientists pursuing careers in aging research with Native people; 2) Provide
state-of-the-art support for CHANGE Scientists’ Pilot Studies within a holistic framework of mentoring,
professional development, and research excellence; 3) Integrate CHANGE Scientists into a network of
investigators, RCMAR alumni, and community partners who conduct Native health research and promote Native
health interventions; and 4) Embed principles of community outreach, engagement, and participatory research,
as well as diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility across all CHANGE activities. The literature on training
programs for underrepresented minority investigators highlights the success of personalized, culturally-informed
training and access to underrepresented minority role models. CHANGE is highly responsive to RFA-AG-23-
026’s requirements of recruiting Scientists and providing Mentors from the parent or affiliated institutions, while
concurrently accommodating the real-world limitations presented by the highly-dispersed and relatively-small
community of early-stage investigators and senior faculty conducting aging-related research on Native health."
10876459,"Spatial profiling of melanocytic tumors and their microenvironment
Understanding tissue structure is fundamental for biological sciences and for distinguishing benign versus
malignant neoplasms, but histopathological assessment alone is inaccurate for the diagnosis of certain tumors,
including a subset of melanocytic neoplasms (melanocytic nevi and melanomas), resulting in diagnostic errors
and worsened patient outcomes. Therefore, novel biomarkers for the diagnosis of melanoma are needed. To
identify such markers, it is imperative to better understand the interaction between melanocytes and neighboring
keratinocytes, immune cells, and other components of the complex tumor microenvironment in nevi and
melanoma.
Nevi and early primary melanoma display intratumoral heterogeneity, often coupled with low cellularity and purity.
Therefore, the tumor-microenvironment interactions could be missed by bulk approaches or single-cell
sequencing of advanced/metastatic tumors only, which has been the focus of most prior studies. The goal of this
research is to build high-resolution spatial maps of gene expression of the tumor and its microenvironment in
morphologically preserved nevi and melanomas to identify novel diagnostic biomarkers.
The hypothesis is that melanocytic tumors and their microenvironments contain subpopulations of cells with
characteristic gene expression patterns that differ between nevi and melanoma. We hypothesize that some of
these differentially expressed genes are spatially confined and cell-type specific and could be used as potential
diagnostic markers. Our prior data demonstrated differences in CDK2 gene expression between melanocyte-
rich regions of nevi and melanoma. In Aim 1, we will assess spatial expression of CDK2 by
immunohistochemistry in a tumor panel of over 200 nevi versus melanoma, comparing it to proliferative markers,
as well as established melanoma biomarkers, including PRAME. In Aim 2, to identify novel biomarkers, we will
establish high-resolution spatial maps of gene expression of tumor and microenvironment subpopulations in nevi
versus melanoma by performing a spatial whole transcriptome analysis and a high-plex single-cell imaging. Top
differentially expressed genes in these subpopulations will be validated via immunohistochemistry in the tumor
panel described above.
This study improves current theoretical concepts by investigating tumor and microenvironment populations in
nevi and early primary melanoma – the common, yet previously understudied tumor types. Furthermore, this
study utilizes improved state-of-the-art approaches, including high-plex single-cell spatial gene expression
profiling. This research will improve the understanding of tumor-microenvironment subpopulations in their
spatially correct context, relevant for tumor biology and biomarker development, ultimately leading to improved
diagnostic accuracy of melanoma and improved patient outcomes."

Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston with the University of Texas at Austin (UT-Austin) as a collaborating
institution. A major innovation of the proposed RCMAR’s second cycle is that we will use a Multiple PI
arrangement, and partner with the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), a Hispanic Serving Institution.
We propose to maintain the organizational structure of two Cores: Leadership and Administration (LAC) and
Analysis Core (AnC), in addition to the Research Education Component (REC). The overall RCMAR leaders
serve as leaders of the LAC as well. The other components have leaders from both UTMB and UTSA. UT-Austin
will remain an affiliated institution, contributing in particular with REC activities for networking and program
dissemination. The Texas RCMAR’s objectives, and the affiliated faculty expertise and proposed mentoring
program, are consistent with the NIA Health Disparities Research Framework. The Aims of the Texas RCMAR
overall, as described in the three components are: Create the infrastructure to support rigorous research in
behavioral and social research on aging and health disparities in older adults, with an emphasis on diversity,
equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA); Support the AnC and REC in their mentoring, education, and research
activities; Evaluate Center progress toward continuous improvement; Provide measurement, statistical, and
methodological support for pilot research projects; Collect, disseminate, maintain, and update infrastructure on
sources of data relevant to minority aging, and measurements of social determinants of health to all Texas
RCMAR investigators and Scientists; Develop, present, and disseminate instruction in advanced analytical
methods for our Scientists and other affiliates; Identify, recruit, and retain RCMAR Scientists, qualified
candidates who have the potential to develop successful careers in minority aging and health disparities
consistent with the mission and theme of the Texas RCMAR; Create and monitor an Individualized Career
Development Plan for each Scientist; and Implement and monitor a Structured Program of Mentoring and
Research Education, with activities targeted for the scientists in the program. We have assembled a group of
multidisciplinary faculty who will form the Mentoring teams of the RCMAR Scientists, representing social and
behavioral sciences as well as epidemiological and biomedical sciences. We will leverage our existing resources
including from P30’s, K12, KL2, and individual R01’s to support the program of activities. The Texas RCMAR
theme of migration, aging, and health draws on multidisciplinary strengths, and the combined expertise of the
RCMAR participating faculty, including long-standing large population-based longitudinal studies that support
Hispanic aging research, and a goal to incorporate in-depth measures and approaches to contribute to research
on aging of minority populations. UTMB and UTSA have a long tradition of training under-represented scholars
and will now collaborate to expand the impact and reach of the Texas RCMAR."
10729856,"Among all approaches, messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines have emerged as a rapid and versatile
candidate to quickly respond to virus pandemics, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). But mRNA
vaccines face key potential limitations. Researchers have observed that RNA molecules tend to spontaneously
degrade, which is a serious limitation - a single cut in the mRNA backbone can nullify the mRNA vaccine.
Currently, little is known on the details of where in the backbone of a given RNA is most prone to degradation
and design of super stable messenger RNA molecules is an urgent challenge. Without this knowledge, mRNA
vaccines against COVID-19 will require stringent conditions for preparation, storage, and transport. A promising
potential solution is deep learning, a general class of data-driven modeling approach, which has proved dominant
in many fields including computer vision, natural language processing, protein folding, and nucleic acid feature
prediction tasks. In this proposal, Dr. Qing Sun aims to combine deep learning and experiments to predict mRNA
vaccines that are stable at room temperature. By adapting two deep learning techniques including self-attention
and convolutions, she will create interpretable end to end models to predict COVID-19 vaccine secondary
structures directly from sequence information and in the end, she will use a synthetic approach that rapidly
generates mRNA vaccine to validate and further improve their deep learning model. Specifically, the research
objectives of this proposal are: 1) to develop the deep learning model using self-attention and convolution, which
capture long-range dependencies, to predict RNA secondary structures and to train the model using existing
RNA secondary structure dataset with high accuracy and efficiency; 2) to employ transfer learning for mRNA
vaccine stability predictions; and 3) to validate and further improve the model performance using experimental
demand-based mRNA production system. She will produce hundreds of mRNA vaccines sequences and test
their stabilities in the lab to serve as dataset to validate and retrain their model. This project will serve as a
framework for other mRNA vaccine processing for rapid response to pandemics. The secondary structure
prediction knowledge from this proposal will also help characterize natural mRNA and synthetic mRNA for natural
science and engineering purposes."
10890574,"ABSTRACT
Most women treated for breast cancer will experience some form of drug-related toxicity and subsequent
impairments in Health-related Quality of Life (HRQOL), yet toxicity is assessed inconsistently in oncology trials.
Although the potential for side effects of treatments is of great importance to patients in making informed
choices about their treatment, the toxicities are often under-reported. When assessing symptoms of trial
participants, patients and providers do not always attribute symptoms to the study drug, which can result in
misclassification of the maximum tolerated dose. Furthermore, many drug toxicities such as neuropathy,
fatigue and diarrhea are often underreported by providers in trials, and thus a patient-centered assessment
may lead to earlier recognition of reversable side effects.
A major gap in knowledge is how to analyze and utilize patient level toxicity data in real time, and how to
present the data to providers in a format that can result in early toxicity mitigation. While the number of lower-
grade toxicities may increase given the reporting of patient outcomes, acting on these lower grade toxicities
can mitigate serious adverse events (SAEs).
We have recently instantiated an electronic patient reported outcomes (ePRO) platform across 26 sites in I-
SPY2 where we collect adverse events and quality of lie information. I-SPY2 is an adaptive platform trial for
high risk, early-stage breast cancer that continuously evaluates the efficacy of new neoadjuvant breast cancer
therapies. The overall objective of this proposal is to refine and implement new methodology using
interpretable machine learning that can be used to underpin a framework to redirect treatment and avoid more
serious illnesses. Such methodology does not exist in clinical trials today and can hugely benefit patients, their
providers and the clinical care team by tracking the inflection points of patient distress that could otherwise be
missed but may require more immediate intervention. The methods will be developed through a computational
framework in discussion with providers, at different stages of treatment, such as when the severity of a single
symptom really impacts physical functioning (primary outcome), or when constellation of symptoms herald a
significant deterioration in overall health. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the methodology that
we are developing on who will develop chronic conditions and symptoms that may affect quality of life will
mitigate the event of a serious adverse reaction and improve overall quality of life, particularly physical
functioning. We will test our methodology in a group of I-SPY patients and Breast Care Center early-stage
participants at UCSF."
10898713,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 In adults with obesity, 5-10% weight loss improves cardiometabolic risk, including insulin
sensitivity, but not all components of weight loss are equally beneficial. Individuals would preferentially
lose fat mass, particularly visceral fat, a major cardiometabolic risk factor. However, 20-40% of weight lost
through diet, pharmacotherapy, or surgery in adults with obesity is lean mass, which mitigates improvements in
insulin sensitivity—consistent with the fact that skeletal muscle is responsible for most insulin-mediated glucose
disposal—and contributes to weight regain by reducing resting energy expenditure. Loss of bone mass is another
unintentional consequence of weight loss, which increases the risk of osteoporosis and fractures. Therefore,
optimum weight loss strategies should preserve muscle and bone mass. If a lifestyle intervention (diet and
exercise) does not achieve weight loss goals, options include pharmacotherapy such as the glucagon-like
peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), semaglutide. Although semaglutide has the detrimental effect of reducing
lean mass with weight loss, it does suppress bone resorption and increase bone formation in adults with obesity
and stable weight. This suggests bone loss may not be a side effect of semaglutide, in contrast to other
therapies for obesity, but this has not been investigated.
 Bimagrumab, an investigational new drug for obesity that inhibits the activin type II receptor
(ActRII), may be anabolic to muscle and bone. Blockade of the myostatin/activin-ActRII pathway increases
muscle mass, reduces fat mass, and improves insulin sensitivity while increasing bone formation, reducing bone
resorption, and increasing bone mass in rodents. Early clinical data in adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes
suggest that bimagrumab reduces visceral fat mass and increases lean mass. Although just one dose of
bimagrumab increases whole body insulin sensitivity, it is unclear whether bimagrumab improves skeletal muscle
insulin sensitivity. One dose of another ActRII inhibitor increases bone formation and decreases bone resorption,
but longer-term effects on bone are unknown.
 We hypothesize that in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 65 adults with obesity
randomized in 2:2:1 ratio to bimagrumab (30mg/kg IV at 0, 4, 16, 28, and 40 weeks), semaglutide 2.4mg
SQ qweek, or placebo, bimagrumab will result in metabolic improvements in muscle (Aim 1), visceral fat
(Aim 2), and bone (Aim 3) vs. semaglutide or placebo over 52 weeks as an adjunct to a lifestyle
intervention for weight loss. To investigate whether bimagrumab improves tissue-specific insulin sensitivity,
20 subjects will undergo hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamps with [18F]FDG-PET/MRI at baseline and Week 52.
Understanding the effects of bimagrumab vs. semaglutide or placebo (as an adjunct to a lifestyle
intervention for weight loss) on muscle, visceral fat, and bone will determine whether inhibiting the
myostatin/activin-ActRII pathway reduces metabolic risk more than other treatments for obesity."
10904936,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Screening tools for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show poor predictive performance in practice, particularly
for females, which may arise due to sex-related measurement bias of screening questionnaires, and lack of
precision in capturing the variability in early symptom profiles of ASD. Computational approaches to
characterize heterogeneity and assess and account for sex-related measurement bias in early ASD symptoms
may identify ASD risk profiles that can be clinically actionable in practice. The candidate's long-term goals are
to enhance goals quality of life for children with ASD and their families by lowering the age of diagnosis,
especially in females missed by traditional screening methods. The research and training described in this K23
application will build on the candidate's existing expertise, adding conceptual and methodological skills needed
to develop and implement a novel screening approach that will more precisely identify ASD risk in a
community-based sample. Aim 1 evaluates the extent of sex-based measurement bias in measures shown to
capture clinically-relevant variability in early ASD traits in a sample of 3,000 children between 17-25 months
recruited from a community research registry. Aim 2 applies computational approaches to model dimensional
variability in early ASD symptoms and identify subgroups of risk in the same sample that are hypothesized to
vary on clinical outcomes at 36 months. Aim 3 takes a dissemination and implementation (D&I) science lens to
assess parent and provider views on screening practices to identify facilitators and barriers to change via
qualitative interviews (Pediatrician N=20; Parent N=40). This project is in line with NIMH Strategic Plan Goal 2
to “examining mental illness trajectories across the lifespan.” The candidate is a clinical psychologist and
Assistant Professor at the University of Minnesota, with expertise in characterizing sex differences in early
ASD trajectories. The proposed K23 application will provide the candidate with the training needed to develop
new knowledge and skills in conducting community-based screening for ASD, computational modeling of
heterogeneity, and dissemination and implementation science. Mentors Dr. Damien Fair, Jed Elison, and
Timothy Beebe possess the expertise and mentoring skills to support these training and scientific aims. This
will position the candidate to build an independent clinical-translational research program focused on improving
the precision of early screening for ASD to enable precision medicine for early ASD concerns that are
equitable by sex. Training will occur in an exceptional scientific environment in the Department of Pediatrics at
the University of Minnesota and the newly established Masonic Institute of the Developing Brain."
10911299,"Informal caregiving is demanding and stressful especially when dealing with a hospitalization. Many caregivers
eventually become care recipients themselves as years of stress and deferred self-care put them at increased
risk for illness. Self-care refers to the behaviors undertaken to maintain health and manage illness. Engaging in
self-care may improve health status (physical functioning and mental well-being). Older adults with multiple
chronic conditions (MCCs) often depend on caregivers for assistance, especially after a hospitalization, when
caregivers are often expected to follow complicated discharge plans and manage complex skilled care at home.
The impact of care gaps and breakdowns saps time for self-care and causes significant stress for caregivers.
Health coaching, a support intervention, can improve self-care in patients, but studies evaluating caregivers and
racial differences are limited. Less is known about the effect of caregiver support interventions on patient
outcomes. Leveraging the growing availability and declining costs of technology and internet access—along with
increasing receptivity of virtual care in the wake of COVID-19—we developed and tested a synchronous virtual
support intervention, ViCCY (Virtual Caregiver Coach for You), where 10 video conference sessions are
delivered by a trained coach over six months that focus on self-care, coping, and stress. In this application, we
propose to augment the ViCCY protocol to target caregivers during an acute care episode (during/post-
hospitalization) and transitions in care for older adults with MCCs compared to digital health information (DHI)
alone (control group). Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, we will enroll informal caregivers with
poor self-care (Health Self-Care Neglect scale score ≥2), and block randomize the caregivers 1:1 to the
intervention or control group, stratifying randomization by caregiver sex, race, and relationship to the patient.
Both groups will receive DHI delivered through a website tailored with care transitions and self-care information,
and the intervention group will also receive ViCCY. At baseline, 3-, and 6-months, we will collect self-reported
data on self-care, stress, coping, and health status. At 1-month post-hospital discharge the care transitions
experience will be collected. At 6-months, we will compare ViCCY to DHI alone to assess intervention efficacy
using intent-to-treat analysis. A sample of 250 caregivers (125/arm) will provide >80% power to detect significant
differences between the groups on the primary outcome of self-care (Aim 1) and that the magnitude of
improvement will be similar in outcomes in Aim 1 between Black/AA and White caregivers (Aim 2). To explore
the effect of caregiver outcomes on patients’ outcomes we will examine acute care resource use
(rehospitalization, etc.) over a 6-month period (Aim 3). Knowing that not all patients will participate, we will
consent a subgroup of the hospitalized older adults cared for by these caregivers (at least 40 dyads). If shown
to be efficacious, our virtual health coaching intervention can easily scale to support millions of caregivers
worldwide. This application addresses the NIA strategic plan and is in response to NOSI NOT-CA-22-037."
10915615,"Summary
Classical concepts of protein folding in membranes were elucidated many years ago and can now be found in
textbooks. Yet, we have observed self-assembled peptide nanopore structures, with many potential applications,
that cannot be fully explained by these classical concepts. The self-assembled helical nanopores, form
macromolecule-sized pores in bilayers with diameters greater than 5 nm. The peptides appear not to be
hydrophobic enough to insert into membrane-spanning structures, yet they do exactly that. We will test the idea
that nanopore stability in the bilayer can be explained by cooperative H-bond networks between peptides, lipids,
and water on the interior of the pore, in addition to classical hydrophobic interactions with the bilayer. The
nanopores we will study are formed through the self-assembly of helical peptides that have been evolved through
synthetic molecular evolution (generations of iterative library design and screening). Elucidating the nonclassical
interactions that govern the self-assembly and stabilization of these nanopores will reveal fundamentally novel
principles of the structure and self-assembly of amphipathic peptides and proteins in membranes and will be the
first quantitative characterization of the role of expansive H-bond networks in the stabilization of transmembrane
pores. In the proposed work, we will quantify i) how peptide nanopore structure and function are affected by
targeted substitution of critical residues in the H-bond network and putative pH-sensor, and ii) how peptide
nanopore structure and function are affected by changes in peptide hydrophobic residues and membrane physical
properties, as defined by lipid composition. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations will be used throughout
this work to guide the design and the interpretation of experiments. By understanding the sequence-structure-
function relationships of nanopore formation, including pH-sensing and membrane selectivity, we will enable
future nanopore optimization for specific applications. We envision usage in biotechnology and medicine, for
facile protein therapy, drug or macromolecule delivery, anticancer activity, and more."

Although Plasmodium vivax causes more than 7 million malaria cases each year, it has typically been
excluded from malaria control programming in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) due to the absence of reported cases
and the assumption that the predominantly Duffy-negative population is invulnerable to P. vivax infection.
However, there is growing evidence that P. vivax is indeed present in SSA and that Duffy-negative individuals
can be infected, albeit at lower rates than their Duffy-positive counterparts. In addition, the recent
documentation of Anopheles stephensi, a highly competent vector for both P. vivax and P. falciparum, in the
Horn of Africa raises the possibility that P. vivax transmission may be enhanced by this emerging vector as it
spreads southward into SSA. As Kenya approaches pre-elimination phase in its fight against malaria, it
is facing the dual threat of the invasive An. stephensi vector and an unknown burden of the largely
neglected P. vivax species. While models have shed some light on the potential spread of An. stephensi into
SSA, these predictions and their potential impact on P. vivax transmission remain to be confirmed or
quantified. Here, we focus on Turkana, a semi-arid region of northern Kenya where we recently documented
low levels of year-round P. vivax for the first time. Turkana county borders Ethiopia, where P. vivax is endemic
and An. stephensi presence has recently been confirmed. Across the border in Kenya, there is little to no
information available on P. vivax prevalence, clinical burden, or its relationship with Duffy blood groups.
Furthermore, An. stephensi surveillance has not been mounted in Turkana, despite the fact that it is predicted
to have the highest risk of An. stephensi invasion. First, we propose to measure the clinical burden of P. vivax
and its relationship with Duffy blood groups through passive case detection. By working with select health
facilities across the county to screen and test patients seeking malaria treatment, we can measure the
prevalence of P. vivax in suspected malaria cases and compare the rate of infections in different Duffy blood
groups. Second, by conducting follow-ups with treated patients, we will quantify the rate at which P. vivax
infections relapse due to dormant hypnozoite presence following the clearance of P. falciparum parasites, a
phenomenon that has been well documented in many areas where P. falciparum and P. vivax are co-endemic.
This will allow us to estimate the underlying silent reservoir of liver-stage P. vivax infection. Third, we will
identify vectors likely involved in P. vivax transmission by collecting and classifying the species of mosquitoes
and/or larvae from the homes of P. vivax cases, with particular emphasis on detecting An. stephensi. Evidence
from this study will provide the foundation for understanding the conditions in which P. vivax could potentially
spread from Turkana across Kenya and would have broad application, informing malaria surveillance and
control strategies in Kenya and other areas across SSA where P. vivax and An. stephensi may have an
increasing impact."
10930919,"SUMMARY: DATA INTEGRATION AND COMPUTATION CORE
A major challenge to any integrated, collaborative, multi-institutional effort is the centralized management and
synthesis of shared data. The Data Integration and Computation Core will be central to every part of our
Mayo/Columbia CSBC Mathematical Oncology Systems Analysis Imaging Center (MOSAIC), assimilating
diverse data types and sources. The primary mission of this Core is to provide infrastructure for data resource
management, including modeling tools and support.
The Data Integration Core will house and integrate the digital data generated by the Biospecimen Core while
providing a central resource for modeling tools to support our CSBC and interacting with the Administration
Core for ensuring IRB compliance. We will achieve the mission of our Data Integration and Computation Core
through three specific aims. In Aim 1 we collect and process and store data across all CSBC sites. In Aim 2 we
provide and integrate reproducible bioinformatics workflows. And in Aim 3 we provide computational modeling
tools and techniques.
The Data Integration Core will provide support for both projects.
• Project 1: Targeting Glioma Tissue States will utilize the image-localized biopsy locations. They will further
 utilize the stored molecular data accessed through this core making use of the provided bioinformatics.

10910135,"Treatment options for older women with breast cancer are often limited due to co-morbidities as well as the
tolerability of chemotherapies, often the only therapeutic option for advanced stage metastatic breast cancers.
The clinical manifestation of metastasis in a vital organ is the final stage of breast cancer progression and the
main culprit of breast cancer related mortality. Thus, there is a pressing need to better understand fundamental
mechanisms that enable breast cancer cells to thrive in distal organs. As an organism ages cells throughout the
body lose their ability to function or do so abnormally; byproducts and waste molecules build up in circulation
and within tissues, and connective tissues become stiffer restricting blood flow and oxygen, collectively leading
to damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids. The interaction of disseminated cancer cells with the secondary organ
is essential for metastases to thrive and largely dependent on the biology of the specific organs. Despite this,
research to date has largely neglected the role of aging in breast cancer as well as breast cancer metastasis,
and no therapeutic targets have been identified specifically to aid in the treatment of older breast cancer patients.
Thus, there is a pressing need to understand how the age of the patient affects tumorigenesis and metastasis
with the goal of developing better treatment options for older women, a particularly vulnerable population.
Motivated to bridge this gap in knowledge we took a similar approach to what has been used to define traits that
empower metastasis in young hosts to evaluate if there are age-specific traits that enable breast cancer
metastasis. Our preliminary data showed that the age of the host significantly affects the traits that enable
metastatic colonization and revealed mitochondrial metabolism as a key trait in breast cancer cells extracted
from metastases specifically in old hosts. Here, we will test if increased mitochondrial fitness is an essential
feature for breast cancer metastasis in old hosts and define the mechanism by which the aging process results
in this adaptation. Successful completion of these studies will unveil for the first time an adaptation of age-
induced breast cancer metastasis, thus offering a therapeutic target with less toxicity than chemotherapies which
in turn has the potential to increase the proportion of older women being able to receive active treatment and
improve their quality of life."

Our proposed Systems and Integrative Biology training program will support cross-disciplinary training in
quantitative and systems approaches for students across the basic science PhD programs the University of
Michigan Medical School. An overarching goal of the proposed program is to prepare participating PhD
students with the broad knowledge, understanding, and insight into quantitative and systems approaches that
will be necessary for them to readily adopt and adapt emerging technologies throughout their careers. Beyond
simply providing training in specific computational methods or software tools, this training program seeks to
achieve this broader goal by targeting a number of innovative objectives, including providing unique resources
for career developing, building collaborative networks, delivering dynamic flexible training in quantitative and
computational methods, and a flexible portfolio-based approach to tracking and demonstrating individual
progress. Moreover, the program proposal describes an innovative approach to disseminating resources
developed under this program, to substantially magnify the impact of this SIB training program beyond its
impact on the relatively few trainees and mentors enrolled in the program. These, and other defining objectives
of the SIB program will be achieved through a number of initiatives and activities that will facilitate SIB trainees
to conduct and communicate leading-edge integrative research in a multidisciplinary setting. These activities
and initiatives include formal requirements such as a course curriculum, mentor training, development of
individual development plans, and a training and program assessment, as well as monthly workshops that
bring together faculty mentors, current and past trainees to present and discuss works in progress, present
questions, propose and demonstrate solutions, teach one another, and work together on current research
problems. The ultimate goal of our program is for SIB trainees to be highly sought-after to fill rewarding
positions in academia, industry, and government laboratories, as well as a variety of non-traditional careers
where their training gives them the skills to excel in areas of educational leadership, science communication,
patent law, translational medicine, and science policy."

Bacteriophages (phages) are the most abundant but least understood constituents of microbial communities.
This is especially evident in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, where a diverse community of up to 1012
phages are present per gram of stool. Though mounting evidence suggests the importance of phages in
human microbiomes, methods of data generation and analysis routinely used in microbiome science neglect
important aspects of phage biology. Furthermore, there is a lack of foundational knowledge and experimental
tools for understanding phages and the roles they play in microbiomes. This lack of understanding is especially
salient when the burgeoning antibiotic resistance crisis is considered: many important human pathogens are
becoming increasingly resistant to our antibiotic arsenal. While a growing number of clinicians and scientists
believe that “phage therapy” (the therapeutic application of phages to remove specific bacteria from host-
associated microbiomes) will be important in our recovery from the antibiotic resistance crisis, phage therapy is
inconsistently effective. This is largely due to an incomplete understanding of how phages impact their target
bacteria, their off-target effects on other microbiome members, and their interactions with the mammalian host.
Without such knowledge, important facets of phage-centric microbiome community dynamics will remain
obscure and hinder robust and reproducible phage therapy applications. The goal of the proposed research
program is to build a deep understanding of the roles that phages play in host-associated microbiomes and to
eventually exploit this understanding to inform phage-based therapeutic strategies. We will work towards this
goal using phage isolates, bacterial culture, bacterial genetics, gnotobiotic mice, and systems biology
approaches. Using these tools, the proposed research program will build on my previous work with
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron-infecting phages and will focus on an isolate of the prominent crAss-like phage
family, DAC15. We will determine how phenotypic heterogeneity in B. thetaiotaomicron influences resistance to
DAC15, the specific interactions between DAC15 and B. thetaiotaomicron that lead to productive infection, and
how DAC15 influences microbiome-host interactions. We will additionally build a collection of phages that
infect other members of a model human gut microbiome to facilitate similar work with diverse bacteria and
phages. Together, this work will be a much-needed foundation to understand the roles and identities of gut-
resident phages, will build tools for sustained and powerful phage-centric study of the gut microbiome, and will
inform the development of robust and reproducible phage therapy."
10901923,"Project Summary/Abstract
Sarcopenia is a devastating skeletal muscle condition that occurs in advanced age and due to various chronic
conditions. Despite the widespread prevalence of sarcopenia there are no treatment options and the
mechanisms underlying this process are not completely understood. A major hallmark of skeletal muscle aging
is a reduction in myofiber size, which can be controlled by the hundreds of myonuclei within a single myofiber.
Myonuclei are accrued during development, and new nuclei can also be added in the adult through cellular fusion
of muscle stem cells (MuSCs). The presence of hundreds of nuclei and the need to add more has led to questions
if the pre-existing myonuclei are at their transcriptional ceiling and thus require the myofiber to add new nuclei
for adaptations. To begin to understand the requirement for myonuclei to maintain muscle size, we generated a
unique mouse model that allows titration of myonuclear numbers and utilized strategies to track specific
myonuclear populations. Our recent studies showed that myonuclear numbers ultimately determine size of
myofibers, but that myonuclei possess a transcriptional reserve capacity to increase biosynthetic output and
maintain larger cytoplasmic volumes. While the compensatory adaptations in mice with reduced nuclear numbers
were advantageous during development, they were associated with evidence of accelerated aging and muscle
loss, leading to the hypothesis that loss of functional gene copy numbers is a contributor to sarcopenia. Indeed,
by utilizing snRNA-seq technology, we detected altered myonuclear populations during mouse aging suggesting
dysregulated transcription, which could be one mechanism to explain a reduction in gene copy numbers. In
addition to altered transcription, another mechanism for reductions of gene copy numbers is if myonuclei are lost
from the syncytium and not replaced by MuSC fusion, and it is known that MuSCs have reduced activity in aged
muscle. Based on these preliminary data, we will utilize unique models and myonuclear tracking systems, to
uncover the transcriptional reserve in myonuclei of aging myofibers, elicited either through dysregulated
transcriptional profiles or myonuclear loss, and elucidate the link between such myonuclear infidelity and the
development of sarcopenia. Specifically, we propose to: 1) understand the molecular and cellular consequences
of reductions in myonuclear number during aging 2) molecularly dissect the mechanisms of activation of
myonuclear transcriptional reserve during development and aging 3) determine if myonuclei turnover during
homeostasis, aging, and atrophy. Successful completion of these studies will provide unique insight into the
myonuclear control of sarcopenia and provide new knowledge that will identify new therapeutic strategies to
combat muscle loss."
10892299,"Mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including the dengue viruses (DENV1-4), are a major global public health threats
that require multidisciplinary control approaches. The live-attenuated CYD-TDV (Dengvaxia®), is the first dengue
vaccine approved by the US FDA in 2019 and an important new tool for controlling dengue illness in endemic
countries. However, CYD-TDV is an imperfect vaccine with significant limitations. Randomized, placebo-
controlled trials found the vaccine was only protective when given to subjects with pre-existing DENV immunity,
while vaccinated DENV naïve subjects were more likely to be hospitalized with subsequent DENV. Thus the
FDA only approved the vaccine for individuals aged 9-16 years with laboratory confirmed prior DENV infection,
hampering the role the vaccine can play in controlling DENV and highlighting the need for ongoing vaccine
development and improvement. It remains unclear why this vaccine is more immunogenic in DENV immune
compared to DENV naïve individuals. While pre-existing MBCs are expected to drive the more broadly cross-
reactive antibody response, it is possible that vaccine virus enhancement via pre-existing circulating antibodies
and immune cells also are required to elicit an effective immune response. Under this hypothesis, immune
enhancement, like that seen in severe dengue disease, driven by antibody complexes with vaccine virus and
DENV cross-reactive CD8+ cells, drives post-vaccine innate immune response to generate a more broad and
potent antibody response. This hypothesis to date remains largely unexplored. Thus, to address the knowledge
gap, we will leverage the CYD-TDV rollout in the pre-immune vaccinee population in Puerto Rico to prospectively
characterize pre- and post-vaccination antibodies, leukocytes, and inflammatory pathways. Results from these
investigations are expected to precisely identify the mechanisms leading to vaccine efficacy in some groups and
propose novel approaches for future vaccine refinement and deployment. Two Aims will be carried out. In Aim 1
we Characterize the pre- and post-vaccination DENV type-specific and cross-reactive serum antibody
populations and DENV-specific MBC frequencies in DENV pre-immune vaccinees. We test the hypothesis that
pre-existing DENV MBCs will direct the CYD-TDV antibody response in a unique and predictable manner.
Specifically, we predict that pre-existing DENV1 immunity will lead to significantly higher DENV1 type-specific
antibody titers post vaccination with a DENV2-4 cross-reactive antibody response distributed in a pre-vaccination
DENV MBC-specific manner. In Aim 2 we evaluate acute innate and adaptive immune responses following CYD-
TDV vaccination. Here we test the hypothesis that there is a dose-response relationship between acute post-
vaccination inflammatory markers of enhancement and the potency and breadth of post-vaccination DENV
antibodies. Specifically, we will test the strength, direction, and significance of the relationship between post-
vaccination viral load, inflammatory cytokine levels, natural killer cell, monocyte, and neutrophil activation, and
T-cell activation, specificity, and potency of DENV-specific antibodies post-vaccination."

Orthobunyaviruses are an understudied genus in the order Bunyavirales that has no vaccines or therapies in
clinical development. One of the prototype pathogens within this genus, as recently identified by NIAID, is Cache
Valley virus (CVV). CVV is an emerging arthropod-borne virus that induces spontaneous abortions and
congenital malformations in ruminants and humans. Given CVV’s prevalence and its broad host range, coupled
with the expanding geographical range of its diverse array of competent vectors, the epidemic potential of CVV
continues to increase, reminiscent of what was previously observed for Chikungunya and Zika viruses. To date,
there have been no reported vaccine development activities for this virus, and prototype approaches are urgently
needed to develop road maps for vaccines against viruses within this genus should an epidemic occur in the
future. With the rapid adoption of mRNA vaccine technology during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, coupled
with the recent emergency use approval of HDT Bio’s self-amplifying mRNA vaccine platform, we propose to
apply HDT’s technology to develop prototype vaccines for the orthobunyavirus genus with a proof-of-concept
vaccine to prevent CVV infection in a novel murine model of CVV infection and disease. This innovative, timely,
and critically important R21 aims to study the safety profile and protective efficacy of this vaccine, and identify
the important antigens required for broad cross-reactive immunity post-vaccination, via two specific aims:
 1. Evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and optimal dosage regimen for a LIONTM-formulated, replicon-
 RNA vaccine for CVV.
 2. Investigate the efficacy and correlates of protection of a LION-formulated, replicon-RNA vaccine for
 preventing CVV-induced disease in murine models.
Considering a One Health approach, and recognizing the connection between the health of humans and animals,
such a vaccine could have an immediate impact in the veterinary/agricultural market, simultaneously preventing
economic damage, animal disease, and disease emergence in humans. In the event of epidemic emergence in
humans, this approach could be rapidly adapted and scaled for human trials."
10881919,"SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of an unprecedented global pandemic, has just four structural proteins. Of these, the nucleocapsid N is the most abundant protein in the virion, and plays essential roles in genome encapsidation and viral assembly. However, N has thus far defied structure determination of its full-length molecule. Indeed, there are currently no high-resolution structures of full-length N for any coronavirus, although multiple structures exist for individual domains within N. The lack of structural information on N, its assembly and its interactions and encapsidation of the genome stem from the inherent flexibility contributed by three intrinsically disordered regions. In previous work, N, in the absence of RNA or in the presence of random bacterial RNA derived from the expression system, was too flexible to allow determination of a high-resolution structure. The assembled capsid in the virion is also too heterogeneous in its flexibility, positions and conformations to afford high-resolution information. Through careful analysis using electromobility shift assays, size-exclusion and screening by electron microscopy, we have now identified portions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that yield structurally homogeneous, purified N dimers, octamers, and 16-mers that are amenable to high-resolution structural analysis, and which represent the basic building block and likely assembly intermediates of the full capsid. We have further produced a polymerized full-length capsid in vitro that is also amenable to structural study. Here we propose cryoEM of the dimer, assembly intermediates and full length in vitro capsid, complemented by innovative native mass spectrometry and straightforward specific antibody-mediated domain identification. This work will illuminate (i) the structure and assembly of the coronavirus capsid; (ii) how the RNA genome interacts with multiple domains of the full- length N and connects along polymerized copies of N; (iii) conformational adjustments that occur in assembly, protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction sites; and (iv) sites that may be amenable targets for antiviral development."

 Current surgical consent practices are inadequate for older adults undergoing high-risk procedures. A
true understanding of the long-term health complications of an operation is difficult to achieve in one
conversation. To address this issue, our institution implemented a multidisciplinary preoperative decision-making
conference in 2016. To create a more patient-centric discussion, we started including patients in these meetings
in January 2022. Our pilot data has led us to the conclusion that multidisciplinary discussions for high-risk
surgeries in older adults should be the paradigm for decision-making in these complex situations. This
GEMSSTAR proposal is designed to understand the impact of including older adult patients and caregiver(s) in
a multidisciplinary preoperative discussion and to use a shared decision-making framework to optimize the
meeting structure.
The aims of this proposal are to:
1)Identify communication practices of healthcare providers during multidisciplinary high-risk surgical decision-
making discussions that facilitate or limit patient/caregiver engagement.
2)Determine the impact of older adult and caregiver(s) participation in multidisciplinary group discussions on
their high-risk surgical decision
3)Identify critical components to ensure healthcare provider engagement in multidisciplinary high-risk
discussions with patients.
With the support and expertise of the Denver VA HSR&D, we will be able to clarify the benefits of these
discussions and refine the structure model for multidisciplinary surgical decision-making conferences.
Successful completion of this project will allow Dr Jones to become an expert in surgical decision-making to
apply for a VA Career Development Award and further disseminate this model of care."
10900658,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Bunyaviruses are a diverse group of animal and human pathogens of global health relevance. Bunyavirales
order encompasses viral families with similar genome and protein organization despite divergent sequences.
Common to these vector-borne viruses is the ability to cause central nervous system (CNS) disease with
concomitant morbidity and occasional mortality. Lack of definition of key target cells in the brain and the effect
of virus infection on the brain microenvironment are major limitations in our knowledge of bunyavirus
neuropathogenesis that has also limited our ability to develop countermeasures. The consequences of target
cell infection are unknown, and viral determinants of neurologic disease have not been delineated. To overcome
this limitation, we propose a comparative analysis of the neuropathogenesis of 3 medically important prototype
emerging bunyaviruses and define contributors to infection and pathogenesis in relevant neuronal cells. La
Crosse virus (LACV) is found in North America and is the primary cause of pediatric viral encephalitis in the
United States. Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV), a WHO Priority Disease, causes outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever
and encephalitis throughout Africa. Oropouche virus (OROV), is found in South America and has caused more
than 30 large epidemics resulting in over 500,000 human cases of febrile illness. Due lack of direct comparisons,
substantial gaps remain in our understanding of bunyavirus neuropathogenesis, including molecular
mechanisms. This proposal will provide comparative analysis of all 3 viruses with regards to CNS cell tropism,
innate immune responses, and cell death pathways using novel in vitro and ex vivo model systems. Our recently
published data shows that the host cell protein LDL-receptor related protein 1 (Lrp1) is important for efficient
cellular infection by RVFV and OROV. Preliminary data on the role of Lrp1 in LACV infection further supports
similar tropisms by divergent viruses. We hypothesize that these neurovirulent viruses share overlapping target
cells in the CNS mediated by the host cell protein Lrp1. Viral non-structural protein produced from the small
genome segment (NSs) functions as the main antagonist of host cell antiviral responses and a key modulator
during infection. We further hypothesize that the degree of neurovirulence of each virus is related to NSs protein
function. Our highly collaborative and synergistic team is led by Dr. Amy Hartman (PI), an expert in the
pathogenesis of RVFV and Dr. Gaya Amarasinghe (Co-I), a biochemist with expertise in host-pathogen
interactions. Two additional Co-I’s are Dr. Leonard D’Aiuto and Dr. Zachary Wills, are experts in viral infection of
human neurons and rodent neurobiology, respectively. This R01 proposal represents a multidisciplinary
approach to advance our understanding of bunyavirus interactions with neurons."
10891705,"SUMMARY
Sarcomas are cancers of the bone and connective tissue that affect a higher proportion of children than adults.
Many childhood sarcomas are difficult to diagnose, which can lead to therapeutic delays. At relapse, childhood
sarcoma patients have poor survival, with little improvement seen in 40 years. We hypothesize that childhood
sarcomas’ true beginnings – their pre-malignant mutations or cells of origin – in fact occur many years prior to
diagnosis. With support from the Gabriella Miller Kids First, CCDI, and this R03 proposal, we will determine the
temporal order and molecular processes that give rise to childhood sarcomas. To do so, we have drawn on
samples and clinical data from our repositories containing >6,000 samples. High quality specimens have been
selected to inform each of the key temporal landmarks in the development of sarcoma – from tumor initiation,
to the generation of critical oncogenic fusions and malignant potential, to possible relapse or metastasis. This
project will be pursued in two parallel aims, using existing bioinformatics pipelines. First, we will find the
originating mutations for childhood soft tissue and bone cancers. This is motivated by our finding that childhood
Ewing- and osteo- sarcomas are initiated multiple years before diagnosis, sometimes starting in utero. We will
reconstruct phylogenetic trees for rare sarcomas in this cohort. We will see how often early-onset tumors are
associated with early oncogenesis. Second, we will use non-neoplastic tumors of bone and soft tissue as a
model for sarcoma initiation, without proliferation. Complementing this, we will have sequenced late-emerging
childhood sarcomas - from adults who developed sarcoma types typically found only in children. We will learn
whether adult and childhood sarcomas of the same type are driven by the same mutagenic processes. We will
determine the formation signatures of gene fusions, which are major drivers of early sarcomagenesis. Finally,
we will use the same approach to examine sarcoma patients at relapse, to find clinically useful secondary
mutations missed by conventional short read approaches. Collectively, these data will provide a thorough
understanding of malignant progression in childhood sarcoma. This will lay the foundation for trials of early
therapeutic intervention in childhood sarcoma, for example by predicting the evolutionary trajectory of relapse
before it occurs.

10867398,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third leading cause of cancer mortality in the US. Surgical
resection is the only curative treatment, and due to the high recurrence rate (60%), only 20% survive five
years. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy after surgical resection only offer modest improvements in survival. A
new approach to prevent tumor recurrence in PDAC patients is urgently needed.
We will compare overall survival (OS) after tumor resection between the combination of dendritic cell (DC)
vaccination via an improved intraperitoneal, i.p., route, combined with current therapy (gemcitabine), versus
the use of preventive DC vaccination alone or gemcitabine alone (Aim 1).
Given the relationship between migration to lymph nodes (LNs) and anti-tumor immune response, accurate
quantification of DC vaccine migration could serve as an early biomarker for predicting longitudinal response
(OS) and elucidating the cause of differential response rates between patients. Understanding factors that
affect DC vaccine response rates will enable the titration of vaccine doses to optimize outcomes for individual
patients. Thus, we will validate magnetic imaging via quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and ultrashort
echo time (UTE) R2* techniques for tracking clinically applicable magnetic-labeled DC vaccines to draining
abdominal LNs (Aim 2).
We will test whether advanced MRI-tracked DC vaccine homing to LNs can be used as an early imaging
biomarker to predict OS of the combination of DC vaccination and gemcitabine treatment post-surgery (Aim 3).
The proposed work will meet the significant demand for a novel DC vaccination strategy of cancer therapy that
can rapidly be translated to the clinic to prevent relapse after pancreatic tumor surgery while adding an imaging
biomarker as a potentially powerful method to simultaneously predict response to the therapy.
The success of the proposed preventive DC vaccination strategy and prediction of response to treatment could
have a broad impact as a clinical extension to other solid organ systems (e.g., stomach, liver, colorectal, renal,
or uterine tumors) as novel adjuvant immunotherapy to prevent relapse after surgery."
10894134,"Project Summary
The choroid plexus (CP) and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) system serve multiple active roles in regulating brain
homeostasis and have been recently implicated in brain aging and cognitive function. Current work is focused
on cataloging molecules in the CP-CSF system and determining the role of these molecules in both brain
development as well as immune-brain interactions. CP atrophy has been observed in multiple CNS disorders,
and a recent study shows that transplantation of young CSF into aged brains reverses age-related cognitive
decline in rodents. Conditions that disrupt glymphatic circulation via CSF flow in the perivascular space have
been linked to decrease amyloid and tau protein clearance from the brain. These observations in animal and
human brain disorders indicate that the CP-CSF system plays a role in brain disease progression or
exacerbation, especially during aging. However, despite its important roles, the CP-CSF system has largely
remained an under-explored field in neuroscience due to limitations in the number of available tools to
precisely modulate its functions.
By using a novel transgenic mouse line that we recently discovered, our project will address the goals by (1)
establishing a new tool to ablate the CP in mice during the aging process and (2) study the direct causal role
of CSF production in maintaining brain health during aging and in Alzheimer's disease (AD) animal models.
Our rigorous preliminary data indicate that (1) this line can induce exclusive apoptotic cell death only in CP
epithelial cells, (2) the CP ablation results in partial to near-complete (50-90%) reduction in ventricular volume,
depending on the dose and timing of agent administration and (3) ablation of CP and loss of CSF leads to
increased accumulation of both extracellular Aβ plaques and phosphorylated intracellular protein. These
preliminary data support a direct and causal role of CSF production in protein clearance in AD animal models.
In this proposal, for the first time, we will investigate the dose-response effects of CP ablation on brain aging
with a special focus on age-related neuroinflammation, neuronal survival, age-related neurogenesis decline
and cognitive function. We will also assess the outcome of CP/CSF reduction in animal models of AD including
both Aβ and tau AD models. We will focus on AD-related pathology such as extracellular Amyloid plaque
formation, intracellular tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation and
cognitive function.
This project provides an essential platform for elucidating the role of CP-CSF in underlying brain aging and
Alzheimer's related cognitive decline. By establishing a new tool to remove CP-CSF in mice at any desired
timepoint (neonatal to adulthood), our project will make significant contributions and impact on promoting
studies of the CP-CSF system in a wide range of topics in neuroscience and brain diseases."
10911338,"Diversifying the biomedical workforce is imperative to meet the healthcare needs of the U.S.
population. It is a long journey from being an undergraduate science major to becoming a scientific
researcher, often more so for students from underrepresented groups. Some students persist, yet the
majority leave the scientific research career path, either never making it to graduate school or failing to
make the transition to becoming an independent scientist. We will build on our established longitudinal
research to test the long-term effectiveness of two widely utilized interventions: undergraduate research
experience (URE) and faculty mentorship. Between 2005-2017, our research team conducted an NIH-
funded longitudinal study to test the effectiveness of formal interventions in retaining students from
underrepresented groups in biomedical research (TheScienceStudy; R01GM075316). The results served
to highlight the effectiveness of some interventions and the challenges associated with others. We have
12 years of data on 1,243 Black and Hispanic former science students. They are now completing their
training (78% received a B.S., 32% an M.S., and 19% a Doctoral degree), and we have semester-by-
semester data on URE and faculty mentorship duration, intensity, quality, and satisfaction. Propensity
scores will provide a balanced comparison group against which to test the effectiveness of these
interventions, with follow-up analyses focused on dosage effects. Using the Balanced Identity Design
theoretical framework, we will collect five years of prospective data to answer critical questions.
Specifically, we will quantify the long-term impact of UREs on biomedical career hallmarks of success
(e.g., workforce entry, advancement, scholarly productivity), life satisfaction, and well-being. Also,
what aspects of the undergraduate research experience (i.e., exposure, dosage, quality) have impacted
the effectiveness of training the next generation of biomedical researchers? Finally, we will assess the
long-term impact of undergraduate mentorship networks (e.g., quality of support, network diversity) on
future biomedical career hallmarks of success, life satisfaction, and well-being specifically, which
facets of mentorship networks (i.e., presence, quantity, quality) have had the most significant impact.
Finally, we will assess the mediating role of science and science identity balance on the effectiveness of
UREs and mentorship on the success of Black and Hispanic early and mid-career biomedical scientists.
The proposed research has direct implications for training programs and interventions. Our specific
aims test the direct impact of two widely implemented interventions – research experience and
mentorship – as well as the boundary conditions surrounding these interventions on early and mid-
career persistence and success among underrepresented science students."

Myotonic dystrophy (DM1), the most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults and children, is an autosomal
dominant genetic disorder caused by an expanded CTG repeat in the DM protein kinase (DMPK) gene that leads
to nuclear retention of the mutant RNA and subsequent RNA toxicity. The heart is one of the primary organs
affected in DM1. Cardiac conduction problems are present in up to 75% of adult DM1 cases, and sudden death
due to cardiac arrhythmias is one of the most common causes of death in DM1. Unfortunately, the pathogenesis
of cardiac manifestations in DM1 is not well understood. Clinical focus for cardiac disease in DM1 has been on
arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities. Of note, the pathology of cardiac defects in DM1 has been historically
associated with interstitial fibrosis, and fatty infiltration and fibrosis of cardiac conduction tissues. We reported
the first inducible mouse model of RNA toxicity and cardiac conduction defects and demonstrated the potential
for reversibility of DM1 phenotypes by silencing toxic RNA production. Recently using the DM200 mouse model,
we showed for the first time, the potential for antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to treat cardiac disease in DM1.
We also found evidence for fibrotic changes associated with RNA toxicity in the heart. In the past decade, the
advent of new cardiac MRI (CMR) studies has led to evidence of and an increased interest in understanding
cardiac fibrosis in DM1 and its role in the clinical pathology of DM1. We propose to use the DM200 mouse model
as a tool for developing and investigating these ideas and concepts in a pre-clinical model and to try to
understand the cellular and molecular drivers of fibro-adipogenic changes in the heart. We will do this through
four independent but complementary aims. First, based on preliminary evidence of increased TGFβs expression
in the heart, we will determine the role of TGFβs from cardiomyocytes, in RNA toxicity in the heart. Second, we
will study the behavior of cardiac fibro-adipogenic progenitors (cFAP) cells and the role of TGFβ signaling in
cFAPs in pathologic responses to RNA toxicity. Third, we will study the therapeutic response to therapies
targeting TGFβs (isoform specific antibodies against TGFβ2 and TGFβ3). Fourth, we will evaluate next
generation ASOs that target the toxic RNA. With both these classes of therapy, we will assess their therapeutic
effect on fibroadipogenic changes, cFAPs, TGFβ expression and cardiac outcomes, by using ECGs and CMR
and functional testing. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to elucidate critical players in the primary pathologies
associated with RNA toxicity in the heart, and to identify pathways and therapies that may mitigate morbidity and
mortality associated with cardiac disease in DM1."
10930158,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In numerous flowering plant species, the male reproductive organs (anthers), which nurture pollen grains
(containing the sperm, the male germline of plants) and their progenitor cells, accumulate two classes of small
RNAs, i.e., the pre-meiotic (21-nt) and meiotic (24-nt) phased, small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs).
Perturbation of the phasiRNA biogenesis pathways in rice or maize causes environmentally-sensitive male
sterility. There are many interesting parallels between these plant phasiRNAs and animal PIWI-interacting
RNAs (piRNAs), which have also been shown essential for male fertility. However, there is a major gap in our
understanding of how the plant reproductive phasiRNAs function to regulate developmental processes
important for reproduction. Our long-term goal is to understand mechanistic and functional basis for the
dependence on these small RNAs in plant male reproductive development.
 We and collaborators have described the reproductive phasiRNA pathways in many plant species. We
have shown that biogenesis of the 21-nt, pre-meiotic phasiRNAs is initiated in the anther epidermis, but they
accumulate in the tapetum, three layers of cells distal, indicating movement across cell layers. Yet, it is largely
unknown where the 21-nt phasiRNAs and their biogenesis components localize throughout anther
development, as well as what are the targets and thus precise functions of the 21-nt phasiRNAs. Our strong
preliminary data has led to our focus on three Specific Aims to characterize 21-nt, pre-meiotic reproductive
phasiRNAs in maize, a model for plant reproductive biology, genomics, and genetics. The aims are: (1)
Characterize the spatiotemporal localization of key players in pre-meiotic phasiRNA biogenesis, using
advanced imaging and single-cell RNA-seq techniques; this aim will generate a spatiotemporal map of 21-nt
phasiRNAs, their precursors, microRNA trigger, and biogenesis proteins, in developing maize anthers. (2)
Decipher the biogenesis of pre-meiotic phasiRNAs and their developmental roles, via the identification of novel
biogenesis factors using biochemical approaches, using publicly available mutants plus CRISPR-Cas9-
generated mutants to understand whether the pre-meiotic phasiRNAs are necessary for male reproductive

11136183,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In numerous flowering plant species, the male reproductive organs (anthers), which nurture pollen grains
(containing the sperm, the male germline of plants) and their progenitor cells, accumulate two classes of small
RNAs, i.e., the pre-meiotic (21-nt) and meiotic (24-nt) phased, small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs).
Perturbation of the phasiRNA biogenesis pathways in rice or maize causes environmentally-sensitive male
sterility. There are many interesting parallels between these plant phasiRNAs and animal PIWI-interacting
RNAs (piRNAs), which have also been shown essential for male fertility. However, there is a major gap in our
understanding of how the plant reproductive phasiRNAs function to regulate developmental processes
important for reproduction. Our long-term goal is to understand mechanistic and functional basis for the
dependence on these small RNAs in plant male reproductive development.
 We and collaborators have described the reproductive phasiRNA pathways in many plant species. We
have shown that biogenesis of the 21-nt, pre-meiotic phasiRNAs is initiated in the anther epidermis, but they
accumulate in the tapetum, three layers of cells distal, indicating movement across cell layers. Yet, it is largely
unknown where the 21-nt phasiRNAs and their biogenesis components localize throughout anther
development, as well as what are the targets and thus precise functions of the 21-nt phasiRNAs. Our strong
preliminary data has led to our focus on three Specific Aims to characterize 21-nt, pre-meiotic reproductive
phasiRNAs in maize, a model for plant reproductive biology, genomics, and genetics. The aims are: (1)
Characterize the spatiotemporal localization of key players in pre-meiotic phasiRNA biogenesis, using
advanced imaging and single-cell RNA-seq techniques; this aim will generate a spatiotemporal map of 21-nt
phasiRNAs, their precursors, microRNA trigger, and biogenesis proteins, in developing maize anthers. (2)
Decipher the biogenesis of pre-meiotic phasiRNAs and their developmental roles, via the identification of novel
biogenesis factors using biochemical approaches, using publicly available mutants plus CRISPR-Cas9-
generated mutants to understand whether the pre-meiotic phasiRNAs are necessary for male reproductive
development, and then assign functions to novel components of the pathway. And (3) elucidate the regulatory
mechanisms mediated by pre-meiotic phasiRNAs, using established and new molecular approaches to identify
the endogenous targets of 21-nt phasiRNAs and examine how they are regulated by the phasiRNAs.
 The proposed research will have a broad impact on small RNA biology by characterizing the biogenesis
and functions of pre-meiotic plant small RNAs in maize anther development. The experiments will provide key
insights into where and how they are produced, and what their roles are in anther cell differentiation and male

10851881,"Project Summary/Abstract
This project is focused on reactivation of p53 mutants by peptidase D (PEPD). p53 tumor suppressor is the
most frequently mutated protein in cancer. Most p53 mutations are missense mutations, causing a single
amino acid change in each mutant, and are clustered within its DNA binding domain. p53 mutations nullify
its tumor suppressor functions and/or endow oncogenic functions. PEPD, also known as prolidase, is a
dipeptidase important for collagen metabolism. However, we recently found that PEPD binds to both wild-
type p53 (p53WT) and various mutants via their proline-rich domain (PRD) and that disrupting the binding by
PEPD knockdown (KD) not only activates p53WT but also reactivates its mutants. This is a novel function of
PEPD, which does not require its enzymatic activity. Our long-term goal is to advance the understanding of
regulation and function of p53WT and its mutants. The objective of the present proposal is to delineate the
reactivation of oncogenic hotspot p53 mutants by PEPD KD and to assess the tumor-suppressing activities
of the reactivated p53 mutants. The central hypothesis of the proposal is that PEPD binds to nearly half of
each p53 mutant in cells and that, while PEPD is not required for their oncogenic activities, disrupting PEPD
binding to p53 mutants induces post-translational modifications (PTMs) of the mutants that cause their
refolding and reactivation. We will test the hypothesis in three specific aims: 1) to determine binding of p53
mutants to PEPD and their reactivation by PEPD KD; 2) to determine the molecular mechanism by which
PEPD KD reactivates p53 mutants, focusing on the roles of PTMs, K373 acetylation in particular, in driving
refolding and reactivation of the mutants; 3) to determine the tumor-inhibitory activities of the reactivated
p53 mutants. We will pursue these aims by focusing on some of the most common oncogenic p53 mutants
in cancer, including conformation mutants (R175H, G245C, and R249S) and contact mutants (R248Q,
R273H, and R280K). Cell lines and mouse tumor models, including patient-derived xenografts, will be used.
PEPD KD will be achieved using siRNA and a doxycycline-regulated system. The proposed research is
significant, because it may bring about a paradigm shift in understanding of the biology and regulation of
p53 mutants, which in turn may offer innovative cancer treatment strategies. The expected outcome of this
project includes: 1) showing that PEPD binds to nearly half of each p53 mutant in the nucleus and cytosol;
2) showing that disrupting the PEPD-p53 mutant complex by PEPD KD frees the mutant for PTMs which
drive refolding and reactivation of the mutant, whether it is a conformation mutant or a contact mutant, and
K373 acetylation by p300/CBP is key to this process; and 3) showing that the tumor-suppressive activities
of the reactivated p53 mutants are similar to that of activated p53WT. As such, our research will bring to light
a critical intrinsic reactivation mechanism of p53 mutants, which may have far-reaching implications in p53
research and may break new ground for developing novel cancer therapeutic strategies."

Regulation and sorting of leukocyte integrins are fundamental questions in cell adhesion and polarity that has
great implication for various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, but it has been poorly studied compared
to cell adhesion receptors in fibroblast cells. We propose to investigate the sorting of leukocyte integrins
and tetraspanin proteins that play critical role in immune cell adhesion and migration. We propose its
dynamic sorting depends on a novel F-BAR-dependent mechanism that not only depends on curvature,
but on a specific range of shallow curvature. We also propose that this mechanism is governing the
mesoscale pattern these receptors are assembled, including propagating gradients and cortical
oscillations, which link trafficking events to cell polarity. Specifically, in Aim 1, we plan to characterize
surface expression and dynamics of these potential transmembrane protein cargos including integrin αMβ2
and CD81 after systematically identify and validate membrane cargos for the endocytic pathway mediated by
F-BAR protein FBP17 and CIP4 using nonbiased proteomic approach. In Aim 2, we aim to isolate the factor
of membrane curvature and tension using well-defined in vitro systems and to determine their effects on F-
BAR membrane binding and tubulation. We will employ a nanobar-based supported bilayer system to critically
evaluate if F-BAR protein senses curvature. We will also test the hypothesis that membrane tubulation may
require lipid sorting and active membrane mechanics. These experiments will provide a quantitative
biophysical understanding of how F-BAR proteins tubulate membranes without the hydrophobic insertion
mechanisms commonly used by other BAR proteins. In Aim 3, we will dissect the functional consequences of
the altered trafficking by examining spontaneous migration or migration under confinement. In particular, we
will investigate the mechanism for polarized membrane receptor gradient formation. Collectively, combining
advanced single cell imaging, genome-editing, proteomics, and in vitro reconstitution, the proposed research
will shed key insights into the regulation and function of leukocyte integrins through sophisticated coordination
and regulatory mechanisms operating at multiple spatial and temporal scales that have not yet been
investigated."

 Aortic Aneurysm (AA) represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and continues
to be a difficult management problem for cardiovascular surgeons. This disease weakens the vessel wall and
leads to dilation that can progress to rupture in the absence of symptoms. At present, the diagnosis of aneurysm
disease is highly dependent on costly, advanced imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). There are no point-of-care plasma biomarker assays currently available that
either screen for AAs or follow disease progression to inform optimal timing for surgical intervention. To develop
novel assays capable of diagnosing, locating, tracking, and assessing diameter (or risk) of AAs: We have
assembled an extensive clinical plasma biorepository and selected instruments that are quantitative, scalable,
reproducible, and able to be automated. Using this repository, as well as newly collected blood samples, we will
test the hypothesis that quantification of aneurysm biomarkers enables enhanced biochemical monitoring for AA.
 In aneurysm tissue enhanced proteolysis results in pathological remodeling and progressive dilation. This
breakdown of normally long-lasting matrix molecules, such as elastin and collagen, emphasizes the involvement
of Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs), and their endogenous regulators, the Tissue Inhibitors of Matrix
Metalloproteinases (TIMPs). These enzymes degrade all components of the vessel wall and are attributed to the
development and progression of aneurysm disease. MicroRNAs represent a class of small non-coding RNA that
regulate translation and a subset are secreted by aortic cells during progression of AA. Extracellular Vesicles
(EVs) have been identified as critical mediators of cell-to-cell communication and extracellular matrix remodeling.
EVs contain multiple MMPs, TIMPs, microRNAs, and the transforming growth factor (TGF)-ß, all which influence
signaling pathways and contribute to degradation of the vascular wall. Experiments conducted by this laboratory
show that when an aneurysm presents, a unique set of these circulating molecules also emerge. These signature
profiles are different among AA location, subtype, and size.
 Accordingly, experiments and testing will demonstrate the following three aims. First, AA can be identified in
plasma by profiling the MMP:TIMP ratio because it provides a unique metric of proteolytic activity within the aortic
wall. Second, that the subset of microRNAs secreted from aortic cells under stress is correlated linearly to aortic
diameter and pathological progression of AA. Third, circulating Extracellular Vesicle (EV) size, structure, and
composition is altered in patients with AA subtypes and profiling them constitutes a diagnostic assay.
 Even if one aim should fail as a diagnostic assay, another can take its place; nevertheless, this study will
provide mechanistic data and insight into upstream pathways involved in AA progression. Combined, this study
will advance the development of a standardized screening assay for early diagnosis and risk stratification to
mitigate life-threatening aortic complications."

This is an ancillary study to the prospective APOLLO (APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes)
cohort of 2,800 kidney transplant donor-recipient pairs. The parent study aims to test the impact of APOL1 risk
genotypes on kidney transplantation outcomes. Here, we propose to test the role of additional genetic factors
other than APOL1 in determining allograft outcomes. Accordingly, we propose to expand the scope of the
APOLLO study to generate high-quality genome-wide SNP and exome sequence data for all 2,800 donor-
recipient pairs enrolled by the network. Our proposal addresses the existing disparities in research and clinical
care, since African-ancestry patients with end stage kidney disease are currently under-represented in genetic
studies and have worse transplantation outcomes compared to non-African ancestry patients. Our overarching
hypothesis is that there are multiple additional genetic factors in this population that convey the risk of allograft
loss independently of APOL1. Our recent work clearly demonstrates that polygenic background and APOL1
risk genotypes have additive effects on the risk of kidney disease in individuals of African ancestry. Our newly
proposed genome-wide polygenic score (GPS) combining polygenic and APOL1 risk provided substantially
improved prediction of kidney disease. There is now an urgent need to test whether combining donor polygenic
and APOL1 risk improves the prediction of allograft outcomes. Additionally, our proposed generation of
genome-wide genetic data will facilitate unbiased scans for specific APOL1 modifiers with an effect on graft
survival. Lastly, the APOLLO study provides us with a unique opportunity to perform genetic compatibility
scans in full donor-recipient pairs. We aim to test our original “genomic collision” hypothesis at the LIMS1 locus
under which the recipients carrying gene-disrupting variants are at a higher risk of rejection when exposed to a
graft expressing intact gene products. We will then expand this hypothesis to various types of genetic variation
genome-wide, including gene-disrupting copy number variants, predicted loss-of-function variants, and even
missense variants. Any positive findings from our discovery studies will be tested for validation in the
ancestrally diverse international cohorts of the iGeneTRAiN consortium. Our experienced team of investigators
from the fields of human genetics, precision medicine, kidney transplant epidemiology, and statistics has a
track record of successful collaboration and execution of genetic studies involving thousands of participants.
We believe this proposal will challenge the existing clinical paradigms in kidney transplantation, and our expert
team is ideally positioned to lead this effort."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is particularly resistant to therapy and typically presents as
metastatic disease. Characterized by hypoxia, dense stroma, and metabolic rewiring, original approaches and
combination strategies are desperately needed. We propose to investigate inhibition of a redox signaling protein
and drug combinations that selectively kill the tumor by impinging on critical pathways the tumor is using to
survive. Redox factor-1 (Ref-1) regulates the activity of various transcription factors that drive pancreatic cancer
cell proliferation and drug resistance as well as genes involved in cellular metabolism. Under hypoxia, inhibition
of Ref-1 significantly perturbed metabolic pathways (TCA cycle and OXPHOS) and HIF-regulated genes, and
thus slowed the growth of pancreatic cancer co-culture spheroids and xenografts. The first-generation Ref-1
inhibitor (APX3330) completed phase I trial and demonstrated 32% response, predicted PK, and target
engagement with no significant toxicities. There was disease stabilization in six patients with four on treatment
for an extended time (>250 days). Based on encouraging phase I data and a detailed structural-activity
relationship (SAR) program, we have also identified next generation Ref-1 inhibitors that are at lead optimization
stage, a strategy to screen for patients that have sensitivity to Ref-1 inhibition, and molecular targets that are
likely to synergize with Ref-1 inhibition. However, adaptive mechanisms of resistance eventually emerge with
targeted therapy, therefore we will also focus on the development of novel combinations. Our hypothesis is that
targeting the redox function of Ref-1 alone and in mechanistically designed combination therapies will induce
metabolic lethality and inhibit pancreatic cancer growth and metastasis. In Aim 1, identification of metabolic
characteristics of cancer cells/tissues that associate with the outcome of Ref-1 inhibition and prediction of new
metabolic targets to improve the efficacy of Ref-1 inhibition. Our recently developed computational predictor of
cell-wise metabolic flux will be used to study the metabolic changes due to Ref-1 inhibition in PDAC cells at the
single cell level. In Aim 2, NMR to establish direct interactions of Ref-1 and the new analogues, efficacy, toxicity,
and metabolic stability studies will allow us to advance the top lead candidate(s) for in vivo studies for Candidate
Selection (NIH Milestone 4) and IND (Investigational New Drug) submission leading to eventual Phase I trial.
Lastly in Aim 3, evaluation of Ref-1 in preclinical combination therapy will be used to overcome adaptive
resistance. To further predict metabolic nodes that could be perturbed to synergize with Ref-1 inhibition, creating
a metabolic lethality, computational predictor of cell-wise metabolic flux described in Aim1 will be used. The
efficacy of Ref-1 alone and in new combinations will be investigated using organoids in vitro and the mouse trial
design in vivo. In summary, for a precision approach to kill PDAC, we will deliver a potent and selective Ref-1
inhibitor and combine novel metabolic bioinformatics and drug combinations for enhanced efficacy to have a
significant impact on the field and clinical therapeutics."

10932974,"Ischemic stroke (IS) is the most frequent cause of long-term severe disability, and places an enormous eco-
nomic burden on society. One of the primary goals in clinical care of acute stroke is to salvage the so-called
penumbra, i.e., tissue that is at risk of irreversible infarction, but is still viable. This can be achieved through
various strategies that re-establish the perfusion of the affected tissue. However, there is a tight time window for
intervention as well as a risk of cerebral hemorrhage during the establishment of reperfusion and it requires an
accurate assessment of the extend of injury as benefits from reperfusion have to be weighed against potential
complications arising from treatment. The most widely used tool in identifying the penumbra is magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) and exploiting the “mismatch” in abnormalities as measured with perfusion-weighted
and diffusion-weighted MRI. However, multiple studies have found that these surrogate markers have
mischaracterized irreversibly infarcted and salvageable tissue and the inaccuracy of these markers may have
contributed to both inconclusive results from clinical trials and negative therapeutic outcomes. To this end, a
more accurate identification of penumbra and ischemic core that could expand the patient pool that benefit from
treatment is needed.
 The reduced delivery of oxygen and glucose following IS leads to impaired energy metabolism within the
affected tissue, one of the hallmarks of the pathology. Therefore, new approaches for quantitative and spatially
precise assessment of brain energy metabolism could lead to improved assessment of injury following IS. The
recent development of hyperpolarized 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging enables
for the first time the real-time non-invasive measurement of critical dynamic metabolic processes in vivo. Given
pyruvate’s central role in energy metabolism as the link between glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, we propose to
use metabolic imaging of co-polarized pyruvate (Pyr) and urea for noninvasive assessment of brain energy
metabolism and perfusion in a novel swine IS model. Specifically, we will use injections of co-polarized [1-13C]Pyr
and [13C,15N2]urea to quantify cellular energy metabolism and brain perfusion at the time of IS completion in order
to identify regions of ischemic core, penumbra, and healthy tissue using histology as the gold standard (Aim 1).
Secondly, we will expand our study to include multiple time points during stroke evolution as well as after
reperfusion. This will further characterize the temporal and spatial extent of metabolic changes in IS and allow
the comparison with the time course of abnormalities as measured with diffusion-weighted MRI (Aim 2).
 The proposed combination of a novel endovascular swine model of IS and metabolic imaging of
hyperpolarized substrates is a unique model system to study the pathophysiology of IS and develop new
treatments prior to clinical trials. It also represents the first step in developing a novel neuroimaging approach
for assessing ischemic injury in patients and improving treatment selection."

To better understand the determinants of severe COVID19, we have focused on the inflammasome regulatory
protein DPP9. GWAS have implicated DPP9 in poor outcomes in COVID19 and in the development of idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis. DPP9 and closely related DPP8 serve as endogenous inhibitors of the viral inflammasome
sensors NLRP1 and CARD8. This pathway is activated by diverse mechanisms of pathogen sensing which
include detection of viral encoded proteases, bacterial E3 ubiquitin ligases and direct sensing of viral dsRNA.
Our preliminary data indicate that this pathway is transcriptionally upregulated in human myeloid cells in
response to SARS-CoV-2, a stimulus which activates the inflammasome. We have also discovered that mice
which lack Dpp8 and Dpp9 have dysregulated T cell responses and develop more severe disease when
challenged with SARS-CoV-2. Our ongoing work seeks to better understand 1) the immunological differences
conferred by the COVID19 risk allele rs2109069 “A” located within a DPP9 intronic region, 2) the basis for T cell
dysregulation in our novel mouse model and 3) how T cell dysfunction influences disease severity in response
to SARS-CoV-2 infection."
10889196,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The oral streptococci are a major cause of infective endocarditis (IE). Several of these species express Siglec-
like, serine-rich repeat (SRR) adhesins that bind a variety of O-linked sialoglycans on human glycoproteins and
cells. Expression of the SRR adhesin GspB of Streptococcus gordonii M99 results in increased virulence in
animal models of IE. This enhanced pathogenicity is thought to be due the interaction of GspB with the
trisaccharide sialyl-T antigen (sTa, a core 1 sialoglycan) on the platelet receptor GPIb, leading to increased
attachment of bacteria in the blood stream to cardiac valve surfaces and vegetation formation. Isogenic
mutants of M99 expressing GspB variants that preferentially bind core 2 sialoglycans,(e.g., sialyl-lactosamine)
are less virulent, as compared with the WT strain. These findings indicate that differences in the type of
sialoglycan bound (""selectivity"") affect the ability of organisms to both initiate and propagate endocardial
infection, with some interactions enhancing pathogenesis, while other interactions reducing disease. We
hypothesize that in vivo, the binding of streptococci in the bloodstream to sTa on platelets or cardiac surfaces
helps initiate infection, and that this binding is enhanced by hemodynamic effects created by high shear flow.
In contrast, binding to core 2 sialoglycans on blood cells may lead to increased bacterial clearance, thereby
attenuating virulence. Subsequent interactions of bacteria on valves with core 1 versus core 2 sialoglycans
may affect disease progression via different effects on platelet activation, clotting, or endothelial healing.
To further address the roles of sialoglycan binding selectivity in the pathogenesis of IE, we will compare by flow
the above isogenic strains for their binding to platelets, RBCs and WBCs in vitro. We will also examine whether
these strains bind platelets that differ in GPIb sialoglycan content, and whether binding to sTa versus core 2
structures affects platelet activation. In addition, we will assess how selectivity impacts the attachment of
bacteria to damaged cardiac surfaces, as modeled by microfluidic chambers lined with immobilized platelets,
von Willebrand Factor, collagen or activated human vascular endothelial cells, and the effect of hemodynamic
forces on binding. We will also explore the impact of selectivity on vegetation formation by assessing strain
differences in triggering platelet contractility and effects on platelet-dependent endothelial healing. We will also
compare vegetations produced in vivo by these strains for key features linked to virulence, including co-
localization with platelet and biofilm production.
These studies will provide novel insights as to how sialoglycan selectivity and hemodynamic forces affect the
initiation and propagation of endocardial infection. By defining the mechanisms for these events, this research
will redefine our understanding of the key steps in the pathogenesis of streptococcal IE. These concepts and
findings will be broadly applicable to other endovascular pathogens, and will provide novel insights into
microbial interactions with host glycans."
10728552,"Parkinson’s disease and other movement disorders are by far the most common indications for deep brain stimulation (DBS) worldwide. Despite intense and ongoing investigation, there are no established biomarkers to identify optimal stimulation locations and parameters with increasingly complex directional and adaptive DBS devices. Here we will collaborate with our industry partner Boston Scientific to pioneer use of their novel 16- contact directional Argyle lead, informed by their emerging stimulation and recording architecture, NEXT (Neuromodulation Experimental Testbed). We will use advanced experimental and analytic methods to generate detailed spatiotemporal maps of stimulus-evoked electrophysiology in the subthalamic nucleus versus globus pallidus interna in patients with Parkinson’s disease, both awake and under general anesthesia. We will then create predictive models from these spatial maps to guide directional DBS activation and clinical programming. Our overall goal is to pair our novel analytic methods with emerging device technologies to develop predictive biomarkers to guide directional DBS therapy for Parkinson’s disease and other complex neurocognitive disorders. Our vision, and that of our industry collaborator, is for next-generation DBS devices to integrate these technologies into fully implanted devices that can reveal crucial interactions between DBS and human brain circuits to guide clinical decision-making at the point of care during both surgical targeting and clinical programming."
10895492,"ABSTRACT
 The essential metal manganese (Mn) accumulates in the basal ganglia at elevated levels and induces motor
disease. Mn-induced motor disease is historically associated with occupational Mn exposure in adults. However,
environmental exposure to elevated Mn has emerged as a more recent public health problem in infants, children
and adolescents. Environmental Mn exposure in early-life substantially impairs motor function. But, the biology
of Mn-induced motor disease in early-life is poorly understood, and there are no treatments for this condition.
 The fundamental question of how early-life, environmental Mn exposure impacts dopaminergic (DAergic) or
GABAergic neurons in the basal ganglia that control movement to induce motor deficits is unanswered. This
major knowledge gap exists because prior mechanistic work focused on the effects of Mn in adults. But, results
from adults cannot be directly applied to early-life periods because environmental exposures are vastly different
from occupational, early-life stages are more sensitive to Mn, and the impact of occupational Mn exposure on
basal ganglia neurons is itself controversial. Our goal is to establish the effects of early-life, environmental Mn
exposure on basal ganglia DAergic and GABAergic neurons that lead to motor disease.
 We will use innovative mouse models developed in the previous cycle that provide the feasibility, for the first
time, to alter Mn levels specifically in DAergic or GABAergic neurons and isolate the role of the targeted neurons
in Mn-induced motor disease. Our models are based on the neuron-specific knockout or knockin of the critical
Mn efflux transporter SLC30A10. Pan-neuronal Slc30a10 knockouts had increased basal ganglia Mn levels and
exhibited early-life motor deficits. Notably, Mn levels were elevated in targeted neurons of DAergic-specific or
GABAergic-specific Slc30a10 knockouts, but only the DAergic-specific knockouts phenocopied the pan-neuronal
strain and developed early-life motor deficits. These novel results lead to the hypothesis that Mn induces motor
disease in early-life by targeting DAergic neurons. We will test our hypothesis through three specific aims.
 In Aim 1, we will use neuron-specific Slc30a10 knockout mice and test whether increasing Mn levels in
DAergic, but not GABAergic, neurons enhances sensitivity to Mn-induced motor deficits. In Aim 2, we will use
neuron-specific Slc30a10 knockin mice and test whether reducing Mn levels in DAergic, but not GABAergic,
neurons protects against Mn neurotoxicity. We will use a combination of behavioral, microscopy, and
neurochemical assays to distinguish between dysfunction or degeneration of DAergic or GABAergic neurons as
the cause of early-life Mn-induced motor disease. In Aim 3, we will use a pharmacological approach and test
whether dopamine agonists rescue early-life Mn-induced motor deficits. In totality, our studies (1) will establish
a definitive neuronal mechanism of motor disease induced by environmental Mn exposure in early-life; and (2)
may identify dopamine agonists to be a potential treatment for pediatric Mn-induced motor disease."
10909315,"The cranial meninges, which provide a physical and immunological barrier to protect the brain, are
innervated by a network of trigeminal primary afferent sensory neurons. A large body of indirect evidence
points to meningeal afferents' involvement in migraine headache genesis. However, we do not yet have
a clear understanding of the normal sensory function of meningeal afferents and how they become
engaged in migraine. Our current knowledge about the response properties of meningeal afferents has
been almost exclusively derived from single-unit recordings of dural afferents from their TG somata in
anesthetized rats with surgically exposed and depressurized meninges. Yet, these recordings have only
provided a coarse description of the stimuli sensed by the diversity of meningeal afferents. To better
understand the function of meningeal afferents, we recently developed a two-photon, GCaMP-based
Ca2+ imaging approach to monitor their responses to a large set of complex physiological and pathological
stimuli in the intact intracranial space of awake mice. By imaging the activity of meningeal afferent fibers
in naïve mice via a closed cranial window, we made the surprising observations that despite their
presumed nociceptive function, a large subset of afferents becomes activated during brief locomotion
bouts and displays distinct dynamics to various levels of meningeal deformations that occur in response
to locomotion. We now propose to leverage our newly developed imaging approach to advance our
understanding of the sensory function of meningeal afferents and how their response properties are
modulated under conditions that have been implicated in migraine headaches in humans Studies in Aim
1 will investigate the novel idea that the meningeal sensory system is tuned to sense a wide range of
interoceptive mechanical stimuli, including physiological meningeal vasodilation and intracranial pressure
elevations. In Aim 2, we will test the prediction that migraine triggers amplify these normal sensory
responses. Aim 3 is to explore the relative contribution of the mechanosensitive Piezo2 channel in
mediating the afferents' responses to normal intracranial interoceptive signals and their amplification
following the administration of migraine triggers. Our proposed studies and innovative approach to image
the activity of meningeal afferents could provide a dramatically better understanding of the role of the
meningeal sensory system in homeostasis and under pathophysiological conditions that lead to migraine.
Advances made could accelerate preclinical translational headache research."
10876462,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a genetically complex and heterogeneous set of diseases characterized by a
diverse set of mutations. Although many patients initially respond to treatment, many end up relapsing. Over the
last decade, an appreciation of the genetic diversity and clonal hierarchy in AML has opened the door to novel
therapeutic targets and therapeutic approaches to specific AML subtypes. Moreover, AML has been found to
bear unique metabolic features with therapeutic implications. Most importantly, mutations in the enzymes
isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1/2) have led to clinically approved drugs. However, many patients become
resistant to this therapy as well, further underscoring the need for new strategies to target dysregulated
metabolism in leukemia. Through the development of novel microcoil platforms to explore leukemia metabolism
with HP MR (Jeong et al. Science Advances 2017) we have identified a new metabolic vulnerability in the
glycolytic metabolism of leukemia (Jeong et al. Cell Metabolism 2021). This reliance on glycolytic metabolism
alters not only glucose flux to lactate, but also one-carbon flux through the serine pathway, which facilitates the
metabolism of glutamine. Moreover, we found that genetically targeting or pharmacologically inhibiting the
enzyme that mediates flux through this pathway (PHGDH) capitalizes on a new vulnerability in these cells.
Importantly, this targeting does not affect normal hematopoietic cell growth. Thus, building upon extensive
collaboration between our labs and ample preliminary data, we aim to employ innovative approaches to study
metabolism (Keshari Lab), including by developing non-invasive probes to measure changes in glycolysis and
oxidative stress with hyperpolarized magnetic resonance imaging. This metabolism will be characterized in well-
defined models of AML (Kharas Lab), with both genetic and pharmacological modulation, in order to develop a
strategy to assess leukemia-stem-cell-driven AML metabolism and the inhibition of serine metabolism.
Altogether, these studies will result in new mechanistic insights and novel cancer therapies."

 Cryptococcal meningitis (CM), caused by the opportunistic fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans
(Cn), is a leading cause of HIV-related mortality worldwide. In healthy individuals, exposure to Cn in early
childhood results in a pulmonary latent infection that is asymptomatic, but leads to the formation of lung
granulomas. Following HIV-associated compromise of the immune system, control of latent Cn infection within
pulmonary granulomas is lost and the fungal pathogen disseminates to cause meningitis. The host immune
cells and effector functions critical for establishing and maintaining control of latent Cn infections have not been
identified. Clearance of latent infections is warranted in the context of advanced HIV care. Understanding how
the healthy immune response controls latent Cn infection is needed to: 1) define critical immune functions that
prevent disease, 2) determine why a healthy immune system is unable to eradicate latent infections, and 3)
develop targeted therapies that mitigate disease progression in HIV patients with CM. Using a novel mouse
inhalation model of latent cryptococcosis developed in our lab, I will test my central hypothesis that a Th1
CD4 T-cell response is necessary and sufficient to control the latent pulmonary Cn infection, but is unable to
clear the infection due to intrinsic deficiencies in interferon-γ (IFNγ) signaling caused by persistent Cn survival
within granulomas. In Aim 1, I will combine laser capture microdissection with RNA sequencing to determine
the cellular and effector functions responsible for containing Cn within granulomas. In Aim 2, I will use a
mouse model that mimics HIV-induced CD4 depletion and post-mortem granulomatous lung tissue biopsies
from HIV patients with CM to investigate how HIV-induced loss of CD4 T-cells disrupts control of latent Cn
infection within granulomas. In Aim 3, I will use adoptive T-cell transfers and exogenous IFNγ supplementation
to elucidate the CD4 T-cell subset and effector functions responsible for controlling latent Cn infection. The
long-term goal of these studies is the development of immune-regulated therapeutic strategies for HIV-
associated CM. These strategies include clearing latent Cn infection prior to HIV-immunosuppression in at-risk
individuals and mitigating disease progression in HIV/AIDS patients by replacing the essential Cn-specific CD4
T-cell subset required for control of Cn infections. This proposal will lay the necessary groundwork for
developing therapies that specifically target Cn infection, but avoids eliciting immune reconstitution
inflammatory syndrome in HIV/AIDS patients with CM.
 The proposed research and training plans provide a rigorous program for successful completion of MD-
PhD degrees, and will further my development into a successful academic infectious disease physician
scientist who drives cutting-edge translational research in HIV/AIDS and HIV-associated opportunistic
pathogens."
10894753,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Introduction: Skeletal Tissue Engineering Laboratories (STEL) Technologies, LLC is a regenerative medicine
company spun out of the University of Michigan. STEL’s first product, the CGEM graft, is a unique fully biologic
“off-the-shelf” tissue-engineered graft for repair of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) that allows the patient’s
body to regrow native ACL tissue, resulting in improved knee stability and function for the ACL injuries.
Significance: More than 350,000 ACL reconstruction surgeries are performed each year in the U.S. [1]. In addition
to the high cost of the procedure, these patients are at high risk of developing osteoarthritis (OA) within a decade
after surgery. With the increase in pediatric ACL injuries, the long-term costs and quality of life implications will
be an increasing healthcare concern until innovative new treatments are available [2]. The current golf standard
for ACL repair is either non-surgical, conservative treatment or surgical repair. The current grafts used for repair
don’t restore normal function. Early onset OA remains a risk and is seen in about 37% of treated cases [2].
Goals of Proposed Research: This R34 clinical trial planning grant is focused on preparing our team and
technology for a successful first-in-human clinical trial. Regenerative medicine projects are tremendously
complex and expensive and have not been embraced by the Venture Capital (VC) community. To date, our
research has been supported by a combination of NIH and state economic development grants, but to ensure
success with the next stage of development, we must make significant investments in the team and planning of
our clinical trial program. There is significant enthusiasm from the orthopedic community and the proposed
project will advance the translatability of this technology for use in human patients and help our team
attain a higher probability of commercial success by clearing three key milestones:
· AIM 1: Develop a detailed clinical study protocol and budget for a Phase I clinical trial at University
 of Michigan.
· AIM 2: Establish Investigator Manual of Operating Procedures, data safety and monitoring plan
 (DASP) and statistical analysis plan to support IRB approval of Phase I clinical trial.
 · AIM 3: Assemble the Documentation Needed for the Investigational New Drug (IND) Submission
 to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Successful completion of the above milestones will help our team design and prepare for a high-impact clinical
trial program. We have assembled the management talent and technical expertise necessary to help design the
clinical study and prepare the documentation for a successful first-in-human trial at the University of Michigan.
STEL’s “off-the-shelf” CGEM graft for ACL repair represents a significant advancement for regenerative medicine
and a transformative innovation for the treatment of soft tissue orthopedic injuries."
10861092,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sulfites are reactive sulfur species with ubiquitous distribution in all life forms. They are byproducts of sulfated
amino acid metabolism and have been used for decades to limit bacterial growth in food products. Because
sulfites can react with proteins, DNA, and lipids to disrupt cellular processes, detoxification of sulfites is essential
for cellular viability. Interestingly, sulfites are produced by activated neutrophils in response to bacterial infection,
indicating they may play an important role in host-pathogen interactions. The purpose of this work is to
establish how sulfites impact the outcome of bacterial infection, using Salmonella enterica as a model
pathogen. Salmonella enterica is a leading cause of bacterial foodborne gastroenteritis and is the leading cause
of death from foodborne disease in the United States. In our published work, we characterized the role of a
transcriptional regulator, YeiE, in Salmonella pathogenesis. We demonstrated that yeiE is critical for Salmonella
to colonize the intestine because it regulates production of flagella, which are a key virulence factor required for
enteric salmonellosis. Recent work in Cronobacter sakazakii demonstrated that YeiE senses excess sulfite to
regulate expression of a sulfite reductase and is needed to survive neutrophil killing. YeiE homologs are present
in many bacterial pathogens, suggesting an important role for sulfite sensing by YeiE in host-pathogen
interactions. We hypothesize that YeiE regulates the sulfite stress response to allow Salmonella to
withstand innate immune control. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of sulfite reduction in salmonellosis. We
will establish the impact of YeiE-regulated sulfite reduction in murine infection models of gastroenteritis and
sepsis. Since activated neutrophils produce sulfite and neutrophilic inflammation is a key to host control of
Salmonella, it is important to understand how YeiE mediates survival in the face of host-derived sulfite stress. In
Aim 2, we will establish the mechanism by which YeiE regulates resistance to sulfite toxicity. We will establish
the genes regulated by sulfite-bound YeiE using chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing and will establish
the genes needed to withstand sulfite stress using a high-density transposon mutant library. Combined analysis
of these two unbiased approaches will allow us to establish how YeiE coordinates the bacterial response to
sulfite stress. YeiE homologs are distributed amongst many diverse bacterial pathogens, so our work will have
application to a broad range of host-pathogen interactions. Successful completion of this work will demonstrate
how bacteria resist sulfite stress in vivo and will lead to future work to investigate the role of sulfite as a cross-
kingdom signaling molecule and its impact on the immune response to bacterial infections."

 Neonatal brain injuries, hypoxia-ischemia (HI) brain injury is one of the leading causes of disability in
children. Mitochondrial dysfunction due to activation of permeability transition pore (mPTP) has been implicated
in cell death after HI insult but only in the mature brain. It has been proposed that mPTP is non-specific
protons/ions leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane which dissipates proton motive force and renders
mitochondria deficient or incapable of ATP production, often driving cellular death in the ischemic brain.
However, the strategies to address mPTP in the model of HI brain injury in neonatal mice or rats were
unsuccesful. Thus, an identical biophysical process, an activation of mPTP, triggered by similar HI stress
contributes to the brain injury in the mature animals and may not be mechanistically significant in the immature
brain. We have reasoned and found that biophysical and pharmacological properties of the mPTP activated
during HI in neonates differ from that in adult animals. In neonates these mPTP are not cyclophilin D (CypD)
dependent. This a) defines neonatal failure of the strategies which are neuroprotective in adults and b) require
a different therapeutic approach. Aim 1. To determine if CypD-independent mML contributes to SEF and cellular
injury during reperfusion. Aim 2. To determine the pharmacological regulation and structure of CypD-
independent mitochondrial membrane leaks. Aim 3. To determine the role of CypD-dependent mPT in neonatal
HI brain injury.
 Our work will provide the very first direct evidence for pathogenic role of mitochondrial permeabilization
in neonatal HI brain injury models. This will allow us to better understand its regulation and structure function
relationship and help to develop highly efficient strategies of brain protection against hypoxic ischemic stress
by direct targeting of the ion-conducting parts of the mPTP."

 In the human genome, only 10% are coding regions responsible for protein coding. Particularly, the non-
coding regions that directly regulate the gene expression – cis-regulatory elements (CREs) – are of great
importance in normal development and pathogenic disease development. CREs are generally bound by
transcriptional factors (TFs). CREs play an important role in the globin switch during fetal to adult erythropoiesis.
CREs act as enhancers (LCR region), repressors (BCL11A binding site in γ globin promoter), or insulators (3'HS1
and HS5 CTCF binding sites (CBSs) on canonical β-globin locus border). CREs have been explored as new
gene therapy targets for the globin gene expression, which is critical for gene therapy development of
hemoglobinopathies and thalassemia. Traditionally, studies of CREs regulating β globin locus gene expression
are limited between the border of 5'HS and 3'HS1 CTCF binding sites. Recently, together with others, we
revealed a nested multi-loop 3D genomic structure around the β-globin gene cluster. The multi-loop 3D genome
structure extends the regulatory landscape of the β-globin gene cluster with an extension of 145kb downstream
(forming a 3D genomic structure called d-TAD) and a 110kb sub-TAD upstream (forming a 3D genomic structure
called u-TAD). Utilizing genome editing of multiple CBSs (deletions and inversions) bordering the β-globin gene
cluster, we found that the deletion of the CBS at 3'HS1 – the β-globin locus downstream boundary frequently
disrupted by HPFH deletions – is sufficient to induce γ-globin in adult red blood cells. Importantly, we located an
HPFH enhancer that's long speculated for the juxtaposition to activate fetal hemoglobin in HPFHs is responsible
for the reactivation of γ-globin. By deleting the 48kb region to bring the HPFH enhancer closer to the beta-globin
locus, we also observed an upregulation of fetal hemoglobin, suggesting the HPFH enhancer is a novel
conditional enhancer for γ globin expression. Our published work, together with others, strongly suggests the
CREs nested in the downstream sub-TAD of the β-globin gene cluster indeed played an important role in
regulating globin gene expression. These data lead us to hypothesize that CREs in d-TAD are regulating β globin
gene expression through long-range 3D genomic interactions. With the most updated technologies, we propose
two research aims. In Aim1, we will use CRISPR/Cas9-based prime editing to introduce TF binding mutant
precisely to interrogate the TF binding cooperativity in the TF binding hubs located in d-TAD. Epigenomic editing
will also be applied to TF binding hubs at d-TAD in HUDEP-2 cells to examine the histone PTM's role in regulating
gene expression. We will also apply genomic and epigenome editing to make CREs more active in promoting γ-
globin expression. In Aim2, we propose to study the 3D CRE hubs formed by CREs between d-TAD and
canonical β-globin cluster. We will use HiChIP to dissect the interactions mediated by active TFs like GATA1
and repressive TFs like BCL11A. Overall, our proposed research will expand the mechanistic view of the poised
expression of γ-globin and provide new gene therapy targets for sickle cell disease or β-thalassemia."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating brain tumor that affects about 15,000 Americans every year. Despite
maximal surgical resection and chemoradiation, GBMs remain incurable. GBMs are notoriously radiation
resistant. Molecular subtyping of GBMs by genomic analyses of patient tumors identified three major subtypes,
termed Proneural (PN), Classical or Mesenchymal (MES), based on gene expression patterns. Collaborative
efforts between the Sulman and Bhat laboratories over the years has uncovered glioma stem-like cells (GSCs)
closely resembling molecular subtypes of GBM. These states, however, exhibit plasticity and we pioneered the
notion of PN to MES transition based on studies using patient derived GSCs linking MES signatures with radio-
resistance and identifying master transcription factors associated with the MES subtype. New exciting
preliminary data from our laboratories have identified three independent molecular targets associated with
radiation resistance. Using whole-genome CRISPR screens to identify gene targets associated with enhanced
radiation sensitivity as well as and mass spectrometric evaluation of radiation induced protein complexes, we
have uncovered three players involved in metabolic, epigenetic and DNA repair pathways that can be targeted
to overcome radiation resistance in GSCs. The overall goal of this proposal is to combine these druggable targets
with the standard use of fractionated photon radiation therapy (RT) and convert GSCs from radioresistant to
radiosensitive. In Aim 1, we will examine if inhibition of N-acylneuraminate-9-phosphatase (NANP) will lead to
radiosensitization of GBM transitioning from MES to PN states via metabolic reprogramming. In Aim 2, we will
test if targeting High Mobility Group Box-2 (HMGB2) leads to a block of MES transitioning and alterations of
chromatin and if it is lethal in combination with radiation. Finally, in Aim 3, we will examine the radiosensitizing
effects of neuronal differentiation with combined TAZ inhibitors and ionizing radiation in pre-clinical models of
GBM. Our proposal is significant because this is the first comprehensive study to examine the radiosensitizing
effects of cell state transition blockade in GBM. Data generated from this grant will encompass TCGA datasets,
patient derived GSCs, clinically relevant xenograft models as well as testing of inhibitors in these models with a
trajectory toward Phase I clinical trials to overcome radioresistance in patients with GBM."
10879085,"Substance use disorders (SUDs) have substantial healthcare and economic costs as well as accidental deaths
from drug overdose. Adolescence is a critical period in which exposure to alcohol and other drugs markedly
increases the risk for SUD. Early-life adversity (ELA), including interpersonal trauma and loss, family dysfunction
and poverty, is highly prevalent and a well-established risk factor for SUD. Individuals with ELA have an earlier
age of onset for the initiation and transition to SUD, greater severity and a more pernicious course, marked by a
greater risk for relapse and poor treatment response, compared to counterparts without ELA. The neuroimmune
network hypothesis postulates that ELA sensitizes the brain circuits involved in threat and reward processing via
inflammation, initiating positive feedback loops between these systems. Also, inflammatory mediators engage
these neural circuits, predisposing individuals to emotional dysregulation, and “self-medicating” behaviors, such
as smoking and drug use. Such self-medicating behaviors in adolescence, a period of high neuronal plasticity,
can exacerbate the neurotoxic effects of ELA, with a quicker transition from use to disorder. To our knowledge,
this theory has not been tested empirically. Adolescent studies characterizing inflammatory processes in relation
to ELA focused on non-specific systemic markers of inflammation which may lack sensitivity in young, healthy
persons to detect the early signs of pathogenesis, and the mechanistic specificity to inform modifiable pathways,
by which health disparities emerge during this developmental period. The proposed investigation addresses
these theoretical and methodological issues in the following ways: (1) we will recruit adolescents, stratified based
on ELA and oversampling the high-ELA group, without a prior history of substance misuse or SUD, to examine
the probability of SUD onset over a 24-month prospective follow-up; (2) examine whether an inflammatory index
comprising of vertically integrated measures (namely upregulated proinflammatory and reciprocal downregulated
antiviral type 1 interferon genes, diminished intracellular glucocorticoid receptor signaling, increased circulating
cytokines, and c-reactive protein) accounts for, partly, the association between ELA and SUD onset; (3) assess
whether ELA interacts with certain clinical, biobehavioral and family-contextual factors in predicting vulnerability
to, or protection against, SUD; and (4) explore whether SUD onset has a modulating influence on psychiatric,
biobehavioral and family-contextual factors. By identifying the biobehavioral risk and protective factors during a
critical developmental period, the study findings may help shift ELA research toward prevention and resilience
and identify novel biobehavioral targets for clinical trials. The identified biobehavioral targets may elucidate for
whom the intervention programs engage the underlying psychobiological processes that precede the emergence
of behavioral symptoms and determine their role in the pathogenesis of SUD in this high-risk group. Ultimately,
such knowledge can enhance precision care in mitigating SUD risk in ELA-exposed youth and allowing them to
reach their full potential as adults and reducing the socioeconomic burden associated with early-onset SUD."

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect in humans and patients with conotruncal
defects comprise 30% of this population. Malformations of the distal aspect of the ventricle, the infundibulum,
and the proximal aspect of the great arteries lead to conotruncal anomalies. Specific examples include
transposition of the great vessels, double outlet right ventricle, and Tetralogy of Fallot. Among this patient cohort,
the mortality rate of 17% indicates a dire need for improvement in our understanding of the early developmental
signals guiding these aberrations in outflow tract (OFT) morphogenesis. The purpose of this application is to
uncover the molecular, cellular, and biomechanical mechanisms that account for disruptions in OFT development
and underlie human conotruncal CHDs. The emerging focus on extracellular matrix (ECM) in cardiac
development and disease points to this specialized, non-cellular protein network as a key player in sculpting the
conotruncus. Yet, we have limited appreciation of the individual ECM complements functioning during OFT
formation. We identified Fibulin (Fbln) proteins as novel regulators of the ECM essential for OFT growth and
expansion. Our preliminary data demonstrate that Fblns are required to establish the proper size of the OFT.
Fblns are required for accumulation of endothelial cells (ECs) through Smad3-dependent TGF-β cues. Further,
Fblns stimulate smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation and elastin assembly to establish the OFT caliber.
Importantly, tissue stiffness of this auxiliary chamber is elevated; this decreased elasticity contributes to altered
flow profiles. Altogether, our preliminary data highlight that the underlying mechanisms responsible for the
impaired OFT growth in the fbln loss-of-function model are multifactorial, representing a complex interplay of
defects in EC accumulation, SMC differentiation, tissue stiffness, and flow-related factors. We put forth the
overarching hypothesis that Fbln genes are essential to establish OFT dimensions and compliance by regulating
TGF-β signals in ECs and by promoting ECM deposition by SMCs, ultimately generating shear forces that
propagate further expansion. We will examine this model with the following aims: dissect the mechanisms
mediated by fbln2 in EC accumulation and OFT growth (Aim 1), investigate the function of Fbln5 in regulating
elastin assembly, stiffness, and OFT expansion (Aim 2), and determine shear stress and mechanobiological
mechanisms operating downstream of Fbln proteins via Piezo1 in ECs and SMCs (Aim 3). Insights gained from
these proposed studies will shed light on the biomechanical mechanisms responsible for compliance and elastic
deformation at the arterial pole with implications for diseases involving stenosis of the conotruncal region.
Furthermore, probing the cell type-specific functions of Fbln proteins will augment our ability to identify novel
therapeutic targets and protocols for tissue engineering of OFT conduits and artificial valves."

Children facing adversity are at high risk for poor socio-emotional and cognitive outcomes and
later psychopathology. However, there is increasing evidence that these negative developmental
trajectories can be significantly improved by enhancing nurturing caregiving early in development.
Despite numerous empirically supported early interventions, these programs are not readily
accessible to the majority of US children most in need. Based on this, there is an urgent need to
make these interventions feasible and readily available to these communities. To do this we
propose to test the effectiveness of a brief 6 session parent-child preventive intervention
conducted by video conference in the family's home and study two implementation methods within
3 high-risk school districts. The intervention, entitled “THRIVE,” is a previously tested early parent
child intervention piloted in a St. Louis county district which proved feasible, acceptable and
appeared effective. Caregiver-child dyads aged 4.0-6.11 meeting inclusion criteria will be
randomized to a THRIVE condition or an established online parenting education of comparable
length. Although the use of schools as a service delivery platform will increase accessibility, this
system presents unique and complex challenges for implementation of a mental health
prevention. Therefore, we will use a hybrid effectiveness-implementation design to test the
effectiveness of THRIVE compared to Parenting Wisely, while also assessing the impact of two
forms of implementation (coaching vs. no coaching) on study outcomes. Assessments of key
outcome measures, including child behavior, social, and emotional functioning, child
psychopathology, parenting stress, optimism, and depressive symptoms, and changes in
parenting and the parent-child dyadic relationship (observational and neural using functional near
infrared spectroscopy' fNIRS) will be measured at baseline, post-treatment (P1), and 12-weeks
post-treatment (P2). We will also test how the preventive intervention mechanistically targets the
quality of the caregiver-child relationship by enhancing caregiver responsiveness and sensitivity
via baseline, mid-treatment and post-treatment (P1) assessments. This project provides the first
test of a brief parent-child early prevention accessed through schools and delivered in home by
video conference with minimal therapist training to enhance access to care. It further examines
the cost-effectiveness of therapist coaching as a means to improve implementation and clinical
outcomes."
10908696,"Abstract: Lyme disease (LD) leads to lifelong health problems if standard antibiotic therapy is not initiated
during the first 2-3 weeks after infection. Diagnosis for LD currently relies on seroconversion and is unreliable
during acute disease. Cases of suspected acute LD should be confirmed using clinical diagnostic assays. N-
linked glycosylation is one of the most abundant post-translational modifications of serum proteins. While it is
dynamic in nature, it is also highly consistent in a healthy state. N-linked glycosylation of serum immunoglobulins
(Igs) are known to change in a disease specific manner and can direct the host immune response toward a pro-
or an anti-inflammatory response. We previously observed that Ig N-glycans produced during acute LD contain
specific alterations in the abidance of galactose and sialic acid. We hypothesize that these Ig alterations are
antigen-specific, and that the glycosylation patterns present will negatively impact downstream immune
responses. This hypothesis is based on our preliminary data, known LD B-cell perturbations, and reports of IgG
N-glycans altering the immune response to COVID-19, tuberculosis, multiple sclerosis, and HIV.
 This proposal is novel and unique because it is the only study that examines the role of glycosylation
during the human immune response to LD. This proposal is built on our preliminary work where we identified
aberrant glycosylation on the total serum IgG and IgM in acute LD patients prior to seroconversion. In this
proposal, we examine the glycosylation of Igs specific to LD antigens and determine if acute LD infection will
alter B-cell responses to produce antigen specific Igs with the same unique glycosylation changes seen in our
preliminary data. Additionally, we examine how the glycosylation pattern on antigen specific Igs effect the
immune response to LD.
 In Aim 1, we isolate Igs specific to the LD antigen VlsE and establish the IgG and IgM N-glycan profiles.
The result will determine if antigen specific Igs contain the same aberrant glycosylation found in the total Ig
population of acute LD patients. In Aim 2, we quantify the impact of LD antigen-specific IgG glycosylation on the
promotion of ADCC and complement deposition. The result will determine if there is a link between IgG
glycosylation and the inability of the patients to clear the Borrelia burgdorferi spirochete that causes LD. In Aim
3, we quantify the impact of antigen-specific IgM glycosylation on the complement deposition rate. Complement
deposition leads to rapid clearance of Lyme disease pathogens. Altered glycosylation of IgM could impair
complement deposition and impede the ability of the human host to clear the infection.
 This work will establish a new mechanism of Borrelial immune evasion, characterize the host-response
to LD pathogenesis in humans. Additionally, the results will potentiate the use of Ig N-glycans to serve as
multiplexed biomarkers in a novel Lyme disease diagnostic assay and guide the glycoengineering of
antibodies for use in intravenous therapy in hard-to-treat disseminated Lyme disease cases."
10909346,"The WF OAIC Leadership and Administrative Core (LAC) sets the scientific direction, optimizes
administrative and fiscal operations, and ensures the scientific integrity of the WF OAIC. LAC leaders, Drs.
Kritchevsky and Kitzman, will continue to use a proven collaborative leadership model that fosters operational
efficiency, high productivity, and innovative translational and multidisciplinary research focused on our theme,
“Integrating pathways affecting physical function for new approaches to disability treatment and prevention.”
The Specific Aims of the Core are to:
 1. Provide overall scientific leadership and direction for the WF OAIC;
 2. Efficiently manage the resources of the WF OAIC, in compliance with applicable institutional and
 NIA/NIH policies; and
 3. Increase WF OAIC’s impact by attracting new investigators, capturing new resources, and disseminating
 and implementing findings in diverse settings.
The LAC will guide the direction of the WF OAIC by 1) providing administrative and budgetary support to the
WF OAIC in accordance with OAIC priorities; 2) seeking additional institutional resources to extend the scope
of its activities; 3) arranging scientific review of proposed pilot and development projects and REC candidates;
4) monitoring all OAIC activities for timely completion and achievement of goals and milestones, and
intervening to remove roadblocks or, if necessary, redirect resources; and 5) ensuring all OAIC-supported
activities follow federal and institutional rules, regulations, and guidelines for the responsible conduct of
research and participant safety. Under the LAC’s guidance, the cohesive and collaborative leadership and
experienced staff of the LAC will continue to foster a productive, cohesive, and dynamic OAIC."
10909350,"The WF OAIC Integrative Biology Core (IBC) is critical to the overall mission and goals of the WF OAIC. It
plays an essential role in identifying and integrating biologic factors that contribute to aging-related disability
processes. The IBC translates knowledge on biological aging translationally between preclinical animal
models and humans to discover and test biological contributors to human functional decline. The IBC provides
material support and guidance needed to test both traditional and novel biological factors in age-related
functional decline and disability. In the next cycle, we will further the overarching IBC hypotheses that: 1)
integrative biological processes influence aging-related loss of physical function, and 2) therapeutic
modification of these biological processes will slow progression to disability.
The premise behind the IBC’s work is that (a) specific cellular, organ, and systemic processes combine in an
integrated manner to influence aging-related loss of function, and (b) therapeutic modification of these factors
will slow progression to disability.
The Specific Aims of the IBC are to: 1) Provide key services that advance the understanding of the cellular,
tissue, and systemic biological factors underlying aging-related decline in physical function; 2) Facilitate
acquisition and distribution of biospecimen resources in the OAIC-supported Integrated Aging Studies
Databank Repository (IASDR) to efficiently generate and test novel hypotheses; 3) Develop new methods and
collaborations that expand Core services for OAIC investigators. 4) Provide OAIC-supported faculty and
trainees mentorship and education on biological factors underlying aging-related decline in physical function.
Drs. Delbono and Justice will co-Lead the IBC, which uses state-of-the-art cellular and molecular techniques
of the collective laboratories of IBC investigators and other WFUSM Core laboratories, to support novel
research thematically aligned with the WF OAIC objective of “Integrating pathways affecting physical function
for new approaches to disability treatment and prevention”.
In Year 1 the IBC will provide supplies, technical resources, and consultative scientific support for: 2 pilots (1
led by a REC Scholar); 2 REC Scholars; 1 Development Project; and testing of new hypotheses by adding
biological outcomes to be assessed in 10 Externally-supported Projects. The Core provides the OAIC with
cutting-edge scientific instruments and technology, and breadth of expertise across the translational research
spectrum required to accomplish our aims efficiently, with economy of scale, and in close coordination with
the other OAIC cores."
10916499,"The Operations Core (OC) supports research on multifactorial geriatric conditions by recruiting older adults
who are diverse and representative, engaging older adults from the community as stakeholders, monitoring the
safety of participants, offering resources to support aging research, designing electronic data collection sys-
tems that result in high-quality data, developing software applications to support study workflow and analysis,
and collecting, preparing and reporting data that account for the complexity of multifactorial aging research.
The overall goal of the OC (RC1) is to ensure the successful implementation of multifactorial aging research.
This goal will be accomplished by leading coordinated efforts with OAIC investigators and research staff. The
Specific Aims of the OC are to: (1) provide services to achieve the aims of OAIC-funded and other aging-fo-
cused research projects and the infrastructure to support investigators leading these projects; (2) collaborate to
improve field, data management and informatics methodologies needed to advance aging-focused research on
multifactorial geriatric conditions and to foster the development of the next generation of aging-focused investi-
gators; and (3) conduct innovative Development Projects that advance the mission of the Yale OAIC.
 During the current funding cycle (2018-present), the OC provided research support for 16 OAIC-funded
projects and 35 External Projects, consulted with 116 Yale investigators on field and data management plans
for projects and grant submissions, was awarded NIH supplemental funding to build an innovative suite of soft-
ware tools called the Yale Study Support Suite, and collaborated with other Pepper Centers and NIA-spon-
sored programs on research projects, delivery of educational seminars, and software dissemination. These OC
efforts have resulted in 129 publications and more than 30 extramurally funded grants totaling over $150 mil-
lion. During the next funding cycle, the OC will: (1) collaborate on 5 of the 6 proposed REC and PESC projects
and 34 of the 40 funded External Projects; (2) mentor new research staff in the OC; (3) refine and adapt ser-
vices to meet program needs; (4) advise and support investigators on study operations, reporting, and compli-
ance with NIH requirements; (5) broaden the impact of the core by disseminating innovative software products;
and (6) enhance our research informatics infrastructure by working with the OAIC Coordinating Center to iden-
tify funding sources that will permit the further expansion of the Yale Study Support Suite (YES3). The YES3
software will serve as an integral part of study operations support for OAIC projects, and with continued expan-
sion through the proposed Development Project (DP-1), will provide additional tools for analysis, reporting, and
monitoring. The goal of DP-1 is to build the YES3 Datamart REDCap External Module (EM), innovative soft-
ware that will integrate with the YES3 Exporter, an EM developed during the current funding cycle. The new
Datamart EM will further support analysis, monitoring, and reporting of OAIC studies and will be designed to be
compatible with future YES3 components that share data with sponsor and regulatory agencies."
10916501,"The overarching goals of the Biostatistics Core (BC), RC-2, are to provide design and analytical services to
investigators conducting studies of multifactorial geriatric conditions; to develop and disseminate new design
and analytical techniques for conducting studies with older persons; and to train a cadre of clinical
investigators, biostatisticians, and epidemiologists in the skills necessary to design, conduct, and analyze
gerontologic studies. The BC provides state-of-the-art research design and biostatistical expertise for the Yale
OAIC with the following specific aims: 1) to collaborate with REC Scholars and other REC trainees, PES
investigators, Operations Core (OC) colleagues, and investigators of External Projects to achieve the mission
of the Yale OAIC in promoting the understanding and management of multifactorial geriatric conditions; 2) to
develop new and rigorous methods that address the challenges of designing and analyzing studies in basic,
translational, and clinical geriatric/aging research, with special emphasis on introducing rigorous statistical
methods; and 3) to train the next generation of gerontologic biostatisticians, epidemiologists, and early-stage
investigators in Gerontologic Biostatistical Methods specific to studies of multifactorial geriatric conditions.
To achieve these aims and ensure that OAIC investigators continue to stay at the forefront of methodologically
rigorous research, we have formalized a partnership with the Yale Center for Analytical Sciences (YCAS), a
center for collaborative science that serves as the Biostatistics and Epidemiologic core of the Yale Clinical and
Translational Sciences Award (CTSA). This partnership boosts the reach of the BC in two important ways.
First, it expands the resources available to our REC trainees and other OAIC investigators by providing access
to additional expertise and mentorship. Second, it brings a wealth of experience in newer approaches that
complement the techniques previously available to OAIC investigators. Productivity of the BC during the
current funding cycle has been high, as evidenced by nearly 200 peer-reviewed publications and collaboration
on 73 successfully funded extramural grants (>$123.4 million total costs) and on 13 pending grant applications
representing more than $13 million.
The proposed Biostatistics Core’s Development Project (DP-2) focuses on designing pragmatic clinical trials
with multivariate outcomes. The project is innovative because such trials, which are becoming increasingly
common, often do not take the correlation between outcomes into account in the design and/or analysis,
leading to less efficient designs and to estimates that fail to demonstrate the efficacy of treatments. This is
especially important for trials that include multiple primary outcomes assessing various aspects of a
multifactorial condition or intervention. The code from this and all novel methods developed by the BC will be
made publicly available, including through the Gerontologic Research Algorithms and Statistical Programs
(GRASP) website."
10909353,"Under the leadership of Drs. Leng and Pajewski, the WF OAIC Biostatistics and Research Information
Systems Core (BIC) will build on its long-term success in biostatistical collaboration and expand
statistics/informatics tools tailored to research in aging. The proposed Core is comprised of a team of highly
qualified investigators and staff with the full range of expertise relevant to the WF OAIC mission, including design
and management of observational studies and randomized trials, centralized data entry and processing,
centralized and decentralized data management, statistical analysis of data from complex study designs and data
sources and development of novel statistical methods. The BIC has added additional expertise in machine
learning and analysis considerations for pragmatic studies leveraging the electronic health record.
The BIC members are committed to the WF OAIC’s programmatic aims to: 1) discover new pathways
contributing to age-related declines in physical function and disability risk; 2) develop, evaluate, and refine
strategies for disability prevention and treatment; 3) translate proven strategies beyond the traditional research
environments; and 4) train the next generation of research leaders focused on disability treatment and
prevention. In close collaboration with all other OAIC cores, we propose four Specific Aims:
 1. To participate as investigators for WF OAIC projects including: 4 Pilot Studies, 2 Developmental
 Projects, and 8 Externally-funded Projects related to WF OAIC aims and themes. As co-investigators,
 BIC members are actively involved in study design and conduct. Their roles include recruitment
 monitoring, randomization, and safety monitoring; sample size determination; data management;
 statistical analysis and interpretation; and presentation/publication of results.
 2. To play an integral role in training OAIC-supported scholars in the design, planning, conduct, and
 analysis and interpretation of aging-related research projects.
The BIC will also extend its strong record of innovative discovery and evaluation through Specific Aims 3
and 4, which are to:
 3. Develop novel statistical applications & methods development for analytical issues associated with
 aging research.
 4. Develop unique research information systems to facilitate biomarker initiatives for aging studies.
 To accommodate the growing scope and constant evolution of aging-relevant biomarkers, during Years
 1-2, we will build a novel, flexible, structured approach to storage and sharing of biomarker data within our
 time-tested, state-of-the-art data management system."
10916504,"The overall goal of the Pilot/Exploratory Studies Core (PESC) is to support and facilitate innovative and rigor-
ous research that will enhance our understanding of the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention, conse-
quences, and management of multifactorial geriatric conditions (the focus of the Yale OAIC), leading ultimately
to the development of interventions to increase or maintain independence in older persons. The Leader of the
PESC, Dr. Albert Shaw, is nationally recognized for his research on aging of the human immune system. He
holds a K24 award from the NIA focused on immunosenescence, is MPI of the Yale Infectious Diseases NIH
training grant, and is the current chair of a standing NIH study section on vaccines. These activities give him an
exceptional overview of aging research. Dr. Shaw will work closely with the Co-Leader of the PESC, Dr. Terri
Fried, a leader in research on clinical decision-making in older persons. The Specific Aims of the PESC are to:
(1) solicit and select the most meritorious research proposals for PESC funding; (2) provide investigators of
PESC studies with access to resources from the Operations (RC1) and Biostatistics (RC2) Cores; (3) facilitate
potential opportunities for collaboration among PESC investigators; (4) monitor the progress of PESC studies;
(5) facilitate development of PESC studies into independently funded grant applications; and (6) ensure the
safety and protection of human subjects and vertebrate animals enrolled in PESC studies. In addition to one-
year $40,000 pilot/exploratory studies (PESs), we will continue an Expedited Pilot (EXPI) grant program, which
will fund small grants (capped at $5000) that are awarded within 4 weeks. These grants are intended for re-
search activities in which a rapid infusion of a relatively small amount of funds will facilitate a successful extra-
mural grant application. PESs and EXPI awards will take full advantage of the resources and expertise availa-
ble from the OAIC’s two Resource Cores. Priority for PESC funding will be given to early-stage investigators
who are transitioning to independence, including the growing number of prior REC Scholars. By facilitating ac-
cess to the OAIC research infrastructure, these PESC awards will continue to foster the development of exter-
nal grants that will advance our understanding of multifactorial geriatric conditions. During the current funding
cycle, the PESC invested $625,000 (total costs) that has resulted, to date, in 92 publications and $14.6 million
in extramural funding (total costs). During Year 1 of the next cycle, three innovative PESs will be supported
from early-stage physician scientists: PES-1—Age-associated alterations in NLRP3 inflammasome function in
the setting of COVID-19 (PI, Heidi Zapata, MD, PhD); PES-2—Evaluating short-term outcomes of surveillance
mammography among older women with a history of breast cancer (PI, Ilana Richman, MD, MHS); and PES-
3—Transcriptomic signatures of microglia in age-related macular degeneration and Alzheimer’s Disease (PI,
Brian Hafler, MD, PhD). These pilots, which will each advance our theme, encapsulate the strength and diver-
sity of the environment for basic, translational and clinical aging research fostered by the Yale OAIC."
10909355,"The Bioimaging Resource Core (BRC) is a critical component of the Wake Forest Older Americans
Independence Center (WF OAIC). It provides leadership, scientific expertise, and instrumental support in
quantitative imaging, including CT, MRI, DXA, PET, and ultrasound, critical to the WF OAIC’s research theme:
Integrating pathways affecting physical function for new approaches to disability treatment and prevention. The
BRC is well integrated with other OAIC cores and supports investigators’ use of imaging to characterize body
and brain structure and function. In the present cycle, the BRC facilitated 4 OAIC scholars, 8 pilot and
development projects, contributed to 80 original papers, and 19 new NIH awards, including 5 to early-career
investigators. The BRC and the WF OAIC Biostatistics and Research Information Systems Core partnered with
the WF Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center to harmonize storage, processing, archiving, and access of
imaging data for body and brain to facilitate research integrating the biology of aging and mobility with brain
health. The BRC also developed, validated, and implemented innovative image acquisition and analysis
methods for muscle, fat, bone, and brain phenotypes.
The Specific Aims of the BRC for the new cycle are to: 1) Support pilot, development, and externally-funded
research projects with quantitative imaging phenotypes for use in observational and intervention research
evaluating factors affecting pathways to mobility disability; 2) Develop and validate new imaging measures
relevant to pathways affecting physical function. These will include trabecular and cortical bone
microarchitecture acquired with a new high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-
pQCT) scanner; CT-radiomics of muscle, fat, and bone; “CT-body-age” and “MRI-brain-age” and functional
brain network metrics associated with mobility; and 3) Apply imaging techniques in support of WF OAIC
programmatic goals by: training researchers focused on disability treatment and prevention to integrate
imaging methods; collaborating with other OAIC cores to develop multidisciplinary, translational projects; and
disseminating data and methods for use by the national research community. In the first year of the next cycle,
BRC will support 16 studies including 1 BRC-led research Development Project, 2 Pilot studies (1 led by a
REC Scholar), and 13 Externally-funded studies.
The BRC will be led by three highly experienced, independently successful investigators: Leon Lenchik, MD,
Christina Hugenschmidt, PhD and Ashley Weaver, PhD. They have complementary skills and expertise and
strong records of collaborative scientific and administrative achievements. They will ensure the achievement of
the BRC goals and its contributions to the overall success of the WF OAIC."
10916506,"The objective of the Research Education Core (REC) is to identify highly promising early-stage investigators
and provide support to promote their development as independent investigators and leaders in aging research.
The REC seeks to provide three groups of investigators, designated as REC Scholars, Small REC Awardees,
and REC Affiliates, with the knowledge and skills to conduct biological, translational, and clinical studies of
multifactorial geriatric conditions and to obtain subsequent funding from a broad range of sources. The out-
comes and career advancement goals for the REC investigators include: 1) publication of research results in
high-impact journals; 2) success in obtaining independent funding, both to support further career development
and specific research projects; and 3) development of leadership skills necessary to manage research teams,
become successful mentors, and assume leadership roles in the OAIC and their departments/divisions.
 This renewal application builds upon the successful experiences of the current and prior funding cycles in
nurturing faculty from both geriatric medicine and a variety of medical subspecialties, including both physicians
and PhD investigators. We will expand upon the advances in the current cycle to support investigators pursu-
ing basic and translational research programs, in addition to those pursuing clinical research programs, en-
couraging them to embrace the complexities of multifactorial geriatric conditions. The inclusion of three groups
of REC investigators will allow us to provide support to an expanded group of early-stage investigators. The
REC Scholars will receive (1) the most extensive financial support to protect their time for conducting research
and (2) priority access to the Resource Cores to conduct OAIC-supported projects. The Small REC Awardees
will receive more modest financial support with the goal of developing strong candidates for subsequent REC
Scholar awards or other funding. REC Affiliates will not receive project funding but will have access to all REC
didactic and career development activities. All three groups of REC investigators will receive research and ca-
reer development support in a number of key areas, including: 1) appropriate mentorship in aging/geriatrics,
especially for trainees new to aging research and/or in fields outside of geriatric medicine; 2) a didactic curricu-
lum addressing key skills and knowledge necessary for the study of multifactorial geriatric conditions; 3) a cur-
riculum to support the transition to independent funding and build leadership skills; 4) regular research-in-pro-
gress meetings to present their own work and to learn from the experiences of other early-stage investigators;
5) additional research meetings to learn from more experienced investigators; 6) a day-long career develop-
ment retreat focused on aging-related research; 7) regular updates regarding research meetings, career devel-
opment activities, and funding opportunities both within and outside of Yale; and 8) mentorship and Resource
Core support for the development and writing of larger scale grant applications. We will identify and support a
diverse array of early-stage investigators, including those from under-represented groups."
10909357,"Effective pilot and exploratory studies (PES) provide critical preliminary data to support successful research
proposals, particularly for early-career investigators who also need guidance in designing research studies and
writing study proposals. The Wake Forest OAIC Pilot and Exploratory Studies Core (PESC) has been
highly effective, managing a robust portfolio of PES aligned with the WF OAIC theme, ranging from basic
science studies examining biomolecular pathways to the development and testing of innovative approaches to
characterize and improve physical function. During the current cycle, PESC has been extremely productive,
leading to 19 external grant awards totaling $18.9 million and 115 PESC-related publications. In the next
cycle, the PESC proposes will continue our highly successful, coordinated, multi-faceted group efforts to
promote PES; implement new innovations to promote multidisciplinary research, and further refine processes.
The overall PESC goal is to enable investigators to develop key information needed for the design of
definitive, externally funded, translational research studies that promote the WF OAIC mission to
understand pathways influencing physical function and to develop new approaches to disability prevention and
treatment. This will be achieved by executing the following Specific Aims: 1) Identify and promote promising
areas of aging research; 2) Identify and recruit talented early-career and selected other investigators from
aging and complementary fields to focus on OAIC-themed research, in concert with the Research Education
Component (REC); 3) Solicit and facilitate competitive research proposals, provide constructive feedback, and
conduct expert peer review to select proposals with the best science and career development opportunities, 4)
Coach and mentor investigator teams to maximize the success and impact of research projects; 5) Team with
other WF OAIC cores to facilitate successful completion of the selected pilot projects and mentor early-career
investigators to advance their development as successful translational scientists; and 6) Continuously
evaluate, refine, and optimize OAIC PESC processes and procedures.
Under the continuing leadership of Drs. Kitzman and Register, the PESC will support 4 innovative pilot
projects in the first year, all led by talented early- and mid-career investigators, including REC Scholars and
investigators new to aging. They extensively use OAIC cores and represent the full range of translational
science to address physical function and disability in older persons. These include: testing feasibility of a novel
home-based exercise program in older rural cardiac rehab patients; assessing relationships between vision,
brain networks, and physical function; examining the effects of metformin on mitochondrial function and
physical performance; and exploring relationships between circulating muscle-specific exosomes and physical
function. All projects align with the OAIC mission of promoting independence through discovery and innovation."
10932929,"The opioid epidemic remains a major public health crisis in the US, with relapse rates and overdose-related
fatalities continuing to rise. However, the mechanistic explorations of viable interventions in individuals with
opioid use disorder have been particularly scarce. Here we will explore a novel brain-based intervention to
decrease craving in individuals with heroin use disorder (iHUD) in early treatment. A core characteristic of drug
addiction is an enhanced reactivity to drug related cues and reduced processing of other reinforcers in the natural
environment, as reliably observed across numerous brain networks and associated with enhanced craving (a
predictor of drug use outside the lab). Our recent studies in iHUD suggest that this brain-behavior cue-induced
biased pattern improves with abstinence/treatment. Therefore, we will test whether preemptively changing such
neural cue reactivity could expedite the recovery process as measured with reduced drug craving. Specifically,
we hypothesize that training can help iHUD achieve an intentional modulation of their cue reactivity signal. Using
one’s own brain signal, real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rt-fMRI NF) allows participants to volitionally modulate
brain activity in targeted brain regions shown in smokers and heavy alcohol drinkers to be effective in reducing
drug cue neural reactivity, as associated with abstinence/decreases in craving. However, the permeability of this
approach is not uniform. Here for the first time, we will test whether the NF effect can be enhanced by using the
signal derived from the brains of others (i.e., brain-to-brain neural transmission). Specifically, our first aim in this
cutting-edge exploratory application is to identify the brain regions that distinguish between early (abstinent for
<1 month) as compared to later (abstinent for >3 months) time-in-treatment in iHUD. Our second aim is to use
the unique multivariate neural patterns derived later in treatment as NF provided to a newly recruited sample of
iHUD in early treatment, with the goal of increasing neuronal coupling between both groups. To increase
ecological validity and better approximate actual real-world experiences in iHUD, the stimulus is a dynamic,
narrative-based, and context-rich movie. Our working hypothesis is that, as compared to iHUD in early treatment
where drug cue reactivity is more automatic and harder to control (impacting non drug processing), recovering
individuals are better able to regulate it allowing them to reduce craving (and curtail, or entirely eliminate, drug-
seeking) even in potent drug-related situations. Therefore, during rt-fMRI NF, we expect greater recovery (and
lower cue-induced craving) in the new sample of iHUD early in treatment who show the most neural
coupling/alignment with the neural patterns of those in later recovery. In short, in this innovative R21 proposal
we will answer the following question: Can the neural patterns of addicted individuals in later recovery be used
to provide scaffolding for the nascent recovery process early in treatment, helping to reduce craving? Results of
this proof-of-concept study can be used in later longitudinal studies to develop real-time NF-based training to
improve outcomes in iHUD as generalizable to other substance use disorders."
10845654,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Ultraviolet B light (UVB; 280-315nm) is a common environmental trigger that can induce skin
inflammation and flares in several autoimmune diseases. UVB light is an established trigger for skin flares in
SLE patients, and regional spikes in atmospheric UVB intensity correlate with flare frequency among SLE
patients within that geographic region. In mice, IgE antibodies are elevated after UVB exposure, and previous
work shows that skin-reactive IgE also plays a key role in removing damaged keratinocytes after carcinogen
exposure. However, the role of self-reactive IgE has not been studied in photosensitivity reactions in
autoimmunity.
 Regulatory T (Treg) cells play a central role in maintaining immune system homeostasis and modulating
immune responses. Foxp3 is a master regulator of Treg development and function. FOXP3 mutations in patients
with IPEX (Immunodysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked syndrome), which result in a
deficiency in Tregs, result in lethal autoimmunity, similar to the disease observed in Foxp3 deficient mice. While
highly conserved in both amino acid sequence and gene structure, one difference between humans and mice is
that the human FOXP3 gene encodes two major alternatively spliced isoforms: a full-length version that uses
all 10 exons (FOXP3FL, the only isoform in mice) and a shorter isoform lacking exon 2 (FOXP3∆E2). Recent
studies have shown that Tregs from patients with some autoimmune diseases express increased levels of the
∆E2 isoform compared to those from healthy donors. Consistent with this finding, we have found that Tregs from
SLE patients have increased expression of the FOXP3∆E2 isoform.
 To study the role of the ∆E2 isoform in Treg function we generated a new mouse strain with Foxp3 exon
2 deletion. Interestingly, we found that Foxp3∆E2 mice develop hallmark features of SLE, including anti-DNA
and anti-nuclear autoantibodies, increased number and size of spontaneous germinal centers and kidney
deposition of antibody complexes, by 4-5 weeks of age. Importantly, these mice display a marked increase in
circulating IgE and develop IgE-specific autoantibodies against skin antigens, including Keratins 2 and 14. In
addition, these mice have IgE deposits in the skin, which increase dramatically following UVB irradiation. Our
central hypothesis is Foxp3DE2-expressing Tregs fail to regulate germinal center responses and
promote IgE autoantibodies. To test this hypothesis, we will first determine the role of Foxp3∆Ex2-expressing
Tregs in germinal center function, focusing on the relationship between Tfh and Tfr cells. Next, we will assess
the role of autoreactive IgE in UVB-mediated skin inflammation in these mice. These studies will provide
insights into the role of Foxp3∆E2 Treg function and the development and progression of inflammatory skin
disease."
10898743,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Black sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth demonstrate higher rates of suicidal ideation and behavior than
White SGM youth and Black cisgender heterosexual youth. However, limited research has examined racial,
sexual, and gender identities as they co-occur and intersect to result in experiences producing suicide risk and
protection among Black SGM youth. Further, suicide research often lacks intercategorical comparisons needed
to understand suicide risk and protection across subgroups of Black SGM youth, limited research has
examined Black SGM-specific protective factors as moderators of suicide risk, and most research has relied on
single method inquiries that limit understanding of the constellation of factors associated with suicide risk
among Black SGM youth over time and across a week. We propose to conduct a multi-level, multi-component
mixed-methods, longitudinal study to examine how intersectional minority stress and Black SGM-specific
protective factors affect active suicide ideation over time, day-to-day, and within specific contexts within and
between populations of Black SGM youth. We will pursue the following specific aims: (1) To examine the
moderating effects of intersectional Black SGM-specific individual and community protective factors on
theoretical pathways of risk, including intersectional minority stress, over time; (2) To identify and describe
proximal correlates of suicide risk, including protective factors, among Black SGM youth; and (3) To explore in-
depth the effects of contextual factors on suicide risk among Black SGM youth. We will recruit 625 Black SGM
youth aged 13 to 26 in the U.S. via social media marketing and impose sampling quotas based on SGM
identity (lesbian, gay, bisexual women, bisexual men, transgender/nonbinary) and age (13-17yrs, 18-21yrs, 22-
26yrs). All participants will complete an online survey every 3 months over 18-months. For Aim 1, we will
perform stratified latent trajectory moderated mediation analyses for SGM groups separately to examine
associations between intersectional discrimination across time as a predictor of change in entrapment and
psychopathology, which in turn predicts changes in the trajectory of active suicide ideation across time. We
hypothesize that individual protective factors will moderate the trajectory of discrimination across time, while
community protective factors will moderate trajectories of psychological vulnerabilities. We also will examine
moderating effects of structural factors. For Aim 2, a subsample of 450 participants will complete 1 of 3 daily
diary surveys over the study period to examine cross-level interactions between person-level protective factors
and day-level risk factors predicting suicide ideation across SGM groups at the daily level. Aim 3 involves
conducting individual interviews with a subset of 180 participants across SGM identities and age groups to
glean insights into contextual factors associated with increasing/decreasing suicide risk. This research will help
address social injustices that characterize mental health disparities among Black SGM youth by identifying
modifiable Black SGM-specific protective factors that will inform future tailored strengths-based interventions."

 A key feature of the COVID-19 infection is the vast inter-individual heterogeneity in the
severity of the infection. The complex biological mechanisms that underlie this variability remain
mostly obscure. We propose to provide a mechanistic understanding of this susceptibility by
leveraging 3 key innovations: First, we have developed a 3-dimensional lung culture system
that allows for detailed interrogation of the early events in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Second, we
have established an animal model of COVID-19 in mice transgenic for the human ACE2
receptor in our facility. Third, we have built a multi-scale mathematical model of lung infection in
COVID-19, that we now seek to expand and personalize to individual hosts. We have two Aims
in this project: In Aim 1, we will validate, expand, and personalize our existing multi-scale
model, using an unbiased approach to identify and test hypotheses relating to susceptibility to
severe COVID-19, and in Aim 2 we will test a specific hypothesis regarding the mechanism of
the observed inter-individual heterogeneity in COVID-19 severity, namely that it is, in part,
mediated by divergent activation of the mTOR pathway in type I alveolar epithelial cells. If
successful, this project will identify the biological basis of the immune pathways that result in
heterogeneous outcome of COVID-19, paving the way for personalized, host-specific
interventions to improve the outcome of the infection."

Mendelian randomization (MR) is a widely applicable causal inference technique that makes it possible to estimate causal effects using only summary association statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In recent years, MR has moved from being relatively unknown to a common element of post-GWAS analysis. By facilitating causal inference without a randomized trial, MR makes it possible to rapidly and cheaply assess potential risk factors for human disease. However, most MR methods rely on strong, sometimes unrealistic assumptions. When assumptions are violated, MR will produce biased, misleading results. The goals of this proposal are to 1) develop robust MR statistical methods that address the most crucial problems that arise in analysis of real data sets and 2) develop accessible open-source software to guide a user through the practical challenges of performing MR. We focus on two shortcomings of existing MR methods. First, horizontal pleiotropy is a well-known source of bias in MR. State-of-the-art MR methods are more robust to some types of horizontal pleiotropy than traditional methods. However, there are some forms of horizontal pleiotropy that can only be accounted for by augmenting the analysis with data for confounding variables via multivariable MR (MVMR). Current MVMR methods can only accommodate a few additional variables, while many problems would be best addressed by including larger numbers of traits. In Aim 1, we develop an MVMR method that is computationally scalable and remains accurate when large numbers of traits are included. In Aim 2, we extend this work, developing a method to automatically identify variables that should be included in an MVMR analysis. This is particularly important for understanding the causal role of exposures that have been sparsely studied or have only recently become measurable. In Aim 3, we focus on the challenges posed by linkage disequilibrium (LD). The majority of existing methods rely on LO-pruning variants to obtain an independent set, leading to a loss of valuable information. All current methods assume that LD is the same in the exposure and outcome GWAS. This assumption will not always hold, leading to errors that bias causal estimates. To address these problems, we develop an efficient screening tool to alert users when mis-matching LD may be affecting the results and an LD-aware MR method that can accommodate different LD patterns in exposure and outcome. The methods developed in this proposal will be distributed in user-friendly open-source software. Because the goals of Aims 1-3 are complimentary, in Aim 4 we will integrate these tools into an umbrella software package that guides users through the multiple choices involved in performing MR, from data selection and formatting to interpretion of results. The goal of this package is to address data considerations that are often ignored in methodological research, enabling investigators to obtain more robust, reliable inference."

The gram-negative outer membrane (OM) represents a strong permeability barrier that impedes the entry of
many antibiotics. The majority of the species the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention list as of
“urgent” or “serious” concern for antibiotic resistance are gram-negative in part due to the impermeability of the
OM. In recent years, it has become clear that the permeability of the OM can be altered by the physiological
state of the cell. Specifically, clinically relevant stresses such as nutrient limitation can result in strengthening of
the OM permeability barrier, further decreasing the entry of antibiotics. Elucidation of the pathways responsible
for this strengthening will lead to new targets for the development of small molecules that can weaken the OM
permeability barrier. The laboratory’s long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms that change the
permeability of the OM during periods of clinically relevant stress.
Specifically, this project aims to elucidate a novel link between loss of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) and
alteration of OM permeability in Escherichia coli K12. MMR is a highly conserved DNA repair mechanism found
throughout all domains of life. MMR mutants have been found in clinical antibiotic resistant strains and have
been proposed to be an antecedent to the development of resistance mutations facilitated by an increased
mutation rate. However, preliminary data demonstrate a second pathway where loss of MMR leads to resistance
to a broad range of antibiotics through alteration of OM permeability. Thus, loss of MMR in a host environment
would allow bacteria to survive antibiotics treatment longer, while also increasing the probability that a specific
resistance mutation can develop due to the increased mutation rate. The SOS DNA damage stress response
pathway is not necessary for strengthening the OM permeability barrier demonstrating that a novel pathway
connects loss of MMR to OM permeability.
The central hypothesis of this work is loss of MMR activates a novel pathway involving signal transduction and
transcriptional changes that alter the permeability profile of the OM. This project will elucidate genes involved in
this pathway by identifying transcriptional changes that result from pathway activation leading to altered OM
permeability (Aim 1) and determining the genes that are necessary for the pathway to altered OM permeability
(Aim 2). Completion of the aims will transform understanding of the link between DNA repair and OM
permeability and has the potential to uncover new targets for drug discovery."

KRAS operates as a molecular switch that oscillates between an active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound
state. Active KRAS proteins are required to localize to the plasma membrane within a defined lipid environment
to be functional. Oncogenic KRAS induces metabolic dependence on aerobic glycolysis, a phenomenon known
as the Warburg effect. We recently discovered that aerobic glycolysis, by generating a subset of outer leaflet
glycosphingolipids (GSL), controls KRAS plasma membrane (PM) interactions and therefore KRAS
oncogenesis. Blocking GSL metabolism, using multiple methods including glucose deletion, pharmacological
inhibition and genetic deletion of selected GSL synthetic enzymes all mislocalize KRAS from the PM. Deletion
of key enzymes of the GSL biosynthetic pathways abrogated KRAS oncogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Building
on these exciting findings, we developed our central hypothesis: that a subset of defined glycosphingolipids
regulates localization and nanoscale organization of KRAS through controlling the lipid composition on the PM
and lipid transport at PM-ER membrane contact sites. We will test to what extent do GSLs operate as spatial
organizers of the inner PM and ER-PM contacts sites in Aim1 by using a variety of lipid biosensor and high-
resolution imaging. In Aim 2, we will employ genetic approaches, lipid reconstitution experiments and
molecular dynamics simulation to probe the potential mechanism of inter leaflet coupling between outer leaflet
GSLs and inner leaflet phosphatidylserine on the PM. Finally, in Aim 3 we will rigorously test the relevance of
this novel glycosphingolipid-centered mechanism in multiple mouse KRAS cancer models. In sum, using a
multidisciplinary approach, this proposal will yield new insights into the molecular mechanism of how surface
GSLs regulate PM lipid composition and lipid transport, and the role of inter leaflet lipid coupling. This is highly
significant to basic membrane biology and biophysics. The connection of GSL metabolism through PM lipid
organization to KRAS function will identify a novel vulnerability to KRAS oncogenesis that may have
therapeutic potential."
