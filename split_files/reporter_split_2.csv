Organogenesis is a process in which biochemical signals and mechanical cues transform embryonic germ layers
into organs during fetal development. With recent advancements in stem cell biology, it has become possible to
differentiate human pluripotent stem cells into expandable 3D tissues that contain many of the cellular and
functional characteristics of fetal organs. These so-called organoids hold a tremendous potential to answer
longstanding questions of human organogenesis and to one day serve as a renewable source of patient-specific
human tissues. However, human organoids still only approximatively recapitulate organogenesis as they rely
on spontaneous tissue self-organization and the establishment of signaling gradients in unpredictable ways.
Furthermore, available organoid protocols focus on single organs and do not focus on morphogenesis. We be-
lieve that making a meaningful progress in the field demands 1), gaining a deeper understanding of the coupling
between signaling networks, tissue-specific transcriptional signatures, and tissue morphogenesis and 2), devel-
oping novel cross-disciplinary tools that control spatiotemporal signaling to accurately mimic organogenesis in
vitro. This proposal aims precisely to advance these gaps in our knowledge. We focus on the organogenesis of
the gut tube, the embryonic structure on which many adjacent organs form, from thymus and lungs to the colon.
Breaking away from the current organoid paradigms, which heavily rely on self-organization and the establish-
ment of often uncontrolled internal gradients, we will combine tissue micropatterning and microfluidics to gen-
erate precise signaling gradients so to reproducibly mimic both the signaling and the morphogenesis of gut tube
organogenesis in vitro. Combined with live-cell microscopy, CRISPR editing, and single cell transcriptomics our
organoids will reveal a detailed hierarchy of fate choices cells make from pluripotency to regionally specialized
tissues in the gut tube, and they will allow us to make crucial connections between signaling, transcriptional
regulation, and tissue morphogenesis. Our work will shed light on the largely unknown regulatory mechanisms
by which the complex signaling pathways interact to create asymmetric patterns along the body axes. For the
first time, our approach will recapitulate the formation of multiple adjacent gut tube progenitors from an em-
bryonic germ layer, providing a unique window into one of longstanding questions in developmental biology:
how do continuous signals create discretely separated organs along body axes? Finally, in collaboration with
CRISPR experts, we will generate a pipeline that bypasses traditional morphogen-driven differentiation of plu-
ripotent cells, but instead uses inducible genetic circuits to mimic fate decisions. This novel system will have the
capacity to generate highly precise human tissues on the fly, in an approach that can be termed synthetic organ-
ogenesis. Our proposed work will open routes to studying long elusive molecular mechanisms of early human
organogenesis and start bridging the crucial gap between organoid biology and regenerative medicine."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression is one of the most debilitating diseases worldwide, and the social and economic burden is a major public health challenge. Childhood maltreatment is a common risk factor for depression and when present further compromises adaptive functioning. Important clinical differences exist between depression with and without maltreatment, suggesting that they constitute two distinct phenotypes and require different treatment guidelines. Preliminary data from genetic and neurobiological studies in adults also support this notion. The aim of this proposal is to determine whether adolescents with depression and a history of maltreatment have distinct differences in structural and functional neural circuits compared to depressed adolescents without maltreatment. The study will focus on adolescence because, except for infancy, it is the greatest period of neural change and maturation, and the effects of maltreatment on the brain appear during this developmental stage. Four groups will be recruited: adolescents with clinical depression and a history of childhood maltreatment, adolescents with clinical depression and no maltreatment history, adolescents with no psychiatric disorder but have a history of childhood maltreatment, and adolescents with no psychiatric disorder or maltreatment history. The participants will undergo structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging studies to measure macro- and micro-structural connectivity/tractography profiles in key neural networks that are associated with core symptoms of depression (specifically the fronto-limbic circuit for negative mood and the fronto-striatal circuit for anhedonia). They will undergo resting-state and task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging studies to measure functional connectivity profiles in these neural networks. In addition to identifying group differences between the two depression subtypes/phenotypes, we will assess whether maltreatment moderates the associations between dimensional ratings of specific depressive symptom profiles (e.g., anhedonia, negative affect, rumination) and neural circuits. To our knowledge, this study is the first to utilize multi-modal imaging to differentiate structural and functional neural substrates associated with the combination of depression and maltreatment relative to those associated with depression. The four group (2 x 2) design will enable us to determine if the observed differences between the two depressed groups are a function of a main (additive) effect of maltreatment or an interaction effect (i.e., the neural characteristics associated with depression are altered by maltreatment). The results of the study will increase our understanding of the existing neural models of depression and have the potential to improve clinical practice by enhancing treatment guidelines and algorithms. Differentiation of the neural markers associated with the two depression subtypes could be used to predict treatment outcome more effectively and to more selectively index clinical responses to treatment. Identifying the unique neural substrates associated with depression in victims of maltreatment would also facilitate the development and testing of new treatments for those who do not respond well to current approaches (as observed in some clinical trials)."

Mononegavirales is a taxonomic order of viruses, so classified for their negative sense single
stranded RNA genome and their pleomorphic membrane-enveloped virions. Mononegavirus life
cycles involve a number of different events, including entry of virions into host cells, viral mRNA
transcription, genome replication and virus assembly, and viral budding from host cells. These
events are carried out through molecular interactions between virus and host cell machinery;
elucidating these interactions is key to understanding viral life cycles and identifying potential
therapeutic targets.
Studies of viral machinery are typically limited to isolated particles or assemblies; this removes
them from their native environments and strips away important molecular interactions. To
preserve biological context, viral machinery must be studied in situ, i.e. under near-native
conditions, such as within intact virions or cells. These environments are a complex, disordered
mixture of molecules, making it particularly difficult to obtain molecular resolution information.
Here, we propose to study three mononegaviruses: measles, rabies, and Ebola viruses. Each
serve as prototypical viruses for their taxonomic families, and each are pathogens important to
global health.
To carry out our proposed research, we will use and develop in situ structural biology methods.
Our primary method will be cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), a type of cryo-electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) that allows for visualization of three-dimensional volumes. This
overcomes the typical cryo-EM requirement of thin monolayers of purified particles, allowing for
the acquisition of molecular-resolution information in near-native environments. We will develop
data collection and computational methods for cryo-ET to enable rapid, automated data
collection, high-resolution structure determination, and accurate molecular identification. We will
also use and develop methods complementary to cryo-ET including focused ion-beam milling
and correlative light and electron microscopy approaches.
Our research will provide novel biological insights three important viruses, but more broadly, it
will demonstrate a transformative approach for studying viruses. Rather than trying to tease
apart function and interactions through indirect biochemical means, our research will provide an
infrastructure to directly observe the virus and host cell machinery with complete biological
contexts under near-native conditions."

Normal nervous system function depends on proper communications between neurons and non-neuronal cells.
In the human brain, the majority of non-neuronal cells are called glia that consist of nearly half of total brain cells.
Despite decades of work focusing on neurons and glia alone, how they communicate with each other remains
poorly understood. This is partly due to a dearth of methods to comprehensively profile molecules that are
enriched at the neuron-glial interface during dynamic cell-cell interactions. This proposal aims to develop a
genetically-guided proteomic toolbox to spatiotemporally profile critical molecules enriched at neuron-glial
interface in vivo, allowing for molecular and genetic dissection of neuron-glial interactions. We will first design
and generate glial-specific cell surface proximity-labeling probes with the spatiotemporal precision. We will apply
this platform in the oligodendrocytes, the sole myelin-producing cells in the central nervous system (CNS), to
determine the molecular mechanisms governing the initiation of oligodendrocyte-axon ensheathment. We will
leverage this new method, along with single-cell RNA sequencing, genome-wide CRISPR screens, and novel
transgenic mouse strains, to interrogate a mysterious cell stage (the pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes) during
developmental and adaptive myelination. To extend the glial surface proximity labeling toolkit, we will develop a
neuron-glial complementary proximity labeling system allowing for visualization of transient neuron-glial
interactions and capture of molecules only enriched at neuron-glial interface in vivo. Using this system we will
address the molecular codes governing myelination selectivity between subsets of oligodendrocytes and
functionally distinct neuronal subpopulations. This proposed work will fulfill the knowledge gap in myelin biology,
and will have broader implications in understanding neuron-glial and glia-glial interaction mechanisms in general.
The methods and reagents established by the work will also greatly enrich the methods in studying diverse cell-
cell communications, including neuro-immune and cancer-immune interactions."

Mammalian cell biology happens in 3 dimensions. Advances in high-throughput genomics and cellular profiling
âomics methods have made massively-parallel cell biology experiments routine for many labs, but the vast
majority of these studies in human cells have been limited to homogeneous 2-dimensional models. This
drastically reduces the range of cell types and interactions that can be studied ex vivo. And, despite advances
in the growth of organoids and microtissues for the study of human biology in 3D, next generation âomics
approaches still require the dissociation of these structures and the destruction of their cells to extract
biomolecules for study. Researchers need tools that can interrogate human biology at scale and in situ to
generate rich phenotyping data from single cells while still preserving complex spatial relationships and
interactions between cells in 3D. The lack of such tools is a major limitation in biomedical research. Here I
propose a technology that combines the discovery potential of genome scale screening with the information
content of high-dimensional single-cell profiling, with full integration of 3D spatial information to enable rich in
situ phenotypic readout of complex cellular phenomena at scale."

Asthma and allergic diseases are among the most common chronic diseases in children and adults, costing
our health care system over $80 billion per year. Rates have been increasing over the past 40 years and
therapeutic advances have been incremental. Over 150 loci have been reported in large genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) of asthma and allergic diseases, but their individual effects are small and these
variants account a small fraction of the overall genetic risk. Moreover, remarkably few of the GWAS findings for
asthma and allergic diseases have led to discoveries of causal variants or causal genes that contribute to
asthma and allergic disease pathogenesis. The latter has been particularly challenging due in part to the
significant clinical heterogeneity of these diseases, and in part to the lag in the development of powerful
statistical, molecular, and immunologic tools for bridging the trajectory from GWAS to gene discovery to
biology to translation. In this application, we propose a robust and comprehensive strategy for identifying
candidate causal variants and their target genes at asthma and allergic disease-associated loci, and for
characterizing (i) their functional effects in asthma and allergic disease-relevant cells types, including bronchial
epithelial cells, airway smooth muscle and lung immune cells, as well as peripheral immune cells, all in resting
and activated states; (ii) their downstream phenotypic effects on both broad categories of disease groups and
traits in the UK Biobank resource and on specific asthma and allergic disease endotypes in deeply phenotyped
ethnically-diverse subjects participating in asthma birth cohorts; and (iii) their immunologic effects in resting
and activated lung lymphocytes and myeloid cells and in âhumanized locusâ BAC-engineered mouse models.
These goals will be accomplished through a highly collaborative and synergistic program that includes two
projects, a service core, and an administrative core that together will that bridge the trajectory from GWAS to
translation through highly integrated studies by an exceptional team of investigators with expertise in genetics,
(epi)genomics, statistical genetics, and immunology. Achieving these goals will ultimately identify novel drug
targets and the individuals most likely to respond, providing a framework for precision medicine and
personalized treatment of asthma and allergic diseases."
10513297,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
In the United States, approximately 3% of cancer patients are being treated in the Veterans Affairs Medical
Centers (VAMCs) each year, of which 11% are colon or rectal malignancies. Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains
a leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Although the overall survival for CRC patients with
advanced disease has been dramatically improved over the past decades, the most recently reported 5-year
survival rate for patients with stage IV CRC was lower than 14%. To date, there are only a few drugs approved
by the FDA to treat CRC patients with advanced disease. Along with new military personnel entering the VA
system, physician shortages, and extended lifespan of seniors, the demands on VA health care resources are
becoming significant. Therefore, developing more efficacious and safer therapeutics for treating veteran patients
could be an economical and feasible strategy to offset the pressure on the VAMCs due to the increasing needs
for VA health care.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to significantly reduce the incidence and risk
of death from CRC and other forms of cancer. Sulindac, in particular, has been shown to display strong efficacy
for the treatment of precancerous lesions in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis by reducing the size
and number of polyps as much as 60-70%. These observations are consistent with numerous preclinical studies
that have shown the ability of sulindac and other NSAIDs to inhibit tumorigenesis in various experimental animal
models involving either early or late-stage diseases. However, the cardiovascular toxicity associated with
cyclooxygenase/prostaglandin (COX/PGE) inhibition precludes the long-term use of NSAIDs for cancer
indications in the general population. Our preliminary studies support a novel notion that a low dose of sulindac
inhibits CRC cell invasion and metastasis with non-COX/PGE inhibition mechanisms involving select miRNAs.
Of interest, exosomal miR-17-5p (ES-miR-17-5p), for the first time, was found to act as one of the key mediators
targeted and modulated by sulindac to intervene in pre-metastatic niche formation. These data provide an
innovative insight into the potential of utilizing low dose sulindac to prevent and block CRC metastatic
progression, which has not yet been studied exclusively. We hypothesize that ES-miR-17-5p is intimately
involved in the molecular mechanism by which low dose sulindac can delay and potentially block CRC distant
metastasis. Three specific aims are proposed in pursuit of our premise to demonstrate a new indication of low
dose sulindac in control of metastatic CRC. In Aim 1, we will study a new mechanism involving ES-miR-17-5p
in order to understand the inhibitory activity of sulindac in CRC cell motility; in Aim 2, we will determine the role
of ES-miR-17-5p in mediating the in vivo anti-metastatic activity of sulindac utilizing animal models; in Aim 3, we
will evaluate the clinical utility of miR-17-5p in predicting tumor progression with CRC specimen samples. We
expect that our study can support an efficacious and safe option to benefit the veterans with advanced CRC and
eventually improve the VA health care."

 The Cleveland Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (CADRC) is a collaborative effort of physicians
and investigators from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF),
MetroHealth System (MHS), University Hospitals (UH), and the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center
(LSCVAMC), to foster excellence in research and facilitate discovery as an established National Institute on
Aging (NIA) funded Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. The CADRC represents a rich clinical and research
community and an estimated 220,000 Ohioans who suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD) or AD-related
dementias (ADRD). The CADRC has 8 Cores and a Research Education Component designed to create the
foundation that will enhance the research efforts of the Northeast Ohio AD/ADRD research community, as well
as add unique value to the national Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRC) program and other
national and international research programs. The CADRC is focused on participants that will help us
understand the pathobiology of clinical and pathological heterogeneity observed in dementia including atypical
and amnestic AD, dementia with Lewy bodies, cognitively normal individuals with different levels of genetic risk
for AD, and diversity of participant populations (Clinical and Outreach, Recruitment, and Engagement Cores).
To support the CADRC goals, the focus will be on deep phenotyping of participants with longitudinal and
systematic cognitive, behavioral and motor characterization (Clinical Core), genetic and biofluid biomarker
collection and analysis (Biomarker Core), imaging (Neuroimaging Core), and autopsy after death
(Neuropathology Core). Results will be shared with the research community in a timely and regular manner to
allow other investigators to benefit from the CADRC efforts (Data Management and Statistics Core). In
addition, the CADRC will train the next generation of investigators utilizing a rigorous and well-designed
Research Education Component, support translation of new laboratory findings through the Translational
Therapeutics Core, and support high risk/high gain projects through the developmental program as a part of
the Administrative Core. The ultimate goals are to advance the precision medicine approach to dementia
diagnosis and treatment, support the development of early stage investigators, assist all stages of investigators
with tools for performing human-based research, and better engage underrepresented populations in
AD/ADRD research."

 Some proteins have the unique ability to sense and respond to mechanical force, a process called
mechanotransduction, and can confer mechanosensitivity to cells, tissue, or organelles that express them.
Sound waves in the ear, caress of a feather on the skin, or blood flow in arterial vessels are some instances
where a force-inducing stimulus such as vibration, pressure, or stretch activates mechanically activated (MA) ion
channels that initiate a cascade of events allowing the body to hear, sense touch, or regulate blood pressure. In
the past decade, identification of novel MA ion channels like PIEZOs, K2Ps, TMCs, and OSCA/TMEM63s has
revealed their importance in many physiological processes, but mechanistic details of how these channels sense
force is, strikingly, incomplete. A major challenge impeding the field in comprehending MA channel gating
mechanisms is the lack of a channel activation method that faithfully replicates the transduction of force, within
a physiological environment. This proposal aims to apply photoswitchable lipids as a new and innovative method
to assay mechanically activated (MA) ion channels, which will facilitate the study of these channels with greater
ease, precision, and detail.
 In vivo, mechanical stimulation exerts force, which alters tension within the cell membrane where
mechanosensitive proteins reside. MA ion channels detect this change in membrane tension leading to channel
activation. Traditional in vitro techniques to activate MA channels are rather crude including pushing on
membrane with a blunt glass probe or stretching the membrane by applying pressure. Although these techniques
to alter membrane tension have enabled measurement of MA channel activity, they are indirect, low-throughput,
and poorly mimic physiological stimuli. Here I propose to modulate membrane tension by directly targeting lipids
that encompass the channel using photoswitchable lipids (or photolipids). Incorporation of the photochromic
molecule azobenzene into fatty acyl chains provides optical control over lipids as they undergo cis-trans
isomerization when irradiated with UV-A and blue light. Therefore, azobenzene-modified lipids can be used to
reversibly manipulate membrane structure with light, which can either directly activate or modulate MA ion
channel activity. Using the bona-fide MA ion channel family OSCAs we will screen and optimize photolipids to
selectively change membrane properties on a cellular scale and assay MA channel activity with electrophysiology
and/or calcium imaging. This unique strategy will be combined with structural, functional, and pharmacological
studies to gain a better perspective on the cellular and molecular underpinnings of MA ion channel functions.
Ultimately, this work will also lead to a deeper mechanistic understanding of mechanotransduction processes
that drive vital physiological and pathological states in humans."

This application has as its theme the integrins, their regulation and their contribution to the functional
responses of blood and vascular cells. The integrins of focus are Î±MÎ²2 (Mac-1), Î±IIbÎ²3, Î±VÎ²3, and Î±5Î²1
but findings should apply to broadly integrins. The cells of emphasis are vascular cells- endothelial cells,
smooth muscle cells and pericytes- and blood cells- leukocytes and platelets. On the blood cells, the
conjugation of Mac-1 on leukocytes and GPIb on platelets will be considered. Major emphasis will be
placed on the molecules that regulate integrin function- kindlins, talin and paxillin- to determine how they
collaborate to regulate integrin activation. The function of these cytoskeletal proteins independent of
integrin activating activity will also be dissected. The Program consists of three projects, each directed by
an accomplished faculty member at their home institutions, Cleveland Clinic, University Hospitals of
Cleveland and Case Western Reserve University which are all closely located and governed by
interinstitutional agreements. Dr. Edward F. Plow, Ph.D. will serve as Program Director and lead Project
1. This project deals with the mechanisms by which kindlin-2 regulates both integrin-dependent and
independent responses of blood vessel cells. Molecular, cellular and unique mouse models are all brought
to bear to determine how kindlin-2 serves as a master regulator of vascular cell responses. In Project 2,
Dr. Jun Qin will use high resolution structural approaches in combination with mutagenesis and cellular
studies to determine how talin regulate integrin activation and cooperates with kindlins and paxillin to gain
such novel insights. He will determine how talin interacts with actin to control organization of the
cytoskeleton. Dr. Daniel Simon, M.D. will lead Project 3 and will consider how engagement of integrin
Mac-1 on leukocytes and GPIb on platelets regulates the participation of these cells in inflammation and
thrombosis. His studies range from basic structural approaches to translational studies in mice and to
humans to provide insights into their thrombotic and inflammatory contributions to systemic lupus
erythematosus. The Program is supported by two Scientific Cores, Protein Expression and Purification
(Core B), and Animal Models and Tissue Analysis (Core C) as well as by an Administrative Core (AC1). A
common objective of the Program is to continue and create new collaborations among the Projects and
their Leaders to resolve the structural and biological mechanisms that regulate the functions of integrins in
blood and vascular cells. The information derived from these studies will provide insights into biologically
important responses regulated by integrins and their activation that are relevant to thrombosis and
cardiovascular diseases."

Abstract
NEI-supported investigators from Duke University request continuing support for a Center Core Grant for
Vision Research. Research areas covered by this group range from basic mechanisms of cellular function to
functional organization of neuronal circuits, with particular interest in identifying innovative potential therapies
to cure common eye disorders.
For the past 35 years, we have used the NEI Core Grant to develop and update our shared resource modules,
thus enhancing the capabilities of individual NEI-supported investigators to conduct vision research. The Core
Grant effectively provides equipment and services that are not readily supported by individual research grants,
as well as stimulating a collegial atmosphere conducive to sharing current techniques and ideas. Both are
critical to success of individual investigators and members of their laboratories. Furthermore, the infrastructure
created with support from this grant aids the recruitment of new investigators and facilitates the participation of
clinical ophthalmologists in vision research, including the development of clinician scientists. Altogether, this
supports and facilitates the translation of the discoveries from basic research into new diagnostic and
therapeutic applications directly related to human eye diseases.
We request support for four resource modules: Morphology/Image Processing, Mass Spectrometry/Molecular
Biology, Animal Models and Flow Cytometry. Support of these shared resources is vital to the creation of
synergy that will give impetus to our vision research group in reaching a level of success that is greater than
the sum of the individual investigator's expected achievements."
11134807,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. In some patients, cancer can be cured with
surgery and/or radiation. Many patients will develop advanced disease that must be managed with various
systemic medications and treatments. Unfortunately, the majority of patients in this group will eventually
develop treatment resistant cancer, which is often lethal. Despite its importance, our understanding of how this
resistance develops and evolves is limited. The primary challenge is that the study of treatment resistance
requires obtaining tumor samples before, during, and after it develops. However, obtaining these samples
involves surgical or other invasive procedures that carry some risk of causing a complication which could harm
the patient. Repeatedly obtaining tissue samples for research is not feasible for the majority of patients. We
propose to use a new âliquidâ biopsy technique in which molecular information about the tumor is collected
from serial blood samples, which patients with cancer are frequently providing for a variety of laboratory tests
already. This information can then be used to understand how treatment resistance develops and how it
evolves over time. This will allow us to identify potential strategies to overcome this resistance, as well as
create tests to pick it up early so that treatment can be adjusted before the cancer grows and the patient gets
sicker. This strategy could be used across cancers and treatments and change the paradigm in how we
understand cancer progression as well as change how we monitor and treat patients."

Protein interactions, such as protein-protein, protein-nucleic acid, protein-metabolite, and protein-xenobiotic,
play a critical role in defining the uniqueness and complexity of biological organisms. Understanding where and
when interactions occur is an essential step to functionally characterize the interactome. However, and despite
remarkable advances in computational and proteomic technologies, it remains surprisingly difficult to precisely
pinpoint contact sites cell-wide in a high-throughput manner. Here we present a new approach, termed Fast
Photochemical Oxidation and Capture by Suzuki (FPICS), to map protein interaction sites at high resolution. The
key innovation of our method, which represents an unprecedented technical advance, is the use of a single
halogen atom as both a photoactivatable molecular 'calling card,' to indicate where interactions occur, and a
capture handle, for mass spectrometry-based proteomic detection of each interaction site. With FPICS, halogen
substituents are first transferred, using excimer laser irradiation, from halogenated small molecules (e.g. drugs
or natural products) or halogenated biomolecules (e.g. proteins, lipids, glycans, oligonucleotides, or metabolites)
to interacting proteins. Labeled sites are then captured and identified using bioorthogonal SuzukiâMiyaura cross-
coupling chemoproteomic methodology pioneered by our group. FPICS is groundbreaking because it eliminates
challenges associated with deconvolving the spectra of crosslinked peptides and the frequent and unwanted
fragmentation of large biomolecules. Showcasing the method's wide-ranging applications, here we will apply
FPICS map the protein interaction sites for small molecules, lipids, and nucleic acids, aiming to identify new
functional and therapeutically relevant binding sites proteome-wide. Taken together, this study will yield a
systems-level portrait of the protein interactome, which will lay the foundation for an improved global
understanding of the functional significance of the millions of interactions occurring within every cell. The impact
of our methods will be wide ranging, spanning the fields of chemical biology, analytical chemistry, and systems
biology."
11015946,"Understanding diapause and its ability to suspend and preserve life
Project Summary/ Abstract
âSuspended animationâ may seem like a term only appears in science fiction, but it does exist in several forms
in nature. Many organisms have evolved unique states of dormancy to survive unfavorable conditions.
Frequently, these dormant states demonstrate extraordinary abilities for physiological features not seen during
the active states of life. However, while life comprises both active and dormant states, our research has been
mainly focused on the former, such as development, growth, proliferation, and aging. As a consequence, our
knowledge of how organisms live in dormancy remains limited. Studying dormancy is thus crucial not only for
filling in the gap in knowledge to complete our understanding of life, but also for exploring how to best leverage
this knowledge to improve the quality of life during our active states.
My vision is to accelerate our understanding of dormancy and its functional implication by studying the dormant
state of diapause with a newly established research organism - the naturally short-lived African killifish
(Nothobranchius furzeri). My research subject in diapause and my research system in the African killifish consist
of two novel components for this proposal. Among various forms of dormancy, diapause at the embryonic stage
is especially intriguing. Diapause evolved a rare capability to suspend embryonic development for months or
even years without compromising subsequent development and adulthood physiology. The natural
characteristics of a long diapause coupled with a short lifespan in the African killifish present a uniquely suited
platform to feasibly experiment the functional implication of diapause in vertebrates. Diapause in the African
killifish thus holds the key to a fascinating new field focusing on mechanisms of the suspension and preservation
of life.
In this proposal, I will first focus on the signaling mechanism of diapause, then expand to the interplay between
diapause and development and/or aging. Lastly, I will explore the mechanisms underlying translating diapause
to active life. By leveraging the new technologies of genome editing, single-cell biology, time-lapse microscopy,
coupled with my established resources and tools, I expect to fulfill my research vision by 1) obtaining a thorough
knowledge of the signaling pathways in diapause, and 2) building an experimental platform to elucidate the
functional implication of diapause. Together, the knowledge and the platform complement each other and
compose a powerful system conceptually and experimentally to help us understand diapause and its functional
implication to life."
10883900,"Project Summary. Community-dwelling older adults with ADRD face significant challenges under the
pandemic of COVID-19: they are not only at high risks for COVID-19 infection and mortality, but also at high
risks for the negative consequences of a disruption in usual outpatient care. Older adults with ADRD have high
care needs and rely on timely and regular outpatient care to manage ADRD and other co-exiting conditions.
The consequence of disruption in usual care could be even greater among racial/ethnic minorities with ADRD,
as Blacks and Hispanics generally have a greater disease burden than their white counterparts. To improve
care access, the CMS expanded the coverage of telemedicine in March 2020. Although there has been
significant increase in the telemedicine use since then, it is unknown how the CMS' telemedicine policy
affects care among community-dwelling older adults with ADRD; and how it varies by racial/ethnic
minorities. Indeed, there are concerns that the telemedicine policy may widen racial/ethnic disparities in
health care. Therefore, the main objective of this proposed research is to understand the effect of CMS'
telemedicine policy on health care utilization that are not directly related to COVID among community-dwelling
older adults with ADRD, and its variations by race/ethnicity. This study has 3 Specific Aims: SA1.To examine
racial/ethnic disparities in the utilization of usual outpatient care among community-dwelling older adults with
ADRD, before and after changes in CMS telemedicine policy. We hypothesize that Blacks and Hispanics have
fewer usual outpatient visits than whites after the implementation of telemedicine policy, accounting for prior
health care utilization. We will examine the utilization of usual outpatient care from several dimensions. SA2.To
examine racial/ethnic disparities in the relationship between the telemedicine policy and ambulatory care
sensitive (ACS) hospitalizations, emergency room (ER) visits and observation stays. We hypothesize that
racial/ethnic minorities with ADRD are less likely to benefit from the expansion of telemedicine, in preventing
these ACS acute events. We will also examine how the disparities, if detected, are affected by the access to
telemedicine. Several statistical models (e.g. interrupted time series regression) will be adopted and stratified
analyses (by state and socio-economic status of a community) will be performed for SA 1&2. SA3. To explore
caregivers' perspectives regarding benefits, barriers and challenges of telemedicine use among white, Black
and Hispanic community-dwelling older adults with ADRD. This proposed research is innovative because it is
the first study to examine racial/ethnic disparities in the relationship between the telemedicine policy and health
care utilization among community-dwelling older adults with ADRD, by using a mixed-method approach. This
proposed study is significant because findings will provide information on improving care equity among ADRD
population, both during the pandemic and beyond. Findings will also provide the premise for future studies to
collect data on a larger scale to understand the root cause in health disparities among this population."

11014616,"Project Summary/Abstract
The human genome measures nearly 2 meters in length and must be compacted to fit in the nucleus, which
measures only a few microns in diameter. In addition to compaction, the DNA must be organized to maintain
genome integrity but also remain accessible to the molecular machines that read the genome. How the
genome is organized directly influences which genes are expressed in a particular cell. Decoupling of genome
organization and gene expression has profound consequences for cells, leading to cancer, intellectual
disability, and developmental delay. It is mechanistically unclear how genome organization and the first step of
gene expression, transcription, are physically coupled. Determining how both processes are linked is critical for
understanding how cell type function and specificity are achieved. The first level of eukaryotic genome
compaction and organization is mediated by nucleosomes that are formed by wrapping DNA around histone
proteins. Here I will investigate how DNA sequence and nucleosomes impact gene expression in promoter
proximal regions of human genes. I will mechanistically decipher how the processes of transcription and
genome compaction are intertwined by reconstituting transcription reactions on chromatin in vitro and
observing them using (1) a novel high throughput biochemical assay and (2) time-resolved cryo-electron
microscopy (EM).
 In the first part of this proposal, we will develop a high throughput, single molecule transcription assay
using reconstituted transcription complexes on thousands of DNA sequences. We will assess how DNA
sequence, chromatin state, and transcription factors directly regulate transcriptional activity during early
transcription elongation. This assay will overcome major hurdles in the field by revealing directly how
nucleosomes and protein factors affect transcription behavior on an unprecedented number of DNA sequence
contexts.
 In the second part of this proposal, we will define how chromatin and DNA sequence influence
transcription dynamics by capturing structural snapshots of transcription complexes as they transcribe through
nucleosomes. We will use time-resolved cryo-EM to directly assess which states transcription complexes adopt
during early transcription and identify stable online and labile offline states. Together, this ambitious proposal
will address important questions regarding how nucleosomes and DNA sequence are used to directly influence
transcriptional output. The methods and data acquired in this proposal will help fulfill the long-term vision of my
lab to fully reconstitute mammalian transcription to determine how cell fate is regulated by the coupling of
genome organization and gene expression and how disease mutations can perturb this coupling."

Antibodies are an invaluable tool in the biological sciences and are increasingly used as therapeutics. Over the
past few years a large number of proteomic techniques and large scale studies have been developed to probe
biological and biochemical processes at ever increasing scales. Many of these methods have been limited by
the availability of quality antibody reagents which are still generated one-by-one for each antigen target and the
lack of antibody sequences available. Additionally, large concerns have been raised regarding the quality and
reproducibility of current commercial antibodies. While high-throughput methods have been described capable
of generating antibodies against hundreds of antigens, they are slow, laborious, usually require significant
automation, and are dependent on antigen availability. These issues, combined with the growing need for
many quality antibodies, highlight the urgent need to develop methods capable of proteome-scale antibody
generation.
Here I introduce a radical proposal to create a platform which can generate antibodies against all potential
antigen targets in a target proteome and subsequently carry out proteome-scale tests of cross-reactivity.
This approach will be demonstrated on the human and zebrafish proteomes and consists of three parts.
First, I will develop gene synthesis technologies to create proteome-scale gene libraries consisting of tens of
thousands of antigens. Second, I will generate high diversity libraries of antibodies by repurposing diversity
generating retroelements to carry out targeted mutagenesis in-vivo. This will allow us to bypass the diversity
bottlenecks normally imposed by transformation. Third, I will carry out a large scale library-on-library selection
for antibody-antigen interactions in-vivo using a multiplexed protein fragment complementation assay. The
resulting antibody hits will be rescreened against all antigens to measure their cross-reactivity. This study will
reduce the cost of antibody generation by at least two-orders of magnitude and lead to the rapid creation of
large libraries of high-specificity, sequence-verified antibodies which, given the ubiquitous nature of these
reagents, will have a significant impact on all areas of basic and clinical research. Furthermore, the
technological developments in gene-synthesis and targeted in-vivo mutagenesis outlined will here have broad
applicability in many areas of life sciences research."
11062755,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This essay aims to understand a fundamental property of neurons: their ability to self-recognize and self-
avoid. Self-avoidance is an essential aspect of a neuron's function as it ensures that branches from the same
cell minimize their overlap while maximizing their interactions with branches from other cells. In mammals, at
the core of this process is the generation of sufficient Protocadherin (Pcdh) protein isoform diversity such that
essentially every neuron in the brain is differentially barcoded at its surface and therefore appears different to
other neurons. The generation of Pcdh protein isoform diversity requires complex mechanisms of Pcdh
transcriptional and pre-mRNA splicing such that distinct Pcdh mRNA molecules - bearing a different 5' end
(variable exon) but an identical 3' end (constant exons) - are expressed in individual cells. Understanding how
different Pcdh mRNA molecules are produced represents a long-term mystery in the field of neuroscience.
Answering this fundamental mystery is key in illuminating the process of neuronal self-avoidance and
represents the first essential step toward dissecting how dysregulation of this Pcdh mediated self-avoidance
can lead to severe neurological disorders, such as for instance autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia.
Despite their critical function in the brain, however, limited progress has been made in understanding how
Pcdh mRNAs are transcribed and properly spliced as general models of gene expression regulation have
failed to recapitulate this complex mechanism and as the tools required to study it directly in vivo have lagged
behind. In this proposal, we aim to (i) test a paradigm-shifting hypothesis of Pcdh RNA transcription and
splicing based on alternative trans-splicing of variable and constant exons encoded in tandem on the same
DNA strand - a mechanism that we propose to be regulated by the 3D genome topology of the Pcdh locus -
and (ii) design technological innovations that will allow precise manipulation of the Pcdh gene cluster in vivo
to test our hypothesis directly in neurons. These studies have the potential to illuminate the complex
mechanism of the generation of Pcdh isoform diversity and its role in neuronal self-avoidance and wiring of
healthy and disease brains. The findings from these studies are also poised to open up a new class of
regulatory mechanisms of RNA processing reactions, previously unobserved and uncharacterized in
mammals but that we speculate are utilized by cells to overcome challenging problems of pre-mRNA splicing
associated with complex gene architectures."
11062758,"Project Summary / Abstract
Studies of mechanisms underlying genetic associations with disease have primarily focused on gene
regulatory mechanisms. In contrast, the impact of genetic variation on cellular phenotypes such as
morphology and behavior is poorly understood, despite their importance in disease progression. This poor
understanding is in part because measurement of some cellular phenotypes such as electrophysiological
response patterns require skilled manual labor and is performed cell by cell, and is thus low throughput.
Furthermore, some cellular phenotype assays require live cells, which for cell types such as neurons are
prohibitively challenging to obtain from humans.
The goal of this proposal is to develop deep learning-based frameworks for characterizing how molecular
and cellular phenotypes covary using multimodal datasets, then to predict how these cellular behaviors
mediate the effect of genetic variation on the risk of illnesses such as psychiatric and neurodevelopmental
disorders. We will achieve this overall goal through the development of three frameworks.
Multimodal models linking molecular and cellular phenotypes of cells. By linking gene regulation with
cellular phenotypes such as neuron electrophysiology and morphology, we can then understand how
changes at the molecular level propagate to cellular phenotypes and vice versa. Furthermore, we can use
these models to impute cellular phenotypes when they cannot be measured experimentally.
Identification of cellular phenotypes that mediate genetic risk of mental disorders. We will jointly
model genotype, gene expression, cellular phenotypes and disease risk to generate mechanistic
hypotheses about the mediation of genetic effects on disease risk through cellular phenotypes.
Prediction of cellular phenotypes associated with disease progression. We will develop a prediction
framework for exploring which cellular phenotypes change significantly with disease progression. By
applying our imputation framework developed above, we will predict changes in neuron electrophysiological
response and morphology associated with a range of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders.
We expect completion of this project to yield generalizable computational frameworks for linking genetics
to molecular and cellular phenotypes for diverse cell types and organs."

Â· P3 (Repurposing Ceritinib for OC Therapy): Based on the finding that ceritinib, a kinase inhibitor used for ALK-
 rearranged lung cancer, inhibits mitochondrial respiration, increases reactive oxygen species, and sensitizes
 OC cell lines and PDXs to PARPis independent of ALK status, we will identify pathways that mediate these
 effects and conduct a phase I trial of the ceritinib/olaparib combination.
Â· P4 (Treatment of Advanced OC Using Gene-Edited CAR NK Cells): Building on a prior developmental research
 project, this team located at the University of Minnesota will apply advanced cellular engineering techniques
 to generate activated NK cells with enhanced tumor homing and persistence, then test the safety and efficacy

 Emotion dysregulation is recognized as an integral but insufficiently characterized influence in child
psychopathology. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is emblematic because wide variation in both
cognition and emotion dysregulation exist and are related to impairment. Consensus is emerging that effective
measurement of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive and emotional features of ADHD is
essential for improvement of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, but these efforts are
hampered by within-group heterogeneity. Thus, understanding ADHD mechanistically will require integrating
cognitive and emotional accounts of the disorder. A central puzzle concerns the joint disruption of cognition
and emotionâ frequently observed but poorly explained mechanistically. Two fundamental questions are
addressed here: what mechanisms drive emotion dysregulation in ADHD and how can variation in emotional
features be incorporated into existing nosology? The current proposal builds on prior work that suggests three
temperament-based emotional profiles in children with ADHD: 1) an emotionally-normative, âMildâ profile, 2) a
positive dysregulation, âSurgentâ profile, and 3) a negative dysregulation, âIrritableâ profile. Here, that
descriptive work is carried forward the next step into mechanistic and confirmatory study to advance the
nosology and explanation of ADHD.
 Using a cross sectional, case-control design in 7-10 year-old children, Aim 1 validates and refines the
proposed emotion-based phenotypes by examining their association with in vivo emotional experience using
ecological momentary assessments. This is combined in Aim 2 with an experimental approach to identify
reactive and regulatory mechanisms contributing to individual differences in emotion dysregulation in ADHD.
Here, sequential sampling models are combined with time-locked measures of central and peripheral nervous
system functioning adding novelty. Two types of low-cost, clinically-translatable measures are emphasized:
eye-tracking/pupillometry and electroencephalogram-measured event-related potentials (ERPs). Finally, Aim 3
identifies biobehavioral correlates of emotion-related impairment that are directly relevant to development of
novel treatments. The theoretically-driven, multi-level approach that is used directly addresses RDoC goals
related to multi-method integration and defining mechanisms of complex behavior."
10891765,"Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are one of the characteristic features of Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathology.
They are made primarily of the microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) that is highly phosphorylated,
mislocalized to the cytoplasm from the axon, and aggregated in a complex, dense ï¢âpleated sheet that are
paired helical filaments (PHFs) as determined by cryo-electron microscopy. The distribution of NFTs in the brain
is overwhelmingly consistent across cases of AD: NFT occur initially in the entorhinal cortex, then âspreadâ to
other limbic and association areas over more than a decade; this spread corresponds to the clinical symptoms
of the disease, and correlates with neuronal loss. It was recognized early on that the pattern of spread largely
followed neuroanatomical connections, and it was demonstrated that at least part of the reason for this could be
explained by propagation of misfolded tau across synaptic elements. Recently, it has been discovered that the
LDL receptor-related protein binds tau and participates in tau propagation. The Hyman and Strickland
laboratories have worked together on LRP1 related projects since 1993 and have collaborated to confirm these
observations. Using fractions isolated from AD patient brains, we confirm that LRP1-expressing cells, but not
LRP1-deficient cells, promote tau seeding, demonstrating that LRP1 mediated uptake can lead to escape of tau
proteopathic seeds into the cytoplasm. The mechanism(s) of how this occurs are currently not known and will
be investigated in Aims 1 and 3 of this grant. We also identified some residual uptake that we now show to be
due, in part, to SORL1, another apoE receptor that is implicated in trafficking, and â importantly- is also clearly
implicated in the genetics of AD. The role of SORL1 in tau uptake and processing will be examined in Aims 2
and 3). These data and new questions lead us to propose a multi-PI application to explore the following aims:
(1) Identify mechanisms by which LRP1 promotes proteopathic seeding of tau; (2) Define the contribution of
SORL1 and SORL1 mutants to tau proteopathic seeding; (3) Identify mechanisms responsible for the
endolysosomal escape and tau seeding"

Gene regulation is fundamental for every aspect of human function and errors in this process are
key drivers for many diseases, including cancer. Proper gene expression requires a large number
of proteins to assemble and function in a highly coordinated manner, but how this is achieved is
still not understood. Recent studies revealed that some transcriptional regulators form dynamic
high local concentration assemblies termed transcriptional condensates or hubs. These
condensates are driven by weak multivalent interactions, which have biophysical properties and
regulatory mechanisms distinct from the long-studied âlock and keyâ-type of high-affinity
interactions. As such, the discovery of transcriptional condensates offers a new molecular
principle to explain how transcription is organized. However, it remains unclear how exactly
transcriptional condensates from, how they are regulated and dysregulated, and how they impact
gene control during development and in diseases. This is largely due to the lack of experimental
strategies to precisely control condensate formation and its properties for functional and
mechanistic interrogations. This project uniquely addresses these major gaps by leveraging
naturally occurring disease mutations. We discovered a series of oncogenic mutations in a
chromatin regulator that promote aberrant formation of transcriptional condensates. These
âacquiredâ condensates strongly correlated with oncogenic gene activation and tumorigenesis,
providing one of the first examples linking aberrant condensate formation to human disease.
Using these mutations as the stepping-stone, this project aims to develop a more in-depth and
broad understanding of transcriptional condensates and establish their dysregulation as a new
pathognenic mechanism. Specifically, we will ask three major questions: (1) How do
transcriptional condensates form at the molecule level? (2) What are the regulatory functions
enabled by transcriptional condensates? (3) Can transcriptional condensates be therapeutically
targeted? We will integrate cutting-edge approaches in structural biology, single-molecule
imaging, gene regulation, epigenetics, cancer biology, and high-throughput drug discovery to
address these questions. Successful completion of this project would offer definitive evidence and
mechanistic insights needed to establish a new model of gene control. It also has the potential to
transform how we think about and target gene dysregulation in diseases. The ideal experimental
system we discovered and extensive expertise of my lab put us in a unique position to embark on
this highly ambitious but urgently needed research program."

Alzheimerâs disease (AD) is the most prevalent age-related neurodegenerative disease in the
United States. More than 90% of cases are idiopathic and there is growing consensus that gene
x environment interactions influence the age of onset and progression of this devastating disease.
Epidemiological studies have reported a positive correlation between exposure to traffic-related
air pollution (TRAP) and the occurrence of the hallmark clinical characteristics of AD. Preclinical
studies support a causal relationship between TRAP and increased AD risk, but many of these
studies used concentrated ambient particles or diesel exhaust that do not recapitulate the
complexity of current real-world TRAP exposures. We have designed a unique exposure model
in which TgF344-AD rats expressing human AD susceptibility genes are exposed in real-time to
TRAP collected from a major freeway tunnel system, which preserves the gaseous and particulate
components of real-world TRAP and captures daily fluctuations in pollutant levels. We will
leverage this model to test our central hypothesis that TRAP decreases the time to onset and/or
increases severity of AD-like phenotypes via microglial cell activation secondary to lung
inflammation by addressing the following specific aims: (1) Determine which vehicle emission
component(s) cause neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the TgF344-AD rat; and (2)
Investigate the role of the lung-brain axis in mediating TRAP effects on AD phenotypes in the
genetically susceptible TgF344-AD rat. In Aim 1, male and female TgF344-AD rats will be
transported to the tunnel vivarium at 1 month of age and then exposed to gases, particulate matter
(PM), or both from light duty only vs. light and heavy-duty vehicle exhaust. Outcomes including
blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity, particulate matter in the brain, microglial and astroglial
activation, AD-relevant pathology, lung pathology, and spatiotemporal profiles of soluble
inflammatory mediators and immune cells in the lung, blood, and brain, will be assessed at 4, 9,
12, and 15 months of age. In Aim 2, we will assess the contributions of pulmonary inflammation
and microglial activation to TRAP effects on AD by quantifying AD phenotypes in TRAP-exposed
male and female TGF344-AD rats fed chow supplemented with pirfenidone or Senicapoc, which
block pulmonary fibrosis via inhibition of TGF-Î² signaling or inhibition of KCa3.1 ion channels,
respectively. Outcomes, which include cognitive behavior plus the endpoints measured in Aim 1,
will be assessed at 12 and 15 months of age. Our broad long-term objectives are to inform
regulatory and health interventions aimed at reducing AD risk for individuals living, working, or
attending school near busy roadways."

Epigenetics refers to stable gene expression patterns mediated by DNA methylation and/or chromatin
remodeling and is involved in cellular identity and repression of spurious transcription, including from repetitive
elements. Over the past 20 years, in work led in part by investigators in this application, epigenetic changes were
recognized as important drivers of cancer formation, progression and resistance to therapy. This recognition,
along with the reversible nature of the biochemical modifications required for epigenetics led to the field of
Epigenetic Therapy, which aims to reprogram gene expression to achieve a therapeutic effect. This field, which
started with DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors, has grown to a dozen epigenetic targets and over 30
drugs in clinical trials. Four targets have made it to US-FDA approval (DNMTs, Histone Deacetylases (HDACs),
EZH2 and Isocitrate Dehydrogenases) and tens of thousands of cancer patients benefit from this every year.
With the identification of new targets and the recognition that epigenetics is involved in sensitivity and resistance
to chemotherapy and immunotherapy, the clinical potential of epigenetic therapy has begun to be explored in
earnest. There remain fundamental challenges, from the lack of robust biomarkers of activity, to the emergence
of resistance, and to the unexplained divide in responses between hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.
This SPORE application will address all of these challenges. The SPORE team consists of investigators who are
pioneers in the fields of cancer epigenetics and epigenetic therapy and explores new epigenetic targets and
combination strategies along with a robust biomarker analysis pipeline to identify patients likely to respond and
pharmacodynamic markers of response. The team leverages a strong clinical and translational pipeline built
through the Van Andel Institute Stand Up To Cancer Epigenetics Dream Team, which has conducted 14
epigenetic therapy clinical trials in the past few years, and is fully committed to the clinical trials proposed in this
application. This Epigenetic Therapy SPORE encompasses four major themes: (i) Develop and test drugs
against new epigenetic targets (Projects 1, 2), (ii) Mechanistic and translational studies of immunosensitization
by epigenetic therapy (projects 1-3), (iii) Studies of drug combinations that enhance the efficacy of known
epigenetic drugs (projects 1-3); and (iv) Biomarker studies to define sensitivity and resistance to epigenetic
therapy in the clinic (all Projects). These themes will be addressed through 3 projects: (i) Cyclin Dependent
Kinases as Epigenetic Therapy Targets; (ii) Epigenetic synergy between DNMT and EZH1/2 inhibitors; (iii)
Linking epigenetic-therapy induction of inflammasome signaling to generation of a BRCAness phenotype. These
projects will be supported by three cores (administrative, pathology, genomics) and a key goal will also be to
mentor the next generation of Epigenetic Therapy investigators and support cutting-edge science through the
Career Enhancement and Developmental Research Programs."
11009679,"Project Summary/Abstract
 In preliminary studies, my colleagues and I used a single cell RNA sequencing to profile gene expression
within individual cells of pediatric brain tumors. My single cell profiles provided the first direct evidence of a
concept long suspected but never directly tested â namely that pediatric brain cancers arise from relatively
uncommitted neural progenitors that become developmentally stalled in a replication-competent state. That
being said, my preliminary observations have a central limitation â namely that scRNAseq destroys information
about spatial relationships: who is next to whom within the tumor and within the brain?
 Why should we care about nearest neighbor relationships between tumor cells and the cellular
components of normal brain? The answer is embedded within an emerging body of data highlighting functional
interactions between tumor and tumor microenvironment. Within brain tumors, cell division, fate choice decisions,
development and survival are regulated by short range interactions between presenter and receiver cell types.
All of these informative cell:cell interactions are erased by conventional genomic profiling methods including
scRNAseq.
 I propose here that combinatorial transcriptional codes identified by scRNAseq can localize cancer stem
cells and cancer cell subtypes in 3D-space within the brain where conventional immunochemical markers fail.
To test this proposal, I will (i) generate combinatorial transcriptional codes unique to the various cancer cells and
tumor-associated normal cells from my existing single cell dataset; (ii) design specific primers for these
combinatorial identifiers and; (iii) visualize cell:cell contacts by performing in situ sequencing on patient-derived
tumor samples and on normal brain tissue samples.
 I will focus on pediatric gliomas, the most common tumor type of childhood. My study plan has two
question-oriented, hypothesis-driven aims and a third goal-oriented aim (with a useful deliverable). Aim one
asks why some cells within high grade gliomas exit the replication competent state to differentiate while others
remain replication competent. Is the developmental cue intrinsic (i.e. a developmental âclockâ) or extrinsic (e.g.
a short range ligand:receptor interaction)? Aim two asks why some gliomas invade and others do not. I will use
methodology summarized above to test the hypothesis that malignant or benign phenotypes are an outcome of
differential âaddictionsâ to local mitogenic signals from normal neural cell types. Aim three is to expand my data
sets on glioma into a tumor-wide single cell atlas of normal cell contacts with most major forms of pediatric brain
cancer."
11062753,"Project Summary: Shifting Suicide Prevention Paradigms: Looking Beyond Clinical Settings
Every 10 minutes one person dies by suicide in the US, a result of a public health epidemic that has increased
over the last 15 years and incurred over $70 billion in medical costs and lost productivity. A common
lamentation in the wake of suicide is, âIf we had only known how bad things were.â A crucial scientific gap in
suicide prevention stems from the majority of suicide research relying on individual psychopathology, largely
overlooking meaningful constellations of risk in a broader context of social environmental life disruptions that
commonly precede suicide. Job loss, financial strain, divorce, legal problems, housing instability â these life
disruptions can be semaphores of despair that are misinterpreted as coincidental rather than causal; thus
overlooked as points for timely detection and intervention. I propose a paradigm shift in suicide research by
prioritizing social determinants to develop public health research and prevention through broad, but
strategic, partnerships with industries outside of mental health and health care, including the specific
industries of family law, mortgage foreclosure, and unemployment services. This proposal uses a two-
pronged approach that ventures beyond traditional funding mechanisms by challenging what we typically
consider to be âhealthâ vs. ânon-healthâ-related suicide prevention research and intervention. First, by taking
the tested methodology of psychological autopsy and reinventing it as a social autopsy, we will dive deeply
both into the nature of life disruptions that often precede suicide and the contacts with non-medical services
that a suicide decedent may have made prior to their death. Second, by surveying and interviewing employees
of industries that commonly deal with life disruptions (i.e., divorce, mortgage foreclosure, and job loss), we will
explore their experiences with suicidal clients, such as occupational wisdom and intuition around warning signs
among clients, training around suicide prevention, knowledge about suicide, and approaches they may have
used when working with clients in distress. Seeking unconventional upstream strategies to identify and reach
people at risk for suicide is all the more urgent against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, which created
historic job loss, relationship strain, and increased potential of mortgage foreclosures. As a researcher trained
in public health sciences, I investigate the social production of health problems, exemplified in my focus of how
social determinants contribute to poor mental health, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt. My perspective,
coupled with extensive experience in survey data research and efforts in training medicolegal death
investigators, uniquely qualify me to successfully implement these novel approaches to change suicide risk
detection and prevention. True integration of social determinants into suicide prevention research requires
rethinking the problem of suicide as solely a clinical mental health problem requiring clinical solutions, to
suicide as a problem at a social and clinical nexus, thus necessitating both social and clinical solutions."
10883899,"PROJECT SUMMARY
APOE4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic AD with Ab-dependent and Ab-independent effects on
disease pathogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenic nature of APOE4 are not
fully elucidated. In previous funding period, we have demonstrated that APOE4-induced phosphoinositol
biphosphate (PIP2) dyshomeostasis through the increased expression of a PIP2-degrading enzyme, synaptojanin
1 (synj1). In parallel, a non-biased multiscale network analysis of human dataset from the AMP-AD consortium
identifies synj1 as a key driver in both male and female AD subnetworks. Synj1 reduction has been found to
provide several beneficial effects such as rescuing APOE4-associated cognitive impairments and lysosomal
defects. Notably, we discovered that APOE4+ microglia have higher synj1 expression at baseline, and that
APOE4+ microglia manifests with impaired phagocytic activities and lysosomal defects when compared to
APOE3+ microglia which can be rescued by synj1 haploinsufficiency. A pilot study indicates that lowering synj1
expression in E4FAD mice protects against cuprizone-induced chronic neuro-inflammation and cognitive/motor
deficits in vivo. We postulate that the APOE-synj1-PIP2 signal pathway plays a functional role in regulating
microglial function, and that dysregulated microglial synj1-PIP2 homeostasis induced by APOE4 may lead to
dysregulated immune function and excessive synaptic elimination, promoting APOE4-associated
neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction. Therefore, we will characterize the regulation of microglial function
by the APOE-synj1-PIP2 signaling pathway during aging and AD pathogenesis in this renewal application. We
propose to 1) investigate microglial synj1 function in modulating APOE4-regulated neuroinflammation in AD in
vivo (Aim 1) using cuprizone-induced inflammation in male and female EFAD mouse models (human ApoE4
knock-in at 5xFAD background); 2) to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which the APOE-synj1-PIP2
signaling pathway regulates microglial function (Aim 2) using mouse microglia from EFAD mice (synj1+/+ and
synj1+/-), mouse microglia from TREM2-/- or APOE-/- mice, and human iPSC-derived microglia from APOE3+/+
and APOE4+/+ normal and AD subjects; 3) to investigate temporal and spatial relationship between dysregulated
microglial function and excessive neurite and synaptic elimination using ex vivo 3-D co-culture of iPSC-derived
brain cells; 4) to perform high resolution multiscale network modeling using scRNA-seq dataset from mouse
brains and RNA-seq dataset from human iPSC-derived microglia and co-culture to identify microglia-specific
molecular signatures driven by APOE-synj1-PIP2 signaling; and 5) to validate identified molecular signature in
post-mortem human brain samples (Aim 3). The goals of this application aim to elucidate novel pathways and
molecular signatures underlying APOE4-induced microglial dysfunction. These studies will facilitate identification
and development of a more personalized targeted therapy to APOE-regulated neuroinflammation in AD."

Our overarching vision of the Boston Childrenâs Hospital and Harvard Medical School Intellectual and
Developmental Disorders Research Center (IDDRC) is to improve the lives of individuals with IDD with timely
and efficient translation of scientific research through collaboration among our institutionsâ exceptional
investigators and clinicians in partnership with the external IDD community. To achieve our broad vision, we
organize the Centerâs research around four clearly defined themes: 1) Discovery of genetic and non-genetic
causes of IDD; 2) Determination of the cellular bases of IDDs using advanced imaging and analysis tools; 3)
Identification of translational phenotypes in animal models of IDD to validate therapeutics; 4) Accelerated
translation of research discoveries into new prevention and treatment strategies for IDDs. The Center currently
supports 106 research projects and 68 investigators through the Administrative Core and the four scientific
Cores. The Administrative Core is the hub of the Center as it provides both scientific and administrative
leadership which promotes synergistic, interdisciplinary interactions that address IDD-related issues at multiple
levels, trains the next generation of young investigators and facilitates outreach and dissemination of IDD
research to diverse audiences. The Genetic Analysis and Editing Core (GAEC) provides access to the latest
technological advances both in genetic analysis and in gene editing. The Cellular Imaging Core (CIC)
facilitates the study of cellular and circuit biology through state-of-the-art imaging and image analysis services
which enable visualization of fixed tissue, in vitro organ explants and in vivo awake behaving model organisms.
The Animal Behavior and Physiology (AB&P) Core provides investigators with access to a wide range of
validated technologies and scientific expertise for in vivo rodent behavioral, biochemical and physiological
measures in a well-controlled and rigorous preclinical setting. Finally, the Clinical Translational Core (CTC)
provides full access for IDDRC PIs to all services required for translation of research discoveries into clinical
innovation; this ranges from biosample collection and storage, generation of patient-derived stem cell models
of diseases, drug screening platforms on the preclinical side to neurobehavioral and electrophysiological
assessment of IDD patients of different age groups as well as statistical and regulatory support of clinical trials.
The Cores all interact through shared projects, providing complementary expertise and tools to address unique
aspects of central scientific questions, and the Core directors meet to exchange ideas and optimize resource
utilization in the monthly Executive Committee meetings. This integrated approach aims to enhance the
translational potential of basic research in IDD by putting patients at the center of the drug discovery cycle
starting with genetic and molecular screens through clinical trials. The Center engages frequently with patient-

Metastatic breast cancer and relapse following therapy are dependent on (1) development of intrinsic resistance
to targeted and endocrine therapies, and (2) resistance to recognition and destruction of cancer cells by the
immune system. The Stanford Breast Metastasis Center (SBMC) is focused on (1) quantifying the timing of
metastatic dissemination in breast cancer (2) functionally delineating the contribution of cellular and
microenvironmental crosstalk on metastatic proclivity, and (3) characterizing the mechanisms of responses by
metastatic cells to therapies.
 In order to achieve these goals, mechanistic computational models that capture dynamic and
emergent tumor cell intrinsic and extrinsic properties are needed as are clinically annotated longitudinal
tissue cohorts and experimental models that capture disease heterogeneity. The SBMC addresses each of these
outstanding challenges. First, we have established an unparalleled collection of clinically annotated breast
cancer cohorts sampled through treatment and metastasis, including both prospective and retrospective
longitudinal cohorts, with multiple metastatic sites. We leverage a living biobank of breast cancer patient-
derived organoids (PDOs) from primary tumors and metastases that recapitulate the heterogeneity of
disease, high-risk of relapse subgroups and tumor-immune interactions and greatly facilitating the proposed
functional studies. We characterize these vast tissue resources and model systems using state-of-the-art
molecular profiling technologies to probe tumor tissue in situ at single cell and subcellular resolution. Specifically,
with Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by Time of Flight (MIBI-TOF) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization

and stromal cell populations and perform co-registered analysis of the glycome. We integrate these data within
the genomic landscape of metastatic disease and analyze these data within robust machine learning and
computational frameworks to uncover disease dynamics and features associated with clinical outcomes.
Lastly, we conduct genome-scale CRISPR screens in 3D breast cancer models to systematically define
oncogenic dependencies, therapeutic vulnerabilities and macrophage-tumor cell interactions.

10879738,"PROJECT SUMMARY
For hosts chronically infected with a pathogen, survival is ultimately determined by a carefully balanced host
response that must include both resistance and disease tolerance mechanisms. âResistanceâ involves
antimicrobial pathways that directly control bacterial burden, while disease âtoleranceâ is comprised of
mechanisms to withstand the cumulative damage of tissue damage that chronic infection entails. In the context
of tuberculosis (TB), resistance pathways eventually break down, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is
able to persist in tissues long-term. At that point, disease tolerance is vital for regulating the immune response
to prevent overt damage and ensure ultimate survival of the host. With the failure of current therapies that
focus on directly targeting microbial pathways, this proposal instead focuses on identifying the mediators of
host tolerance that may be leveraged to design new host-directed strategies. From preliminary studies through
the Collaborative Cross (CC) panel, unlike standard inbred mouse strains, I found that the CC panel models
the broad phenotypic spectrum of TB disease states observed in human cohorts. I identified CC genotypes that
control a spectrum of phenotypes ranging from CC mice that are resistant and able to control bacterial burden,
to CC mice that are highly susceptible and succumb to disease within a month of infection. While I found many
disease traits were generally correlated, I also found CC strains harboring qualitatively distinct disease states,
including several âoutlierâ genotypes where typical disease metrics were broken. For example, bacterial burden
and weight loss are correlated in the standard C57BL/6J model of infection, yet among CC strains harboring
107 CFU in their lungs, I identified genotypes with a wide variation in weight loss and survival. Several
genotypes showed limited pathology and could tolerate disease at high burden, while other CC genotypes
exhibited weight loss and succumbed to disease at the same CFU. These data suggest that distinct genetic
mechanisms underlie disease tolerance. In the New Innovator Award, this project will leverage these CC
âoutlierâ strains as new models of disease tolerance to define the immunological, bacterial and host genetic
mechanisms underpinning this essential and understudied component of protective immunity to pathogens.
Overall, this work will provide new insights into disease tolerance that are relevant to genetically diverse hosts.
Understanding the immunological and genetic mediators of disease tolerance will allow the rational design of
novel host-directed strategies that may be applied to tuberculosis and other chronic infections."
11134805,"Title: Determining Age-Dependent Metabolic Changes in Tumors and Their Microenvironment
Project science areas: 6 MCB, 8 HIB
Project Summary/Abstract:
 Aging is one of the primary risk factors for cancer and deregulated metabolism is a unifying hallmark for
both aging and cancer. Yet, we do not fully understand how ageassociated metabolic changes contribute to
cancer initiation and progression. Although many animal models are created to fatefully recapitulate the
oncogenic events that lead to cellular transformation and cancer progression, most are carried out in young
animals that likely have metabolically different tumor microenvironments and robust immune systems. To this
date, few studies have systematically examined how age-dependent alterations of cellular and organismal
metabolism impact tumor growth and metastasis. We hypothesize that age-associated metabolic dysregulation
will significantly alter cellular metabolism both within tumor cells, as well as in cells within the tumor
microenvironment, which may influence cancer progression and response to therapies. We propose a
multipronged, single cell approach to characterize and resolve metabolic changes over time, both within the
tumor and its microenvironment. Finally, we will assess the impact of environmental factors, such as dietary
nutrients and microbiome derived metabolites, on cancer initiation and progression. Collectively, we think our
findings will be transformative and will answer key questions of how aging rewires cellular metabolism and how
it affects tumor growth and metastasis. We hope to elucidate important questions about cellular plasticity,
metabolic heterogeneity and identify metabolic liabilities that can be accentuated by limiting specific nutrients or
metabolites in new combinatorial therapies."
11014641,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Each day billions of cells die and are cleared rapidly with minimal immunological consequence. This process,
clearance of apoptotic cells or efferocytosis, is carried out by phagocytes such as macrophages which are
numerically fewer in tissues and are often responsible for clearing multiple dead cells and debris in quick
succession. Efferocytosis is thought to be important for preventing autoimmunity and inflammatory disease.
However, patients suffering from autoimmunity or inflammatory disease rarely present with symptoms expected
from a defect in clearance of apoptotic cells, such as excessive accumulation of apoptotic or necrotic cells. On
one hand, you have a process that is occurring in every tissue and organ, yet on the other hand, it remains
unclear how this process contributes to or prevents autoimmunity and inflammatory disease. We present a new
model that suggests autoimmunity and inflammatory disease arise because of disruptions in how macrophages
manage apoptotic cell digestion instead of whether or not macrophages engulf at all. This model suggests that
efferocytosis is a dangerous process because the content of engulfed apoptotic cells, such as lipids, amino acids,
and nucleic acids, can trigger potentially catastrophic inflammatory responses by macrophages. To prevent this,
we hypothesize that macrophages use mechanisms to rapidly detect and respond to the engulfed material,
termed rapid response circuits (RRCs). This proposal combines novel experimentation with -omics approaches
and informatics to identify and assemble putative efferocytosis RRCs, then uses innovative tools and methods
to mechanistically study identified efferocytosis RRCs. Using this approach, we will first examine the common
efferocytosis RRCs used by macrophages. Then, we will explore unique efferocytosis RRCs used by tissue-
resident macrophages who are exposed to dying cells and debris specific to the tissue of residence. Collectively,
this work on RRCs will contribute to a new framework for understanding how failure to appropriately digest
apoptotic cells contributes to autoimmunity and inflammatory disease, and possibly reveal novel diagnostics and
therapeutics."
11134802,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Living cells require a constant supply of nutrients that provide energy and building blocks to support
their vital activities and growth. Fluctuations in nutrient availability are inevitable. Thus, to survive, cells need to
adapt to these changes by rewiring their metabolism. Studying this metabolic adaptation in lower organisms
has revolutionized our understanding of biological systems. For example, the discovery of how prokaryotes
respond to changes in the accessibility to lactose and glucose as a carbon source led to the concept of gene
regulation after the identification of the lac operon.
 In eukaryotes the evolution of subcellular organelles provided an optimal environment for biochemical
reactions to proceed. Moreover, this system allowed the eukaryotic cell to evolve additional strategies to
acquire nutrients besides passive diffusion or transport across the cell membrane. Through the endo-
lysosomal compartment, cells can scavenge nutrients from extracellular macromolecules, which provides them
with metabolic flexibility to survive various states of nutrient availability by balancing the composition of their
microenvironment with their nutrient demands.
 Nutrient acquisition strategies are fully exploited by malignant cells to survive the harsh tumor
microenvironment. Pancreatic cancer, a lethal malignancy, is a paradigm of metabolic adaptation. Hypo-
vascularization of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) limits the delivery of free nutrients and oxygen to
cancer cells. To overcome nutrient scarcity, cancer and stromal cells rely on scavenging nutrients from intra-
and extracellular macromolecules via autophagy and macropinocytosis, respectively. Both pathways converge
on the lysosome, a cellular organelle that degrades macromolecules to recycle their nutrient content.
 Despite their essential role in cancer, studying lysosomes in highly heterogenous tumors in vivo is
challenging because of the lack of tools that allow the functional profiling of lysosomal content during
tumorigenesis at a cell-type-specific resolution. In this proposal, I will describe our novel approach to develop
an innovative technology that allows the rapid capturing of lysosomes from specific cell types in the tumor to
profile their metabolite, lipid and protein contents to understand how lysosomes in malignant and stromal cells
mediate metabolic adaptation. We will also design a modular mouse model system that will allow the selective
interrogation of the lysosomal response to major metabolic stressors that exist in the tumor microenvironment.
 Our innovative approaches combined with functional characterization of the lysosomal components
using genetic tools will result in an unprecedent subcellular and cell-type-specific understanding of tumor
metabolism. We believe that our work has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of metabolic
adaptation in mammalian systems, and to identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited as novel therapeutic
targets in pancreatic cancer."
10890250,"Recent AD GWAS studies have uncovered a number of risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within
genes predominantly expressed or upregulated in microglia in association with pathology suggesting that altered
microglia function plays a critical role in disease etiology. Each of these polymorphisms can either confer
increased or decreased risk and it will be important to understand how inheritance of each of these
polymorphisms impact microglia function to modify disease risk. One identified AD GWAS risk SNP rs3865444
is near the CD33 gene, confers protection from AD, and is found in linkage disequilibrium with rs12459419 SNP,
which leads to skipping of exon 2 that encodes the sialic acid-binding domain. CD33 is a member of the Sialic
acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglecs) family of receptors in which sialic acid binding transmit signals
from the extracellular microglial environment leading to downstream microglia signaling and a subsequent
microglia cellular response/change. Because CD33 lacks a true murine ortholog, the study of CD33 requires
human cells. The ability to generate microglia-like cells (iMGLs) from iPSC and development of microglia
functional assays in my lab will enable investigation of the role of exon 2 skipping on microglia function. Patient
and CD33 isogenic induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) will be used to derive iMGLs to interrogate microglia
function in the context of differing CD33 genotype. Using liposomal nanoparticles that bring together ligands of
two receptors, we will examine the role of CD33 as a co-receptor in modulating Dap12 and FcRg signaling. In
addition, we will investigate the functional significance of an interferon microglia signature uncovered by whole
transcriptome analysis of patient-derived microglia-like cells. Lastly, a novel AD mouse model facilitating
xenotransplantation will be employed to examine the CD33-D2 interferon signature in vivo and whether it
improves behavior, reduces AD pathology, and therefore can be targeted as a novel AD therapeutic."
10840771,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In spite of progress in treatment and promising new drugs multiple sclerosis (MS) continues to be a chronic
progressive disease with a high impact on the quality of life of those affected, their families, and society. Further,
MS incidence is increasing among US Blacks and among women of all races in several regions in the world.
These rapid increases cannot be explained by genetic factors, and strongly suggest that environmental factors,
possibly modifiable, are contributing to determine MS risk. Vitamin D is likely to be one of these factors, but
questions remain on the role of vitamin D in MS particularly among blacks. Ten years ago, we published a
landmark paper reporting that young healthy non-Hispanic white adults with higher serum levels of 25-
hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) had a 62% lower risk of developing MS than those with lower levels. This finding,
which has been later confirmed in multiple studies, has major public health implications because it supports the
notion that the ongoing increase in MS incidence could be halted or reversed by increasing vitamin D levels. An
important limitation, however, is that this inverse association between vitamin D and MS risk cannot be
generalized to blacks. Further, it remains unclear whether vitamin D levels important only during childhood and
adolescence or also during adult life, and whether there are differences between men and women in the vitamin
D levels needed to prevent MS. Answering these questions is critical to be able to translate the research findings
into sound and effective public health interventions. The proposed study relies on the unique data and blood
samples collected from over 10 million individuals during their active duty within the US military and over 60
million serum samples stored in the Department of Defense Serum Repository. The availability of multiple blood
samples from each individual prior to MS onset allows an accurate estimate of long term average 25(OH)D
levels, and the diverse composition of the study population will allow for the first time to obtain accurate estimates
of the relation between vitamin D and MS risk among US blacks, to determine whether the relation between
25(OH)D and MS risk is modified by age or gender, and to explore gene-environment interactions that have
potentially important public health implications."
10879805,"Abstract:
The discovery of antibiotics in the early 20th century has transformed modern medicine; yet decades of use,
overuse, and misuse have culminated in the rapid rise in pathogens that are refractory to our existing drugs.
Antibiotic resistance is not the only reason for treatment failure. Within antibiotic-sensitive cultures,
subpopulations of bacteria can transiently reprogram their phenotype, which enable them to survive lethal
antibiotic doses. These bacterial persisters are thought to underlie recurrent and chronic infections, and they
can fuel the development of resistance. Mounting evidence shows that environmental factors modulate
phenotypic changes that lead to antibiotic persistence before, during, and after treatment. As such, achieving a
deeper understanding of the interplay between environmental cues, bacterial phenotypic responses, and
antibiotic susceptibility will improve our ability to devise more effective treatment regimens.
When pathogens colonize and infect different parts of the host, they are often exposed to other pathogens and
constituents of the host microbiome. The extent to which microbial interactions modulate a pathogen's
phenotype and antibiotic persistence remains largely unexplored. Our overarching objective for this project is
to systematically investigate the impact of microbiome constituents on Staphylococcus aureus's phenotypic
response and persistence to antibiotics. To achieve this goal, we will develop a co-culturing phenotypic screen
to identify bacterial strains and communities that impact S. aureus antibiotic persistence toward distinct
classes of antibiotics. Using a combination of transcriptomics, metabolomics, and single-cell approaches, we
will determine how these microbial interactions modulate S. aureus phenotypes (on the population- and single-
cell level) before, during, and after antibiotic treatment. We will also use analytical techniques to identify
molecular determinants that mediate microbial interactions responsible for the strongest effect on S. aureus
persistence. We envision that the outcome of this project will expand our knowledge of the persister
phenotype, contribute to the discovery of novel antimicrobial adjuvants, and guide the development of
innovative treatment strategies to tackle chronic infections."
11014643,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cellular function is maintained by the intricate regulation and coordination of highly dynamic organelles, which
themselves contain multiple components and protein assemblies that constantly function together to promote
cellular homeostasis. However, the field of cell biology has thus far largely focused on organelle dynamics at
the whole-organelle level, or the crosstalk between organelles at inter-organelle membrane contact sites. In
contrast, the molecular events occurring inside organelles at the intra-organelle level, such as within the
mitochondria matrix, and the timing, distribution and regulation of these events has remained vastly
unexplored, largely due to the previous lack of high-speed super-resolution microscopy to probe these
questions at the nanoscale level. Importantly, filling in these missing pieces will be essential for the field of cell
biology by dynamically mapping the cellular architecture of a living cell in real-time and advancing our
knowledge of cellular homeostasis at the intra-organelle level. Mitochondria are highly critical organelles for
regulating cellular function, and contain their own mtDNA which is transcribed into mtRNA within the
mitochondrial matrix, as well as mitochondrial chaperones which help to promote efficient folding of the
mitochondrial proteome. However, how these events are distributed inside the mitochondria and the regulation
of their dynamics is still not well understood. Moreover, how the timing of these events are mechanistically
regulated to maintain proper mitochondrial function and overall cellular homeostasis remains unclear. Using
advanced high-speed super-resolution microscopy and single molecule tracking studies inside organelles, this
proposal seeks to investigate how the dynamics of intra-organelle components and individual protein
complexes are regulated within organelles such as the mitochondria. In addition, as defects in mtDNA and
mitochondrial chaperones have been linked to multiple human diseases which involve neurodegeneration,
these studies will also shed light on how intra-organelle events are preferentially regulated in neurons to
regulate neuronal homeostasis in distinct neuronal compartments and within different neuronal populations.
Finally, this work will probe the role of intra-organelle events in driving disease pathogenesis using patient-
derived neurons to provide new insights into how mtDNA and mitochondrial chaperone mutations contribute to
the etiology of neurological disorders, and potentially identify new therapeutic angles for targeting
neurodegeneration. Together, these studies will help to answer essential questions of how key components
and protein assemblies inside the mitochondria are spatially and temporally organized to dynamically regulate
cellular and neuronal homeostasis. Ultimately, this work will provide a novel platform for studying the intra-
organelle events occurring within other types of organelles, with the end goal of creating a dynamic cellular
architecture map of the entire living cell and expanding our fundamental understanding of the real-time
molecular events at nanoscale levels underlying cell biology and cellular neuroscience."
11086429,"ABSTRACT: OVERALL COMPONENT Exposure to air pollution from automobile exhaust and forest fires is a
significant, rapidly growing global public health burden that contributes to cardiopulmonary pathogenesis.
Produced by epithelial and inflammatory cells, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1Î²) is key to this inflammatory response
within blood, lung, cardiac, and vascular tissues, and primarily associated with acute and chronic inflammation
upon exposure to pollutants. Accordingly, understanding the mechanisms of the IL-1Î² and other pathways will
significantly benefit cardiopulmonary health since therapies are available to block this pathway and since
knowledge of direct mechanisms of how air pollution leads to cardiopulmonary diseases is needed to shape
policy in public health. Our central objective is to test distinct but intertwined mechanistic aspects of IL-1Î² and
other pathway regulation in inflammation-associated cardiopulmonary pathology linked to air pollution. We will
test the hypothesis that the immunopathology of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases are linked to IL-1Î²
and/or other pathways, as we have preliminary data demonstrating activation of IL-1Î² and inflammasome, and
other pathways in air pollution exposure, particularly PM2.5. We understand there are other pathways other than
IL-1Î² involved and to this end, we have proposed unbiased, agnostic experiments in all projects and cores,
especially the systems biology approach of project 2. Furthermore, our data show the link of immune pathways
to clinical outcomes, such as increase systolic blood pressure, in young children and adolescents exposed to air
pollution. We have created synergy and dependency of all the projects and cores since we use all the same
samples from the same cohorts, we share data to be able to create composite biological biomarkers to link
pathology to disease (i.e. asthma or increased blood pressure). As an example of our innovation together, we
have proposed using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in both lung and heart models (Projects 1 and 3)
to screen and identify agents that block IL-1Î² and other pathway effects. Our aims are: 1. Describe the
mechanisms underlying heart, lung, and immune diseases associated with air pollution (PM2.5) exposure.
We will identify and characterize biomarkers of acute and chronic environmental exposure to air pollution that
predict cardiopulmonary diseases. 2. Ensure the efforts of the three scientific projects and project cores
will be synergistic, coordinated, and integrated. We describe specifically how the three projects and cores
are synergistic and how we will integrate our study findings with other efforts to investigate IL-1Î² and other
pathways. 3: Provide a highly interactive, collaborative, and multi-disciplinary team of investigators and
resources to support our goals. We describe our multi-disciplinary facilities and investigators that will
contribute to the overall success of the PPG, called AIRHEALTH. If our program and overall aims are met, we
will define the mechanistic links of lung and heart diseases with IL-1Î² and other pathways, which will likely lead
to clinical app. of biologicals and other drugs in individuals exposed to acute and/or chronic air pollution."
10897911,"OVERALL â SUMMARY
Alzheimerâs disease (AD) is a major unresolved public health problem. Efforts to prevent or stall this disease
have failed, in good part because of inadequate understanding of its complex pathogenesis. Mounting evidence
suggest that neural network dysfunction may underlie or promote AD-related cognitive deficits and contribute to
disease progression. Yet, the causes and consequences of this dysfunction and the therapeutic potential of
counteracting it remain sorely understudied. Therefore, the overarching goal of this program project is to decode
the multifactorial etiology of AD-related neural network dysfunction and to leverage the novel mechanistic
insights we will gain toward the development of better therapeutic strategies. Through collaborative interactions
among four projects and two cores, our program will use systems neuroscience (neurophysiology and behavior)
in combination with systems biology (single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics), as well as neuropathology
and improved mouse models, to determine how copathogenic interactions among apolipoprotein (apo) E4,
amyloid-b (Ab), and tau cause neural network dysfunctions and cognitive decline in AD. An Administrative Core
will coordinate all activities. Projects 1â3 will use novel mouse models of sporadic and familial AD to study
interactions of different apoE isoforms with wildtype (WT) human tau (Project 1) or APP/Ab (Project 2), or among
apoE4, Ab, and tau that is WT or bears disease-associated amino acid substitutions (Project 3). Project 4 will
carry out single-nucleus transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses on postmortem brain tissues from deeply
phenotyped human AD cases to gain novel insights into the multifactorial etiology of the human condition,
validate leads from mouse studies, and encourage backtranslation into the models. An Integrative Data-Science
Core will help us integrate results from all projects through innovative statistical modeling. This approach will
reveal which aspects of human AD are most faithfully reproduced in the mouse models and help establish the
causal drivers of cell-specific alterations in the human tissues, increasing the mechanistic resolving power of the
latter studies. Therapeutic interventions in mouse models will determine whether reducing apoE4 expression in
specific cell types can block copathogenic effects of apoE4 and tau on brain functions (Project 1), modulating
the activity of specific interneurons can counteract copathogenic effects of apoE4 and APP/Ab (Projects 2 and
4), and knocking down tau can prevent and reverse brain dysfunction in models expressing all three pathogenic
factors (Project 3). Through these highly cohesive efforts, our program will dissect the multifactorial interactions
among AD-related pathogenic factors, define their relative contributions to the complex pathogenesis of brain
dysfunctions, and help distinguish among neuropathological alterations that cause, result from, or are
coincidental to neural network dysfunctions and cognitive decline. Sharing the diverse data sets we will generate
and disseminating the novel integrative approaches we plan to develop for their analysis could enhance the
progress of many other groups working in AD research and drug development or biomedicine in general."

We have discovered and studied three novel mechanisms relevant to severe asthma. These include the role in
severe asthma of: 1) Î²2 adrenergic receptor regulation by S-nitrosylation; 2) airway acidification; and 3) androgen
signaling. Each of these three mechanisms has the potential to be treated with novel, personalized therapies
that will be studied in a complementary fashion in the third Aim of each Project. Three synergistic proposed
Projects are proposed: Project 1, S-nitrosylation signaling in severe asthma; Project 2, airway pH regulation in
severe asthma; and Project 3, androgen signaling in severe asthma. Note that a substantial amount of the
science, and most of the proposed Cores, are currently incorporated in an NHLBI âsponsored Translational P01
at our two institutions, Indiana University and Case Western Reserve University. However, the NHLBI is not
planning to renew its Translational P01 initiative. What this means for the current proposal, however, is that the
scientific interface, as well as the Cores, are currently operational; and they are not duplicated at either institution.
We propose to continue these Core functions in the current proposal. The three Projects have scientific
synergy. For example, detrimental denitrosylation (Project 1) is reversed both by airway alkalinization (Project
2) and by airway epithelial androgen treatment (Project 3). Interleukin 17, which decreases airway epithelial S-
nitrosothiol signaling (Project 1) is inhibited by airway alkalinization (Project 2) and androgen receptor signaling
(Project 3). Interleukin 4 gene expression appears to be inhibited both by human airway alkalinization (Project
2) and by androgen receptor signaling (Project 3). These and related interactions will be studied in detail. The
Program also has robust operational synergy. Each Project will make use of each core. In particular, each
will use data and specimens from the Research Bronchoscopy and Biospecimens Core and from the Severe
Asthma Clinical Trials Core; each will use cells from the Primary Human Airway Cell Culture Core; each will rely
heavily on the Pulmonary Biostatistics Core for data analysis; and all projects and cores will be coordinated by
an Administrative Core. Note that the Administrative Core will also assist all Projects with data dissemination,
with speakers and with advisory boards. None of the three Projects would be able to support these Core
functionalities as an independent R01. At the conclusion of this Program, we anticipate having used our basic
science innovations to develop at least three novel approaches to managing severe asthma."

The overarching purpose of the Rose F. Kennedy Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center
(RFK IDDRC) is to improve the lives of children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs). Fifty-
plus years of distinguished progress in basic, translational and clinical research as one of NICHDâs flagship
IDDRCs, coupled with important recent faculty recruitments and an historic merger between the Albert Einstein
College of Medicine and its University-Affiliated Hospital, Montefiore Medical Center, offer a solid platform for
continuing excellence in our commitment to IDD research. The Centerâs 4 highly integrated scientific Cores
consist of: 1) our clinical translational core known as the Human Clinical Phenotyping (Core B, HCP), which
serves to facilitate both access to and characterization of participants for IDD relevant research; 2) a
Neurogenomics facility (Core C, NGEN) that provides cutting edge epigenetic and genomic processing and
analyses on both human and animal tissues; 3) a Neural Cell Engineering and Imaging facility (Core D,
NCEI) that provides state-of-the-art approaches to brain cell manipulation and visualization; and 4) an Animal
Phenotyping facility (Core E, AP) for evaluation of animal behavior, metabolism and imaging in a manner with
strong parallels to approaches taken in patients accessed through HCP. Each of our scientific Cores is
carefully overseen and monitored by the Administrative Core (Core A, ADM), which also serves as the head
ganglion of the entire IDDRC in its substantial outreach programs to Einstein/Montefiore, the Bronx community
as well as nationally. Each scientific Core has an essential connection to our signature Research Project
which brings together a multidisciplinary team of investigators focused on mechanisms of IDD in children with
mutations in the transcriptional regulator lysine demethylase 5c gene, KDM5C. A central function of the RFK
IDDRC is to promote the substantive links between Einstein research laboratories and clinics at the Children's
Evaluation and Rehabilitation Center (CERC) and the Childrenâs Hospital At Montefiore (CHAM). Together, our
Cores and research project form a dynamic network â a community â of IDD-focused programs and practices
that interlink 18 different academic departments, >100 IDDRC members and 20-plus IDD-relevant clinics at
Einstein and Montefiore. The latter include 22q11.2DS, Rett and Williams syndromes, tuberous sclerosis,
neurofibromatosis, West syndrome and infantile spasms, autism spectrum disorders, and a wide range of
neurometabolic disorders. New initiatives moving forward at this time include our unique precision
medicine/community outreach program we call Operation IDD Gene Team, our goal to fortify ties with our
Einstein clinical partner (CERC and its affiliated UCEDD and LEND programs) under the umbrella of the Rose
F. Kennedy Center and a heightened focus on training through our newly established T32 for IDD postdoctoral

10830984,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), continues to be a severe global
health problem. TB is multifaceted, but a central clinical and microbiologic feature of the disease is the ability of
Mtb to resist complete elimination, both by the host immune system and by chemotherapeutic agents with potent
growth inhibitory activity. This persistence in the face of immunologic and antibiotic pressure underlies several
important facets of TB disease, including 1) the existence of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and, in the setting
of immunologic failure of LTBI control, its role in the genesis of active TB and 2) the prolonged course of TB
antibiotic therapy, which requires 6 months of multidrug therapy to achieve reliable clinical cure. Rather than
producing complete bacterial eradication in all treated subjects, cure following TB chemotherapy is now
understood to be an antibiotic induced paucibacillary state in which prevention of relapse depends in part on
poorly understood host factors. The host and bacterial determinants that mediate these two interrelated types of
persistence are only partially understood, a knowledge gap the Tri-I-TBRU aims to fill. We propose a set of 3
intersecting projects and 3 cores all focused on different facets of the problem of paucibacillary TB, both post
treatment and LTBI. The projects will use samples and clinical data from TB cohorts at our clinical site at
GHESKIO in Port Au Prince Haiti, to examine the immunologic, microbiomic, transcriptomic, pharmacokinetic,
and genetic factors that influence or predict the transition points between paucibacillary states of TB disease and
active transmissible infection. These human studies will be compared and contrasted with a new mouse model
of paucibacillary infection that will allow us to test mechanistic hypotheses about the host and bacterial
determinants of paucibacillary disease. This work with be conducted by a team of highly collaborative
investigators who have who have worked well together for several years."
11014637,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The vast majority of human genes are multi-exonic and undergo alternative splicing to generate a several-
fold increase in the variety of transcripts and proteins that are produced. In diseases like cancer, splicing is often
globally aberrant and highly distinct from normal tissues, with increased levels of intron retention, alternative
splicing and usage of de novo splicing junctions. A fundamental unanswered question in RNA biology is how the
many layers that comprise the splicing code are interpreted to produce a given splicing outcome, and how these
processes become dysregulated in human diseases. The extensive crosstalk between processes occurring on
the DNA and those that act on the RNA suggest the chromatin state in particular may participate in orchestrating
alternative splicing. We have observed that random genomic integration of a splicing reporter construct results
in populations of cells corresponding to each possible splicing outcome, suggesting the genomic context at the
site of integration exerts a powerful influence on splicing. However, due primarily to technological limitations,
much remains unknown about the precise nature of the regulatory interplay between chromatin and RNA splicing
and the potential factors that may be involved. The goal of this proposal is to address the current challenges
impeding de novo discovery and develop unbiased experimental approaches to reveal hidden determinants of
splicing regulation at the chromatin level. Our approach is designed to directly connect splicing outcome with
unbiased proteomic profiling of the associated genomic region, in order to identify all of the potential chromatin
features that are involved in enforcing a particular pattern of splicing. We also propose to engineer new systems
to functionally validate a direct role for the epigenome in splicing regulation and to modulate splicing at will. Our
findings have implications for both epigenetics and RNA biology, and in particular, how their interactions
influence the various processes involved in gene expression. It also has the potential to shed insight into the
causes and consequences of the widespread epigenetic and splicing dysregulation observed in human cancer.
Importantly, our approach is not limited to the study of splicing and will also enable unbiased discovery of the
mechanisms involved in other fundamental processes."

 Cells of the immune system, bacteria, and neurons are constantly interacting on every
surface of the human body. Recent studies show that bacteria have evolved mechanisms to
engage with the nervous system, often using the phagocytes that regulate inflammation.
Neuroinflammation, or inflammation in neurological tissue, is thought to contribute to common
neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, although
the basic mechanisms of neuroinflammation remain incompletely understood. The long-term
objective of this New Innovator Award proposal is to define the molecular mechanisms of
neuroinflammation during infection. The innovation is our adaptation of the cutting-edge
zebrafish molecular toolkit (optogenetics, biosensors, in vivo biotinylation) to host-pathogen
interactions. With this system, we can genetically modify host and pathogen, then observe
bacteria invading the transparent zebrafish brain in real-time. As pathogens, we use
mycobacterial species that activate neuroinflammation in humans (TB meningitis, leprosy) and
in zebrafish. We have also developed new zebrafish brain infection models, using human
pathogens isolated from meningitis patients, in order to determine:
Project 1: How do bacteria invade the brain from the blood?
 Approach: Define the endothelial mechanisms of brain invasion and vascular injury.
Project 2: How do host versus pathogen factors drive catastrophic brain inflammation?
 Approach: Optogenetic (light-activated) control of phagocytes in vivo.
Project 3: How do host versus pathogen factors injure neurons?
 Approach: Identifying infectious mechanisms of neuronal injury using biosensors.
 To answer these questions, this proposal combines immunobiology and neurobiology
tools with brain infection models in zebrafish. Using live imaging of zebrafish brain infection,
and genetic modification of fluorescent bacteria, neurons, and phagocytes, the earliest
inflammatory and neurodegenerative events can be directly observed in unprecedented detail.
Completion of this work fulfills two goals. First, it will provide needed mechanistic information
on the host cells and molecules that mediate injury in understudied brain infections that
disproportionately affect people living in poverty. This will support the goal of developing new
therapies that limit brain inflammation. Beyond infection, the basic biological mechanisms of
neuroinflammation, revealed by infection, will likely be relevant to the many non-infectious
neurodegenerative conditions that are characterized by neuroinflammation."
11014625,"Project Summary
Human cells use signals called ""RNA second messengers"" to stimulate the immune response and prevent
disease. These signals are produced in response to pathogen infection and cellular stress, and are important for
controlling cellular communication. Recent evidence demonstrates that RNA second messenger signaling
controlled by the enzyme cyclic GMPâAMP synthase (cGAS) is a critical component of the immune response to
many types of cancer, and drug analogues developed from these natural signals are rapidly emerging as
promising new treatments. The potent antitumor potential of these drugs illustrates the importance of discovery
and mechanistic understanding of naturally occurring RNA second messenger signals.
Surprisingly, our work has revealed that cGAS is part of a broad family of signaling enzymes we named
cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase (CD-NTase) enzymes, and many RNA second messenger pathways
remain to be discovered in human biology. Potential human CD-NTases include uncharacterized immune cGAS-
like receptors previously implicated as genes frequently mutated in cancer. Our results demonstrate that RNA
second messenger signaling pathways are a new rich area of research and likely impact many areas of basic
human biology and disease. We have developed an innovative approach to uncover the function of these
enzymes and discover the biology and natural products responsible for signaling.
Our proposed research will provide a new detailed understanding of the enzymes that control RNA second
messenger signaling and enable discovery of entirely new classes of RNA signals. Specifically, the proposed
experiments will use kingdom-wide analysis of CD-NTase enzymes to determine the mechanism of specific RNA
product synthesis, X-ray crystallography to define the structural and molecular basis of metazoan CD-NTase
function, and an innovative set of cell biology experiments using newly identified CD-NTase RNA signals for
direct cell stimulation and chemical-proteomics. Our experiments will define the function of newly discovered
cGAS-like enzymes in human biology and explain the molecular rules that allow RNA second messengers to
control downstream cellular responses."

 The World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control has
identified the understanding of women and their tobacco-related issues as well as the need for
the development of gender-relevant tobacco control efforts as priorities. However, there is a
paucity of studies addressing the efficacy of gender-relevant tobacco cessation programs,
particularly in low-resource settings (including the U.S.), that take into consideration the
limitations and strengths of a health care system. We developed and established the efficacy of
a theory-based, culturally- and gender-relevant Community Health Worker (CHW) intervention
for low-income Brazilian women that augments the tobacco cessation program offered through
the public health system. This application represents the continuation of our gender-relevant
tobacco control efforts in Brazil by proposing the adaptation of this CHW-delivered tobacco
cessation program to be integrated with mHealth support through mobile devices (App). We are
proposing an integrated CHW-mHealth application that (a) is culturally- and gender-relevant, (b)
is theory-based (Social Cognitive Theory), (c) considers the existing structure of the Brazilian
health care system, and (d) will be adapted based on an efficacious intervention as well as
salient features of other mHealth applications that have been shown to be successful in
engaging users. During the R21 phase, we will make the adaptations and determine feasibility
of a CHW-delivered intervention that is integrated with a mHealth tobacco cessation application
(interactive App for participants and tracking system for CHWs) through formative assessments
among all involved stakeholders, pretesting, and pilot testing of the intervention. In the R33
phase, we will assess the effectiveness of the integrated CHW-mHealth tobacco cessation
intervention through a group randomized trial with towns as the unit of randomization (8 towns,
N=344). The comparison group will be the same as the previous intervention (consisting of a
home visit by a CHW during which the participant is scheduled to attend the tobacco cessation
program at the neighborhood public health clinic) to allow for comparisons. We hypothesize that
at 6-months, women smokers who receive the integrated CHW-mHealth intervention will have
significantly higher 7-day point prevalence abstinence (defined as no cigarettes in the past 7
days) than women smokers in the control condition. Self-report will be verified through
measurement of exhaled carbon monoxide levels among 30% of participants. If shown to be
effective, this approach could be utilized as a model for a population-based intervention in low-
resource settings, including rural and disadvantaged women in the U.S."

Chiral natural products and man-made drugs play a pivotal role in the study and treatment of a
diverse spectrum of human diseases. The presence of stereogenic centers in drug candidates
has been shown to correlate with diminished off-target toxicity, reduced CYP450 inhibition, and
an overall enhanced probability of regulatory approval as drugs. However, despite the established
importance of three-dimensionality in bioactive chemical structures, the selective synthesis of
complex organic molecules containing stereogenic centers remains a venerable challenge. The
research described in this proposal describes a conceptually new approach to the selective
formation and revision of stereogenic centers through the stereoconvergent epimerization of Câ
H bonds. In contrast to the vast majority of stereoselective transformations, which establish the
absolute and relative configuration of a stereogenic center during a key bond-formation step, our
approach introduces the opportunity to enrich or invert individual stereocenters after bond
connectivity has been finalized. Our strategy thus decouples the strategies needed to establish
bond connectivity from the strategies needed to establish the three-dimensional configuration of
a complex molecule. By targeting the most ubiquitous functional group, CâH bonds, this tool has
expansive potential. If successful, the research program proposed here is anticipated to transform
chemical synthesis, dramatically reducing the time and resources necessary to synthesize
complex, bioactive molecules. Fundamental mechanistic findings revealed en route to this goal
are further anticipated to contribute significantly to our ability to understand reactivity and
selectivity patterns in the context of complex molecular environments.

10834925,"ABSTRACT - Metabolic determinants of Mtb virulence, vulnerability and variation
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has emerged as the world's most deadly pathogen based in large part on
the highly unusual biological and chemical properties of its cell envelope. Comprised of a distinctive
hydrophobic outer mycolate membrane, anchored to an underlying complex of polysaccharide and
peptidoglycan polymers, the Mtb envelope serves as both the primary interface with, and barrier to, the human
host. In human tuberculosis (TB) disease the Mtb envelope mediates a years-long standoff, and serves as the
barrier to all anti-mycobacterial drugs. Yet, knowledge of its native composition, variation and regulation of
drug entry remains fragmentary. This team of applicants has created new genetic and metabolomic tools to
comprehensively dissect and analyze the metabolite and lipid components of the Mtb envelope on an
organism-wide basis across a large set of clinical isolates. Moreover, this TBRU proposes to provide the first
descriptions of cell envelope variation among isolates from human patients and identify key determinants of its
virulence and barrier to drug action that could inform the development of better diagnostics and therapeutics.
Structures of new molecules will first be determined using synthetic chemistry and mass spectrometry. The
genes encoding these metabolites will then be identified and functionally validated using new genome-scale
CRISPR interference technologies, assays for penetration into the cell envelope, and genetically defined
mouse models of in vivo growth. Using mass spectrometry, we will solve the structures of up to 250 surface
barrier lipids and more than 41 gene-lipid pairs that dominate in cell envelope variation among patients.
Patient-derived Mtb strains will be obtained from clinical samples collected at our field sites in Masiphumelele,
South Africa, where we will implement clinically relevant technology for detection of live Mtb in exhaled (non-
coughed) human bioaerosols. Studies of barrier function place special emphasis on rifampicin as a model
compound due to its clinical importance as a frontline drug and role as a defining element of drug resistant TB.
The ability to analyze patient urine and serum has further resulted in the discovery of new biomarkers of
disease activity and response to drug therapy, motivating linked translational efforts to advance the
development of non-sputum based, real time point-of-care diagnostic tests. This highly interactive group of
scientists thus seeks to provide better drugs and diagnostic tests, as well as a deep and durable scientific
foundation for understanding of the Mtb envelope, especially the particular genes and molecules that control
active remodeling, drug action and human host response."

Achieving tolerance, defined as long-term allograft survival in the absence of ongoing immunosuppression, is
the ultimate goal in transplantation. Tolerance of kidney allografts has been achieved in non-human primates
(NHPs) and in humans using a combination of non-myeloablative conditioning and donor bone marrow
transplantation (DMBT) that results in transient donor chimerism. However, until now, transient mixed-chimerism
protocols that achieve long-term tolerance of kidney allografts in NHPs have consistently failed to induce
tolerance in recipients of heart allografts. It is well known that some organs, such as kidney and liver, are
âtolerance-proneâ while others, such as heart and lung, are âtolerance-resistant.â Despite the immune barriers
posed by the heart, our laboratory has recently developed novel protocols that have, for the first time, achieved
long-term, stable tolerance of heart transplants in cynomolgus monkey recipients. This remarkable result was
attained in heart recipients exhibiting only transient mixed chimerism by including donor kidney cotransplantation,
which enhanced the contributions of host regulatory T cells following mixed chimerism conditioning. While the
combination of kidney and heart transplantation produced remarkable results, this strategy does not have wide
clinical feasibility due to the use of experimental agents and the ethical barrier of sacrificing a kidney simply to
induce heart tolerance. Although lung allografts will not be studied in this Program, our recent findings in lung
recipients provide proof of principle that durable mixed chimerism can be achieved in NHPs and that this state
results in long term tolerance of resistant thoracic organs; these were the first NHPs to become tolerant of lung
allografts. Thus, the unifying goal of this overall Program is to design innovative mixed chimerism
strategies for heart alone recipients that either amplify the contributions of regulatory T cells and
macrophages in transient mixed chimerism protocols (Project 1) or achieve durable mixed chimerism
(Project 2) while using clinically-relevant agents for host conditioning (Project 3). Project 1 will focus on
enhancing the contribution of regulatory T cells and macrophages in protocols which induce transient mixed
chimerism. Project 2 will focus on achieving durable mixed chimerism using next-generation conditioning
regimens, innovative immunosuppression platforms. Project 3 will investigate novel, clinically-applicable, agents
which enhance costimulation blockade and diminish toxicity. Core A will investigate the mechanisms by which
treatments described in Projects 1-3 influence the host immune response. The Program will be organized in such
a way that early mechanistic discoveries/advances in Core A will inform and refine the aims of Projects 1-3. The
complementary models and approaches described in this application are unique strengths of this program
project. We anticipate that together, these highly interactive projects will generate one or more safe and effective
tolerance protocols that will be ready for clinical trial(s) in heart allograft recipients by the end of the funding
period."

The Mayo Clinic Multiple Myeloma SPORE (SPORE) is a dynamic, productive, translational cancer research
program based at all three Mayo Clinic sites (Rochester MN, Jacksonville FL, Phoenix AZ), now with input from
the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto, Ontario. From 2003-2013 we participated in the joint
DFCI/Mayo Clinic Multiple Myeloma SPORE, and since 2015 in the Mayo Clinic Multiple Myeloma SPORE. At
the center of the ongoing success of the SPORE is the collaborative interaction between investigators
throughout the Mayo Foundation, as well as SPORE basic laboratory, translational and clinical investigators
and patient advocates focused on MM. The overall goal of the SPORE is to support innovative, interactive,
rigorous translational myeloma research that leverages the expertise of laboratory, translational and clinical
expertise. Over the last funding period, the SPORE has been highly productive as demonstrated by
identification of new tumor markers and prognostic indices that are being used clinically; scientific findings that
led to innovative clinical trials both within and outside the SPORE; multiple publications with many authored by
investigators from multiple sites; and brisk accrual to translational clinical trials. The SPORE was involved in
multiple productive vertical and horizontal collaborations with other national and international academic
institutions and organizations. For example, with leadership of clinical efforts in patient-focused clinical trials
from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, International Myeloma Foundation, and MyelomaCrowd. The
current proposal includes 3 major research projects. Two of the projects are new, based on research results
obtained over the past funding period, while Project 1 is a continuation of efforts to investigate ways of
modulating the immune micro-environment to improve the efficacy of oncolytic viral therapy in MM in a phase I
clinical trial. Project 2 is an integrated multi-omic analysis of high-risk MM with associated clinical trial highly
focused on identifying promising approaches in this group of patients that have not benefited from recent
advances. Project 3 is investigating the genetic and microenvironmental mechanisms of progression of
smoldering MM to MM to enable early detection of MM requiring treatment. The SPORE also includes
Developmental Research and Career Enhancement Programs to pursue novel translational concepts in MM
research and new investigators through the programs respectively. Finally, the SPORE will enhance the
infrastructure that supports translational MM research through shared core resources in Administration,
Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, and Biospecimens & Clinical Database."

The ability of cells to efficiently communicate across organismal-level distances and difficult-to-surmount
biological barriers is one of the most important fundamental phenomena in biology. A vast body of literature has
revealed that such cell-to-cell communication is mediated via membrane-enclosed particles called extracellular
vesicles, which are released by cells into their surroundings and contain lipids, ligands, nucleic acids, and
proteins. Such extracellular vesicles represent one of the only natural non-viral structures by means of which
âsourceâ cells can reprogram the genetics and fate of âtargetâ cells, and as such, they are implicated not only in
the regulation of nearly every cellular process but also in the development of nearly every tissue within the human
body. Moreover, these vesicles play essential roles in various disease states and pathological conditions,
including cancer progression, neurodegeneration, musculoskeletal disorders, cardiovascular degradation,
metabolic syndromes, and wound healing. Given their ubiquity and crucial biological roles, extracellular vesicles
hold great promise for clinical diagnostics and therapeutics, but to date, such applications have been hindered
by key challenges associated with 1) fundamentally understanding extracellular vesicle formation in source cells,
2) loading extracellular vesicles with biomolecular cargo in high yield, 3) controllably regulating extracellular
vesicle production with external stimuli, 4) delivering extracellular vesicles to target cells over tissue-relevant
length scales, 5) maintaining the long-term biological activity of extracellular vesicle-internalized cargo, and 6)
implementing extracellular vesicle-based treatment strategies in living animals. Herein, by drawing inspiration
from proteins and structures found in cephalopod skin cells and leveraging the technical foundation established
for cephalopod-inspired bioelectronic devices, we propose to solve all of the scientific and technological
challenges currently impeding clinical applications of extracellular vesicles. The envisioned research plan
involves 1) validating electrical techniques for controlling the release of extracellular vesicles from genetically
engineered cells interfaced with different bioelectronic devices and platforms, 2) developing strategies for
remotely and wirelessly controlling the release of biomolecular cargo-loaded extracellular vesicles from
engineered cells interfaced into implantable bioelectronic systems, and 3) demonstrating that remotely controlled
release of clinically valuable cargo-loaded extracellular vesicles by implanted bioelectronic system-integrated
source cells can guide target cell fate and tissue development in living animals. Altogether, the successful
completion of the proposed work will enable harnessing of extracellular vesicle-mediated cell-to-cell
communication pathway for the regulation of physiological processes and will thus furnish transformative
opportunities for developing unprecedented next generation diagnostic and therapeutic technologies."

Aging is the major risk factor for cancer incidence, with more than 60% of cancer diagnoses occurring in those
aged 65 and above. In addition, anecdotal observations indicate that age affects prognosis and outcome. Yet,
very little experimental data dissect the connection of aging, cancer progression and sensitivity to anti-cancer
therapies. In fact, the vast majority of preclinical research that guide the discovery of novel therapeutic targets
and clinical trials that lead to anti-cancer treatments approved by the FDA neglect to account for the age of the
average patient. This lack of understanding of how aging plays a role in cancer is especially troubling considering
that the number of new cancer cases is on the rise globally, a fact that is tied to the increase in the proportion of
the older population in the world. Biologically the aging process affects the function of every cell in an organism
suggesting that a cancer developing in an aged host is a different disease than a cancer developing in a young
one. Using human serum samples, I recently demonstrated that tumor progression and metastasis formation
occur, at least in part, as a manifestation of global metabolic deregulation of the aged host. This supports the
idea that the role of aging in cancer goes far beyond increased exposure time to mutagens and puts the aging
process at the center stage coordinating the different aspects required for the evolution of malignant phenotypes.
Therefore, in order to effectively treat cancer, we must look beyond the current framework which neglects the
role of the cancer patientâs age. Here, we propose that the aged host tumor microenvironment exerts distinct
Darwinian pressures that combined with the decline of the host anti-cancer defenses define how tumor cells
evolve within the primary tumor, progress into metastatic disease and respond to anti-cancer therapies.
Employing a combination of cutting-edge bulk and single cell technologies we expect to systematically delineate
how aging affects the phenotypes and genotypes of cancer cells as well as to characterize the effects of the
aging process on the composition and interactions of the different components of the tumor microenvironment.
Finally, we will directly evaluate if old age affects the response to FDA-approved chemotherapeutic regiments
and immunotherapies, and evaluate if strategies known to rejuvenate old tissues can affect the response to these
therapeutic interventions. Through these studies, we aim to build the knowledge infrastructure required to design
therapeutic strategies that account for the reprogramming that occurs with aging."

Overall
Nevada (NV) is one of the 24 Institutional Development Award (IDeA) states affected by restricted research
capacity. The overarching goal of our Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) Center for
Neurodegeneration and Translational Neuroscience (CNTN) is to establish translational neuroscience research
infrastructure in Southern NV to develop innovative diagnostic methods and therapeutic interventions that can be
applied across neurodegenerative disorders (NDD) and in diverse populations. The CNTN is highly significant
for State representatives given the upcoming needs of age-related NDD healthcare due to the sustained increase
in the population of NV, including retirees.
 Our thematically cohesive, multidisciplinary team comprises investigators from both the Cleveland Clinic Lou
Ruvo Center for Brain Health, Las Vegas (LRCBH), and the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV). During the
first five years of COBRE support, the CNTN has transformed the environment for translational neuroscience
research in Southern NV. The main accomplishments of CNTN Phase 1 are: 1- the creation of a Brain Imaging
Department at LRCBH dedicated to research endeavors; 2- the building of a research cohort comprising NDD
subjects who are deeply phenotyped; 3- the establishment of a Data Management and Statistics Core; 4- the
inauguration of a Department of Brain Health, whose Founding Chair was a CNTN Junior Investigator (JI); 5- the
forming of a Community Advisory Board to assist with community outreach activities aimed at inviting diverse
individuals to volunteer in clinical research projects; and 6- the increase in the critical mass of investigators. A
promising group of JIs have leveraged the resources compiled by the CNTN to carry out highly innovative
research projects. All the JIs have graduated from the CNTN program with independent funding and promotion
within local or external high caliber institutions. Our Assessment Unit has created new assessment methods
based on a Science of Team Science approach to assess the performance of each individual CNTN Core and JI.
They demonstrated that increasing the size of a scientific networking results in the inflation of scientific products.
 In Phase 2, the CNTN intends to develop the resources and processes necessary to reach sustainability. For
this, we are revising the CNTN leadership to tackle growing responsibilities. The evaluation reports produced by
our Assessment Unit will be utilized to elaborate our strategy, monitor progress, and make eventual adjustments.
Specifically, we plan to foster infrastructure development, strengthen the career development of CNTN
investigators, launch a pilot project program, and stimulate research productivity. We anticipate that our efforts
will result in new collaborations with academic and industry partners, which will put the CNTN on the path for
sustainability."

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene. The
E342K (PI*Z) mutant allele is very common among those of European ancestry, and E342K
homozygotes encode a protein with impaired secretion, resulting in deficient AAT serum levels.
Since AAT normally protects elastin in the lung from degradation, loss of effective AAT triggers
lung inflammation, airways obstruction and emphysema, which is the primary life-limiting
manifestation of AATD. The projects within this proposal seek to pursue numerous parallel
strategies to develop a gene therapy for AATD. Most of these strategies revolve around the use
of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-based vectors, a platform technology that has
been very successful for other genetic diseases. In Project 1, optimized rAAV vectors will be
studied in genetically defined animal models (including mice and ferrets) in comparison with
transgenic reconstitution studies using a regulated conditional transgenic system to compare
two relevant potential target replacement levels (11ÂµM and 25ÂµM) and clinically relevant
endpoints will be studied. In Project 2, novel CRISPR variants will be used for gene editing,
base editing and prime editing strategies to treat AATD. In Project 3, we will screen naturally
occurring AAV capsid libraries obtained from remote populations in Western China to identify
capsids with enhanced efficacy and safety for AATD gene therapy. Finally, in project 4, we will
use novel Treg and CAR-Treg strategies to selectively modulate anti-vector immune responses.
There will also be two cores. Core A will provide each project with important Vector
Immunology assays, which can identify limitations due to host immune responses to AAV
capsids, the AAT transgene or to Cas9-derived proteins. Core B will provide animal models and
physiologic measurements in the animal models for testing of optimized rAAV vectors, gene
editing tools and immune modulation approaches. Program investigators have a track record of
interactions and collaborations that we anticipate will continue in future years."
10906854,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Overall Project
The strategic vision of the Precision Aging Network (PAN) is to develop the essential scientific knowledge to
understand the discrepancy that currently exists between cognitive healthspan and human lifespan. We must
reveal the neural mechanisms that 1) account for optimal brain performance in old age resulting in healthy
cognitive function, and 2) those that underlie decline in brain function leading to age-related cognitive
impairment (ARCI), Alzheimerâs disease (AD), or Alzheimerâs disease-related dementias (ADRD). The ultimate
goal of the PAN is to develop not only a strong scientific foundation for the essential knowledge needed to
match cognitive healthspan with human lifespan, but also to leverage big data approaches that apply precision
medicine concepts to prolong optimal brain function. To achieve this goal of sustaining optimal cognitive
function in old age, and to extend quality of life for people across levels of risk for ARCI, AD, or ADRD,
we maintain that methodologies such as those developed and implemented in the PAN will be required.
Although âchronological ageâ is consistently associated with increasing incidence of disability, including chronic
brain disorders such as AD and ADRD, the exact mechanistic relationships between âbiological ageâ and
decline in brain function is not known. The number of people now living with some form of dementia is
estimated to be 50 million worldwide, which is expected to double every 20 years. Because of the enormous
heterogeneity in brain and cognitive function among individuals in their 70s, 80s and 90s, the urgent challenge
for science, medicine and healthcare providers is to discover interventions that are individually effective in
delaying or preventing ARCI, AD, or ADRD.
Untangling the complex relationship between age and cognitive performance requires a strategy that includes
the study of very large, diverse, well-characterized and longitudinally sampled populations. This will require
âbig dataâ but also the means to translate the massive amounts of information gathered into âsmart dataâ or
âknowledgeâ. This demands radically different conceptual models. Currently, no single approach adequately
identifies the means to modify personal aging trajectories for improved brain health in individuals. The
approach proposed in PAN is designed to overcome obstacles of earlier methods. The focus is on how to
distinguish the various combinations of age, sex, genetics, race-ethnicity, health, lifestyle choices and
environmental factors that influence brain drivers that increase susceptibility to dysfunction, as well as
those factors that increase brain protection and resistance against dysfunction.
The fundamental principle of the precision medicine approach is to âindividualizeâ. This will enable strong
and specific predictions for each person to close the gap between cognitive healthspan and human
lifespan. The root of this concept is in the teachings of Hippocrates, who said â âIt is more important to know
what sort of person has a disease than to know what sort of disease a person has.â"
10929957,"OVERALL - SUMMARY
This is a joint application for a program project grant by Massachusetts General Hospital and MD Anderson
Cancer Center. The progress we made in our most recent program projects (a P01 and a U19) has been criti-
cal to the clinical, physical, and biological aspects of proton therapy and its significance as an important cancer
treatment modality. The main achievements of the recently completed U19 (end date 8/31/20) were (1) the de-
velopment and activation of definitive esophagus, liver and glioma randomized proton vs. photon therapy trials
in cooperation with NRG, NCI and NCTN; (2) understanding and modeling the differences in response of nor-
mal tissues to highly disparate proton and photon dose distribution patterns; (3) understanding the complexities
of the biological effects of protons relative to photons; and (4) the development of advanced intensity modu-
lated proton therapy incorporating physical uncertainties and the variable biological effectiveness of protons.
Our research also revealed major gaps in the knowledge of the biological effects of protons, significant limita-
tions of the current population-based models of normal tissue and tumor response to protons vs. photons, and
uncertainty in the appropriateness of proton therapy in the face of heterogeneities in patient characteristics and
treatment techniques in unselected groups of patients. On the bright side, our research also discovered the
strong potential of proton therapy to reduce suppression of the immune system, which is commonly associated
with photon therapy and has been shown to lead to adverse outcomes. The overall goals of the proposed
P01 are (a) understanding relative clinical, biological and immunosuppressive effects of proton therapy vs.
photon therapy; (b) enhancing outcomes based on the physical, biological and immunological properties of
protons and photons; and (c) applying individualized (as opposed to population-based) approaches for the se-
lection of the optimum radiation modality for each patient and to enhance the potential for outcomes with the
use of radiation dose distributions tailored to the individual patientâs baseline and tumor characteristics. The
achievement of these goals will be carried out in three projects. Project 1: Understanding Normal Tissue Tox-
icity to Identify Patients Most Likely to Benefit from Proton vs. Photon Therapy; Project 2: Radiation-Induced
Lymphopenia (RIL): Understanding, Predictive Modeling and Developing Photon and Proton-Based Mitigation
Strategies; and Project 3: Investigating Enhanced Sensitivity of Tumors to Proton Beam Therapy: Mechanisms
and Biomarkers. The projects are highly integrated in that decisions regarding treatment modality selection,
treatment technique and optimization to maximally enhance the therapeutic ratio cannot be accomplished by
any one project alone. Such decisions must consider and balance normal tissue complications, tumor re-
sponse based on genotypic factors, and radiation-induced immunosuppression. The three projects will be sup-
ported by an Administrative Core and three resource cores: Core 1: Data Management and Computational
Support; Core 2: Translational Biospecimens and Imaging Biomarkers; and Core 3: Biostatistics."

10919173,"OVERALL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The proposed renewal of this P01 builds upon the longstanding International Tobacco Control (ITC) Policy
Evaluation Project, which has used cross-country comparisons and a common mediation model to evaluate the
behavioral impacts of national-level tobacco control policies. The current P01 has extensively researched and
documented the transitions between cigarettes and nicotine vaping products and how policies impact their use.
For the renewal period, we are adding heated tobacco products, thus extending our previous two-product
model to three products, but otherwise maintaining a similar team structure and research approach. The goal
of this P01 renewal application is to address the question âWhat have different countries done to regulate
tobacco products and how has this impacted tobacco use behaviors?â Our common integrated theoretical
framework enables us to examine how and why policies and industry actions exert effects, as well as explore
under what conditions products or policy interventions might translate into actual population-level impacts. We
focus on the well-established 4 `P's' â product, price, placement, and promotion, and how public health policy
and industry actions impact consumer perceptions, behavior, and ultimately health endpoints. Comparing the
experiences of different countries with varying regulatory approaches is intended to inform United States public
policy, based upon the best science available to maximize population health. To accomplish this, we propose
to analyze policies and industry actions in different jurisdictions to answer the following three integrated
questions: 1) Does the policy/industry action have an impact? (causality); 2) Under what conditions is it
effective? (moderation); and 3) How is it effective? (mediation). The proposed studies assess direct and
indirect or unintended effects that can affect the overall impact of a policy or action. We propose to conduct this
work with four inter-related Projects, an Administrative Core, and two Shared Resource Cores, which
collectively will: 1) track cohorts of adult tobacco users in 7 countries; 2) conduct repeated cross sectional
surveys of youth and young adults in 3 countries; 3) utilize the Experimental Tobacco Marketplace to evaluate
the effects of product availability, policy actions, and the illicit marketplace; and 4) perform statistical modeling
using input from the Projects to predict consumer response. The three P01 specific aims are to: 1) understand
how policies and industry actions impact consumer behavior; 2) develop scientific methods for assessing
response to policies; and 3) forecast population impact of different policy approaches."
11093232,"Detailed Engagement Plan
The National Institutes of Health Common Fundâs Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project was
launched in 2010 with a goal of providing the scientific community with a resource for the study of human
gene expression and regulation across multiple tissues, to specifically provide insights into the mechanisms
of gene regulation and disease-related perturbations, and to further our understanding of the role that
inherited genetic variation plays in susceptibility to complex diseases. The project enrolled 960 recently
deceased, adult donors and collected close to 49,000 tissue samples. Core data generation was
completed at the end of 2017, with the primary data types including whole genome (WGS, 30X) and whole
exome (WES, 100X) sequence data on all donors, and RNA-sequence data from at least 25,000 samples
spanning 53 human tissues/organs. This dataset constitutes the largest multi-tissue RNA sequence data
resource generated to date (a previous study of genetic effects on gene expression, TwinsUK/EUROBATS,
generated ~2,700 RNA-seq samples from four accessible tissue sites). The GTEx resource also includes
a rich and well annotated collection of donor, sample, and experiment metadata. Furthermore, additional
molecular data types, aimed at enhancing the core data sets, are still being produced, including mass
spectrometry-based proteomics, measurements of DNA methylation, histone marks (ChIP-seq), somatic
DNA sequencing, and DNase I hypersensitivity sites.
The GTEx resource includes both protected-access and open-access data (Fig. 1). The protected-access
data include extensive sample, subject and technical metadata and raw sequence BAM files from RNAseq,
whole genome (WGS) and whole exome (WES) sequencing, ChIP-seq and m6A RNA-seq, as well as
protected data derived from these such as genotype calls in VCF format. An approved dbGaP application
is required to obtain all protected-access data, including access to the raw sequence data, which are
accessible on the AnVIL platform (on Google Cloud Platform; GCP). The GTEx data also include a large
amount of open-access data, such as gene and transcript expression quantifications, cis- and trans-expression
and splicing QTLs, histology images of every tissue, some eGTEx data summaries, the sample
biobank, and a very limited set of de-identified sample and subject metadata. All of these public data are
available for download, and as interactive visualizations and summary tables on the GTEx portal.
The GTEx project has developed an extensive suite of tools and analysis pipelines that have been
benchmarked, optimized and implemented in GCP for the project (such as the RNA-seq alignment,
quantification, and QC pipeline, and the QTL analysis pipeline). These pipelines were also selected by the
TOPMed project to produce a harmonized resource of RNA sequence data across the large number of
cohorts being sequenced for that project (>20,000 samples to date); our team was involved in initial
benchmarking and harmonization tests of our pipeline across TOPMed sequencing centers and are actively
involved in ongoing data production and analyses. Moreover, very similar pipelines are used by the
ENCODE project, thus facilitating comparisons across large datasets that would be prohibitive in terms of
costs and computational resources in the absence of harmonized pipelines. We have also created
numerous visualizations developed specifically for the open access data on the GTEx portal. The GTEx
project has a very large user community: the GTEx data have the second largest number of Data Access
Requests for protected data in dbGaP (behind TCGA), and it is the most frequently downloaded dbGaP
project. An even larger number of users access the data, tools and interactive visualizations on the GTEx
portal: in the 2019 calendar year, the GTEx portal had 135,000 users (~12,000-18,000/month) worldwide,
with users spiking in October 2019 following the release of the V8 data. The GTEx consortium has published
numerous papers describing the dataset and analyses of the data, and two additional data releases are
still planned."
11087326,"Over the past three decades, there have been alarming upward trends in the rates of maternal
morbidity and mortality in the United States. Overall, the identified clinical causes of maternal
death are: cardiovascular conditions (14%), hemorrhage (13%), infection (11%) embolism
(10%), cardiomyopathy (95), mental health conditions (9%) and preeclampsia/eclampsia (8%)
but these conditions vary by race/ethnicity. For Black, non-Hispanic women, the two leading
causes of death were cardiomyopathy and cardiovascular conditions, and mental conditions
was the leading cause among White, non-Hispanic women.1 Obesity, hypertension, smoking,
opioid use and sleep disorders are also conditions and behaviors that have been found to be
associated with maternal morbidity such as hemorrhage, preeclampsia and cardiomyopathy.
These could potentially be addressed in primary care before and between pregnancies.2-6
The National Heart, Lung Blood Institute (NHLBI) is participating in a trans-National Institutes of
Health (NIH) effort to improve womenâs health, particularly maternal morbidity and mortality. A
plan â Advancing Science for the Health of Women, The Trans-NIH Strategic Plan for Womenâs
Health Research â was developed for the period 2019 â 2023. This plan provides a framework
that recognizes the complex interactions of multiple factors that affect womenâs health across
the life course, including pregnancy. Life course theory posits that health development begins
before conception and continues across the life span. It suggests that a complex play of
biologic, behavioral, psychological, and social protective and risk factors contribute to health
outcomes, and that health status reflects the cumulative lifetime exposure to these factors. The
guiding principles for this plan are consideration of the complex factors affecting womenâs
health, the inclusion of diverse populations that are disproportionately affected by morbidity and
mortality, and active engagement of a diverse group of scientists.7
The NIH approach to reducing maternal morbidity and mortality will aim to enhance health
disparities research, increase the understanding of social determinants and other risk factors
(including environmental risk factors), improve care (antepartum, intrapartum and postpartum)
and management, provide insight to psychological exposures such as stress, discrimination and
caregiving, understand coping behaviors in families affected by maternal morbidity or mortality,
and investigate the role of implicit bias in the health care systems regarding pregnancy.8 Within
NHLBI, maternal and womenâs health priorities span all of the objectives of the NHLBI strategic
vision, and NHLBI has supported a number of maternal health programs looking at
hypertension, sleep disorders, and other pregnancy complications including pre-eclampsia,
eclampsia, and gestational diabetes.
The goal of the NHLBI 3M Administrative Coordinating Center (3M ACC) is to engage
communities and networks in areas that experience high levels of maternal morbidity and
mortality. The 3M ACC will support the preliminary work necessary to identify and prepare a
group of community-based organizations to respond to future funding opportunities. The 3M
ACC will develop the infrastructure to support this group of Maternal Morbidity and Mortality
Regional Coalitions (3M RCs) and provide scientific support and coordination to NHLBI on
emerging scientific needs. Specifically, the 3M ACC will support these programmatic objectives:
â¢ï· Identify research groups and organizations with existing and relevant expertise and
community partnerships.
â¢ï· Conduct landscape analyses and community-informed needs assessments.
â¢ï· Identify within each community implementation opportunities and barriers to improve
delivery of evidence-based care to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality.
â¢ï· Develop and conduct early-stage tests of implementation approaches to identify potential
strategies to ensure the proposed approaches are acceptable, feasible, scalable, and
sustainable and to identify barriers."

10912487,"OVERALL ABSTRACT
Although we have made great strides in our understanding of the biology and treatment of chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL) over the past decade, Richter's syndrome (RS) or the transformation of CLL to aggressive
lymphoma remains an area of unmet need in the clinical care of CLL patients. The challenges presented by RS
mandate large-scale interdisciplinary approaches to more completely link genomic and protein-level features
with cellular behavior so that more precise and sensitive molecular-based diagnostic schema and more effective
treatments for this devastating disease can be devised. Our hypothesis is that genomic and epigenomic
alterations define the trajectory from CLL to RS and that distinct subtypes of RS exist, leading to distinct
phenotypic behaviors. Our approach to address the challenge of understanding RS builds from the strengths
of our highly interactive and multi-disciplinary program in CLL research. Over the last funding period, we have
succeeded in generating the largest CLL `map' to date, integrating genetic, transcriptomic and methylome data
with clinical annotation from over 1000 CLL samples to discover clinically meaningful subtypes of disease and
novel driver alterations. From this information, we have also generated genetically-faithful CLL mouse models
reflective of human disease, defined patterns of disease kinetics and therapeutic resistance, and identified new
therapeutic vulnerabilities. Over the next 5 years, we will leverage the new resources generated by our Program,
ranging from computational to functional, genetic and phenotypic readouts, to confront the challenge of
understanding and addressing RS. Thus, our vision is that we will enact a precision approach for
understanding the distinct biology of disease transformation and the subtypes of disease, and perform functional
analyses of responses to small molecules and immunotherapy agents, that could be integrated and lead to a
paradigm shift in the detection and treatment for this disease. These highly translational initiatives are strongly
supported by the expertise of the Core Leaders. Our overarching goal is thus to revolutionize the clinical
outcomes of patients with this devastating disease and to utilize the information discovered from this Program to
motivate the rational design of the next generation of personalized and even curative therapies for RS."
11062752,"A major challenge in neuroscience is to uncover how defined neural circuits in the brain encode, store,
modify, and retrieve information. Adding to this challenge is the fact that neural function does not
operate in isolation from but rather within living, behaving animals. To tackle this challenge, significant
advancement of neural, behavioral, and computational tools is needed along with new experimental
approaches to enable the detailed study of neural circuits within the context of complex behavior and
naturalistic, ethologically relevant environments. This proposal aims to do exactly this by designing,
implementing, and sharing a highly innovative, community driven, neuro-behavioral recording and real-
time processing platform capable of uninterrupted, months-long wireless recording of neural and
behavioral activity across a colony of animals in large, naturalistic environments.
We will develop a new generation of ultra-light weight, fully wireless miniature microscopes
(Miniscopes) for neural imaging in truly naturally behaving animals. These wireless Minsicopes will be
powered remotely through power-over-distance technology and capable of imaging neural activity with
single cell resolution across thousands of neurons. In combination with transgenic mouse lines, these
wireless Miniscopes will continuously record neural activity across months as animals live,
uninterrupted, in large, enriched environments. An extensive array of behavioral devices will be
developed and natively integrated into the platform for animal tracking, parsing complex behaviors, and
detecting animal-environment interactions. All tools and techniques built for this project will be actively
shared through our open-source website and workshops. Neural and behavioral data will be processed,
in real-time, through a novel computational framework (hardware and software) and shared openly
through an online database accessible to the neuroscience community.
Pilot experiments using this platform will investigate the long-term formation, stability, and
generalization of hippocampal cognitive maps within ethologically relevant environments. Once
validated, subsequent experiments will incorporate tasks proposed by the neuroscience community
encompassing both basic science and investigation of neurological disorders. A single dataset
generated with this platform will track a colony of animalsâ complex behavior and neural activity through
learning, recall, sleep, social behavior, and aging. This novel approach has the potential to
fundamentally transform the way neuroscience research is thought about, implemented, and shared
and will undoubtedly provide new insight into neural function and disorder."
11014629,"PROJECT SUMMARY
From the moment of conception until death, metazoans face relentless assault on their tissues, their cells, and their
genomes. The ability of intricately patterned biological tissues to dynamically withstand these challenges is essential
for adult life but is tested first â and perhaps most critically â during embryonic development. Early failures of
embryonic patterning can lead to rapid and premature lethality, long-lasting birth defects, and/or devastating
developmental disorders. Over the years, developmental biologists have made great progress in understanding
many of the links connecting environmental and genetic perturbations to their consequences in embryos, generally
by applying reductionist approaches (e.g. single-gene mutant phenotypes, single-clone fate mapping). However, a
significant proportion of human pregnancies still result in developmental defects or miscarriages of unknown cause.
At present, we also often fail to understand why certain perturbations result in failed embryogenesis in some
individuals, but not in others. One persisting challenge is that any model of developmental patterning must
simultaneously take into account many elements of a complex system: multiple cell types, each exerting both
intrinsic and non-autonomous behaviors, cell turnover dynamics, lineage relationships, and many hundreds of
genetic factors.
 To address these challenges, we are establishing a new experimental paradigm for studies of
developmental biology that leverages microfluidics, single-cell genomics, computational biology, and a powerful in
vivo molecular genetic model of vertebrate embryogenesis, the laboratory zebrafish (Danio rerio). Under this
paradigm, we seek a new form of biological reductionism: comprehensive, molecular decomposition of
vertebrate embryonic tissues into their constituent cell states, at an experimental scale not previously
accessible to developmental biologists (e.g. 104â106 single-cell measurements per experiment, combined with
whole-genome or whole-transcriptome resolution). In this application, we present our motivation and our vision for
the whole-embryo single-cell state landscape as a versatile experimental and conceptual platform for systems-
level interrogation of vertebrate embryogenesis. Using this landscape approach, we will systematically quantify
developmental robustness (i.e. âcanalizationâ) of all embryonic tissues to identify reoccurring bottlenecks and
vulnerabilities that drive human birth defects. In parallel, we will dissect mechanisms for cell fate control that
direct the âflowâ of cells down the embryonic landscape, particularly in contexts where individual cells differ in their
genetic and/or developmental fitness. Our experimental vision will therefore revisit fundamental questions in
developmental biology, formulated nearly 8 decades ago, but which have persisted until now as abstract principles
rather than as testable hypotheses. We anticipate this research program will accelerate our collective efforts to
better understand organizing principles of developmental ontogeny in vertebrates in health and disease."
10874586,"ABSTRACT - OVERALL
Until recently, Tuberculosis (TB) has been viewed as a disease that progresses over several discrete stages,
principally consisting of a period of infection followed by either active TB disease or a latent state with the
potential for reactivation. Similarly, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of TB, has been
viewed as a relatively stable bacterium with little genomic diversity, predictable causes of antibiotic resistance,
and phenotypic uniformity both during culture and within its infected host. However, recent findings, many
spearheaded by the members of this application, have begun to discover unexpected heterogeneity in TB
disease states, host responses, the genotypes and phenotypes of the bacteria, and among the apparently clonal
infecting population of Mtb. The premise for this program is that the heterogenous outcomes of TB infections
and treatments are determined by the interplay between heterogeneous host-bacteria transcriptional and
metabolic programs. Host and bacteria may be pre-programmed phenotypically or genetically to progress from
TB infection to TB disease; and to do so rapidly or slowly; and, with or without extensive inflammation and lung
damage. Immune tolerance, evasion or subversion may be another result of these interactions, which could lead
to worsening disease and adverse treatment outcomes including relapse. Drug tolerance or resistance is another
result of these interactions that may have widespread effects on treatment responses. Although Mtb-host and
Mtb-drug interactions would seem to be unrelated, we will also study the possibility that immune and drug tolerant
Mtb share a number of transcriptional and metabolic programs; and thus, also share some of the same
vulnerabilities that could provide therapeutic targets. Consisting of 4 Projects and 3 Cores, this program will be
accomplished in the following Specific Aims: 1) To determine the effects of bacterial and host heterogeneity on
the manifestations, progression and consequences of close exposure to TB in the household, and of active TB.
Addressed in Project 1: Bacterial and Host Determinants of Progression, Manifestations and Consequences of
TB. 2) To uncover the immunological mechanisms underlying the diverse clinical outcomes in hosts infected with
high and low transmission strains of Mtb. Addressed in Project 2: Immune Determinants of the Course of Mtb
infection and Disease. 3) To define the host immune pathways that induce drug tolerance and identify potential
routes to therapeutic intervention. Addressed in Project 3: Minimizing in vivo Drug Tolerance Induction in TB. 4)
To define bacterial factors that contribute to the heterogeneous expression of drug tolerance and characterize
links with adverse treatment outcomes. Addressed in Project 4. Drug Tolerance, Bacterial Heterogeneity and
Adverse TB Treatment Outcomes."
10899445,"We propose to establish a Center of Excellence for Addiction Studies (CEAS) that will offer core services allowing
users to develop projects that will lead to new research in addiction. Addiction and relapse are characterized by
dysregulation of brain circuitry that involves diminished activity of brain reward circuits, increased responsiveness
of stress circuits and impaired functioning of executive cortical circuits. Neural changes are observed in the basal
ganglia, extended amygdala and prefrontal cortical regions and encompass a wide range of endogenous
neurotransmitters including dopamine, opioid peptides, endocannabinoids, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF),
dynorphin, glutamate and others. While chronic pain and addiction are different disorders, there is a remarkable
overlap between the influence of drugs of abuse and chronic pain on these circuits. Our faculty has broad
expertise in evaluation of mechanisms that underlie the maladaptations promoted by pain in these circuits. The
CEAS will be composed of four Cores and a Pilot Research Project. The Administrative Core will provide the
structural elements that will allow efficient functioning of the CEAS. The Genetic Targeting of Neural Circuits
Core will allow users to employ cutting edge genetic techniques including CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing,
chemogenetics and optogenetics to produce cell and circuit-specific manipulations to evaluate potential
mechanisms relevant to addiction. The Neuroanalytical Core will provide users with advanced methods of
measuring neurotransmitters with temporal resolution spanning milli-seconds to days and with spatial specificity
through advanced detection methods. The Behavioral Core will allow users to explore questions relevant to
addiction using behavioral assays that evaluate addictive processes including the influence of addictive drugs
on cognitive function. Investigators in the CEAS have worked together for many years and have shared and
individual research funding. Additionally, the CEAS will offer opportunities for other investigators at University
of Arizona as well as Arizona State University, Northern Arizona University, The University of New Mexico and
Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center at Lubbock and El Paso establishing a Southwestern region
engaged in addiction sciences. The CEAS will promote increased diversity in addiction research by recruiting
investigators and students from under-represented populations in neuroscience and addiction. The impact of the
CEAS will be to leverage established funding to develop new research on addiction research. In addition, the
impact of funds from the CEAS will be amplified by commitments of matching funds from the University of Arizona
and from a recently established Comprehensive Center of Pain and Addiction. The CEAS will provide key
services to its users that correspond with the goals of the NIDA to enhance addiction research with a goal of
development of therapies that can stem the opioid epidemic as well as impacting other substance abuse
disorders. The close collaboration between the Cores ensures high expertise in all areas of the addiction
research and will permit outcome measures emphasizing scientific rigor and reproducibility."
10841513,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and stroke remain the number
one cause of death in the U.S. for both men and women. CVDs affect Delawareans at a rate significantly above
the national average. CVDs are largely preventable, and related to risk factors prevalent in the state and region
such as poor diet, obesity, physical inactivity, and other modifiable behaviors. In addition to these risk factors,
increasing age and the presence of other chronic conditions significantly raise the risk for cardiovascular events
and death. These chronic conditions are common in the State of Delaware and indeed the nation.
Ideal cardiovascular health is defined as the absence of clinically manifest CVD, along with optimal levels of
blood pressure, cholesterol, blood glucose, and body weight. In addition, ideal cardiovascular health is
associated with healthy behaviors such as regular physical activity, lack of smoking, and healthy eating patterns.
It is well established that unhealthy cardiovascular behaviors can result in structural and/or functional vascular
changes, causing target organ impairment and damage. More mechanistic information is needed to combat
CVDs, and novel interventions need to be tested to improve cardiovascular health and overall wellbeing.
The goal of the University of Delaware Center of Biomedical Research Excellence in Cardiovascular Health is to
continue to support multidisciplinary research aimed toward understanding the mechanisms underlying the
causes and consequences of poor cardiovascular health and/or function, and developing effective interventions
for these conditions. In Phase I, the center successfully developed the independent research careers of a cohort
of investigators. We will foster the research careers of four new cardiovascular-focused investigators during
Phase II. These investigators will be supported by a comprehensive mentoring and career development program,
as well as infrastructure through the COBRE Research Core. These core resources along with a pilot program
and new faculty hires will position the center for longer term sustainability."
11089689,"Driving scientific questions that will be addressed by engaging with the CFDE and why it has not
yet been feasible
The Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program (1) collected massive data
from human cells perturbed by thousands of single small molecules as well as knockouts, knockdowns,
and over-expression of single genes. The diverse collections of perturbed human cells (n>50) were profiled
before and after the perturbations with an array of omics assays that include transcriptomics, proteomics,
epigenomics, cell viability, and imaging at different time points and where the small molecules were applied
in different concentrations. Altogether, over 2 million signatures are expected to be produced and provided
as a resource for the community for query and reuse at the time when the LINCS program officially ends
(6/2020). Such a resource can be used for limitless applications, for example, to study molecular
mechanisms of disease, repurpose existing drugs, predict side effects and indications for pre-clinical small
molecules, associate small molecules with the targets that they likely affect directly and indirectly,
reconstruct cell signaling and gene regulatory networks, understand the global space of all possible cellular
states in response to all possible perturbations of all human cells, and many more applications and use
cases. This utilization of LINCS resources is already happening but can be significantly enhanced via
continued efforts led by the LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) through interactions
with the CFDE and other CF DCCs in the next 3 years.
So far, the ~400 publications produced by the LINCS consortium have been cited by ~6,000 other papers,
demonstrating the high impact of the program on the research community. In particular, the computational
resources developed by the LINCS DCIC have been very successful. These tools and databases were
already visited by >1 million unique users, with currently ~30,000 unique users per month (based on Google
Analytics). These strong usage statistics demonstrate the value of LINCS resources and their potential for
making long-lasting impact on drug discovery, and the biomedical research community in general. The
LINCS DCIC developed web-based resources to enable the federated access, intuitive querying, and
integrative analysis and visualization of the LINCS data combined with other relevant data. To achieve this
the LINCS DCIC also processed many additional external data types from other relevant resources to be
integrated with LINCS data including data from other Common Fund programs such as GTEx, Epigenomics
Roadmap, and IMPC. However, such data integration efforts were achieved with little consideration of
community standards to ensure their long term findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability
(FAIR) (2). Our involvement with the NIH Data Commons Pilot Project Consortium (DCPPC) and the
Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) taught us many lessons on how to better achieve data
harmonization via the adoption of community standards to achieve long term sustainability of LINCS
resources. Hence, by interacting with the CFDE, adhering to the requirements that the CFDE will establish,
we will be able to reprocess the LINCS data, and the other data we use to integrate with LINCS, with
transformations that will enable improved FAIRness, further enabling more complex use cases.
In addition, by interacting directly with other CF DCCs we will enable the direct integration of LINCS data
with other CF generated resources. Our plan is to develop an interactive web-based data visualization
component that will enable users to project RNA-seq samples (patients, single cells, or signatures) into a
lower dimensional space based on their transcriptomics data profiling. Such visualization will be linked to
the metadata describing each sample, as well as automatically identified clusters, enrichment analysis
results for each sample or cluster, and predictions of drugs and small molecules from the LINCS resource.
This interactive web-based data visualization component will enable, for example, assisting KidsFirst portal
users, including physicians, to prescribe the most appropriate therapeutics to the right subtype of patients,
as well as trace patients over time to monitor their response to treatment enable decision support for
changing treatment course early, if necessary.
Finally, by moving all LINCS resources into a cloud environment through STRIDES, we will ensure that
LINCS resources are archived for the long term ensuring maximal reuse and enabling applications that are
currently not even imagined or possible."
10904806,"OVERALL â ABSTRACT
The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Cancer Center is a preeminent institute for basic cancer research.
More than 50 years ago, strategically focused efforts investigated the genetics of human cancer, laying the
foundation for multiple breakthroughs today. As a result, researchers in the CSHL Cancer Center have made
discoveries about how tumors initiate and progress, and they have produced novel tools, approaches, and
cancer models that are used around the world.
Over the last five years, the leadership of the CSHL Cancer Center transitioned smoothly, with David Tuveson
assuming the role of Center Director. Tuveson substantially expanded the Cancer Center leadership team,
reorganized the Programs and Shared Resources, and added new research infrastructure to support new
initiatives and maintain the highly collaborative and integrated research in the Center. The CSHL Cancer Center
now has 43 full members, who are divided into three research programs: Cancer Genetics and Genomics;
Gene Regulation and Inheritance; and Cellular Communication in Cancer. The research in these Programs
is supported by 10 Shared Resources, which provide access to cutting-edge technologies and expertise.
This transition has propelled the Cancer Centerâs research excellence. Broadly, the Cancer Center focuses on
three major themes: defining the basic molecular mechanisms underpinning cancer development and
progression; determining the features of neoplastic and stromal cellular heterogeneity that drive tumorigenesis;
and developing novel experimental and computational technologies to assist cancer diagnosis and therapy.
Center members published 408 cancer-relevant research papers during this funding cycle, with 41% in journals
with an impact factor greater than 10. Cancer Center members were recognized for their significant contributions
to science with 43 highly competitive national and international awards during this funding period. The Cancer
Center continues to be highly collaborative, with 27% of publications representing a collaboration between at
least two Center members. And finally, to support these efforts, members have obtained $11.8 million dollars in
cancer-relevant, peer-reviewed funding.
In the next funding period, the Cancer Center will continue to make foundational discoveries about cancer using
basic research. At the same time, the Cancer Center is committed to increasing links to cancer patients and
patient-derived models to facilitate an extension to human biology and clinical translation. Funds from the Cancer
Center Support Grant will support the Cancer Center Leadership, Administration, Education and Training, the
Developmental Funds that enhance innovative science, and the Shared Resources that provide essential
technologies to advance our cancer research."
10879777,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The host inflammatory response is a double-edged sword that must vigorously defend against pathogens,
but also requires restraint to prevent unintended injury to the host. The Cytokine Storm Syndrome (CSS)
represents a state of unbridled inflammation that can be triggered by infections, including Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome-associated Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While evidence for dysregulated cytokine
responses exists for the SARS-CoV-2-associated CSS (S-CSS), the precise cell types and viral factors that
precipitate this response remain incompletely understood. Autophagy is a cytosol-to-lysosome degradative
pathway that has important functions in host immunity. We have recently shown that autophagy genes in myeloid
cells, preliminarily alveolar macrophages (aMÎ¦), confer protection in a murine model of CSS induced by
intravenous TNF. We hypothesize that host autophagy may also have a pleiotropic role in limiting the S-CSS.
We are motivated in this hypothesis since coronaviruses (CoVs) manipulate host autophagy-associated
membranes for their own replication via the nonstructural protein 6 (nsp6). This proposal for the NIH Director's
New Innovator Award will test the role of host autophagy and a viral antagonist in the triggering of S-CSS using
both established and innovative methods. The project will utilize a model for SARS-CoV-2 infection in which the
human ACE2 receptor (encoded by hAce2) is delivered to mouse lungs via adenovirus (AdV) vector. Additionally,
we will determine the role of aMÎ¦-specific host pathways by utilizing mice deficient for GM-CSF signaling and
devoid of aMÎ¦ (Csf2rb-/-), that are durably restored with aMÎ¦ by a single intranasal instillation of progenitor cells
in neonates. The role of SARS-CoV-2 nsp6 in viral pathogenesis will be determined with recombinant viruses
deleted for this factor or with naturally occurring point mutations hypothesized to facilitate infection. Moreover,
we will develop an AdV-hAce2 vector system expressing sgRNAs to edit genes directly in susceptible respiratory
cells in Cas9-transgenic recipient mice. We will generate pooled AdV sgRNA libraries via this method for in vivo
screening approaches that may identify host pathways important for regulating infection not otherwise
recapitulated by in vitro approaches. Further, we will reconstitute Csf2rb-/- mice with aMÎ¦ cell progenitors
containing pooled CRISPR libraries to identify host genes important for not only the aMÎ¦ response to SARS-
CoV-2 but also for fundamental aspects of aMÎ¦ niche development. These studies have the potential to identify
new areas for the development of host- and viral-directed therapies (e.g., the autophagy pathway and nsp6,
respectively). The robust and versatile in vivo platforms established for functional genomic studies of a tissue
site critical for the proximal response to SARS-CoV-2 have broader implications for the study of complex cell
populations in diverse biological processes."
11087940,"The accessibility of information relevant for interpreting genetic variants. As the pace of WGS
accelerates, the interpretation of the 99% of variants revealed by WGS that are non-coding is of
increasing importance. High-volume âomicâ profiling datasets generated by Common Fund projects and
derived information about specific variants and regulatory elements have great potential to inform the
interpretation of such non-coding variants. NIH CF Roadmap Epigenome, GTEx and CF Extracellular
RNA Communication Consortium (CF ERCC) already generate publicly shareable information about the
impact of individual regulatory variants in the form of allele-specific DNA methylation, chromatin states,
transcription factor binding, phased allelic transcription, e/sQTL information, and transcription status of
non-coding and coding variants. More detailed information that may help evaluate functional effects of a
variant in specific haplotype and tissue contexts can be gleaned from privacy-protected multi-omic
profiles of biosamples containing the variant. Both the summary-level and the protected variant
information is currently fragmented, poorly accessible and lacks interoperability.
The scope of this project. By
leveraging resources from the CF ERCC
and NHGRI ClinGen projects (Table 1),
we will unlock the value of variant
information across Common Fund
projects. One immediate aim will be to
improve FAIRness of Extracellular RNA
Communication Consortium (ERCC)
data and make it accessible via the
CFDE Data Portal. Additional two aims
cut across CF projects and involve the
development of infrastructure for
âgenomic indexingâ, i.e., for aggregating
variant information across CF projects
and for making the information FAIR and useful in both the research and clinical use cases. The
information will be aggregated at the summary-level that does not compromise identity of participants and
also at the more detailed level that will be protected and will involve authorized access. We will initiate the
cross-CF integration with variant information from Roadmap Epigenome, GTEx, and the Extracellular
RNA Communication Consortium (ERCC) projects. In collaboration with GTEx (see letter from Dr. Kristin
Ardlie, GTEx PI), we will make the aggregated variant information accessible via web UIs and APIs
hosted at the CFDE Data Portal.
The research and clinical diagnostic use cases. The research use cases will come from the NIH
Common Fund Gabriella Miller Kids First-KOMP2 (see letters from Dr. Bruce Gelb, KidsFirst-KOMP2 PI,
and Dr. Sharon Plon, KidsFirst PI). The clinical diagnostic use cases will come from the NHGRI Clinical
Genome Resource (ClinGen) project (see letter from Dr. Sharon Plon, ClinGen PI). In collaboration with
these projects, we will develop data models, data flows, system designs, and will participate in the
validation of the systems. This collaboration between Drs. Gelb, Plon and Milosavljevic will build on
several years of their previous collaboration within ClinGen where Dr. Gelb co-chairs the RASopathy
Expert Panel and Drs. Plon and Milosavljevic serve on the ClinGen Steering Committee.
FOA Areas addressed. As described below, our project will partner with CFDE-CC in the following two
Areas listed in the FOA: Area 1 (Enabling access to, and computation across, multiple data sets in a
cloud environment â addressed in this Section) and Area 3 (Enabling end-users to compute on data in the
cloud â addressed in Section 2)."
11086411,"The Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) consortium has two major goals: First, consolidate disparate
protein- and disease-centric data types from multiple sources, integrate and harmonize them, then make them
readily available to the public; Second, adapt and scale existing technologies to unveil the function of selected
understudied members of the G-protein coupled receptor, ion channel and protein kinase families. Within the
IDG, the Knowledge Management Center (IDG-KMC) integrates data from a wide range of chemical, biological
and clinical resources, and has developed platforms that can be used to navigate understudied proteins (the
âdark genomeâ), and their potential contribution to specific pathologies. Specifically, the IDG KMC is creating
automated workflows to capture relevant public data for the entire proteome including manual annotations for
the IDG list, covering five major areas: genotype, phenotype, expression, structure & function, and interactions
& pathways. The IDG KMC designs, develops, implements, and updates the Target Central Repository Database
(TCRD), a protein knowledgebase. The IDG KMC also expands, improves, and maintains Pharos, the TCRD
portal, with support for automated data summaries, and active community feedback. Both TCRD and Pharos
already integrate data from three Common Fund projects: GTEx, IMPC/KOMP and LINCS. The IDG KMC
consolidates all the data generated by the Data and Resource Generation Centers (DRGCs), improving these
data findability, accessibility, interoperability, reusability (FAIRness) and serving these data on the Pharos portal.
The IDG program interface with the CFDE will enable hypothesis generation about novel drug targets for complex
diseases. Many other Common Fund (CF) programs produce data about genetic variants and differentially
expressed genes and proteins in the context of many complex human diseases. These genes in many cases do
not have much information about them. For example, the CF program Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN)
identifies mutations in genes associated with undiagnosed diseases. The IDG-KMC has information from
empirical evidence and from computational predictions about the function of these genes, which are commonly
under-studied. Hence, data from the IDG-KMC can enrich the CFDE users who examine datasets that list genes
and proteins. Several IDG resources provide gene landing pages that provide unique information about genes.
These landing pages can be improved regarding FAIRness and can become a resource for the CFDE. In
addition, data collected by the DRGCs and by the R03 IDG awardees can enrich the content of the CFDE portal. In
particular, results from the R03 projects (Fig. 1) are currently not evaluated or stored in one place and are at risk
of becoming lost. The CFDE engagement will ensure that data from this investment remains available long term."

This Asthma and Allergic Disease Cooperative Research Center (AADCRC) continues its focus on the
mechanistic basis of respiratory tract type 2 immunopathology (T2I), particularly in aspirin-exacerbated
respiratory disease (AERD), a distinctive clinical syndrome that accounts for a disproportionate percentage of
individuals with severe asthma and recurrent chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP). In the
current period of support, we discovered marked epigenetically imprinted abnormailites in epithelial basal cell
(BC) function and differentiation underlying CRSwNP and AERD, some of which are driven by strong,
persistent signaling through the interleukin 4 receptor alpha (IL-4RÎ±) and some by altered Wnt/Notch signaling.
We identified dramatic hyperplasia of mast cells (MCs) in CRSwNP tissue, especially from individuals with
AERD, driven in part by a novel, transcriptionally and cytofluorographically distinct MC population with a high
rate of proliferation. We now have strong evidence that MC-stromal interactions drive many pathophysiologic
features of respiratory T2I, and that these interactions are regulated by synergistic inputs from IL-4RÎ± and IL-
33/ST2 signaling axes. A tightly interactive team of accomplished investigators with complementary skills will
apply cellular, molecular, and whole animal strategies, combined with a proof-of-concept clincal trial to
determine the mechanistic basis for these findings, their relevance to disease pathophysiology, and their
amenability to therapy. Project 1 (J. Boyce, PI) focuses on the the developmental origins of respiratory tract
MCs, how their interactions with stromal cells dictate MC development and function and are altered by IL-4RÎ±
signaling, and how MCs drive altered stromal cell function through a feed-forward loop involving IL-6 and
leukemia inhibitory factor. Project 2 (N. Barrett, PI) focuses on the mechanisms by which epigenetic
reprogramming of BCs combines with IL-4RÎ± signaling to drive BC dysplasia and sensecence as a disease-
causing mechanism. Project 3 (T. Laidlaw, PI) will compare the efficacy of IL-4RÎ± blockade with IL-33
blockade in a proof of mechanism placebo controlled trial, focusing on restoration of BC function and
suppression of MC hyperplasia and activation. The Projects are supported by respective Cores for
Adminstration (Core A), and Integrative Genomics (Core B)."
10913366,"Project Summary â Overall
This Wistar/UPenn Skin SPORE represents a highly successful and longstanding collaboration. Immune
checkpoint inhibition has revolutionized melanoma therapy to the point where every high-risk melanoma patient
will be treated at some point with these agents. However, many major questions remain on how best to use
these immune therapeutics. Project 1 will address the unmet need to find an effective biomarker to select
patients for single agent versus combination immunotherapy. Many patients start treatment with ipilimumab and
nivolumab, when they may have responded to anti-PD-1 antibody (Ab) alone, exposing these patients
unnecessarily to the toxicity of combination checkpoint inhibition. Project 1 builds on a fundamental discovery
made through our Developmental Research Program (DRP) that exosomal PD-L1 is an immunosuppressive
factor secreted by melanomas. We propose rigorous clinical utility studies designed to demonstrate this blood-
based measurement as a highly sensitive and specific predictive biomarker for anti-PD-1 antibody (Ab)-based
therapy. Project 2 will address a second unmet need for a safer and effective combination regimen that promises
to be effective in anti-PD-1 Ab refractory patients. Based on extensive preclinical data and a new molecular
target in the autophagy pathway, we have developed a clinical trial of combined anti-PD1 Ab and autophagy
inhibition, a new strategy for reprogramming tumor-associated macrophages to enhance the efficacy of T cell
killing. Project 3 fills a major gap in the treatment of early disease by conducting a clinical trial with anti-PD1 Ab
in Stage IIB/C melanoma patients. Besides in-depth characterization of the immune response, the Projectâs
preclinical studies will lead to new strategies for enhancing the immune stimulatory capacity of dendritic cells in
the tumor microenvironment. These three highly translational Projects are supported by longstanding Cores that
have a proven track record of adapting to the rapidly changing needs of melanoma and non-melanoma skin
cancer researchers. Each Project was chosen by the current SPORE leadership for its potential for significance,
impact and innovation. Together, they have the potential to advance therapeutically exploitable biological insights
into new, clinically important therapies of patients with melanoma. Funding from the SPORE has provided us
with important advantages, including a mature, collective, translational mindset, an efficiently functioning tumor
bank, and a highly evolved framework of collaboration between The Wistar Institute and UPenn. The SPORE
has allowed us to bolster horizontal and vertical collaborations with academic and industry partners throughout
the world. The Career Enhancement Program and DRP have enabled transition to new leadership, have formed
the three Projects proposed, and have allowed our research to reach into other cancers of the skin including
SCC, CTCL and Merkel Cell carcinoma. These programs will continue to be supported robustly by strong
institutional support from both Wistar and UPenn. Funding of this SPORE will bring new advances from the
bench to the bedside and fulfill our overall mission of improving survival for skin cancer patients."

Brain tumors are the most common pediatric solid malignancies, and the leading cause of cancer-related death
in children. The long-term goal of this Program Project is to improve understanding and treatment of diffuse
intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) and medulloblastoma (MB), which cause devastating mortality and morbidity in
children. Over the last funding period, P01 investigators Baker, Roussel and Gilbertson demonstrated important
contributions of epigenetic dysregulation in DIPG and MB, a role for pediatric brain tumor mutations in stress
response, and therapeutic vulnerabilities in MB subtypes. P01 Investigator Northcott joins as a new Project
leader with a proposal based on the discovery of a new MB cancer predisposition gene. This highly interactive
team proposes an integrated series of experiments to leverage recent progress and the most advanced
techniques to investigate aberrant cell fate/cell state regulation, to determine the contribution of epigenome,
transcriptome and proteome dysregulation to disrupted development and tumorigenesis, and to identify
developmental and epigenetic functional dependencies and test therapeutic vulnerabilities of pediatric hindbrain
tumors. In Project 1, S Baker is focused on the contribution of H3K27M mutations in disrupted development,
tumor initiation and spatiotemporal selectivity of tumorigenesis, and how cooperative contributions of ACVR1
and PI3K/mTOR pathways influence heterogeneity of therapeutic response to selective inhibitors. In Project 2,
M Roussel investigates the role of the methyltransferase SMYD3, and tests drug combinations that enhance
efficacy of methyltransferase inhibitors in the Group 3 MB subtype. In Project 3, P Northcott evaluates how loss
of function in ELP1 drives MB predisposition, perturbs regulation of translation elongation, and cooperates with
other mutations in the SHH-MB subtype. In Project 4, R Gilbertson investigates how DDX3X mutations disrupt
cell fate decisions, transcription and translation regulation, and investigates novel therapies to exploit the
defective blood-brain-barrier in WNT-MB. All four projects rely on the outstanding expertise in Core B, where all
next-generation sequence data will be analyzed including integrated cross-comparison of data from multiple
projects, and rigorous biostatistical approaches will be applied for experimental design and interpretation. Core
C is integral to all projects and will provide expert neuropathological review of all tumor models studied in the
program to assess their similarity and relevance to primary human disease and will assist with phenotype
analyses and optimizing immunohistochemical analyses. The collective efforts of the Program will impact our
understanding of disease pathogenesis of DIPG and MB, extend beyond pediatric hindbrain tumors, to enhance
understanding of how aberrant regulation of the epigenome, transcriptome and proteome disrupt normal
development and contribute to cancer. Our success is guaranteed by our strong track record of productive
collaborations, the unique resources and the outstanding Cores to facilitate the acquisition, exchange, and
integration of data."
10910866,"PROJECT SUMMARY_OVERALL
Recovery from viral pneumonia is a clinically important yet understudied process. Severe influenza A virus and
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 cause severe viral pneumonia, which damages the lower
respiratory tract to induce acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Most ARDS deaths occur days-to-weeks
after ARDS onsetâa time when patients are recovering from the inciting insult, yet studies in murine models
typically focus on the early development of acute lung injury and death from overwhelming infection. Other than
avoidance of additional lung injury, via low tidal volume ventilation and a handful of other supportive therapies,
there are no specific therapies for patients with viral pneumonia induced ARDS. A central hypothesis of this
PPG is that the persistence of respiratory failure and the development of multiple organ dysfunction in patients
with ARDS is a consequence of the failure of normal mechanisms of inflammation resolution and lung tissue
repair. This hypothesis is clinically supported by a recent analysis of patients enrolled in the ARDSnet where a
âhyperinflammatoryâ endotype of ARDS patients was associated with worse clinical outcomes, including death.
We propose to investigate the process of recovery from viral pneumonia with a focus on mechanisms
that promote resolution of lung inflammation and healthy repair of lung damage. The PPG investigators
will test this central hypothesis through a highly integrated and innovative set of experiments by focusing on four
Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1. To determine whether vimentin regulates persistent inflammation during recovery from severe
influenza A virusâinduced pneumonia by promoting a pro-inflammatory phenotype in monocyte-derived alveolar
macrophages and by limiting the pro-repair capacity of regulatory T cells.
Specific Aim 2. To determine whether mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I or III, and lactate
production, drives persistent NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent inflammation during recovery from severe
influenza A virusâinduced pneumonia.
Specific Aim 3. To determine whether persistent activation of LUBAC-mediated NF-kB signaling in the lung
epithelium drives macrophage activation and inhibits lung repair following viral pneumonia.
Specific Aim 4. To determine whether DNA methyltransferase activity and UHRF1 induce DNA
hypermethylation in Treg cells during aging to impair Treg cell reparative function following severe viral
pneumonia in older hosts."

based and patient and caregiver (dyadic) cohorts. Using state of the art clinical informatics and statistical
methods, these rich data should permit an exploration of the molecular heterogeneity of ADRD and uncover
novel biology and drug targets, treatment approaches. Finally we will collaborate, share data/samples and
expertise with other institutions in Texas and around the world, especially other ADRC Centers, the NACC,
NCRAD, NIAGADS. We will achieve these aims through creation of six required Cores and one component:
Administrative, Clinical, Data Management and Statistical, Neuropathology, Outreach, Recruitment and
Engagement, Biomarker Cores and the Research Education Component. In addition, we propose three
Optional Cores: Population Neuroscience, Imaging and Genetics and Multiomics Cores. The STAC will serve
as a national resource for disruptive, transformative and innovative research and the design, development,
testing and implementation of practical strategies to diminish the burden of AD in Hispanics."
10849663,"OVERALL CORE CENTER PROJECT SUMMARY
Digital therapeutics that deliver science-based, behavior change interventions targeting substance use
disorders (SUDs) and related issues (including HIV risk behavior and mental health disorders) can markedly
improve access to care, quality of care, and treatment outcomes, while reducing costs, for a wide array of
audiences in diverse settings. Our interdisciplinary group received a P30 âCenter of Excellenceâ grant from
NIDA 9 years ago to launch a new research center (the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health [CTBH]).
CTBH has led the field in the development, empirical testing, and implementation of digital therapeutics
targeting SUDs and related issues. In this renewal application, we propose to build on this work and grow
activities to address the most timely and significant research priorities for the field to: (1) enhance our
collaborative work with a wide array of scientific, clinical, industry, and governmental partners to scale access
to science-based digital therapeutics across the U.S. and beyond; (2) expand activities to link CTBHâs
innovative research in digital health measurement to inform personalized digital therapeutics; (3) accelerate
research and mentorship on transdiagnostic digital treatments for substance use and co-occurring mental and
physical health conditions (CODs); (4) expand research and resources on digital health ethics and (5) broaden
the diversity and inclusiveness of digital health researchers by increasing mentorship and representativeness
of underrepresented minorities in digital health research. The Overall Aim of the P30 Center is: To integrate
expertise across multiple disciplines and provide an infrastructure to enhance the quality, pace of achievement,
and impact of innovative scientific research that combines science-based behavior change interventions with
state-of-the-science technologies to create, evaluate, and disseminate digital therapeutics targeting SUDs and
co-occurring disorders (CODs). CTBH will achieve this Aim via 5 Cores: (1) The Treatment Development and
Evaluation Core will provide resources and training to enhance the quality, efficiency, and impact of research
and support mechanisms to accelerate the state-of-the science of digital health assessments and therapeutics
(2) The Dissemination and Implementation Core will disseminate research methods and findings and advance
a scientific understanding of successful implementation of digital therapeutics in diverse settings, (3) The
Emerging Technologies and Data Analytics Core will enhance education and research on the application of
emerging technologies and data analytics to digital therapeutics and support shared resources to enhance the
pace of development, and potency of, digital therapeutics, (4) The Pilot Core will support the development of
new areas of research that could progress to larger-scale testing via external funding after the pilot phase, and
(5) The Administrative Core will provide programmatic leadership that ensures successful coordination of
activities across Cores and an infrastructure to enhance synergy among our interdisciplinary team."
10828774,"SUMMARY
The importance of biomarkers in clinical practice and regulatory science is difficult to overstate. The ultimate
goal for clinical care of the future is to determine the most appropriate therapy for each patientâs unique version
of a particular disease. This concept of precision medicine has been identified as a national priority in the USA,
leading to a need for biomarkers that can provide objective and reproducible information. In addition, regulatory
science for the approval of new qualified drugs and medical technologies has an urgent need for qualified
biomarkers to report on the success or failure of these drugs and technologies. Imaging biomarkers, providing
in situ âbiopsiesâ, have the potential to provide such specific information and, ultimately, to improve routine
clinical care and speed up development of new treatments. The overall goal of this Resource therefore is to
develop novel noninvasive MRI candidate biomarkers that can ultimately be used for: (i) personalized
assessment of patients for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring; (ii) monitoring of the development
of new medical technologies and drugs, i.e. for better guiding of clinical trials. The significance of our proposed
developments lies in providing the fundamental design and initial testing (i.e. not clinical trials itself) of new MRI
candidate biomarkers with the potential to provide surrogate quantitative imaging endpoints that are as close
as possible to clinical endpoints. As such, this Resource will focus on designing, calibrating and standardizing
new magnetic resonance (MR) technologies to provide reliable measures across sessions, scanners, and
raters. This technology will then be disseminated for larger scale patient studies to allow clinical validation.
 The MRI Resource for Physiologic, Metabolic and Anatomic Biomarkers is an interdepartmental and
interdisciplinary consortium combining facilities and expertise of the F.M. Kirby Research Center at Kennedy
Krieger Institute (KKI), the Department of Radiology at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) School of Medicine, the
Center for Imaging Science at the JHU Whiting School of Engineering, and the Department of Biostatistics at
the JHU Bloomberg School of Public Health. We propose 4 TRD projects, 3 on MR acquisition approaches and
one bringing them together with advanced multi-scale data analysis methods that include machine learning. To
assure a proper choice of technologies, we will interact closely with a group of clinical and research experts in
a push-pull relationship through collaborative projects (CPs) that focus on brain diseases, disorders, and
injuries that have a need for new quantitative MR technology to better and noninvasively assess them. These
include anemia/ischemia and related white matter hyperintensity lesions (CPs 1,5), aging, cerebrovascular
disease, and dementia (CPs 2,7,10), traumatic brain injury (CP4), glymphatic function (CP6), pain (CP8) and
addiction (CP9). As an initial testbed for our methods, we also have a group of service projects (SPs) to which
we will provide both data acquisition methods and data analysis software. Finally, we will train investigators in
their use and disseminate methods nationwide and to MRI manufacturers for even broader application."
10930035,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The goal of this application is to further develop an integrated, multidisciplinary and translational Center
for Childhood Obesity Prevention (CCOP) that will be sustained within the Arkansas Childrenâs
Research Institute. Childhood obesity is a national public health threat that is disproportionately worse in
Arkansas. In the United States, nearly 1 in 5 school age youth have obesity (1). Among school-age youth in
Arkansas, 23% have obesity and 17% are classified as overweight (2). Further, the prevalence of hypertension
(4-6), and other obesity-related co-morbidities, have increased dramatically over the last two decades.
Additionally, obesity and obesity-promoting behaviors are also linked to a variety of cancers (16). To address
this complex problem, a group of emerging scientists recruited in Phase 1 will continue to build their
collaborative work in elucidating causes, and testing interventions, to stop the rise and ultimately reduce the
prevalence of child overweight and obesity and corresponding comorbidities.
 In order to establish a broad-based, multi-disciplinary disease prevention center, rooted in a team
science approach, projects span the full translational continuum, bringing together research in complex
disease origins, epidemiology, and social systems. Ongoing recruitment of additional research project leaders
and pilot study investigators will continue to build a critical mass of scientists focused on building the base of
evidence for strategies to address the childhood obesity crisis and improve child health.
 Specific Aim 1: Further enhance the research infrastructure established in Phase 1 to support
the Center. Critical institutional support and strong collaborations with multiple key institutional and community
partners have been established, and will continue to be enhanced, to provide junior investigatorsâ access to
state-of-the-art biomedical research facilities and resources to pursue inquiry focused on the theme of
childhood obesity prevention.
 Specific Aim 2: Continue to build on the successful faculty development program implemented
in Phase 1. The career development training program established in Phase 1 in partnership with the UAMS
CTSAâs Research Fundamentals program will continue to be strengthened. A âbest practicesâ senior mentoring
program combines a Senior Mentor Rights and Responsibilities contract with guidance from a Senior
Mentoring Leadership Team approach.
 Specific Aim 3: Ensure robust operations and pathway to sustainability for the Center for
Childhood Obesity Prevention. Comprehensive operational procedures for managing the Centerâs fiscal,
regulatory, project development, and research core viability processes were established, and will continue to
be strengthened. Significant institutional investment has been secured, and will be leveraged to ensure long
term sustainability of the Center."
10824207,"Anticipated Impacts on Veteran's Health: The availability of VHA ED care has expanded rapidly over the past
decade. VHA Emergency Department (ED) often serves as a first stop for Veterans who are experiencing
acute problems related to hazardous alcohol use and mental health problems. Many Veterans seen in VHA
EDs report hazardous drinking that is either tied directly to their presenting problem or complicates the care of
medical and/or psychiatric symptoms. Hazardous drinking is directly related to high volume and high morbidity
problems in Veterans, including PTSD, suicidality and homelessness. Providing alcohol brief interventions in
this fast-paced environment can be difficult due to competing staff time demands. Expanding the role of peer
mentors used in the VHA to providing brief alcohol advice in the ED combined with post-ED continuing support
designed to reduce hazardous drinking and help Veterans engage in care has the potential to fill this gap in ED
care and improve outcomes for a vulnerable population. Project Background: Research indicates that a high
proportion of patients seen in EDs have hazardous or harmful alcohol use. Due to limited provider time to
screen for alcohol and deliver alcohol-related services in EDs, few individuals currently receive the needed
assistance to cut-back, stop drinking, and/or link to needed services following an ED visit. Single-session
alcohol brief interventions (BIs) alone are only modestly effective in the ED and thus more intensive, but
sustainable, interventions are needed to facilitate engagement to the most appropriate VHA resource (e.g.,
substance abuse treatment, homeless program case management, embedded mental health in primary care,
etc.). The VHA nationally has implemented the use of trained peer specialists in a number of areas. VHA EDs
have the opportunity to use peer specialists to conduct standardized alcohol brief interventions, provide
continuing support, and link Veterans to needed services. The widespread availability of peers within health
care teams provides a potential method to overcome barriers for connecting Veterans with hazardous/harmful
alcohol use to needed VHA services. Project Objectives: The objective of this proposed study is to conduct a
hybrid randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of an intervention starting in the ED with peer-
delivered brief alcohol advice (including a 6-session program of post-ED strengths-based peer mentorship)
compared to clinician-delivered brief advice in the ED only to facilitate reductions in hazardous drinking, and
linkage and engagement in primary and/or specialty care. Aim 1: Determine the efficacy of the ED Alcohol
Peer Mentor (APM) intervention compared to Clinical Brief Advice (CBA) on subsequent AUDIT scores,
including quantity/frequency of alcohol use, binge drinking, and alcohol consequences at 3-, 6-, and 12-months
post-baseline. Aim 2: Determine the impact of the APM intervention on linkage to primary and specialty alcohol
treatment services care, mental health symptoms and functioning at 3-, 6-, and 12-months post-baseline.
Project Methods: The proposed study will screen VA ED patients for hazardous drinking. Those screening
positive and who enroll in the study will be randomized to one of two conditions: 1) APM intervention (n=225),
and 2) CBA (n=225) comparison condition. All participants will receive written community resource information.
All individuals in the APM condition will receive peer support to reduce hazardous drinking, and those who
meet alcohol use disorder criteria will be coached by the peer and will assist in a warm handoff to addiction
treatment. Qualitative interviews with a subset of Veterans, peers, clinicians, and clinical leaders will assess
potential barriers and facilitators to the implementation of this approach in the VHA. Because the VHA ED is an
important portal for entry into the VA health care system, particularly for Veterans who are experiencing
hazardous or harmful drinking, the delivery of an efficacious alcohol peer-mentor intervention with minimal use
of staff resources could have a major public health impact."
10675427,"Project Summary / Abstract:
Liver transplantation is curative in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
However, the clinical need for organs greatly exceeds their availability. In addition, few patients
diagnosed with HCC are candidates for primary surgical resection, due to an insufficient future
liver remnant (FLR) in the presence of underlying liver disease. Portal vein embolization (PVE),
a technique known to induce FLR hypertrophy by redirecting portal flow, is relatively
contraindicated in cirrhosis due to concerns to induce liver failure and worsen pre-existent portal
hypertension following the procedure. We have recently demonstrated the potential efficacy of a
new paradigm to achieve locoregional HCC control while inducing FLR hypertrophy with lobar
infusion of 90Y impregnated glass beads (90Y radiation lobectomy [90Y-RL]). Although
preliminary data demonstrates the utility of this approach, the optimal dose strategy to induce
FLR hypertrophy while minimizing the risk of worsening liver function and portal hypertension is
unknown. Our proposed study investigates the underlying mechanisms of embolized liver
atrophy and FLR hypertrophy following 90Y-RL through improved dosimetry and advanced
quantitative MR imaging. Patients with unresectable HCC will be recruited at the time of referral
for 90Y-RL following review in our multidisciplinary HCC treatment conference. In Aim #1 we will
investigate the influence of proscribed radiation dose and glass bead embolic load on FLR
hypertrophy calculating actual parenchymal doses with the use of non-FDG PET/CT to visualize
glass bead distribution following 90Y-RL. The optimal dose/embolic load paradigm will be applied
in a prospective study of 64 subjects with unresectable HCC referred for 90Y-RL in Aim #2.
These subjects will undergo quantitative MR imaging, assessing changes in liver stiffness with
MR elastography, liver hemodynamics with non-contrast 4D flow MRI, and parenchymal
perfusion with accelerated time-resolved MR angiography before and at 1- and 3-months after
90Y-RL. Quantitative MRI derived biomarkers will be correlated with FLR hypertrophy and
trophic factors to delineate changes predictive of adequate FLR following 90Y-RL. Finally, we will
assess differences in recurrence-free survival 90Y-RL patients who underwent surgical resection
and those whose FLR deemed them candidates for surgical resection at presentation. This
project will deepen our understanding of the mechanisms leading to the liver atrophy-
hypertrophy complex following 90Y-RL endeavoring to make the procedure safer and more
effective. The results of this study will support a multicenter clinical trial evaluating the survival
of patients with unresectable HCC treated with 90Y-RL."
11162112,"This proposal outlines plans for the creation of K-CORE, a new core for SPARC that will provide
curation of SPARC datasets, knowledge management and services for the SPARC Knowledge
Graph. The latter is a semantic store that combines information on SPARC datasets annotated
according to the SPARC Minimal Information Standard (MIS) with functional and anatomical
topologically based connectivity knowledge for the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Included in
the ANS are the sympathetic, parasympathetic and enteric nervous systems, with reference to
sensory and motor pathways as necessary. Technology development in SPARC is provided by
the SPARC Data and Resource Center (DRC), currently comprising DAT-CORE, which provisions
the data platform, MAP-CORE, which develops 2 and 3D mapping tools and a map-based GUI,
and SIM-CORE which fields the simulation platform. To date, the curation and knowledge
management functions have been conducted under the purview of MAP-CORE, led by Dr. Peter
Hunter at the Auckland Bioinformatics Institute with a subcontract to UCSD. However, these
services are sufficiently broad and cross cutting that they should be managed through a separate
core. The K-CORE team has been providing curation and knowledge management services for
SPARC since 2018 and thus are deeply familiar with the project."

This COBRE Phase 2 application proposes continued support of the UND Center for Excellence in Host-
Pathogen interaction (HPI). The long-term goal of this center is to develop a deeper understanding of host
responses to viral, bacterial and parasitic insults leading to acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. The vision
of this Center is to continue to inspire interest in the study of host-microbe interaction and perform paradigm-
shifting science that supports the notion that disease development is an interplay of the interaction between a
susceptible host, foreign insult and conducive microenvironment. In Phase 1 this center made significant
progress by expanding the number of investigators studying various aspects of infectious and inflammatory
diseases (from the initial group of 9 labs to now 18 labs). Since the funding of Phase 1 in 2016, this core group
of COBRE investigators has made significant contributions to the field by producing 169 publications,
$23,617,386 in extramural funding, and 74 speaking engagements (local, national and international). With the
project leader graduation success rate of 80% (4 out 6 investigators graduated with R01 funding) in Phase 1,
this Center will continue to promote research on host-microbe interaction by: 1) bringing together four young
investigators working cohesively in an integrative, collaborative, and multidisciplinary manner on research
encompassing extremely timely COVID-19 infection, intestinal dysbiosis in food allergy, gastrointestinal parasitic
infection, and viral interaction with respiratory epithelium; 2) enhance the innovative research capabilities of the
Center by supporting 3 existing Phase 1 Core facilities; 3) establishing a new Computational Data Analysis Core
to meet the emerging requirements of COBRE investigators; and 4) attract new investigators to the group by
supporting pilot grant mechanisms. The ultimate goal is to transition the HPI COBRE to a sustainable, well-
organized academic center which will serve as a conduit for increased interaction between investigators from
diverse backgrounds with a thematic interest in pursuing research on various aspects of host-microbe
interactions."
11130215,"Updated Abstract Text: Perhaps the biggest challenge in designing and implementing a data management & sharing strategy for HEAL is its broad range of programs, projects and types of data being collected. While individual programs or projects are supported by Data Coordinating Centers (DCCs) and Data Management Centers (DMCs), broad sharing of HEAL data will require a platform that can link together the DMCs and extend their reach while working smoothly with them. The range of HEAL data types is extensive, spanning multiple measurement modalities (e.g., clinical data, bioassays, wearables and self-report data) as well as varying in size and complexity. In addition, the range of scientific disciplines represented not only among the HEAL investigators but among other researchers likely to use HEAL data, together with the range of scientific questions that might be pursued, also have implications for how data should be organized, documented and made accessible to maximize their scientific value. Specifically, a single monolithic system is likely to fail, or at least be sub-optimal. At the same time, asking all programs or projects to build their own systems conforming to a set of common requirements would be both expensive and unsustainable. We propose to build and maintain a HEAL Platform that will interoperate with the DMCs to enable discoverability and access of HEAL data stored in the DMCs or other repositories. The platform will allow search and query of the HEAL metadata, and selected data, within and across studies, and provide access to a secure, scalable computing environment to conduct independent analysis on HEAL data along with the userâs own data."
10895344,"Project Summary
Epithelial cells are the first line of defense as they interface with the environment and initiate the response to
environmental triggers. Our AADCRC is focused on elucidating the mechanisms by which epithelial cells
contribute to the pathogenesis of allergic disorders. We found that while some epithelial genes are associated
with tissue-specific disease, others are associated with specific combinations of disease and may contribute to
disease progression from one end-organ to another. It is known that allergic disorders show substantial lifetime
comorbidity. The âatopic marchâ concept has served as a guiding principle in our field, however, it has become
evident that only very small proportion of children follow the traditional atopic march. While early-life AD remains
a major risk factor for the development of atopic disease, there is significant heterogeneity in presentation of the
atopic march including the timing and organ(s) affected. The atopic march needs to be revised to include this
heterogeneity and incorporate the pathogenesis of the various combinations of the atopic march. Our Center is
designed to help fill this critical knowledge gap. In the last cycle of funding, we built the first US early-life
prospective longitudinal cohort of AD (Mechanisms of Progression of Atopic Dermatitis to Asthma in Children,
MPAACH) and conducted mechanistic studies to identify epithelial pathways that promote allergic inflammation
and disease. Our collective preliminary data implicate novel epithelial pathways as key drivers of allergic disease
persistence in a given tissue as well as progression from one tissue to another. Herein, we will determine how
these pathways act to promote the development, persistence, and progression of allergic and inflammatory
diseases. Further, the atopic march needs to be revised to include non-White children. The vast majority of
studies that served as the foundation for the atopic march principle were conducted in White populations, and
our data reveal marked racial differences in the current atopic march concept. MPAACH is comprised of 65%
Black children and was designed to help fill this critical need. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that
homeostatic mechanisms at epithelial surfaces, upon dysregulation, promote allergic inflammation and
contribute to the persistence, progression, remission and resolution of allergic disease(s). This hypothesis will
be tested by three integrated and synergistic projects focused on epithelial cell biology that combine
epidemiologic, basic, and translational research approaches to study multiple end-organs involved in allergic
responses. Integration of data across projects by the Data Integration and Analysis Core (DIAC) will provide
novel insights into a key unanswered question in the allergy field: Why is allergic inflammation restricted to one
tissue in some cases, while it progresses to involve additional tissues in other individuals? Identification of the
epithelial genes/pathways that predispose individuals to specific or shared allergic disorders will empower the
search for therapeutics aimed specifically at the epithelial surface, and the development of treatment and
prevention strategies optimized for allergic disorders alone and/or in combination."

The vision science research program at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) has been supported by one of
the longest-running core grants from the National Eye Institute (NEI). The overarching goal of the Center Core
Grant for Vision Research is to support, strengthen and expand basic and translational vision science research
at UIC. A major advantage of the Center Core Grant is that it facilitates inter-disciplinary and inter-departmental
scientific interactions and collaborations among members of the Vision Science Research Community (VSRC).
Current VSRC investigators hold a total of 25 NEI-funded research grants, of which, 16 are qualifying R01s.
The Center Core Grant resources have significantly impacted performance of pioneering research in wide-
ranging and clinically-relevant areas. These resources have enhanced research capabilities and productivity of
individual investigators, created an environment conducive to resource-sharing and collaborative scientific
interactions, assisted new investigators to develop research projects, and aided established NEI R01-funded
investigators to pursue research in emerging fields. This renewal Center Core Grant application responds to
the evolving research needs of participating investigators and requests funding to support 4 resource Cores:
Cellular and Molecular Biology Core, Imaging and Image Analysis Core, Animal Services Core, and
Translational Core for Therapeutic and Diagnostic Development. These resource Cores provide exceptional
facilities, cutting-edge bioinstrumentation, and experienced technical expertise in molecular biology, cellular
biology, histology, proteomics, genomics, imaging, disease modeling, biostatistics, data science, and artificial
intelligence services. The Center Core Grant will continue to sustain and promote conduct of exemplary basic
and translational inter- disciplinary and collaborative vision science research. It will provide the essential
catalysts needed to collectively advance knowledge of the biology and pathophysiology of the visual system
and develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for prevention of vision loss."
10883917,"Abstract
 We propose to combine mass spectrometry and machine learning to address racial
disparities in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. While African Americans have two to three
times the incidence rates of AD than people of European Ancestry, they are underrepresented
in past and current AD research studies. The lack of representation leads to a weaker
understanding of disease progression and poorer diagnostics for this population. The
overarching premise, that advances in diagnosing and treating Alzheimer's disease for all
Americans will be stymied unless differences among racial groups are considered, is supported
by the literature and demonstrated with preliminary data in the application. The aims of this
proposal are, therefore, designed to specifically address the need for a better understanding of
Alzheimer's disease in minority groups and to increase the diversity of patients that could be
correctly diagnosed with serum-based biomarker panels for AD. Successful completion of the
proposed research would accomplish several objectives: We would identify optimal feature
selection methods for `omics data; generate the best possible plasma biomarker panel for AD in
African Americans; and provide a systematic investigation of the extent to which existing MS-
`omics studies' accuracy of predicting AD are modulated by the participants' race."
10846822,"The overarching goal of our proposed Penn Artificial Intelligence and Technology (PennAITech)
Collaboratory is to identify, develop, evaluate, commercialize, and disseminate innovative technology for
monitoring aging adults and those with Alzheimerâs Disease (AD) and Alzheimerâs Disease Related Dementias
(ADRD) in their home environment and the artificial intelligence (AI) methods and software for analyzing data

technology-based monitoring of aging adults in the home, collection and processing monitoring data, integration
of those data with clinical data from electronic health records, analysis with cutting-edge AI methods and
software, and deployment of validated AI models at point of care for decision support. We have assembled a
team of experts with experience building and implementing each component of this pipeline and will promote
this vision and existing tools and software (AIM 1). A central focus of the PennAITech Collaboratory is to advance
this vision through the solicitation, review, and funding of pilot grants focused on technology and AI development
to advance the science of care management and aging in place for vulnerable older adults or those with

health of aging adults and those with AD/ADRD through these specific aims."
11026499,"The overall goal of the proposed research is to define the specific brain networks that are vulnerable or
resilient in aging and Alzheimerâs disease (AD), and subsequently derive new accurate, precise, and robust
connectomic imaging biomarkers for (especially preclinical) AD, which could improve diagnosis, disease staging,
prediction, assessment of progression, and therapeutic efficacy. Information flows in the human brain through a
complex set of structural and functional networks. The complete connectivity map among brain areas, i.e. the
connectome, can help to better understand the vulnerability and resilience of the brain architecture and function
to aging effects and debilitating neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD, and to discover diagnostically and
therapeutically important biomarkers. Focusing on brain regions, but not interregional connectivity, may have
hindered progress in understanding and treating disorders characterized as âdisconnection syndromesâ.
Diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) are used to noninvasively quantify
structural and functional brain networks, respectively. Network-based analysis of the brain has proved promising
in revealing the basis of cognitive dysfunction in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, demonstrating changes
distinct from those with healthy aging. Development of treatments to prevent or delay the onset of AD would be
greatly facilitated by a noninvasive, sensitive, and specific diagnostic biomarker able to discriminate cognitively
normal people and MCI patients who will progress to AD from those who will age healthily.
Structural connectivity between two brain regions is often defined based on the dMRI tractography-derived
streamlines between them. The direct fiber bundle connecting two brain areas is expected to be the major signal
carrier between them; however, multi-synaptic neural pathways (those mediated through other regions) also
provide connectivity. The investigators propose to develop and validate novel mathematical and algorithmic
models for brain connectivity, while accounting for multi-synaptic neural pathways (Aim 1). Furthermore, they
propose to include a comprehensive set of brain regions (Aim 2), given that some brain structures that are
important in AD, such as locus coeruleus, basal forebrain, and hypothalamus, are not readily included in
neuroimaging toolboxes. They also propose to identify compensatory connections contributing to resilience in
aging and preclinical AD (Aim 3). The completion of this study will improve our understanding of how brain
networks are affected in aging and AD and will help to derive more accurate AD biomarkers. In this connectomic
analysis, ten existing heterogeneous dMRI/rs-fMRI databases of healthy elderly, MCI, and AD populations,
totaling approximately 6000 subjects, will be combined, which is expected to improve stratification, prediction,
and prognosis. The investigators will validate their network-derived biomarkers via disease staging and
correlation with clinical and genetic data on cross-sectional datasets, and via prognosis and prediction of
conversion of healthy/MCI to AD on longitudinal datasets."
11160907,"As science is becoming data-intensive and collaborative, data sharing and reusing are becoming
increasingly important for rapid discovery and innovation. While sharing is as easy as few clicks
in this era of digital data, reusing is difficult unless some strict data curation standards are
followed. To address this issue, curation guidelines are provided to all SPARC funded researchers
for organizing and sharing their datasets such that researchers who were not directly involved in
data collection and analysis can rapidly understand and work with the data, as promoted by the
FAIR principles. Complying with these guidelines, however, requires additional time investment
from the researchers and is subject to human error. The data curation process could thus become
time-consuming and overwhelming as more and more data is generated and, eventually, steer
the focus away from data collection and analysis. The objective of this project is to continue the
development of SODA (Software for Organizing Data Automatically), the software being
developed to assist SPARC funded researchers in curating their datasets. Distributed as an opensource
and cross-platform desktop application, the goal of SODA is to bridge a long-standing,
overlooked gap between comprehensive data standards and their convenient application by
researchers. This is achieved by providing an interactive interface that, without requiring any
coding knowledge, walks SPARC researchers step-by-step through the data curation process, all
the while automating repetitive, complex, and time-consuming tasks. During this phase of
development, six new features will be added to SODA: 1) Full file organization interface with
lower-level folder support; 2) Collaborative data curation; 3) In-app updating; 4) Enhanced support
for generating metadata files; 5) Enhanced dataset validator; 6) File-level curation support. The
proposed project is very significant for its potential to simplify and enhance the SPARC data
curation process. Computer-assisted data curation will not only reduce the time required by
researchers to organize their data but also minimize â if not eliminate â human error. The resulting
rapid dissemination of SPARC data will enhance SPARCâs mission of accelerating the
development of therapeutic devices that modulate electrical activity in nerves to improve organ
function."
10867492,"PROJECT SUMMARY: OVERALL
Effective prevention, treatment, and recovery services for substance use disorders (SUD) and HIV demand an
increasing array of evidence-based interventions to address individuals' changing strengths, needs, and
circumstances. This can be achieved via adaptive interventions, which explicitly guide how to modify the type/
intensity of services based on information about the individual. Further, advances in digital technologies, such
as electronic health records (EHRs) and mobile devices, have created unprecedented opportunities to obtain
data for use in adapting interventions to different levels (e.g., individual, clinic, health system), modalities (e.g.,
digital, in-person), and/or time scales (e.g., monthly, many times a day). However, new research
methodologies are needed to realize these opportunities and inform a new generation of SUD/HIV services.
The focus of the proposed Center for Methodologies for Adapting and Personalizing Prevention, Treatment,
and Recovery Services for SUD and HIV (MAPS Center) is the development and dissemination of novel
research methodologies that are essential to optimize adaptive interventions to combat SUD/HIV. We propose
three exciting, thematically integrated research projects, each developing new methods to empirically inform
the construction of adaptive SUD/HIV services. Two innovative themes â optimization (i.e., developing
services that achieve the best expected outcome in a way that is not too expensive, complex, or demanding to
be scalable) and adaptation (i.e., using information about context and changing needs to decide when and how
to intervene) â cut across these projects, enabling our team to move SUD/HIV intervention science forward
while creating enormous potential for scientific synergy. Along with the three projects, two cores â
Dissemination & Training Core and Administrative Core â will enable the MAPS Center to serve as a national
resource by training SUD/HIV scientists in the critical use of the methods, recruiting scientists to work on
optimizing adaptive SUD/HIV services, and mentoring early career scholars. The overall Specific Aims of the
MAPS Center are: (Aim A) To develop novel experimental and data analytic methods to optimize the
adaptation of SUD/HIV services across different levels (e.g., individual, clinic), modalities (e.g., in-person,
digital), and time scales (e.g., monthly, daily); (Aim B) To serve as a national resource by placing the

11015948,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Down syndrome (DS), a trisomy of chromosome 21 and the most common genetic cause of intellectual
disability, was once a condition in which children would rarely see adulthood. In 1950, the estimated
mean life expectancy for a person with DS was 26 years and median age at death was 4 years. With
improvements in recognition and treatment of co-occurring conditions of DS, such as congenital heart
defects, the estimated median life expectancy in 2010 was 53 years (median age at death was 58).
There is now a large and diverse population with DS across all ages who are in dire need of solutions
and treatments for medical issues that were inconceivable 60 years ago. Two conditions of high interest
that often presage other morbidity, greatly harm quality of life, and lead to premature mortality are
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and dementia. OSA is an episodic sleep-state collapse of the upper
airway which results in reduction or lack of ventilation during sleep and is prevalent in more than half of
people with DS. The triplication of chromosome 21 in DS is associated with an overproduction of the
amyloid precursor protein and is pivotal to the accelerated development of dementia and Alzheimer's
disease. Even when not the proximal cause of death, in post-mortem autopsy nearly all older adults
with DS have beta amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that signify Alzheimer's disease. More
needs to be known about causes, course, and the impact of social determinants on these conditions
and resulting premature mortality, especially as clinical DS samples are often under powered and often
lack participants of color. To meet the directives of the National Institutes of Health's Investigation of
Co-occurring conditions across the lifespan in Down syndrome project and the National Institute on
Aging's priorities we propose to create Down Syndrome: Towards Optimal Trajectories and Health
Equity using Medicaid Analytic eXtract (DS-TO-THE-MAX). DS-TO-THE-MAX will identify a
retrospective longitudinal cohort of >100,000 adults with DS and >4,000,000 adults without DS from 10
years of Medicaid Analytic eXtract data plus additional Medicare data for dual enrollees. Our innovation
lies in a DS sample orders of magnitude larger than past work, a social determinants of health
framework, and novel machine learning and quantitative bias analysis methods. We will complete two
aims: 1) Assess epidemiology and social determinants of obstructive sleep apnea, dementia, and
mortality 2) Use machine learning to identify risk algorithms for obstructive sleep apnea, dementia, and
mortality. The results of this project will strengthen the epidemiologic and public health basis for DS
research and population level intervention. In building the DS-TO THE MAX cohort and assessing risk,
resilience, social determinants we will have a vital big data set to complement clinical research and
work toward the population with DS living long, healthy, and self-determined lives."
10907575,"Overall Component Summary
Centenarians delay age-related diseases and disabilities into their mid-nineties. Some remain
cognitively intact despite extreme exposure to the strongest risk factor for cognitive impairment
and AD, aging. The overall hypothesis of this study, titled âResilience/Resistance to AD in
Centenarians and Offspringâ (RADCO), is: centenarian cognitive superagers and some of their
offspring have protective factors that confer such resilience or in some cases, even resistance
against cognitive decline and dementia. RADCO assembles an unprecedentedly large sample of
prospectively studied centenarian cognitive superagers (n=495, essentially, centenarians with
cognitive function that falls within the norms of septuagenarians) along with offspring (n=600) and
offspring spouses (n=120), who, via RADCO cores, undergo careful, comprehensive and cutting
edge neuropsychological, biomarker, neuroimaging and neuropathological phenotyping. These
data are used by two projects with the overall scientific objective of gauging cognitive resilience
in this sample, understanding the underlying protective biology and translating that into
therapeutic targets. The Cognitive Resilience and Resistance Phenotypes Project (Project 1)
gauges resilience by neuroimaging, plasma AD biomarkers risk and neuropathology and therefore
generates a range of resilience endophenotypes. The Protective Factors and Mechanisms Project
(Project 2) is the translation arm of RADCO; it discovers genes, candidate biological pathways
and sets of mi-RNA regulators associated with the resilience endophenotypes characterized in
Project 1. In-vitro models of AD incorporate cortical neurons, microglial cells and astrocytes
created from centenarian cognitive superager induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines are used
to test the candidate pathways for how they cause resilience against AD."
11082249,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Overall):
The primary goal is to establish a multicenter SuperAging Consortium to identify behavioral, health, biologic,
genetic, environmental, socioeconomic, psychosocial, anatomic and neuropathologic factors associated with
SuperAging. These goals will be achieved through an organizational structure with 3 Cores
(Administrative/Biostatistics, Clinical/Imaging, and Biospecimen/Neuropathology) and 2 Research Projects. The
Consortium will enroll 500 participants across 4 US Sites located in Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan and Georgia,
and the Canadian Site in Southwest, Ontario, with a focus on the enrollment of Black SuperAgers and Cognitively
Average Elderly Controls with similar demographics (Controls). The Administrative/Biostatistics Core will
provide governance and fiscal oversight, maintain scientific integrity, and create a centralized biostatistics and
database infrastructure to harmonize the goals and activities of the Cores, Sites, and Projects, with each other,
with the NIA and with extramural collaborators. The Clinical/Imaging Core will standardize criteria for the
uniform cross-site and multidisciplinary characterization of SuperAgers, streamline recruitment including that of
Black participants, enter relevant information in the comprehensive database, support co-enrollment into Project
1, and encourage collaborative ventures aiming to understand the factors that promote SuperAging. The
Biospecimen/Neuropathology Core will collect and bank brain tissue and blood products from SuperAging
and Control cases, according to optimized procedures. It will render pathological diagnoses, quantitate selected
markers of neurodegeneration and neuronal structure, coordinate the analyses of plasma biomarkers for
Alzheimer's disease, and make specimens available for collaborative investigations. Project 1 will use state-of-
the-art wearable technology to obtain real-time measurements in the course of everyday life to characterize
quantitative parameters related to sleep, physical activity, autonomic responsivity, and social engagement to
determine whether SuperAgers have relatively preserved and quantitatively determined physiologic and
behavioral `complexity' compared to Controls. Project 2 will use transcriptomic, genetic, and protein profiling
approaches to test the hypothesis that SuperAgers will demonstrate significant molecular differences in their
central and peripheral immune and inflammatory system parameters compared to matched Control and
Alzheimer's disease participants. By identifying neurobiologic features that contribute to superior memory
performance in old age, outcomes from this Consortium will help isolate factors that promote successful cognitive
aging and perhaps also prevent age-related brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease."
10512045,"The development and approval of new drugs (such as PARP inhibitors) marks a breakthrough in
prostate cancer treatment. Despite this progress, metastatic prostate cancer remains a lethal
disease highlighting a critical need for discovery of biomarkers and development of tests that can
timely identify prostate cancer patients who are at highly elevated risk for developing metastatic
disease before it appears. Having such a test would allow clinicians to treat these patients early
to stop disease progression to its aggressive form.
The proposed study identifies predictive biomarkers and describes useful clinical testing for their
presence in the human genome. Our preliminary analysis of Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)
datasets and samples from our unique cohort of prostate cancer patients shows that specific
polymorphic L1 retrotransposons (pL1s) are enriched in the genomes of patients with metastatic
prostate cancer, meaning that this genetic variable is a potential new and powerful marker of
aggressive disease. Prior work has shown that pL1s can contribute to cancer by insertional
mutagenesis. Our findings show that in addition to previously reported insertional mutagenesis,
pL1s cause large genomic deletions, making the presence of more pL1s in some patients'
genomes highly relevant to prostate cancer progression. Furthermore, we have developed and
experimentally validated the utility of a novel, high throughput method for detection of pL1s in
human DNA. This method is more sensitive and cost effective than WGS, making performing a
case-control study of genomic pL1 content on hundreds or thousands of samples possible.
Capitalizing on these findings and methods, we hypothesize that a high number of specific pL1s
present in the genomes of prostate cancer patients is associated with an increased risk of
developing metastatic disease because these elements drive genomic instability and, thus,
disease progression. We propose two specific aims that use our unique cohort composed of
patients with either indolent or aggressive prostate cancers, available WGS datasets, and our
novel methodologies to test this hypothesis. Aim 1 will perform a case-control study to identify
pL1s present in genomes of prostate cancer patients in our cohort. Aim 2 will perform targeted
sequencing of genes frequently mutated in metastatic prostate cancer to identify pL1-associated
mutations and novel mechanisms by which pL1s may contribute to cancer progression.
By interrogating the genomes of ~400 prostate cancer patients for the presence of pL1s and for
mutations in genes relevant to prostate cancer, the proposed study will determine whether the
number and/or composition of pL1s in patient genomes (alone or in combination with identified
gene mutations) is positively associated with aggressive prostate cancer and to determine the
frequency of mutagenic events cause by pL1s in specific genes. The long-term outcome of the
success of this proposal will be clinically ready reliable genetic tests prospectively identifying men,
including Veterans, who are at high risk of developing aggressive prostate cancer. The test could
be performed using blood DNA at any time, including prior to prostate cancer diagnosis."
11065745,"ABSTRACT
Differences in our individual genomes give rise to most of human diversity. This uniqueness of every human
being underpins the purpose of precision medicine, which posits that disease prediction, diagnosis, and
treatment for each individual is based on personal genomic variations. The rapid advancement of genome
editing technology has led to numerous promising preclinical studies in muscular dystrophies (MDs). These
studies were performed in inbred animals, with mice being the most extensively used models, in which the
component of genetic diversity has been largely ignored. Genetically speaking, developing a therapeutic
intervention in a single inbred mouse strain is the equivalent of treating a single patient and limits the
generalizability and translatability of the results into human applications. Failure to anticipate the genetic
diversity in patient populations will confound future clinical trials and may lead to adverse outcomes.
In this NIH Innovator Award, my goal is to revolutionize the conventional method by which we develop genetic
therapy to reflect diverse and more realistic human populations. First, I will integrate the naturally occurring
genetic reference panel into a model harboring MD-causing mutation to better simulate diverse patient
population and elevate its translational value. I will use this innovative model to investigate whether the
introduced genetic variation profoundly modifies the neuromuscular presentations. Furthermore, I will study
the implications of genetic variation on the safety and efficacy of therapeutic genome editing approaches that
I have developed throughout my career.
As we move closer towards designing clinical treatment that is based on an individual's biological makeup, it
is imperative that we understand how inherited variability influences disease phenotypes, how it can confound
experiments, and how it can be exploited to reveal new truths about disease biology. Using MD as a starting
point, successful outcome of this project can be integrated into a framework for future therapeutic
developments in different diseases and across patient populations."
11009676,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The perception of pain is caused by intense or damaging noxious stimuli, such as extremes in temperature
or force. The ability to detect noxious stimuli is fundamental for survival as it provides a salient reminder to
animals of imminent or persistent danger. There have been significant efforts in understanding how the
brain generates the perception of pain. Notably, our most efficacious pharmacological treatment for pain
target opiate receptors, which are notorious for their potential for abuse and act primarily on neural circuits
in the brain. Strikingly, there is a comparatively little known about how noxious stimuli are detected initially
by primary sensory neurons known as nociceptors. Nociceptors act as the âfirst-respondersâ by detecting
noxious stimuli through axonal projections present in peripheral organs, such as the skin. This information
is then relayed to the brain via synaptic connections made with spinal cord neurons. In order to develop
new pain therapeutics, there is a fundamental need to advance our cellular and molecular understanding of
the peripheral nociceptors. In a recently published study, I performed scRNA-seq on hundreds of thousand
sensory neurons, which identified multiple previously unknown and highly distinct subtypes of nociceptor
neurons, likely with distinct functional roles. In this proposal, the laboratory will focus on implementing our
recently developed molecular genetic tools and approaches to fundamentally advance our understanding
of the first step in pain-processing. We will highlight a three-tiered plan, in which I will thoroughly examine
(Tier 1) the anatomical/biophysical features of nociceptor subtypes, (Tier 2) the molecular mechanisms
underlying noxious stimuli detection by nociceptor subtypes and (Tier 3) the behavioral consequences
during activating/silencing of each nociceptor subtype. we aim to take advantage of my extensive prior
research experience, as well as key preliminary advances, to develop a molecular and cellular
understanding of how nociceptors detect noxious stimuli."
10925258,"Overall â Project Summary
The broad goal of this proposal is to provide core support services for 25 NEI R01 funded investigators and
other vision scientists at the University of Washington to enhance the quality and quantity of their research, to
facilitate collaborations between investigators with different backgrounds and skills, to recruit new investigators
to vision research, to help young investigators establish their labs and to allow established investigators to
explore new directions. The 25 NEI R01 funded investigators together hold 32 NEI R01 grants. Two additional
investigators, each with a long history of NEI R01 funding, have pending NEI R01 competing renewals.
Collectively, the University of Washington vision scientists represent a broad variety of vision research
expertise, ranging from molecules to behavior with the shared goals of elucidating basic mechanisms of the
visual system and its disorders, and developing potential treatments and preventions for vision loss. To help
these investigators achieve their common goals we have organized facilities, services, and shared
instrumentation into three modules:
 (1) Microscopy and Histology
 (2) Molecular and Cellular Biology
 (3) Functional Analysis of the Visual System and In Vivo Ocular Imaging
These modules provide resources commonly used by multiple laboratories that are essential to the success of
on-going projects as well as to enable new collaborations. The University of Washington is committed to the
support of Vision Science, having recently built two new state-of-the-art research buildings, SLU3.1 and
SLU3.2, that house vision research. The University established the 25,000 square foot (sq. ft.) Vision Science
Center in SLU3.1 in 2013, and the 5,000 sq. ft. Karalis Johnson Retina Research Center in SLU3.2 in 2019.
Since 2013, the University has provided more than $3,000,000 in funds for the purchase of equipment for the
Vision Science Center including for the Vision Research Core, and for the Karalis Johnson Retina Center.
Since the last competing renewal, the University provided competitive start-up packages in the recruitment of
three junior vision research faculty across three departments.
In this proposal, we request support for the Vision Research Core to help maintain shared instrumentation
through service contracts, to provide personnel support for module scientists who assist and train investigators
and their staff in the use of the equipment, to provide select services and specialized expertise to avoid
duplication of equipment."
10456986,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal focuses on targeting neoantigens in malignant brain tumors in well defined orthotopic, syngeneic
preclinical models, understanding how type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1) prime neoantigens, and how
immune responses to neoantigens develop in newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) patients enrolled in a
novel clinical trial combining personalized vaccination with checkpoint blockade. GBM remains a lethal cancer
and carries a median survival of 15 months with standard-of-care treatments, highlighting a clear need for
more effective treatments. The application of genomics to immunotherapeutic approaches is an exciting area
of investigation in many cancer types, and this proposal employs this methodology. This nexus, termed âcancer
immunogenomicsâ, is used to identify tumor-specific somatic mutations that may be processed and presented
on major histocompatibility molecules. These âneoantigensâ can be recognized by the immune system and
form the basis for anti-tumor immune responses. We have applied the cancer immunogenomics approach to
the study of GBM both in preclinical models as well as in a novel personalized immuno-oncology cancer
vaccine program for GBM patients. However, in order to fully exploit the potential of targeting neoantigens in
GBM, further work is needed to understand whether targeting multiple neoantigen targets using polyvalent
vaccines can improve tumor control and how neoantigens are presented to the immune system in brain
cancers. How antigen is presented in the central nervous system remains unclear, and understanding the
immunobiology of this process is inextricably linked to effective neoantigen targeting. In parallel, it is critical to
determine how anti-tumor immunity is amplified in patients treated with personalized cancer vaccines in
combination with immunopotentiating checkpoint blockade therapies. To this end, we are applying cancer
immunogenomics preclinically and translationally to address these key questions. In Aim 1, we will determine
the effectiveness of polyvlalent neoantigen vaccination targeting MHC class and and/or MHC class II
neoantigens on survival and the immunologic effects of these vaccines on the brain tumor microenvironment.
In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that cDC1 present neoantigen in vivo and can augment the efficacy of
neoantigen-targeting vaccines. We will also further characterize the anatomic location of this critical cell
population during the anti-tumor immune response. In Aim 3, we will perform correlative analysis of a novel
clinical trial we are conducting to determine whether checkpoint blockade agents augment the immune
responses generated with personalized vaccines and whether the genomes of recurrent tumors that progress
on this trial are remodeled and/or show evidence of neoantigen specific cancer immunoediting. Together,
these Aims will provide new insights into an immunogenomics-centered approach to treating GBM as well as
the immunobiology of neoantigen presenation and T cell specific immune priming that has clear and imperative
clinical implications."
10876371,"Airway remodeling is the term applied to the structural changes observed in the airway in asthma, and includes
an increase in airway wall thickness which is associated with an increase in airway smooth muscle (ASM)
mass, sub-epithelial fibrosis, mucus metaplasia of epithelial cells, abnormalities in composition of the
extracellular matrix, and an increase in peribronchial vascularity. Although current NIH guidelines recommend
maintaining a goal of normal lung function in asthma, current therapeutic strategies in asthma are not able to
specifically target airway remodeling as the cellular and molecular mechanisms that result in remodeling are
not well defined. Studies have also demonstrated that severe asthmatics with increased ASM on
endobronchial biopsy have lower lung function (FEV1) compared to asthmatics with less ASM. Thus, ASM
remodeling may contribute significantly to lower FEV1 in severe asthma. Although severe asthmatics
comprise only approximately 5% of all asthmatics, they utilize a significant amount of health care resources
(approximately 40% of the estimated $50 billion direct costs of asthma/year in the USA). As airway remodeling
in severe asthma can contribute to lower lung function and a greater decline in lung function, there is an
important need to identify mechanisms by which airway remodeling is mediated so that potential novel
therapies could be directed at these pathways. The UCSD AADCRC will test the hypothesis that novel non-
TH2-based inflammatory pathways in immune cells, inflammatory cells and epithelial cells mediate airway
remodeling in severe asthma. In support of this overall hypothesis, Project 1 (Broide) has identified that
Gasdermin A (GSDMA) is expressed at increased levels in epithelial cells in asthma, inhibits antiviral defense
pathways in epithelium, which can trigger severe RV-induced asthma exacerbations with decline in lung
function and airway remodeling. Project 2 (Croft) has identified that TNF family members LIGHT and TL1A
(both increased expression in severe asthma) can directly induce human ASM and fibroblast remodeling
underscoring the importance of this pathway to remodeling in severe asthma. Project 3 (Vijayanand) has
identified increased frequency of a novel T cell population (i.e. cytotoxic TRM cells) in the airways of severe
asthmatics, which may help to explain persistent T cell-driven inflammation and airway remodeling not due to
known T cell populations (TH2 or TH1). We anticipate that each of the thee projects will identify selective
pathways to airway remodeling, as well as shared pathways to remodeling that we have identified related to
TRM cells, LIGHT/TL1A, and GSDMA. Novel pathways inducing airway remodeling in severe asthma will be
tested in each project using human airway structural cells and TRM cells obtained by BAL, brushing, and
endobronchial biopsy by âSevere Asthma Clinical Core Bâ from severe asthmatics and controls (mild asthma;
non-asthma). Overall, these studies will identify potential novel therapeutic targets to inhibit airway remodeling
and prevent decline in lung function in severe asthma."
11144798,"Project Summary/Abstract: During development, cellular diversity is achieved via the dynamic interpretation
of a fixed DNA template, a process that incorporates both straightforward genetic and obscure epigenetic
concepts. Cell identity is in part governed by transcription factor-directed programs, but these interact with
elaborate âcodesâ of post-translational modifications to chromatin that index regions of the genome for activity or
repression. To date, the general relationships between local chromatin remodeling and gene regulation have
been primarily modeled in cell lines and cannot yet account for the intricacy of the developing embryo. Moreover,
although many epigenetic regulators are essential for viable embryogenesis, it remains unclear how these
enzymes participate in specific developmental processes given the generic nature of their target substrates. A
detailed accounting of how epigenetic regulation operates during gestation is critical to understand complex
congenital or fetal disorders, which often have unclear penetrance, affect multiple cell types or tissue systems,
and can be highly influenced by the maternal environment. Here, I propose a transformative new strategy for
comprehensively phenotyping mutant embryos that incorporates detailed micromanipulation techniques, novel
molecular systems, and single cell analysis to recover high resolution morphological, molecular and temporal
information from many replicates simultaneously. My flexible approach permits rapid transition from hypothesis
to validation and eliminates many cumbersome aspects of traditional transgenics, as well as the frequent
limitation of examining only a limited number of lineages via a handful of pre-specified marker genes. I will apply
this pipeline to dissect the specific regulatory impact of maternal dietary folate and of the Polycomb group
repressors on early organogenesis, which represent âtop-downâ and âbottom-upâ approaches to interpret
developmental robustness, the deliberate and reproducible generation of a sophisticated organism under
uncertain and fluctuating conditions. To do so, I will leverage my ability to recover data from mutant cohorts and
optimize new analytical strategies to quantify phenotypic variation and incomplete penetrance. These factors
are central concerns of reproductive medicine and have been extraordinarily challenging to reduce to clear
molecular mechanisms or pathways, subsequently limiting innovation of novel interventions and diagnostics. In
addition to addressing fundamental human health issues, these efforts will also substantially advance a suite of
new tools for exogenously titrating specific regulatory components as well as for recording the historical
relationship between single cells. If successful, this proposal will uncover previously opaque dimensions of
embryonic regulation, including shared and cell-type specific consequences of epigenetic or environmental
insults, as well as transform general methods for characterizing previously intractable congenital abnormalities."

10472787,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The recent wave of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies on amyloid fibrils has highlighted the complexity
of protein deposition amongst patients of amyloid diseases. A convincing example is found in tau, a microtubule
binding protein whose pathological aggregation causes tauopathies. Each of these tauopathies seems to be
associated with a particular structural assembly, suggesting causality. Similar to tauopathies, other amyloid
diseases manifest differential prognosis, onset, and symptomatology. This is the case of TDP-43, Î±-synuclein,
Î²-amyloid, or transthyretin (TTR), to name a few. We hypothesize that these phenotypical differences are driven
by the formation of various structural assemblies, similar to what is found in tau. As a consequence, the detection
of these disease-specific assemblies in a timely manner could ensure proper diagnosis and treatment.
We aim to map the structural spectrum of amyloid fibrils in an amyloid disease model using cryo-EM and a co-
culture system to be developed in our laboratory. Using the obtained structural information, our laboratory will
design structure-specific peptides for the detection and inhibition of amyloid fibrils in cells, mice, and patient-
derived samples. If successful, our study will serve as a launching platform for the development of personalized
structure-based diagnostics and therapeutics for amyloid diseases."

The proposed University of Washington (UW) Developmental AIDS Research Center (D-ARC) responds to the
global HIV epidemic at a critical stage. Though more than 21 million people around the world receive antiretroviral
therapy, the most marginalized populations continue to experience high incidence, less access to effective
prevention and care, and greater mortality. Unmet needs persist in high-prevalence countries as well as
âgeographic hotspotsâ in the US such as Seattle's King County. Intersecting stigma, trauma, poverty, and
substance abuse increase risk for mental illnesses, yet the effective treatments available are rarely implemented.
The proposed D-ARC aims to address these challenges by catalyzing research that helps end the
epidemic, with a focus on integrating care for mental disorders into HIV prevention and treatment
strategies. Furthermore, Center investigators will support and apply the science of dissemination and
implementation, with the overall goal of bringing such interventions to scale. The D-ARC aims to fill a gap
in HIV behavioral science research at UW by capitalizing on the considerable strengths of UW's HIV expertise
and bridging this with UW's longstanding leadership in the development and delivery of models of integrated
mental health care. By combining UW expertise in (a) HIV research and (b) mental health careânow siloed
geographically, programmatically, and conceptuallyâthe Center will be a synergistic force capable of realizing
is mission of Implementing Innovative Impactful Integrated Interventions. The proposed infrastructure capitalizes
on the strengths of local expertise and broad ties with global collaborative networks, adding value to UW through
the Center's administration, research support, and training missions, buttressed through additional institutional
commitments of $762,296. Cross-cutting themes of the D-ARC are (a) leveraging local and global bidirectional
pathways to learning and innovation by engaging communities of providers and (b) addressing inequities by
testing research solutions that reduce disparities. Four proposed Cores address the Overall specific aims: 1)
Catalyze and support innovative and impactful research to curb the HIV epidemic, with a focus on integrated
intervention strategies (Administrative Core); 2) Provide needed technical assistance and training on research
design, measurement, theory and novel statistical methods relevant to mental health and HIV research (Methods
Core); 3) Stimulate practice-based research that promotes effective integrated mental health services in HIV
care settings and disseminate findings broadly (Integrated Care Core); and 4) Nurture the Next Generation of
diverse, multidisciplinary HIV researchers through training and innovative mentorship of early stage investigators
and mentors (Developmental Core)."
10703345,"Project Summary/Abstract
Rationale: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is complicated by high failure rates in young
active individuals. Failure of ACLR is associated with limited activity, reduced quality of life, increased
socioeconomic costs and higher rates of osteoarthritis (OA). A lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) may
provide greater stability to the ACLR; but, its effect on failure rate is unclear and surgery-induced lateral
compartment OA is a concern. A meta-analysis suggests that bone-patellar-tendon-bone (BPTB) grafts
provide better stability compared to a hamstring tendon (HT) grafts, albeit with greater donor site
morbidity. Recently, the quadriceps tendon (QT) has become a popular graft choice claiming stability
equivocal to BPTB but without donor site morbidity. By evaluating whether one graft is superior at
reducing failure rates and minimizing donor site morbidity and by determining whether the addition of an
LET contributes to reduced failure, this study (STABILITY 2) addresses NIAMSâ mission to contribute to
knowledge related to the treatment and prevention of arthritis and NIHâs mission to enhance health and
reduce disability.
Specific Aims:
1. To determine if graft type (QT, BPTB or HT) with or without a LET affects the rate of graft failure 2 years
 after ACLR.
2. To determine if graft type (QT, BPTB or HT) with or without a LET affects patient-reported symptoms,
 function & QOL, performance-based measures of function and return-to-sports 2 years after ACLR.
3. To determine if graft type (QT, BPTB or HT) with or without LET affects rates of intervention-related
 donor site morbidity, complications and adverse outcomes 2 years after ACLR.
4. To determine if the addition of a particular graft type (QT, BPTB or HT) with or without a LET is a more
 cost-effective approach to ACLR.
Methods: This study will include 21 sites across the USA, Canada, and Europe and will randomly assign
1200 patients to either QT (+/- LET) or BPTB (+/- LET). Randomization will be stratified by surgeon, sex
and the status of the meniscus. Patients will follow a standardized rehabilitation protocol. Outcomes will be
assessed over two years postoperative by a blinded evaluator and include failure status, functional
performance, patient-reported function, quality of life and return-to-sport; presence of donor site morbidity,
lateral joint space narrowing; and costs associated with failure. Data from a previously performed HT+/-
LET RCT (STABILITY 1) will be combined with STABILITY 2 data. Analyses will follow intention-to-treat
and primarily consist of mixed effects modeling."
10744699,"Veterans exposed to trauma are at elevated risk for perpetration of intimate partner violence
(IPV) and for the development of alcohol-related problems. Despite commonly found
associations between alcohol misuse and IPV, we are aware of no prior research in Veterans
examining the impact of adjunctive alcohol interventions for those receiving IPV intervention.
We propose to provide much-needed experimental data on the efficacy of a brief alcohol
Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) pre-group intervention for Veterans receiving group
treatment for IPV perpetration. More specifically, we propose to examine whether those
assigned to receive this MET intervention, relative to those receiving a 4-session Alcohol
Education (AE) intervention or a standard treatment as usual (TAU) telephone monitoring
intervention, evidence greater reductions in alcohol use problems and IPV perpetration, and
increased help-seeking behavior for alcohol use problems. Participants will be {300} male
Veterans drawn from the Strength at Home IPV intervention program at three locations: the
Minneapolis VA Medical Center, the Phoenix VA Healthcare System, {and VA Ann Arbor
Healthcare System}. Participants will be randomized to their pre-group conditions and then
assigned to Strength at Home groups for IPV, and will receive referrals for substance use
treatment in the VA system or the community. Participants with clinically relevant alcohol use
problems, as determined by baseline screening measures, will complete assessments of
alcohol use, readiness to change, IPV and help-seeking behavior at baseline, post IPV
intervention group (3 months after completion of 4-session alcohol intervention), and four
separate 3-month follow-ups after the post-treatment assessment. Collateral partners will
participate via phone interview assessments for all of the IPV measures corresponding with the
assessment schedule for the male participants. Differences between conditions on the major
outcome variables involving alcohol use, IPV, help-seeking, and treatment engagement will be
examined with random-effects regression models using an intent-to-treat approach. Study
findings may assist in enhancing the efficacy of IPV interventions for the Veteran population to
help ensure the safety and well-being of Veterans, their relationship partners, and their families."
10908343,"A substantial cadre of investigators at the University of Colorado are focused on characterizing the molecular
origins and causal mechanisms that drive the initiation and preclinical phases of rheumatic and autoimmune
diseases. One of the most important outcomes of those efforts has been the demonstration in populations at-
risk for future disease that dysbiosis and chronic inflammation at mucosal sites can promote the initial local
development of disease-specific loss of tolerance to autoantigens. Ultimately, this process leads to systemic
autoimmunity and the development of diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthroarthritis
(SpA). Building on that concept with unique at-risk populations and an extensive programmatic infrastructure, a
P30 Rheumatic Disease Research Resource Center (RDRRC) entitled âCenter for Mucosal Immunobiology
and Rheumatic Disease Pathogenesisâ is proposed. Included in the Center are an Administrative Core, a
Population and Data Sciences Core, and a Mucosal Immunobiology Core. This Center is specifically designed
to facilitate studies of human disease pathogenesis that incorporate the broad range of mucosal and systemic
immunologic techniques, as well as develop new approaches, to study these integrated mechanisms in already
recruited cohorts of individuals throughout the preclinical and then clinically active phases of disease. The
Center includes 43 internal and external members who have in aggregate $77M in related annual direct cost
grant funding. In addition to providing access to stored biospecimens and data from ongoing population
studies, the Center will provide consultative and member discount mechanisms for all of the critical aspects of
cohort development, epidemiologic assessment, data management and data analyses. In addition, the Center
will provide members access to technologies that focus on analyses of the microbiome and microbial:cell
interactions, as well as informative mucosal and peripheral immune biomarkers. The Center will build on a
recent $80M investment from the Dean to fund four other relevant programs with which this Center will interact.
Dr. Michael Holers, Professor of Medicine and Immunology, will serve as the Center Director, and Dr. Kristi
Kuhn, Associate Professor of Medicine, will serve as the Associate Director. Both will interact with Advisory
and Executive Committees, and in the latter will be joined by Core Directors and Co-Directors with domain
expertise. As a key component of the mission of the Center, a Pilot & Feasibility Grants Program will be
developed with substantial institutional support. Additional Enrichment Program activities will include a seminar
series, technology assessment series, and an annual symposium. A major focus will be on early career
investigator development through enhanced Core access as well as Grants Review and a Scholars Programs.
Social media, web-based outreach and newsletters will provide comprehensive communication. Finally, a
Patient Impact Program will be utilized for the assessment and enhanced translation of novel biomarkers and
therapeutically relevant RDRRC discoveries into direct patient care with the goal to improve outcomes."
10947429,"ABSTRACT
Alzheimerâs disease and epilepsy are common age-related CNS disorders. Both Alzheimerâs disease and
epilepsy are more frequent in the elderly compared to any other age groups, and a history of epilepsy is a risk
factor for development of Alzheimerâs and related dementias. Further, patients with Alzheimerâs disease have
unprovoked seizures and epilepsy at a significantly higher rate than non-demented elderly. These public health
correlations are seen at the level of pathophysiology and manifested symptoms. For example, cognitive
impairment is a definitive aspect of Alzheimerâs disease, and recurrent epileptic seizures are associated with
cognitive impairment. Clearly, the increase in aging of the worldâs population makes this comorbidity a major
concern. This proposal is focused on addressing a common pathophysiological mechanism in Alzheimerâs and
epilepsy â dysregulated proinflammatory cytokine production. Proinflammatory cytokine overproduction from
abnormally activated glia is a contributor to subsequent neurological damage and cognitive deficits in both
epilepsy/seizure disorders and in Alzheimerâs and related dementias. Despite advances in our understanding
of these molecular neuroinflammatory mechanisms underlying adverse neuronal sequelae in CNS disorders,
approved therapeutics that target this pathological process are lacking. ImmunoChem Therapeutics (ICT)
proposes to advance MW189, a novel small molecule candidate already in early phase clinical development,
having successfully completed phase 1a and phase 1b clinical trials. MW189 is a selective suppressor of
injury- and disease-induced proinflammatory cytokine overproduction associated with destructive glia
inflammation/synaptic dysfunction cycles and their long-term neurotoxic effects. This proposed Fast-Track
SBIR will deliver a phase 2a trial-ready portfolio for future first-in-patient (FIP) epilepsy treatment trials.
Specifically, we will: 1. Develop a commercial-scale version of a validated GMP clinical grade drug production
approach, produce a multi-Kg drug substance lot, and obtain its release for future patient clinical trials,
2. Obtain preclinical efficacy data for dosing information and the biological rationale required to support future
phase 2a proof-of-concept studies in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, 3. Prepare required documents and
submit a phase 2 IND for a future clinical trial in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.
Our milestones and their associated key tasks are organized as SBIR Phase I activities (year 01) and SBIR
Phase II activities (years 02-03). The Fast-Track structure will allow us to immediately move to SBIR Phase II
activities that flow seamlessly from preparation and technology transfer to essential milestones for a future FIP
safety trial including pharmacokinetics and a pharmacodynamic arm. Success will also further de-risk MW189
for future phase 2 trials in Alzheimerâs disease or other age-related disorders that involve dysregulated
neuroinflammation as a driver of disease progression."
10795728,"Project Summary
Transcranial current stimulation (TCS) creates small electrical fields in the brain through electrodes placed on
the scalp. As a method for neuromodulation, TCS carries with it many practical benefits: it is portable (battery-
operated), inexpensive, and easily deployable in the clinic and at home. Due to this simplicity and apparent
versatility there has been an explosion in the number of studies currently underway using transcranial currents
(over 500 clinical trials on clinicaltrials.gov).
Despite this ubiquity and potential, even basic questions about the nature of neural changes induced by various
forms of TCS have not been answered in-vivo. This lack of understanding of the underlying biology has led to
skepticism about the method. Moreover, refinement of the technique as used in humans is limited to a relatively
inefficient process that proceeds largely by trial and error.
This project will use state-of-the-art imaging techniques in awake mice to gain insight how TCS affect changes
in neural activity. The project will use the exquisite spatial resolution of two-photon imaging, together with genetic
methods to target specific cell populations, to reveal how TCS affects neural activity in a cell-type, and layer
specific manner. This high-spatial resolution technique will be complemented with high temporal resolution
voltage sensitive dye imaging to assess the temporal aspects of these induced changes, including the
entrainment of oscillations.
Together these complementary approaches will provide insight how TCS affects neural activity at an
unprecedented level of detail. This insight - for instance understanding whether all cell-types are affected equally,
or the TCS dose needed to achieve meaningful entrainment of neural activity - is essential for the rational
development of targeted TCS protocols."
11014624,"Project Summary
Bacterial biofilms are surface-attached communities of bacterial cells enclosed in an extracellular matrix.
Biofilms are a concern in health and in industrial operations because of persistent infections, clogging of flows,
and surface fouling. Recent advances in single-cell live imaging have revealed well-defined cell ordering in
individual biofilm clusters and the underlying biomechanical principles that shape them. However, we have little
understanding of which genes are activated in each biofilm-dwelling cell and how cell organization is
determined by the gene expression pattern at the single-cell level. We do not know whether and how gene
expression profiles vary from cell to cell in biofilms, and what consequences such heterogeneity has on biofilm
development. Cell-to-cell variation in biofilms could underly the notorious difficulty in eradicating biofilms in
chronic infections because of the differential response of biofilm cells to antibiotic treatment. In this proposal
we put forward ideas to address this challenge by developing new imaging platforms to capture the biofilm
growth dynamics and associated gene expression pattern at the single-cell level. Using these imaging
platforms, we will uncover the intricate interplay between single-cell gene expression, individual cell behavior,
and local cell organization that underlies the developmental program of bacterial biofilms. Specifically, we will
use deep learning algorithms to push the temporal and spatial resolution limits in single-cell biofilm imaging,
and develop an innovative, coupled segmentation-tracking method to generate a robust three-dimensional
lineage tracing algorithm in growing biofilms. By combining lineage tracing and fluorescent reporters, we will
follow the spatiotemporal expression pattern of each individual cell throughout biofilm development. By
focusing on matrix production, degradation, and cell dispersion, we will create concrete examples of gene
expression heterogeneity at the single-cell level and the associated consequences in 3D biofilms. In addition,
we will investigate heterogeneity in genes involved in intra- and intercellular signaling, in motility and
attachment, and in cell shape regulation to broaden our finding. With these efforts, we will reveal how individual
gene expression, cell behavior, and local cell ordering reciprocally interact with each other to define biofilm
architecture and development. The knowledge obtained in the current proposal offers new strategies for
manipulating complex bacterial communities and has the potential to change the clinical procedure of treating
biofilm-related diseases, for example by developing new chemicals that specifically induce dispersal or target
the recalcitrant cell populations."

We propose multidisciplinary studies to comprehensively evaluate the roles of contact, fomite, sprayborne, and
aerosol transmission and how they interact with ventilation to facilitate human-to-human influenza transmission
using a suite of innovative technologies for improved sampling, fractionation, culture, and characterization of
influenza virus aerosols. These studies leverage our highly diverse team of experts in bioengineering, aerosol
science, human challenge and clinical trials, influenza virology and immunology, infectious diseases
epidemiology, aerobiology, and computational fluid dynamics. The proposal is organized around two research
projects and three cores. In Research Project 1, âEvaluating Modes of Influenza Transmission using a
Randomized Controlled Trial (EMIT-2-RCT)â we will study the impact of two interventions a) ventilation and air
sanitation and b) hand hygiene and face shields on transmission of circulating seasonal influenza from
naturally infected cases to serologically susceptible volunteers. We will use the RCT to test hypotheses that
aerosol transmission is the dominant mode, is associated with greater frequency of fever and systemic
symptoms in secondary cases, and that in the absence of hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies, antibodies
against other targets will strongly correlate with protection from infection and disease. In Research Project 2,
âDeveloping and Applying Analytical Models of Influenza Transmissionâ we will use computational fluid
dynamics and novel new aerosol measurements to a) design interventions and sampling strategies for the
RCT enabling us to distinguish short- and long-range aerosol transmission from sprayborne transmission, b)
define the Wells-Riley aerosol quantum of infection in terms of measurable quantities and assess risk at the
recipient breathing zone level in both well-mixed and non-well-mixed indoor air conditions, and c) extend our
models to household and animal studies and create practical analytical tools for public health scientists to
collect data and assess risk in the field. The Research Projects will be enabled by an Advanced Bioaerosol
Technology Core (ABTC) that will develop new viral aerosol sampling and culture systems and methods for
both ambient and exhaled breath sampling that will validate the RCT design and provide critical inputs to the
analytical models. A Clinical and Biostatistics Core (CBC) will provide the clinical infrastructure to perform the
complex quarantine studies. The Administrative Core will manage these tightly integrated components to mold
transdisciplinary insights into the dynamics and drivers of influenza transmission between humans."
10894640,"ABSTRACT_Overall
Preventing HIV-1 acquisition and extinguishing virus replication is a key goal for vaccine and
immunoprophylaxis strategies. Diverse antibody (Ab) Fc receptor (FcR)-mediated functions and multiple
effector cell populations engage in vivo in a joint merger to thwart infection. An improved understanding of
specific functional and qualitative features of the humoral response and how they contribute to protective
efficacy is needed. Results from immune correlates analyses of vaccine efficacy trials, immunoprophylaxis
trials and preclinical studies indicate that antibody constant (Fc) region mediated antiviral activity is an
untapped source of antiviral functions to afford broad and potent protection against HIV infection. Full
exploitation of this potential demands a more complete understanding of Fc-mediated immune mechanisms in
humans and animal models. Rational design of prevention methods requires more information regarding
epitope targets, cognate polyclonal antibody (Ab) isotypes and subclasses, diverse FcR and effector cell
populations, and most important, how these elements can be pulled together for the greatest antiviral impact.
 The goal of this program is to define how Fc-mediated immunity can be used for preventing, treating,
curing HIV infection. We propose to determine the combined impact of antibody Fc and effector cells on
antiviral outcomes in situ, thus informing how antibody Fc effector functions can be used to improve antibody-
based vaccine strategies, increase the relative antiviral activity of HIV-1 specific antibody subclasses, and
augment bnAb- based prophylactic and therapeutic approaches. Our central hypothesis is that antibody
antiviral potency is maximal when multiple antibody specificities and subclasses are combined and that their
antiviral functions are modulated by the in vivo localization of FcR-bearing effector cells and host genetic
determinants of Fc-FcR engagement. Harnessing Fc function will improve bnAb vaccine strategies given the
need to increase the antiviral functions of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) at sub-efficacious levels. Toward this
end, we propose three synergistic, inter-related Projects supported by two Cores and an Administrative Core to
achieve the following Overall Aims:
1. Identify combinations of bnAb and nnAb antibody specificities with maximal antiviral activity.
2. Define the contribution of antibody Fc domain (subclass, allotype) on antiviral functions.
3. Determine FcR and effector cell populations responsible for maximal Ab Fc antiviral functions in
situ."
11159056,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Regulating when and where genes are expressed is essential to the proper development, health, and viability
of all living organisms. The processes that regulate gene expression are choreographed across a broad range
of spatial and temporal scales spanning from molecular scales where regulatory proteins bind and unbind DNA
at sub-second to second time scales, to the organization of the nucleus where proteins and DNA form dynamic
sub-micrometer sized domains that fluctuate over seconds and minutes, to the coordination of these events
across distinct tissue types over hours and across hundreds of micrometers to millimeters. Despite the dynamic
nature of these processes, most of our knowledge about them comes from experiments on fixed samples that
provide population and time-averaged data. Recently, the advent of high-resolution live imaging techniques have
granted the ability to quantify the dynamics of gene regulation and have highlighted what has been missed by
studies in fixed samples. Although these new imaging approaches have already provided remarkable insights,
due to technical constraints they are generally applied to cells grown on glass coverslips and isolated from the
tissue contexts in which they have evolved to function.
 The premise of this proposal is that in order to build a holistic and quantitative framework to understand gene
regulation, we must develop and apply experimental approaches that access the broad range of spatial and
temporal scales involved, and do so in endogenous contexts. To achieve this goal I propose to integrate cutting
edge light-sheet microscopy, label-free interferometry, and molecular imaging tools that will allow quantification
of single-molecule protein kinetics, transcriptional dynamics at individual gene loci, chromatin dynamics, and the
compartmentalization of nuclei in actively developing animal embryos. I will apply these technologies to study
the dynamics of gene regulation during early development in Drosophila Melanogaster embryos. These embryos
provide an ideal context for studying fundamental aspects of gene regulation. They proceed from fertilization to
differentiated tissue in around just 3 hours during which chromatin and nuclear organization is progressively
established along with patterns of gene expression across the embryo. I propose experiments that leverage the
new integrated technological approaches I will develop to ask: (1) How do the dynamics of transcription factor
protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions affect their ability to find and bind their specific genomic targets and
shape the nuclear environment? and (2) How are functional sub-nuclear compartments formed during embryonic
development, and what is their role in shaping chromatin dynamics and gene expression patterns?
 Together this proposal will lead to new experimental capabilities that will provide fundamental insights on the
dynamics of how gene expression is regulated from the molecular scale up to the organismal scale. These new
types of integrated datasets will lay the foundations for developing a quantitative and predictive framework which
may allow us to develop new therapeutic approaches for correcting aberrant gene expression in disease."

Four years ago the Michigan ADRC (MADRC) was established as a new consortium linking the three major
research universities in Michigan: University of Michigan, Michigan State University, and Wayne State
University. Serving the entire state of Michigan, the new MADRC achieved its milestones in wide-ranging
activities and research that emphasized a central theme: to identify, understand and treat the myriad non-Î²-
amyloid contributions to brain dysfunction and degeneration in Alzheimerâs disease and related dementias
(ADRD). With continued NIA support, the MADRC proposes to maintain this central theme because it captures
the diverse expertise of our dementia scientists, sheds light on ADRD heterogeneity, and reflects the
experience of the racially diverse pool of research participants engaged in MADRC-sponsored studies. To
achieve its objectives, the MADRC has four major aims: 1) Catalyze and perform research of the highest
impact in ADRD; 2) Promote regional efforts to understand, diagnose and treat the full spectrum of dementias
through collaborative scientific and outreach efforts; 3) Provide training and research opportunities for health
care professionals, scientists, and students in ADRD through innovative educational and mentoring programs;
and 4) Collaborate with other ADRCs, the NACC, NCRAD, and other multi-center efforts to lead the field in
developing new diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for these devastating diseases. The integrated efforts
of seven Cores, including new Neuroimaging and Biomarker cores, will support a wide range of basic, clinical,
translational and health disparities research advancing the field toward: improved understanding of disease
mechanisms; more precise disease identification across the dementia spectrum; development of novel
biomarkers; increased knowledge of the basis for health disparities that disproportionately affect Black
Americans; development of non-pharmacological therapies; and the identification and modification of disease
risks. The Research Education Component (REC) will serve as the centerpiece of innovative training
opportunities spanning all the Cores, and a new Leaders Initiative will support and promote a diverse group of
next-generation leaders in dementia research. Benefitting from the outstanding resources of all three
universities and strong multi-institutional support, the MADRC is poised to make new discoveries, educate the
public, and train next-generation leaders as we seek to achieve the milestones set forth in the National
Alzheimerâs Project Act."

PROJECT SUMMARY
With this application, we seek funding for the Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center
(IDDRC) at the Childrenâs Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), which
has been continuously funded for the past 30 years. Our IDDRC supports an interdisciplinary program and is the
chief agency at CHOP/Penn for the promulgation of research into the Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities
(IDDs). Our mission, to identify the pathogenesis of and develop therapies for individuals with IDDs, is pursued
through three aims. (Aim 1) Lead a cutting-edge IDD research agenda. We will support five research cores that
harness innovations in genetics and neuroscience to identify the causes of IDDs, to determine how gene variants
alter brain structure, circuitry, and behavioral outputs (cognitive, motor, sensory, social, affective), and to utilize
this information to develop biomarkers and new treatments for IDDs. Our cores deploy complementary state-of-
the-art technologies, focusing on studies performed in two species (mouse & human), making it easier for center
members to perform more impactful research. Cores emphasize research along the developmental spectrum.
These strategies ensure that the advances will have a translational impact. The cores provide cost-effective
support for 61 world-class center members, who are funded by 78 grants totaling $29.1 million annually to study
the pathogenesis of IDDs, to identify new biomarkers of IDDs, and to develop novel interventions (pharmacologic
and genetic). In addition, we will support an innovative research project that uses center cores to determine if
magnetoencephalography (MEG) measures of auditory processing in infants at genetic risk for IDD can be used
to predict cognitive and language outcome. Our cores focus on rigorous and reproducible research practices,
including sound experimental design for hypothesis testing, well-justified sample sizes, and robust data analytics.
(Aim 2) Lead a multi-disciplinary career development program to support trainees and early-stage faculty. Our
trainees are diverse and have PhDs, MDs, and MD/PhDs with backgrounds in genetics, neuroscience, and
related disciplines. They receive support from IDDRC-administered programs: a NINDS-funded T32 Training
Grant in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities, a CHOP Research institute-funded supplement program for clinical
research fellows, and a CHOP-institute funded New Program Development award for Assistant Professors. They
obtain multidisciplinary training that helps them become future leaders in IDD research. (Aim 3) Support
Networking/Collaboration, Advocacy, and the Dissemination of IDD Research findings. The Center leadership
will enable networking to support collaborative initiatives, both within the CHOP/Penn IDDRC community and
between IDDRCs. Center leadership will advocate both internally and externally to advance an IDD research
agenda. Finally, the Center will lead an effort to disseminate research advances to patients, their families, to
government officials, and to other scientists. With this comprehensive approach, the IDDRC at CHOP and Penn
will achieve our goal of advancing patient-centered innovative treatments for individuals with IDDs."

Congenital heart defects (CHDs) account for 1-2% of all live births in the U.S. More than 90% of these
diseases are attributed to defects in heart valves and septum; Of which, few have been modeled in mice likely
due to species differences and genetic complexities behind the disease. As an alternative approach, human
induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC), which has demonstrated great success in mimicking other diseases,
falls short in the modeling of CHDs, especially in regard to spatial sensitive mechanisms like those involved in
heart chamber development. However, with the emergence of organoids, the field is making significant strides
toward better CHD models. Currently, the limitations of using organoids resides in the structures integrity when
compared to the endogenous tissue, yet, the potential for CHD modelling is unmatched. Here I propose using
a novel method based on the organoid fusion principle to generate hearts with anatomically features:
chambers, valves and septum. To do this, we will first fuse one atrial and one ventricular organoid to create the
cardiac valves. Next, we will further extend this process to advance the formation of the valves and begin
formation of the septum by fusing two atrial and two ventricular organoids. Furthermore, we plan to use several
of our hiPSC lines either carrying CHD mutations or being directly reprogrammed from patients diagnosed with
CHDs to generate fused organoids that will allow us to model the disease progressions in patients. We
anticipate that the successful application of these techniques will offer significant improvements in modeling
the normal human heart development and congenital heart defects, with the ultimate goal of preventing and
treating congenital heart diseases."

Our modern food environment, with its widespread availability of energy-dense, palatable foods and associated
cues, is thought to interact with our physiology to promote food intake. This has contributed to the drastic increase
in obesity in the United States over the past several decades. However, most pharmacological weight loss
strategies target satiation pathways, not sensory pathways, and therefore may be less effective at eliminating
effects of environmental/sensory cues on food intake. Here we propose to take a novel approach to
understanding the drive to eat by examining the neural integration of sensory and nutritive food signals. First,
we will create sensory âengramsâ â functional maps of neurons activated by discrete sensory stimuli â and
determine how activating or inhibiting these circuits can influence food preference. This process will reveal the
power of leveraging âneural tastes,â âneural smells,â and âneural nutrientsâ â sensory experiences without
external sensory input â to shift feeding behavior. Next, we will monitor neural activity in awake, freely moving
mice to determine how neural activity in response to the sensory properties of food relates to individual
differences in feeding behavior and future weight gain. Finally, we will monitor calcium dynamics in individual
neurons to reveal the activity patterns that integrate sensory and nutritive information in the brain across different
body weights. Successful implementation of this proposal has the potential to enable an entirely new line of
research and development for weight loss therapeutics that targets neural circuits that integrate sensory and
nutritive properties of food. My track record of scientific innovation and productivity, combined with the
collaborative environment at the Monell Chemical Senses Center and Department of Neuroscience at the
University of Pennsylvania, makes me uniquely suited to bridge the fields of chemosensory biology, feeding
neurobiology, and obesity to execute a project of this ambition. Overall, this NIH Directorâs New Innovator Award
would launch my early career and provide the intellectual space to pursue innovative research that can redefine
the neural mechanisms that underlie overeating and obesity."
10930859,"The overall goal of the University of Minnesota (UMN) Udall Center is to develop novel, circuit based deep
brain stimulation (DBS) therapies for Parkinsonâs disease (PD) based on an understanding of the changes
in pathophysiological activity patterns that occur in basal ganglia thalamocortical-brainstem (BGTC-B) pathways.
Project 1 (human) will characterize the role of oscillatory activity, coupling and connectivity across the broader
BGTC network, including the subthalamic nucleus (STN), globus pallidus internus (GPi), sensory, motor,
premotor and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. These recordings will be performed at rest and during cognitive-
motor tasks, with and without therapeutic interventions (DBS, L-dopa, DBS+L-dopa). It will also clarify the relative
effect of stimulation in different functional subregions of the STN and GPi on motor and cognitive function.
Project 2 (human) will explore the mechanisms and effects of pallidal DBS on levodopa resistant motor signs
using MRI-derived computational models and fMRI to examine the pathways mediating these changes. It will
use new sensing technology (Percept) to identify and correlate the physiological changes in the GP to worsening
of, or improvement in, gait dysfunction. Project 3 (non-human primate) will examine the electrophysiological
changes in pallidoâpeduncular, pallidoâintralaminar, and pallidoâhabenular activity that are related to
cognitive-motor symptoms providing further network-level insights into cognitive motor gait impairments, task
shifting difficulties, and loss of motivation, which will complement the results from the human studies in Projects
1 and 2. All center components have synergistic interactions with the Catalyst Project, which will support
research efforts of a promising Early Stage Investigator who will use a novel closed-loop DBS approach to probe
circuit dynamics in PD patients and their relationship to PD motor signs. The Imaging Core will acquire state-
of-the-art, high-field structural MRI as well as rest and task-based fMRI for PD patients in Projects 1 and 2 (using
7T scanner) and structural MRI for the NHPs in Project 3 (using the first of its kind 10.5T scanner).The Clinical
Core will obtain clinical and quantitative motor and neuropsychological assessments that will be correlated to
physiological data obtained acutely in the operating room, subacutely in patients with externalized DBS leads
and electrocorticography arrays, and chronically through postoperative recordings using Percept. The
Biostatistics Core will provide overall data management, quality control, statistical and machine learning
analysis and data entry into the NINDS Data Management Resource. The Administrative Core will orchestrate
all aspects of the UMN Udall Center, implement and support patient education and public outreach efforts, and
develop and monitor individualized career enhancement plans for the next generation of PD researchers.
Together, these approaches will provide critical data towards the development and translation of novel patient-
specific DBS therapies."
10928754,"PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL
The overall goal of this Glioblastoma (GBM) Therapeutics Network (GTN) U19 application from City of Hope,
Translational Genomics Research Institute, and University of Alabama at Birmingham is to develop superior
treatments for patients with GBM, the most common and aggressive primary brain tumors in adults. Effective
treatments remain elusive and patients are rarely cured with standard therapies. This GTN U19 application
embodies a unique combination of approaches designed to significantly advance the treatment of patients with
GBM by addressing tumor heterogeneity, blood-brain barrier penetration, and the immunosuppressive GBM
tumor microenvironment. The three proposed research projects will translate therapeutic agents from preclinical
development, through IND-enabling studies, and into phase I clinical studies in adult patients with GBM. Each
project is based on novel molecular preclinical studies with small-molecule inhibitors and immunomodulatory
agents that use signature-guided assessment and treatments. Specific goals of the projects are:
 Project 1. Develop and clinically test an engineered oncolytic herpes virus expressing a full-
 length anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody for treatment of GBM.
 Project 2. Develop and clinically test tasquinimod as an adjunct to enhance the efficacy of
 anti-GBM immunotherapies administered peri-operatively.
 Project 3. Develop and clinically test a molecular âsignatures of vulnerabilityâ guided treatment
 of GBM with neddylation inhibitor pevonedistat.
In addition, this U19 application proposes strategies that will address major barriers in drug development by
incorporating two innovative research tools: 1) intracerebral microdialysis to rationally select appropriate
systemically administered therapies for testing in GBM patients and 2) next generation exome and transcriptome
sequencing to identify molecular âsignatures of vulnerabilityâ that can guide appropriate patient selection for
clinical trial enrollment. These analytical capabilities will enable us to quantify CNS drug penetration and dissect
genomic heterogeneity in tumor and stromal cells in the proposed clinical trials. Also, two of the proposed projects
leverage City of Hopeâs GMP facilities to manufacture biological agents and small molecules that will be tested
in adult GBM patients for the first time.
In summary, the innovative projects and shared resources cores in this application combine our strengths in
basic, translational, and clinical research in a highly collaborative setting that promotes the sharing of ideas,
results, resources, and clinical populations to develop effective treatments for GBM. If successful, data generated
by these studies have the potential to transform the treatment of adult GBM patients by introducing new agents
that circumvent tumor heterogeneity and immunosuppression."
10533273,"Project Summary/Abstract
 We have recently performed a vaccine trial using Mamu-B*17+ Indian rhesus macaques, which
demonstrated remarkable control of chronic phase viral replication in five ârapid controllerâ animals.
Control correlated with the development of increased endpoint titers of vaccine-induced anti-gp140
binding antibodies (Abs) on day of challenge. These Abs did not neutralize the simian
immunodeficiency virus mac239 (SIVmac239) clone. We have rarely seen this type of stringent control of
SIVmac239 replication in more than 130 intrarectally (IR)-challenged macaques with the same dose of this
stock of SIVmac239. In Specific Aim I, we will investigate whether the vaccine-induced Env-binding Abs
in the Mamu-B*17+ ârapid controllerâ animals either had direct anti-viral effects or facilitated the
development of efficacious T-cell responses. We will address this hypothesis by utilizing two different
approaches involving transfer of serum IgG and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from the ârapid
controllerâ animals to vaccinated and naÃ¯ve animals.
 We will also investigate the nature of control in Mamu-B*08+ Indian rhesus macaques. More than 50%
of naÃ¯ve (no vaccine or drug treatment) Mamu-B*08+ macaques become âelite controllersâ (ECs) after
infection with SIVmac239. In Specific Aim II, we will determine the genes involved in the control of the
innate immune response that influence the development of elite control in macaques that express
Mamu-B*08.
 It is becoming increasingly apparent that classical vaccine-induced CD8+ T-cells by themselves will
not be sufficient to either prevent or control human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or SIV infection. Recent
studies have suggested that in conjunction with other effector molecules (Abs, innate immune responses)
CD8+ T-cells can function effectively in the control of HIV/SIV replication in vaccinated individuals. Our
studies plan to elucidate these mechanisms in two cohorts of macaques where unusual control of SIV
replication has been observed."
10793465,"Abstract
Rabies disease is nearly 100% lethal in the absence of treatment, killing an estimated 59,000 people annually.
When vaccines are properly administered, they are highly efficacious, making them one of the most economically
high-impact interventions among infectious diseases. About 30,000 people receive post-exposure treatment in
the USA annually indicating the need for treatment options against RABV. Of note, fifteen rabies-related viruses
(lyssaviruses) are similarly lethal, but divergent enough to evade protection from current vaccines and biologics,
which are based on the classical rabies virus (RABV).
We previously designed a structurally-informed chimeric glycoprotein (G) to incorporate large ectodomain
regions of two divergent lyssaviruses, RABV and Mokola virus (MOKV). In vivo, this vaccine elicited neutralizing
antibodies against both RABV and MOKV and protected against challenge with viruses containing MOK G or
RABV G. Based on knowledge of the RABV G, these preliminary data suggest that i) the chimeric G includes
important antigenic regions from both RABV and MOKV and that ii) the elicited antibodies should protect against
challenge. Moreover, some data also raised the compelling suggestion that antibody mechanisms in addition to
neutralization may contribute to protection.
Three independent but complementary aims are proposed to take the discoveries of the R21 to the next level.
The first Aim will investigate the immunogenicity and protective quality of a chimeric G lyssavirus vaccine against
a panel of different lyssaviruses of importance. Aim 2 examines antigenic regions of non-RABV lyssavirus
glycoproteins (G) and delineate the antigenic regions on the lyssavirus Gs by isolating and characterizing
neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The dogma for protection against RABV is that neutralizing
antibodies are necessary and sufficient. This has not been studies for non-RABV lyssaviruses and is not
completely supported by preliminary data from our previous study. Therefore, Aim 3 will revisit the mechanism
of protection against Lyssaviruses in pre- and post-exposure applications and redefine the function of
neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies for protection from rabies."
10891694,"Overall Research Plan Project Summary. Significance. Data science hold great promise for sub-Saharan
Africa, yet research capacity and appropriate training are limited. Medical images are particularly exciting for
data science in this setting given their ability to facilitate care delivery across healthcare cadres. Efforts to
translate the knowledge gained through data science into improved clinical care can be fostered through
implementation science. Strategic multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional partnerships will be key for the
development and ultimate impact of data science for African-based solutions. Innovation. This proposal is
innovative in 1) its use of data science with medical images for advancing clinical care, and 2) integration of
data science with implementation science to promote clinical impact. Approach. The Mbarara University Data
Science Research Hub (MUDSReH) in Uganda will use multiple technologies to improve the capture of
medical images and employ key data science methods, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, to
expand their utilization in sub-Saharan Africa. Clinical impact will be strengthened through implementation
science methods. Formal training will be available for both data science and implementation science, and
ongoing expansion of efforts will be promoted through regional summits and collaboration. The two initial
research projectsâoptimized posterior fundus imaging to diagnose posterior segment eye disease and mobile-
phone based cervical images to detect cancerâwill involve partnerships with the College of Ophthalmologists
of Eastern, Central and Southern Africa in Kenya and the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and
Technology in Ghana, respectively. Massachusetts Institute of Technology will provide technical support for
data management and analysis, and Massachusetts General Hospital will support the use of implementation
science and other relevant content areas for individual research projects. Each project will work with local
Ministries of Health, community-based organizations, and/or technology partners to advance the mission of
harnessing medical images for improved clinical outcomes and impact. Our specific aims are as follows:
 1. To integrate all partnering academic institutions, technology companies, and non-governmental
 organizations to advance data science for medical imaging. All partners will contribute to a common
 infrastructure for data processing and analysis. We will establish both the administrative and technical
 mechanisms for data exchange, accounting for necessary data security and quality assurance and control.
 We will further create pathways for facile expansion to include additional research projects involving
 medical imaging (e.g., in radiology and dermatology) at multiple African institutions.
 2. To integrate implementation science with data science to advance clinical impact. All research
 projects in the MUDSReH will include implementation science methodologies to ensure the developed
 technology reaches the end user in practical ways that meet local needs and priorities."

The major goal of the UAB Public Health/Biomedical Research Training Program (UAB MHRT) is to train and
promote the professional development and participation of underrepresented minority students in biomedical
and behavioral research both in the U.S. and abroad. This will contribute to the cadre of researchers engaged
in reducing health disparities in populations. The program will recruit and train 5 undergraduate (juniors and
seniors), 3 masters (research degree) and 2 PhD students annually for five years. Each trainee will be
matched with a research project at UAB or at a collaborative site in one of the four countries: Institute for
Nutrition of Central America and Panama (INCAP), Guatemala City, Guatemala; Western Regional Health
Authority, Ministry of Health, Jamaica; Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH) Lima, Peru and the
Nepal Fertility and Care Center, Kathmandu Nepal. Trainees going to a foreign site will receive pre-departure
training and post-training follow-up from UAB Faculty Mentors. Pre-departure training will include training in
research ethics, cultural orientation and scientific methods such as experimental design, data collection and
analysis and use of data software. UAB masters and doctoral students will receive training in research ethics,
scientific methods, experimental design, data collection and analysis and will be closely guided by a UAB
mentor. Research areas include infectious diseases (HIV, STIs, TB, HPV), maternal and child health, nutrition,
chronic and cardio-metabolic diseases (diabetes, hypertension, cancer), and health care service delivery. Each
trainee will perform research and collect and manage data under the guidance of one or more UAB mentor(s)
for students conducting research in the U.S., and a UAB and a Foreign Mentor for students conducting
research at a foreign site. Trainees are required to write a final paper based on their project data under
guidance from the UAB and foreign mentors that can be submitted for presentation at a national or
international conference and for publication. The program is budgeted to cover travel, living and research
expenses for trainees as applicable, and provide each trainee with a monthly stipend based on the NRSA
levels. UAB Faculty Mentors may travel to the foreign site annually, and two Foreign Mentors may visit UAB for
collaborative work annually. The program will be evaluated annually for achievement of the specific objectives
and overall effectiveness."
10531866,"Project Summary/Abstract
Among head and neck cancer (HNC) patients, 92% report fatigue and 73% have pain. A 10% increase in
fatigue or pain is associated with a 10-25% reduction in HNC survival. During the critical transition period from
the end of active treatment to 3 months post-treatment (during which patients begin symptom self-
management), untreated physical symptoms negatively impact functional status (ADL) and quality of life
(QOL). Fatigue and musculoskeletal pain (related to tissue damage from surgery and radiation) are known to
improve in response to physical activity (PA). However, 51% of HNC survivors rarely engage in any type of PA
because of complicated PA barriers: impaired fitness, severe physical symptoms, and poor PA health beliefs.
A critical gap in our science is that no home-based behavioral PA intervention effectively addresses these PA
barriers in HNC patients. To address this gap, our overall objective is to test an intervention to overcome these
PA barriers for HNC patients during the critical transition period to self-management. PAfitME, a personalized
Physical Activity intervention with fitness graded Motion Exergames, is a telehealth program built on Social
Cognitive Theory and the exercise principal of adaptation. PAfitME is personalized to the HNC patient's PA
barriers. PAfitME, delivered via a tested mix of FaceTime calls and home visits, uses commercially available
exergaming platforms (Wii Fit and Xbox Kinect). Our pilot study generated impressive within-group effect sizes
for fatigue, pain, and ADL (dâ¥0.9). The feasibility and acceptability of PAfitME were also strong in patients with
several physical limitations. Attendance (98%) and attrition (20%) were much better than previous HNC studies
without adverse events. We propose the following specific aims: (1) When compared to an attention control
group, determine the effect of PAfitME on fatigue and musculoskeletal pain at week 6, when controlling for age
and sex; (2) when compared to an attention control group, determine the effect of PAfitME on functional status
and QOL at week 6, when controlling for age and sex; and (3) explore if PA self-efficacy, PA enjoyment, and
exergame minutes mediate the effect of PAfitME on fatigue and musculoskeletal pain. This study will evaluate
150 post-treatment (radiation or chemoradiation) HNC patients in an RCT with an attention control. For 6
weeks, the experimental (PAfitME) group will receive the PAfitME intervention, and the attention control group
will receive NCI-based survivorship education and exergame equipment (Wii Fit or Xbox Kinect without
PAfitME). For Aims 1 and 2, using an ITT framework, we will fit a series of linear mixed effects models with
each of the outcome variables. For Aim 3, we will conduct our exploratory analyses in ml_mediation (STATA
15), which will compute direct and indirect effects for multi-level data. This study aligns with the NCI Cancer
Moonshot goal to minimize cancer treatment-associated side effects and the key recommendation in the
National Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Guidelines of the need for evidence-based non-
pharmacological fatigue/pain treatments (National Priority)."
10531255,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Work requirements are becoming increasingly common in major public assistance
programs, and starting in 2018, several states have received approval from the federal
government to require employment or other qualifying âcommunity engagement activitiesâ to
obtain Medicaid coverage. Proponents of work requirements contend that these policies
increase beneficiary engagement in work and community activities that may lead to higher
incomes and better health. On the other hand, opponents of work requirements suggest that
many low-resource households will lose much-needed benefits, without commensurate
improvements in employment. More than a dozen states have proposed new Medicaid work
requirements in the past year, but there is little rigorous evidence on the effects of these policies
in public programs. We propose a randomized controlled trial of work requirements in Virginia,
leveraging state support for exempting a portion of Medicaid expansion enrollees from the
state's impending work requirements. We will be able to separate the causal impact of enforcing
a work requirement from two other new features of Virginia's Medicaid program: additional
verification requirements and premiums. Our experimental design will enable us to test for any
interactions between work requirements, premiums, and verification requirements. We will study
the impacts of each policy on health insurance coverage, access to care, employment, and
health outcomes using a mix of administrative data and a new beneficiary survey, and we will
oversample several populations of interest, including racial/ethnic minorities and low-income
rural residents. In doing so, we will identify the overall policy impacts of these policies, and we
will also assess who is most affected by each component to determine the impact of these
Medicaid policy changes on racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic disparities."
10892747,"HE2AT Center Overall - Project summary/abstract
The world's climate is changing rapidly, with global temperatures having risen more than 1Â°C since the
industrial revolution, and a further 0.5Â°C increase is likely by 2040. Heat waves and rising temperatures have
major, though underappreciated, health implications, particularly for vulnerable populations in low-income
settings. The overarching objective of the Heat and Health African Transdisciplinary Center (HE2AT Center) is
to develop innovative solutions to mitigate the health impacts of climate change in Africa. The consortium of
academic and non-academic partners is drawn from across sub-Saharan Africa and from the United States,
and constitutes a transdisciplinary group, including heat physiologists, biomedical and climate content experts,
public health practitioners, social-behavioral scientists as well as statisticians, and computer and data
scientists. The Center will systematically develop a data ecosystem containing biomedical data, integrated with
weather, air quality and other environmental data, and other geospatial data within two existing highly-
complementary data platforms (IBM-PAIRS and the University of Cape Town). Over five years we will
implement two Research Projects and 10-12 Pilot Projects, all streamlined and supported by the
Administration, Data Management and Analysis, and Training and Engagement Cores. The first Project will
implement an innovative data science approach to characterize the clinical outcomes of heat exposure in
pregnant women and neonates. We will reuse data from cohorts and trials among pregnant women and
neonates conducted across sub-Saharan Africa since the year 2000. Data from systematically identified
studies will be integrated in an Individual Participant Data platform from data repositories and data owners.
Then, analyses of relationships between heat exposure and outcomes (preterm birth, birth weight and pre-
eclampsia) will inform quantification of heat-related disease burden. Finally, taking all findings together, we will
pilot a district-level climate change indicator, the first of its kind. The second Project assesses the burden of
heat-related morbidity in vulnerable urban settings using geospatial and heat hazard analyses in Abidjan, Cote
d'Ivoire and Johannesburg, South Africa. This Project uses more complex data and data sources on the built
environment and topography, for example, to assess heat-health impacts, and how these vary across urban
geographies. Activities will inform development of an Early Warning System, including a digital App that
delivers information to people on their forecasted risks of heat-health disease, based on their individualized risk
profile, as determined by a machine learning algorithm which takes into account weather conditions, individual
characteristics, geolocation and other factors that drive risk. These systems are a central element in heatwave
responses, allow for adequate preparations for heat events, which is especially important for vulnerable groups
and industry. We will collaborate closely with other Hubs and parts of the DS-I Africa consortium, supporting
them to incorporate climate data within their research activities, and vice versa."

 Brain cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in patients age 0-19. Diffuse intrinsic pontine
glioma (DIPG) has a median overall survival (OS) of approximately 8 months. High grade glioma (HGG) is
similarly devastating, with a median OS of 16 months, and recurrent medulloblastoma (MB) has an OS of
approximately 12 months. We and others have found that cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigens are present in MB
and HGG/DIPG but not in healthy brain tissue. Human CMV nucleic acids and protein epitopes in found in 70-
100% of HGG/DIPG and 92% of medulloblastoma. Given the prevalence of CMV antigen expression in
HGG/DIPG and medulloblastoma, targeting CMV antigens through peptide vaccination represents a novel
treatment to selectively kill tumor while leaving normal tissue unharmed.
 Our group has developed a peptide vaccine (PEP-CMV) directed to the CMV antigen, pp65, in children and
young adults that is being evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial (NCT03299309). Our preliminary results in 17
patients have shown that there have been no â¥ 3 Grade toxicities and that vaccines elicited immune responses
in 75% of patients. In this multiply recurrent cohort of patients, six of 11patients who received at least three
vaccines demonstrated stable disease or partial responses on MRI. Given this data, our hypothesis is that
treatment of children with a newly diagnosed HGG and DIPG or recurrent MB using the PEP-CMV vaccine will
generate a robust immune response resulting in improved PFS and OS compared to historical controls.
Our Primary Objectives are: 1) to determine the objective response rate to PEP-CMV in patients with
recurrent MB, 2) to determine the progression-free survival at 4 months in patients with recurrent MB, 3) to
determine 1 year OS in patients with newly-diagnosed DIPG, and 4) to determine 1 year PFS in patients with
newly diagnosed HGG. Our Secondary Objectives are: 1) to further define treatment related toxicities of this
regimen and 2) to determine 1 year PFS in patients with recurrent MB and 2 year OS in HGG. Our Exploratory
objectives are 1) to describe and quantify the immune response to PEP-CMV and 2) to estimate the vascularity
and permeability of tumors in response to PEP-CMV using perfusion MRI to better differentiate tumor
progression from pseudoprogression. To attain the overall objectives, the following specific aims will be
pursued. Aim 1: Conduct a multi-institutional trial to assess the PFS and OS of children and young adults with
newly diagnosed HGG, newly diagnosed DIPG, and recurrent MB who receive PEP-CMV. Aim 2: Determine
the immunogenicity and radiographic responses of patients who receive PEP-CMV.
 This study is impactful because it has the potential to cause a paradigm shift in the way malignant pediatric
brain tumors are treated, using a novel immunotherapeutic vaccine approach in lieu of toxic radiation and
chemotherapy."

our MPRINT CET is accomplished through 3 Projects (Clinical, Basic Science and Data Science) an
Administrative Core and two Technology Cores, the Milk Analytics Core (MAC) and Pharmacometrics and
Analytical Chemistry Core (PACC). In the Clinical Project âAntibiotic Treatment in Breastfeeding Mothers: Effects
on Milk, Microbiome, and Infant Outcomesâ, we have proven expertise and infrastructure and access to a high
enrolling maternal-infant clinical cohort to study how maternal antibiotics alter breast milk composition and
impact infant outcomes in clinical meaningful ways. In the Basic Science Project âThe Impact of Ampicillin and
Breast Milk Oligosaccharides on the Infant Microbiome and Immune Functionsâ, we leverage extensive
experience in mouse models of neonatal host-pathogen interactions to probe functional effects of ampicillin and
MMOs on infant immune function, including a novel cross-fostering strategy with wild-type and MMO-deficient
mothers. In our Data Science Project âImpact of Maternal Antibiotics on the Breastfeeding Infant Microbiome and
Metabolomeâ, we deploy advanced MS technology, non-invasive sampling and innovative molecular networking
analytics in a cutting-edge study of the impact of breast milk antibiotic exposure on the infant microbiome,
metabolome and hepatic Cyp enzymes. The MAC provides milk collection protocols and kits, near infrared
spectroscopy and HPLC, HMO/MMO and nutritional composition analysis, and new assay validation expanding
our MPRINT CET analytical capabilities, while the PAC develops and validates novel quantitative assays and
physiologic and semi-physiologic models to describe and predict maternal and infant antibiotic PK during
breastfeeding. Our Administrative Core oversees integration and performance of our research projects/cores
and their milestones, connecting them to the national MPRINT CET HUB and unique training/pilot projects."
10529299,"Abstract
Compelling evidence has implicated human gut microbiota in development of obesity and related
cardiometabolic disorders. Recent studies identified a group of circulating metabolites that are functionally
related to gut microbiota. These microbial metabolites act as âtransducersâ in the microbiota-host
communications and âsensorsâ in gut-organ/tissue crosstalk, and affect ectopic fat distribution in various
metabolic organs and tissues. Diet is among the most important regulators of gut microbiota; however, no
study has assessed how weight-loss diets may affect the long-term changes of the newly identified microbial
metabolites. The proposed systems study aims to fill this significant research gap. In two of the longest and
largest comparator trials on the popular weight-loss diets - POUNDS LOST and CENTRAL, we propose to
identify novel plasma microbial metabolites associated with long-term weight loss in response to diet
interventions. We will examine relations of plasma levels of identified microbial metabolites and ectopic fat
distribution in the liver, heart, pancreas, and kidney, as well as adipose and skeletal muscle tissues. In addition,
we will assess whether changes in plasma microbial metabolites mediate the relations between weight loss
and changes in cardiometabolic markers. Moreover, we will examine the dynamic associations between
microbial metabolites and changes in plasma miRNAs related to obesity and cardiometabolic risk. The findings
from our study will considerably improve development of novel prevention and treatment strategies for obesity
and related cardiometabolic disorders."

awareness of the critical need for more reliable, effective, and accessible means to recognize those in need,
direct them to help, and ensure that they receive the best treatment available. Research has suggested that
people are most responsive to advice and education when it comes from someone to whom they can relate.
AboutFace is a peer education resource for Veterans that was developed, launched, and recently updated
by the National Center for PTSD (NCPTSD) based on HSR&D funded pilot data. AboutFace features
personal stories of Veterans and is designed to improve mental health treatment engagement among
Veterans with PTSD and related comorbidities. The study team, which includes the NCPTSD, recently
completed a usability assessment and pilot feasibility trial of AboutFace under HSR&D grant #PPO 14-360-
1. Data from this study (1) guided improvements to AboutFace for increasing PTSD treatment initiation and
engagement; and (2) demonstrated the feasibility of the methodology for the proposed study. If AboutFace
is found to increase Veteransâ initiation and engagement in PTSD treatment, study data will have broad
implications for overcoming barriers to care for Veterans with PTSD and other stigmatized conditions.
Background: At least 1 in 10 Veterans meet criteria for PTSD related to their military experience. Treatment
for PTSD is widely available, and national dissemination initiatives have increased Veteransâ access to best-
practice interventions. However, treatment-seeking remains strikingly low; most Veterans with PTSD do not
seek mental health services due to perceived stigma and other barriers. NCPTSD developed and launched
AboutFace, a public awareness campaign to help Veterans recognize PTSD and motivate them to seek
evidence-based care. Since its development, AboutFace has earned three major awards and has had tens
of thousands of visits. Despite the tremendous potential for AboutFace to reduce stigma, improve attitudes
toward mental health treatment seeking, and to increase PTSD treatment initiation and engagement, it has
yet to be formally evaluated or effectively implemented within VHA practice settings. In addition to providing
needed data on the efficacy of AboutFace and identifying strategies for effective implementation within VHA,
this study will provide a greater understanding of the role and value of digital storytelling interventions to
improve access to care for a wide range of stigmatized conditions.
Objectives: The primary objectives of the study are to examine the impact of AboutFace on a) increasing
PTSD treatment initiation and engagement; and b) decreasing stigma and negative attitudes toward mental
health services. It is anticipated that Veterans in the AboutFace condition will be more likely to access and
complete treatment than those receiving enhanced Usual Care (eUC) for PTSD. Finally, qualitative
interviews with key stakeholders across the nation will be conducted to inform best practices for future
implementation of AboutFace.
Methods: A total of 376 Veterans referred for a PTSD assessment and recommended for treatment in the
Charleston PTSD clinic will be enrolled in the study. Veterans will be randomized to receive AboutFace
versus eUC. All Veterans will receive standard PTSD educational materials, and half will also be randomly
assigned to receive AboutFace. Comparisons will be made across indices of treatment engagement [i.e.,
initiated treatment (yes/no), total number of sessions completed;]; changes in stigma and attitudes toward
seeking mental health treatment; and changes in PTSD symptoms and quality of life. Veterans will be
assessed on these indices at baseline, 1-month, 3-month, and 6-months. Thematic interviews will be
conducted with 20-30 VA PTSD Clinical Team Directors from a diverse range of PTSD clinics (i.e., ranging
in size, location, and practice) to inform future implementation and dissemination initiatives."

10538573,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is a major global epidemic and poses a particular threat to HIV-infected
individuals. With few effective drugs available for treatment, multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant (M/XDR)
TB carry a high mortality rate and threaten global TB and HIV control efforts. M/XDR TB treatment is long (18-
24 months) and associated with serious side effects. As a result, 10-25% of patients prematurely interrupt
therapy, placing them at increased risk for treatment failure, acquisition of additional resistance, and death.
 New and repurposed medications have recently been found to improve survival and cure rates.
Bedaquiline, the first new TB drug in 40 years, and clofazimineâa drug primarily used for leprosyâhave been
at the center of this treatment revolution. In 2018, WHO recommended that all MDR and XDR TB treatment
regimens include bedaquiline and clofazimine. Bedaquiline, however, has an extremely long half-life (5.5
months). Patients who interrupt therapy are likely exposed to bedaquiline monotherapy as companion drugs
are more rapidly eliminatedâplacing them at high risk of developing bedaquiline resistance. Clofazimine,
which has a half-life of 70 days, may protect against resistance as a companion drug, but cross-resistance
between bedaquiline and clofazimine may develop. Given the high frequency of treatment interruption, there is
danger that as bedaquiline and clofazimine are scaled up worldwide, resistance may become widespread.
 In the proposed study, we seek to understand the complex interplay of bedaquiline and clofazimineâs
pharmacokinetics (PK) on the risk of resistance during treatment interruption. We will enroll MDR and XDR TB
patients who have returned to care after interrupting a bedaquiline- and clofazimine-containing regimen. In Aim
1, we will characterize the presence of phenotypic and genotypic drug resistance to bedaquiline and
clofazimine to examine how the duration of interruption affects the risk of resistance. In Aim 2, we will measure
plasma concentrations of bedaquiline and clofazimine and intracellular bedaquiline concentrations after
treatment interruption. We will use population PK modeling to understand the pharmacokinetics of these drugs
during interruption and determine the concentrations associated with phenotypic or genotypic resistance. In
Aim 3, we will use a novel, deep sequencing assay to identify minority resistant subpopulations (i.e.,
microheteroresistance) which are not detectable by phenotypic testing or whole genome sequencing. We will
follow subjects for 6 months to determine if heteroresistance predicts treatment failure or acquired resistance.
 South Africa has among the highest global burden of drug-resistant TB and HIV and has initiated >21,000
patients on bedaquiline to date. The aims of this study will answer fundamental questions about bedaquiline
and clofazimine pharmacology and resistance that will directly inform their use in South Africa and worldwide.
Our study will draw from the largest bedaquiline treatment program in the world and addresses research
priorities outlined by the NIH and the US Federal TB Task Force."
11001046,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), represents a severe world health
crisis (4,000 TB deaths daily). A better understanding of Mtb biology and pathogenesis will drive development
of novel strategies to control the TB epidemic. In bacterial pathogens, like Mtb, many proteins are exported to
the bacterial cell envelope or the extracellular environment in order to carry out critical functions in bacterial
physiology, virulence or immune responses. Thus, Mtb pathways that export proteins could be targeted or
exploited for the development of novel anti-TB control measures. However, significant gaps exist in our
understanding of Mtb protein export.
 This proposal is to determine the mechanism of SatS, a novel protein export chaperone we discovered
in Mtb. SatS is a chaperone for a subset of proteins that are exported by the specialized SecA2 protein export
pathway, and SatS is required for intracellular growth of Mtb in macrophages. However, SatS shares no
sequence or structural similarity with any previously characterized proteins and the mechanism of SatS is
completely unknown. Substrate specificity and the scope of SatS substrates are also unknown. Aim 1 of this
proposal is to determine the mechanistic details of SatS function in protein export. Aim 2 is to determine the
structures of SatS and that of SatS in complex with peptides of substrates. Aim 3 is to identify SatS-binding
sites in substrates and to identify additional SatS substrates. By completing these Aims, we will determine the
mechanism and contribution of SatS to Mtb protein export and biology. More broadly, these studies will
improve our understanding of bacterial strategies for exporting proteins and of the diversity of molecular
chaperones across biological systems. Long-term, the results could lead to strategies for inhibiting protein
export as a novel anti-TB therapy. Alternatively, the knowledge gained could be harnessed to engineer
mycobacterial strains with improved capacity to export proteins for use as experimental tools or as live,
attenuated vaccines with enhanced antigen export."
10831825,"Background: VA needs to incorporate the Veteran and family voice in measuring performance, and it may
improve care to involve Veterans and families more deeply in improvement. This is especially true for
palliative and end of life care, given the 30% of lifetime Medicare costs in the last year of life, and the
divergent perspectives that Americans have expressed regarding end of life care. We have identified major
gaps in VA performance, but work is needed to prioritize indicators from the Veteran and family
perspective and to improve measure feasibility. The latter will foster better VA quality and experience of
care and facilitate monitoring the potential impact of paid, non-VA care on seriously ill Veterans.
Aims: The Improving Palliative Measurement Application with Computer-Assisted-Abstraction Study
(ImPACS), will prioritize measures and operationalize a subset of higher, intermediate, and lower feasibility
process and utilization measures for palliative and end of life cancer care. We aim to:
Aim 1: Solicit priorities from two Delphi panels - one of Veterans and families and a second of experts
regarding process and healthcare use quality measures for advanced cancer care, including which of the
42 Cancer Quality ASSIST measures to extract, and conduct interviews regarding how to integrate
Veterans and families in VA measurement and improvement for palliative and end of life cancer care, and
Aim 2: Extract high priority process and utilization measures using natural language processing of VA
charts and administrative data and in a sample drawn from Stanford and Dana Farberâs Healthcare's
Epic systems, focusing on the domains of pain and opioids, mental health, and goals of care
communication, and
Aim 3: Examine associations of the extracted measures with Veteran characteristics, focusing on
disparities in the care of rural and nonwhite Veterans and palliative care use.
Methods: For Aim 1, we will recruit two Delphi panels - one of Veterans, family members, and a second of
expert stakeholders. Veteran-family members will have experience with cancer. Experts will have expertise
in the methods and application of quality measures. Purposive sampling will focus on critical attributes
(e.g., race) that may affect priorities. Panelists will rate and rank measures within tiers of high,
intermediate, and low feasibility, informed by reviews of the evidence for intervention and impact of
performance gaps on patients and caregivers. We will also interview Veterans, family members and VA
leaders at high and low performing VA facilities based on the Bereaved Family Survey of end of life
experience, to see how deeper Veterans-family involvement might strengthen quality and experience of
end of life care. For Aim 2, we will operationalize a subset of prioritized process measures from Aim 1
including Cancer Quality ASSIST measures using natural language processing of text notes and machine
learning. In Aim 3, we will characterize variation in measures with Veteran characteristics focusing on
known disparities among rural and nonwhite Veterans and palliative care services use.
Impact: We will produce Veteran and family-informed priorities for a balanced measure set for palliative
and end of life cancer care. We will inform how Veterans and families might be more deeply engaged in
fostering improved quality and experience and fostering a learning healthcare system. Finally, we will
extract prioritized measures using state of the art methods to improve their feasibility, characterize
variation at the Veteran level focused on known disparities and palliative care potential to mitigate them."
10883911,"Abstract
 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by progressive changes in neural circuits that culminate in memory
loss, confusion, difficulty completing tasks, withdrawal, mood changes and ultimately death. Alterations in body
movement â such as slowed gait, and difficulty in avoiding obstacles â have been associated with AD, are
predictive of AD, and often appear in the pre-clinical stage, before cognitive changes are apparent. These
observations raise important questions about how AD targets the cognitive and motor systems that support
movement and/or action selection; addressing these questions in turn requires a clear view of how AD
pathophysiology influences behavior both early and late in disease, and particularly how these changes in
behavior are distinguished from the many motor-related changes apparent during normal aging. However, to
date behavioral analysis of movement in AD mouse models have not yet yielded a clear and consistent view of
how AD affects the neural circuits responsible for selecting, composing, sequencing and implementing ongoing
behaviors. At least in part this failure reflects the methods used to characterize behavior in mouse models,
which depend upon a set of reductionist assays that capture limited aspects of a mouse's overall behavioral
comportment within a given experiment; as a consequence we do not know whether different AD models share
core movement phenotypes, nor do we understand whether or how AD targets the cortico-striatal circuits that
create the coherent, moment-to-moment patterns of action used by mice to interact with the world. Our
laboratory has recently developed a novel behavioral characterization technique, based upon 3D machine
vision and unsupervised machine learning techniques, called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq). MoSeq
automatically and without human supervision identifies the behavioral modules (âsyllablesâ e.g., a left turn, the
first half of a rear, etc.) out of which spontaneous and self-directed behavior is composed, as well as the
statistical rules governing the sequencing of these syllables (âgrammarâ). We have previously demonstrated
that the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) contains explicit neural correlates for both syllables and grammar, and that
the DLS is causally required to assemble syllables into meaningful and adaptive sequences. Here we propose
to use MoSeq to characterize behavioral phenotypes expressed by a variety of AD mouse models, to perform
joint neural-behavioral recordings to probe circuit mechanisms that underlie these observed phenotypes and,
finally, to develop MoSeq into a broadly-applicable platform for studying the movement-related signatures of
cognition. Taken together, these experiments promise to revitalize the study of behavior and neuro-behavioral
relationships in pre-clinical models of AD, and to reveal key mechanisms that tie together AD-related genetic
lesions, neural circuit function, and ongoing naturalistic patterns of action."

Endometriosis is a chronic, debilitating estrogen-dependent disease wherein tissue similar to the uterine lining
(endometrium) is found mainly on pelvic tissues and organs where it causes an inflammatory response, scarring,
pelvic pain, and infertility. It affects millions of reproductive age women and severely impacts quality of life and
professional life, and has a huge health economic impact of about $69B annually in the U.S. While its etiology is
uncertain, profound dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immune systems is associated with inefficient lesion
clearance and pelvic and systemic inflammation. The heterogeneity of endometriosis lesions and disease
phenotypes is reflected in variable pain symptom presentations, unpredictable fertility potential, uncertain
disease pathophysiology, and unpredictable responses to medical therapies, symptom and disease recurrence
after surgical resection, and risks for co-morbidities. Clinical classifications of endometriosis are maladapted to
the heterogeneity of disease expression, and thus efficient treatments for associated pain symptoms are lacking.
Herein, our UCSF Stanford Endometriosis Center for Discovery, Innovation, Training and Community
Engagement (âENACTâ) proposes a comprehensive systems biology and precision medicine approach to
endometriosis. We propose to study endometriosis unmet needs and challenges through transdisciplinary
collaboration and scientific and technologic innovations, integrating multi-omics data to dissect endometriosis
disease mechanisms, identify phenotypic and environmental disease signatures, develop accurate disease
stratification and diagnosis, and identify novel and repurposed drug classes to ameliorate pain symptoms. To
achieve these goals, our Center is comprised of 3 independent and interactive projects and 2 Cores, focused on
the central theme of Endometriosis Precision Medicine. Project 1 will focus on underlying immunological
mechanisms in endometriosis pathogenesis and pathophysiology. Project 2 will address developing a multi-
omic disease classification that will inform diagnostic strategies, and Project 3 will leverage existing and newly
generated large-scale omic data to identify and validate new therapeutic interventions. Our long-standing Human
Endometrial Tissue and DNA Bank and REDCap database and ongoing accruals with our collaborating network
of surgeons will be a major resource for this Center's project. The Center will have an Administrative Core and an
Education and Community Outreach Core that will engage students from the Bay Area in our research programs
and empower women in our community and address health disparities associated with endometriosis. To achieve
these goals, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of investigators at UCSF and Stanford University, many
of whom are new to endometriosis research, as well as educators, trainees, and community representatives who
are all committed to improve the lives of women and teen girls with endometriosis. Integrating multiple disciplines,
fostering collaborations among those who are new to endometriosis, training the next generation and partnering
with our community are key to the outcomes and impact of our Endometriosis Center."
10889039,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A key problem in Africa is the paucity of population-scale epidemiologic data sources and analytical capacity to
rapidly identify and understand infectious disease pandemics. Yet, in the context of fragile health systems and
limited resources, the need for population-scale epidemiologic data is even more urgent to provide information
on transmission dynamics and inform interventions. The overall goal of the âRole of Data streams In
Informing infection dynamics in Africa (INFORM Africa) Hubâ is to effectively use big data to address
pressing public health needs of SARS CoV-2 and HIV pandemics with the overall goal of developing
population-scale data streams as a cornerstone of future pandemic preparedness. INFORM Africa
proposes to use existing data from Nigeria and South Africa, the two most impacted countries in Africa
accounting for 41% of the continentâs SARS-CoV-2 infection and about 40% of its HIV burden. The Hub is led
by two well-established and successful non-governmental organizations: Institute of Human Virology Nigeria
(IHVN) and the and the Centre for the AIDS Programme Of Research In South Africa (CAPRISA) with strong
links with Universities and their respective government agencies, also engaged. INFORM Africa also partners
with a private partner from the industry â Akros Zambia. INFORM Africa has assembled experienced
researchers with complimentary expertise in big data analytics, quantum information processing, spatial
statistics and analysis, genetics, computational biology, agent-based and data driven modelling, clinical
infectious diseases, infectious disease epidemiology, molecular virology, and geospatial analytics to address
the goal of this submission through four Specific Aims. AIM 1 establishes data streams from public and private
sectors in order to understand the multilayer interactions that may explain the dynamics and impact of COVID-
19 pandemic, through three proposed Research Projects and two proposed Cores, supplemented by the pilot
projects. AIM 2 develops geospatial tools for use by country leadership and governments in pandemic
surveillance and response to improve preparedness. AIM 3 expands data science research opportunities and
capacity through the engagement with the broader DS-I Africa consortium and through several proposed pilot
projects in data science. AIM 4 maintains a sustained engagement with the policy makers and governments in
order to promote further open access to high quality data and the redistribution and uptake of any product/tool
developed by the INFORM Africa. The DMAC & NGS Core is the lynchpin of INFORM Africa, assembling and
managing the Research Hubâs data and providing seamless access to a set of tools and workflows that link the
Hub to the broader DS-I Africa Open Science Data Platform and coordinating center. The Administrative Core
harmonizes and streamlines administrative, financial, and communication processes for INFORM Africa, and
coordinates the selection of pilot projects consistent with INFORM Africaâs aims, and in compliance with DS-I
Africa requirements. Project and Core leads make up the MPD/PI leadership and the Steering Committee of
the INFORM Africa supported by a Scientific Advisory Board."
10290897,"Background: In the last several years, commercial pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing for psychotropic
medications has become widespread as a means of implementing âprecision medicineâ, with some insurers
electing to cover the cost of testing. These developments have put increasing pressure on the Veterans
Health Administration to implement a mental health focused PGxs program, especially for treating depression,
but without sufficient scientific study to support the utility of clinical application.
Objectives: We propose a program of research to evaluate the utility of PGx testing in treating Major
Depressive Disorder.
Methods: Multi-site, randomized clinical trial (n=2000). Patient/provider dyads will be randomly assigned to
receive the results of PGx battery either right after randomization (i.e. intervention group) or after 6 months of
treatment as usual (i.e. delayed results group). The study will test the following hypotheses:
 1. Veterans with MDD whose care is guided by the results of the PGx battery will have a higher rate of
 remission than those in the delayed results group, as measured by a Patient Health Questionnaireâ9
 (PHQ-9) score <5.
 2. Provider/patient dyads that receive the results of the PGx battery (i.e., the intervention group) will use
 fewer medications contraindicated by the testing than dyads in the delayed results group.
The following subject inclusion and exclusion criteria will be used:
 Inclusion Criteria. a) age 18 to 80 years, inclusive; b) PHQ-9 score of >10 and a presumptive diagnosis
of MDD per PHQ9 criteria; c) at least one prior treatment exposure for MDD (psychotherapy or
antidepressant); d) intent to start treatment of the MDD with an antidepressant, and e) willing to provide
signed, informed consent to participate in the study.
 Exclusion Criteria. a) current serious co-occurring psychiatric illness (i.e., schizophrenia, bipolar
disorder, psychotic major depression, borderline or antisocial personality disorder, eating disorder; b) current
DSM-5 diagnosis of moderate or severe alcohol use disorder; c) current DSM-5 diagnosis of drug use disorder
(other than nicotine or cannabis); d) PTSD checklist (PCL-5) score > 39; e) current use of an antipsychotic
medication; f) augmentation therapy, e.g., an existing prescription of one or more antidepressants at the time
of randomization, exclusive of the index antidepressant prescribed for the current study; trazadone at a dosage
of less than 150 mg/day will not be considered augmentation; and f) inpatient hospitalization at the time of
consent.
Anticipated Impact on Veteran's Healthcare: Despite such a compelling epidemiological imperative, the
treatment of depression is often inadequate. As shown now in several studies, to achieve remission from
depression, patients and providers must be persistent and try multiple treatments until they find one that is both
tolerable and effective. However, with each round of treatment, there is greater attrition from treatment.
Replication of the results from the limited PGx implementation studies that have been conducted to date could
usher in a new era in the treatment of MDD and provide an impetus for early diagnosis and treatment, resulting
in more rapid and higher rates of remission."
10813079,"Project Summary
Neuronal-glial relationships play a critical role in the regulation of synapse formation and neuronal
specification. The cellular and molecular mechanisms by which neurons and astrocytes communicate and
coordinate are not well understood. The experiments in this proposal will uncover the molecular and cellular
mechanisms by which neuron derived SHH protein can coordinate the cell behaviors of cortical astrocytes to
facilitate the formation and function of neural circuits in the brain. In our studies we take advantage of the large
complement of mouse genetic tools that allows us to specifically manipulate Shh signaling in astrocytes. Using
cutting edge light and electron microscopy approaches we will define how specific interactions between
astrocytes and neurons are dependent on Shh signaling and assess how astrocytes influence the development
of functional circuits. Collectively these aims will provide a framework for understanding the delivery, reception
and cellular response to SHH in the developing cortex."
10795738,"The central hypothesis of this R01 renewal focuses on a subset of B cells that provide neurotrophic support to counter cognitive impairment and improve motor function after ischemic stroke, a key risk factor for the development of vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). These neurotrophic B cells secrete brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and may be critical to countering the development of VCID. Unfortunately, the patient population most at risk for stroke and VCID aged individuals have impaired B cell development and secretion of growth factors that could limit protection from post-stroke depression and dementia. Sex is also a factor, as elderly women with post-stroke dementia have the lowest levels of circulating BDNF, though no prior studies have directly linked a loss of neurotrophic immune cell populations and the development of VCID. Based on our pilot data, we will test: if a subset of post-stroke B cells (i.e. B cellsBDNF+) upregulate BDNF after encountering glutamate; if B cellsBDNF+ limit the development of VCID and support motor recovery; and if B cell-derived BDNF is impaired in aged females. We will use 4 mos. (âyoungâ) and 16 mos. (âagedâ) female and male mice to test if B cellsBDNF+ support neuronal function, plasticity, motor, and multi-domain cognitive recovery post-stroke. Aim 1 will test if after stroke, (1A) glutamate binds to B cells to increase BDNF production and drive recovery-linked intracellular Ca2+ signaling that is sex- and age-dependent. We will (1B) use B cellsNtrk2tm1Ddg/J in vitro toÂ test if the BDNF receptor TrkB is required for BDNF production and in vitro neuroprotection. Aim 2 will test if B cellsBDNF+ support remote plasticity, as well as cognitive and motor recovery in a primary motor cortex (M1) photothrombosis stroke model. Inducible depletion of (2A) all B cells or (2B) specific B cell-derived BDNF in young and aged female hCD20TamCre/ BDNFfl/fl mice and littermate controls will occur either acute (day 0) or delayed (beginning day 7 post-stroke). Primary outcomes will include 1) preservation of Pavlovian stimulus-reinforcer learning on an automated touchscreen task, 2) improved forelimb precision reaching, and 3) peri-infarct and contralesional M1 plasticity. Aim 3 will test if B cell-derived BDNF augments long-term cognitive and motor recovery. Aged C57BL/6J female mice will receive tMCAo or sham surgery and adoptive transfer of B cells that (3A) overexpress BDNF or (3B) lack BDNF, the latter derived from hCD20TamCre/BDNFfl/fl donor mice, beginning day 7 post-stroke. Primary outcomes will include 1) ameliorated hippocampal-specific cognitive deficits tested via touchscreen pattern separation, 2) improved precision skilled reaching, and 3) regional ipsi- and contralesional diapedesis of B cells, as determined via whole brain serial two-photon tomography, that correlates to within-animal magnitude of brain circuit-specific cognitive function and motor recovery. These studies will confirm an age-dependent loss of a novel subset of B cells, B cellsBDNF+, in females that develop VCID. They will also confirm that therapeutically targeting B cells can counter post-stroke dementia and motor deficits a potential treatment supporting plasticity-based recovery after any CNS injury or disease."
10545026,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
One-third of women in the U.S. have bacterial vaginosis (BV), a condition associated with greater risks of
reproductive tract infections and preterm birth. BV is characterized by loss of lactobacilli and polymicrobial
overgrowth of diverse potential pathogens, including Gardnerella vaginalis. Vaginal sialidase activity is found in
nearly all women with BV and is independently associated with adverse outcomes. However, little is known
regarding how sialidase supports dysbiosis and disease. This proposal examines how the sialidase produced by
certain subtypes of G. vaginalis participates in the molecular pathogenesis of vaginal and intrauterine infection
and encourages overgrowth of diverse BV bacteria.
We have identified the genetic basis of G.v. sialidase activity and found that 80% of BV cases have G.v. encoding
the sialidase genes nanH2 or nanH3, and 80% of women with nanH2-positive or H3-positive vaginal microbiota
have BV. Our data suggests that G.v. sialidase fundamentally transforms the cellular glycan landscape in BV
and shows that glycan degradation encourages pathogen colonization. In three specific aims, this proposal will
use human vaginal samples, diverse G.v. isolates, a mouse model that replicates relevant features of BV, new
wild-type and paired nanH3 mutant G.v. strains, and novel ex vivo models employing native human vaginal
communities to test several hypotheses about the molecular mechanism of G. vaginalis sialidase in the causes
and complications of BV. In Aim 1, we will examine the relationship between G.v. clades and biochemical and
cellular phenotypes in human clinical samples and compare sialidase positive and negative G.v. clades and a
G.v. sialidase mutant in our mouse vaginal colonization model. In Aim 2, we will use our repository of live native
vaginal communities in vitro to test how the availability of free sialic acid and exposed glycans, both
consequences of sialidase activity, influence BV community composition and also examine the relationship
between nanH2/H3-positive G.v. and bacterial burden and diversity in clinical specimens. Finally, Aim 3 we will
evaluate samples from a longitudinal cohort of pregnant women to determine whether women who went on to
experience preterm birth have higher levels of vaginal nanH2/H3-positive G.v., larger numbers of exfoliated
epithelial cells, degraded mucus and epithelial glycans, and more diverse microbiomes with higher vaginal
bacterial burden compared to term controls. The successful completion of these aims will have an important
positive impact on this field by identifying G.v. subtypes that drive pathophysiology, defining mechanisms by
which G.v. sialidase supports the development of dysbiosis and disease, and identifying biomarkers that might
be used in clinical surveillance efforts to prevent preterm birth."
10611837,"Background: The suicide rate among female Veterans increased 63% between 2000 and 2014 â significantly
higher than the 30% increase observed among male Veterans during this period. Despite a large volume of
work examining risk factors, barriers to care, and care utilization among Veterans, little research has examined
these issues as they relate to females. Available research has been limited by small female sample sizes,
cross-sectional analysis, and other methodological limitations. As such, we know surprisingly little about the
health and psychosocial factors, barriers to care, and healthcare utilization patterns associated with suicidal
behaviors among female Veterans. Data on female risk for suicide and their healthcare utilization is needed to
direct valuable suicide prevention resources and help VHA address this growing and serious problem.
Objectives: The goal of our research is to inform gender-tailored suicide prevention approaches, using a large,
national sample of female and male Veterans with recent non-fatal suicidal self-directed violence (SSV: fatal
and non-fatal suicide attempts). We aim to: 1) Develop and test explanatory models of female and male risk for
repeat SSV over 12 months, and 2) Identify similarities and differences in patterns of healthcare utilization,
coping strategies, and symptom change over time between female and male Veterans at risk for SSV.
Methods: This will be the first mixed-methods, longitudinal cohort study of Veterans with a history of SSV, and
is guided by a public health, social-ecological framework to facilitate examination of the range of proximal and
distal risks for SSV. First, we will identify and enroll 30 female and 30 male Veterans for whom a non-fatal SSV
event was recorded in a suicide behavior report in VA's Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW). These 60
Veterans will participate in qualitative interviews to gather data on Veterans' perspectives and experiences with
suicidal thoughts and SSV, their recovery needs and experiences with the recovery process, barriers and
facilitators to care, and how clinicians and the healthcare system could better identify and address the needs of
Veterans like them. We will use a grounded theory approach to analyze transcripts to develop a theoretical
model of risk for SSV among female Veterans, directly informing survey construct selection, quantitative
analysis plans, and interpretation of quantitative findings. For the longitudinal survey, we will use suicide
behavior reports in CDW to identify and enroll at least 480 female and 480 male Veterans, who will complete
health and psychosocial measures at baseline, 6- and 12-month follow up. Self-report questionnaires will be
informed by the qualitative findings and include psychosocial and health-related measures such as coping
efficacy, interpersonal conflict, positive relations with others, trauma, occupational problems, barriers to care,
and mental health symptoms. Participants will be followed for 12 months to assess and document all SSV
events (primary outcome: an SSV event following baseline), which will be ascertained via multiple sources.
Health and utilization data will be obtained from CDW and medical record progress notes. Main quantitative
analyses will use a latent variable modeling framework to simultaneously model males and females in a multi-
group format to test models of female and male Veteran suicide risk. We will then use latent class and latent
transition analysis to identify differential responses to healthcare utilization and how certain health and
psychosocial variables cluster together by gender.
Significance: Findings from this study will provide previously unavailable evidence to support the selection of
intervention targets as well as identify high-priority services and barriers to care to direct programing and
research priorities for female Veterans at risk for SSV. This work has the potential to also benefit the broader
population of female Veterans with mental health conditions or other risk factors for SSV."
10895498,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT - OVERALL
There is a rapidly expanding knowledge base enabling precision therapeutics for a number of human diseases,
but there are significant unmet needs in evidence generation to support translation to the treatment of children
and pregnant/post-partum women. The recent widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) and
the linkage of these data to other large datasets represents an unprecedented opportunity for clinical research
and discovery. The goals of this Center of Excellence in Maternal and Pediatric Precision Therapeutics are: to
address key knowledge gaps and perform clinical research in pharmacogenomics and neonatal opioid
withdrawal syndrome; to leverage data science methodologies and develop novel tools that support maternal
and pediatric precision therapeutics research; and to enhance training for maternal and pediatric precision
therapeutics at the local, regional, and national levels. We bring to this effort a unique collection of
investigators, institutional support, tools, and resources that enable a paradigm-shift from current norms of
slow, incremental progress. Project 1 will: use a community engaged approach to illuminate knowledge of,
attitudes about, and priorities for pharmacogenomics; validate pharmacogenomic associations for maternal
and pediatric populations using the innovative and generalizable strategy of EHR phenotyping; and identify and
quantify variants with unknown functional consequence in diverse individuals to inform future research efforts
and reduce disparities. Project 2 will: develop and validate EHR-based algorithms to identify a cohort of opioid-
exposed infants and their mothers (dyads) and create a novel linkage of these data to state-wide data; test the
hypothesis that use of medications for opioid use disorder is associated with improved early outcomes; and
test the hypothesis that opioid use disorder treatment is associated with improvements in the novel
longitudinal outcome of dyadic stability. These projects are led by multidisciplinary teams that include
Investigators in Pediatrics and Obstetrics, and who are nationally recognized leaders in their respective fields.
Both Projects will be supported by a Scientific Core â the Phenotyping Support Core - which enhances each
project with expert phenotyping, machine learning/artificial intelligence, and experience in generalizing and
disseminating phenotyping approaches. An Administrative Core will provide logistical support for the Center,
supervise training opportunities, and ensure scientific interchange within the CET and with the MPRINT Hub.
This work will contribute to innovative approaches to precision therapeutics for mothers and children and will
develop the educational infrastructure to support the training of physician-scientists to support further advances
well into the future."
10532755,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 A consortium of seven California State University campuses and Charles R. Drew University of Medicine
and Science proposes to continue a training program at prestigious Universities, Centers, and Research
Institutes in Thailand, Argentina, and the United States. The different locations provide outstanding
opportunities for training in diverse aspects of health disparities. The objectives of this program are: 1. To
increase the numbers of individuals belonging to groups underrepresented in biomedical, behavioral, clinical
and social sciences research that pursue advanced degrees and careers in these fields. Our training program
is committed to developing a cadre of researchers that possess a deep understanding of health disparities
issues, passion for resolving them, and potential to be the future leaders that will spearhead new solutions; 2.
To make these trainees aware of health problems that disproportionally affect the most disadvantaged and
underserved sectors of the society, and to prepare them to seek novel approaches to address them; 3. To
show these trainees the importance of national and international research collaboration in addressing health
issues and health disparities; 4. To make them aware of the existing opportunities for research collaboration to
address health issues, and reduce health disparities; and 5. To contribute to the reduction, and eventual
elimination of health disparities among racial and ethnic minority groups in the U.S. To achieve these goals we
will offer a wide variety of training opportunities in U.S. and international locations, using as common model
HIV/AIDS, a paradigm of health disparities. It is well established that in spite of concerted efforts and advances
in HIV prevention and care, people belonging to minority groups remain at significantly higher risk of acquiring
HIV, are more likely to be unaware if they are infected, have less knowledge about prevention, and are less
likely to seek care or comply with treatment. A group of 8 to 10 students/year will participate in 10-12 weeks
research experiences in which they will: a. Receive training in experimental research, design, data collection,
analysis and interpretation of data, use of current literature and the different venues to publish results; b. Be
provided with opportunities to communicate their research results in the form of publications or submissions to
scientific conferences (oral or poster presentations), c. Have opportunities to interact with members of the
scientific community in the place of training as well as in scientific meetings and other related forums like
workshops; d. Become familiar with the cultural characteristics affecting the scientists and population in the
different training locations; e. Be mentored to ensure that they complete the degree they are pursuing at the
time the training takes place and pursue advanced degrees or other health-related careers. The training
locations have been carefully selected to ensure the highest quality educational experience in subjects relevant
to the goals of NIMHD as well as MHRT and to expose the trainees to environments with various kinds of
health disparities, and different ethnic and racial mixes."
10559483,"Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) impacts 11-20% of Veterans, and 70-88% of Veterans with
PTSD have comorbid insomnia disorder. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the recommended
first-line treatment for insomnia disorder; however, using this approach with Veterans who have PTSD presents
challenges and treatment gains are attenuated. There is emerging evidence that the theoretical underpinning
and specific exercises of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) present a viable approach to improving
sleep when combined with evidence-based behavioral strategies. We have developed an ACT-based insomnia
treatment, called ""Acceptance and the Behavioral Changes to Treat Insomnia (ABC-I),"" which combines core
behavioral components (sleep restriction, stimulus control, sleep hygiene, relaxation) with ACT-based
techniques. Our preliminary work suggests ABC-I is highly effective for Veterans with PTSD.
Significance/Impact: Poor sleep is experienced by up to 90% of individuals with PTSD, and typically does not
resolve with PTSD treatment. Insomnia disorder is associated with a host of negative outcomes, including
increased suicidal ideation, poor health and low quality of life. The current study will address this important
clinical issue by evaluating the possible benefits of a novel treatment for insomnia disorder that is comorbid with
PTSD. The proposal is responsive to the HSR&D Cross-Cutting Priority Area of Mental Health/PTSD.
Innovation: The proposed project is innovative in several ways. It addresses a challenging issue among
Veterans - sleep disturbance in the context of PTSD. ABC-I treatment is also innovative, combining known
effective behavioral strategies with ACT, an evidence-based approach for depression and anxiety. The trial
design allows for simultaneous superiority and non-inferiority testing and will lead to rapid adoption of this new
treatment if it is effective for PTSD symptoms and non-inferior to CBT-I for sleep symptoms.
Specific Aims: The proposed study has 4 specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the benefits of ABC-I in reducing PTSD symptoms (PCL-5 score without sleep
item) among Veterans with comorbid PTSD and insomnia disorder as compared to CBT-I. Hypothesis 1: ABC-
I will result in greater reduction of PTSD symptoms compared to CBT-I at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up.
 Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the effectiveness of ABC-I in improving insomnia symptoms (ISI score) and sleep
quality (diary-based sleep efficiency, PSQI score), among Veterans with comorbid PTSD and insomnia disorder
as compared to CBT-I. Hypothesis 2, ABC-I will be non-inferior to CBT-I in improving insomnia symptoms and
sleep quality, at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up.
 Exploratory Aim 3: Determine changes in ACT-related process and outcome measures from before to after
ABC-I, including psychological flexibility, [experiential avoidance], mindfulness, value-consistent behavior,
depression, anxiety and quality of life.
 Exploratory Aim 4: Explore the potential benefits of ABC-I and CBT-I in reducing suicidal ideation among
Veterans with comorbid PTSD and insomnia disorder.
Methodology: The proposed study will address the following PICOT question: Among Veterans with comorbid
PTSD and Insomnia Disorder (population; n=200 randomized), how does ABC-I (intervention) compare to CBT-
I (comparisons) in improving insomnia, PTSD symptoms and ACT-related measures (outcomes), over a 6-month
follow-up period? The proposed analytic plan will simultaneously address superiority of ABC-I over CBT-I for
improving PTSD symptoms and non-inferiority of ABC-I compared to CBT-I for improving insomnia symptoms.
Implementation/Next Steps: The outcomes of the proposed study will be of interest to multiple stakeholders,
including local sleep medicine services and the national programs targeting sleep disorders among Veterans.
Findings will be disseminated across multiple pathways within and beyond VA."
10308530,"OEF/OIF/OND war Veterans have unique post-deployment care needs that the VA is striving to
understand and address. Unfortunately, there is a significant disparity in utilization of mental
health (MH) care and VA access as most war Veterans donât seek needed care. New
interventions are urgently needed to address disparities in post-deployment MH treatment
engagement for our war Veterans and to support VAâs efforts to provide them with optimal
access and care. Online health interventions have been shown to be preferred by OEF/OIF
combat Veterans and have the potential to promote access to VA MH care. Our research team
has developed a web-based interface (WEB-ED) evolved by feedback from Veterans that
screens for common post-deployment MH and readjustment concerns, provides tailored
education about positive screens, and facilitates linkage to VA resources. Data from our prior
studies demonstrate WEB-ED can be successfully implemented within VA and activate
Veterans to seek needed care. Furthermore, emerging evidence indicates that when patients
are educated about their health conditions and treatment alternatives using shared decision-
making (SDM), increased treatment participation and adherence, and better health outcomes
result. Next steps include: linking Veteran WEB-ED screening results to a VA secure network so
that a provider can access the results; and integrating a SDM interface to promote Veteran-
Provider partnerships in patient-centered care. We propose a three phase study to address our
aims. Aim 1 (phase 1) we will gather qualitative information from key VA and Veteran informants
to create an enhanced version (WEB-ED+) of our Current WEB-ED that includes an eHealth
and SDM interface. Aim 2 (phase 2) will use a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test WEB-
ED+ vs. Current WEB-ED in promoting VA MH care engagement. Aim 3 (phase 3) we will
employ a process evaluation to determine the feasibility and acceptability of WEB-ED+ for both
Veterans and VA practitioner and to document the VA processes Veterans use to enroll and
engage in VA MH care. This study will improve our understanding of the most effective methods
to reduce barriers to enrollment in VA/MHV and transferring important medical information using
My HealtheVet (MHV). Furthermore, it will provide important information regarding how WEB-
ED results can enhance the capability of VA providers and transition patient advocates to use
Veteransâ screening results to triage and engage Veterans in patient-centered MH care and
promote VA provider adoption of WEB-ED+ to facilitate patient engagement. Online screening,
tailored education, and links to geographically accessible VA resources has been shown to be
preferred by Veterans, providing recognition of treatable post-deployment MH concerns, and
education that reduces stigma. This study builds upon and augments this prior work with
research to understand and evaluate the processes needed to integrate WEB-ED+ into current
VHA systems to support efficient care delivery, facilitate patient-centered care, and address
unmet need for MH care while also resolving disparities in VA and VA MH care access and
engagement for war Veterans. WEB-ED+âs use of shared decision making is a key component
for promoting these benefits. WEB-ED+ represents a readily implementable and cost-effective
intervention that, with partner collaboration, can be integrated into VA systems through MHV.
Findings have important policy implications for several operational partners heavily invested in
the improved access and delivery of evidence-based mental health care for war Veterans."
10745638,"SUMMARY
The vertebrate innate immunity relies upon a complex set of cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRR) to
detect pathogen-derived, evolutionarily conserved molecules such as DNA. The sensing of cytosolic DNA by
cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) activates the enzymatic synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate-
adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP), a cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) second messenger. cGAMP signals via its
high affinity receptor protein STING, which subsequently recruits TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and interferon
(IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) to stimulate the induction of type I IFNs. Although originally identified as a
cytosolic sensor of foreign DNA, cGAS is also recruited to and activated by fragments of chromatin from
damaged genomic DNA in the cytosol or micronuclei.
Multiple convergent studies have recently highlighted the significance of cGAS in the DNA damageâinduced
inflammatory response and its implications for cellular senescence, tumorigenesis, and metastasis. Nothing,
however, is known about whether cGAS activation in these contexts directly contributes to the maintenance
of genome integrity. Recent studies in our laboratory have discovered that cGAS/cGAMP signaling triggers
DNA damage response (DDR), independently of its well-characterized type I interferon pathway. These
studies revealed that cGAMP-induced DDR activates cell cycle checkpoint responses that lead to G1 arrest
and subsequent suppression of homology directed repair (HDR) of double-strand DNA breaks (DSB) in
CRISPR/Cas9-edited mouse embryos and human and mouse cells. Interestingly, the cGAMP-induced DDR
was also demonstrable in invertebrate species (oysters and starlet sea anemone) lacking interferon-based
immune system, suggesting that the DNA damage surveillance mechanism of cGAMP predates its more well-
known IFN-mediated immune function.
The studies proposed here aim to advance these novel findings by elucidating the molecular mechanism of
cGAS/cGAMP-induced DDR induction via three thematically integrated, yet independent Aims: (1) Decipher
the critical signaling pathways involved in cGAMP-induced ATM activation; (2) Define the molecular
mechanism of cGAS-cGAMP-induced suppression of HDR; and (3) Elucidate whether cGAMP-induced DDR
potentiates the cGAS-initiated innate immunity. In summary, this work will illuminate novel aspects of the
molecular and biochemical basis of cGAMP-induced activation of the apical DDR signaling kinase ATM, and
increase understanding of the relationship between cGAMP-induced DDR signaling and the traditional immune
function of cGAS."
10913286,"Background â Military Sexual Trauma (MST) among women Veterans is a problem of epidemic proportion
associated with significant mental health and functional impairment and substantial access to care barriers.
Surveillance data indicate that one in four women Veterans reports MST when screened. Compared to women
Veterans with other service-related stressors, those experiencing MST have greater mental health problems,
are more likely to report difficulty in functioning in social, family and intimate relationships and are more likely to
be unemployed and to report difficulties in finding a job. Nevertheless, women with MST engage less
frequently in VA health care than other women Veterans. Barriers to care include distance from specialty
services, financial difficulties, childcare and family responsibilities, and gender-related discomfort in male-
dominated VA facilities. Research over the past decade has identified the problems and concerns of women
Veterans with MST but programs addressing their mental health needs and responsive to identified barriers
are lacking. The proposed study addresses this gap by evaluating a gender-sensitive, evidence-based skills
training program delivered via home-based video technology.
Specific Aims â The study will conduct a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation study to accomplish two
aims. The first is to determine the effectiveness of the HBVT-delivered, Skills Training in Affective Regulation
(STAIR) relative to a HBVT-delivered nonspecific active comparator, Present Centered Therapy (PCT) among
women Veterans with MST. It is hypothesized that STAIR will be superior to PCT in regards to improvement in
CAPS PTSD symptoms (primary outcome) as well as in perceived social support and social engagement
(secondary outcomes). The second aim is to conduct a multi-stakeholder, mixed method evaluation to inform
future potential implementation plans by identify barriers and facilitators of implementing STAIR via HBVT and
to contextualize and interpret the quantitative data on treatment processes and clinical effectiveness.
Methodology â This is a four-year, two-site Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation study design. A total
of 200 women Veterans with MST and PTSD symptoms (with DSM-5 PTSD Screen cut-off > 3) will be enrolled
into the study. Participants will be stratified by rurality status in a proportion representative of the national
population (34% rural vs. 66% nonrural). Stratification will ensure that resources are dedicated to recruit the
identified number of rural women. Within each level of stratification, participants will be randomized into one of
two treatments conditions, STAIR or PCT, each of which is comprised of 10 weekly sessions. Assessments will
be conducted at five time-points: baseline (week 0), midtreatment (week 5), immediately posttreatment (week
10), 2-month follow-up (week 18) and 4-month follow-up (week 26). Rurality will be included as a covariate and
assessed for variations in aspects such as retention and outcome, which will help inform future implementation
plans. Multi-stakeholder mixed-method process evaluation concerning STAIR and the use of in-home delivery
of services will include administrator, clinician and patient stakeholders. Expected Results and Anticipated
Impacts on Veterans Healthcare â It is expected that the proposed study has the potential to improve the
quality of VA healthcare by establishing the effectiveness of a social skills intervention, Skills Training in
Affective and Interpersonal Regulation (STAIR) delivered via home-based video technology (HBVT) to women
Veterans with MST, particularly those living in rural areas. The treatment simultaneously addresses social
concerns and PTSD symptoms, both of which are identified needs of women Veterans who have experienced
MST. STAIR has been demonstrated as efficacious in community populations and pilot data with women
Veterans with MST indicate similar outcomes regarding improvements in perceived social support, social
engagement and PTSD symptoms. The use of HBVT has the potential of increasing access to care to this
geographically dispersed and underserved population."
10308533,"Opioids misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose are a serious public health crisis, and a leading cause of
death in the USA. Complementary and integrative health (CIH) approaches to pain may help reduce opioid
related harms. However, a 2016 VA QUERI ESP report stated that âthe evidence base regarding the
effectiveness of select CIH interventions for reducing opioid use is extremely limited.â In addition, the
Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA; PL 114-198) signed by Congress in to law on 7/22/2016
explicitly calls for âexpansion of research and education on and delivery of complementary and integrative
health to veterans.â (Title IX, Subtitle C, Sec. 931).
The impact of CIH on opioid use and pain-related outcomes in VA is poorly understood. Musculoskeletal
disorders (MSD) and PTSD are two of the most prevalent disorders among Veterans in VA care, and their
comorbidity is high: both are increasing, especially among women. Veterans with PTSD are at high risk for
opioid related harms. Veterans with pain and PTSD are more likely to be prescribed opioids and
benzodiazepines, and experience adverse outcomes. Because of the potential mutual reinforcement of PTSD
and pain symptoms, CIH may help reduce opioid initiation and harms for many Veterans with PTSD. VA/DOD
guidelines suggest a role for select CIH for both pain and for PTSD. The CDC Guideline for Opioid Therapy for
Chronic Pain promotes non-pharmacologic treatments, making it likely that the demand for CIH will increase.
However, the extent of CIH use among Veterans in VA care is not well-known, in part because most CIH data
are contained in unstructured electronic health record (EHR) fields that defy ready quantification. We will
examine CIH use and non-use among Veterans with MSD and compare opioid and pain outcomes by PTSD
status. This is an opportunity to anticipate future needs for CIH and to examine patterns of benefit and harms.
We will use algorithms from the Musculoskeletal Disorders cohort study (CRE12-012) to identify Veterans with
MSD, and identify CIH use via structured data (e.g. CPT and ICD codes) and informatics tools on unstructured
data (e.g. clinical notes). We will examine acupuncture, massage, meditation/mindfulness and yoga as they
are currently or likely to be integrated into routine VA care. Using structured data only, we identified 7,621 CIH
users among MSD cohort entrants in FY11-FY13 (n=Â 309,277); of which, 21% had a PTSD diagnosis. Opioid
and other medications will be identified from pharmacy data. Based on clinical observations, the benefit of CIH
is not uniform. Some patients experience dramatic and long term pain relief, while others do not. Some benefit
from one specific CIH modality versus another. To support personalized treatment and optimize future
outcomes, we will also compare responses among pre-defined demographic and clinical sub-groups.
Our specific aims are to assess the impact of CIH on opioid initiation among Veterans with MSD, estimate
whether the effect varies by Veterans demographic and clinical characteristics, with particular attention to
Veterans with a PTSD diagnosis, and to examine potential harms of CIH use, including new diagnoses of
depressive disorders."
10741829,"The sleep-immune axis is highly complex, and the negative impact of inadequate sleep on immune
dysfunction is well recognized. Unfortunately, sleep disorders are highly prevalent among Veterans; as a result,
understanding how sleep influences immune regulation offers novel therapeutic strategies for inflammatory
diseases associated with poor sleep. The transcription factors (TFs) and gene regulatory programs involved in
the sleep-immune axis are not fully understood. Analysis of genome-wide changes in the activity of cis-regulatory
elements, or cistrome, offers an unbiased assessment of TF activity to identify key pathways regulating the sleep-
immune axis. The studies I propose in this CDA-2 application will identify and test TF network pathways
contributing to alterations in neutrophil function during sleep disruption. Because of my clinical practice in critical
care medicine, I am focusing on understanding the mechanistic impact of sleep on sepsis.
 Using an established murine model of sleep fragmentation, I have identified phenotypes of immune
dysfunction related to sleep disruption. Previous studies showed sleep disrupted mice had worse outcomes in
pathogen-based sepsis models. Whether the mortality is a consequence of an early hyperinflammatory response
or a sequala of poor pathogen clearance is uncertain. In this proposal, I specifically tested for the impact of sleep
on the early inflammatory response to sepsis using the pathogen-free, endotoxin-induced peritonitis model. Mice
with sleep disruption had less mortality than matched controls upon LPS-induced peritonitis, suggesting a
dampened acute inflammatory response. Consistent with this notion, peritoneal neutrophils from sleep-disrupted
septic mice have lower expression of Myeloperoxidase (Mpo), a critical enzyme in reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production. Single-cell RNA sequencing from the bone marrow of sleep-disrupted mice showed global
transcriptomic changes in mature neutrophils with activity signature of Stat3, a TF that mediates
immunosuppressive response. These findings support my hypothesis that neutrophil phenotype and function are
sensitive to sleep perturbation. Using the innovative approach of cistrome analysis, I aim to identify the
mechanistic TF pathways by which sleep disruption impacts neutrophil function. The overarching goal is
to identify pathways that could be targeted to modulate neutrophil activation to treat Veterans suffering from the
adverse consequences of sleep disruption.
 This proposal addresses the impact of sleep on neutrophil function through transcriptional regulation.
First, I will investigate whether sleep disruption reduces the fundamental capabilities of neutrophils, including
ROS production, phagocytosis, and NETosis (AIM1). I will then use cistromic tools to test whether the sleep
disruption affects the transcriptional activity of Stat3 (AIM2). Using ChIP-seq, I expect a global change in Stat3
binding in cis-regulatory elements at a genome-wide scale. I will corroborate the Stat3 analysis with an unbiased
activity profiling of regulatory elements using a novel technique, capped-short RNA sequencing. Identifying
where Stat3 binds and profiling the activity of these regulatory elements is a powerful strategy to determine Stat3
activity under sleep disruption. Finally, I will test the impact of sleep recovery on sepsis survival, neutrophil
phenotype, and the kinetic changes in cistromic activity (AIM3). Understanding which TFs are activated during
sleep recovery has the translational potential for restoring neutrophil function when sleep is persistently disrupted.
 The findings of these experiments will have a significant impact on the care of Veterans and advance the
field by 1) identifying fundamental mechanisms of how healthy versus disrupted sleep affects neutrophils 2)
refining the model of sleep-immune homeostasis during acute inflammatory responses; and 3) identifying new
therapeutic targets and management strategies to modulate immune dysfunction due to sleep disruption,
especially in situations where sleep is difficult to preserve or restore."
10911179,"We respond here to a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) for multi-institutional teams to form a
Glioblastoma Therapeutics Network (GTN). Basic scientists and clinical/translational investigators from three
institutions in the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) have joined forces with their counterparts in
the Stanford Cancer Center (SCC) to create the âHarvard/Stanford GTNâ. UT Southwestern is also
represented in one key collaboration. Distinctive features of this bi-coastal GTN include (i) broad and deep
expertise in brain-penetrant, small molecule therapeutics and (ii) a strong presence in the emerging field of
Cancer Neuroscience â a field that addresses the central role of the nervous system in glioblastoma
pathogenesis. Our objective is to improve the treatment of adult glioblastomas (GBMs) and Astrocytoma, IDH-
mutant, grade 4 by taking novel, effective, brain-penetrant small molecule drugs through lead optimization, to
preclinical development and into early phase clinical trials. Our study plan features three projects:
 Project 1 targets metabolic reprogramming in Astrocytoma, IDH mutant, grade 4. Project 2 targets the
constitutive, ligand-independent EGFR signaling observed in more than 50% of adult IDH wild-type GBM.
Project 3 targets a recently appreciated forward-feeding gliomagenic loop between tumor cells and electrically
active neurons in IDH wild-type adult glioblastomas. All three projects feature surgical window clinical trials of
brain-penetrant drugs that are hitherto untested in GBM. In addition, Project 2 will develop novel allosteric
inhibitors that promise to address a shortcoming of all current EGFR antagonists as GBM therapeutics â to wit,
lack of a therapeutic window. Insights from clinical trials will be enhanced by a Pharmacological and
Genomic Imaging Core (PGIC). This core will allow our trialists to monitor drug impact on glioblastoma cell
populations using specialized single cell RNAseq protocols. Drug penetrance within tumors and drug-induced
changes in key metabolites will be visualized using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass
spectrometry imaging and non-invasive magnetic resonance spectroscopy methodologies.
In addition to these clinical/translational research projects and the PGIC, the Harvard/Stanford GTN
offers to host a Network Coordinating Center (NCC) for the broader GTN initiative (as described and
specified by the FOA). Our proposed NCC offers essential skill sets in neuropathology, cancer genetics,
clinical trials, biostatistics, and clinical trial design that will enable multiple GTN centers to work together in
ways that exceed the sum of their component parts. An Administrative Core will serve as the primary contact
and communication resource for the Projects, the PGIC, an Internal Advisory Board, the NCC, the GTN
Steering Committee, and NCI program officials. The Harvard/Stanford GTN Principal Investigator is Tracy
Batchelor, M.D. an experienced clinical trialist with much practical experience in leading large, multi-

10795740,"Genetic and neural mechanisms underlying emerging social behavior in zebrafish
Our goal is to understand emerging collective behaviors of groups, such as schooling and shoaling in fish.
Our approach is to dissect basic sensorimotor transformations in the zebrafish, which we believe play a
fundamental role in explaining emerging social interactions. We have identified two simple and well described
reflexive behaviors: 1) the optomotor reflex (OMR), where fish swim along with whole field motion stimuli and
2) object evoked re-orienting responses (OER) where fish turn away or towards moving objects, depending
on the objectâs size and movement. We have shown in preliminary modeling studies that an implementation
of these two simple âmotor primitivesâ in virtual agents can explain a significant fraction of the emerging social
behaviors in adult fish. A compelling advantage of focusing our studies on these two simple reflexes is that
they are robustly expressed in 7 day old larvae, which facilitates a detailed and quantitative behavioral
analysis of the related visuomotor transformation, as well as a dissection of their underlying neural circuitry.
A critical element in our proposal is the generation of mutant zebrafish that we have shown to display subtle
but distinctive social behavioral phenotypes at the adult stage. We found that, even in the larval stage, and
prior to onset of robust schooling and shoaling behaviors, these mutants already reveal behavioral
phenotypes in the context of the OMR and OER, and that these phenotypical deviations are predictive of the
later emerging differences in schooling and shoaling in adults. One of our central goals is the dissection of
the specific changes in neural circuitry in the mutants that are responsible for these altered behavioral
phenotypes. Some such changes in neural phenotype may manifest at the level of global brain structures, but
many are likely to disrupt micro-circuits - either at the level of cellular identities or synaptic connectivity - that
underlie both simple behavior in the embryo and more complex behaviors in the adult. Notably, we already
have generated realistic circuit models that form specific hypotheses about the neural networks underlying
the OMR and OER in wild-type animals, and these models are readily adjusted to identify and constrain the
specific latent variables that are changed in the mutant animals. Such adjusted models serve as ideal priors
and specific hypotheses to be tested in brain wide functional imaging experiments. Lastly, the identification
of detailed neural phenotypes in mutant animals in terms of anatomical location, neuronal cell fate and
synaptic specificity will facilitate linkage of these anatomical and physiological changes to specific cell fates
and molecular pathways. Our parallel ongoing efforts in describing and modelling brain wide neural circuits in
zebrafish (within the framework of the U19 Team-Research BRAIN Circuits program) will allow us to narrow
down which of all these observable neural phenotypes in the mutants are responsible and causally related to
the specific neural changes that underlie the changes in behavior."
10795739,"Tauopathies may occur by familial mechanisms in which mutations in the MAPT gene are dominantly
inherited causing frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-tau) or by sporadic mechanisms in which MAPT
haplotypes are associated with increased disease risk (e.g. progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal
degeneration). MAPT mutations and risk haplotypes have been proposed to drive disease pathogenesis
through proteoforms that contain 3-microtubue binding domain repeats (3R tau), 4R tau, or both. However, the
mechanisms by which tauopathies occur remains poorly understood. We propose that MAPT mutations drive
tau aggregation and neuronal dysfunction through altered proteostasis. In preliminary studies, we have shown
that induced pluripotent stem cell derived-neurons expressing MAPT mutations exhibit changes in tau turnover
compared to isogenic, control neurons, and we observed differences in the turnover of specific tau proteoforms
in mutant neurons. Neurons expressing MAPT mutations exhibit enlarged lysosomal structures and secondary
elevation of lysosomal enzymes, markers of lysosomes that are unable to properly degrade their contents.
Correction of the mutant allele was sufficient to restore these lysosomal defects. This suggests that altered tau
kinetics may be due to defects in the endolysosomal pathway. Thus, a unifying feature by which MAPT
mutations drive tauopathy is through disrupted proteostasis. The objective of this study is to extend our
preliminary findings to manipulate tau proteoforms using genetic or molecular methods to define the
mechanisms by which tau proteoforms disrupt proteostasis in tauopathies. We hypothesize that tau
proteoforms are sufficient to destabilize proteostasis and to result in the accumulation of tau in vulnerable brain
regions. To test this hypothesis, we will determine the extent to which MAPT mutations cause impaired tau
phenotypes and proteostasis characteristic of tauopathy. We will also generate a systematic genetic interaction
map to elucidate connections between MAPT mutations, proteostasis, and associated therapeutic targets.
Together, this study will reveal novel mechanisms underlying tauopathy that are driven by specific tau
proteoforms and whether therapeutics designed to block specific tau proteoforms impact pathologic events."
10885896,"Background: Safe Patient Handling and Mobility (SPHM) consists of ergonomic techniques and equipment to
move patients who cannot move independently. SPHM helps minimize adverse events (pressure ulcers, falls),
and staff injuries. Despite benefits, we know little about how patients experience assisted mobility. With valid
and reliable scales, we can measure patient experiences, thus facilitating improved care, more tailored
evaluation, and more targeted clinical staff education. Patients in rehabilitation are an ideal group to study.
Specific aims: We will develop a valid and reliable self-report survey based upon patients' experiences of
assisted mobility: the (PEAM). We have three aims. First, the analysis of qualitative interview data will identify
and describe important concepts of patients' experiences. Scales and items will be generated from the
interviews. The items will be reviewed by patients and subject experts, assuring content validity. Second, the
PEAM will be fielded and the data analyzed to provide support for reliability and construct validity. Third, we will
examine the statistical relation between PEAM and associated outcomes to establish criterion validity.
Significance: Patient experiences of care are one of the pillars of health care quality. Yet, no measures
assess patients' perceptions of assisted mobility. The VA national directive for SPHM mandates program
evaluation, yet the Voice of the Veteran is not part of the assessment. The sheer number of rehabilitation unit
Veterans calls for their input. The PEAM will provide a valid and reliable measure to address this gap. PEAM
will allow identification of best practices, areas in need of improvement, and clinical staff educational priorities.
Priority domain: Our study addresses the HSR&D priority of patient-centered care and care management. We
examine how methods of care delivery can influence Veterans' experiences and relevant outcomes.
Innovation: PEAM will be the first reliable and validated patient-report survey of assisted mobility experiences.
Methodology: For Aim 1, we will conduct telephone interviews with 60 Veterans discharged from inpatient
rehabilitation units including: SCI, acute rehabilitation, short-stay nursing homes, and polytrauma. We will
interview 30 staff at two medical centers about their experiences with SPHM. Our conceptual model and
interview questions consist of patient, provider, equipment, environment, and task concepts. We will apply
thematic analysis to data to develop and refine constructs. An expert panel will evaluate item fit to constructs.
We will interview up to 15 Veterans to ensure items are understood as intended. For Aim 2, we will test the
instrument with a sample of Veterans (n=800). Item response theory and confirmatory factor analysis will
identify the best performing items. We will assess construct validity between the PEAM and other validated
measures. For Aim 3, we will assess criterion validity through field-based observational assessments and
surveys of Veterans (n=3500) at more than 20 facilities. We will model the relation between patient and unit
characteristics with PEAM. We will also examine patient and unit-level outcomes to establish criterion validity.
Expected results: Our resultant instrument will provide a unique measure of assisted mobility for this
understudied population and assess an important, yet understudied, aspect of the care recovery process.
Next steps: VA operational partners â including SCI/D and SPHM â will be provided with findings, insights,
and recommendations that can support evaluation from their directives. PEAM use in evaluation programs
nation-wide can be planned. Enriched evaluation using the PEAM by program offices could lead to changes in
policies, staff education, equipment, and improved care. Through individual feedback to facilities in Aim 3,
performance improvement efforts can be tailored around specific findings. We will work with program offices to
develop and implement tablet-based data collection methods. With a validated instrument, we can also include
the PEAM in surveys that VA regularly administers to assess patient experiences of rehabilitation care. Work
can also adapt the instrument for bariatric patient handling and long-term care priority areas."
10919205,"PROJECT SUMMARY â Overall
Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most frequent causes of cancer death in children and young adults and is also
the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults. Moreover, current therapy is incapacitating and is
limited by non-specific toxicity. Despite hundreds of clinical trials, few agents have been approved for clinical
use, and the tumors addressed in this application remain uniformly lethal. This Glioblastoma Trials Network
(GTN) application will address this problem through a collaborative group of translational physician-scientists at
Duke University and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center proposing a novel approach for
treatment of GBM using a telomere-targeting drug, 6-thio-2â²-deoxyguanosine (6-thio-dG).
 Telomerase is an attractive target for anti-GBM therapy as it is over-expressed in the vast majority of
GBM. Additionally, our pre-clinical data shows that treatment of tumor bearing animals with 6-thio-dG leads to
tumor regression through the dual activity of both DNA damage and innate and adaptive immune responses.
Most recently through our collaborative effort we have already commenced studies in GBM with a developmental
plan ideally suited to the GTN. Project 1 will use a variety of model systems to characterize how 6-thio-dG leads
to tumor regression in GBM examining both DNA damage and innate and adaptive immune responses, and will
inform the design of the 0 trial proposed in Project 2. Project 2 will examine mechanisms of tumor escape to 6-
thio-dG treatment in mouse models of GBM, conduct a phase 0 clinical trial of 6-thio-dG treatment in GBM, and,
informed by Project 1 and the Biomarker, Bioinformatics and Biorepository Core, utilize a number of
screening, stratification and pharmacodynamic biomarkers to guide decision-making. The proposed Biomarker,
Bioinformatics and Biorepository Core will support accurate and robust diagnoses and pharmaco-dynamic
(PD) assessments of 6-thio-dG therapy. It will also provide a number of utilities including sample acquisition and
distribution, statistical leadership and expertise in the design, conduct, analysis and reporting of biomarker
studies. The Core will acquire high-quality primary human samples linked with clinical data in Project 2 and
develop and validate innovative analytical and immune profiling strategies to ensure rigorous experimental
design and conduct is consistent across the Projects. The Administrative Core will provide organizational
leadership, fiscal management administrative support, and will monitor research progress, oversee data
operations, ensure compliance and quality, and facilitate communication and collaboration for both Projects. This
GTN proposal benefits from strong leadership, an established collaboration, and the large and diverse population
of patients with glioblastoma who are seen at Duke and UTSW. The proposed work successfully completed
would lead to initial studies of effectiveness in patients with GBM, potentially adding an important new approach
to fight GBM."
10756921,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite the success of modern anti-retroviral therapy (ART) in limiting HIV replication, HIV infection remains a
chronic disease creating a substantial burden for both patients and the healthcare system. Moreover, it has
become evident that long-term ART will not eliminate HIV, forcing patients to stay on life-long therapy with all
its deleterious side effects. Thus, efforts to eradicate HIV infection, or at least induce a state of viral control and
drug-free remission are needed. As the virus integrates into the host genome of long-lived T cell populations, it
can persist in a latent state creating the viral reservoir and while HIV-1-specific cellular immune responses can
partially control virus replication, e.g. as observed in the small subset of HIV elite controllers that have
undetectable viral loads in the absence of ART, they have failed in the majority of HIV infected individuals to
control or eliminate the viral reservoir. Therapeutic vaccines have been considered to augment virus-specific
immune responses to improve host control of virus replication and reduce the size of the viral reservoir.
However, frequent viral escape mutations in the reservoir have challenged this concept and thus a therapeutic
vaccine strategy will need to induce T-cell responses that have not already experienced immune selection
pressure. One strategy to induce broad cellular immune responses is to utilize bioinformatically optimized HIV-
1 âmosaicâ antigens and preclinical data from the non-human primate model confirm that these vaccines
expanded cellular immune breadth and result in a significant reduction of median setpoint plasma simian
immunodeficiency virus (SIV) levels following ART interruption. Thus, we hypothesize that HIV-specific CD4
and CD8 T-cell responses in chronically infected ART-suppressed individuals can be optimized via therapeutic
vaccination with an ad26/MVA vector based vaccine expressing mosaic Gag/Pol and Env epitopes to 1) target
novel and/or subdominant epitopes, with 2) cross-reactive T-cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes which 3) will result
in enhanced antiviral T-cell efficacy against reservoir viruses. We therefore propose 1) to fine map T-cell
responses pre- and post-vaccination, 2) to apply state-of-the-art sequencing technology to determine changes
in TCR-repertoire and function and 3) to determine antiviral CD8 T-cell activity against segments of HIV-1
reservoir viruses. Collectively, in this proposal we aim to systematically determine the ability of a cutting edge
vaccine regimen to induce functionally enhanced and anti-reservoir T-cell responses with the goal to inform the
rational design of therapeutic vaccines optimized for functional HIV cure strategies."

HHT Foundation International, Inc. (d/b/a Cure HHT), a patient advocacy group for hereditary hemorrhagic
telangiectasia (HHT) is pursuing the development and registration of pazopanib to improve epistaxis and anemia.
HHT (1:5000, or about 50K in the US, 1.5M globally) is a rare disorder based on ICM codes (operating under
FDA orphan disease designation), despite its general under-reporting. It is a disorder of vascular development,
in which common small artery: vein interactions are abnormal leading to rupturable mucosal lesions. Patients
with this disorder have frequent and severe nose and GI bleeds, are anemic and commonly require IV iron or
blood transfusions. Often, their quality of life is quite poor, isolating them from social interactions, and
compromising sleep, intimacy etc. The genetic defects of this disorder have been discovered, and they have
been found to lead to exuberant growth factor expression (VEGF). There is no registered therapeutic agent. An
anti-angiogenic cancer drug, pazopanib (Votrient), which reduces angiogenic signaling, including the VEGF-
receptors, was repurposed for this rare disorder. One preclinical mouse HHT model revealed benefit with a
pazopanib-similar product for GI bleeds. Further, a small pilot clinical study revealed encouraging results (some
life-altering), as has off-label use in a group of severe transfusion dependent HHT patients. These latter clinical
cases have resulted in the FDA providing our program Breakthrough designation.
A double-blind, placebo-controlled study (n=40 Rx and n=20 pbo) is proposed within a hierarchy of two severity
level patient phenotypes, âsevereâ and âmoderateâ. The severe group will be provided a sub-oncologic dose (100
mg daily) for 6 months. The moderate group will be allocated to two doses, 50 mg and 100 mg daily. Efficacy
would be demonstrated by revealing a 50% reduction in the duration of epistaxis, and/or a 2 gm/dl rise in serum
hemoglobin.
With the HHT Foundation's >10,000 person database, and vast network of patients from each of our 10
anticipated study sites in North America, recruitment for this work will be feasible. In addition to the clinical metrics
of epistaxis and serum hemoglobin; quality of life, fatigue and epistaxis diaries will be evaluated. If successfully
developed, pazopanib would be the first registered agent for this disease."
10308539,"Background: Justice-involved Veterans â military Veterans detained by or under the
supervision of the criminal justice system â have an excess burden of mental health and
medical morbidity, as well as elevated mortality risk compared to the general and
Veteran populations. Despite high rates of use of mental health and substance use
disorder treatment, justice-involved Veterans are at risk for receiving lower quality
mental health and addiction treatment. Furthermore, the quality of their medical care
has never been examined despite their heightened risk for disparities. By examining
patterns in quality of care, identifying patient, provider, and health system factors related
to high and low quality of care, and hearing from justice-involved Veterans and VA staff
about barriers to and facilitators of high quality care, we can develop new quality
improvement initiatives to improve care for this vulnerable population.
Objectives: Specific aims are to: (1) Determine whether justice-involvement is an
independent risk factor for poor care quality; (2) Identify predictors of care quality
among justice-involved Veterans; and (3) Evaluate Veterans' and other stakeholders'
perceptions of factors that explain variation in quality of care.
Methods: The proposal project is guided by the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable
Populations. Aim 1 uses existing VHA administrative databases and established
process quality measures to examine whether being justice-involved is independently
associated with lower quality of care. We will focus on major causes of morbidity and
mortality in this population, including substance use disorders, mental health disorders,
hypertension, hepatitis C, HIV, and colorectal cancer. Aim 2 uses existing VHA
administrative databases to identify predictors of high or low quality of care among
justice-involved Veterans. Secondary analyses will examine a subset of Veterans who
have more detailed data collected during justice outreach. In Aim 3, we will conduct 80
qualitative interviews total with justice-involved Veterans and VHA justice outreach staff,
clinicians, and managers. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research
will guide qualitative data collection, coding and analysis.
Summary: This study will serve as the foundation for future studies that address
barriers to and implement drivers of high quality care across VHA facilities.
Accomplishing these aims will help us understand and improve the quality of care
received by some of our most vulnerable Veterans, improve their health, and decrease
their risks for hospitalizations and mortality."
10531937,"Project Summary/Abstract
About 50 million Americans (22%) suffer from some form of inflammatory arthritis and estimates are that, with
the aging population worldwide, 67 million adults will have arthritis by 2030 with an economic impact higher
than $128 billion dollars. Although interleukin-23 (IL-23) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of arthritis,
the molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Since the discovery of IL-23 regulation of pathogenic T helper
cells that express interleukin-17 (Th17) the importance of direct actions of IL-23 in arthritis is overshadowed.
To highlight its importance we developed gene-transfer models of IL-23 and IL-17A and using these models we
established that IL-23 is a potent inducer of arthritis, independently of IL-17A. Dissection of IL-23 from the IL-
23/IL-17A axis has allowed us to uncover novel mechanisms of myeloid cell activation previously overlooked.
We identified that IL-23 induces arthritis independently of Th17 cells and through activation of myeloid cells. T
cells and myeloid cells share a requirement for costimulatory signals that are mediated by ITAMs. The ITAM is
a conserved signalling motif contained in the cytoplasmic domain of transmembrane adaptor molecules that are
associated and transmit signals from various immunoreceptors present in haematopoietic progenitors. We have
identified that IL-23 induces the activation and recruitment of MDL-1 receptor that orchestrates synovial and
skin inflammation via the activation of osteoclasts and neutrophils respectively. Discovering the cellular and
molecular mechanisms that dictate recruitment and activation of osteoclasts in inflammatory arthritis is central
to preventing this disabling condition. Detailed understanding of these cellular and molecular interactions will
yield insights into regulation of arthritis that can be exploited for therapeutic interventions."
10766671,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with a suicide attempt rate of up to 50% and
completion rate of up to 20%, making prevention and treatment of suicidal behavior in BD one of the most
critical challenges that Psychiatry faces. Women with BD have much higher rate of suicide attempts (SA) than
men, and completion rates are on the rise. The RDoC Suicide Task Force revealed several endophenotypes
that may distinguish attempters versus non-attempters including reward responsiveness and response
inhibition. Further, evidence from fMRI studies indicates that attempters and non-attempters have different
brain responses to reward and inhibition tasks. Alterations have been observed in the dlPFC and OFC, and
these are also the brain regions highly associated with the suicide-related endophenotypes. Unfortunately, the
molecular mechanisms underlying suicidal behavior are not well elucidated and current medications are often
ineffective in reducing the rates of suicide completion. In order to provide more effective treatments for the
highly prevalent suicidal behavior in BD, it is necessary to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie its
associated features, so that they can be targeted with new treatments in men and women with BD. We have
exciting new preliminary evidence supporting the involvement of cortical metabotropic glutamatergic receptors
(mGluR5s) in suicidal behavior. mGluR5 aid in regulation of other glutamatergic receptors, neurotransmission
and synaptic plasticity, which are all critical to healthy mood regulation and cognitive processes. Modulation of
mGluR5 was shown to play a role in reward processing and impulsivity, and mGluR5 associated genes and
proteins have been implicated in suicide specifically. Our novel in vivo data suggest that higher dlPFC and
OFC mGluR5 availability may be a trait marker of suicidal behavior in BD and may therefore aid with the
identification of patients at higher risk for completed suicide. We built upon this knowledge and developed an
innovative multidisciplinary approach to studying this novel mechanism in suicidal behavior. State of the art
positron emission tomography (PET) methods will be used to measure prefrontal cortical mGluR5 levels in
groups of individuals with BD who have and have not attempted suicide in the past. The relationships between
mGluR5 levels and suicide-related endophenotypes will be assessed. Importantly, we will examine the role of
sex in the association between severity of dysregulation in mGluR5 and suicide related endophenotypes, with
the hypothesis that women will exhibit a greater extent of dysregulation in mGluR5 as compared to men.
Further, we hypothesize that individuals in the BD attempt group will have the greatest dysregulation in
mGluR5, and that this will be associated with greatest deficits in the related endophenotypes. These results
may lead to a breakthrough in determining a mechanism that may be important in the pathophysiology of
suicidal behavior, and one that can be targeted for critically-needed improved detection, treatment and
prevention of suicide in BD and potentially other high-risk disorders."
10925400,"Collaborative Center to Develop Improved Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approaches to Endometriosis
ABSTRACT
The overarching goal of this Center is to develop advanced tools and insights for improved understanding
of the pathophysiology of endometriosis, a disease in which endometrial tissue grows outside the uterus and
can cause severe dysmenorrhea, pain, infertility and other sequelae. We pursue this goal to enhance the
diagnosis, assessment, and treatment of women suffering from this common and devastating disease. A clear
pathophysiologic understanding of endometriosis has been difficult to achieve due, in part, to the reliance on
surgery for diagnosis and lesion assessment. Reliance on surgery delays diagnosis and prevents frequent or
repeated evaluation. In recent years, however, collaborations between scientists in our team have advanced a
unifying pathophysiological principle--that of progesterone resistance. Most other pathophysiological features of
endometriosis, including persistent epithelial estrogen receptor action, persistent estrogen receptor and
progesterone receptor expression, cellular proliferation, inflammation, pain, and infertility, can be ascribed to
progesterone resistance. Recently, important findings by this consortium show that Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), an
epigenetic modulator, can cause progesterone resistance, resulting in exacerbation of downstream effects.
SIRT1 is a histone deacetylase that also directly regulates the function of proteins directing inflammatory and
metabolic signaling. We find consistent overexpression of endometrial SIRT1 across all species that we have
tested, including humans, non-human primates, and mice, highlighting a likely central role for SIRT1 in
endometriosis pathophysiology. Furthermore, preliminary studies indicate that SIRT1 overexpression plays a
direct role in lesion survival as well as infertility and has a potential role as a therapeutic target. We present three
key projects based on our burgeoning pathophysiological data to deepen our knowledge, catalyze the
development of novel, non-invasive diagnostic and assessment methods and promote non-hormonal therapeutic
options for affected women. The impact of these three projects on women will be enhanced by patient and
provider educational initiatives from the Endometriosis Outreach and Education (EOE) Core and deep integration
of synergistic data from human, non-human primate, mouse, and in vitro systems, enhanced by the Comparative
Genomics and Bioinformatics (CGB) Core. Collectively, the projects and cores contribute to three synergistic
aims: 1) Enhance early diagnosis and assessment of endometriosis lesions by developing non-invasive
imaging techniques and promoting public awareness; 2) Determine inflammatory and metabolic changes
that underlie the disease process; and 3) Develop new molecular targets for non-hormonal, non-surgical
treatments for endometriosis; The successful completion of these aims will lead to a long-lasting improvement
in the lives of women suffering from endometriosis."

Patients undergoing surgery to treat their bladder cancer experience persisting complications from their
surgery. A lower resistance to infection and muscle wasting are common complications from the surgery.
The radical cystectomy operation is not only extremely catabolic, but fraught with the highest complication rate
of all the urologic oncology surgeries performed. Improve immune function, enhanced healing and reduced
infections would offer significant benefit to bladder cancer. The overall goal of this project is to reduce post-
operative complications from the surgical treatment of advanced bladder cancer and to better understand
how specialized immunonutrition modulates the immune system to reduce infections and skeletal muscle
wasting. The objective of this project is to assess the effectiveness of SIM intake before and after RC
surgery compared to a calorie- and nitrogen-matched ONS to reduce post-operative complications. The
central hypothesis is that SIM will reduce post-operative complications by restraining the expansion of
MDSCs from RC surgery, preserving muscle, and reducing infections. This hypothesis has been formulated
on the basis of preliminary data produced in the applicantsâ laboratories and practice. The rationale is that
surgery induces the expansion of immature immune cells called myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which
lower the resistance to infection and may contribute to muscle wasting. SIM intake restrains the expansion
of these cells, reduces infection rates, and appears to protect against overall complications and muscle
wasting. Guided by strong preliminary data, the hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) To
determine the impact of consuming SIM compared to ONS on post-operative complications from RC
surgery; 2) To determine the impact of consuming SIM compared to ONS on infections and skeletal muscle
wasting from RC surgery; 3) To evaluate the impact of consuming SIM compared to ONS for restraining
MDSCs, decreasing inflammation, and modulating the immune landscape, nutrient metabolism, or the
microbiome. The project is significant because there is currently no known means to prevent infections and
muscle-wasting after RC surgery. This innovative approach could transform clinical practice to reduce post-
operative complications, thereby diminishing the burden of bladder cancer surgery."

Reducing Youth Violence and Racism/Discrimination: The Efficacy of Comprehensive
Prevention Strategies (CPS) project is being submitted to National Institute of Health: Youth
Violence Prevention Interventions that Incorporate Racism/Discrimination Prevention (R01).
This study will evaluate the effects of a comprehensive intervention addressing (a) individual, (b)
educator, (c) school, and (d) community-levels variables. Specifically, interracial and intraracial
youth aggression and school disengagement will be analyzed through a quasi-randomized
control trial of Coping Power versus Coping Power+, a newly developed version with racism and
discrimination content. Educator outcomes will be evaluated by school-level randomization to
traditional SWPBIS alone or SWPBIS+ implicit bias training and culturally responsive
adaptations. Finally, community risk will be evaluated through parental involvement in either
traditional Coping Power Parent program or the Coping Power Parent Program+, that includes
racism and discrimination content. The purpose of the CPS intervention which includes CP+
and SWPBIS+ is to preventatively address individual, school, and community risk for youth
violence and aggression, particularly related to racially based aggression and violence by
intervening at multiple entry points and leveraging the evidence-based Coping Power and
SWPBIS approaches to include much-needed adaptations.
This project will include a 5-year randomized control trial with four conditions: (a) SWPBIS and
CP (serving as control), (b) SWPBIS+ and CP, (c) SWPBIS and CP+, and (d) SWPBIS+ and
CP+. Project planning and student screening will occur in Year 1, with three cohorts of schools
and students in intervention in Years 2-4, and follow-up data for the Year 4 cohort collected in
Year 5. Twenty middle schools (6th to 8th grade) in large districts in Alabama, representing
diverse student populations across race and poverty levels will be included in the project. To
address Aim 1, 20 schools implementing Tier 1 SWPBIS to criterion (i.e., a score of at least
70% on a validated fidelity measure; Mercer et al., 2017) will be randomly assigned to the Tier 1
conditions: SWPBIS+ training or continued SWPBIS implementation. Within each middle school
(6th and 7h grade), students with high levels of externalizing behavior (top 25% based on
screening, described below) will be recruited and randomly assigned to CP or CP+. At each of
the 20 schools, 17 children will be included for CP intervention for each new cohort in Years 2-4,
yielding 1,020 students total with 510 students in each condition for the CP vs. CP+ contrast."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease with complex unknown pathogenesis. Recent evidence supports a gene-time-environment hypothesis whereby environmental exposures trigger neurodegeneration when superimposed on a genetic risk profile. Supporting this premise, long-term adverse environmental exposures are linked to ALS risk and progression; we have shown that measured and reported pesticide exposures strongly increase ALS risk and that high levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) decrease ALS survival in ALS subjects in Michigan. Therefore, there is a need to delineate the âALS exposome,â defined as the lifetime of environmental exposures that contributes to ALS risk. In this proposal, our objectives are to improve our ALS exposome model by enhancing insight into pollutant mixtures associated with ALS accounting for genetic risk, identifying periods of susceptibility to exposures, correlating toxin measurements in easily assessable biofluids with epidemiologic data, and identifying whether these environmental toxins are absorbed into the central nervous system (CNS) in order to improve insight into the gene-time-environment hypothesis in ALS. Our central hypothesis is that identifying environmental pollutants in biofluids and CNS tissues will advance models of ALS pathogenesis. In Aim 1, we will better characterize the ALS exposome by measuring environmental toxins in biological samples obtained longitudinally from ALS subjects from the University of Michigan ALS Patient Repository and age- and sex-matched controls across the State of Michigan to yield insight into the pollutant mixtures that contribute to disease risk and survival, accounting for genetic susceptibility via polygenic risk scores. In Aim 2, we will evaluate residential and occupational histories for association with ALS risk and survival, while also correlating exposure histories to toxin measures from Aim 1, to gain comprehensive insight into exposure mixtures and time windows critical for ALS
risk. Finally, in Aim 3, we will quantitate environmental toxins and heavy metals in ALS and control CNS tissues, and link peripheral alterations with observed changes in ALS CNS tissue and critical exposure windows to thereby ascertain environmental risk factors that potentially contribute to ALS pathogenesis. Overall, successful completion of these aims will have an important positive translational impact by identifying ALS disease risk factors associated with occupational and environmental exposures, while accounting for genetic susceptibility. This proposal will therefore expand our understanding of the ALS exposome in the context of genetic risk, identify toxins that pose a public health risk, identify occupations linked to exposures, and establish a framework to test for these exposures in other neurodegenerative diseases. This understanding of the ALS exposome will support much-needed public health interventions to target modifiable disease risk factors in this
lethal disorder."
10984954,"Aggregation and cell-to-cell spread of misfolded proteins are hallmarks of a variety of neurodegenerative
diseases, leading to cellular dysfunction, synaptic damage, and neuronal loss. Cell-to-cell propagation of TDP-
43, Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn), and tau aggregates is thought to contribute to disease progression in Alzheimerâs
disease (AD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and other neurodegenerative
diseases. Moreover, mounting evidence suggests that these proteinopathies often co-exist in the same
patients to various degrees. Hence, understanding how these pathological proteins spread throughout the
nervous system will open up new avenues for diagnostics and more effective therapeutics for these disorders.
In patients with dementia, synaptic loss and neuronal damage result in part from excessive generation of
reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) that is triggered by aggregated proteins. In fact, our group
has extensively shown that misfolded protein-induced RNS, such as nitric oxide (NO), contribute to synaptic
damage in models of LBD, AD and FTD via aberrant protein S-nitrosylation (forming SNO-proteins).
Intriguingly, we recently discovered that S-nitrosylation of TDP-43 and p62 promotes cell-to-cell transmission of
TDP-43 and Î±-syn, respectively. We have found that both TDP-43 and p62 are highly S-nitrosylated in human
patient brains with dementia, as well as in hiPSC (human induced pluripotent stem cell) and mouse models of
FTD and LBD compared to controls. Concerning SNO-TDP-43, we found that S-nitrosylation contributes to
aggregation of TDP-43 via oxidation-mediated disulfide-linkage; this process contributes to altered RNA-
binding activity and neurotoxicity in both cell-based and transgenic mouse models of TDP-43 proteinopathy.
Moreover, we found enhanced spreading of aggregated TDP-43 protein triggered by RNS-mediated oxidation,
as seen in FTD. Concerning SNO-p62, we found that S-nitrosylation of the adaptor protein p62 inhibits
autophagic flux, leading to intracellular build-up and consequent secretion of misfolded Î±-syn via both direct
release and secretion of extracellular vesicles. In the current application, we demonstrate redox-dependent
spreading of abnormally aggregated proteins in hiPSC models (2D cultures and 3D brain organoids) and
mouse models of FTD and LBD. We use these models to show (i) seeding with S-nitrosylated/oxidized TDP-43
promotes TDP-43 spreading and TDP-43 proteinopathy, (ii) SNO-p62 formation promotes Î±-syn spreading and
neurotoxicity, and (iii) aberrant SNO-p62 and SNO-TDP-43 pathways interact to enhance TDP-43 and Î±-syn

The proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will provide the candidate, Dr. Alix
Berglund, DVM, PhD, with the necessary knowledge, training, and experience to become an independent
translational biomedical researcher in the fields of immunology and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) biology.
MSCs are a promising cell source for treating inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases. Allogeneic therapy
would provide cost-effective and efficient treatment, but is currently hindered by recipient immune rejection of
donor MSCs expressing mismatched-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. MSCs are strongly
immunomodulatory, however, and manipulation of MHC expression may be sufficient to allow donor MSCs to
evade recipient immune responses. The central hypothesis of this proposal, which is supported by strong
preliminary research, is that treating MSCs with transforming growth factor-Î²2 (TGF-Î²2) downregulates MHC I
and MHC II gene transcription thereby reducing the in vivo immunogenicity of MHC-mismatched MSCs. The
aims of this project are to 1) Identify how TGF-Î²2 downregulates MHC expression in MSCs and 2) Determine
how TGF-Î²2 treatment affects MSC immunogenicity in vivo. Both murine and equine MSCs will be utilized to
elucidate TGF-Î²2 signaling pathways to increase translational potential to humans (Aim 1) and non-inflammatory
and inflammatory murine models will be used to analyze how the immune system responds to TGF-Î²2-treated
MSCs in vivo (Aim 2). Completion of the proposed research is a first step towards improving the efficacy and
safety of allogeneic MSCs for clinical use. To accomplish these aims, Dr. Berglund will build on her background
in mesenchymal stem cell biology, immunology, and large animal models by developing expertise in molecular
immunology techniques, in vivo alloimmune response analysis, and the utilization of murine models. Dr.
Berglund's mentoring team has combined expertise in immunology, mesenchymal stem cells, and genetics to
facilitate her transition to an independent translational biomedical researcher. This work will be completed
primarily at the North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine, which is eminently qualified to
train translational clinician scientists, with additional work at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill."

The Columbia University George M. OâBrien Urology Cooperative Research Center is made up of Columbiaâs
leading Urologists, Microbiologists, Geneticists, Developmental and Cell Biologists dedicated to solving the
central problems of Benign Urology. Our focus builds on the work conducted in prior cycles and proposes to
identify solutions to clinical diseases at the juncture between clinical urology, epithelial biology and microbiology.
Our faculty include the leading clinical and scientific minds at Columbia, including Chairs and Professors of
Urology, Nephrology, Pathology & Cell Biology, Genetics & Development and Medicine. Together our faculty
provide the expertise to identify the root causes of urologic disability in three scientific groups. Dr Gharavi has
identified major risk loci for vesiculoureteral reflux and is now correlating developmental phenotypes with both
changes in the urinary microbiome and lower urinary tract symptoms. Dr Gharaviâs tools include large datasets
such as the Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Research Network (LURN), the UK Biobank and the eMERGE
consortium. This effort establishes the field of personalized genomics in benign urology. Dr Mendelsohn
evaluates signaling pathways downstream of Pparg, a nuclear receptor that turns out to be a major regulator of
cell type specific differentiation in the urothelium, as well as the inflammatory response to injury and infection.
The work identifies an off-the-shelf drug that can be a potential treatment for urothelial repair. Dr Barasch focuses
on epithelial metabolism identifying a central mechanism of defense against UTI called ânutritional immunityâ. He
discovered NGAL a protein that blocks iron capture by bacteria, and now has identified a highly active pathway
of heme metabolism that produce CO gas. His tools include novel methods of RNA isolation from small amounts
of cells, novel probes and chelators of CO, of heme and iron and reporter bacteria and mice. Dr Uhlemann
focuses on the evolutionary basis of drug-resistant microorganisms deciphering their molecular mechanisms of
virulence. The Microbial Genomics Biomedical Core not only directs all microbiological studies in the OâBrien but
also serves as a national resource for microbiome and metagenomic analyses and as a biorepository for drug-
resistant UTI isolates. The excitement of our group is encapsulated in the interactions of each component of
research from gene discovery to therapeutic applications including both human and mouse models. In this new
cycle, we will continue to contribute to urological sciences by generating new genomics datasets (to be shared
on dbGAP and GEO), gene lists, animal models (deposited at JAX), bacterial gene editing plasmids and reagents
that can be shared with the urology community. We will continue to collaborate with urology experts in Wisconsin,
Missouri, Maryland. We will fund new Opportunity Pool recipients, building on the roster of 6 new investigators
already funded; and continue to train the next generation of investigators, building on the success of the nearly
90 students who have trained and who have published, received national awards and who are now Urologists
and medical doctors."

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common cause of urinary symptoms in older men, yet we
understand little about its origins, drivers of growth, and how it causes lower urinary tract symptoms. Since
BPH-caused Lower Urinary Tracts Symptoms (LUTS) appears unique to man, we propose a highly integrated
project to create an atlas encompassing the molecular, cellular, microenvironmental, histological and
macroscopic dimensions of human BPH. Definition of the features responsible for growth and progression of
BPH could ultimately lead to new therapeutic approaches to treat or prevent BPH. Our overall goal is to
expand research in benign urology to improve our understanding and treatment of urological diseases. The
components of the Stanford OâBrien Urology Research Center include:
The Administrative Core is based in the Department of Urology and directed by Dr. James Brooks, an
experienced clinician and translational scientist in prostate disease who will administer the Center to ensure
the scientific and training goals are realized and interface with the NIDDK and Urology Research Consortia. He
will be advised by an Internal and External Advisory Board, to ensure progress is made and to provide
scientific advice to ensure success. He will meet with the Investigator Committee to formulate plans, integrate
findings between projects and allocate Project and Core resources to ensure projects succeed.
The Biospecimen/Bioimaging Core, directed by Dr. Robert West provides critical support to projects of the
Center by providing human BPH tissues with deidentified data, generates histological images and manages
these and the MRI images and provides Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI) and data analysis for Projects 1,
2 & 3. The Core also provides this service to the OâBrien Urology Centers and Urology Disease Centers.
Project 1 seeks to define the role of fibroblast subtypes in the development and progression of BPH.
Project 2 characterizes the immune microenvironment and investigates how it is shaped by the stromal cells
and how it influences the stromal and epithelial compartments of BPH.
Project 3 uses MR Images with associated International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSS) and Bothersome
Indices (BI) to construct 3D models of BPH overlayed with histology. These models serve as an atlas for
integrating stromal and immune microenvironment data and gene expression subtypes and will provide a
means to test how molecular, cellular, microenvironment, histological and radiologic features and their
heterogeneity relate BPH to LUTS.
These projects serve as the nucleus for training of undergraduate, graduate, and post graduate students to
become the next generation of leaders in urological science."
10891759,"Postoperative delirium (POD) occurs in 9-50% patients undergoing surgery and anesthesia, which is associated
with increased risk of developing Alzheimerâs disease (AD), and poor clinical outcomes. Advanced age and
preexisting cognitive deficits are associated with increased risk of developing POD. In patients with advanced
age, however, the development of POD is not ubiquitous. Instead, there is marked variation in POD susceptibility
for individual patients in the same age group. To date, little research effort has been devoted to unraveling the
biological underpinning of the heterogeneity of aging brainâs susceptibility, that is, why some aging brains are
resilient while others are susceptible to POD development? Gut microbiota, a consortium of microbes residing
in the gastrointestinal tract, is critical for the pathogenesis of many neurological conditions. In preliminary studies,
we observed a striking heterogeneity of cognitive function after surgery and anesthesia in mice aged 20 months.
These mice were subsequently categorized into two groups, POD group and POD-resistance (POD-R) group.
Feces from the POD group and POD-R group rendered germ-free mice susceptible and resistant to POD
development, respectively. Metabolomic studies revealed that indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) exhibited the most
striking difference between the two groups. The relative abundance of Clostridium sporogenes (C. spo), a key
bacterium that produces IPA, was 20 times higher in the POD-R group than the POD group. Using a mutant C.
spo strain (fldC) that does not produce IPA to mono-colonize germ-free mice, we found POD was significantly
worse in mice received fldC mutant strain than mice received wildtype C. spo. Thus, gut microbiota C. spo and
its metabolite IPA played a major role in determining the susceptibility to POD. Congruent with this, patients with
POD had significantly lower levels of serum IPA than those without POD. Exogenous supplementation of C. spo
and IPA to aged mice significantly increased their levels. Mechanistically, IPA dose dependently increased PGC-
1ï¡ in hippocampal HT-22 neurons. PGC-1ï¡ is critical for mitochondria biogenesis and interneuron function.
Notably, targeted inhibition of hippocampal interneurons with a chemogenetic tool led to severe POD
development. As such, we hypothesize the gut microbiota C. spo and its metabolite IPA underlie the
heterogeneity of aging brainâs susceptibility to POD. We plan to carry out three Specific Aims to test this
hypothesis: 1) to examine the role of C. spo and IPA in the heterogeneity of POD in aged mice; 2) to investigate
interneuron-associated mechanisms through which C. spo and IPA influence the development of POD; and 3)
to prevent / treat POD, PNCD, and AD with IPA. This proposal aims at examining the biological underpinnings
of heterogeneity of aging brainâs susceptibility to POD, an area of great clinical significance. This grant is
innovative as it combines multi-omics, chemogenetics, and PET-CT to examine a key role for C. spo and IPA in
POD heterogeneity. Successful execution of this grant will provide novel mechanistic insights into heterogeneity
of POD susceptibility in aging brain, and potential therapeutic targets to prevent/treat POD, PNCD, and AD."
10517503,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Major depressive disorder (MDD) is uncommon in childhood, but becomes increasingly prevalent
during adolescence. By the age of 18, about 15% of adolescents will have experienced at least one episode of
MDD, with females twice as likely than males to have suffered an episode. This developmental surge in
depression is especially high among teens who have a parent with a history of MDD, with close to half
developing the disorder by the end of adolescence. Despite these epidemiological findings, and the range of
negative downstream consequences linked to MDD, there are strikingly little data on the neural and behavioral
abnormalities that confer risk for future depression onset in youth. The ability to prospectively predict MDD
prior to its onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of â and targeted
deployment of interventions for â at-risk youth, which is strongly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan.
 To address these gaps, adolescents ages 12-15 at increased risk of MDD onset by virtue of a parental
history of MDD, as well as a control sample with no parental history of depression, will complete baseline
neural (fMRI) and behavioral assessments of replicated endophenotypes of MDD (neuroticism, anhedonia,
cognitive control deficits). Growing evidence and our preliminary data suggest that these endophenotypes are
relatively stable trait-like risk markers, have non-overlapping neural substrates, and precede and prospectively
predict depression onset. The project has three aims. First, we will evaluate the neural correlates of these
three endophenotypes in an adolescent sample (n = 148), half of whom are at elevated risk of MDD (Aim 1).
Second, during a 24-month follow-up phase, participants will be contacted by phone every 6 months and
administered measures to assess changes in symptoms. Analyses will test whether behavioral and neural
endophenotype measures prospectively predict onset of depressive symptoms during the follow-up phase.
Importantly, to evaluate incremental predictive validity, we will test whether each endophenotype measure
predicts future depressive symptoms above and beyond relevant clinical, familial/demographic and
developmental variables previously linked with risk of future depression (Aim 2). Third, we will test whether
multivariate machine learning models incorporating behavioral and neural endophenotype markers, as well as
clinical, familial/demographic, and developmental characteristics, can be used to predict subject-specific risk of
future depression onset with sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically useful (Aim 3). Critically,
recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting risk at the individual
level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in
isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Collectively, results are expected to advance our ability
to predict the onset of depressive symptoms and, ultimately, to inform the development of a freely available,
web-based risk calculator for predicting subject-specific depression risk."

Recently, we and our collaborator Randall Woltjer have discovered that the presence of beta-amyloid
pathology greatly increases the formation and/or spread of Lewy pathology in mouse cortex after seeding with
alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils. In this proposal, our team will understand how the presence of beta-amyloid

The theme of the UM-OAIC is enablement defined as the restoration of function in those with impairments and
the prevention or delay of further progression in those who are already disabled. The overarching mission of
the UM-OAIC is to develop, implement, and evaluate rehabilitative strategies that are designed to improve and
restore mobility and functional independence in older persons with disabling conditions. This will be
accomplished by 1) advancing our understanding of the mechanisms by which exercise and activity-based and
multi-modal rehabilitation interventions directed at specific impairments affect multiple body systems; 2)
developing and testing interventions to restore function and minimize disability following acute disabling events
and to prevent declines related to serious chronic diseases; and 3) training the next generation of investigators
who will further the understanding of the aging process and develop interventions that help promote health and
independence in older adults with disabling medical conditions.
The functional impairments and disabilities that occur in older people emanate from acute events, such as
stroke, heart attack, and hip fracture, or reflect the progression of chronic diseases. This pathway of how
disease leads to disability, i.e., disablement, has been discussed extensively. The UM-OAICâs mission builds

11014936,"Objective: This proposal is for a CDA-2 mentored training program that will transition Samuel Edwards, MD,
MPH into an independent VA health services researcher who has special expertise in the design, function and
evaluation of care models for medically and socially complex Veterans. The overarching objective of the
research plan is explore what features of VA Home Based Primary Care (HBPC) drive its success in reducing
hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions, and use these insights to develop an intervention to
promote best practices in HBPC.
Research Plan: Dr. Edwards will conduct three studies using mixed methods. The research approach will
draw upon the literature on patient complexity, core features of primary care, and the chronic care model. The
Specific Aims of the proposed research are to: 1) Characterize patterns of enrollment and care delivery within
HBPC, and determine clinical and systems correlates of preventable hospitalizations, 2) Assess HBPC
providers perceptions of appropriate patient selection and care delivery patterns, core functions of HBPC, and
barriers and facilitators to HBPC performance, and 3) Develop and test a pilot intervention to promote best
practices in HBPC.
Methods: Aims 1 and 2 will consist of an explanatory sequential mixed methods study exploring HBPC patient
selection, care delivery patterns, core functions of HBPC. Aim 1, is a quantitative study consisting of four
secondary analyses of national VHA data to (1) determine predictors of enrollment in HBPC, (2) define clinical
subgroups of HBPC patients, (3) describe care delivery patterns within HBPC, and (4) determine association of
patient subgroups and care delivery patterns with ambulatory care sensitive hospitalizations. Aim 2 is a two
phase qualitative study. In the first phase, we will perform an in depth study of our local HBPC program using
interviews, focus groups and structured observation. Second, we will perform interviews with program directors
at other HBPC programs to gain a broader understanding of differences between sites. In both phases we will
explore perceptions of the patient selection process, appropriate care delivery patterns, and the importance of
core HBPC functions focusing on 5 proposed domains: 1) strong provider-patient relationships, 2) medication
management 3) addressing social determinants of health, 4) integration of palliative care, and 5) coordination
of care. We also plan to explore provider perspectives on barriers and facilitators on HBPC performance.
Finally, Aim 3 will be the development of a pilot intervention to promote best practices in HBPC learned from
Aims 1 and 2, which will be tested locally in a trial. We will perform a formative evaluation concurrently focused
on acceptability and feasibility, with a preliminary look at efficacy. The expected outcome will be preliminary
data to support a multicenter trial of a refined intervention to be tested at multiple HBPC sites.
Career Plan: Dr. Edwards is a physician-investigator with training in health services research methods and
expertise in primary care redesign, team based care, and HBPC. This proposal will deepen his theoretical
understanding, content expertise, and research skills. Specific areas for training are: 1) Qualitative and
advanced quantitative skills that can be applied to mixed methods approaches in health services research; 2)
Content expertise in patient complexity and home based primary care; and 3) Implementation science and
intervention development. The training plan will consist of coursework, seminars, and readings guided by the
mentorship team. Ultimately, these efforts will assist in Dr. Edwards reaching his goal of becoming a national
leader in conducting research and testing care models directed at medically and socially complex Veterans."

non-cellular component of the neurovascular unit, is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimerâs
disease and can be targeted to treat Alzheimerâs disease and Alzheimerâs disease-related dementias.
This is consistent with the mission of NIA. This proposal aims to investigate the biological functions of
pericytic laminin in: (1) neurovascular function, including blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity, cerebral
blood flow (CBF) and brain influx/efflux function, and (2) neuronal survival/function. In Aim 1, the
function of pericytic laminin in BBB integrity will be investigated. First, whether and to what extent loss
of pericytic laminin affects BBB integrity will be investigated using FITC-Dextrans of various molecular
weights (Aim 1A). Next, the molecular mechanism underlying loss of pericytic laminin-induced BBB
breakdown will be investigated, with a focus on changes in paracellular and transcellular transport in
endothelial cells (Aim 1B). Furthermore, the receptors that mediate pericytic lamininâs effect in
endothelial cells will be identified and examined (Aim 1C). In Aim 2, the function of pericytic laminin in
CBF will be investigated. First, how loss of pericytic laminin affects CBF will be investigated using
quantitative autoradiography and two-photon imaging (Aim 2A). Next, whether the reduced CBF is
caused by pericyte loss/degeneration will be investigated in vitro and in vivo (Aim 2B). Furthermore, the
receptors that mediate pericytic lamininâs effect in pericytes will be identified and examined (Aim 2C). In
Aim 3, the role of pericytic laminin in brain influx/efflux function will be investigated. First, whether and
how loss of pericytic laminin affects brain influx/efflux function will be investigated by influx/efflux
assays using various fluorescently labeled macromolecules (Aim 3A). Next, whether the impaired
influx/efflux function is due to BM damage and how loss of pericytic laminin affects BM
composition/structure will be explored (Aim 3B). In Aim 4, the function of pericytic laminin in neuronal
injury/neurodegeneration will be investigated. In this aim, whether loss of pericytic laminin leads to
neuronal injury/neurodegeneration will be investigated at biochemical, structural, and functional levels.
In addition, the age at which neuronal injury/neurodegeneration occurs will be determined and
compared to that at which neurovascular dysfunction occurs. Successful completion of this study will
elucidate the fundamental roles of pericytic laminin in neurovascular function and neuronal
survival/function, and identify novel molecular targets with therapeutic potential in Alzheimerâs disease
and Alzheimerâs disease-related dementias. In addition, this proposal may also lead to the generation
of an innovative mouse model for neurodegeneration and open doors for new research."

DNA replication problems collectively known as replication stress are a major sources of genomic instability in
cancer cells and also a vulnerability of cancer that can be targeted therapeutically. The recent success of PARP
inhibitors in the treatment of BRCA mutant tumors provided an exciting example of targeting cancer cells by
exploiting replication stress. However, our current understanding of the replication stress in cancer cells is still
very limited. Although we know that many different oncogenic events in cancer cells can cause replication
problems, we still don't fully understand whether these oncogenic events affect DNA replication in similar or
distinct ways. Furthermore, we also know little about how DNA replication is altered by different oncogenic
events, and whether altered replication can give rise to distinct cellular vulnerabilities. Understanding the basic
molecular features of replication stress, the major causes of replication stress in cancer cells, and the different
vulnerabilities resulting from altered replication will greatly enhance our ability to detect and exploit replication
stress in cancer therapy.
I have a longstanding interest in understanding the replication stress response in human cells. In particular, my
lab has extensively studied the functions and regulation of the ATR checkpoint pathway, the master regulator of
replication stress response in human cells. Our work has contributed significantly to the current models of stress
sensing and signaling during DNA replication. From recent studies by us and others, it has become gradually
clear that different oncogenic events in cancer cells can generate distinct problems in DNA replication.
Furthermore, RNA transcripts, the products of transcription, have both positive and negative impacts on DNA
replication and repair. Our studies also revealed that replication stress not only exerts cell autonomous effects
on the genome, but also cell non-autonomous effects in cell populations. Based on these new findings, we
propose to systematically define and characterize different types of replication stress in cancer cells, understand
how RNA affects replication and repair in the genome, and explore the cell non-autonomous effects of replication
stress in tumor microenvironments and cancer therapy. These studies may provide us a much more
comprehensive understanding of the molecular underpinnings of replication stress in cancer cells, their impacts
on the genome of cancer cells and cell populations in tumor microenvironments, and the cancer cell-specific
vulnerabilities that they give rise to. The new concepts and findings from these studies could have transformative
impacts on the research of cancer and cancer therapy."

The mission of the University of Florida Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC) is twofold: 1) to optimize
older personsâ physical performance and mobility through interdisciplinary approaches to promote
independence; and 2) to train early stage investigators in aging and disability research while developing their
leadership qualities. Our goal is to enhance late-life health and independence, with a special focus on mobility.
To accomplish our mission, our strategy is to attract studies and inventive investigators from diverse behavioral,
clinical, basic, and technological science disciplines with a common research focus on âpromotion of mobility
and independence.â Traversing the entire spectrum of biomedical investigation, including molecular biology,
animal studies, clinical research, behavioral sciences, epidemiology, data science, artificial intelligence, and
engineering, our research effort addresses the OAICâs general goal: to increase scientific knowledge that leads
to better ways to maintain or restore independence of older people. Our research objectives are to: 1) assess,
using geroscience and translational research, the biological, co-morbid, psychosocial, environmental,
behavioral, cognitive, and other factors that contribute to cognitive and physical function decline, loss of mobility,
and loss of independence; and 2) develop and reliably test, in clinical and preclinical studies, interventions that
target mobility to prevent, delay, or recover the age-related declines in physical and cognitive function. Our
educational objective is to train future leaders in clinical translational research on aging. To meet these
objectives the proposed OAIC trains Research Education Core (REC) Scholars and supports investigators,
resources, services, external studies, development projects, and pilot/exploratory studies through seven
integrated cores:
 â¢ Leadership and Administrative Core (LAC);
 â¢ Research Education Core (REC);
 â¢ Pilot/Exploratory Studies Core (PESC);
 â¢ Clinical Research Core (RC1);
 â¢ Metabolism and Translational Science Core (RC2);
 â¢ Biostatistics Core (RC3); and
 â¢ Data Science and Applied Technology Core (RC4).
 In this renewal OAIC application we will augment the wealth of expertise and remarkable track record of
success of the current funding cycle. A relevant strength of our OAIC is the concerted action of the
interdisciplinary cores, projects, and investigators who address one common research focus spanning the entire
spectrum of biomedical investigation."
11034577,"The leading cause of hospitalization and death in children with trisomy 21 (TS21), also known as Down
syndrome (DS), is lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Children with DS have nine times higher risk of
hospitalization and mortality due to LRTIs caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Understanding the
mechanisms driving the high susceptibility to severe viral LRTI in DS is needed to develop novel therapeutic
strategies to treat this condition. As chromosome 21(HSA21) encodes four of the six known Interferon (IFN)
receptors, TS21 results in triplication of these receptor genes leading to IFN hyperactivation in DS. With the
central role of IFNs on antiviral defense, it remains puzzling how IFN hyperactivation contributes to severe viral
LRTIs in DS. Through preliminary studies we show that, compared to euploid controls, airway epithelial cells
(AECs) from children with DS exhibit IFN-induced dysregulation of NRF2, a transcription factor essential for the
antioxidant response required to limit RSV replication. The AECs of children with DS also show dysregulated
expression of BACH1 and its inhibitor miR-155, both of which are located on HSA21, and regulate NRF2-
dependent AEC antioxidant responses during viral infection. Thus, our results identify a novel mechanism of
impaired airway antiviral responses in TS21, and provide an unexpected molecular nexus between two widely
recognized cellular pathologies in DS - dysregulated IFN activation (interferonopathy) and oxidative imbalance.
Our central hypothesis is that hyperactivation of IFN in the airway epithelium of children with DS
dysregulates BACH1 signaling, leading to reduced antiviral and NRF2-driven antioxidant responses
and greater severity of viral respiratory infection. Our study will address the historical exclusion of DS
children from research related to airway antiviral immunity, and thus will have a transformative potential to
improve their health and survival. To elucidate the mechanisms of pathogenesis of severe viral respiratory
infections in DS and develop innovative precision medicine approaches for this vulnerable population, we
propose three aims: AIM 1: Define the role of IFN-induced BACH1 dysregulation during viral respiratory
infection in the airway epithelium of children with DS. AIM 2: Investigate how interferonopathy and altered
miR-155 expression dysregulates antioxidative and antiviral responses in the airway epithelium of children with
DS. AIM 3: Establish the association of dysregulated antioxidative and antiviral responses in DS with greater
disease severity during respiratory viral infection. The result of this human-based transformative study will
define a previously unrecognized targetable mechanism causing dysregulated anti-oxidative and antiviral
responses in TS21. This ground-breaking knowledge will greatly move forward our understanding of the
pathobiology of severe viral LRTI in DS and will provide the essential molecular foundation for the development
of new diagnostic tools and highly innovative therapies."

Lewy body dementia (LBD), which includes Parkinson disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy
bodies (DLB), is a major form of Alzheimer disease (AD)-related dementia, accounting for up to 30% of all
dementia cases. Patients with LBD suffer from cognitive impairment, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and a
fraction of LBD patients have Parkinsonian motor symptoms. Clinical differentiation of DLB from PDD is
based on an arbitrarily defined âone-year ruleâ, and whether DLB and PDD are the same or different clinical
syndromes remains unclear. Our current knowledge of the molecular commonalities and differences in the
pathogenesis of these two LBD subtypes is limited. Furthermore, LBD is underdiagnosed, due to the low
sensitivity of the clinical diagnosis criteria and challenges in clinical differentiation of LBD from AD. Despite
the overlap in clinical symptoms between LBD and AD, there are key differences between LBD and AD
patients in the responses to antipsychotic drug treatment. The molecular basis of the phenotypic overlaps
and dissimilarities between LBD and AD is unknown. Currently, there is no reliable biomarker for LBD
diagnosis and no effective means of prevention or disease-modifying treatment, highlighting the need to
better understand the pathogenesis of LBD. This project will use an innovative approach of integrative
proteomics, glycoproteomics, and glycomics coupled with network analyses to address the following key
questions: What are the molecular abnormalities that define LBD? Do the two LBD subtypes (PDD and
DLB) have the same or different molecular abnormalities? How do PDD and DLB overlap with or differ from
AD at the molecular level? The proposed research will determine disease-associated changes in human
LBD brain proteome, glycoproteome, and glycome, identify molecular targets and pathways involved in
LBD pathogenesis, and elucidate LBD pathogenic mechanisms that are similar to or distinct from those of
AD. A variety of biochemical, cell biological, targeted glycoproteomics, and functional analyses as well as
animal model studies will be performed to validate and study the identified LBD-associated targets and
pathways. Findings from the proposed research will advance our knowledge of LBD pathogenesis and help
accelerate the effort to discover curative therapies for LBD as well as AD."
10907599,"Northwestern University (NU) is recognized for its strong interdisciplinary cutaneous, ocular, nanotechnology
and immunology research programs with particular strength in investigations related to wound repair and
inflammation. Leveraging these strengths, the theme of the NU CounterAct Center of Excellence (NUCCX) is
the âBarrier Damage and The Immune Cascadeâ, with its goal to promote outstanding translational research in
the treatment of sulfur mustard (SM) injury. The NUCCX, with its 12 senior research scientists, encompasses 7
University departments within the Feinberg Medical School and the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences.
Information generated through the NUCCX will improve patient care to those suffering from SM injury. To
accomplish this goal, the NUCCX has the following Research Projects and Cores: (i) Topical and Systemic
Interventions for Mustard-induced Skin Injury (Project 1); (ii) Reversing the Ocular Impact of NM and SM Through
Novel Therapies (Project 2); (iii) Translation and Trials: Advancing Medical Countermeasure Development
(Project 3); (iv) Administrative Core (Core A); (v) Lipid-Based Materials Synthesis and Characterization Core
(Core B); (vi) Polymeric Materials Synthesis and Characterization Core (Core C); and (vii) Education and
Enrichment Core (Core D). Project 1 will examine the clinical potential of systemically administered PLGA-IMPs
in conjunction with vitamin D3 to mitigate immune activation following NM and SM skin exposure. A similar
nanoparticle-based strategy will be used to evaluate reduction of skin inflammation with topical HDL NP and/or
synthetic melanin PDA NP. Project 2 will define the clinical potential of topical HDL NP-based eye drops in the
context of acute and delayed phases resulting from NM and SM exposure in the cornea. A similar approach will
be taken to evaluate systemically administered vitamin D3 and PLGA-IMPs in ocular NM/SM injury. Project 3
will use non-invasive testing in humans to define the signature inflammatory biomarkers that will be evaluated in
clinical trials testing of vitamin D3 and PLGA-IMP. The translational studies are highly relevant to mustard as
they are based on multi-omics analysis data of archived skin samples from in vivo SM (non-human primate) and
NM (human) mustard exposure. The Admin Core will be a focal point for all University-wide SM-related activities
and will be responsible for coordinating all activities of the NUCCX. Core B will synthesize a suite of organic
cores to be used as templates to produce a library of nanoparticles formulated to be topically applied to the eye
and skin. Core C will synthesize synthetic melanin, polymer-peptide hybrid materials and PLGA-IMPs to be used
for therapeutic development. Core D will foster education and training, as well as advance personal and
professional development of NUCCX trainees and investigators. This Core will also promote inclusivity and
diversity within the mustard injury field. Projects 1-3 and Cores A-D interdigitate with each other and have strong
translational components. The NUCCX is well positioned to take basic findings into a clinical setting, which will
facilitate our understanding and treating SM injury of the skin and eyes."

Progressive gait-balance difficulties, associated falls, and cognitive impairments are common and disabling
dopamine replacement therapy (DRT)-resistant features of Parkinson disease (PD), affecting nearly all patients.
In the prior cycle, U-M Udall Center research demonstrated prominent, multifaceted, and dynamic impacts of
cholinergic systems degeneration in PD gait and cognitive abnormalities. These insights led us to a novel
approach to PD pathophysiology; a systems neuroscience model of deficient integration of attentional and motor
functions. This concept and our prior work position us to pursue integrated clinical and basic research testing
hypotheses embodied in this model of Attentional-Motor Integration (AMI) network disruption. Our results
suggest that patterns of disrupted cholinergic neurotransmission within multiple AMI nodes are responsible for
characteristic PD gait and balance abnormalities, that striatal cholinergic interneurons are crucial integrators of
attentional and motor information, and that cholinergic denervation of key cortical AMI nodes has global cognitive
effects and predicts more rapid disease progression. Project I will employ the cholinergic PET ligand [18F]FEOBV
in PD subjects to prospectively test the hypothesis that specific regional patterns of cholinergic terminal
degeneration associate with specific PD gait-balance abnormalities. Project II will dissect, in a rodent model,
the role of cholinergic neurotransmission in detecting, transferring, and integrating attentional information as it
traverses cortical and striatal circuits. Opto- and chemo-genetic strategies will be used to test whether
manipulating cortical or striatal cholinergic neurotransmission affects fall propensity in the âDual Lesionâ (DL)
rodent model of PD falls. Project III will assess if early anterior cingulate and insular cholinergic denervation has
global effects on cognition and is a predictor of more rapid cognitive decline. Projects I and III take advantage
of unique prospectively followed PD subject cohorts. The Catalyst Research Project will study cellular
mechanisms of cholinergic signaling and its role in visual attention in a key AMI node, the retrosplenial cortex.
U-M Udall Center projects are supported by Administrative, Clinical Resource, Neuroimaging Resource and
Biostatistics and Data Management Cores. We will collaborate with members of the Pacific and University of
Rochester Udall Centers. The Administrative Core will oversee mentorship of early stage investigators, including
a Udall Research Fellow and the Catalyst Research Project Lead. The Administrative Core will direct outreach
to the PD community. Our innovative approaches will advance the goal of the NINDS Udall Centers of
Excellence program to âdefine the causes of and discover improved treatments for PD.â No other Udall Center
is focused on gait and postural abnormalities in PD, on integration of cognitive and motor functions, on cholinergic
deficits, or on use of a pathological predictor to define PD subgroups. The proposed U-M Udall Center will
continue to play a unique and important role within the Udall Centers program."
10551253,"This application is on prevention of African Trypanosomiasis, one of the most neglected diseases of Africa
caused by parasitic African trypanosomes transmitted by tsetse. The absence of effective tools to curb
infections in the mammal and the presence of animal reservoirs necessitate vector control to combat disease.
We will investigate tsetse-trypanosome interactions that influence transmission dynamics. For transmission to
occur, trypanosomes first establish infections in the midgut (MG) and then move to the fly's mouthparts to
access and colonize the salivary glands (SG). The major barrier that eliminates parasites from the majority of
flies occurs in the MG. We have shown that a parasite mediated manipulative process of vector's physiology
transiently reduces midgut barrier integrity early in the infection to enable the parasites to bypass the peritrophic
matrix (PM) barrier. At the core of this manipulative process is the mammalian parasite surface proteins, Variant
Surface Glycoproteins (VSGs), shed into the gut lumen early in the infection process, which interfere with
tsetse's PM synthesis acting through a microRNA (miR-275). Loss of PM integrity through a manipulative
process again enables MG infecting parasites to re-enter into the lumen to colonize SG. We will use an
interdisciplinary research plan to investigate:
1. The mechanisms that reduce PM efficacy and the different components of the parasite VSG protein that are
 responsible for this interference early in the infection process. We will also investigate the parasite
 components that enable PM reduction later in the infection process as parasites migrate from MG to SGs for
 transmission. We will perform vector and parasite transcriptomic profiling to discover potential mediators of
 the intra-organismal dialogue.
2. The role of the tsetse microRNA (miR275) in PM synthesis by identifying its downstream molecular targets
 through transcriptome and Riboseq profiling and by validating these targets using a dual-luciferase assay in a
 S2 cell line and through co-immunoprecipation assays.
3. Tsetse-parasite interactions in natural infections in the field to validate the parasite-vector dialogue we
 observe in the laboratory, and to determine the influence of PM modification on establishment of co-
 infections with multiple parasite species and strains. Using field flies, we will determine the course of
 parasite transmission processes to assess the epidemiological significance of PM barriers.
Collectively, our studies will provide fundamental knowledge on adaptive and manipulative processes that
influence vector competence and disease transmission in an important vector and will reveal potential targets
for interference by transmission blocking strategies or paratransgenic applications to reduce disease."

Extracellular vesicles carry AÎ² and tau that may spread pathogenic proteins across the brain, promote AÎ²
aggregation and accelerate amyloid plaque formation, and may also serve as biomarkers of Alzheimer's
disease. EVs from blood, cerebral spinal fluid, and cell culture contain AÎ² and tau and are proposed to be
central mediators in the progression of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Conversely, EVs may have
benefits in Alzheimer's disease: neuron-derived EVs promote uptake of AÎ² by microglia and reduce
extracellular levels of AÎ² in cultured cells. Up-regulation of EV secretion - induced by neutral
sphingomyelinase knockdown - efficiently reduced extracellular levels of AÎ² in a co-culture of neuronal
and microglial cells. The role of EVs in Alzheimer's disease is currently a major mystery of the disease
mechanism. We will study how neuronal EV shedding is modulated by factors relevant to Alzheimer's
disease, including age, oxidative stress, and proteostasis and neuron-glia dysfunction. Virtually all cell
types in the brain release EVs including stem cells, neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes.
EVs may be used by cells as a form of intercellular communication and may thereby mediate a broad
range of physiological and pathological processes. Cells package beneficial or toxic EV cargo to promote
health or disease. In the mammalian nervous system, EVs have neuroprotective roles against oxidative
stress, cellular stress, and ischemia; and may also promote myelination in aging. In the brain, EVs may
carry aggregation-prone cargo and contribute to the spread of Alzheimer's diseases. Understanding the
fundamental biology of an EV-based signaling in vivo is essential for elaborating their physiological and
pathological functions in Alzheimer's disease. A basic molecular dissection is critical for developing
novel therapeutic applications.

advantage of the powerful and unparalleled cell biological and molecular approaches that can be applied
in the nematode C. elegans as a springboard to study the fundamental biology of neuronal EVs in vivo.
We developed the first system to study neuronal EV biogenesis, shedding, targeting and signaling in living
animals, and this strategy will overcome limitations of cell-culture based studies. This innovative approach
will be used to tackle major challenges in the EV field . Our goals are to: 1) Determine the impact of
neuronal activity, age and stress on neuronal EV shedding and signaling; 2) Decipher molecular
mechanisms that control neuronal EV shedding; and 3) Determine the functions of neuronal EVs in long-
distance intercellular communication and in neuron-glia communication. Our work should inform the
fundamental biology of neuronal EVs relevant to both healthy brain aging and Alzheimer's disease and
identify therapeutic targets to combat diseases like Alzheimer's associated with abnormal EV signaling."

Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, with virtually all DS individuals
having AD by age 60. Despite exciting advances over the past 20 years in our understanding of DS and how
genetics confer susceptibility for AD, there have been few clinical trials to treat AD in the DS population (DS-AD)
and currently no means to clinically impact disease progression. We hypothesize that the biological makeup of
DS-AD is as heterogeneous as the sporadic AD population and that identifying specific subsets of DS-AD for
particular treatments will yield meaningful therapeutic responses. We propose to test a validated biomarker for
sporadic AD, our established proinflammatory endophenotype analysis. This analysis will allow for an
understanding of differences in immune signaling between DS-AD individuals and how this may impact anti-
inflammatory effects on AD biomarkers. For this study we will leverage biobanked samples from the previously
completed Phase 3 clinical trial, âVitamin E in Aged Persons with Down Syndrome (NCT00056329).â For our
proposed work we will employ high throughput proteomics on native plasma and exosome subpopulations to
validate new techniques and develop a framework for designing better therapeutic trials for DS-AD"

10883937,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Age is the major risk factor for AlzheimerÂ´s disease (AD), and as the worldâs population is becoming older it is
increasingly prevalent. There are many commonalities between aging and AD, both on the molecular and
systems level. There is also ample evidence, in particular from work in animal models, that a broad spectrum of
aging-preventive interventions that confer longevity have the ability to alleviate diverse aspects of AD pathology,
such as AÎ² and tau aggregation. These pathologies lead to severe neurodegeneration and occurrence of clinical
symptoms such as memory loss, mood swings and changes in personality. No disease-modifying treatments
exist, only medications that relieve the symptoms temporarily. To find treatments that prevent disease
progression, testing drugs that have already been approved for other indications â a strategy referred to as drug
repurposing â may be useful. A major benefit of drug repurposing is that it speeds up drug development and
reduces the risks for patients, since these drugs have already passed safety assessment in humans.
Thus, we propose a data-driven approach to search among drugs used for other age-related conditions and
identify some that can be repurposed for the prevention of AD.
Towards this approach, we will investigate the effect of the 20 most commonly used drug classes among 65+
year-olds in Sweden (>200 substances also approved for use in the U.S.) on biological aging and AD in a series
of epidemiological analyses. We will use deeply phenotyped longitudinal cohort data to see how drug treatment
changes biological aging trajectories, as well as apply Mendelian Randomizations to mimic the modulation on
drug targets using large-scale genotyping data and emulated target trials in the Swedish Prescribed Drug
Register linked to a quality register on dementia. Following this, the individual substances within the 2-3 most
promising drug classes will be screened in vitro in human cellular models of AD and in vivo in C. elegans models
of aging and of human AÎ² and tau aggregation and toxicity. Top candidates will be tested in established and
most relevant AD mouse models and in models of accelerated aging.
Taken together, our approach to discover new drugs for AD prevention by screening already approved
substances bears great benefits. The fact that much of the testing happens in silico and that the screening
focuses only on drugs that are already approved for use in patients makes our approach faster and more cost-
effective than conventional de novo compound screens."

To advance the development of next-generation personalized therapies for long-term seizure freedom, we
urgently need technologies that improve seizure diagnostics while reducing risks associated with invasive
neurosurgical procedures. Among the more than 1,000,000 Americans with uncontrolled focal epilepsy, many
have poorly localized seizure foci. These individuals face the highest rates of âfailureâ (i.e., ongoing seizures)
after epilepsy surgery. That failure reflects the biology of their epilepsy as well as the overlap of seizure foci with
essential cortical areas. However, limits of current technologies also play a critical role in the high failure rate as
we are currently limited in our ability to sample wide regions of the neocortex (i.e., stereoEEG) or to record broad
neocortical regions without inducing pain, swelling, and neuroinflammatory tissue damage (i.e., subdural grid
and strip recordings).
To meet this need for safer, more effective invasive electrode studies and simultaneously enable discovery to
advance next-generation therapies, this UG3/UH3 clinical trial project leverages a successful, long-term
collaboration between clinicians, engineers, material scientists, neuroscientists and industrial partners at New
York University School of Medicine, New York University, Duke University, the University of Utah, Blackrock
Microsystems, and Dyconex to translate modern thin-film technology into next generation FDA-approved
implantable neurological devices. We have developed and extensively tested a novel electrode array based on
liquid crystal polymer thin-film (LCP-TF) technology with partner Dyconex, AG. When combined with large-scale
data acquisition systems, LCP-TF electrodes will provide higher quality neural recordings than existing FDA-
approved electrode arrays, with improved safely and at an affordable cost.
We propose to obtain traditional 510(k) approval from the FDA for short-term implantation (<30 days) of LCP-TF
electrodes to (1) improve surgical tolerability for patients with neocortical, focal, drug-resistant epilepsy
undergoing invasive electrode studies and (2) advance diagnostic capabilities to determine the location of
seizure foci. Our preliminary work in a non-human primate animal model led to a prototype device nearly identical
to the final device design planned for clinical testing. This work establishes supporting data for entry into
preclinical testing in the 3-year UG3 phase (Aims 1-3) that will lead to 510(k)-approved devices (Aim 4) for a
single-site, randomized-controlled pilot clinical trial in the 2-year UH3 phase (Aim 5) that will test the hypothesis
that performing epilepsy diagnostic studies with LCP-TF electrodes, compared to CG electrodes, improves both
surgical tolerability and diagnostic effectiveness. These efforts will advance the development of next-generation
precision approaches to treating epilepsy as well as support future development of LCP-TF electrodes for other
neurological disorders. Low-cost, FDA-approved LCP-TF electrodes have the potential to revolutionize the
treatment of a wide range of neurological disorders"

Pregnancy is critical nutritional time point that influences the immediate and long-term health of both the mother and
child. While the health and nutritional status of women (eg. obesity, smoking etc.) prior to pregnancy is arguably the
most important for long-term health outcomes, the nutritional status of women during pregnancy including gestational
weight gain, influences birth outcomes, health, and long-term risk for chronic disease. More than one in eight women in
the U.S. lived in poverty in 2015 and women with low incomes are the most vulnerable to poor nutrition, maternal
obesity, excess weight gain in pregnancy and poor birth outcomes. Lifestyle interventions during pregnancy positioned
to reduce excess gestational weight gain may reduce risk factors for chronic disease in women and obesity in children.
To impact the health of the most vulnerable pregnant women, infants and children in the U.S., there is a critical need for
scalable and effective healthcare services targeting under-served, minority women through community-based programs.
The USDA Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) â a National program â is
highly suited to deliver scalable and effective lifestyle interventions in low income and nutritionally at risk pregnant
women. However, there is a dearth of clinical trials testing efficacious, well-designed, culturally relevant and
appropriately powered interventions aimed to promote healthy weight gain in pregnant women with low incomes. In
response to the National Institutes of Health funding opportunity (PA-18-135); Maternal nutrition and pre-pregnancy
obesity: effects on mothers, infants and children, the overarching goal of this research is to develop and test the
effectiveness of SmartMomsÂ® a patient-centered, pragmatic and scalable weight management program previously
shown to foster healthy gestational weight gain and to increase the proportion of pregnant women who achieve
appropriate gestational weight gain. This research will be conducted in two phases; Acculturation of SmartMoms (Aim
1), and a state-wide, randomized controlled trial in 432 pregnant women enrolled in the Louisiana Womenâs, Infants and
Children (WIC) program (Aim 2). The primary hypothesis is that compared to WIC participants receiving usual care,
participants receiving SmartMoms a smartphone based, high-intensity, health literacy-appropriate and culturally
adapted lifestyle intervention promoting healthy gestational weight gain will have greater adherence to the 2009 IOM
gestational weight gain guidelines and significant improvements in physiological and behavioral factors."

Down syndrome (DS), also referred to as trisomy 21, is the most common human chromosomal anomaly,
affecting 1 in 700 live births. Although DS can affect many organ systems, lung and heart disease are the leading
causes of morbidity and mortality. Several congenital lung anomalies are reported in individuals with DS including
airway branching defects, with a 25% decrease in the number of branches and reduced upper airway muscle
tone with dysphagia and/or bronchomalacia. These complications remain constant into adulthood, as opposed
to becoming exacerbated, and are hence likely due to developmental insufficiency.
While abnormal pulmonary structure and function in pediatric and adult DS subjects has been described, there
is limited data defining the ontogeny of these abnormalities. We postulated that some developmental differences
could initiate prenatally. Preliminary data developed for this application shows that DS fetal lungs, starting as
early as 16 weeks gestation, present with pronounced dilatation of terminal airways/acinar tubules, dilated
lymphatics and muscularized arteries. In addition, we find increased lung expression of type I IFN signaling target
genes such as MX1 and IFI27 in DS compared to non-DS fetal lungs. IFN signaling plays a critical role in cell
differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and ECM production, important events for lung development. Finally, our
preliminary data show that DS lungs exhibit altered expression of ECM affiliated proteins, regulators, and
secreted factors (FN1, COL6, etc.). Therefore, we hypothesize that lung defects in DS can initiate during fetal
development, and that IFN-dependent changes in cell proliferation, differentiation and ECM production contribute
to these defects. To test this hypothesis, we will 1) Test the hypothesis that morphological, cellular and molecular
abnormalities are initiated during the late pseudoglandular/early canalicular stages of fetal development in DS
lungs using histopathological analyses and single cell sequencing, 2) Test the hypothesis that excessive type I
IFN signaling disrupts cell differentiation and airway branching during fetal lung development in DS, and 3) Test
the hypothesis that excessive IFN signaling disrupts ECM production during fetal lung development in DS. For
aims 2 and 3, we will use our published fetal lung explants culture model as well as epithelial organoid cultures
alone or co-cultured with mesenchymal cells to test the effect of gain and loss of function of type I IFN signaling
on cell differentiation and ECM production.
These studies have the promise to improve our understanding of the key molecular and cellular differences, and
the mechanisms controlling branching defects in DS developing lungs. The innovative aspects of this work are
likely to have great overall impact and facilitate the translational potential for therapies for DS individuals, as well
as other lung congenital defects demonstrating hypoplastic lungs."
10906034,"PROJECT SUMMARY (OVERALL)
Understanding the pathophysiology of dementia is often confounded by the uncertain causal roles of observed
pathological phenotypes, even when highly correlated with disease. Genetic findings overcome these limitations
by providing a causal anchor from which to begin mechanistic studies. In this regard, the genetic association
between chromosome 17q21.31 and increased risk for tauopathies, including Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD)
and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), is well-established and striking. Despite this well-replicated
association, little is known regarding mechanisms driving the differences in risk between the two major
haplotypes, H1 and H2. This is in large part because this complex locus encompasses a genomic inversion of
970 KB, leading to an approximately 1.5Mb region where strong LD has confounded the identification of causal
variants and understanding of the gene regulatory mechanisms contributing to disease. Here, we capitalize on
recent advances in genomics to comprehensively characterize the genetic mechanisms by which this region,
and the multiple loci within it, impart disease risk, thus identifying new targets for future therapeutic development.
Our central hypothesis is that haplotype and cell type specific differences in gene expression and regulation,
resulting from the H1/H2 genomic inversion lead to differences in risk for sporadic Tauopathies and differences
in the effects of MAPT mutations associated with inherited forms of FTD. To test this hypothesis, we propose a
multi-site, interdisciplinary center composed of two highly synergistic projects (P1, P2) and 4 cores (Proteomics,
Human Tissue Validation, Data, Admin) integrating a highly complementary group of investigators with a strong
history of collaboration and data sharing to connect multiple levels of function: a) genotype to b) chromatin
structure to c) RNA expression and d) splicing, to protein and e) cell biological consequences to
elucidate disease mechanisms. P1 will apply cutting edge multi-OMICs approaches in human induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neural cells and human brain tissue to determine the molecular and cellular
mechanisms associated with the H1 and H2 haplotypes in individuals of European and African descent.
Predicted regulatory element variation between haplotypes will be validated using a pooled CRISPR screen in
assembloids. P2 uses parallel approaches to dissect the genetic mechanisms, cell types and molecular
pathways involved in dominant forms of FTD-tau, and their modulation by the H1 and H2 haplotypes. Project 2
will use similar approaches to test whether H1/H2-associated differences in gene expression and regulation
modulate the impact of FTD-associated MAPT mutations on disease-associated phenotypes and validate the
impact of key haplotype specific enhancer/repressor regions using pooled Crispr i/a screens. Data and results
generated from these projects will be integrated with existing publicly available data and distributed broadly to
the research community. Understanding the mechanisms that lead from abnormal gene expression and protein
modification, to tau aggregation and neurodegeneration will enable us to identify novel targets for drug discovery."

Down syndrome (DS, trisomy 21, T21), a complex multigene disorder and the most common genetic cause of
intellectual disability. However, surprisingly little is known about the underlying mechanisms that lead to cognitive
impairment in DS. There are fewer neurons in adult DS cortex and reduced neurogenesis and synaptogenesis
have been implicated as features of DS development. Yet, what and how specific neurons and synaptic contacts
are affected at which period of development and what molecular pathways underlie these defects that lead to
intellectual disability remain unclear. We propose to build models based on human induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs), to interrogate how T21 disrupts developmental processes in DS. To ensure the validity of the stem cell
based models, we will first establish a cellular, synaptic, and molecular atlas of the DS prenatal cortex. By
integrating molecular signatures of single cells with the cellular changes both in vivo and in in vitro models, we
will tease out the molecular pathways that are disrupted by T21 that account for the altered neural development.
The results from these experiments will provide mechanistic understanding of intellectual disability in DS. More
broadly, the results will address gaps in our understanding of human cortical neuron development and
consequences of mistakes."
10745277,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Thyroid hormone (TH) deficiency impacts vertebrate physiology in a myriad of ways. The pediatric
consequences of congenital hypothyroidism (the most common congenital endocrinopathy worldwide) include
defective growth and hearing, and an inability to achieve maximal potential intelligence. In adults,
hypothyroidism leads to hyperlipidemia, altered thermogenesis, and weight gain promoting obesity. Throughout
the entire vertebrate subphylum, THs are synthesized within the precursor protein thyroglobulin (Tg), encoded
by the single TG gene, under the regulation of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Thyroxine (T4) derives
primarily from a unique, evolutionarily conserved site at the N-terminus of Tg (on position Tyr-5), whereas the
primary formation site for triiodothyronine (T3) derives from the opposite end of the Tg protein. Iodination of Tg
is the sole source of T4 in the body, but only a partial contributor to circulating T3 (the remaining T3 is converted
by deiodinating T4 in various organs). Treatment of hypothyroidism with T4 leaves many patients with persistent
hypothyroid symptoms, whereas direct treatment exclusively with T3 results in dramatic up-down swings in
blood levels of T3. I have been interested to know, what would be the consequences if the thyroid gland itself,
regulated moment-to-moment by TSH, could selectively produce all of the bodyâs T3? Under physiological
regulation by TSH, the carboxyl-terminal ChEL domain of Tg â by providing essentially exclusively T3
to the body â either will or will not be sufficient to sustain all critical developmental and metabolic
functions supported by TH. To test this I propose to use CRISPR/Cas9-mutagenesis to develop the first two
genetically-edited mouse models with homozygous TG knock-in mutants encoding either: a) a Tg-Y5F
substitution (eliminating the primary T4-forming site of Tg) or b) encoding only the secretory ChEL domain that
preserves the primary T3-forming site of Tg â in both cases leaving the primary T3-forming site of Tg intact in a
thyroid gland physiologically regulated by TSH. With these novel animals in hand, I will study development,
growth, behavior, hearing, body composition and weight, and thermoregulation. I will seek rigorous validation
of in vivo hormonogesis studies with parallel cell culture experiments to express the same Tg variants, and
characterize quantitatively their deficiency of T4 production but competence for T3 production, using Tg
iodination in vitro, followed by nano-liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. The plan outlined in
this 5-year K01 Award will permit me to develop additional expertise in whole animal thyroid pathophysiology
as well as cutting edge biochemical skills needed for my future independent scientific career. Furthermore, this
proposal is of significant clinical relevance to understand if there is any special role of T4 from
neonates to adults, while providing deep insight into the evolutionary origins of TH synthesis in
vertebrates, and opening new possibilities for future refinement in the management of human
hypothyroidism."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Immunotherapy, specifically checkpoint inhibitor (CKI) therapy, has resulted in dramatic and
sustained tumor responses in patients with a variety of advanced cancers, such as melanoma,
non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer and others. However, only a subset of patients
with advanced solid tumors derive clinical benefit, and of those a substantial portion progress over
time. The ability to better select patients likely to respond to CKI therapy would optimize delivery;
and reduce the number of patients exposed to agents not likely to work on their disease. There
are multiple ongoing efforts focusing on blood or tissue based biomarkers; and number of immune
cells, especially T cells, in the tumor lesions has correlated with tumor response to CKI treatment.
However, it remains difficult and risky to biopsy solid tumor lesions repeatedly in a given patient.
Since imaging can be safely performed at multiple time points, and multiple disease sites can be
assessed simultaneously, it presents an attractive strategy for patient selection. [18F]F-AraG, a
18F-labeled analog of arabinofuranosylguanine (AraG), has been shown to be selectively taken
up by T cells in laboratory models and in initial human studies. We hypothesize that [18F]F-AraG
signal will increase in patients who develop T-cell immune responses in tumor following CKI
therapy, and this will correlate with subsequent clinical benefit. In aim 1, we will correlate changes
in [18F]F-AraG signal to number of T cells in tumor biopsies obtained pre and post-treatment with
CKI. In our second aim, we will correlate the change in [18F]F-AraG signal following treatment to
observed clinical benefit, defined as either tumor stabilization or shrinkage. In the third aim,
correlate change in [18F]-AraG signal in lung and GI tract with the subsequent occurrence of higher
grade immune related adverse events. Data generated from the proposed study will inform
development of a novel imaging biomarker of response to immunotherapies, optimizing patient
selection and outcome. In addition, our ability to predict which patients will go on to develop more
severe toxicities will inform institution of therapies earlier to mitigate these side effects, as well as
personalize management of adverse events."
10672200,"Project Summary/Abstract
Adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy is a standard treatment for breast cancer patients after surgical resection
of cancer. However, cancer cells commonly develop therapeutic resistance. A crucial factor that decides whether
a tumor relapses or responds to these cancer therapies is the dual role of interferon (IFN) in promoting or
counteracting cancer progression, respectively. A set of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), the so-called âIFN-related
DNA damage resistance signatureâ (IRDS), was recently implicated in resistance to irradiation and
chemotherapy in different types of cancers, including breast cancer. While irradiation and some of chemotherapy
drugs cause DNA damage in cancer cells, IFN1 induces expression of IRDS that mediates DNA damage
resistance to treatments. Therefore, in theory, inhibiting the IFN1 pathway could restore therapeutic sensitivity.
However, indiscriminate suppression of IFN1 signaling could also constrain its anti-tumor effects, which will not
provide the desired clinical efficacy to patients. Inhibiting the IRDS-mediated pro-tumor activities but reserving
the IFN1-induced anti-tumor effects could be a favorable strategy to provide major benefit to patients. To this
end, understanding how the IRDS is regulated and how it protects cancer cells against therapies is urgent and
important. AT-rich interaction domain 4B (ARID4B) belongs to the ARID family and is a chromatin remodeling
protein. Our preliminary data demonstrate that ARID4B is highly expressed in human breast cancer and its high
expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients. Knockout of ARID4B in breast
cancer cell lines and mouse models compromised tumorigenesis. In addition, ablation of ARID4B reduced DNA
damage repair and increased sensitivity to irradiation and DNA-damaging drugs in breast cancer cells.
Mechanistically, ARID4B is required for IFN1-mediated activation of the STAT1-IRDS axis and regulates
PARylation/dePARylation in breast cancer cells. A central hypothesis for this proposal is: The IFN1 pro-tumor
effects are determined by ARID4B, because ARID4B is crucial for activation of the IFN1-STAT1-IRDS signaling
pathway that regulates PARylation/dePARylation-dependent DNA damage response to promote breast cancer
progression and therapeutic resistance to irradiation and DNA-damaging drugs. The hypothesis will be tested
by three specific aims: Aim 1. Determine the role of ARID4B on regulation of PARylation/dePARylation-
dependent DNA damage response to promote the IFN1-IRDS pro-tumor effects. Aim 2. Identify the mechanism
by which ARID4B regulates the IFN-STAT1-IRDS pathway. Aim 3. Preclinical analyses of ARID4B impact on
breast cancer resistance to irradiation and DNA-damaging drugs. This study is innovative because it uncovers
ARID4B as the specific determinant of IFN pro-tumor effects. This study is significant because analyses of
ARID4B function and its regulatory pathway could lead to new therapeutic approaches that improve treatment
efficacy and survival for breast cancer patients."

The goal of the proposed research is to probe object-recognition circuitry in inferotemporal cortex by specific
manipulations of early visual experience. In adult humans and monkeys discrete regions of the temporal lobe

10883957,"A common molecular phenotype exists for most neurodegenerative diseases, including protein and/or protein-
RNA aggregation, lipid level perturbations, mitochondrial dysfunction, lysosomal dysfunction, and neuro-
inflammation. The literature provides evidence that this pathogenic signature of Alzheimerâs disease and
related dementias can be normalized by genetic and pharmacologic activation of lysosomal fluxâone
mechanism to do this is called macroautophagy. To generate mechanistically diverse lysosomal flux activators,
we screened 940,000 small molecules by a cell-based phenotypic screen to identify 108 validated small
molecule hits that hastened lipid droplet clearance. Most known lysosomal flux activators function through
inhibition of mTOR, which suppresses the immune system, putting the already vulnerable elderly population at
higher risk for infectious disease. In this proposal we seek mTOR-independent lysosomal flux activators. In
Aim 1 we employ traditional and novel assays to identify the targets of our hits, as well as their mechanisms of
action. Whether these compounds induce macroautophagy (a cell component recycling pathway) or a
specialized form of autophagy will be revealed by the proposed assays comprising Aim 1. We will also explore
whether lysosomal flux activation occurs by other mechanisms, such as transcriptional reprogramming, or by a
novel mechanism. The data generated in Aim 1 will guide prioritization of lysosomal flux activators that are best
suited for ameliorating Alzheimerâs disease and related dementias. Aim 2 activities will scrutinize lysosomal
flux activator dosing efficacy and dosing regimens in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons, astrocytes
and glial cells from hereditary Alzheimerâs disease patients and in brain organoids derived from these cells, as
well as in brain cells and organoids lacking these mutations. Because autophagy recycles proteins, nucleic
acids, oligosaccharides and lipids into their building blocks for reuse, it is a potential risk that enhancing
lysosomal flux could degrade critical cellular components and therefore lead to on-mechanism toxicity.
Organoids are well-suited for testing lysosomal flux activator multidosing regimens that avoid inducing
cytotoxicity or cellular stress, while also normalizing the pathogenic Alzheimerâs disease-associated
phenotypes present. We will use mass spectrometry-based proteomics and metabolomics / lipidomics to
analyze the organoids after treatment by 20-30 prioritized lysosomal flux activators to learn how to dose so as
to avoid cytotoxicity while normalizing the Alzheimerâs disease-relevant pathobiological phenotypes. Besides
carrying out multiple biological replicates and appropriate statistical analyses, another way to ensure
reproducibility and rigor is that we have distributed our lysosomal flux activators to multiple outside
collaborators to carry out independent cellular assays and and efficacy assessments in models of Alzheimerâs
disease. We hope to deliver a validated, mechanistically diverse, de-risked set of lysosomal flux activators as
candidates to treat Alzheimerâs disease."

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women, with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast
cancers accounting for 75% of cases. Endocrine therapies directed at blocking ER action are highly effective;
however, 40% of women with ER+ tumors develop resistance and progress to metastatic disease. ER+ tumors
relapse late, and tumor cells can remain quiescent for years to decades. Progress in the treatment of metastatic
breast cancer is limited by strategies that primarily target rapidly proliferating tumor cells. Contributing factors to
advanced disease progression include breast cancer stem cells (CSC), which are poorly proliferative and exist
as minority populations in therapy resistant tumors. We identified SRC-3 (steroid receptor [SR] co-activator 3)
as a novel cytoplasmic binding partner of PELP1. Similar to SRC-3, PELP1 is an ER co-activator, and
dynamically shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm to act as a nuclear co-activator and cytoplasmic
scaffolding protein for growth factor and steroid receptors. PELP1 is primarily nuclear in normal breast, but
increased cytoplasmic localization of PELP1 is an oncogenic event that promotes disease progression by
unknown mechanisms. We showed PELP1/SRC-3 cytoplasmic complexes drive breast CSC phenotypes and
genes associated with pro-survival in ER+ breast cancer models. SRC-3 inhibition disrupts complex formation
and cytoplasmic PELP1-induced tumorspheres. Top candidates identified from RNA-seq analysis include
PFKFB family members, which are bi-functional kinase/phosphatases that have roles in cancer metabolism and
CSC biology. PFKFB3/-4 co-purified with PELP1/SRC-3 complexes; inhibition of PFKFB3/-4 blocked
PELP1/SRC-3 complex formation and biology. Remarkably, PELP1/SRC-3 CSC biology is phenocopied in
tamoxifen-resistant (TamR) and paclitaxel-resistant (TaxR) models. Herein, we hypothesize that PELP1/SRC-3
complexes amplify signaling inputs to PFKFB family members that mediate altered metabolic pathways required
for resistant ER+ tumor cell populations. We will: 1) identify signaling pathways essential for PELP1/SRC-3
driven therapy resistance using mass cytometry, and 2) determine the therapeutic benefits of targeting
PELP1/SRC-3/PFKFB complexes in vivo to block cancer progression and metastasis. Our long-term objectives
are to identify non-ER therapeutic targets that can be developed as combination strategies to eliminate therapy
resistant tumor cells in ER+ breast cancer. During the K22 award, we expect to define the molecular links
between cancer cell metabolism and oncogenic events in breast cancer progression, metastasis, and examine
the benefits of targeting this pathway to impair late recurrence. This proposal will provide a solid foundation for
the candidateâs goal of moving towards translational cancer research during her transition to independence.
Delineating the key players will fundamentally redefine standard care options to target therapy-resistant
populations in ER+ breast cancer."

limitations. During its prior funding cycle, the Boston OAIC established 3 resource cores and supported 17
external projects, 9 pilot projects, 9 research education career (REC) awards, and 4 developmental projects.
These investments contributed directly to the advancement of several highly talented early career scientists,
including 3 Beeson awardees; enhanced research innovation and productivity, reflected in high quality peer-
reviewed publications; provided research core support to many NIH-funded innovative projects by OAIC
investigators; enabled substantial expansion of OAIC's collaborations with other Boston area aging centers
and with other OAICs; and spurred new technologies, inventions, and patents.
During the past cycle, the OAIC's center of gravity shifted to Harvard-affiliated medical centers due to the
relocation of the PI. With the inclusion of several Harvard geriatricians in its leadership, the Boston OAIC is
now well integrated with the Harvard Geriatrics and Gerontology research community and programs, including
its T32 training grant, Harvard Clinical Translational Science Institute, the Roybal Center, The New England
Geriatrics Research Clinical Education Center, and the Glenn Foundation Center for Biology of Aging.
During the next funding cycle, the Boston OAIC will maintain its thematic focus on FPTs and its positioning
across the entire spectrum of translational science from mechanism elucidation, preclinical proof-of-concept
studies, biomarker validation, epidemiologic investigation to randomized trials of FPTs. The OAICâs research
program is founded on a platform of four cores: Leadership and Administrative Core (LAC), Research
Education Core (REC), Pilot and Exploratory Studies Core (PESC), and Resource Cores (RC). The OAIC will
integrate 19 externally-funded studies, and REC, PESC and developmental projects into a cohesive
interdisciplinary program that is supported by 3 resource cores: Function Assessment Core, Preclinical
Discovery Core, Biostatistics and Data Science Core. The REC will recruit the most promising stars from a vast
reservoir of talent at Harvard, Tufts and BU, and train them through didactic and mentored research programs.

the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai that seeks to establish robust collaborations on-site
and online training and education to increase HU faculty's research capacity in the area of
genetics and genomics and health disparities, while increasing TCI research in health disparities,
using the examples of prostate and breast cancer. The final goal is to create a competitive and
sustainable joint Center for Genetics and Genomics Cancer Research, encompassing the
genetics and genomics aspects of health disparities to explain population differences in breast
and prostate cancer occurrence and outcome.
The proposal is grounded in a longstanding and productive undergraduate educational
collaboration between faculty at these two institutions, but is distinct in its focus, methods, and
goals. Hence, the proposed program will utilize the best practices learned from previous
collaborative endeavors to inform and create an innovative platform which will enhance research
capacity at both institutions while addressing key institutional challenges. Our goals will be
accomplished through a series of well-coordinated training/educational activities and two pilot
research projects that were strategically chosen to meet our overarching goals of 1) improving
health outcomes in vulnerable populations, 2) addressing gaps in cancer disparities research, 3)
augmenting genomic, statistics, epidemiology expertise and 4) enhancing investigator
productivity and extramural funding competitiveness.
Training and education will aim to increase HU faculty's research capacity in the area of genetics
and genomics and health disparities, using the examples of prostate and breast cancer. It will
provide TCI ISMMS with access and collaboration to scientific projects in breast and prostate
cancer disparity etiology, treatment and outcome, as well as to a mechanism to increase the
diversity of the genetics and genomics faculty, which has traditionally lacked diversity
To ensure the success of the training and education program, we have assembled an excellent
team of faculty with outstanding mentoring and teaching track records, along with extensive
expertise in developing and implementing new initiatives aimed at diversifying the clinical
investigator workforce and eliminating health disparities. HU faculty will also be exposed to the
most novel and cutting edge methods in cancer genomics through the completion of the pilot

Alzheimerâs disease (AD) is a multifactorial disorder with complex etiologies and the impact of sex on AD varies
over the course of clinical and neuropathological development. Basic and clinical research studies support sex-
specific contributions to AD pathogenesis and progression. Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele has been identified
as a primary genetic risk factor. The interplay between sex and APOE4 allele in AD risks, clinical manifestation,
pathological processes as well as treatment responsiveness in various clinical trials have been explored.
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying sex dimorphism in AD and how APOE4 stratifies sex divergence
in AD remain elusive. Multi-omics data in tandem with systems biology approaches offer a new avenue to not
only dissect sex- and APOE-stratified molecular mechanisms of AD but also develop sex-specific diagnostic and
therapeutic interventions for AD. Single-cell transcriptomic datasets as well as cell deconvolution of bulk tissue
transcriptomes provide in-depth insights into brain region-specific and cell-type specific impact on sex
dimorphism in AD. In this application, we propose to develop sex- and APOE-specific network models of AD by
performing integrative multiscale network analysis of large-scale bulk and single multi-omics data. In particular,
we will develop the first cohort of single nucleus multi-omics data in AD (simultaneous RNA-sequencing and
ATAC-sequencing of each single cell) that can meaningfully be stratified by sex and APOE genotype. We will
also curate existing single nucleus RNA-seq datasets in AD and combine with our own single cell multi-omics
dataset to identify sex-specific genetic variants and molecular signatures of AD (Aim 1). We will perform
integrative network analysis to investigate the interplay between sex and APOE genotypes in AD at brain-region
and single-cell levels and identify from the network models sex- and APOE-specific, network drivers for AD (Aim
2). We will then identify potential therapeutics of selected key drivers with drug candidate prediction through
virtual clinical trials of large electronic medical record (EMR) databases (Aim 3). Finally, we will functionally
validate the top predicted sex- and APOE-specific molecular network drivers by genetic manipulations (up- or
down-regulation of gene expression), as well as pharmacological perturbation with drug candidates identified
from virtual drug screening using relevant human iPSC culture systems and AD mouse models (Aim 4). The
findings from this project will guide future development of efficacious sex- and APOE-stratified interventions for
AD."

One quarter of the global population is infected with the bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is at risk of
developing active tuberculosis (TB) disease and death, especially persons living with HIV (PLWH). Alcohol use
is increasingly being recognized as a driver of the TB epidemic, and may be a vital means to mitigate HIV/TB
morbidity and mortality. TB preventive therapy (TPT) is an important approach in preventing the progression of
latent TB infection to active TB disease. However, TPT does not prevent new or repeat TB infection, thus
PLWH who drink alcohol may remain at increased risk for TB acquisition, even after receipt of TPT. Heavy
alcohol use is common among persons living with HIV (PLWH). While the increased risk for active TB is
attributed to alcohol-related immunosuppression leading to latent TB re-activation, the role of alcohol use in
acquiring new or repeat TB infection and progression to active TB disease after TPT has not been extensively
examined, including among PLWH. Those who complete TB treatment have extensive post-TB morbidity and
almost a 4-fold higher risk of mortality. The role of both heavy alcohol use and HIV in promoting lung disease
after TB treatment is not clear. The central goal of the International Uganda Russia Boston Alcohol Network
for Alcohol Research Collaboration on HIV/AIDS (URBAN ARCH) Center is to examine the role of alcohol use
on new TB acquisition, occurrence of active TB disease after TPT, and post-TB lung disease among PLWH.
This new knowledge will enable future development of interventions that can reduce alcoholâs impact on TB-
related morbidity and mortality among PLWH. The Center will be comprised of 4 components (Administrative
Core, Biostatistics and Data Management [BDM] Core, Uganda Project, Russia Project) that will work
synergistically to accomplish the following primary objectives: 1) Examine the role of alcohol use in driving
the acquisition of new TB infection and the occurrence of active TB disease after TPT in PLWH in Uganda
(Uganda Project). This new knowledge will inform potential new interventions to reduce risk of TB acquisition
and active disease; 2) Determine the relationship between alcohol use and lung disease after treatment for
active TB disease among PLWH and qualitatively evaluate factors to tailor alcohol and smoking interventions
in the setting of TB treatment in PLWH (Russia Project); 3) Conduct high quality data management and
statistical analyses for HIV/alcohol research (BDM Core); 4) Foster multidisciplinary international collaborations
to promote innovative and rigorous HIV/alcohol research (Administrative Core); and 5) Provide ongoing training
and mentoring to develop junior and mid-career investigators into future leaders in HIV/alcohol research
(Administrative Core). The structure of the International URBAN ARCH Center will ensure effective
administrative and scientific integration of a broad range of activities designed to synergistically grow the field
of HIV/alcohol/TB prevention and treatment."

By 2050, approximately 13.8 million people in the U.S. are projected to have Alzheimer's disease (AD), two-
thirds of whom will be women. Secondary to genetics, cardiometabolic diseases (CMD), such as hypertension
and diabetes, are major independent risk factors for AD. There are significant sex differences in pathology,
timing, and clinical presentation of these diseases in early midlife. Despite this, the shared pathophysiology
underlying CMD and AD, and sex differences therein, are largely unexplored. Here, we will test the
hypothesis that sex differences in immune pathophysiology, in part, underlies the sex-dependent
impact of cardiometabolic dysfunction on AD risk in midlife. We propose to recruit 240 people, ages 50-
75, equally divided by sex, that are âhigh and low riskâ (HR & LR) for AD, defined as those with genetic risk and
CMD vs. those without. Currently, we are recruiting 100 people (ages 50-70), whom we will re-recruit in the
current study at ages 55-75. We will develop a general AD polygenic risk score (PRS) and a sex-stratified PRS
to select HR and LR individuals along with presence or absence of CMD. We are conducting extensive in-clinic
assessments to characterize structural and functional MRI (s/fMRI), cognitive function, hormone and immune
profiling, cardiophysiology, neurovascular structure/function, genotype, RNA transcription and cell metabolism
of monocyte cells, AÎ² PET imaging, and AD blood-based biomarkers. Here, we propose to recruit an additional
140 HR and LR subjects, equally divided by sex, in order to obtain adequate statistical power to test for the
shared sex-dependent impact of immune dysregulation underlying the association between CMD and AD-
related pathology. Further, we will follow the current 100 subjects to evaluate the longitudinal impact of immune
dysregulation on 5-year change in AD-related pathology by sex. We predict that HR vs. LR individuals will
express significantly greater AD-related pathology [blood-based & PET AD biomarkers and memory circuitry
deficits in entorhinal cortex, temporoparietal, cingulate, medial prefrontal cortex, locus coeruleus, and
paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus], metabolic and neurovascular deficits, and dysregulation of immune
pathway genes, cellular metabolism, and increased pro-inflammatory markers, with postmenopausal women
worse than men. Further, we predict immune dysregulation will mediate (i.e., in part, explain) the relationship
between HR vs. LR and AD-related pathology, and that this mediation will be stronger (larger effect sizes) in
postmenopausal women versus men. Finally, in exploratory analyses, we predict that the presence of CMD will
exacerbate the effects of genetic risk alone on AD-related pathology, with women experiencing worse
outcomes than men. Overall, identifying sex-dependent mechanisms will have substantial implications for
developing neuroimmune therapeutics that may differ by sex and targeted early for prevention."

Short-term memory is an essential component of cognition. Here, we will investigate an ethologically
relevant form of short-term memory that guides navigation behavior: memory of odor concentration across
sniffs. This intersniff memory has been shown to guide olfactory search in studies of freely moving animals,
but the stimuli in these experiments are hard to control and measure. To better control concentration
fluctuation, we have developed a system for presenting stimuli that rapidly change concentration to head-
fixed mice. Using this system, we have revealed that neurons of the olfactory bulb have intersniff memory,
with responses that depend on stimulation in previous sniffs. Here, we will investigate the duration,
resolution, and cellular basis of intersniff memory representations using electrophysiology, 2-photon
imaging, and high-resolution behavioral analysis.
Will intersniff memory codes inferred from head-fixed experiments generalize to natural behavior? To
answer this question, we have established an unrestrained olfactory navigation assay. Mice learn this task
rapidly, and solve the task by following odor concentration changes. We have found that mice execute a
repertoire of three-dimensional movements that are precisely synchronized to the sniff cycle. Importantly,
these behavioral dynamics are only revealed when an animal is able to move naturally in the environment.
How do these movements impact intersniff memory representations? Our behavioral task gives us an
unprecedented opportunity to test receptive field models derived from controlled simple stimulation in the
context of naturalistic stimulation and movement. For a given mouse, we will first record in head-fixed and
determine intersniff memory coding in that condition. We will then test the same neurons in the same mouse
in our behavioral task. How well can the head-fixed coding rules predict activity in the freely-moving
condition? By defining the neural representation of ethologically relevant odor dynamics, our work will
advance a general understanding of how the brain implements short-term memory for input that changes
through time, which is essential to guide successful behavior."
10891782,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Alzheimerâs Disease is a debilitating degenerative disease without effective treatment that is increasing in
prevalence. Developing effective therapies has been impeded because the underlying biological mechanisms
driving disease pathogenesis are still poorly understood. Abnormal cleavage of amyloid precursor protein
(APP) that generates aggregating forms of neurotoxic amyloid-beta (AÎ²) protein has been a focus of
investigation for many years. Although very rare forms of early onset familial AD caused by mutations in APP
or processing-associated proteins PSEN1 and PSEN2 substantiate a role for AÎ² in the pathogenesis of AD,
most cases (>95%) have no definitive genetic cause. Many risk-associated genes (>26) have been identified,
but the role of most of them in AD pathogenesis remains very poorly understood. Microglia are resident innate
immune cells that mediate persistent neuroinflammatory responses to AÎ² protein characterized by increased
inflammatory cytokine production, synapse loss and neurotoxicity. Many of the identified risk-associated genes
appear to encode proteins that are expressed in microglia and involved in phagocytosis and endolysosomal
trafficking and proteolytic degradation, raising the possibility that fundamental abnormalities in microglia may
contribute to poor AÎ² processing and persistent neuroinflammation that leads to neurotoxicity and
neurodegeneration in AD.
 Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) is a very poorly studied risk-associated gene. Previous studies
published by us and strong preliminary data indicate that it has a significant role in AÎ² clearance from the brain
and in enhancing AÎ² protein phagocytosis, its endolysosomal trafficking and proteolytic degradation in
microglia. The project is outlined in three specific aims to: (1) examine the role of ACE specifically in microglia
in novel transgenic mice and in an animal model of AD, (2) examine the molecular mechanisms of ACE-
regulated gene expression in microglia and determine their role in phagocytosis, endolysosomal trafficking and
proteolytic degradation and (3) characterize the function of ACE in human induced microglia engrafted into
mice brains to study their response in vivo in a model of AD.
 Millions of humans are afflicted with AD, yet prevention and treatment remain very poor. We anticipate that
these studies focused on the AD risk-associated gene ACE and its role in AÎ² processing in microglia will
identify novel signaling pathways that enhance AÎ² protein processing. Moreover, we anticipate that these
studies may elucidate mechanisms in microglia that may be exploited to develop treatments to enhance AÎ²
proteostasis and mitigate neuroinflammation in the brain in AD."

A-PIMS), alcohol use, and adverse health outcomes. In HARP Project 1, we further explore alcohol and
polypharmacy (AP) risks using a direct alcohol biomarker (Phosphatidylethanol [PEth]), considering genetic
liability, and exploring associations with decompensated liver cirrhosis as a manifestation of alcohol-associated
liver disease (AALD). Polypharmacy and genetic liability also complicate selection of treatment for AUD. In
HARP Project 2, we use genetic liability and real-world data to identify and evaluate candidate medications in
the context of polypharmacy. Further, AP risks, especially genetic liability, are complex and challenging to
summarize. Both summarizing effects of multiple risk factors and using genetic data to identify medications for
repurposing requires large-scale, real-world data, high performance computing and sophisticated analytics.
With support from our Administrative/Data Analytic (ADA) Core, the Department of Energy (DOE), an extended
VA family of EHR cohorts (VACo Family), and an expanded network of experts, we are uniquely poised to
harness âbigâ data to personalize AP risks for PAH and evaluate medications for AUD. Finally, effective
communication of AP risk messages needs to be integrated into a comprehensive, theory-based behavior
change intervention. We have assembled a Risk Communication Core (RCC) of experts to facilitate risk
communication and motivational interviewing (MI) in our pilot intervention studies. The core includes Dr. Jeffrey
Fisher, co-developer of the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model of health behavior change. In
collaboration with Dr. Fisher, this core will guide our application of the IMB-MI model to communicate
personalized risk and other elements required for health behavior change in a linked series of pharmacist-
delivered pilot interventions. Project 1 pilots will compare patientâs responses to AP risk messages (employing
different measures of exposure and outcomes) delivered in the larger context of an IMB-MI intervention for
PAH who are at risk drinkers; Project 2 pilots will incorporate lessons learned in Project 1 and adapt the IMB-
MI intervention to target PAH with AUD, adding a candidate repurposed medication for AUD."

This proposal seeks to establish the Claude D Pepper Older Americans Independence Center
at UConn (UConn OAIC) with the overarching goal of developing clinical strategies for
enhancing function and independence in older adults that are more precise, personalized, and
effective. Our focus on Precision Gerontology has emerged through the collective experiences
and insights of our multidisciplinary team of accomplished investigators in the UConn Center on
Aging â all united by a shared commitment to improving the lives of older adults through
research, education, and clinical care.
Our emphasis on Precision Gerontology has been guided by three principles: 1. A growing
heterogeneity or variability over time among individuals involving all aspects of aging that
therefore necessitates a multidisciplinary team-based approach to aging research; 2. Increased
heterogeneity or variability with aging in older adultsâ responses to treatment, highlighting the
need for better targeting; and 3. Recognition of a need to incorporate these considerations into
the design and testing of novel geroscience-guided therapies.
These objectives will be achieved by establishing a UConn OAIC through the coordinated
activities of a Leadership and Administration Core (LAC), Recruitment and Community
Engagement Core (RC1), Data Resource Core (RC2), Biomarker and Preclinical Research
Core (RC3), Pilot and Exploratory Studies Core (PESC), and Research Education Component
(REC).
We will seek to address these goals through the following aims:
Aim 1: To develop and refine new approaches to the study and clinical translation of Precision
Gerontology.
Aim 2: To develop and evaluate new research methods, techniques, and collaborative
 approaches required to advance the goals of Precision Gerontology.
Aim 3: To identify, develop, and learn from experiences of the next generation of researchers
 poised to become leaders in geriatrics research related to the UConn OAIC focus.
Aim 4: To select and support innovative pilot studies that show promise in helping to guide the
 design, funding, and completion of more definitive future research studies related to the
 UConn OAIC focus."
10884085,"SUMMARY
Alzheimer's disorder (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease and the most common
cause of dementia. There are approximately six million Americans with AD and 29.8 million
worldwide, making AD one of the most pressing public health issues as the world's population
continues to age. Presently, there is no known effective prevention or cure exists, and current AD
medications only alleviate symptoms or slow decline rates. The landscape of AD drug trials is
gloomy. One possible reason is that AD is a heterogeneous disorder but trials are designed
treating it as a monolithic disease. Although lifestyle and environmental risk factors clearly affect
AD, the primacy of genetic influences suggests that categorization by genetic basis should be
prioritized in developing effective interventions. Genetics can offer insights on risk prediction,
disease mechanism, and new therapeutic targets. Heritability of AD estimates range from 49-79%,
but the conventional single nucleotide variants (SNVs) identified to date only account for <50% of
AD heritability. Multiple studies have highlighted the roles of copy number variants (CNVs) in AD.
We hypothesize that a systematic investigation of genome-wide CNVs at the full spectrum (i.e.
small and large in size, common and rare in frequency, and coding and no-coding in genomic
regions) from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can further enhance the knowledge of AD
etiology and risk. Leveraging the rich resources from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project
(ADSP), we propose to focus on a large multi-ethnic WGS sample (n>17,000) composed of AD
cases and normal healthy elderly controls, and to (1) detect and genotype CNVs from WGS for
ADSP case-control samples; (2) perform association analysis to identify genome regions of CNVs
contributing to AD; and (3) conduct cross-ethnic association studies to find ethnic-shared or
ethnic-unique AD-associated CNVs. Successful completion of our aims will provide (i) the first
large-scale CNV investigation of AD genetics using WGS data; (ii) new CNV calling method for
WGS based on the current best practices; (iii) new CNV association strategies to address issue
of breakpoint non-alignment and enhance association power; (iv) multi-ethnic characterization of
shared and unique CNV risk factors for AD; and (v) optimized computational pipelines with open-
source code and released standardized images (e.g., Docker images and Bioconductor packages)
that are easily deployable in other large-scale WGS association projects."
10744242,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of this project is to determine the influence of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) on tumor evolution
and resistance and to validate a potential therapeutic strategy based on ecDNA inhibition. The existence of
ecDNA was first recognized through pioneering cytopathology studies by Arthur Spriggs over five decades
ago. We know that ecDNAs are largely a phenomenon of tumor cells, can be detected in nearly half of all solid
cancers, and frequently express oncogenes, making them vehicles for amplification of oncogene expression
and consequent tumorigenesis. Our studies in glioblastoma extend this knowledge, showing that ecDNAs are
highly pervasive and significantly increase intra-tumoral genomic heterogeneity. Despite this knowledge,
research into the mechanisms of ecDNA-driven tumorigenesis is largely non-existent. To advance ecDNA
research to the next level of understanding, we must now define its origins, replication mechanisms, and
strategies to target it for treatment. At this time, however, there are significant barriers to such studies, such as
the absence of profiling technologies and molecular tools to accurately detect and characterize these
oncogenic elements. The work proposed here will remove these barriers to progress. We hypothesize that
ecDNAs drive tumorigenesis beyond their role as oncogene activators, and that mechanisms of ecDNA
formation and replication could serve as potential therapeutic targets. To test our hypothesis, we will develop
methods to visualize and trace ecDNA in live cells and use these tools to define the mechanisms of ecDNA
localization and transfer within a tumor. We will functionally evaluate whether ecDNA mediated cis-regulation
of non-ecDNA gene transcription can be modulated to change tumor cell behavior. Finally, we will explore
whether pharmacological depletion of ecDNA affects tumor growth and maintenance in cellular and animal
model systems. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Develop CRISPR-based tracing tools for real-time imaging of
ecDNA dynamics; 2) Discovery and functional interrogation of ecDNA mediated oncogene activation; and 3)
Target ecDNA through inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), the enzyme responsible for generating the
deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates that are the building blocks of autosomal and extrachromosomal DNA.
Impact: This project is based on the conceptual innovation that ecDNAs are cancer-specific and cancer-
enabling genomic alterations. Despite the recognition of ecDNA decades ago, the function of these structures
and how to effectively target their genesis, is virtually uncharted territory. In addition to developing new, broadly
applicable, tools for ecDNA studies, the results of this work will provide novel insights into the characteristics,
behavior and replicative mechanism of ecDNA, and will assess whether ecDNA is an unexploited cancer cell
vulnerability that can be therapeutically exploited for patient benefit."

10923849,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION/ABSTRACT â OVERALL
 The development of effective therapies for glioblastoma (GBM) has been incredibly vexing with no new drug
approvals in over a decade. Therapeutic resistance in any one patient with GBM can be related to multiple factors
including extensive tumor cell infiltration into adjacent brain, molecular heterogeneity of tumor cell populations,
and heterogeneity of drug distribution. In order to understand and overcome these challenges, we have built a
highly productive, multi-disciplinary scientific team over the past decade with expertise spanning systems
biology, pharmacology, tumor biology, and animal models of GBM. In the proposed U19 Center application, we
will integrate this established cross-disciplinary translational science team with physician scientists in radiation
and medical oncology, neurosurgery and neuroradiology with a collective focus of translating novel therapeutic
strategies into highly effective therapies for patients with GBM.
 Impaired DDR enables the genomic instability required for tumorigenesis, and differences in DDR
functionality between tumor and normal tissue provides the fundamental rationale for using radiation therapy or
genotoxic drugs as anti-cancer therapies. Additional targeted pharmacologic disruption of DDR in tumors can
markedly enhance the efficacy of these cytotoxic therapies and widen the therapeutic window. In this context,
we have collaborated extensively with multiple pharmaceutical companies to evaluate various small molecule
DDR inhibitors and have developed significant preliminary data demonstrating profound combinatorial efficacy
for these drugs when combined with radiation or alkylating chemotherapy routinely used for GBM. Thus, the
initial focus for our Center is to optimize the clinical deployment of DDR inhibitors in combination with cytotoxic
therapies for GBM. A Pharmacology Core will support both pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD)
evaluations in animal models and human samples, and our Therapy Evaluation Core will support both pre-clinical
and clinical testing of novel therapeutic strategies. The Project and Core teams will work in close collaboration
to accomplish the goals of the Center, and this collaborative effort within the Center and across the broader
Glioma Therapeutics Network (GTN) will be coordinated by the Administrative Core."
10795733,"Project Summary/Abstract
A key question in tauopathy research is why some brain cell populations are significantly affected while others
are relatively spared. The long-term goal of this study is to understand this differential cell vulnerability and use
the knowledge to develop therapies that protect neural cells from tauopathy-related degeneration.
 Mutations in the MAPT gene that encodes Tau commonly cause extensive pathology in the forebrain,
with significant loss of frontal and temporal lobe cerebral cortical cells leading to behavioral, language and
cognitive deficits. However, a subset of MAPT mutations also cause significant degeneration of midbrain
dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra contributing to a parkinsonism phenotype. Furthermore, these cells
are connected: midbrain dopaminergic neurons widely innervate the prefrontal cortex and are reciprocally
innervated via cortico-striatal-nigral circuits. Why specific MAPT mutations significantly affect the midbrain in
addition to cortex while others do not, and how connectivity between these regions with the potential for
pathological tau spread may be involved, represent significant gaps in knowledge that we will address in this
proposed study.
 Over the past few years, we have helped create a large iPSC line collection from patients with familial
dementia due to mutations in the MAPT gene, including isogenic controls. Phenotypic analyses show MAPT
mutant and control iPSC-derived cerebral cortical cells are initially phenotypically similar but develop differences
with maturation that include increased tau aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation and vulnerability to several
stressors, associated with the mutation. However, to date, studies comparing forebrain and midbrain cell
population responses to MAPT mutations that differentially affect these brain regions have not been done. Such
comparisons have the potential to reveal common and unique molecular mechanisms that underlie cell
vulnerability.
 Our approach is to use human iPSC-derived 3D organoids, which recapitulate complex cell-cell
interactions in a human cell system and enable long-term culture over several months. We will create cortical
and midbrain organoids from two MAPT mutations that primarily affect cortex and two that affect both cortex and
midbrain, versus respective isogenic controls. In Aim 1 we will examine the impact of these MAPT mutations on
cell populations and gene expression over time using single cell transcriptomics to define how diverse cell types
respond to each mutation. In Aim 2, we will create assembloids of cortical and midbrain organoids to model the
circuitry between the regions and determine whether this connectivity alters patterns of cell vulnerability and
enables the spread of pathological tau from one region to another, depending on specific MAPT mutation. In Aim
3 we will probe the impact of stimulating tau degradation on differential cell vulnerability in cerebral cortex and
midbrain."

10910894,"As persons living with HIV (PLWH) live longer, approximately 50% will experience HIV-related cognitive
dysfunction, which may affect daily activities, contribute to morbidity and mortality, and increase the likelihood
of HIV transmission. Alcohol consumption among PLWH may further exacerbate long-term cognitive
dysfunction, with the presumed mechanism involving the gut microbiome, microbial translocation, systemic
inflammation, and ultimately neuroinflammation. However, there are many gaps in our understanding regarding
the specific pathophysiological mechanisms, and a need to offer interventions that are effective and acceptable
in helping PLWH to reduce drinking or to protect them against alcohol-related harm. The overarching goal of
this P01 is to identify and ultimately implement new/improved, targeted interventions that will improve
outcomes related to cognitive and brain dysfunction in persons with HIV who drink alcohol. The proposed P01
activity will extend our current line of research that forms the core of the Southern HIV & Alcohol Research
Consortium (SHARC). The specific aims of this P01 are to: 1) improve our understanding of the specific
mechanisms that connect the gut microbiome to cognitive and brain health outcomes in persons with HIV; 2)
evaluate interventions that are intended to reduce the impact of alcohol on brain and cognitive health in
persons with HIV; and 3) connect and extend the research activity from this P01 with the training programs and
community engagement activity in the SHARC. Our P01 will utilize two cores that provide infrastructure to two
Research Components (RC1, RC2). The two RC will together enroll 200 PLWH with at-risk drinking into clinical
trials that share common timepoints and outcome assessments. RC1 will compare two strategies to extend
contingency management to 60 days, using breathalyzers and wrist-worn biosensors to monitor drinking. RC2
uses a hybrid trial design to evaluate two biomedical interventions targeting the gut-brain axis. One intervention
is a wearable, transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulator that is hypothesized to stimulate the autonomic nervous
system, resulting in decreased inflammation and improved cognition. The other intervention is a probiotic
supplement intended to improve the gut microbiome in persons with HIV and alcohol consumption. All
participants in RC2, and a subset of those in RC1 will have neuroimaging at two timepoints. The Data Science
Core will provide data management and analytical support, and will analyze existing data and the data
collected from this P01 using a machine learning and AI approach to identify factors associated with
intervention success or failure. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership, clinical research and
recruitment infrastructure, and connection to the outstanding training programs, development opportunities,
and community engagement provided by the SHARC. Our community engagement with diverse populations,

11041683,"Trisomy 21 (T21) is the molecular cause of Oown syndrome (OS), the most common chromosomal 
abnormality in humans worldwide. Lung disorders represent an important cause of morbidity and 
mortality in people with OS. Recurrent respiratory infections are particularly common in these 
individuals and are often life-threatening. However, despite recent studies reporting immune 
dysregulation and interferon hyperactivity in individuals with OS, there is a critical gap in our 
understanding on how extra genetic material from chromosome 21 influences homeostatic  immune 
activity of the lung, and innate immune activation and mobilization of myeloid leukocytes, which 
are key mediators of acute immune response, to respiratory pathogens. Organs-on-chips are 
biomimetic, microfluidic, cell culture devices created with microchip manufacturing methods that 
contain continuously perfused hollow microchannels inhabited by living tissue cells arranged to 
simulate organ-level physiology. By recapitulating the multicellular architectures, tissue-tissue 
interfaces, chemical gradients, mechanical cues, and vascular perfusion of the body, these devices 
produce levels of tissue and organ functionality not possible with conventional two- dimensional or 
three-dimensional culture systems. They also enable high-resolution, real-time imaging and in vitro 
analysis of biochemical, genetic and metabolic activities of living cells in a functional tissue 
and organ context. The overarching goal of this project is to apply microengineering principles of 
organ-on-chip technology and develop a highly innovative and advanced, physiologically relevant 
model of organ-organ crosstalk to delineate impact of OS on homeostatic physiology of the lung and 
emulate clinically observed immune dysregulation due to T21. For this, we will create a 
microfluidically integrated murine multi-organ system that reproduces bone marrow (BM)-lung axis, 
using primary cells isolated from wild-type (WT) and Op(16)1/Yey mice (a murine model of OS). In 
parallel, to enable eventual translation of findings to humans, we will focus part of our efforts 
in generating human lung airway  epithelia, vascular endothelium and hematopoietic stem cells from 
induced pluripotent stem cells of healthy subjects and individuals with OS to recreate Lung and BM 
tissue in the integrated multi-organ chip system. We will utilize these murine and stem cell-based 
platforms to study how T21 affects normal functioning and biological responses of the lung airway 
epithelium and endothelium. Moreover, we will in real-time analyze inflammation development and 
innate immune cells mobilization in response to challenge with inhaled airborne influenza virus 
particles. Our central hypothesis is that this dynamic living microsystem can recapitulate innate 
immune dysregulation in OS, reveal a pulmonary exaggerated immune response to challenge with 
inhaled infective agents, and enable discovery of previously unknown pathologies in airway function 
in the context of a multi-organ physiologically linked system."
10883916,"Project Summary/Abstract
The discovery of brain-derived exosomes in the circulation has led to studies examining their role as potential
mediators as well as `liquid biopsies' for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Studies to date
appear promising but have several major limitations: performed in a limited number of archived samples at a
single time-point; ignore racial/ethnic, gender, and genetic disparities in ADRD; lack concurrent assessment of
established vascular and AD-related neuroimaging biomarkers paired with cognitive adjudication; and lastly,
these studies are mainly focused on neuron-derived exosomes to the exclusion of other cellular constituents of
the neurovascular unit (NVU). Further, recent studies have suggested that vascular disorders are associated
with multiple dementia-related pathologies; however, no study has been able to systematically characterize
plasma exosomes of NVU for biomarkers of ADRD and hypoxia. We have developed novel tools to isolate and
characterize exosomes derived from all key cell types of the brain NVU [neuron-derived exosomes (NDE),
astrocyte-derived exosomes (ADE), endothelial-derived exosomes (EDE), pericyte-derived exosomes (PDE)
and supporting cells microglial-derived exosomes (MDE) and oligodendrocyte-derived exosomes (ODE)]. We
detected and quantified ADRD biomarkers (e.g., AÎ²1-40, AÎ²1-42, and neurofilament light (NfL)) loaded in NVU
exosomes from Wake Forest AD Research Center participants and related their levels to ADRD neuroimaging
and biofluid biomarkers. Next, we seek to extend this approach to understand exosomal heterogeneity across
various ages, gender, and races/ethnic groups in ADRD. To this end, we will leverage the Multi-Ethnic Study
of Atherosclerosis Multisite Study of AD (MESA-MIND; R01AG058969, PI: Hughes) with a longitudinal
diverse cohort of older adults. MESA-MIND aims to elucidate the contribution of subclinical vascular disorders
to the ethnic disparities in ADRD. We will obtain blood samples from 1,000 participants representing the three
most common racial/ethnic groups in the US (White: 30%, African American: 40%; and Hispanics: 30%)
recruited to participate in both PET and MRI at three sites. The resources of MESA-MIND provide a unique
opportunity to advance our understanding of NVU derived exosomal biomarkers of the vascular and
AD specific contributions to dementia. Specific aims are: I. Quantify and relate ADRD biomarker levels in
NVU exosomes with cognition and neuroimaging biomarkers of ADRD. II. Relate hypoxia signature in NVU
exosomes with biofluid and neuroimaging biomarkers of ADRD. In both the aims, we will examine the
heterogeneity of NVU exosomal number and content across important subgroups in ADRD (cognitive status,
race/ethnicity, age, gender, and APOE-Îµ4), which we expect to modify the relationships with neuroimaging
biomarkers of ADRD (AÎ²-PET and MRI) and cognitive decline. Overall, the present study would lead to the
development of novel blood-based exosomal biomarker development for both hypoxia and AD pathology. NVU
exosomal biomarkers will also provide insight into the molecular links in the vascular contributions to ADRD."

10759409,"Summary, Overall (Thalamus in the middle: computations in multi-regional neural
circuits)
This collaborative project aims to uncover the logic of signal routing from subcortical areas to the frontal cortex
through the thalamus. The frontal cortex displays rich patterns of neural activity, which can be decomposed into
âactivity modesâ that correspond to specific aspects of behavior. Examples include the persistent activity
correlated with short-term memory and motor planning, and the rapidly oscillating activity during voluntary
movements. In this dynamical systems perspective of neural computation, complex behaviors correspond to
distinct sequences of cortical activity modes. However, the cortex does not generate these activity modes in
isolation, but instead is strongly and bidirectionally coupled to the thalamus, the central hub of the forebrain.
Most of thalamus is non- sensory (âhigher-orderâ), receiving subcortical input from the cerebellum, midbrain, and
hippocampus. Our central theory is that these subcortical signals flow through higher-order thalamus to reach
the frontal cortex, where they enable activity modes, update activity modes, and cause switching between
modes, akin to the âupdateâ and âresetâ signals in Long Short-Term Memory networks in machine learning.
However, most of what we know about thalamus comes from sensory systems, and our knowledge of
subcortexâ thalamusâ frontal cortex circuits is nascent. We still have only a rudimentary understanding of the
input and output circuits of higher-order thalamus, the morphology and molecular properties of thalamic neurons,
the circuit motifs that link subcortical input to cortical activity, and the engagement of these networks across the
frontal cortex. We bring together a team with expertise in modern high-throughput anatomy (Project 1, 2),
molecular neuroscience (Project 2, Molecular Science Core), cellular and synaptic neurophysiology (Project 3),
large-scale neurophysiology in mice performing behaviors that require short-term memory and decision-making
(Project 3, 4), and theory and computation (Project 5, Data Science Core). We will collaborate to uncover how
information flows from subcortical areas, through thalamus, to control cortical activity modes and thereby shape
behavior. Individual projects are guided by a conceptual framework of multi-regional neural computation, placing
the thalamus in the middle of a multi-regional neural network. Together, our work will have broad implications for
the understanding of neural computation in subcortexâ thalamusâ cortex circuits and will produce anatomy-
guided multi-regional circuit models of cognitive function. We will also produce paradigm-shifting community
resources, including quantitative anatomy, novel genetic reagents, neurophysiological data, and a rich modeling
framework, upon which future studies of thalamic circuits will be built."

focus on RPI is highlighted by our recent finding that any alcohol use among PWH with AUD is associated with
increased viremia and the well-established high relapse prevalence of 50 â 75% of persons in remission. Our
epidemiological project will provide outcomes data for the intervention trials as well as examine the full
spectrum of alcohol use, the Alc-CC and their relationship to HIV-CC, comorbidities and co-infections in the
context of social determinants of health. An administrative core provides the structure and processes to

10891756,"ABSTRACT
Alzheimerâs disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia (60-80%), affecting tens of millions of people
globally and, due to longer lifespans and aging populations, perhaps hundreds of millions more by 2050. AD
pathology is first observed in allocortical and limbic areas within the cerebrum, in particular medial temporal
cortical regions critical for learning and memory including the hippocampal formation and entorhinal cortex
(HIP-EC). Within these areas, pathology exhibits subregional and cell type specificity, with layer 2 of
entorhinal cortex and the hippocampal CA1 field (Sommerâs sector) exhibiting pathological hallmarks before
dentate gyrus granule cells and other major hippocampal neuronal subtypes. Understanding the molecular
basis of this selective vulnerability (and conversely the resilience of other cell types) will provide new insights
into the etiology of AD, but to date only limited efforts have been made to understand the molecular signatures
differentiating neuronal and non-neuronal cells in HIP-EC. We therefore propose to conduct single nuclear
RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and single nuclear Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin (snATAC-
seq) in 5 regions of HIP-EC of AD brains, young/mid adult and aged neurotypical âcontrolâ human brains, and
young adult and aged rhesus macaque brains. This will allow us to develop a high resolution cell census of
HIP-EC which will in turn allow us to identify enriched genes, gene expression patterns, gene regulatory
networks, and biological processes potentially mediating cell type specific differences in the AD and aged
HIP-EC."
10916402,"CSUF/UCI-CFCCC Cancer Health Equity Research Partnership (CHERP)
 Overall Component: Abstract
California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) is an institution serving underserved populations and
underrepresented students (ISUPS), and the University of California, Irvine Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer
Center (UCI-CFCCC) is an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center. Together, we plan to establish a
collaborative partnership to develop pilot research projects between faculty members at CSUF and UCI-CFCCC
that will generate preliminary data for R01 or other competitively funded grant applications, and educate
undergraduates (at CSUF) and master's students (at CSUF and UCI) in cancer health disparities research. The
Partnership plans to fund five pilot projects, and educate a total of 38 students during the length of the proposed
grant period. The overall specific aims of this new cancer-specific partnership are to: plan, implement and
evaluate a highly integrated and interactive cancer health disparities partnership between CSUF and UCI-
CFCCC; conduct pilot cancer health disparities research projects involving at least one investigator at each
institution that advance knowledge regarding cancer health disparities, leading to the submission of competitive
grant applications by NIH/NCI and other federal/non-federal agencies; and provide cancer research education
to underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students to increase their understanding of cancer health
disparities, leading to a larger pool of highly talented future scientists from diverse backgrounds.
To accomplish this we will undertake a set of activities organized under four components. The Administrative
Core will be responsible for the overall administrative and fiscal aspects of all P20 activities, and will include the
Executive Committee and Internal Advisory Committee. Activities will be implemented in three stages: initial
planning, implementation, and evaluation. The evaluation effort will be spearheaded by an external evaluator
with expertise in multi-component center reviews. The two pilot research projects each focus on a cancer health
disparity: the first is a basic science study that will conduct lipidomic profiling, and DNA and RNA sequencing of
tumor/NAT paired samples to optimize sample preparation and detect genetic/genomic and transcriptomic
differences that are related to African American triple negative breast cancer risk. The second is an
epidemiological study that will examine Asian sub-ethnic group differences in ovarian cancer mortality and
treatment patterns. The long term goals of this collaborative partnership are to diversity the cancer research
workforce and ultimately increase our scientific impact to address the cancer health disparity needs in Orange
County, California."
10884100,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimerâs disease and Alzheimerâs disease related dementias pose an enormous public health challenge. In
the absence of a cure, prevention or delay of pathology offers the most promising avenue to control the
disease. Despite growing recognition that cardiometabolic risk factors are major contributors to cognitive
decline, Alzheimerâs disease, and Alzheimerâs disease related dementias, many gaps remain in our
understanding of the mechanisms and pathways between glucose homeostasis and cognitive function. While
type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasingly recognized as a major preventable risk factor for Alzheimerâs disease and
related dementias, intensive glucose control in T2D has not been shown to prevent cognitive decline in trials.
This finding and inconsistent results for the influence of glucose control (HbA1c) on cognitive decline pose the
question: What aspects of dysglycemia, and its inverse glucose homeostasis, increase the risk of
Alzheimerâs disease or related dementias? This studyâs overall goal is to investigate the role of dysglycemia
across the glucose spectrum on incident neurocognitive markers of Alzheimerâs disease and Alzheimerâs
disease related dementias in a multi-ethnic cohort: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). MESA
enrolled 6814 men and women beginning in 2000. MESA participants have been extensively studied with
respect to cardiovascular risk factors and outcomes and MESA-MIND, a cognitive ancillary, adds
comprehensive cognitive testing and neuroimaging including brain MRI and amyloid Î² PET scans. MESA has
a 7th exam occurring between 2021-2023 that will be concordant with the second MESA-MIND visit. While
fasting glucose was obtained at every exam, and HbA1C and HOMA-IR measured at some exams, continuous
glucose has not been measured. Adding continuous glucose monitoring wearable technology to MESA Exam
7 and repeated two years later provides a unique and timely opportunity to answer challenging questions about
the role of dysglycemia that continue to impede the development of successful prevention strategies for
Alzheimerâs disease and Alzheimerâs disease related dementias. This study will also add new measurements
of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). This ancillary to MESA will 1) Investigate the antecedent determinants of
glucose homeostasis (from continuous glucose monitors at Exam 7 (n=2000) and change over two years
(n=1000), 2. Determine whether continuous glucose markers of glucose homeostasis, dysglycemia, and
change over time are associated with incident neurocognitive indicators of Alzheimerâs disease or Alzheimerâs
disease related dementias (n=2000), and 3. Investigate the contributions of dysglycemia to Alzheimerâs
disease and related dementia pathologies by sex and race/ethnicity (n=2000). Findings from this research will
identify new mechanisms for the development of Alzheimerâs disease and Alzheimerâs disease related
dementias, discover new primary and secondary prevention targets, and have the potential to change clinical
care."

11015949,"Project Summary
The goal of our study is to better understand the pathogenic role of human microglia in Alzheimerâs disease (AD)
in Down syndrome (DS) and develop new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of AD in DS as well as AD in
general population. Our studies are in line with the goals of RFA-OD-20-005 because we will focus on evaluating
the genetic factors associated with trisomy 21 and their impacts on neurodegeneration using human tissue and
a novel human-mouse chimeric brain model and we will also use gene editing to remove triplicated genes. The
foundation of our studies is that recent genome-wide association studies have shown that many AD risk genes
are highly and sometimes exclusively expressed by the brain-resident macrophage, microglia. Recent
transcriptomic studies have also clearly demonstrated that human vs. mouse microglia exhibit distinct gene
expression profiles, and more importantly, they age differently under both normal and diseased conditions. These
findings argue for the utilization of species-specific research tools to investigate microglial functions in human
brain aging and degeneration. We propose to use a novel human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based
microglial chimeric mouse model that can recapitulate features of adult and aging human microglia to investigate
the role of human microglia in AD in DS. While the aggregation of amyloid-beta (Ab) precedes that of tau, tau
protein pathology commences in humans much sooner than was previously thought. Contrary to the marked
microglial activation reported in amyloidogenic transgenic mouse models, in human brain tissue derived from
AD and DS patients, brain regions particularly relevant in AD development, such as the hippocampal formation,
exhibit low and late Ab pathology, whereas hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) accumulates starting in the early
stages of the disease. The preferential accumulation of p-tau over Ab plaques could induce a totally different
microglial response. Here we put forward a new tau/microglial senescence hypothesis that human microglial
senescence and functional changes, induced by soluble p-tau, likely occur prior to neurodegeneration and is
causatively linked to the AD progression and cognitive decline in DS. We have created control and DS microglial
mouse chimeras by engrafting control and DS hiPSC-derived microglia into mouse brains. We will characterize
the dynamic responses of DS and control hiPSC-derived microglia to pathological soluble p-tau in human
microglial chimeric mouse brains, by using newly invented robotic four-dimensional long-term imaging
technology. We will determine the changes in synaptic functions by electrophysiological recordings and
behavioral performance of DS microglial chimeras after exposure to pathological soluble p-tau, as compared to
control microglial chimeras. Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of chimeric mouse brains and
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated removal of triplicated genes will be performed to determine the molecular mechanisms
underlying the pathogenic role of microglia. By understanding the underpinning mechanisms, we can develop
new therapeutic strategies to prevent human microglial senescence to slow the progression of AD in DS."
10908485,"The overarching theme for this program project grant (PPG) is that alcohol associated gut dysbiosis and gut
dysbiotic metabolites are cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors among people living with HIV infection
(PLWH) who are heavy drinkers. The goals of this research are (1) to determine if a tailored probiotic (i.e.,
contains bacteria supporting butyrate synthesis) can mitigate alcohol associated gut dysbiosis and lower levels
of microbial translocation, inflammation, and improve harmful dysbiotic metabolite profiles (e.g. trimethylamine
N oxide, TMAO) and (2) to determine if these metabolites are associated with incident CVD and death among
PLWH. We hypothesize that, among PLWH, a probiotic vs. placebo can mitigate alcohol associated gut
dysbiosis and lower levels of microbial translocation, inflammation, and improve metabolite profiles (Project 1
RCT, n=250); and that harmful alterations of these metabolites will be associated with higher risk of incident
CVD and death (Project 2 Cohort, n=2,900). Project 1 will be conducted at Pavlov State Medical University in
St. Petersburg, Russia, the same site as our gut microbiome and metabolite studies (ACME HIV and TMAO
HIV). Project 2 will leverage the Veterans Aging Cohort Study, an observational cohort of veterans living with
and without HIV. The Projects will be supported by our Administrative Core at Vanderbilt University Medical
Center and the Integrated Metagenomics and Metabolomics Core at the University of Louisville's Alcohol
Research Center (ULARC). The latter is the core for ACME HIV and will generate the metagenomics and
metabolomics for this PPG. The former will coordinate all study projects/cores and integrate the Vanderbilt
SCHolars in HIV and Heart, Lung, Blood, and Sleep ReSearch NIH K12 training program into the PPG. Our
preliminary data: (1) HIV infection is a CVD risk factor; (2) inflammation is associated with increased risk of
CVD among PLWH; (3) among PLWH, heavy drinking is associated with increased CVD risk and correlated
with measures of gut dysbiosis, characterized by loss of butyrate producing bacteria; (4) gut dysbiosis among
PLWH who are heavy drinkers is correlated with higher levels of inflammation, TMAO, and adverse bile acid
metabolite profiles; and (5) ULARC data in murine models show heavy drinking causes dysbiosis, that
dysbiosis leads to increased biomarker levels of inflammation, and that probiotic administration targeting
alcohol-associated gut dysbiosis attenuates the rise in these inflammatory biomarkers even in the presence of
alcohol consumption. Cross project validation: Biospecimens from Project 1 will be used to validate
significant findings in Project 2. Metabolites significantly associated with alcohol and CVD in Project 2, will be
explored in Project 1 to see if probiotics favorably impact the levels of those metabolites. The Microbiome,
METabolites, and Alcohol in HIV to reduce CVD (META HIV CVD) PPG will inform probiotics' role as standard
adjunctive therapy complementing alcohol interventions among PLWH who are heavy drinkers and advance
the understanding of how alcohol associated gut dysbiosis and its metabolites contribute to CVD and death."

10927430,"SHARE P01 ABSTRACT
The purpose of the SHARE P01 research program project is to address HIV and alcohol use around three
themes; 1) Emerging adulthood (ages 18 -29); 2) Self-management of HIV and alcohol; and 3) Translational
behavioral science. Emerging adulthood is a developmental stage marked by significant change in social
roles, expectations as a new adult, and increased responsibilities. It is also marked by poor HIV self-
management and increased alcohol use. Emerging adults with HIV (hereafter called young people living with
HIV; YPLWH) may face even more challenges given intersectional stigma. This age group continues to have
very high rates of new HIV infections. Interventions designed specifically for the unique developmental
challenges of emerging adults are needed, yet emerging adults are often included with older adults in
intervention programs. The concept of self-management emerged concurrently within both the substance
abuse and chronic illness literatures, and fits well with the developmental challenges of emerging adulthood.
Self-management, a framework we have utilized in our work with YPLWH, refers to the ability to manage
symptoms, treatments, lifestyle changes, and consequences of health conditions. Current research now
identifies individual-level self-management skills such as self-control, decision-making, self-reinforcement, and
problem solving as that protect against substance use and improve other health outcomes and can be
embedded in the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model. Although we have conducted multiple
studies with YPLWH, only one intervention to date (Healthy Choices conducted by our team) improved both
alcohol use and viral suppression in YPLWH in large trials. The goal of the SHARE P01 is to utilize advances
in translational behavioral science to optimize behavioral interventions and define new developmentally- and
culturally-appropriate intervention targets to improve self-management of alcohol and HIV in YPLWH. We will
focus our efforts in Florida, a state hardest hit by the HIV epidemic but with a particularly strong academic-
community partnership to support translation. We have assembled research teams to conduct self-
management studies across the translational spectrum to address self-management and improve alcohol use
and viral suppression (and thereby reduce transmission) in diverse YPLWH in Florida. The P01 will consist of
three research projects (DEFINE, ENGAGE, and SUSTAIN), representing different stages on the translational
spectrum and targeting different core competencies, supported by two cores (Community Engagement Core
and Data Science Core). If successful, the SHARE P01 has the potential to greatly advance programs
promoting self-management of HIV and alcohol use among a particularly vulnerable, but under-researched
group, emerging adults living with HIV. SHARE also has a high potential for scale-up and implementation
beyond Florida and across the United States."
10910087,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Immunotherapy holds great promise for the treatment of glioblastoma; still, certain characteristics of glioblastoma
present inherent therapeutic challenges. Herein, two experienced interdisciplinary laboratory and clinical teams
at UCSFs Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center and Northwestern University's Robert H. Lurie
Comprehensive Cancer Center join efforts to develop innovative immunotherapy approaches against
glioblastoma. This proposal leverages industry and institutional support to address three specific objectives: 1)
to improve our understanding of the role of immunotherapy approaches in glioblastoma; 2) to improve our
understanding of how to overcome the limitation the blood brain barrier and 3) to develop innovative
immunotherapy treatments for glioblastoma, with associated early clinical trials focused on patients suffering
from recurrent glioblastoma.
Project 1, coordinated from Northwestern, will build on the team's preclinical results in mouse brain tumor models
demonstrating an immunomodulatory and sensitization effect when immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy is
preceded by a immunogenic dose of doxorubicin, an effect that can be further enhanced by ultrasound-based
BBB opening. Support by innovative biotech companies (Agenus, AstraZeneca, Carthera) provide drugs or
devices for preclinical and clinical investigation as well as specific expertise, assays and technology for
investigations at both institutions, making this collaboration a very powerful consortium. The ensuing clinical trial
will investigate the novel anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor balstilimab in conjunction with doxorubicin, with and
without sonication for BBB opening. By administration of immune therapy prior to surgery (induction therapy,
neoadjuvant treatment) the immune effect enables us to evaluate in vivo immune response in the resected brain
tissue. We have previously identified pERk/MAPK activation as a biomarker for benefit from anti-PD1 treatment
in recurrent glioblastoma; this and other markers will be explored furthermore. Four prospectively treated cohorts
will be treated with and without induction therapy, and with and without BBB opening. Translational endpoints
include immune response (tumor tissue, peripheral) and drug tissue concentration.
Project 2, coordinated from UCSF, is a study based on the exciting novel synthetic Notch âsynNotchâ receptor
CART system and pioneering T cell circuits that recognize tumor cells based on a âprime-and-killâ strategy. In
this system, the first antigen, which is expressed exclusively on GBM cells (EGFRvIII), primes the T cells to
induce expression of a CAR that recognizes IL-13RÎ±2 and EphA2, thereby eradicating GBM cells expressing
either EphA2 or IL-13Î±2. Project 2's team hypothesizes that synNotch CART cells can revolutionize the CART
therapy for glioblastoma by overcoming the challenges of off-tumor toxicity, antigen heterogeneity, and CART
cell exhaustion. Thus, these synNotch-CART cells are hypothesized to be significantly more efficacious than
conventional, constitutively expressed IL-13RÎ±2/EphA2 CART cells. Investigators will optimize the efficacy of
the lead agent and test this hypothesis in the first in human clinical trial of this new class of agents in glioblastoma
patients.
This U19 proposal also has set aside funds for support of the distinctly important trans-GTN pilot projects, and
for two cores (Administrative, Immune Monitoring & Biospecimen) that will support the efforts of the two projects.
By addressing the overall specific objectives described, the research proposed in this U19 application has a high
likelihood of changing the way immunotherapy is understood and utilized in glioblastoma. The innovative
research described in this proposal will take advantage of the exceptional resources assembled by the well-
established, collaborative group of clinical and basic scientists at UCSF and Northwestern."
10984955,"Project Abstract
Alzheimerâs disease (AD) affects over 5.7 million Americans and is expected to rise to nearly 14 million people
by 2060, as the number of people living with this disease doubles every 5 years. AD is a progressive and
severely debilitating disease that negatively affects cognitive and memory function and is linked to increased
disability in everyday functioning and risk of mortality. Neurodegeneration of focal brain areas in AD
progressively impacts large-scale brain circuits, leading to significant cognitive and behavioral impairments.
However, little is known regarding aberrant context-dependent dynamic causal interactions between
distributed brain regions, and their links to cognitive and memory impairments and neuropathology,
across AD clinical stages. Leveraging a productive and high-impact line of research in the current project
period, we now propose to address critical gaps in our knowledge of functional circuit mechanisms underlying
cognitive dysfunction in AD using innovative computational tools. Our first major goal is to continue to
address critical unmet needs in human brain research by developing and validating novel computational tools
for identifying context-dependent dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. Building
on progress in the current project period, we will further develop novel Multivariate Dynamic Systems
Identification-Hamiltonian Monte Carlo techniques taking advantage of recent advances in Bayesian modeling
and inferencing. Our computational tools will be validated using optogenetic stimulation with whole-brain
fMRI, and stability analysis of normative Human Connectome Project data. Our second major goal is to use
MDSI-HMC to investigate aberrancies in dynamic causal circuits underlying cognitive and memory
impairment in AD. Our system neuroscience approach will target four key brain systems implicated in AD:
default mode network, medial temporal lobe, and two frontal control systems anchored in the frontoparietal and
salience networks. To achieve our goals, we will leverage clinical, phenotypic, cognitive, experimental, and
state-of-the-art fMRI, and beta amyloid (AÎ²) and tau PET, data from multiple NIH-funded AD-specific
Human Connectome Projects. Our proposed studies will advance foundational knowledge of cognitive and
memory-related circuits across AD clinical stages and their links to neuropathology. More generally, our
proposed studies will also contribute novel tools for examining dynamical causal circuits underlying human
brain function and dysfunction. The proposed studies are highly relevant to the NIH Focus on AD and PAR-
10-070 which call for innovative characterization of functional brain circuits altered in AD. More broadly,
the proposed studies are relevant to the mission of the NIH to encourage development and dissemination of
innovative advanced computational tools for clinical neuroscience. We will disseminate our algorithms and
software tools to the research community as we have done in the current project period."

The immune system is important for protection against infection, cancers, allergy, and autoimmunity.
There is significant interindividual variation in the ability to mount an effective immune response that
is driven by both genetic and environmental factors. Evidence shows that underlying variation in
immune homeostasis may influence the immune response to challenge. However, the identity of
specific genes involved, and mechanism of action are largely unknown. Additionally, the interplay
between environmental stressors, genetic variation, and aging is largely understudied. The long-term
goal of this study is to understand how genetic and environmental mechanisms regulate immune
homeostasis, how this regulation changes with age, and how those factors contribute to the immune
response to infection. Our lab has previously shown that genetic diversity substantially contributes to
variation in immune responses. Further, weâve shown that this could be mediated through changes in
the homeostatic immune environment. Here, we propose that Methyl-CpG binding domain protein 1
(MBD1) is a regulator of effector B cell differentiation at homeostasis (Aim 1). In this aim we seek to
elucidate the mechanism by which MBD1 regulates B cell differentiation and assess how allelic
variation at Mbd1 alters its functions both in vitro and in vivo. Most studies of immune homeostasis
are performed in specific-pathogen free mouse models, whose immune systems largely reflect that of
a neonatal human. To address this in the context of immune homeostasis, we will examine the
contributions of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and age to the immune environment in the lungs. Here, we
ask whether aging associated changes in the immune environment in the lungs is modified with CMV
infection, latency, and/or reactivation. Further, we will investigate whether these changes contribute to
improved immune responses to respiratory infections in aged mice (Aim 2). Data generated through
this proposal will shed new light on how immune homeostasis is modified with genetic variation, prior
immune exposure, and age, and will improve our understanding of the role that these factors play in
response to infection."
10753480,"Project Summary
Differences in cognitive information processing of threat information have been linked with almost every
major psychiatric illness, from anxiety to psychosis to PTSD. And yet, objective, performance-based
measures of such threat sensitivity tend to be (1) unreliable, (2) difficult to scale, and (3) designed for
assessing differences in phenotypic traits rather than characteristics that vary over time. Self-reported
experiences linked with threat processing (e.g. anxiety, hypervigilance, fear), on the other hand, tend to
fluctuate over minutes, hours, and days within individuals. The lack of brief, sensitive, reliable, and
repeatable measures of threat sensitivity thus represents a major gap in our ability to understand how
threat sensitivity is related to mental health, between individuals and over time. The overall goal of the
proposed project is to develop and validate a battery of optimized and generalizable measures for
assessing between and within-person differences in threat sensitivity, for use in high throughput or high
frequency assessment designs. The proposed work is organized around three specific aims. Aim 1 is to
identify and optimize a set of 5 reliable candidate measures, based on an initial set of 25. We will select
and develop measures based on an iterative test development approach, using high-throughput
assessment in N = 75,000 participants to identify parameters, stimuli, and administration characteristics
that allow us to meet pre-specified psychometric and validation benchmarks across device types (see
Research Strategy). Measures that achieve these benchmarks will then be carried over to two large-scale
EMA validation studies: (1) a sample recruited from an acute psychiatric care setting at McLean Hospital
(Aim 2, N = 200) and (2) a diverse Bronx-biased community sample (Aim 3, N = 400). Successful
completion of this project will yield a set of high-quality measures that are validated for research using
both high throughput and high frequency assessment study designs (e.g. EMA), particularly research that
seeks to characterize the temporal dynamics of threat processing or state-related differences in cognition
and symptoms. The proposed research is significant because it will (1) address a critical gap in our ability
to objectively measure cognitive information processing of threat in field test settings, and (2) provide
robust tools for tracking changes in threat sensitivity over time. The proposed research is innovative in
that it (a) employs an iterative test development approach that will allow us to rapidly select and optimize
potential test candidates, administered in naturalistic environments, and (b) allows us to capture both
between and within-subject variability as potential avenues for identifying mechanisms that contribute to
mental disorders Our team is uniquely positioned to accomplish these aims, given our expertise in
developing and evaluating mobile cognitive assessments, psychometrics, fear and threat information
processing, and infrastructure for disseminating cognitive measures in large cohorts and nationally."

This is a partnership between Hampton University (HU) and the Tisch Cancer Institute (TCI) at
Mount Sinai School of Medicine that seeks to establish robust collaborations on-site and online
training and education to increase HU facultyâs research capacity in the area of genetics and
genomics and health disparities, while increasing TCI research in health disparities, using the
examples of prostate and breast cancer. The final goal is to create a competitive and sustainable
joint Center for Genetics and Genomics Cancer Research, encompassing the genetics and
genomics aspects of health disparities to explain population differences in breast and prostate
cancer occurrence and outcome. The proposal is grounded in a longstanding and productive
undergraduate educational collaboration between faculty at these two institutions, but is distinct
in its focus, methods, and goals. Hence, the proposed program will utilize the best practices
learned from previous collaborative endeavors to inform and create an innovative platform which
will enhance research capacity at both institutions while addressing key institutional challenges.
Our goals will be accomplished through a series of well-coordinated training/educational activities
and two pilot research projects that were strategically chosen to meet our overarching goals of 1)
improving health outcomes in vulnerable populations, 2) addressing gaps in cancer disparities
research, 3) augmenting genomic, statistics, epidemiology expertise and 4) enhancing
investigator productivity and extramural funding competitiveness. Training and education will aim
to increase HU facultyâs research capacity in the area of genetics and genomics and health
disparities, using the examples of prostate and breast cancer. It will provide TCI ISMMS with
access and collaboration to scientific projects in breast and prostate cancer disparity etiology,
treatment and outcome, as well as to a mechanism to increase the diversity of the genetics and
genomics faculty, which has traditionally lacked diversity. To ensure the success of the training
and education program, we have assembled an excellent team of faculty with outstanding
mentoring and teaching track records, along with extensive expertise in developing and
implementing new initiatives aimed at diversifying the clinical investigator workforce and
eliminating health disparities. HU faculty will also be exposed to the most novel and cutting edge
methods in cancer genomics through the completion of the pilot research project."
10747281,"Studies initially pioneered in my lab and subsequent work by us and others established that IL-2 is an essential
cytokine for the development, homeostasis and function of regulatory T cells (Tregs). We have further
established in mouse models that low levels of IL-2R signaling effectively promote Treg but not T effector (Teff)
cells. These findings have helped in the clinical translation of low-dose IL-2 as a Treg-targeted therapy for
autoimmunity. Moreover, serious autoimmune-related side effects frequently occur as a consequence of
checkpoint blockade during cancer immunotherapy, raising the possibility that low-dose IL-2 might alleviate
these unwanted responses. In spite of this progress, we still have a poor understanding of the mechanisms by
which IL-2 controls peripheral Tregs. Recently, we have developed several novel mouse models that vary IL-
2R signaling in Tregs. In one model (NOD-Y3), IL-2R signaling strength was lowered approximately 3-fold in
Tregs in NOD mice, which accelerated diabetes. In another model, CD25 (IL-2RÎ±) was selectively abrogated in
peripheral Tregs (CD25iKO mice), where all peripheral Tregs require IL-2R signaling for their survival. Our
genome-wide expression studies suggests homeostasis of Tregs is impaired in the absence of IL-2R signaling
due to decreased cholesterol biosynthesis that alters Treg metabolism and to lower expression of anti-
apoptotic Bcl-2 that favors apoptosis. Although Treg suppressive function depends on IL-2R signaling,
definitive data for this notion comes from studies where IL-2R signaling is impaired during thymic development.
The suppressive activity of peripheral Tregs that have not responded to IL-2 remains unknown. Moreover,
current models suggest that IL-2R signaling is primarily required for the homeostasis of resting or central Tregs
(cTregs) while TCR signaling controls activated or effector Treg (eTregs). However, we found that the eTreg
subset cannot survive without IL-2. Thus, the role of IL-2 for eTregs remains unclear. Our studies also indicate
that reduced, but not absent, IL-2R signaling at the level of Tregs is sufficient to promote autoimmune-
mediated diabetes in NOD mice. However, IL-2-dependent processes that are impaired within the islets of the
pancreas to accelerate diabetes are poorly understood. We plan to build on these results and capitalize on our
expertise on the IL-2R to address these issues and better understand mechanistically the basis by which IL-2R
signaling regulates Treg homeostasis and promotes susceptibility to autoimmunity. The following aims are
proposed: 1) To establish the gene signatures for peripheral Treg subsets that depend on IL-2R, STAT5 and
mTORC1 signaling; 2) To determine the relative roles of IL-2R, STAT5 and mTORC1 signaling for survival and
metabolic function, including the contribution of lipid biosynthesis and Bcl-2, for the homeostasis of peripheral
Treg subsets; 3) To define the extent absent IL-2R, STAT5, and mTORC1 signaling alters Treg function and to
determine the cellular and molecular basis by which reduced, not absent, IL-2R signaling in Tregs promotes
autoimmunity in NOD mice."
10883894,"Alzheimerâs disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD), age-related cognitive decline, stroke, and heart
disease are pressing public health problems with high prevalence in racial/ethnic minority older adults. Building
on our strong cross-sectional findings linking greenness exposure (vegetative presence) to lower rates of
chronic diseases -- including AD, cardiometabolic indicators (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia), heart
disease and stroke -- we propose to investigate neighborhood greenness exposure as a novel environmental
protective factor for cognitive decline and vascular outcomes (stroke, myocardial infarction [MI] and vascular
death). The proposed study will be the first to investigate prospectively and longitudinally: 1) the relationship of
cumulative greenness exposure to cognitive performance and vascular outcomes; 2) the mediating roles of
behavioral, cardiometabolic, novel inflammatory/infectious and novel vascular brain imaging biomarkers in the
relationship of cumulative greenness exposure to cognitive performance and vascular outcomes; and, 3) for
whom (individual moderators) and under what conditions (neighborhood moderators) greenness has its impact
on cognitive performance and vascular outcomes. We will also examine 4) the longitudinal relationship of
cumulative greenness exposure to brain reserve; and 5) the moderating effect of brain reserve in the
relationship of greenness to cognitive resilience/performance. Finally, we will 6) explore in post-hoc analyses
the relationship of cumulative greenness exposure to adjudicated MCI, AD and ADRD.
 This proposal builds on the Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS), a prospective cohort that focuses on risk
factors for stroke and cognitive decline in a multi-ethnic/multi-racial aging population. The study of cognitive
performance trajectories will be conducted using cognitive performance assessments conducted at three time
points (over 10 years minimum) in 1,290 NOMAS participants (with magnetic resonance imaging at baseline).
The study of vascular outcomes will include all 3,298 NOMAS participants over ~14 years. Mediating pathways
include: 1. Behavioral measures (physical activity; social support); 2. cardiometabolic biomarkers (blood
pressure; fasting glucose; BMI; waist circumference); 3. novel inflammatory biomarkers (IL6, TNFR1); and, 4.
novel vascular brain imaging biomarkers (white matter hyper-intensity volume, silent brain infarction, cortical
thickness). Moderators (for whom and under what conditions) include age, race/ethnicity, sex, education and
APOE status, neighborhood income, walkability and crime.
 Several factors enable us to efficiently and cost-effectively conduct the study, including the rich array of
NOMAS data in a diverse sample; availability of archived data on built, natural and social environmental factors
for NYC; collaboration of NOMAS study PIs and co-investigators to facilitate smooth data access; and an
established and experienced interdisciplinary team of architects and urban planners, biostatisticians, cognitive

10884105,"ABSTRACT
In Alzheimer's disease (AD), decreased activity of the constitutive form of proteasomes has been reported in the
regions affected by amyloid plaque load and tau accumulation. In contrast to neurons, glial cells, besides
expressing constitutive proteasomes, they express at basal levels specialized type of proteasomes called the
immunoproteasomes that exhibit a higher rate of protein degradation compared to constitutive proteasomes.
Upon inflammatory stimuli, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-Î³ or under oxidative stress, the expression
of the immunoproteasome subunits is increased, whereby three catalytic constitutive proteasome subunits (Î²5,
Î²1, and Î²2) are exchanged for immunoproteasome subunits Î²5i, Î²1i, and Î²2i and their proteolytic activities
produce a distinct set of peptides for MHC Class I receptors and T-cell activation.
Because immunoproteasomes are induced during neuroinflammation (the immune response) and oxidative
stress (the non-immune response) in glial cells, their pathophysiological significance in AD is debated. It remains
unclear whether immunoproteasomes, as part of cytokine inflammatory responses, contribute to the etiology of
the AD progression. Or whether the biogenesis of immunoproteasomes that exhibit enhanced activity compared
to constitutive proteasomes is part of a compensatory mechanism in activated glial cells to overcome
inflammatory signals and protein accumulation during oxidative stress.
The goal of the project is to elucidate the functional diversity of immunoproteasome across the tauopathy and
AD knock-in mouse models by generating crosses with double deficient immunoproteasome model (L7M1) -
(Aim 1). Moreover, utilizing single-nucleus RNA-sequencing and mass spectrometry-based quantitative
proteomics, we aim to identify changes at the transcriptome and the proteome levels impacted by deficient
immunoproteasomes in mice - (Aim 2). Elucidating the mechanisms of the neuro-glial feedback loop and the
role of glial cells in the propagation of tau across neurons is the topic of Aim 3. Understanding the true nature of
immunoproteasomes in AD is vital because its proteolytic activity and its biogenesis can be exploited
pharmacologically as a novel therapeutic target against AD."
10884102,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Presently, no established biomarker exists to robustly predict the clinical manifestation of cognitive symptoms
in persons with Alzheimerâs disease (AD) and AD-related dementias. PET and MRI brain biomarkers are costly
and invasive, thus there is a critical need for a noninvasive, inexpensive, and portable AD screening tool that
can be easily deployed in-home or in residential communities. While non-brain signals characterizing biological
and behavioral traits may prove valuable, two types of brain signal also hold strong promise as digital biomarkers
of early stages of AD: epileptogenic activity (EA), and aberrant functional brain networks. Importantly, both
biomarkers can be collected affordably and reliably with the latest dry-electrode ambulatory
electroencephalography (EEG) technology. AD patients have a tenfold higher seizure prevalence compared to
the general population (Pandis and Scarmeas, 2012); however, the use of EA as an AD digital biomarker is
largely unexplored. It is also well known that amnestic MCI (aMCI) and AD patients show subtle functional
network disruptions that are promising predictors of AD, as shown by our group (e.g Pusil et al., 2019) and
others, but there is no previous research assessing the joint impact between EA and functional networks. The
scientific premise of this proposal is two-fold: (i) a combinatorial EA and functional network biomarker will predict
conversion from aMCI to AD more robustly than a single signal in isolation, and (ii) a novel deep learning model
that performs multimodal (MEG and EEG) learning to find shared signatures of AD, but ultimately yields a model
that needs affordable EEG-only data, will yield a powerful biomarker. This proposal will pursue three specific
aims. 1) Identify specific features of EA that prognosticate aMCI conversion; 2) Design a digital biomarker that
predicts aMCI conversion from EA features and functional brain networks; 3) Extend the digital biomarker to
ambulatory EEG with dry electrode technology. To achieve these aims, we will collect MEG, wet-electrode EEG,
and dry-electrode (ambulatory) EEG data from 200 aMCI patients, evaluate their signals with expert
epileptologists, and monitor the patientâs yearly conversion rate to AD. We will then design and validate a deep
learning model called Siamese Multiple Graph to Gauss (SMG2G), which performs multimodal learning on MEG
and EEG network (graph) data but ultimately yields a model that needs EEG-only data to make predictions of
aMCI conversion. The final product will be a dry-electrode ambulatory EEG digital biomarker that can be readily
measured in home or in a residential facility. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it
is the first to combine EA and functional network signals to design an AD biomarker and achieves this by cutting-
edge machine learning. It is also significant because it will advance the field vertically both scientifically and
clinically by enabling large-scale, early detection of AD. Our team is especially well-prepared to undertake this
project, with clinical and engineering expertise, strong collaboration over the years, with preliminary data
supporting the aims, and institutional support."

10795736,"Abstract
 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-dependent neurodegenerative
disease with progressive impairment in synaptic and cognitive functions occurred early in
the disease course. For past three decades, various hypotheses are proposed to
determine the cause of AD pathogenesis. The amyloid hypothesis is being tested most
extensively in the field because of strong supports from human genetic and
epidemiological studies. The main essence of hypothesis is that the abnormal level of Î²-
amyloid peptide (AÎ²) leads to sequential pathological developments that eventually cause
a potential of synaptic and cognitive dysfunctions in AD patients. Consistently, deletion or
inhibition of BACE1, which is a sole enzyme for cleaving amyloid precursor protein (APP)
at the Î²-secretase site to initiate the generation of AÎ², reduces AÎ² production and amyloid
pathology. Brain penetrable inhibitors are tested in clinical trials but fail to improve
cognitive functions in AD patients, resulting in the early termination of clinical trials. We
and others show that BACE1 regulates synaptic plasticity and clinical used BACE1
inhibitors actually impair synaptic function at a clinically tested dose. In this proposal,
we aim to find solutions that will take the advantage of this plaque reduction and can
overcome the unwanted side effects associated with worsening cognitive
functions/scores. Our goal is to develop strategy that improve synaptic functions in
association with BACE1 inhibition in AD patients. We will test our central hypothesis that
BACE1 inhibitors will be more effective for AD treatment if BACE1-mediated synaptic
impairment is under controls. Two specific aims are proposed to test our hypothesis: Aim
1 is to differentiate toxic AÎ²-mediated and BACE1-mediated synaptic impairments in
mouse models. Aim 2 is to determine whether mGluR1 positive allosteric modulator will
improve AD and BACE1-mediated synaptic impairment. The ultimate goal is to optimize
the use of BACE1 inhibitors and supplement with synaptic enhancer such as a positive
allosteric modulator (PAM) of metabotropic glutamate receptor-1 (mGluR1) in AD mice.
Our preliminary studies support shows improved long term potentiation in BACE1-null
mice treated with an mGluR1 PAM. Knowledge gained from this study will guide the
future clinical application of BACE1 in human."
10526407,"Project Summary/Abstract
Status epilepticus (SE) is a frequent neurological emergency that can reduce the quality of life of those
affected, produce cognitive deficits, and result in the development of epilepsy. Brain inflammation is an
invariable feature of seizure activity and is believed to contribute to neuronal demise and exacerbate the
deleterious behavioral consequences of unabated seizures. However, the involvement of blood-borne immune
cells in the brain's inflammatory reaction after seizures remains unresolved. We have recently identified a
subclass of circulating monocytes that invades brain tissue after seizures. Our findings indicate that blocking
monocyte infiltration, via Ccr2 knockout, reduces the deleterious consequences of SE. These results prompt us
to ask whether brain-invading monocytes are a novel therapeutic target to attenuate the adverse effects of
seizures, alleviate cognitive dysfunction, and inhibit the development of epilepsy after SE.
My hypothesis is that microglia-driven recruitment of brain-invading monocytes is a strong driver of SE-induced
neurobehavioral deficits and epileptogenesis in the weeks following SE because pro-inflammatory monocytes
migrate across the BBB promoting albumin extravasation into the brain. The lessons gleaned from completion
of the proposed studies will lead to insights into myeloid cell biology in epilepsy as well as brain disease in
general. The proposed studies will determine how the peripheral immune system can impact central immune
reactions and contribute to co-morbidities, leading to decreased quality of life in individuals afflicted with
epilepsy. Utilizing multiple techniques, my specific aims are designed to investigate and validate important
components of this hypothesis.
Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that brain-infiltrating monocytes engraft in the brain and maintain their
 own pro-inflammatory profile, exacerbating a pro-inflammatory response in microglia.
Aim 2. To test the hypothesis that albumin extravasation is reliant on monocyte migration across the
BBB.
Aim 3. To determine if blocking monocyte brain entry exerts antiepileptogenic or disease modifying
 effects after SE.
If our aims are achieved, then this would support continued efforts for targeting peripheral monocytes with
therapies, which could have a significant impact on reducing the burden of neurological disease, a major
mission of NINDS."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a highly heterogeneous multifactorial disease. Genetic influences on AD are
strong as shown by several pathogenic genes and over 50 AD loci identified through genome-wide association
studies (GWAS). There are also clear sex differences in AD risk and progression. Women are at a higher risk
of developing AD and present faster progression. A recent GTEx study also highlights sex differences in the
genetic regulation of gene expression. Despite these established sex differences, sex-specific molecular
findings in AD are still limited. The objective of this study is therefore to generate detailed sex-specific multi-
tissue molecular profiles of AD and decipher the genetic architecture that underlies AD. We propose to identify
sex-specific functional mechanisms underlying the genetic architecture of AD. We will generate multiple layers
of -omics data, including DNA methylation, gene expression, proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics, from
several large and well characterized studies. A series of well-powered sex-specific omics characterization
across multiple tissues can help identify novel drug targets and provide critical insights for clinically translatable
interventions for prevention and treatment. We will then map additional GWAS loci by performing sex-specific
multi-omic quantitative trait loci and co-localization for each -omic layers. We will identify the causal genes,
proteins, and additional -omic analytes by performing Mendelian randomization. Analyzing such omics data will
elucidate a causal path from sex-specific genetic variation to AD risk, onset and progression. The human multi-
omic data will finally be combined with induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models to identify novel sex-
specific FDA-approved therapeutics. We have assembled a very productive and interdisciplinary research
team with expertise in all the aspect of the proposal. All aims in this proposal will be conducted and reported in
compliance with NIH guidance on scientific rigor and reproducibility. Our preliminary data already identified
several genes and proteins that are associated with AD risk and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in a sex-
specific manner. All the raw data will be shared via NIA-approved mechanism (including AD Knowledge Portal,
NIAGADS). This rich resource will benefit the field for additional analyses beyond the ones proposed here."

The overall goal and singular focus of our proposed Center Without Walls is to unravel the
mechanisms of FTLD-TDP. We have formed a diverse interdisciplinary team to tackle this
challenge. Our team brings together experts in genetics, genomics, neuroscience, neurology, and
pathology. We have FTLD experts as well as outsiders who bring new perspectives and key
resources and approaches to the field. Our team has also recently made an unexpected discovery
of a new splicing target of TDP-43, which provides a direct and surprising connection to FTD
human genetics and will be a launching pad for defining the mechanisms of FTLD-TDP. We posit
that mis-splicing events caused by TDP-43 dysfunction may well be the earliest events in the
process. Our vision is to create a Center dedicated to providing unprecedented access to TDP-
43 function, even before it is depleted from the nucleus. Rather than have human genetics as an
afterthought or addendum, we endeavor to have the genetics deeply integrated in our program
from Day 1. Our Center will make all of the data and code we generate freely available via a web
portal that contains high resolution images of human brains across different subtypes of FTLD-
TDP showing, at cellular resolution, TDP-43 localization along with a panel of cryptic splicing
readouts as sensitive beacons of TDP-43 activity in different brain regions. This will empower the
broad FTLD research community to generate (and test) new hypotheses about disease
mechanisms and to have at their disposal sensitive biomarkers. Our Center will launch multimodal
efforts to 1) comprehensively discover the TDP-43 splicing targets relevant to human FTLD-TDP;
2) define the mechanisms by which TDP-43-dependent cryptic exon splicing events contribute to
neurodegeneration, using model systems and human tissues; 3) harness these novel cryptic
exons to generate highly sensitive and specific biomarkers for the FTD field; 4) innovate genomics
analysis methods to integrate human genetics data and RNA sequencing data and make these
resources available to the community to discover how genetic risk factors for FTD contribute to
cryptic exon splicing and vice versa. We strongly suspect that we will discover the cryptic exon
splicing code that serves as the Achillesâ heel to drive neurodegeneration in FTLD-TDP."

Pathological tau deposition occurs in a subset of neurodegenerative disorders including frontotemporal
lobar degeneration with tau inclusions (FTLD-tau). Much of what is known about FTLD-tau is derived
from mutant tau models or overexpression. However, a unified view of overall tau metabolismâfrom its
initial production, interactions with molecular chaperones, post-translational modifications, targeting to
lysosomes/autophagy, and resultant degradation, to our knowledge has not been generated The long-
term goal of this proposed FTD Center without Walls (CWOW) is to improve our understanding of the
pathobiological mechanisms underlying FTD-tau. Its overall objective is to elucidate the genes,
molecules and pathways that regulate tau metabolism and to determine the impact of disease-
associated mutations and variants. Our central hypothesis is that proper tau metabolism requires the
precise, coordinated action of molecular chaperones, co-chaperones, PTMs and degradation
machinery that each represent regulatory nodes. Genetic mutations in tau and other pathway members
can disrupt tau metabolism, leading to tau accumulation, secretion and neurodegeneration. The Center
will be led by Dr. Aimee Kao, who will also lead Core A: Administration and Data Core (with Co-lead Dr.
Yokoyama) and Project 1: Tau Molecular Chaperones, targeting and proteolysis (with Co-I Dr. Agard).
Dr. David Agard will oversee Core B: Macromolecular and Cellular Structure Core. Dr. Jennifer
Yokoyama will lead Core C: Genomics and Transcriptomics. Finally, Dr. Celeste Karch will lead Project
2: Tau Half Life and Secretion. We will achieve these objectives through four Specific Aims. Aim 1:
Understand the normal process of tau metabolism as a series of decisions that are made at regulatory
nodes. Aim 2: Identify and test the functional relevance of genetic variants in MAPT and other tau
metabolism genes, in in vitro, cell and iNeuron models, on each of the tau metabolism regulatory
nodes. Aim 3: Integrate findings from Projects and Cores to produce a Tau Metabolism and Variant
Database (TMVdb), that will serve as a reference point for the field. Aim 4: Integrate findings from
Projects and Cores to produce a Tau Polygenic Risk Score (TPRS), which will stratify genetic risk for
tauopathy. Upon successful completion of these Aims, the proposed FTD CWOW will have provided
fundamental information about tau metabolism, defined mechanistic nodes predisposing to tauopathy

Animals constantly make decisions, such as how to evaluate a potential threat or where to look for food. Yet the
same animal in the same environment can produce different decisions on different occasions, because its
internal state interacts powerfully with external inputs to determine behavior. This proposalâs overarching goal
is to understand how internal states influence decisions and to identify the underlying neural mechanisms. In a
mouse decision-making task, these experiments will examine the effects of three types of internal state changes:
those arising spontaneously with engagement and disengagement in a task, those resulting from changing
expectations during the task, and those resulting from learning within and across days. To determine how internal
states affect brain activity and behavior, the team will apply cutting-edge technical advances on a brainwide
scale, including statistical tools to infer internal states from behavior; simultaneous recordings from large
populations of neurons across many regions during behavior and during optogenetic perturbations; assays that
map functionally and molecularly defined cell-type-specific, cross-region connectivity; and computational
approaches to model how cross-region neural communication depends on internal states.
These ambitious goals go beyond the capabilities of an individual laboratory and are ideally suited for an already-
productive consortium. This team is part of the International Brain Laboratory, which has already developed a
standardized mouse decision-making task and standardized methods for training, neural measurement, and data
analysis, along with a working, scalable infrastructure for sharing data. The proposed research leverages this
existing infrastructure and takes it in a new direction. Projects 1-5 will examine simultaneously recorded
population activity, evaluate causality, study neural activity and behavior during learning in normal and autism
model mice, identify cell types by measuring neuronal activity, gene expression, and axonal projection patterns
in the same populations of neurons, and build a comprehensive computational model of all these experimental
results. Cores A-D will support the collection, replicability, management, and analysis of the large datasets
produced by this brainwide examination of neural circuits.
Taken together, the proposed research will rigorously define the neural basis of multiple internal states and
evaluate their impact on the flow of decision-relevant information through the brain. The results will greatly
advance the field by generating a comprehensive, mechanistic understanding of how internal states are reflected
in the brain, and how these states interact with external inputs to guide decisions. Moreover, the team will
produce and disseminate open-source tools and protocols that will enable other laboratories to collect and
manage large-scale datasets produced through brainwide measurements."

10895371,"This proposal is to develop the University of Pennsylvaniaâs Innovation in Suicide Prevention Implementation
Research (INSPIRE) Center. Suicide is a leading cause of death in the US that disproportionately affects
minority and disenfranchised populations, including Blacks, Hispanics and sexual/gender minorities. Yet, these
groups often are not included in suicide prevention research. Guided by a conceptual model based on the
Integrated Behavior Model, which posits that organizational culture, policies, and resources (or lack thereof)
impact the providerâs attributes and behaviors, INSPIRE brings together psychology, implementation science,
health economics, machine learning, health information technology, psychiatry and participatory research
experts to apply innovative interdisciplinary approaches to suicide prevention. INSPIREâs overarching goals are
to develop and adapt practice-based and other suicide prevention interventions for underserved groups and to
design and test implementation strategies to optimize how evidence-based practices can be brought to scale
efficiently and with high fidelity, for optimal effectiveness. INSPIRE will prioritize strategies that can be rapidly
deployed in a range of practice settings, including those with limited resources, thereby increasing their reach
and public health impact. Penn INSPIRE will use state-of-the-science methods from participatory research to
actively engage stakeholders from many sectors â including patients, providers, and payers â at every level of
its work to accomplish its Specific Aims. INSPIRE will apply innovative, interdisciplinary behavior change and
implementation science methods to develop, adapt, and evaluate cost effective interventions. A Signature
Project will use a stepped wedge study design to test an innovative organizational strategy that leverages
telehealth to deliver high quality Safety Planning Intervention and follow-up services in Emergency Departments.
Three Exploratory Projects will test novel strategies for suicide prevention across individual, clinician, and
organizational levels and with specific vulnerable populations that will lay the foundation for more definitive
studies. INSPIRE will also support 10 pilot projects and an innovative Methods Core that will develop and test
new methods to advance research at the intersection of suicide prevention and implementation science. The
Suicide Prevention Scholars Program will expand the cadre of suicide prevention researchers by engaging both
emerging investigators and established scientists who do not currently work on suicide prevention â particularly
those from groups under-represented in research â through content, design. and methodological mentoring and
capacity-building. By catalyzing interdisciplinary, cross-sector collaborations and advancing suicide prevention
research, care, and policy both locally and nationally, we will develop cost-effective, practical, and efficient ways
to implement evidence-based suicide prevention interventions. INSPIRE is poised to be transformational for
suicide prevention."
10891757,"A higher epigenetic age relative to chronological age, described as âepigenetic age acceleration (EAA),â indicates
that an individual is biologically older than their years. The investigative team recently showed that EAA is
associated with lower cognitive function (e.g., episodic memory, phonemic fluency) and lower white matter and
total brain volumes, supporting a role of EAA in cognitive and brain health. Yet, while age is the strongest risk
factor for Alzheimerâs disease and related dementias (ADRD), the association of EAA with mild cognitive
impairment (MCI), ADRD, and brain aging is vastly understudied. The NIAâs 2020-2025 Strategic Directions for
Research goals include understanding how âmolecular bases of changes associated with aging contribute to the
development and course of age-related dementiaâ and identifying âbiological and clinical markers for early
detection of cognitive decline, MCI, and AD.â Towards these goals, the overall objective of this project is to clarify
the association of EAA with MCI, ADRD, successful cognitive aging, and brain aging in a nested case-cohort
(N=2,836) within the deeply phenotyped, racially and ethnically diverse, NIA-funded Womenâs Health Initiative
Memory Study (WHIMS). With 25 years of follow-up that will continue at least through 2021, WHIMS contains
detailed data on longitudinal measures of cognitive function; 1,336 incident cases of rigorously ascertained MCI
and ADRD; genome-wide genotyping; and longitudinal neuroimaging measures of brain health. As an innovative
aspect of this study, novel genome-wide DNA methylation data using stored blood DNA from two study visits 14-
18 years apart will be generated to examine changes in EAA. The Aims are to: 1) determine the extent to which
EAA is associated with higher risk of MCI and ADRD and lower likelihood of survival to age 90 without cognitive
impairment; 2) determine the extent to which EAA is associated with decreased total and regional brain volumes
and increased total ventricular and white matter lesion volumes; and 3) identify epigenetic signatures across the
genome associated with these cognitive and brain outcomes in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS).
Moderation of associations by race/ethnicity, APOE Îµ4 carriage, polygenic risk for AD, and cardiovascular
disease will be explored. Findings will be replicated and extended in well-phenotyped, independent cohorts of
men and women with data on genome-wide DNA methylation and cognitive and brain outcomes. Given that the
pathophysiological ADRD process can begin up to 20 years before symptom onset, understanding the role of
EAA as an aging biomarker identifying older adults early in the disease course is imperative to potentially prevent
irreversible cognitive and functional decline. This study also presents a unique opportunity to identify age-
associated epigenetic mechanisms of MCI, ADRD, and accelerated brain aging with potential to act as
therapeutic targets to promote preserved cognition in late life. Importantly, the novel genome-wide DNA
methylation data will enrich the existing WHIMS data resource and enable future examination of EAA and EWAS
in relation to diverse phenotypes of aging, thereby having a broad and lasting scientific impact beyond this study."

The overall aims of the Zambia Alabama HIV Alcohol Comorbidities Program (ZAMBAMA) are to (Aim 1) test
the effectiveness of a transdiagnostic model, Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA), to reduce
unhealthy alcohol use and improve HIV clinical outcomes in under-resourced HIV clinics, (Aim 2) evaluate the
mechanisms through which CETA impacts HIV outcomes, (Aim 3) investigate whether the treatment effect of
CETA varies by clinical (e.g., presence of comorbidities), demographic (e.g., gender) and/or contextual factors
(e.g., Zambia, Alabama), and (Aim 4) examine implementation factors, including cost, related to integrated
delivery of alcohol reduction interventions to disadvantaged people with HIV and unhealthy alcohol use at front-
line HIV clinics. The P01âs central theme is that, among people with HIV and unhealthy alcohol use, integrated
screening and treatment of common behavioral and mental health comorbidities will lower unhealthy alcohol use
and improve HIV treatment outcomes. ZAMBAMA will be implemented by a collaborative team that brings
together groups of established and young investigators working to address scientific gaps at the nexus of HIV,
substance use, and mental illness in priority geographical areas in the global HIV response: sub-Saharan Africa
and the Southern U.S. Together, the team will implement two randomized controlled clinical trials in adults with
HIV and unhealthy alcohol use to evaluate CETAâs effects on alcohol use, the HIV care continuum (antiretroviral
therapy adherence, engagement and retention in HIV care, viral suppression), and common mental health and
substance use comorbidities. Project 1 (CETA HIV Alcohol Reduction Trial in Zambia - CHARTZ) will be
implemented at public sector primary HIV clinics in Zambia where existing HIV âpeer educatorsâ (i.e., lay
counselors) will be trained to provide an alcohol brief intervention (BI) and CETA to participants at in-person
sessions. Project 2 (Telemedicine for Unhealthy Alcohol Use in Persons Living with HIV using CETA - TALC)
will enroll participants receiving HIV care at community Ryan White HIV/AIDS program-funded clinics across
Alabama that serve diverse and rural populations. Graduate-level providers (supervised by a licensed clinical
psychologist) will provide the interventions (BI and CETA) remotely using telemedicine approaches that were
rapidly expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both research projects will also evaluate implementation
factors, to enhance the impact of clinical effectiveness data, and both projects will be supported by 3 resource
cores: a CETA core for clinical intervention training and oversight, a Methods and Analysis core to harmonize
data elements across projects and create synergy in data analyses, and an Administrative core to manage
business and regulatory requirements of the P01, monitor and manage overall progress, and promote
bidirectional knowledge and idea exchange between Southern U.S.- and sub-Saharan Africa-focused
investigators."

âWhat is the function of glial cells in neural centers? The answer is still not known, and it may remain unsolved
for many years to come until scientists find direct methods to attack it.â (Ramon y Cajal, 1901). This prophecy
turned out to be accurate. Astrocytes, one of the most abundant cell types in the brain, have long been thought
of as primarily passive support cells. Over the past two decades, studies indicate that astrocytes play pivotal
roles in nervous system development, function, and diseases. However, a major unresolved issue in
neuroscience is how astrocytes integrate diverse neuronal signals under healthy conditions, modulate neural
circuit structure and function at multiple temporal and spatial scales, and how aberrant excitation and molecular
output influences sensorimotor behavior and contributes to disease. The overall goal of this U19 Team-Research
BRAIN Circuit Program proposal is to address this fundamental issue by developing a deeper mechanistic
understanding of astrocytesâ roles in neural circuit operation, complex behaviors, and brain computation
theories. Two overarching questions will be addressed: 1) How do astrocytes temporally and spatially integrate
molecular signals from the diverse types of local and projection neurons activated during sensorimotor behaviors.
2) How do astrocytes convert this information into functional outputs that modulate neural circuit structure and
function at different spatial and temporal scales. A multidisciplinary, comprehensive effort is proposed to address
these questions that can only be completed through close collaboration between researchers with unique and
complementary expertise. An innovative multi-scale approach integrating functional, anatomical, and genetic
analyses with theoretical modeling will be leveraged. This approach involves quantitative behavioral assays,
large-scale imaging of cellular and molecular dynamics, targeted cell-type-specific manipulations, high-
throughput omic techniques, genetic profiling, protein engineering, machine learning, and computational
modeling. By integrating experimental and theoretical approaches, molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms
will be determined through which astrocytes influence neural circuits and contribute to complex behaviors and
brain computation theories. The experimental and data analysis tools developed as part of this project will be
invaluable for the broader neuroscience community."

 Overall Component: Abstract
California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) is an institution serving underserved populations and
underrepresented students (ISUPS), and the University of California, Irvine Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer
Center (UCI-CFCCC) is an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center. Together, we plan to establish a
collaborative partnership to develop pilot research projects between faculty members at CSUF and UCI-CFCCC
that will generate preliminary data for R01 or other competitively funded grant applications, and educate
undergraduates (at CSUF) and master's students (at CSUF and UCI) in cancer health disparities research. The
Partnership plans to fund five pilot projects, and educate a total of 38 students during the length of the proposed
grant period. The overall specific aims of this new cancer-specific partnership are to: plan, implement and
evaluate a highly integrated and interactive cancer health disparities partnership between CSUF and UCI-
CFCCC; conduct pilot cancer health disparities research projects involving at least one investigator at each
institution that advance knowledge regarding cancer health disparities, leading to the submission of competitive
grant applications by NIH/NCI and other federal/non-federal agencies; and provide cancer research education
to underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students to increase their understanding of cancer health
disparities, leading to a larger pool of highly talented future scientists from diverse backgrounds.
To accomplish this we will undertake a set of activities organized under four components. The Administrative
Core will be responsible for the overall administrative and fiscal aspects of all P20 activities, and will include the
Executive Committee and Internal Advisory Committee. Activities will be implemented in three stages: initial
planning, implementation, and evaluation. The evaluation effort will be spearheaded by an external evaluator
with expertise in multi-component center reviews. The two pilot research projects each focus on a cancer health
disparity: the first is a basic science study that will conduct lipidomic profiling, and DNA and RNA sequencing of
tumor/NAT paired samples to optimize sample preparation and detect genetic/genomic and transcriptomic
differences that are related to African American triple negative breast cancer risk. The second is an
epidemiological study that will examine Asian sub-ethnic group differences in ovarian cancer mortality and
treatment patterns. The long term goals of this collaborative partnership are to diversity the cancer research
workforce and ultimately increase our scientific impact to address the cancer health disparity needs in Orange
County, California."
10892336,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer`s disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative disease of the brain, a dementing illness associated
with early neurovascular changes and the accumulation of misfolded amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) and tau in the brain. At
present, no effective treatment is available to slow or halt the progression of AD. Hence, uncovering novel
mechanisms that govern AD pathogenesis may advance the development of more effective therapeutic
strategies to treat this devastating disease. Mounting evidence suggests that the accumulation and aggregation
of Ab in brain parenchyma and cerebral blood vessels (CBVs) is a key event leading to other AD-related
pathologies. Kinetic studies in patients with sporadic AD indicate that faulty AÎ² clearance, rather than AÎ²
overproduction, is critical for accumulation and aggregation of AÎ² in brain. However, the molecular
underpinnings of such AÎ² accumulation remain poorly understood. Our preliminary studies indicate that heparan
sulfate (HS), a type of sulfated polysaccharide that critically mediates cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction and
signaling, is strongly reduced in CBVs of AD patients. In this application, we will test our novel hypothesis that
HS expressed in CBVs normally facilitates the clearance of Ab out of the brain and that such function is disrupted
in AD, leading to impaired Ab clearance. Mechanistically, we hypothesize that HS maintains CBV integrity,
functions as a co-receptor in LRP1-mediated Ab clearance and facilitates perivascular Ab elimination. We will
pursue the following 3 specific aims to rigorously test our hypothesis: 1. Elucidate the roles of brain endothelial
cell (bEC) HS in Ab clearance and test the hypothesis that increasing bEC-HS expression normalizes Ab
clearance to mitigate AD pathogenesis. 2. Delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying the roles of bEC-HS
in brain Ab clearance and AD pathogenesis. 3. Elucidate the roles of brain vascular smooth muscle cell (bVSMC)-
HS in brain Ab clearance and AD pathogenesis. These proposed studies exploit both novel and established
genetic, cellular, scRNA-seq and biochemical approaches in conjunction with human AD specimen and AD
mouse models. The results of this study are expected to illuminate HS expressed in CBVs serves as a key
molecule to mediate brain Ab clearance and decreased CVS-HS expression exacerbates AD, and will provide
in vivo evidence for the proof of principle that increasing bEC-HS is an effective intervention to mitigate AD
pathogenesis."

 We seek to understand the nature of the pial neurovascular circuit, whose dynamics is characterized by
ultralow frequency oscillations near 0.1 Hz that parcellate into separate coherent regions across cortex. We will
use this knowledge to form a mathematical relation between the hemodynamic patterns observed in optical
and functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments and the underlying brain state.
 Our proposed studies propose to leverage our experimental expertise in in vivo optical microscopy in
mouse and fMRI in mouse and human. These primary modalities for data acquisition are combined with
behavioral training, electrophysiology, and data analysis. Our experimental effort is parallel by two theoretical
efforts. One mixed analytical/computational effort is on coupled oscillator dynamics to formulate models, at
varying levels of complexity, of the pial neurovascular circuit. A second solely computational effort concerns
the modulation of the transport of oxygen, by regional oscillations of the pial neurovascular circuit.
 The pial neurovascular circuit is composed of a two-dimensional network of pial arterioles that undergo
rhythmic oscillations in the ~ 0.1 Hz vasomotor band. Each element in this circuit - a segment of arteriole
whose diameter is modulated by the constriction/dilation of smooth muscle, contains an intrinsic rhythm
generator, much like intrinsic bursting neurons in central pattern generators. The pial arterioles integrate
neuronal activity from neighboring arterioles, underlying neurons, subcortical neurons, and neuromodulatory
centers to produce dynamic patterns of coherent oscillations in arteriolar diameter across the cortical mantle.
These patterns contain regions that oscillate at slightly different frequencies, i.e., they parcellate into separate
regions. The fascinating issue is that the parcellation only partially reflects input from the directly underlying
neuronal input. We seek to understand, model, and exploit this parcellation.
 The PIs have collaborated on issues in neuroscience and neurovascular science for many years. This
proposal is a result of their discoveries and converging interest in a structured collaborative effort. Project 1 will
formulate an understanding of fundamental physiology of the pial neurovascular circuit. This includes
determining if brain arterioles truly act as interacting non-linear oscillators, i.e., that they entrain and phase-lock
rather than passively filter. Projects 1, 2, and 4 will explore experimentally and theoretically how four
competitive interactions, viz, input from neighboring arterioles, (ii) input from underlying neurons, (iii) input from
subcortical areas involved in homeostasis; and (iv) input from brain neuromodulatory centers, lead to the
observed patterns of pial neurovascular activity. Projects 2 and 4 will explore and model the regulation of
oxygen in subsurface vessels, while Project 3 will expand the resolution of MR imaging in humans to observe
single vessels CBV changes and thus measure pial neurovascular dynamics with unparalleled resolution. A
particular interest is to transform spatiotemporal patterns of vasomotion into predictions of internal brain state."
10807985,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Atherosclerosis, a progressive chronic inflammatory disease of the vessel wall, is regulated by oxidant stress
throughout the course of disease development. Endothelial dysfunction is a critical, initiating step in the
development of atherosclerosis and increasing evidence implicates mitochondrial reactive oxygen species
(ROS) as an important contributor to endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation. Nicotinamide nucleotide
transhydrogenase (NNT) is emerging as an important enzyme in the regulation of mitochondrial NADPH levels
which can have a significant impact on a number of metabolic pathways through the regulation of mitochondrial
redox balance. Preliminary data from our laboratory supports this concept demonstrating that NNT expression
is reduced in the endothelium of atherosclerotic patients when compared to healthy controls. These data are
consistent with previously published data from our laboratory indicating that AAV8-PCSK9 and high fat diet
treatment led to increased plaque burden in C57Bl/6J mice that lack NNT. Recent studies utilizing small hairpin
RNA knockdown of NNT in human aortic endothelial demonstrates increased hydrogen peroxide production that
is associated with reductions in mitochondrial NADPH and impairment of downstream antioxidant enzymes
glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase. Furthermore, the loss of NNT in these cells also led to
increased adhesion molecule expression and inflammatory cell trafficking suggesting that NNTâs role in
regulating mitochondrial balance can play a critical role in modulating atherosclerotic plaque development. We
have confirmed these observations in vivo using a novel endothelial specific knockout mouse where the loss of
NNT promotes enhanced adhesion molecule expression in the aortic arch of mice subjected to AAV8-PCSK9,
partial carotid ligation, and high fat diet in a model of disturbed flow induced plaque development. Building upon
these findings, we propose that the loss of NNT activity contributes to a pro-oxidative mitochondrial
phenotype that exacerbates the progression of atheroscelrosis by enhancing mitochondrial ROS
production, endothelial dysfunction, and vascular inflammation . To test this hypothesis, studies are
proposed that will determine i) if NNT inhibits mitochondrial ROS production and preserves mitochondrial
antioxidant activity and oxidative metabolisim in human vascular endothelial cells; ii) if reduced NNT expression
and increased mitochondrial ROS production stimulates Nox activity that contributes to reduced NO bioavailibilty
and promotes endothelial activation; and iii) if endothelial NNT critically regulates mitochondrial redox balance
and vascular function in mice treated with high fat diet. Data from the proposed studies will identify NNT as a
master regulator of mitochondrial function and ROS production whose absence exacerbates the development of
atherosclerosis by promoting endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation, leading to increased plaque
development."

 Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly in the United States and occurs in all
ethnic and racial groups. Although >20 susceptibility loci have been associated with AD, much of the genetic
influence on AD remains unknown. This is particularly true for diverse ethnic populations such as Hispanics (HI)
and African Americans (AA) that are underrepresented in most genetic studies compared to non-Hispanic Whites
(NHW). Though emerging studies have begun to unravel some of the ancestry associated genetic risk of AD,
understanding the role of DNA variation is only one critical step in understanding the complex underlying biology
variants do not always provide direct information on the genes and mechanisms influenced.
 To expand the context of ongoing large-scale genomic genotyping and whole genome sequencing efforts to
individuals of diverse ancestries, here we propose a transcriptomic, epigenomic, and genomic association study
of NHW, AA, and HI from Puerto Rico (PR) and Peru (PER) addressing diverse admixed populations. Completion
of this project will provide powerful functional genomic resources that could be applied to large existing and
emerging AD datasets to better understand the biological impact of genetic variation on AD risk. Specifically, we
will 1) generate whole-blood RNAseq, single-cell RNAseq, and DNA methylation datasets on existing collections
of NHW, AA, PR, and PER AD cases and elderly cognitively normal controls; 2) identify transcriptomic and
methylation differences including gene expression, alternative splicing, allele specific expression, and site and
regional methylation differences between NHW, AA, and HI cases and controls that may drive disease risk
differences between the ancestries; 3) combine these data with available DNA genotyping/whole genome
sequencing data to identify population and disease-specific expression/methylation QTLs; 4) generate the first
multiethnic imputation panel of expression/methylation QTL effects for estimating gene expression traits in
diverse (NWH, AA, HI) AD datasets; and 5) apply these panels to a broader set of thousands of multi-ethnic
genotyped samples.
 The multi-omics approach outlined here will provide much needed functional context to the ongoing DNA
variant discovery efforts in these populations while addressing the important problem of disparities in AD
research. These studies will broaden the spectrum of AD risk to gene expression and methylation and expand
existing genomic efforts to a broader AD community."

 This is a renewal application for the Rutgers University CounterACT Research Center of Excellence,
leaders in the discovery and development of drugs to treat poisoning from exposure to chemical threat agents.
The Center focuses on vesicants including sulfur mustard, nitrogen mustard, and other mechanistically related
chemicals and is organized into three Research and Development Projects, each focused on a major vesicant
target: the skin, the cornea and the lung. The overall goal of the Center is to identify specific targets in these
tissues that can be used for therapeutic intervention. To accomplish this goal, mechanistic research using
appropriate translational models for the skin, cornea and lung is being performed by scientific experts in each
of these areas. The Research and Development Projects are supported by a Pharmacology and Drug
Development Scientific Support Core and a Pharmaceutics and Medicinal Chemistry Scientific Support Core,
each consisting of investigators with considerable expertise in drug discovery, delivery and development.
Through mechanistic research, the Rutgers Center has 1) discovered and prioritized several efficacious lead
compounds and 2) developed innovative formulations and delivery systems that augment pharmacological
activity and improve pharmacokinetic profiles. Three lead compounds, two for mustard-induced ocular injury
and another for mustard-induced lung injury, are FDA approved for other indications, and are being advanced
for use as mustard countermeasures. Furthermore, IND-enabling studies have been completed on a lead
compound discovered to be effective against mustard-induced skin injury. The Rutgers CounterACT Center
has established strategic corporate partnerships for advanced drug development with lead compounds and
support by BARDA. A Research Education Core directed at students, postdoctoral trainees, technical staff, and
new and established investigators has been highly successful at training a skilled workforce in
countermeasures. During the next grant period, we will 1) identify and develop second generation drug
products with improved effectiveness, 2) disseminate key findings about mechanisms of toxicity and novel
testing strategies and models, 3) advance current drug leads through the FDA approval process and 4) expand
training and workforce development opportunities. By meeting key research, development, and training
milestones, the Center is well-poised to advance new and repurposed drugs through the approval process for
treating vesicant poisoning in humans."

Alzheimerâs disease (AD) is a major health concern defined by pathologic changes in the brain that produce
altered behavior and cognitive function. There is a need for primate models of AD because they naturally
recapitulate some neuropathological features of AD with advanced age whereas other model organisms (i.e.,
rodents) do not. For instance, while amyloid-beta (AÎ²) deposition occurs in a few mammals, tau-positive
neurofibrillary tangles have only been identified in a very limited nonhuman species studied to date.
Additionally, elderly nonhuman primates, develop cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), a neurovascular
condition found in almost 100% of AD patients and associated with cognitive decline. Here, we are proposing
to further develop squirrel monkeys as a model species for current and future studies on the biology of aging
and AD research. In the R21 component, we propose to train a cohort of group living squirrel monkeys on the
use of an automated cognitive testing system (ACTS) that is designed to assess a variety of cognitive functions
including learning, memory and executive control. Creating large cohorts of squirrel monkeys trained on the
ACTS system will provide animals with established cognitive phenotypes for use in preclinical studies and
allow for examining of their association with potential age-related differences in neuroanatomical,
neuropathological and biomarker data. In the R33 component of the proposed studies, we will test for
associations between age-related changes in cognition and measures of blood/CSF biomarkers, neural
organization and integrity and neuropathology. Additionally, we will test for the effect of ACTS training on
aged related changes in neuroanatomy, neuropathology and AD-related biomarkers. Specifically, during Years
3 to 5, we will obtain magnetic resonance images (MRI) and biological samples from 40 elderly and geriatric
monkeys trained on the ACTS system. With this cohort, 20 monkeys will receive continued cognitive training
(ACTS+) during year 3 to 5 while the remaining 20 individuals will not receive training on any new cognition
asks (ACTS-). In a subset of ACTS+ and ACTS- monkeys, we will obtain postmortem measures of
neuropathology. In one set of analyses within the ACTS cohort, we will test for longitudinal changes in
cognition and their association with variation in (1) neural organization and integrity quantified form MRI
scans and (2) several key biomarkers of AD-related neuropathology. Additionally, to examine whether
cognitive stimulation slows down the normal brain aging process, we will compare age-related changes in
cognition and the brain between the ACTS+ and ACTS- monkeys. The proposed studies, in their entirety, will
fill an important gap in our knowledge about the comparative biology of aging and disease in squirrel monkeys
and provide critical translational insight into how those processes contribute to the progression of CAA and AD
in humans. This information will provide crucial direction for future AD therapeutic trials using nonhuman

 Arboviruses remain an immense public health threat, causing yearly large epidemics. The overarching aim
of this research is to better understand the role of the Aedes aegypti RNA interference (RNAi) pathway in
antiviral defense and innate immunity, and to generate knowledge and tools for the development of new
methods to control arbovirus transmission. Population replacement of wild-type with genetically modified
mosquitoes incapable of pathogen transmission is emerging as a promising complement to other disease
control methods. Because Ae. aegypti transmits multiple arbovirus pathogens that are frequently sympatric, it
is important for a transgenic mosquito to be resistant to multiple pathogens. The siRNA pathway-mediated
antiviral defense system is known to act against a broad range of viruses. However, despite the RNAi
pathway's emergence as the major pan-antiviral defense system it remains understudied in mosquitoes. Our
research plan is designed to test the overarching hypothesis that the A. aegypti proteins, Dicer-2 (Dcr-2), R2D2
and Argonaute-2 (Ago-2), are key components mediating an RNA silencing response that is broadly protective
against arbovirus infections. We will use of siRNA-deficient loss-of-function mutants and transgenic
mosquitoes over-expressing Dcr-2, Ago-2 and R2D2 that will be generated in Aim 1. With these genetic tools
we will clarify the temporal and spatial specificity of the antiviral response in Aim 2, and investigate possible
inter-tissue signaling and regulation of vertical transmission in Aim 3. In Aim 4 we will address interactions
between the RNAi pathway and other innate immunity defense systems. This project utilizes the
complementary expertise of Drs Dimopoulos and Myles with the arbovirus infection systems, mosquito
transgenesis, mosquito innate immunity and RNAi/small RNA biology. Our proposed project will also generate
powerful tools for studying other aspects of the RNAi pathway in Ae. aegypti biology."
10734033,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Type I diabetes is a chronic autoimmune that affects 3 million children and adults in the US with healthcare
costs exceeding $14.9 billion annually. Currently, there is no cure for type 1 diabetes, representing a critical
unmet medical need. Transplantation of allogeneic islets is a reliable method of achieving durable glucose
homeostasis and preventing the devastating complications of type 1 diabetes. However, there are four major
barriers to allogeneic islet transplantation; i) ineffective engraftment, ii) rejection, iii) adverse effects of
immunosuppression used to control rejection, and iv) shortage of cadaveric donor islets. Therefore, there is a
significant need for strategies that overcome these limitations of islet transplantation for a broader clinical practice.
This R01 application aims to develop an innovative and highly translational immunomodulatory protocol to
overcome the limitations of islet transplantation for sustained long-term graft survival in the absence of
chronic use of immunosuppression.
 Infusion of islets into the liver via portal vein, the only route of transplantation in clinical use, instantly
exposes the graft to blood and initiates an immediate blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR). IBMIR is
mediated by thrombotic and inflammatory reactions and is responsible for the destruction of 50-80% islets
immediate post-transplantation. The remaining islets are then subject to rejection by the slower, but potent
adaptive immune responses. Significant early islet loss requires transplantation from 2-3 donors per
recipients, which further contribute to the shortage of cadaveric donors. The goal of this proposal is to
develop powerful, yet focused therapies to simultaneously target the immediate inflammatory
reactions and adaptive immune response to prevent early and late graft loss. This will be accomplished
by generating novel recombinant proteins with robust inhibitory functions on prothrombotic, proinflammatory,
and adaptive immune reactions. These proteins will be engineered on pancreatic islets before transplantation
for localized modulation of thrombotic and inflammatory responses to enhance engraftment and achieve
indefinite graft survival without the chronic use of debilitating immunosuppression that is currently standard.
This concept will be tested in three different allogeneic islet transplantation settings for efficacy and
mechanisms; chemically diabetic BALB/c-to-C57BL/6 mice, spontaneously diabetic C57BL/6-to-NOD mice,
and human islets into humanized mice. These models will generate critical data relevant to the human setting.
Furthermore, proof-of-efficacy and the elucidation of the immune mechanisms regulating effective outcomes
will expedite further refinement of this immunomodulatory concept and its eventual translation to nonhuman
primates as a prelude to clinical trials for the treatment of type 1 diabetes."

This is an application for the continuation of the Washington University Center for Diabetes Translation
Research (WU-CDTR). The Center is guided by our strategic vision in which a health equity lens is the
foundation for transformative diabetes research translated into action and impact. This equity-driven vision
informs our Center mission to be the nexus for transdisciplinary team science in advancing the conduct of the
next generation of diabetes translation research. Our goal is to advance a rigorous, scientific evidence base to
inform the dissemination, implementation, and sustainability of efficacious interventions for populations at risk
for diabetes disparities. The WU-CDTR is the intellectual home to an outstanding network of investigators who
conduct research on the root causes of diabetes inequities, informed by social determinants of health and
organized around five thematic areas: biobehavioral discovery; living and working conditions; health care
context; health information and technology environment; and community, policy and systems research. The
research base consists of 87 investigators (66 Full Members and 21 Associate Members) from within
Washington University, and 21 different universities with members affiliated through our Regional and National
Resource Cores (Department of Health Management and Informatics at the University of Missouri in Columbia;
and the Council on Black Health at Drexel University in Pennsylvania, respectively). Our research base is
defined by established (69%) and new diabetes investigators (31%), as well as those from underrepresented
minority populations (38%); members work in collaboration with a network of multi-sectoral partners (N=73)
including healthcare and non-health care organizations. From 2016 to present, WU-CDTR investigators were
awarded $243.2 million in total direct costs and $66.8 million in annual direct costs. This includes 86 current
and ongoing Center supported grants generating $173.3 million in total direct costs and $40.7 million in annual
direct costs; 65% of WU-CDTR Full Members have NIH funding, and 80% of total grant support is from federal
sources. The WU-CDTR is organized around five novel Translational Research Cores, led by national experts
in their respective fields. They include cores on: Dissemination and Implementation in Diabetes Research;
Policy and Systems Science Analysis; Health Communication and Social Needs; Health Informatics in
Diabetes Research (Regional Resource); and Solutions to Diabetes in Black Americans (National Resource).
We also sponsor a very successful Pilot and Feasibility Program focused on early stage and under-
represented minority investigators and a vibrant Enrichment Program, which enhances education and
awareness of diabetes translation research. The WU-CDTR enhances efficiency, productivity, and rapid
research translation across a national network of investigators while fostering collaborations to achieve

10795730,"Each year, millions of Americans are exposed to repetitive head impacts (RHI) through contact sport participation
and may be at risk for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The clinical presentation of CTE is ill-defined
and includes deficits in executive function and memory, dementia, neurobehavioral dysregulation and
depression. While these clinical features have been attributed to phosphorylated tau (p-tau) pathology, our data
show p-tau is not related to neuropsychiatric symptoms and does not account for all cognitive deficits in CTE.
The etiology of these clinical features is thus unclear and likely multifactorial. Our data in small samples of male
football players show that white matter (WM) degeneration and cerebrovascular disease (CBVD) are common
and affect cognition. Yet, the vascular contributions to neuropsychiatric syndromes and cognitive impairment
and dementia (VCID) in former contact sport athletes are unknown and a topic that our existing studies do not
address. This R01 will conduct sophisticated in vivo and ex vivo assessments of WM integrity and CBVD and
examine risk factors for, and the cognitive and neuropsychiatric effects of WM degeneration and CBVD in living
and deceased former contact sport athletes. In a collaborative effort between the Boston University (BU) and
Univ. of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs), we will recruit 200
former contact sport athletes (>50 years), males and females from different sports, and 100 age- and race-
matched people with no history of RHI or traumatic brain injury (TBI). Groups will span the cognitive continuum.
Participants will enroll into the BU or UCSF ADRC to complete cognitive and neuropsychiatric tests, advanced
MRI protocols of WM integrity and CBVD, and blood draw for plasma biomarker analysis of WM integrity and
CBVD. A subgroup (50 former contact sport athletes, 25 non-RHI/TBI) will undergo lumbar puncture to test
plasma-CSF analyte concordance and examine novel CSF microvascular markers. We will expand our U54 of
7 harmonized brain banks studying RHI and AD/ADRD risk by adding novel ELISA, multiplex
immunofluorescence, and CLARITY pathological assessments of WM integrity (myelin integrity and thickness,
oligodendrocyte and axonal loss) and CBVD (vessel density, size, and branch points) on 200 deceased contact
sport athletes (varying in RHI exposure and age) and 100 age-/race-matched non-RHI/TBI donors. Harmonized
pathological protocols, informant interviews and clinicopathological conferences are done across all brain banks.
Data from this R01 will be used to test our hypotheses that RHI exposure is associated with WM degeneration
and CBVD; these pathologies independently contribute to executive dysfunction, neurobehavioral dysregulation
and depression; and RHI (e.g., type of sport played) and non-RHI (e.g., vascular risk) factors are effect modifiers.
This R01 will lead to unprecedented data sets to increase understanding of the risk for cognitive and
neuropsychiatric impairment from WM degeneration and CBVD in former contact sport athletes. Data will inform
on symptom etiology and open the door to intervention and preventative targets for the millions exposed to RHI."

The Great Plains is a vast, rural region with pockets of urban development. Geographic and social isolationâ
combined with lack of access to primary and specialized care in both rural and underserved urban areasâ
characterize some of our most vulnerable populations. The GP IDeA-CTR network was established in 2016 to
address these pressing needs. Headquartered at UNMC with partner institutions across Nebraska and the
Dakotas, we built a robust, networked research infrastructure to develop and guide our CTR investigators,
promote resource sharing, and advance collaborations among CTR investigators and community members.
We leveraged relationships with national CTRs, CTSAs, and other national organizations to share best
practices and strategies for developing CTR. These accomplishments advanced a network culture of team
science and strengthened our ability to compete successfully for research awards and capacity to translate
basic and clinical research to advance community health needs. In response to PAR-20-175, this
competitive renewal application consolidates our GP IDeA-CTR gains and advances the PARâs
objectives to further develop key infrastructure and human resources to meet CTR needs and health
challenges across our network by meeting 4 specific aims: 1) Further develop the infrastructure, services,
resources, and community relationships needed to expand funded CTR; 2) Expand professional development
activities in concert with the Pilot Projects Program (PPP) to cultivate a cadre of successful CTR investigators;
3) Strengthen collaborative partnerships across Nebraska and regional Great Plains IDeA states (the Dakotas
and Kansas); and 4) Create an environment that fosters innovative multidisciplinary, multisite, and cross-entity
(e.g., public-private) partnerships, IDeA (national CTR, COBRE, INBRE, ISPCTN, SEPA) and other national
(e.g., CTSAs) collaborations. We do so working together under strong leadership, with collaboration, support,
and advice from NIGMS, Internal and External Advisory Committees of strong CTR experts, and a Community
Advisory Board. The GP-IDeA CTR enhances partnerships across all Nebraska University System Institutions
(UNMC, UNO, UNL, and UNK) and Boys Town National Research Hospital, expands our institutional partner
network to include Creighton University, Childrenâs Hospital and Medical Center, and the Omaha VA. We
continue development of a community-anchored Practice-Based Research Network. We forge a new
relationship with the DaCCoTA CTR to strengthen CTR connections with Dakota institutions. We continue to
advance services and sustainable resources through our Cores (Administrative, Professional Development,
Biostatistics, Community Engagement, Biomedical Informatics, Tracking & Evaluation) and PPP, informed by
our experience and lessons learned from the first funding cycle. We sharpen our silo-spanning thematic focus
on team science and continue to advance innovation and entrepreneurship to catalyze movement across the
CTR spectrum and build capacity to bring community-relevant CTR ideas to the marketplace."
10708735,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The aim of this proposal is to improve the treatment of neonatal seizures. Neonatal seizures
affect 1 in 300 infants. Survivors have high rates (40-60%) of permanent disabilities such as
cerebral palsy, global developmental delay and epilepsy. There is mounting evidence that
seizures contribute to brain injury and neurodevelopmental disability; better treatment may
improve long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Despite the randomized NEOLEV2 clinical trial
showing greater seizure control with phenobarbital (PHB), PHB produced increased acute side
effects in comparison to standard dose Levetiracetam (LEV). These side effects included
respiratory suppression, hypotension, and sedation. Furthermore, there has been concern
regarding long-term neurocognitive side effects of PHB. This proposed project will refine the
standard clinical paradigm for neonatal seizure treatment by demonstrating a stratified approach;
using an anti-seizure treatment with a significantly improved effect profile, LEV, targeted at
reducing mild to moderate seizure burden, reserving PHB with its associated side effects for
neonates with high seizure burden.
 Research Objectives are to (1) optimize the use of a newer, safer, non-toxic anticonvulsant
medication for neonates with seizures and (2) develop technologies that will allow for accurate
immediate automated diagnosis of seizures.
 A dose escalation and safety study will be performed to determine the maximum tolerated
dose of LEV. Infants who continue to have seizures following standard dose LEV will receive either
higher dose LEV or the control drug PHB, randomized in a 3:1 allocation ratio. Dose escalation will
proceed in 3 phases to the maximal loading dose of 150mg/kg. A minimum of 10 subjects will be
studied at each dosing level and safety data will determine if dose limiting toxicity has been
demonstrated before further dose escalation. The primary endpoint will be the maximum tolerated
dose. A secondary endpoint will be the additional efficacy of higher doses of LEV compared with
standard dose LEV. The pharmacokinetics of high dose LEV in neonates will be studied.
 Facilitating early detection and rapid treatment of neonatal seizures is of equal importance to
developing better drugs in improving outcomes. The usefulness of current seizure detection
algorithms is limited by their low accuracy. Within the proposed study the accuracy of the new and
improved Persyst neonatal seizure detection algorithm will be evaluated."

Diabetes mellitus is a significant health burden in the U.S. and California leads the nation in incident cases and
costs of Type 2 Diabetes. Individuals with low socioeconomic status, older adults, rural populations, and racial
and ethnic minorities are at highest risk. The drivers of these disparities include a complex combination of
interacting factors at the individual, family, community, health system, societal, and policy levels. Programs and
policies that can effectively translate high-quality, evidence-based diabetes interventions into widespread
practice across diverse communities, modes of delivery, and a range of settings are desperately needed. The
Diabetes Research for Equity through Advanced Multilevel Science Center for Diabetes Translational
Research (DREAMS-CDTR) aims to advance health equity science through the development and translation
of: 1) innovations and structural changes to healthcare delivery systems that substantively reduce health
inequalities, and 2) innovative, scalable interventions to alter the socioenvironmental drivers of the Type 2
Diabetes epidemic and associated disparities.
Focusing on the northern California and Central Valley regions of California, the DREAMS-CDTR will conduct
clinical research and interventions designed to inform practice and policy change at the health system,
community and policy levels. The DREAMS-CDTR (formerly Health Delivery Systems) brings together
translational science core faculty who have expertise in diverse, multi-level areas including: food insecurity,
medication adherence, health communication, health IT, social policy, and cost effectiveness analysis.
DREAMS-CDTR will involve four regional academic sites with a range of public and non-profit health systems
that serve large and diverse populations: Kaiser Permanente Northern Californiaâs Division of Research and
the University of California at San Francisco, Merced and Davis.
The DREAMS-CDTR activities include: an Administrative Core, Pilot and Feasibility Program, Enrichment
Program, and three coordinated research cores - Health Equity & Action Translational (HEAT) core, Methods
and Data Integration (MDI) translational core, and National Diabetes Policy Research Resource (DPR) core.
The HEAT Core will employ a multi-level systems approach to designing rigorous action-oriented observational
and interventional research. The MDI Core will systematically prepare and support DREAMS-CDTR members
in harnessing novel advances in methods and data to achieve greater health equity in Type 2 Diabetes. Lastly,
the novel National DPR Core will extend the reach of the DREAMS-CDTR expertise and resources beyond the
primary institutions in five key areas of expertise: (1) natural experiments research,(2) health economics,
including comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness analysis; (3) simulation modeling, (4) machine
learning, and (5) communicating science to policy-making institutions, community partners, health
departments, and human service organizations."

The Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Disease Center of Excellence for Parkinsonâs Disease Research at Emory
University is a collaborative research program that studies the pathophysiology of parkinsonism with the goal
of optimizing the treatment for Parkinsonâs disease (PD). The Center draws upon the proven ability of the basal
ganglia research community at Emory to conduct collaborative translational research. Other Udall Center assets are the availability of primates for research at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory,
and the presence of one of the largest movement disorders clinic in the US. The Center consists of four projects and three cores. The planned research will shed light on the poorly understood parkinsonism-related activity changes of specifically identified groups of projection neurons in the cerebral cortex which, in turn, will
help us to better understand the pathophysiology of parkinsonism, and to optimize therapeutic strategies. Project 1 (led by Dr. Jaeger) will utilize rodent experiments for large-scale voltage imaging and brain slice recordings and use neural computational approaches to develop mechanistic models of cortical dysfunction in parkinsonism. Project 2 (Dr. Galvan), will explore the spontaneous and task-related activity of corticostriatal and
corticospinal neurons in the primary motor cortex (M1) and the supplementary motor area (SMA) in normal and
parkinsonian monkeys, using an opto-tagging approach to identify the projection targets of the recorded neurons. Project 3 (Dr. Smith) will examine morphological changes in the M1 and SMA microcircuitry and parkinsonism-associated changes in the connectome of cortical projection neurons in primates, a topic that is virtually unexplored and of high relevance to the interpretation of data in projects 1 and 2. The clinical âCatalystâ project 4 is an examination of parkinsonism-related changes in cortical activity in response inhibition tasks, studied
in electrocorticography and electroencephalography signals in patients with PD. The functional experiments
will also study the effects of levodopa and deep brain stimulation treatments in these paradigms. All projects
will be supported by an administrative core (Core A, Dr. Wichmann, PI; Dr. Smith, Associate Director, Ms
Holbrook, administrator), and by a service core that provides anatomical services to projects 1 and 2, behavioral assessments to projects 2 and 3, and statistical services to all projects (Core B, Dr. Galvan). A clinical
core (Core C) will support project 4 with recruitment and logistic services for the human studies. In addition to
pursuing its research mission (aim 1), the Center will help young scientists to develop their career in PD research (aim 2), and will engage in extensive outreach efforts, aimed at communicating the Centerâs (and Udall
Center network) research findings to the public (aim 3), reaching all age groups and background levels. As part
of the outreach agenda, the center plans to organize annual outreach events for patients and their caregivers.
Generous internal support funds will help the Center to fund some of its education and outreach missions, as
well as its pilot grant program, designed to expand PD research at Emory."
10891784,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Major Neurocognitive Disorders of Aging, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Alzheimer's Disease
Related Dementias (ADRD), produce cognitive declines that substantially affect daily living. To date, the
molecular processes underlying the neurodegeneration and cognitive declines that ultimately give rise to
AD/ADRD remain poorly understood. Recent developments in genome wide association study (GWAS)
provide promising avenues for identifying genetic variants and associated biological pathways of AD/ADRD
risk beyond those characterized by polymorphisms within the well-known APOE gene. However, a major
challenge to progress in AD/ADRD genomics is that contemporary methods used to diagnose AD/ADRDs for
epidemiological research often rely on cognitive assessments or clinical rating at a single point in time, which
are confounded by substantial variation in peak levels of cognitive function in early adulthood. Particularly
when peak levels of cognitive function are high, cognitive declines may go undetected for decades before
individuals present with impaired levels of functioning. Indeed, it has now become clear that by the time
AD/ADRD diagnoses are made, the pathophysiology of AD/ADRD and trajectories of accelerated cognitive
decline have accumulated extensively, during a so-called âsilent period.â These issues both dilute and bias
GWAS associations in conventional case-control, time-to-event, age-at-event, and single occasion designs.
The primary goal of the current R01 proposal is therefore to conduct the first large-scale consortium-based
GWAS of continuous rates of longitudinal aging-related cognitive change prior to dementia onset. This will
allow us to identify variants beyond those in the APOE gene that confer risk for rate of cognitive decline leading
to eventual AD/ADRD, estimate improved genome-wide polygenic scores that can be used to enhance
assessment of AD/ADRD risk, and identify novel biological pathways of AD/ADRD risk that can be targeted by
prevention and treatment efforts."
10687969,"Project Summary: Despite standard of care with maximal surgical resection, external beam radiotherapy, and
chemotherapy, patients with glioblastoma (GBM) live little more than 18 months after diagnosis; these outcomes
necessitate development of new targeted therapies. To address this gap, our group developed a novel vaccine
formulation that can unlock anti-tumor immunity within hours. By layering tumor mRNA into a multi-lamellar
nano-lipid formulation (for systemic administration), we can make tumor antigens appear like a systemic viral
infection. Our multi-lamellar design delivers increased antigenic load (per particle) triggering potent innate
activation which then facilitates adaptive effector responses. RNA-lipid nanoparticles (RNA-LPs) activate
systemic/intratumoral dendritic cells (DCs), upregulate critical innate gene signatures in the glioma
microenvironment, and induce glioma-specific T cell immunity. In murine tumor models resistant to immune
checkpoint inhibitors, RNA-LPs induce robust anti-tumor efficacy with long-term survivor benefits. We have
previously demonstrated safety of RNA-LPs in acute/chronic murine GLP toxicity studies and launched a large
animal canine glioma trial (IACUC#201609430). Our canine trial demonstrated that RNA-LP administration is
feasible, safe and immunologically active with improvement in overall survival in pet dogs with terminal gliomas
(compared with historical controls). We have since received FDA-IND approval (BB-IND#19304, Sayour) for first-
in-human studies (NCT04573140) in patients with GBM. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety,
maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and immunogenicity of RNA-LPs vaccines in newly-diagnosed adult GBM
patients. We hypothesize that RNA-LPs will mediate systemic immune reprogramming of GBM unlocking
immunotherapeutic activity. Our SPECIFIC AIMS are:
1. Conduct phase I study evaluating safety, MTD and immunogenicity of RNA-LPs against GBM.
 a. Characterize systemic immune response in patients prior to receiving RNA-LPs and effect
 change following vaccination.
 i. Identify immunologic phenotype of myeloid and lymphocyte subsets (naÃ¯ve, effector, memory,
 regulatory) and NK cells in patients with GBM at diagnosis and throughout therapy.
 ii. Elucidate changes in cytokine profile and pathogen-recognition receptor (PRR) activation
 status in patients with GBM during/after RNA-LP vaccines.
 iii. Identify potential tumor specific antigens as vaccine candidates through whole exome
 sequencing, RNA-seq, and neoantigen prediction analysis.
 b. Establish memory recall T cell immunity in vaccinated patients
 c. Determine if magnitude and persistence of anti-tumor innate and adaptive immunity correlates
 with clinical outcome."

The apparently random nature of seizures is one of the most significant factors affecting quality of life for patients
with epilepsy. Accurate seizure forecasting could be transformative for patients with epilepsy, allowing patients
to modify activities to avoid risk, take fast-acting medications to stop seizures before they develop, and provide
a sense of empowerment over their disease. Successful seizure prediction has now been established using
ambulatory intracranial EEG devices. Unfortunately, no such device is currently available to patients, as no
commercial vendor has been successful to date at obtaining approval for clinical use of such a device.
Furthermore, invasive intracranial implants may not be appropriate for or acceptable to many patients given the
associated risk of infection and hemorrhage. Subscalp EEG recording has recently emerged as a viable means
for long-term monitoring of patients with epilepsy. A device is commercially available in the EU, but does not
yet have FDA clearance in the US. Recently published studies show the device to be reliable and robust, and
recordings longer than 6 months have been reported. In addition cycles of seizure risk have been identified in
wearable device physiological signals, and these long-term cycles may be capable of contributing to the
accuracy of seizure forecasts. This project will develop the ability to prospectively forecast seizures from
simultaneous subscalp EEG and wrist-worn wearable signals, and will assess the safety and feasibility of
administering a fast-acting supplemental medication with seizure forecasts to prevent seizures."

While considerable evidence is available for prevention and care of diabetes, huge gaps remain in equitable
and sustainable translation of this knowledge into practice and policy in clinical and community settings. To
close these gaps, the Georgia Center for Diabetes Translation Research (GCDTR), has leveraged the
multidisciplinary expertise and experience in Atlanta, by bringing together collaborations among researchers
from several leading institutions, namely, Emory's Rollins School of Public Health, School of Medicine, School
of Nursing, and Goizueta Business School; Georgia Institute of Technology; and Morehouse School of
Medicine. Having successfully expanded the translation research (from $15 to $33 million annually), and
investigators (from 38 to 102 members, including 26 newly recruited diabetes faculty) bases, GCDTR will
embrace the vision of equity and strive to close the gaps in diabetes prevention and care across demographic
and comorbid groups, especially in socially, economically, and ethnically disadvantaged populations. GCDTR
will include an Administrative Core A, seamlessly coordinating three interconnected translation research cores:
(1) Core B, Design and Evaluation for Equity, emphasizing measurement and learning from previous
experiencesâboth successes and failuresâthrough appropriate metrics and evaluation and innovating for the
future (design) to help stimulate progress; (2) Core C, Socio-ecological and Behavioral Sciences for Equity,
bringing a wealth of interdisciplinary experiences in developing theoretically-based interventions and
innovative, technology-driven engagement methodologies promoting the adoption and maintenance of health-
promoting behaviors among vulnerable populations; and (3) a Regional Core, Technologies Advancing
Translation and Equity, and expanding partnerships to include institution in neighboring Florida and Tennessee
â southeastern states that have historically had large underserved areas and populations at high risk for
diabetes. Enrichment and Pilot and Feasibility Programs will continue to enhance young and transitioning
investigators' capacity to be competitive for NIH funds in translation research and have impact on diabetes

10795731,"Project Summary
Electrical stimulation of deep brain structures is an essential tool for the causal investigation of neural systems
that regulate learning and decision making. Deep brain electrical stimulation is also a valuable tool for treating
neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and tremor, and recent data suggests that electrical brain
stimulation may effectively treat epilepsy and severe depression. Despite its scientific and translational
applications, little is known about how electrical stimulation affects the ongoing activities of neurons or the
release of neuromodulators such as dopamine. Understanding how electrical stimulation affects dopamine
release is particularly important given dopamine's involvement in learning, motor control, decision making, and
neuroplasticity. There is considerable evidence that dopamine's function is determined by the time course of
release. For example, fast, âphasicâ release (~1-2 seconds) is involved in neuroplasticity and reward-guided
learning while slow, âtonicâ release (tens of seconds) is involved in motor control and motivation. Little is known
about how the brain selectively regulates tonic and phasic release, and few methods exist for controlling the
time course of dopamine release. Developing such methods could result in 1) new experimental approaches
for the causal investigation of the roles phasic and tonic release play in motivation and motor control, and 2)
translational tools to correct disrupted patterns of dopamine release in disorders such as Parkinson's disease,
schizophrenia, addiction, and depression. Towards these goals, evidence from our group suggests that the
frequency and duration of electrical brain stimulation allows selective control of the time course of dopamine
release. Our general objective is to characterize how parameters of brain stimulation such as stimulation
frequency, variability, and the brain region targeted impacts the time-course of dopamine release and
dopamine's role in reward-guided learning. Our experimental objectives are to determine (1) how the frequency
and variability of the sequence of pulses delivered during brain stimulation affects phasic and tonic dopamine
release, (2) how brain stimulation and tonic and phasic signaling interact to affect reward-driven learning, and
(3) and how tonic and phasic signaling affect interactions between neurons and shape neuroplasticity. Our
experimental approaches involve voltammetry for dopamine measurement, neural ensemble recordings for
measurement of neural coordination, optogenetics, and on-line optimization of dopamine release in
anesthetized and behaving rats. Our computational objective is to use data collected to develop multi-scale
systems and cellular models that describe how stimulation frequency and variance affect the time course of
dopamine release. We predict that multi-scale models will outperform current synaptic models and improve the
capacity of scientists and clinicians to control dopamine release in experimental and therapeutic settings.
These models may also explain clinical effects such as recent data from human patients suggesting that
electrical stimulation of deep brain regions reduces depression."

 The Michigan Center for Diabetes Translational Research (MCDTR) supports 110 current members,
regional, national, and international collaborators, and aims to engage and support new members in multiple
disciplines to conduct T2-T4 diabetes research with a specific emphasis on novel approaches to measure and
improve health equity. Over past years, the MCDTR has expanded its research base focused on community
and health system interventions that span T2-T4 translation. There is a great need now to support new
research evaluating novel approaches to improve health equity in diabetes prevention and management and to
incorporate rigorous measurement of and innovative strategies to improve health equity within all our
members' research. We aim to promote research that supports the development, implementation, evaluation,
and dissemination of effective interventions, programs, and policies that improve health outcomes and equity.
The MCDTR will:1) Raise awareness of and interest in T2-T4 translational research in diabetes and create an
environment that supports important and innovative research; 2) Foster and help sustain multidisciplinary,
novel, and cross-sectoral collaborations, including with multiple health and social service organizations where
appropriate to advance emerging scientific areas of translational and health equity research; 3) Provide core
services to support membersâ research programs using best practices in translational and health equity
research; 4) Through enrichment, pilot and feasibility grant, and other programs, attract, develop, and support
early and other researchers to conduct research that improves diabetes prevention, treatment, population
health, and health equity.
The Center supports four cores. The Administration Core maintains the Research Base and is responsible
for the MCDTR's direction, functioning, finances, and web site. It administers the Pilot and Feasibility Study
Grants Program, the Enrichment Program, and the Cross-Sectoral Collaborations initiative that fosters and
sustains partnerships between MCDTR investigators and multiple sectoral partners that span local and state
health departments, federally qualified health centers, and community organizations. The Evaluation Methods
and Intervention Strategies Core focuses on cutting-edge design and analysis methods and technology-based
approaches to intervention delivery, cross-sectoral communication, and outreach to improve access of and
ongoing support to populations facing health disparities. The Addressing Social and Behavioral Determinants
of Health Core provides expertise on state-of-the art approaches to identify, measure, and meet unmet socio-
economic needs and design interventions and policies that effectively address both social and behavioral
determinants of improved diabetes and population health outcomes. The Leveraging Community, Family, and
Peer Support Core helps investigators design and evaluate novel intervention approaches that effectively
mobilize and evaluate different types and combinations of community, family, and peer support to both address
social needs and support healthy behaviors to improve diabetes prevention, management, and equity."
10929926,"Background: Electronic health records (EHRs) can improve communication processes but unique vulnerabilities
remain. Failure to follow-up abnormal test results (âmissed resultsâ) is a key preventable factor in diagnostic
delays in the VHA and often involves EHR-based communication breakdowns. Our work, as well as data from
root cause analyses and malpractice claims in the VA, highlights many technical and âsocialâ (i.e., workflow,
organizational, people, and policy) variables that affect test results communication and follow-up.
Objectives: We will develop and evaluate a new program for surveillance and improvement of test results-
related diagnostic safety. This will include development, implementation, and evaluation of a change package
(i.e., a catalogue of strategies, change concepts, and action steps that guide participants in their improvement
efforts15) that identifies and addresses risks that predispose health systems to missed test results.
Unique features & Innovation: In a 2017 National Quality Forum report âImproving Diagnostic Quality and
Safetyâ, several measurement concepts related to test results follow-up were proposed for further development.
We developed and tested a novel electronic indicator system of triggers for missed test results, which uses
automated methods to find patients meeting specific criteria using Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) data.
Triggers are signals that can identify patients at higher risk of harm and alert providers to review records for
potential patient safety events. Our team has used triggers to identify specific data patterns to facilitate selective
chart reviews. We have achieved reasonable positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values
(NPVs), and aim to have these tools used at the system level to measure care delays more efficiently. This
measurement system has the potential to become a near real-time surveillance system to identify patients whose
test results might have been missed. However, identifying safety deficits using triggers within the CDW is only
the first step. For these reports to result in improvements, a team (clinical or organization-based) must analyze
the data and create a feedback system to generate learning and improvements. Our change package aims to
help VA facility-based teams implement a surveillance and improvement program, ensure that safety
measurement will translate into action and help them create back-up systems to monitor diagnostic delays.
Methods: Working with 2 operational partners (NCPS and VA Primary Care), our specific aims are:
Aim 1: Develop and pilot test a âchange packageâ (SAFER Change Package) to provide VA facilities guidance
on how to implement a surveillance and feedback program related to missed test results.
Aim 2: Evaluate if the âSAFER TRACKSâ Intervention (SAFER Change Package delivered using a Virtual
Breakthrough Series [VBTS] Collaborative supplemented with automated surveillance data on test results) can
reduce missed results using a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized control trial. Our outcome measures will be
the rate of missed test results, determined through random manual medical record review conducted nationally
as part of the VHA performance-measurement system, as well as automated `trigger' indicators of missed test
results. We hypothesize there will be fewer missed test results in participating sites during the SAFER TRACKS
Intervention as compared to during the pre-intervention period.
Aim 3: Evaluate the implementation of the SAFER TRACKS Intervention through mixed-methods in order to
determine strengths and challenges at participating sites.
Our outputs will include multifaceted socio-technical tools and strategies to help prevent, detect, mitigate, and
ameliorate breakdowns in EHR-based communication that often lead to missed test results in the VHA.
Significance: The project is responsive to âTargeted Solicitation for Health Services Research on Data and
Measurement Sciences â A Learning Health Care System Initiativeâ and to HSR&D's Major Priority Domain of
Healthcare Informatics and Sub-domain for innovative uses of information technology to improve diagnosis."
10491103,"Abstract
Becker dystrophy is caused by partial loss of function of the dystrophin protein in muscle tissues and some
non-muscle cells, with progressive dysfunction of skeletal and cardiac muscle. Mutations of the DMD gene
cause both Becker dystrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD); DMD is complete loss of dystrophin,
whereas Becker dystrophy patients retain partly functional dystrophin in muscle that reduces the severity of the
progressive disease. Therapeutic efforts for DMD have significantly advanced over the last decade, with 4
drugs now approved by FDA for DMD. Clinical research in Becker dystrophy is under-represented relative to
DMD, with no drugs approved, and few drug development efforts. This discordance in therapeutic efforts is
likely partly due to somewhat lower prevalence of Becker dystrophy vs. DMD in the USA (Becker dystrophy
0.36/10,000; DMD 1.02/10,000), and the very variable clinical phenotype of Becker dystrophy (complicating
interpretation of outcomes in clinical trials). Corticosteroids (prednisone and Emflaza) are considered standard
of care for DMD, but not Becker dystrophy, as patients and their physicians generally feel that the poor safety
profile of chronic corticosteroid use outweighs benefits in strength and mobility. Here, we seek to initiate clinical
development of vamorolone (a partial dissociative agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor, and antagonist of the
mineralocorticoid receptor) for Becker dystrophy. Vamorolone shows unique structure/activity relationships
compared to the corticosteroid class and has shown preliminary data in DMD suggestive of retention of
efficacy but loss of safety concerns of the corticosteroid class of drugs. Vamorolone may show improved
efficacy in Becker dystrophy compared to DMD, as vamorolone has been shown to inhibit dystrophin mRNA-
targeting microRNAs, and thus is anticipated to increase dystrophin levels in Becker dystrophy patient muscle.
Thus, vamorolone may have multiple mechanisms of action of efficacy in Becker dystrophy: 1. Inhibition of pro-
inflammatory NF-ÎºB pathways; 2. Increase in dystrophin content of muscle via dystrophin-targeting microRNA
inhibition; 3. Cardiac benefit via mineralocorticoid antagonism. Aim 1 of the proposed research is to evaluate
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 6mg/kg/day vamorolone for 24 weeks treatment of patients with Becker
dystrophy. Aim 2 is to evaluate treatment responsiveness of serum biomarkers over 24 weeks vamorolone
treatment of patients with Becker dystrophy. Aim 3 is to use open-label functional outcome data (NSAA,
TTRW), carry out sample size calculations to adequately power and design a registration trial of vamorolone in
Becker dystrophy."

The University of Michigan Minority Health and Health Disparities International Research Training (MHIRT)
Program has offered opportunities for training and participation in international research over the last 23 years
to 489 students, almost all of whom are from health disparity populations. The majority of these students have
transitioned into careers in research or practice in the biomedical, behavioral, clinical or social science fields,
often working with directly underserved populations. The University of Michigan wishes to continue this highly
effective program that has successfully engaged under represented students in research on problems that
disproportionately affect the health of poor and minority communities, and especially children, in low and
middle income countries and the U.S. Student research experiences occur within the framework of ongoing
collaborative studies of University of Michigan faculty members in three geographic regions: the Americas
(Chile, Nicaragua, Trinidad & Tobago, United States); Africa (Ghana and Uganda); and Asia (India and
Mongolia). These projects provide a broad range of training opportunities focused on both physical health
and/or behavioral health issues as well as the social-cultural-environmental determinants of health. In addition,
pre- and post-doctoral students will be offered the opportunity to train on more specialized topics of relevance
to health disparities with individual mentors at other local or foreign research sites. Ten students will be offered
training each year (2 undergraduate; 2 post-baccalaureate; 3 pre-doctoral; and 3 post-doctoral trainees). The
training program comprises: 1) one semester of pre-departure preparation including a course specific to the
program; 2) extended close mentoring in the U.S. and at international sites; 3) research involving design of a
study or subproject (if appropriate), collection, analysis, and interpretation of original data, and presentation of
the research project in oral and written form; 4) closely-supervised training overseas for 12 weeks or more for
pre- and post- doctoral trainees; and 5) post-trip follow-up including career guidance; facilitation of further
research placements; opportunities for independent study programs; mentoring related to honors theses and
doctoral dissertations; and assistance in preparing presentations and peer review manuscripts for publication.
Minority and/or junior faculty investigators engaged in research on health inequalities in the U.S. are
encouraged to develop projects into studies that can be carried out at the foreign sites. The University of
Michiganâs program has been highly successful at leveraging funds from other University of Michigan
academic units to support additional students and will continue to seek out sponsors for qualified trainees. In
the current funding cycle, we have been able to fund an additional 34 trainees, all with co-support from other
units, which is a model we would plan to continue in the future."
10760254,"Immune signal perception and integration by cell surface receptors and peptide ligands
Plants and animals rely on pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect infection by recognizing microbe-
associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). Plant plasma membrane (PM)-resident receptor kinases (RKs) function
as PRRs that sense MAMPs from diverse microbes and collectively contribute to plant immunity. Plant RKs also
perceive a wide range of extrinsic and intrinsic signals and regulate growth, reproduction, and environmental
adaptation. The signaling pathways mediated by many RKs converge at a subfamily of RKs, namely
BAK1/SERKs, that function as shared coreceptors associating with various receptors upon ligand perception
modulating plant immunity, growth, and immune homeostasis. The PM-tethered cytoplasmic kinase BIK1
associates with multiple PRR-BAK1 complexes and relays the intracellular signaling events. Microbial infection
also induces the gene expression of many secreted peptides, which could function as immunomodulatory
phytocytokines perceived by PRRs and fortify plant immunity. This proposal's long-term goal is to elucidate the
mechanisms underlying pathogen signal perception and integration by PRR complexes via shared modules in
coordination with phytocytokines for a rapid, specific, and robust immune response. The proposed research will
address several key questions in the field. The project will elucidate how BIK1-associated PRR receptorsome
dynamics are spatiotemporally regulated and relay the diverse immune signaling. As a critical kinase, BIK1
homeostasis, activities, and subcellular dynamics are regulated by the intertwined phosphorylation and
ubiquitination modifications. The project will define how the shared BAK1/SERK coreceptors maintain the
functional specificity in different receptorsomes. The studies will address how signaling specificity is regulated
with the single-cell resolution at the organismal level. The project will also study how immunomodulatory
phytocytokines coordinate with microbial patterns to mount effective immunity. The proposed interdisciplinary
research will provide ample training opportunities for researchers at different levels, including underrepresented
undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and will advance our understanding of innate
immunity and signal transduction at the whole organismal level by identifying new components and delineating
novel pathways that regulate immune signal integration, signaling activation, attenuation, and specificity.

10798272,"ABSTRACT
Prion diseases are a group of infectious neurodegenerative disorders affecting humans and other
mammals, which are transmitted by an unconventional proteinaceous infectious agent termed prion. CWD
is so far the only prion disease of wild animals; it is highly contagious and the exact origin, prevalence, and
mechanisms of transmission remain incompletely understood. The progressive increase of CWD prevalence in
the USA has likely resulted in a substantial contamination of the environment with infectious prions and may
lead to new prion diseases in animals that share the habitat of cervids. The disease has been rapidly
expanding geographically and now affects 27 states in USA, three Canadian provinces, South Korea and
Northern Europe, including Norway, Sweden and Finland. The risk of transmission of CWD to other animal
species or to humans is unknown and surveillance methods to detect the infection in non-cervid species are
limited.
This Program Project has received continuous funding for the past 11 years, which has enabled us to
implement a large and complementary set of unique techniques, model systems, reagents, personnel and
expertise crucial to understand the CWD problem. In the last competitive review, we received a perfect
score of 10 and reviewers identified many strengths and ânot any significant weaknessâ. The progress
during this cycle has been stellar, with many important discoveries and 118 high profile publications. The
main goal of this iteration of the Program Project will be to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms
responsible for prion replication and prion strain diversity in CWD. We will study the generation, mutation and
evolution of CWD prion strains, the inter-species transmission potential of CWD (with particular focus on its
zoonotic potential) and the role of the environment on CWD transmission. This Program Project aims to
address some of the most important questions in CWD research, including the possibly origin of CWD, the
mechanism and routes of transmission of the disease among animals, the natural strain diversity of CWD, the
atomic resolution structure of infectious prions, the evaluation of the zoonotic potential of CWD, the factors
controlling the cervid/human species barrier, the role of the environment on prion transmission and the
development of efficient procedures to detect infectious CWD prions. To achieve these goals, this Program
Project assembles a group of highly accomplished scientists in the prion field, particularly experts on CWD
transmission, who have access to the relevant models, techniques, samples, resources and expertise to
provide a complementary and comprehensive investigation of the problem."
10755249,"PPG Title: New Approaches to Reduce Residual Cardiovascular Risk
SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In the last 40 years, significant progress has been made in reducing cardiovascular events by lowering plasma
LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C). While statins and PCSK9 inhibitors effectively decrease LDL-C levels, significant
residual risk of CHD remains even in maximally treated individuals with low plasma levels of LDL-C.
Epidemiological and genetic studies suggest that a significant proportion of the residual risk is due to elevated
plasma levels of triglyceride-rich ApoB-Containing Lipoproteins (ApoBCLs). The three projects that comprise
this Program Project Grant (PPG) will elucidate new molecular mechanisms that regulate the synthesis,
secretion, and metabolism of ApoBCLs. Our PPG is comprised of distinguished investigators with a longstanding
history of collaboration, five of whom (Goldstein, Brown, Hobbs, Horton, and Cohen) have worked together for
25 years. In Project 1 of this new PPG, Radhakrishnan, Brown, and Goldstein have used an original and
innovative screening protocol to identify a cholesterol-mimetic small molecule that binds to Scap with high
specificity and blocks activation of SREBPs, the transcription factors that activate genes required for the
synthesis of cholesterol, fatty acids (FAs), and triglycerides (TGs). This compound will be used to elucidate the
molecular mechanism by which Scap senses sterols, enabling the first description of Scapâs cholesterol binding
site at atomic resolution. The current cholesterol mimetic compound and more potent derivatives in development
will be used to assess the clinical implications of a Scap inhibitor for reduction of plasma ApoBCLs. In Project
2, Horton, Kim, and Liang have identified a new lipogenic enzyme complex in liver. They will characterize
components of the FA synthesis complex and determine how this complex interacts with additional FA modifying
proteins and acyl-transferases required to synthesize TGs and ApoBCLs. Completion of the proposed studies
will identify new opportunities for therapeutic interventions to reduce the synthesis of FAs, TGs, and VLDL. In
Project 3, Hobbs and Cohen used population-based resequencing to identify loss-of-function mutations in
angiopoietin-like (ANGPTL) 3 and 8. They showed that mutations in either protein result in lower plasma LDL-
cholesterol and TG levels. Their studies will elucidate the mechanisms underlying the ApoBCL lowering effects
of ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8. In the process, they will define a new pathway that promotes clearance of ApoBCLs
independently of the LDL receptor.
The Research Projects will be supported by three Cores: Administrative, Tissue Culture & Antibody Production,
and Mass Spectrometry.
Members of this PPG have a long record of collaborative interactions and exceptional productivity. We
will continue to focus on bold hypotheses designed to answer critical questions. The investigators take
special pride in publishing papers that are characterized by originality and scientific rigor. The
successful completion of our projects holds great promise for exposing new therapeutic opportunities
for the reduction of plasma ApoBCLs and residual cardiovascular risk."

named âWaâ Kan yeâ zah (Little Holy One),â with Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux caregivers and their 3-to-5-
year-old children. The intervention aims to: 1) reduce symptoms of historical trauma and everyday stress
among parents/caregivers, 2) improve parenting, and 3) improve childrenâs emotional and behavioral
developmental outcomes to reduce future risk for suicide and substance use. The scientific premise of this
work is rooted in understanding that high rates of historical and current trauma in Native communities
compromise caregiversâ mental health and parenting, which in turn affect early childhood behavior problems
and adverse events that increase childrenâs risk for suicide and substance use in adolescent and young
adulthood. Without intervention, this intergenerational cycle may repeat. Waâ Kan yeâ zah will combine adapted
elements of: 1) Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, an evidence-based intervention proven
effective to reduce stress, depression and trauma-related symptoms, 2) Family Spirit, an evidence-based
parent training program to promote positive early child development in Native American communities, and 3)
cultural components informed by tribal-specific risk and protective factors for suicide and substance abuse
identified in community-based studies that led to this proposal. The intervention will consist of 12 weekly
individual lessons taught to parents and children (ages 3 to 5) at the Poplar and Wolf Point Head Start facilities
by indigenous community health workers, a delivery strategy selected to enhance participant engagement,
local acceptability and sustainability. Intervention timing is focused at a critical developmental phaseâwhen
primary attachment is still to parents, but while children are transitioning to greater self-regulation and
cooperation with teachers and peers in Head Start classrooms. This study will use a randomized control trial
(RCT) with an embedded single-case experimental design (SCED) to determine the effectiveness of the
intervention on mental health and behavioral outcomes among N=120 parent-child dyads, while empirically
exploring the added benefit of specific cultural components on parent/caregiver outcomes. on mental health
and behavioral outcomes among N=120 parent-child dyads, while exploring the added benefit of cultural

Excellence (COBRE). The proposed Center would be the first and only NIH-funded COBRE research center to
focus solely on injury control. The objective of this proposal is to establish and build a COBRE Center to support
the research activities of project research leaders to ensure their transition to independently funded scientists.
This objective will be met through the following specific aims: 1) establish the cores (Administrative Core, Injury
Control Digital Innovation Core & Injury Control Research to Practice and Policy Core) needed to develop and
sustain a thematic multidisciplinary center of research excellence on injury control and to 2) support the selection,
mentorship, and career development of early career faculty through the COBREâs research studies and a pilot
study program. The RIH Injury Control COBRE research studies will target the entire spectrum of injury
prevention (primary, secondary, tertiary) with individuals across the lifecycle (children, emerging adults and older
adults). The three initial RPLs are three women junior faculty with outstanding potential to make significant
contribution to injury science research: Leslie Brick, PhD, Elizabeth Goldberg, MD, ScM and Stephanie Ruest,
MD, MPH. In addition, a pilot project program will support research proposals for future junior investigators to
continue the growth of independent researchers. This mentored pilot program will allow early work to commence
on important injury control topics with innovative research and allow those projects to proceed and become later
Research Projects within the COBRE or to progress directly to independent funding. RIH has a strong core of
senior researchers in the field of injury control science; however, our pipeline of researchers will run dry if we do
not expand and replenish researchers capable of injury control research excellence. The RIH Injury Control
COBRE will bring together junior investigators, senior faculty and advisory committee members to build a center
which produces high level, independent researchers equipped to address and improve the substantial burden
injury has on population health. It will be continuously and rigorously evaluated allowing for constant
improvement and preparing our institution to accelerate its production of high-quality innovative injury control
research and researchers."

Loss of ovarian function at menopause is hypothesized to be a risk factor for Alzheimerâs disease and related
dementias. Research in preclinical models indicates that estrogens are neuroprotective and can positively
impact the cognitive aging trajectory. However, clinical data have been equivocal as to the benefits of
menopausal estrogen therapy to the brain and cognition. Variation in response to estrogen therapy in women
suggests that pre-existing disease such as hypertension and metabolic syndrome can modulate mechanisms
of estrogen action. These alterations may consequently reduce or reverse protections estrogens provide
against cognitive decline, Alzheimerâs disease, and related dementias. The Program objective is to determine
the impact of cardiometabolic status on the ability of exogenously administered estrogens to benefit the brain
and cognition in an aging female rodent model. The overall hypothesis is that administration of estrogens in
aging females will benefit the brain and cognition if initiated in healthy subjects, but will provide no benefits if
initiated in the presence of cardiometabolic disease. Mechanisms by which these divergent effects occur are
hypothesized to involve both alterations in mechanisms by which estrogens act directly on brain memory
systems and mechanisms by which estrogens act on cardiometabolic systems, which in turn impact brain
memory systems. Experiments under the four Projects will test this hypothesis. Project 1 will test the
hypothesis that cardiometabolic disease, due to associated dysfunction of the ubiquitin/proteasome system,
will disrupt the ability of estrogens to regulate levels of ERÎ± in the hippocampus, regulation that is necessary
for midlife estradiol treatment to exert lasting impacts on memory. Project 2 will test the hypothesis that the
presence of cardiometabolic disease impedes estrogenâs beneficial cognitive effects by blunting neurovascular
coupling via endothelial nitric oxide synthase uncoupling, thus impairing the local network activity and synaptic
plasticity required to preserve functional cortical circuits and therefore for cognition. Project 3 will test the
hypothesis that cardiovascular disease alters the estrogen receptor profile, altering downstream molecular
signaling pathways and attenuating its protective vascular effects and subsequent impact on cognition. Project
4 will test the hypothesis that insulin resistance caused by high fat diet impairs downstream signaling pathways
necessary for estradiolâs beneficial influence on central regulation of glucose homeostasis, hippocampal long-
term potentiation, and hippocampus-dependent cognitive function. The Administrative Core will provide
leadership to the Program and ensure integration of all Program components. The Cardiometabolic and
Hormones and Behavior Cores will provide critical consistencies in models and procedures to ensure scientific
rigor and reproducibility of results across projects. Results will identify conditions under which estrogen
treatment will (or will not) change the cognitive aging trajectory that could potentially reduce or delay age-
related cognitive disease including Alzheimerâs disease and vascular dementia."

10614522,"ABSTRACT
National initiatives in precision medicine, such as the All of Us Research Program, have set ambitious plans
to establish a research cohort of one million or more participants and enable a new era of medicine that
empowers patients, researchers, and providers to work together toward development of individualized
treatments. A central challenge to large-scaled precision medicine research is the return of individual genetic
research results to study participants. Yet, approaches to scale the return of clinically actionable genetic results
to large cohorts have not been well-tested to date. The magnitude of this endeavor has renewed concerns
about the shortage of qualified genetic counselors for this task. Rigorous research efforts are thus needed to
test the efficacy of alternate models for genetic results disclosure, which has widespread implications for how
precision medicine research might yield direct benefits for study participants. We propose to conduct a
randomized controlled trial (RCT) within the Black Women's Health Study (BWHS) to test alternate
communication modalities for results disclosure. The BWHS is an ongoing prospective cohort study of 59,000
self-identified black women from across the United States who have been followed since 1995. Targeted
sequencing of over 4000 women within the cohort for BRCA1/2 and other known or suspected high and
moderate penetrance genes opens up the possibility of returning breast cancer genetic results to BWHS
participants and examining the clinical utility of genetic results return. The primary aim of the proposed
research project is to compare the efficacy of two communication modalities for returning breast cancer genetic
research results to African American women: 1) a conventional modality that entails telephone disclosure by a
licensed genetic counselor, and 2) an online self-guided modality that entails returning results directly to
participants, with optional genetic counselor follow-up via telephone. Secondary aims of this study will examine
1) moderators of the intervention impact and 2) psychosocial, sociodemographic, and clinical predictors of
result uptake. This study is uniquely situated to provide critical empirical evidence on the effectiveness of
alternate models for genetic results return and provide further insight into the factors influencing uptake of
genetic information among African American women. Study findings will inform ongoing efforts to establish
scalable approaches for effective return of genetic research results, and increase access to personal health
information among African American women."
10899421,"SUMMARY - OVERALL
Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in hematopoietic stem cell
transplant (HSCT) patients who often exhibit myelosuppression associated with virus infection. CD34+
Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells (HPCs) are a critical reservoir of latent HCMV that upon cytokine and growth
factor signals differentiate into monocytes that further differentiate into macrophages activating production of
infectious virus in tissues. Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signaling pathways in CD34+ HPCs are
critical not only for determining HCMV latency and reactivation but also for regulating progenitor cell homeostasis
and hematopoiesis. Over the past 3.5 years we have identified critical EGFR signaling pathways regulated by
UL138, UL136, UL135, US28, UL7, UL8, and multiple HCMV miRNAs that are important to maintain latency or
induce viral reactivation. Most of these pathways are integrally linked with CD34+ HPC proliferation for
maintenance of the progenitor cell in the bone marrow niche as well as myelopoiesis. We have shown that
multiple HCMV miRNAs synergistically or antagonistically work together with HCMV proteins to regulate these
signaling pathways necessary for latency or viral reactivation. In addition, we have observed that UL138 is
associated with proteins involved in STAT1 signaling and that HCMV miRNAs target some of these factors. We
hypothesize that UL138-WDR48-USP1 and -USP12 interactions along with US28 and the HCMV miRNAs
regulate a STAT1 and AKT response to suppress virus replication for latency. We have also shown that US28
signaling induced by chemokines regulate latency or reactivation and is ligand specific. Additionally, we have
observed that US28 activation of RhoA is highly regulated by HCMV miRNAs as well as UL8 signaling through
the non-canonical Wnt pathway. We hypothesize that MEK/ERK signaling is essential to maintain latency while
activation of the RhoA pathway is necessary for reactivation.
While the current HCMV PPG has focused on identification of UL138, UL136, UL135, US28, UL7, and viral
miRNA EGFR signaling targets, the proposed renewal will focus on how the different HCMV genes interact with
one another to regulate these pathways and how they control the virus life cycle. The complexity of signaling
events and approaches to comprehensively address questions on viral latency and hematopoiesis can only be
achieved through a collaborative effort under a PPG mechanism. Therefore we propose five highly integrated
research projects (Project 1: UL133/8 regulation of host cell signaling in viral latency and reactivation; Project 2:
miRNA regulation of host cell signaling in viral latency and reactivation; Project 3: US28 regulation of host cell
signaling in viral latency and reactivation; Project 4: UL7-8 regulation of host cell signaling in viral latency and
reactivation; Project 5: HCMV regulation of monocyte/macrophage host cell signaling in viral reactivation), two
scientific cores (Humanized Mouse Core; Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core) to service these projects, and
an Administrative Core to oversee and coordinate the entire program."

The University of Virginia Cancer Center (UVACC) is a matrix cancer center that brings together 162
Members from 25 Departments in the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, and Engineering, and in the College of
Arts and Sciences. The UVACC receives $12.06M direct costs from NCI, $19.40M from other peer-reviewed
sources, and $7.44M from non-peer-reviewed sources, for a total of $38.91M in overall direct cost funding.
The members are highly productive and collaborative, having published 1,016 Program-selected
publications, of which 27% are intra-programmatic, 11% are inter-programmatic, and 45% are
collaborative with other NCI Cancer Centers. Of these publications, 26% have an impact factor of 10 or
greater. Through faculty recruitment and robust infrastructure development, the UVACC has continued to
build on its exceptional basic science foundations. Since the last renewal, UVACC has greatly enhanced its
ability to accelerate clinical and translational cancer focused research and has built a robust population
science program. Sixty nine new Members have joined the UVACC, including twenty four basic scientists,
ten translational researchers, nineteen clinical investigators and sixteen population scientists. The UVACC
has four Programs: Cancer Biology (CBIO), Molecular Genetics and Epigenetics (GEN), Cancer
Therapeutics (CRX), and Cancer Control and Population Health (CPH). This application requests support
for seven Shared Resources: Advanced Microscopy Facility (AMF), Biomolecular Analysis Facility (BAF),
Biostatistics Shared Resource (BSR), Biorepository and Tissue Research Facility (BTRF), Flow Cytometry
Core (FCC), Molecular and Immunological Translational Sciences Core (MITS), and Population Health and
Cancer Outcomes Core (PHCOC). In addition, we request support for UVACC Senior Leadership, an
Administration Core, Planning and Evaluation, Developmental Funds, a Cancer Research Career
Enhancement Core (CRCE), Community Outreach and Engagement (COE), Clinical Protocol and Data
Management (CPDM), and a Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS). The mission of the UVACC
is to reduce the burden of cancer for the patients of today, through skilled, integrated, and
compassionate care and to eliminate the threat of cancer for the patients of tomorrow, through
research and education in an environment that promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion. Because it is
a matrix cancer center that is fully integrated within a leading public university, the UVACC has a
special opportunity and responsibility to bring a diverse universe of new knowledge and technology into
cancer research and care for the people in its catchment area. The UVACC is requesting Cancer
Center Support Grant (CCSG) funding and designation as an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer

10576794,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1-2% of children in the United States. The etiology(ies) and
neurobiological underpinnings of autism remains unclear and hence targets for effective medical treatments
are rare. While myriad genetic mouse models have been created, and many demonstrate some phenotypic
features of autism, there is growing concern that rodent models may not be the best approach for creating
phenocopies of childhood disorders, such as autism, that have cognitive and social disabilities as their core
features. Over the last 5 years, through the use of techniques such as CRISPR/Cas9, there has been a
revolution in genetically modifying organisms that can be applied to large species such as nonhuman primates
(NHP). A first goal of this application is to develop a nonhuman primate model of ASD through loss of function
modifications to the CHD8 gene. The gene encoding the chromatin remodeler CHD8 is among the most
frequently mutated genes in individuals with ASD. The CHD8 form of autism is unique in being both highly
penetrant and having a behavioral and neurobiological phenotype. Individuals with loss of function of this gene
not only have autism but typically demonstrate macrocephaly/megalencephaly. We have selected this gene as
a starting point because UC Davis Co-investigators on this application have been developing mouse models
with Chd8 mutations and analysis of megalencephaly is a major focus of a recently funded Autism Center of
Excellence at the MIND Institute. A second goal of the application is to build capacity and expertise in
generating genetically modified nonhuman primate models of neurodevelopmental disorders. We argue that
UC Davis, with its California National Primate Research Center that houses over 4000 rhesus monkeys, the
Mouse Biology Program that has expertise in genetic manipulations leading to hundreds of clinically significant
mouse models, and the MIND Institute which houses expertise on all facets of neurodevelopmental disorders
research from genetics to clinical trials, is extraordinarily well-positioned to generate and comprehensively
evaluate these animal models. We will establish a Leadership Group that will guide this program to successful
development of valuable nonhuman primate models of neurodevelopmental disorders. For this initial phase of
studies we propose 1) to implement strategies for gene editing of the nonhuman primate, validation of gene
editing and efficient production of embryos for later implantation 2) to produce up to ten live rhesus monkeys
with Chd8 loss of function mutations 3) to determine normal and abnormal trajectories of structural and
functional brain development for rhesus monkeys with Chd8 loss of function mutations and 4) to carry out
behavioral analyses of the genetically modified offspring. While the proximal goal of this application is to
develop a valuable NHP model to facilitate understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of autism, a
long-term goal is to establish infrastructure to enable the generation of genetically modified monkeys for
translational biomedical research more globally - which we believe to be in the national interest."

 The Overarching Aim of the Northwestern HeartShare DeCODE-HF: Data translation center to Combine
Omics, Deep phenotyping, and Electronic health records for Heart Failure subtypes and treatment
targets is to provide overall management and oversight for HeartShare, including coordination and
communication across all subsections and cores of the program, and with the 4 HeartShare Clinical Centers
(CCs). The Data Translation Center (DTC) will need to ensure timely completion of the retrospective and
prospective components of HeartShare. In our application, we demonstrate the ability and prior experience of
our multi-PI team and core leaders in the conduct and leadership of large-scale, multi-center studies, particularly
in the realms of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), electronic health record (EHR)-based
investigation, deep phenotyping, machine learning, and biorepositories. For both the retrospective and
prospective HeartShare components, the Northwestern DTC will leverage its considerable experience in: (1)
cohorts and trials that have data on adjudicated HF patients, and (2) its leadership and track record as the top
enroller in HFpEF trials/studies to ensure optimal recruitment by the HeartShare CCs. We will also leverage our
expertise in HFpEF, data coordination/management, BioData Catalyst, EHR-based research, biostatistics,
machine learning, multi-omics, human-computer interaction, and mobile health data monitoring to (1)
successfully execute the HeartShare program and (2) meet the HeartShare DTC goals of providing a rich
resource to the research community to advance the science of next-generation phenomics to identify HFpEF
subtypes and therapeutic targets. Our HeartShare DTC will carry out each of its 4 primary responsibilities. (1)
The Administrative and Outreach Core will oversee HeartShare program operations, research skills
development, and capitation to CCs for deep phenotyping costs; support a call center to follow patient outcomes;
and promote rapid and broad data-sharing of clinical and molecular data. (2) The Data Portal Core will serve as
the primary access point (via a web-based interface) and coordinating center for all HeartShare data; and to
develop an interactive patient-facing web-based interface for remote consent, completion of forms, and collection
of mobile health data using BioData Catalyst tools. (3) The Data Management Core will oversee ensure data
quality, integration and harmonization of various data types; perform advanced analytics; coordinate
biospecimen and imaging biorepositories; and integrate with TOPMed for omics analyses. (4) The Cohort Core
will aggregate data on HF patients from completed epidemiology cohorts and HF trials and will combine data
with further bioprofiling of existing samples to allow discovery/validation of novel targets."

10491783,"Justification: High inpatient readmissions among Veterans with SUDs constitutes a costly and persistent
healthcare problem. VHA Handbook 1160.06 guides the development and implementation of recovery-oriented
mental health (MH) services, although significant service gaps remain on VA inpatient settings. âCombined
Recovery Program (CRP)â is designed to address these gaps by enhancing stabilization of Veterans with SUDs
beyond hospital discharge and consists of âGroup Motivational Interviewingâ, an adaptation of motivational
interviewing; and âLife Skills for Housing Maintenanceâ, involving skills training for enhancing housing stability.
To be added to CRP, Stable & Able (S&A) is a VA Home Telehealth (HT) nurse-monitored program providing
assessment and self-management skills in the post-hospitalization phase.
Gaps Addressed: This proposal addresses VA research priorities: access to care and MH, benefitting Veterans
with SUDs. A significant proportion of these Veterans exhibit homelessness and suicidality. Study objectives
address SAIL MH Composite measures âPDE1â to increase Post-Discharge Treatment Engagement in MH care;
and âHRF7â to increase care processes for Veterans at high risk for suicide. During the COVID-19 pandemic,
telehealth solutions offer safe treatment options as well as reduce isolation.
Innovativeness: This proposal is consistent with 2018 MISSION Act in priority areas: mental illness, SUD, and
housing instability via a technology-enabled format and through addressing gaps in the current inpatient recovery
model involving limited availability of staff training in and availability of recovery-oriented services. CRP and S&A
present innovative/novel interventions ready for deployment. Both CRP and S&A were designed specifically to
assist high risk Veterans with SUDs to remain stably housed. S&A is conveniently provided via App using an
iPad, cell phone, or the Medtronic Commander Flex and allows 3 mos. of daily monitoring by trained HT staff.

10761794,"Background: A link between tissue iron and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been
demonstrated across several diverse populations, usually as a relationship between diabetes prevalence and
serum levels of ferritin, a marker of tissue iron. Importantly, risk increases through the entire range of normal
ferritin. There is convincing evidence of beneficial effects of reducing iron in pathologic iron overload such as
that seen in hereditary hemochromatosis or beta thalassemia, but the data in typical T2DM and in the normal
ranges of ferritin are less clear-cut. We have demonstrated a benefit of dietary iron reduction in several mouse
models of diabetes, and present data from a pilot trial in humans that also shows improvement of glycemia with
phlebotomy. Dose responsiveness and time course of that benefit, however, are not known. Up to 60% of
people with T2DM also have fatty liver, a condition that can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
and cirrhosis, liver failure and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. Like diabetes, NASH and ferritin are also
associated, but the same questions of causality and reversibility have not been convincingly resolved.
 Hypothesis: We hypothesize that iron contributes to the pathogenesis and progression of T2DM and
NASH, and that individuals with tissue iron levels, as reflected by serum ferritin, in the upper ranges of normal
will benefit from reducing iron by phlebotomy to levels in the lower ranges of normal. The benefit will be
manifest by improvements in glycemia resulting from improvements in both insulin sensitivity and insulin
secretory capacity, and decreases in indices of liver damage and inflammation in those individuals with NASH.
 Specific Aims: We propose a randomized, placebo-controlled trial at Wake Forest and UNC Chapel
Hill to determine if there is a beneficial effect of iron reduction by phlebotomy on T2DM, prediabetes, and
presumed NASH. We will test if iron reduction will improve: (1) Glycemia, with a primary outcome of
improvement in HgbA1C 6 months after phlebotomy, and as secondary outcomes other measures of glycemia
and Metabolic Syndrome; (2) Clinical indices of presumed NASH, primarily serum transaminases 12 months
after phlebotomy, and also liver stiffness by elastography, and; (3) Insulin sensitivity and/or secretory capacity.
 Clinical impact: If positive effects could be demonstrated in a large and diverse cohort, with better
definition of dose-responsiveness and treatment thresholds, this would define a range of optimal serum ferritin
much narrower that the broad range of normal and justify widespread adoption of a simple, safe, inexpensive,
and acceptable treatment modality (blood donation) for T2DM, prediabetes, and NASH in the large fraction of
the population with body iron stores in the higher range of normal."
10622507,"Project Summary/Abstract
Preclinical radiobiology experiments on small animals are crucial to test the safety and efficacy before human
clinical trials. However, limited by currently available technologies, preclinical animal studies substantially differ
from state-of-the-art human treatments in dose conformity. Consequently, the animal studies poorly mimic the
radiobiological, radioimmunological, and toxicity environment of human therapies. The disparity adversely affects
our ability to meaningfully test hypotheses that are intended for human translation. With decades of
advancement, human radiotherapy has achieved high targeting accuracy and dose conformality based on
technological breakthroughs, including intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), which is unavailable for mouse
experiments. A practical device and algorithm to modulate the x-ray intensity for the scale of small animals is the
first step to bridge the gap. With the support of an NIH R21 grant, we engineered a novel small animal IMRT
dose modulator termed sparse orthogonal collimator (SOC). Equally important as the hardware, we created the
enabling mathematical tools to deliver SOC IMRT plans with higher achievable resolution than a theoretically
miniaturized MLC-based IMRT. We commissioned and tested prototypical SOCs to deliver highly modulated
doses in silico and on phantoms. Nonetheless, there are still large gaps between an intensity modulation device
and a small animal IMRT system suitable for broad adoption and impact. The required time, resources, and
training to create sophisticated SOC-IMRT plans are incompatible with preclinical settings. Furthermore, without
automation, the existing image-guided small animal IMRT treatment is prohibitively slow for treating live animals
under anesthesia. Lastly, the current manual method to switch between imaging and therapy modes results in
intractable uncertainties in dose delivery. We propose to fill these gaps using automation, robotics, and system
optimization. We propose the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1 (SA1). Automated organ segmentation for
mice using deep learning neural networks. Specific Aim 2 (SA2). Development of a fully functional, automated,
and efficient IMRT system. Specific Aim 3 (SA3). Development and validation of a robotic Multi Mouse Automated
Treatment Environment (Multi-MATE) for automated imaging and treatment. Besides dosimetry, we will quantify
the time performance, which is critical to small animal IMRT system. As a result, in addition to improving the
hardware accuracy and reliability, the proposed project will provide a fully automated planning and delivery
system, thus removing the last barriers towards the broad adoption of small animal IMRT. The success of the
proposed project will help existing research to achieve the full potential for human translation and enable future
hypotheses testing where accurate complex dose distribution is critical."
10553596,"Herpesviruses are human pathogens that cause life-long persistent infections and result in clinical manifestations that range from a mild cold sore to cancer. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is among the most frequently encountered virus by the general population. Infection with HSV-1 often results in orolabial disease but it can also cause ocular disease (keratitis) that can lead to blindness or encephalitis, which can be fatal. Type-2 infections are characterized by genital ulcerative disease and infections of the newborn. Thus, infections due to HSV are a major public health concern and understanding the biology of this virus is important in the development of efficacious treatments of these infections. The HSV-1 virion is comprised of four structural elements: a large double-stranded DNA molecule in the central core; an icosahedral capsid, which encloses the genome; a layer that immediately surrounds the capsid termed the tegument; and an outer membrane or envelope, which encloses the whole structure and in which are embedded the viral glycoproteins The tegument is one of the most complex and diverse structures of the virion, both in terms of protein composition and the functions encoded by the constituents of this structure. Of this large and diverse group of virion proteins, not all are classified as being essential for replication in a laboratory cell culture system. What are the functions of all the ânon-essentialâ proteins for virion maturation and egress? These âaccessoryâ gene products likely play important roles in the infected host but an in-depth discovery of their functions has not been accomplished in a comprehensive manner. Using a genome assembly line coupled with synthetic genomics methods, we can elucidate the functions of these proteins by creating âsynthetic lethalityâ in a mutant virus. Our working hypothesis posits that by phenotypic investigation of synthetic lethals, we can then begin to formulate pathways in which these âredundantâ virion proteins participate, as well as, their spatial/temporal roles during HSV-1 virion morphogenesis. The outcome of the proposed studies is expected to further our understanding of the roles of these multitude virion proteins and the importance of their interactions for infectious particle formation. The Specific Aims proposed to achieve these goals are: Specific Aim 1: Genetic interaction networks of the conserved tegument genes: Pivotal role of pUL21. Specific Aim 2: Elucidate the phenotypes of âsynthetic lethalsâ that are centered around the abundant tegument protein, VP22 to determine pathways that lead to virus maturation and envelopment."

As necessary, UCCC leadership will modify the course to adjust to unexpected challenges (e.g., COVID) and
opportunities (e.g., campus-wide initiative to build data science)."
10539265,"Neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) resulting from spinal cord injury or disorder (SCI/D) affects 80% of
individuals with SCI/D. It is also associated with peripheral neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinsonâs
disease, multiple sclerosis, diabetic neuropathy, or stroke. NDO causes urinary incontinence that profoundly
impacts dignified, independent living, associates with numerous comorbidities and fall risk, and is a leading
factor in functional decline among the elderly. Urinary incontinence contributes to social isolation and clinical
depression and associates with military service and post-traumatic stress disorder in Veterans.
 Restoring urine storage is consistently cited as a high priority by individuals with NDO. Continuous SNM is
an off-label treatment, which is effective for some individuals with NDO. Triggered sacral neuromodulationâin
which SNM is applied only during the portion of the bladder fill cycle where NDO occursâcould show unique
benefit in treatment in some individuals. While triggered SNM increased bladder capacity in sheep and rats,
feasibility has not yet been demonstrated in humans with NDO.
 The primary goal of this research is to demonstrate the feasibility of increasing bladder capacity and
reducing bladder filling pressures using triggered SNM in Veterans with NDO. This will expand on unique
technologies developed by our team: the UroMonitor, the Context-Aware Threshold (CAT) algorithm, and the
Application Specific Control Unit (ASCU). The UroMonitor is a small, transurethrally-inserted sensor that
wirelessly transmits bladder pressure data. CAT is a wavelet-based algorithm that detects detrusor
contractions from pressure data in real time. The ASCU is a modular neurostimulation platform supporting
wireless communication and custom control software. We will modify and integrate these technologies to
demonstrate the feasibility of automatically triggering SNM in Veterans. A secondary goal is to use the
UroMonitor to determine bladder capacity, detrusor contraction rate, and filling pressures during a
percutaneous SNM evaluation to identify individuals who respond to SNM therapy before a permanent
implantation. Both translational goals will be accomplished through two Specific Aims (SA):
 SA1 will determine the change in bladder response to conditionally-triggered SNM during natural filling
cycles after a two-week sacral neuromodulation evaluation phase in Veterans with NDO. In SA1a we will
integrate a short-range radio and low-power algorithm processor into the ASCU to trigger percutaneous SNM
under algorithm control. In SA1b we will develop and bench-validate a classification algorithm capable of
triggering SNM based on adaptive detection of detrusor contractions. In SA1c we will apply triggered SNM
using data transmitted from the UroMonitor to the ASCU. Triggered SNM will be applied for eight hours at three
timepoints in the two-week percutaneous evaluation phase in eight Veterans. Voided urine volume, time
between voids, and detrusor contraction frequency will be compared to determine change in conditional SNM
response at the two timepoints and compared to baseline. Outcome measures will be measured from validated
questionnaires, catheter-referenced bladder pressures, and collected voided urine.
 SA2 will determine change in bladder capacity, filling pressure, and detrusor contraction frequency during
natural filling cycles throughout a two-week continuous sacral neuromodulation evaluation. In SA2a we will
integrate adaptive antennas into the UroMonitor and develop an insertion tool for men and women. SA2b will
demonstrate the feasibility of using the UroMonitor to characterize NDO symptoms (bladder capacity, filling
pressure, and detrusor contraction rate) over several bladder filling/emptying cycles. Eight Veterans will
receive standard, continuous percutaneous SNM for two weeks. NDO symptoms will be measured using the
UroMonitor before SNM and after one and two weeks of continuous SNM. Accuracy of symptom quantification
will be compared to standard catheter-based testing and validated urinary behavior questionnaires."
10884081,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Alzheimerâs disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases are typified by a robust
microglial-mediated immune response. Genetic studies have demonstrated that many of the
genes that confer altered risk for AD are those involved in the innate immune response and are
expressed primarily in microglia, including phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCG2). PLCG2 is a
critical signaling element for a variety of immune receptors and is a key regulatory hub gene for
immune signaling. The primary objective of this proposal is to determine the role of PLCG2 in AD
pathogenesis. GWAS studies have demonstrated that the PLCG2 P522R variant is associated
with reduced AD risk. Our laboratory has identified a novel SNP (rs617749044) associated with
elevated AD risk encoding the PLCG2 M28L variant. The overall objectives in this application are
to elucidate the effect of these PLCG2 variants on AD pathogenesis using rodent models of AD
and dissect the molecular mechanisms by which PLCG2 variants alter microglia function. The
hypotheses are that the M28L variant is a loss of function allele, and conversely the P522R is
protective with respect to AD pathogenesis in our murine models. The experiments proposed in
this application are entirely novel and allow, for the first time, a unique, comprehensive analysis
of an AD risk gene whose genetic variants confer both protection and risk for AD. Preliminary data
generated by the applicant suggests that in a rodent model of AD, the M28L variant had
accelerated and exacerbated disease related pathology and conversely the P522R variant
appeared to attenuate disease severity and progression. The hypotheses will be tested by
pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine AD-related phenotypes altered by loss and gain of
function PLCG2 variants in an amyloidogenic model of AD; 2) Identify molecular signatures and
pathways in microglia that are associated with protective or risk PLCG2 variants in an
amyloidogenic model of AD; and 3) Evaluate the mechanisms through which PLCG2 variants
affect intracellular signaling in microglia. These studies are essential prerequisites for the
development of PLCG2-directed therapeutics."
10758187,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Staphylococcus aureus is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality due to a remarkable capacity to
colonize multiple host tissues. Consistent with this, S. aureus is the leading cause of skin and soft tissue
infections, bacteremia, osteomyelitis and endocarditis. Treating infections can be exceedingly challenging due
to the prevalence of antibiotic resistant isolates, which necessitate the development of new therapeutic
strategies. To proliferate within diverse tissues, S. aureus acquires essential nutrients by exploiting abundant
nutrient reservoirs present in the host environment. S. aureus nutrient iron acquisition strategies have been
studied for decades; however, the mechanisms employed by this pathogen to obtain the equally important
nutrient sulfur during infection are not known. Reduced and oxidized forms of the sulfur-containing molecules,
glutathione and cysteine, are abundant in host tissues and support in vitro proliferation of S. aureus. Whether
these molecules satisfy the sulfur requirement during pathogenesis is unresolved, because we do not understand
how S. aureus imports and catabolizes these molecules. To elucidate the mechanisms S. aureus employs to
acquire host-derived glutathione, we completed a forward genetic screen and identified mutants that fail to grow
in medium supplemented with glutathione as the sole source of sulfur. A reverse genetic approach was pursued
to identify potential cysteine transporters. We constructed mutants inactivated for homologues of putative
oxidized cysteine transporters and show that the mutated strains are impaired for oxidized cysteine utilization in
vitro. Notably, one of the importers provides a competitive advantage in liver colonization in a murine model of
systemic infection. These preliminary data represent identification of the first S. aureus sulfur acquisition systems
and support the hypothesis that during infection, S. aureus targets abundant host-derived sulfur-containing
molecules to satisfy the sulfur requirement. The proposed work will test this hypothesis by (i) establishing the
mechanisms that support S. aureus import and catabolism of host-derived GSH, (ii) identifying S. aureus reduced
and oxidized cysteine acquisition strategies during infection, and (iii) determining sulfur source abundance and
distribution at the host-pathogen interface. Understanding how the host immune response to infection impacts
sulfur source availability in tissues is also a goal of this study. The completion of this work will reveal the
mechanisms S. aureus employs to acquire host-derived sulfur sources during colonization of distinct tissues.
This work will provide novel therapeutic strategies to combat antibiotic resistant S. aureus by impeding nutrient
sulfur acquisition. We predict that S. aureus sulfur source acquisition strategies are likely conserved in other
bacterial pathogens, broadening the scope and impact of the proposed work."

The Cyclin D-Cdk4/6-Rb-E2F pathway integrates external and internal signals to control cell cycle progression
at the G1/S transition of the cell cycle. Alterations in the Cyclin D-Cdk4/6-Rb-E2F pathway are found in the vast
majority of human cancers. These alterations are thought to increase the proliferative potential of cancer cells.
For example, the functional inactivation of the retinoblastoma (RB1) tumor suppressor or the amplification of
Cyclin D genes is a recurrent event in the development of a wide range of human cancers. In the simple
consensus model, the retinoblastoma protein Rb inhibits cell proliferation at the G1/S transition of the cell cycle
by binding and inhibiting E2F transcription factors. In response to cell growth and proliferative signals, Rb is
phosphorylated and inactivated in normal cells by a series of Cyclin-dependent kinase complexes (first Cyclin
D-Cdk4/6 and then Cyclin E/A-Cdk2). Phosphorylation of Rb results in the dissociation of Rb from E2F
transcription factors thereby causing transcription of genes important for DNA synthesis and other key aspects
of cell cycle progression. Thus, cancer cells with constitutively inactive Rb are thought to acquire an increased
proliferative potential. Knowledge of the Cyclin D-Cdk4/6-Rb-E2F pathway in normal and cancer cells has led to
the development of specific Cdk4/6 inhibitors that have been approved for the treatment of breast cancer and
are in clinical trials for several other cancer types. In this paradigm, inhibition of Cdk4/6 results in decreased Rb
phosphorylation, which activates Rbâs cell cycle inhibitory function. However, many tumors do not respond to
these inhibitors or do so only transiently. Recent observations in patients and pre-clinical models indicate that
our understanding of the Rb pathway is not as complete as we previously thought. This may explain the variable
results of Cdk4/6 inhibitors in the clinic. The overall goal of this proposal is to gain a deeper structural, molecular,
and cellular understanding of the Rb pathway with the ultimate goal to help design new and improved therapeutic
strategies targeting this pathway in a broad range of cancer patients. Our first goal is to determine the core
mechanisms regulating the Cyclin D-Cdk4/6-Rb-E2F pathway, including how Cyclin D-Cdk4/6 phosphorylates
Rb and how previously unknown post-translational modifications regulate Rb and E2F activities. Our second
goal is to identify and investigate new functions of Rb pathway components, including new targets of Cyclin D-
Cdk4/6 kinases, new functions for Rb and its family members p107 and p130, and new regulatory mechanisms
controlling the concentration and activity of E2F transcription factors. Our third goal is to initiate the development
of strategies that target the Rb pathway in innovative ways, including molecules that inhibit Cyclin D-Rb
association, stimulate the tumor suppressor activity of p107 and p130, and manipulate E2F stability. These goals
will be achieved in three inter-related Projects via a comprehensive, synergistic and multi-disciplinary approach.
Ultimately, the information gained from these studies may provide new ways to target the Cyclin D-Cdk4/6-Rb-
E2F pathway to improve cancer therapy."

10848180,"We recently demonstrated that a critical infant adaptive social behavior -- looking into the eyes of an engaging
caregiver -- obeys a fundamental biological principle of âentrainmentâ: Infant eye-looking entrains (or becomes
time-locked) to the rhythmic social cueing of a caregiver during social musical interactions of infant-directed
singing. Equally importantly, caregivers structure their own child-directed behavior to enhance this rhythmic cuing
and facilitate the delivery and receipt of meaningful social information. These results inform basic mechanisms
of typical social development as well as disruptions in social development in children with ASD. A common and
lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder, individuals with ASD exhibit impairments in social and communicative
functioning that require specialized support. In pilot data for the current proposal, we observe that toddlers with
ASD show attenuated, though present, rhythmic entrainment to predictable child-directed singing. The current
project builds upon our findings of rhythmic social entrainment during infancy to advance mechanistic
understanding of rhythmic entrainment in social development in typically developing toddlers and those with
ASD, as well as propose rhythmic entrainment as an active ingredient of music-based interventions for social
communication in toddlers with ASD. In the R61, we first quantify the effects of rhythmic entrainment to child-
directed singing in toddlers with and without ASD (R61 Aim 1) and examine predictability as a driver of this
entrainment (R61 Aim 2). Successfully establishing rhythmic entrainment during predictable social musical
engagement (Go/No-Go criteria) will provide strong evidence of a potential fundamental role of rhythm sensitivity
in social entrainment. In the R33, we measure the extent to which individual levels of rhythmic entrainment in
ASD are mechanistic predictors of response to music-enhanced and standard evidence-based naturalistic
developmental behavioral interventions for ASD (R33 Aim 3). Establishing malleability in social rhythm sensitivity
is a crucial step for identifying potential mechanisms of change for future investigations of music-based
treatments for functional social communication outcomes in ASD. In alignment with RFA-AT-19-001, Promoting
Research on Music and Health, this project will facilitate rigorous studies of child health and development and
musical interventions. Through examination of the principles of social entrainment afforded by natural social
musical interactions, this research has implications for basic mechanisms of disrupted interpersonal synchrony
in ASD, while also identifying potential targets of active engagement for the development of music-based
interventions."

Single stranded DNA (ssDNA) has been demonstrated to by extremely vulnerable to DNA damage. Cancers
often carry long stretches of clustered mutations that likely arose due to damage of ssDNA. While, various
studies have demonstrated that certain mutagens preferentially damage ssDNA, the mechanisms that alter
mutation specificity due to damage in ssDNA and the pathways that prevent mutagenesis at ssDNA are
unknown. The overarching goal of this proposal is to specifically identify the roles of DNA damage checkpoint
proteins, translesion polymerases, ssDNA-specific glycosylases and ssDNA binding proteins in altering the
mutation patterns obtained upon ssDNA-specific damage. My laboratory is in a unique position to advance this
scientific front based on my strong track record in DNA damage and repair, assembled team of collaborators,
and multidisciplinary approach. My expertise in using highly sensitive yeast reporter systems, human cell
culture techniques and the use of bioinformatics tools to probe large data sets and to analyze next generation
sequencing data allow us to develop our research program to understand the pathways modulating ssDNA
mutagenesis in yeast and human cells. Previously, I have demonstrated that alkylating agents and
acetaldehyde have an ssDNA-specific mutation signature in yeast and in cancers. These mutation signatures
provide us with a highly sensitive tool to determine how changes in various DNA repair, damage bypass and
damage sensing pathways alter mutagenesis by ssDNA-specific mutagens. Here, we propose to determine 1)
How cell cycle dependent translesion polymerase expression alters mutation signatures in ssDNA; 2) The role
of ssDNA binding Replication Protein A complex in protecting ssDNA from exogenous damage; 3) The role of
DNA damage checkpoint activation in modulating the mutation signatures associated with ssDNA damage; 4)
Which DNA glycosylases function on ssDNA and alter the mutation signatures due to ssDNA damage; and 5)
What are the mutagenic outcomes when translesion polymerases are unable to bypass ssDNA damage. This
set of research projects will address a key gap in knowledge in understanding the mechanisms that alter the
hypermutability of ssDNA in cells. Our work will enable us to identify and develop better cancer preventative
measures for individuals who are prone to increased genome instability and ssDNA formation in their cells."

For this reason, it has hosted, for the last five years, the JJ Vance Memorial Summer Internship in Biological and Computational Sciences (JJ Vance internship), a program that has offered rising seniors from Miami-area high schools a unique opportunity to be directly involved in scientific research. The program has been highly successful, receiving a total of 541 applications during the 5-year funding period from 94 different high schools in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties, for only 12-13 positions per year. Of the 63 selected interns during this time, 47% were Hispanic/Latino, 15% were African American, 30% were white non-Hispanic and 8% were Asian. Ninety-seven percent (97%) of students that have graduated from high school (two classes are still in high school) have attended college, and STEM majors represent 87% of the ex-internsâ college major fields of study with 20% currently attending additional graduate study. The programsâ design incorporates the student into ongoing working research groups led by faculty members at the HIHG, focusing on a hands-on and mentoring experience. We strive to create a passion for science, for research; to enable the student to experience not only the creativity of science but understand what career steps it takes to get them there. We offer both laboratory as well as a computer-based (bioinformatics, statistical genetics, data- management programming) experience."

across all age-groups but because appropriate microbiologic diagnostic services are non-
existent or very limited, ascertaining the specific etiologic agents and the true prevalence of
antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major challenge in Africa, where objective data is limited.
Preliminary observations from Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa include the
following; a) High prevalence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) with 45%
prevalence of multidrug resistance, b) High prevalence of Extended Spectrum Î²-Lactamase-
producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) blood stream infections, c) Maternal colonization by
ESBL-E in women at delivery is associated with high all-cause morbidity and mortality in their
newborn babies compared to ESBL-unexposed babies and d) Periodic outbreaks of
carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae sepsis in newborn units with case fatality rates as
high as 45%. We have preliminary molecular characterization of about 500 of the 2,750 diverse
bloodstream bacterial isolates in our collection. In addition, we have access to a collection of
over 2,500 clinical isolates of blood, sputum and urine from our sentinel laboratories in Nigeria
and Rwanda that are partially characterized. Our unique observations related to AMR genes
that we have identified in our archived isolates form the basis for this research proposal. Our
overall strategy in this application focuses on three thematic areas: 1). Comparative
phenotypic and genotypic studies of archived and contemporary clinical isolates to inform trends
in AMR and dynamics of transmission. 2) Incorporation of acute inflammatory markers of
serious bacterial infection and gene products from resistant bacteria into a portable screening
tool for clinical care and 3). Explore the potential benefit of an aminoglycoside (Tobramycin)
conjugated to an antimicrobial peptide for enhanced bactericidal activity against multi-drug

veterinarians, and industrialists to implement this project in Nigeria, West Africa and also
Rwanda, East Africa to provide data with geographic representation for Africa. Upon successful
completion of this program, we would have utilized the data science platform for bacteria
genomics and antimicrobial resistance to raise awareness on the scope of AMR in Africa,
provide novel pathways for optimizing empiric use of antibiotics and trained a handful of young
African scientists in bacterial genomics and bioinformatics."
10846844,"RESEARCH & RELATED - OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In this Program Project renewal application, we propose to fundamentally expand current understanding of the
variable potentially functional modulations of the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors.
During this current period, our work has resulted in the development of a number of key pharmacologically
diverse and selective agonists and antagonists for CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors. We also produced
detailed information on the structures of these two receptors. Based upon the strengths of this foundational work,
we now propose to develop new functionally selective tools for fine tuning CB1 function and for selectively
enhancing CB2 actions in vivo. Our work will generate early candidates for the discovery and development of
new therapeutic medications. In this renewal, we will elucidate the functional selectivity aspect of CB1 agonists
and develop positive allosteric modulators at CB1 that selectively enhance endocannabinoid signaling. We also
propose to develop highly selective CB2 agonists to enable studies of CB2 in vivo while limiting the contributions
of CB1 that have been associated with undesirable side effects. Additionally, we propose to develop ligands
that act as activators of CB2 while also acting as CB1 antagonists. Using such compounds in vivo may lay the
groundwork for the development of medications for inflammatory and fibrotic disorders.
Our goals will be accomplished through the synthesis of druggable analogs. The design of these ligands will be
based on existing structures of the CB1 and CB2 receptors that were developed during the current funding period
and by utilizing computational approaches. The work will require detailed molecular pharmacology aimed at
studying the signaling of novel compounds accompanied by targeted mutations in CB1 and CB2 to confirm
mechanistic underpinnings of pharmacological divergences in signaling. The most efficient novel compounds
will be assayed using in vivo approaches aimed at exploring potential therapeutic value.
The overall project will provide foundational information on cannabinoid receptor signaling and serve as a basis
for the future development of rationally designed, mechanism-based therapeutic medications."
10805373,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the principal basis of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and more than half of
individuals experiencing acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have no premonitory symptoms. Coronary CT
angiography is a non-invasive technique that permits low-dose volumetric imaging of the coronary arteries in a
single heartbeat. CT is accurate compared to invasive angiography, and angiographic severity of coronary artery
disease (CAD) by CT enables prognostication of ACS and death. Beyond luminal narrowing, CT enables
quantitative evaluation of an array of atherosclerotic plaque characteristics (APCs). Further, application of
computational fluid dynamics to CT enables determination of an array of coronary physiologic characteristics
(CPCs), such as fractional flow reserve, endothelial wall shear stress, vorticity, particle resident time, axial plaque
stress and plaque structural stress. To date, among CPCs, only ESSâin studies performed by our groupâhas
been evaluated for its influence on future ACS risk, and was done so in select post-ACS populations of patients
undergoing invasive imaging. Yet, the remainder of CPCs has not been evaluated for their prognostic importance
to ACS risk, and none has been assessed in a stable population without known CAD. Further, combining CPCs
with APCs for improved risk stratification of future ACS remains virtually unexplored.
 The OVERALL HYPOTHESIS of this proposal is that integration of coronary atherosclerosis with
coronary physiologic features will improve identification of stable individuals who will subsequently experience
ACS beyond any coronary feature alone. We propose 3 aims:
 AIM 1. To characterize CPCs associated with future ACS. Hypothesis: CPCs within arteries and exerted
on plaques that will be implicated in future ACS will differ from CPCs within arteries and exerted on plaques that
will not be implicated in future ACS.
 AIM 2. To integrate CPCs with APCs for enhanced identification of stable individuals who will experience
future ACS. Hypothesis: A multi-dimensional framework that integrates the entirety of coronary atherosclerosis
and pathophysiologic features will be superior to frameworks that do not integrate coronary atherosclerosis and
pathophysiologic features for identification of individuals who will experience future ACS.
 AIM 3. To validate the clinical tool developed in Aim 2 in stable individuals with suspected CAD.
Hypothesis: Applied to a general population of stable individuals with suspected but without known CAD enrolled
in the randomized controlled SCOT-HEART trial, a clinical tool that integrates coronary atherosclerosis and
coronary pathophysiologic features will be effective for prediction of ACS.
 If successful, the work in this proposal will provide the rationale for a novel diagnostic and prognostic
paradigm that can be readily applied in clinical care of patients with suspected CAD. Further, this work will offer
unique insights into the pathophysiology of CAD."
10802393,"OVERALL: ABSTRACT
History has taught us that exposures to radionuclides can happen any day almost anywhere in the US and
elsewhere and we have done little to prepare ourselves. Our ability to perform dosimetry modeling for such
scenarios and efforts into biomarker and mitigation discovery are archaic and our tendency to rely on external
beam radiation to model these is utterly misplaced. We should and we can do much better.
This program centers on the hypothesis that radiation from internal emitters is very unevenly distributed within a
body, amongst organs, and even within organs, tissues and cells. The half-life and decay schema of the
radionuclide, its activity and concentration, particle size and morphology, and its chemical form and solubility are
all critical, as are the route of uptake, tissue structure, genetic makeup, physiology, danger signaling and the
crosstalk with the immune system. Conceptually this suggests that the analysis of radionuclide distribution
requires measurements at the MESO, MICRO and NANO level for accurate dosimetry modeling and biokinetics
analyses, that will much better align with biological endpoints, and therefore with meaningful countermeasure
development. In many ways our program integrates the three main pillars of radiation science, namely radiation
physics, radiation chemistry and radiation biology, taking into account pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
aspects of particle distribution at subcellular, cellular, and tissue levels.
In other words, to understand the biological effects of internal emitters and find the best possible mitigation
strategies a systematic study is called for, one that includes but is not limited to: a) radionuclide physical and
chemical form and intravital migration, b) protracted exposure times, c) radiation quality parameters, d) novel
virtual phantom modeling beyond few MACRO reference models ; e) novel biokinetics with sex- and age-
specificity; f) MESO, MICRO and NANO scale histology and immunohistochemistry with integrated radionuclide
distribution information; g) exploration of molecular biomarkers of radionuclide intake and contamination and h)
countermeasures that modulate radionuclide distribution and possibly also improve DNA, cell and tissue repair.
We have assembled a team with diverse scientific expertise that can tackle these challenges within an integrated
program. There is an incredibly impressive technological toolbox at our disposal and our goal is to generate a
meaningful blueprint for understanding and predicting biological consequences of exposure to radionuclides.
The possible benefits of this program to the radiation research community and the general population are

10764188,"Project Summary: Natural Killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system. NK cells defend us
by inducing antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) where NK cells lyse antibody coated virally-
infected target cells. Recent experiments showed generation of long-lived âmemory-likeâ NK cells, similar to
memory lymphocytes in the adaptive immune system, in mouse and humans challenged by viral infections
(such as cytomegalovirus). These memory NK cells generated a more vigorous ADCC response compared to
their naÃ¯ve counterparts which make the memory NK cells an attractive candidate for augmenting monoclonal
antibody based immunotherapies against cancer and infectious disease. However, two major issues limit the
use of âmemory-likeâ NK cells for such therapies: 1) A rudimentary understanding of mechanisms underlying
NK cell-mediated ADCC is lacking; and 2) humans and mice show key differences in the NK cell signaling
networks, which regulate ADCC. We address the above challenges by developing computational models with
predictive powers for antibody responses induced by NK cell subsets (from naÃ¯ve to memory) in humans and
mice by synergistically combining data-driven and mechanistic in silico models (rooted in statistical physics,
nonlinear dynamics, information theory, statistics, and chemical engineering) with single cell mass cytometry
by time of flight (CyTOF) and state-of-the-art wet lab experiments in primary NK cells obtained from human
subjects and genetically modified mice. The objective of the proposal is to quantitatively characterize
mechanisms underlying ADCC in diverse NK cell subsets in humans and mice and then use this quantitative
understanding to develop novel mouse models of ADCC that reflect the situation in humans more accurately.
We will pursue two aims: Aim 1: Modeling ADCC activity in human naÃ¯ve and memory NK cell subsets. Aim 2:
Modeling ADCC in mouse NK cells. The expected outcome of quantitative characterization of the differences
and synergies in mechanisms of ADCC induced by CD16 and CD32 receptors in different NK cell subsets
(naÃ¯ve to memory primary NK cells) (Aim 1) will help us generate improved mouse models that more accurately
represent ADCC mediated by human NK cells (Aim 2). This unique framework will provide the scientific
community with a mouse model for ADCC that more accurately reflects the situation in humans, a critical asset
for pre-clinical development of monoclonal antibody therapeutics for cancer and infectious diseases."

10813783,"OVERALL: PROJECT SUMMARY
As a National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Designated Cancer Center for the past 45 years, Wake Forest Baptist
Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) has been a leader in basic, translational, clinical, and population-
based cancer research. WFBCCC addresses the significant cancer burden within a 58-county region,
predominantly rural Appalachian regions within central and western North Carolina, southwestern Virginia, and
southern West Virginia. The WFBCCC Director Boris Pasche, MD, PhD and his leadership team have built a
robust, transdisciplinary center that includes 140 scientists. Innovative, high-impact research is driven by
WFBCCCâs four research Programs: Cancer Prevention and Control, Cancer Genetics and Metabolism,
Signaling and Biotechnology, and Neuro-Oncology. The rapid pace of discovery and movement toward effective
translational research is supported by nine Shared Resources. WFBCCC successfully leverages its NCI-
Designated Cancer Center status to harness, expand, and improve the Centerâs research capabilities to
decrease the cancer burden throughout its catchment area. Through its three-decade history as a research base
for the NCIâs Community Clinical Oncology Research Program, WFBCCC is one of the nationâs leading
institutions driving innovative cancer control and cancer care delivery interventions across the US. During the
current project period, WFBCCC invested in the recruitment of 47 new cancer-focused faculty contributing to an
annual base of cancer-relevant, peer-reviewed research of $29.4M (excluding training and career development
awards), of which $16.5M is from the NCI. These are 49% and 57% increases, respectively, from the previous
renewal. In addition, accrual to all interventional trials has increased more than 5-fold this project period. In 2020,
the Center recruited 12,507 individuals to cancer-focused interventional studies, the highest annual recruitment
to interventional studies in the history of WFBCCC. In addition, WFBCCC has made significant progress in
recruiting racial/ethnic minorities and individuals residing in rural communities to participate in research. In 2020,
23.2% of all interventional clinical trial participants were racial/ethnic minorities, and nearly 23% of all individuals
recruited were from rural communities federally designated as medically underserved. This success is a result
of many years of progressive, WFBCCC-led community outreach, engagement, and education, which continue
within the WFBCCC Office of Cancer Health Equity. Also committed to training the next generation of diverse
cancer physicians and biomedical and biobehavioral scientists, the WFBCCC has developed a comprehensive
cancer education and training pipeline for learners across the entire educational continuum. Going forward, the
WFBCCC will be guided by its 2021-2026 Strategic Plan â developed from thoughtful internal and external
evaluations incorporating scientific and community perspectives â to ensure WFBCCC continues to advance
scientific discovery, make impactful contributions to the understanding of cancer biology and behavioral health
within a diverse population, and translate these discoveries into transformative approaches to cancer care."
10620617,"Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) impacts quality of life causing disability in up to 1% of the population
and 2% of those 60 and older. Men with RA have twice the risk of death as the general population, in part due
to higher disease activity. Despite advances in treatment options and strategies, disparities in outcomes by
race/ethnicity persist. Treatment decisions after failure with first-line methotrexate are complex, involve trade-
offs in terms of harm, and require individualized decisions. In shared decision making (SDM), patients and
clinicians work together to identify how to best address the patientâs situation. SDM has been proposed as a
way to reduce disparities, but uptake is suboptimal and no effective tools or trainings to foster SDM in a
systematic, uniform way across VA exist.
Significance/Impact: Veterans with RA are disproportionately male, have greater number of comorbidities,
and higher mortality. SDM is the first principal of the RA treat to target guidelines but significant gaps in
knowledge of effective interventions to support SDM exist â particularly in VA. This proposal to test the
effectiveness of a novel, multicomponent SDM intervention is responsive to three VA HSR&D priority domains:
1) health care value (SDM is associated with reducing overuse), 2) quality of health care, and 3) health equity.
Innovation: Treatment studies in RA have focused primarily on white women, while men, who represent the
VA RA population, have poorer outcomes. Targeting this large subgroup to evaluate the impact of an SDM
intervention on disease outcomes and adherence is novel. Use of a novel approach combining clinician
training and a decision aid to recognize the unique needs of Veterans with RA is innovative.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-component SDM intervention (clinician training,
patient activation, RA Choice decision aid) in a stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized controlled trial on
improvement in disease activity, RA knowledge, and adherence. Hypothesis 1: During SDM intervention
phases, Veterans will have lower disease activity compared to during control periods and will be more likely to
experience a minimally clinically important difference in a standard disease activity index. Hypothesis 2:
Veterans will have higher RA knowledge and better adherence after being exposed to the intervention.
Exploratory Hypothesis: The SDM intervention will have greater effect in likelihood of lowering disease activity
among racial/ethnic minorities and Veterans with limited health literacy. Aim 2: Evaluate the effectiveness of a
multi-component intervention to facilitate SDM. Hypothesis: An SDM intervention for Veterans with RA will
result in higher uptake of SDM in enrolled clinics during the intervention phase, relative to control phase. Aim 3:
Conduct a qualitative evaluation of the SDM intervention and local implementation to inform future
dissemination.
Methodology: A stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized controlled trial design will be used to evaluate the
effectiveness of a novel SDM intervention across three sites. Participants: Veterans with RA and rheumatology
clinicians; Intervention: multicomponent SDM intervention (clinician training, patient activation prompts,
decision aid); Control: participants at each site during the pre-intervention period will serve as controls;
Outcomes: RA disease activity; patient-reported measures of adherence, knowledge, SDM, and an objective
measure of SDM. Time: pre-intervention, intervention, and post-intervention phases for each step, measures
collected over 42 months.
Implementation/Next Steps: The proposed effectiveness study led by an experienced, transdisciplinary team
of SDM and VA health services researchers has the potential to speed the translation of SDM research within
VA and beyond, through collaboration with operational partners in VISN 20 and VA subspecialists nationally to
improve quality of care for all persons with RA."
10549822,"The establishment of functional neuronal networks in the developing and adult central nervous system (CNS)
requires proper axonal specification, growth, branching, targeting, and synaptogenesis. Failure to appropriately
interconnect brain regions during development or to refine those connections during maturation can lead to
neurodevelopmental disabilities, such as autism, or to neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. De novo
mutations in ANK2, which encodes ankyrin-B (AnkB), have been identified in autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
patients, some of whom show aberrant axonal development. Neuronal loss of AnkB isoforms in mice results in
absence of long axonal projections in the CNS and an overall reduction in axonal length, confirming that AnkB
serves important roles in neuronal development in both humans and mice.
AnkB has two major isoforms in the brain; ubiquitously expressed 220kDa (AnkB220) and neuron-specific
440kDa AnkB (AnkB440). We recently discovered that AnkB220 is motile and promotes microtubule-based
axonal transport in cultured neurons to facilitate axonal growth. In contrast, AnkB440 interacts with cell adhesion
molecules implicated in axon guidance and synaptogenesis. Neurons lacking AnkB440 have increased axon
branching and synaptogenesis. We also found that AnkB is enriched at the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic
synapses. The different phenotypes of the isoform-specific knockout in mice highlights the specialized functions
of AnkB220 and AnkB440. Thus, there is a need to uncover the functional roles of neuronal AnkB and discern
the cellular specialization of its AnkB220 and AnkB440 isoforms.
Here, we will use novel mouse models lacking AnkB220 or AnkB440 in cortical neurons to unravel the precise
cellular mechanisms underlying the neuronal development and connectivity deficits caused by the loss of these
isoforms. Our research constitutes a novel effort to test our central hypothesis that AnkB coordinates neuronal
structural and functional connectivity through the combined and specific roles of the AnkB220 and AnkB440
isoforms. To achieve our goals, we aim to: (1) Determine if AnkB220-driven axonal transport is required for the
development and maintenance of long-range CNS axons in vivo; (2) Define molecular interactions required for
AnkB440-mediated regulation of synaptic connections during brain development; and (3) Define the roles of
AnkB in the postsynapse. Our studies will directly contribute to our understanding of the fundamental
mechanisms of axonal growth and synaptogenesis, thereby informing the pathophysiology of ankyrin-related
neurological and other brain disorders associated with deficits in white matter and synaptic connectivity."
10862540,"Overall Abstract
Our PPG will test the hypothesis that the lipid and protein components of lipoproteins trigger innate and
adaptive immune responses that control human atherosclerosis. We will study the immune cell cross-talk that
occurs during human atherosclerosis progression. Immunity plays an important role in coronary artery disease
(CAD), as recent clinical trials have clearly demonstrated. However, these trials also taught us that systemic
treatments of the immune system, by their very nature, impair host defense. Thus, it is imperative to find new,
more specific interventions that modulate immune cell function in atherosclerosis, yet spare host defense. We
will study immune cells and plasma from human subjects from 3 well-characterized clinical cohorts, 1-our
existing CAVA cohort (Coronary Assessment at Virginia), where subjects are enrolled from the UVA cardiac
catheterization laboratory that undergo quantitative coronary analysis for disease quantification; 2-
Computerized Tomography (CT)-CAVA cohort, where subjects undergoing noninvasive CT angiography for
cardiovascular disease assessment in years 1 and 2 of the PPG renewal (baseline measures) will be followed
up at 3 years to allow for determination of coronary plaque progression and changes in markers of plaque
vulnerability, and 3- The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large NHLBI-sponsored
longitudinal cohort that has been ongoing since 2000. In this synergistic program, Project 1 CD9+ Monocyte
and Macrophage Immune Functions in Atherosclerosis has identified new monocyte subsets expressing the
tetraspanin CD9, and will study how CD9 impacts metabolism and immune modulation of monocytes and
macrophages in CAD. Project 2 Cholesterol Regulation of Inflammatory Macrophages in Atherosclerosis will
study how specialized lipid raft signaling drives transcriptional and metabolic reprogramming in macrophages.
Project 3 Regulation of Atheroprotective IgM-producing B cells in Murine and Human Atherosclerosis will study
how CD24 and CCR6 on newly identified human B-1 cell subsets modulate atheroprotective IgM production.
Project 4 ApoB-Specific CD4 and CD8 T cells Exacerbate Atherosclerosis will identify and study
immunodominant human apolipoprotein B (apoB) epitopes to investigate how these activate CD4 and CD8 T
cell using mouse models to address mechanisms. An important synergistic aspect to our PPG is that it is highly
interactive, in that B cells, T cells, monocytes and macrophages communicate with each other in the artery wall
and in lymphoid tissues. Unique aspects of our program are the focus on studying human immune cells, the
link to biospecimens and clinical data from 3 complementary cardiovascular cohorts, the use of unbiased high
dimensional protein and RNA-sequencing at the single cell level for all human immune cells from the same
human subjects, and our ability to link all of our groupâs discoveries with extensive clinical data on each
subject. The human studies are complemented by murine mechanistic models where applicable. The end
goal of our studies is to identify safe new therapeutic strategies targeting immune cell function to limit CAD."

The overarching goal of the Population Councilâs (PC) P50 proposal is to develop an innovative non-hormonal
multipurpose prevention technology (MPT) intravaginal ring (IVR) with the potential to improve the lives of
millions of women globally by combatting the overlapping burdens of unintended pregnancy and sexually
transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. Emerging data indicate that women overwhelmingly prefer products
that prevent pregnancy and STIs/HIV over ones that prevent only pregnancy or only STI/HIVs. Our âCZL-IVRâ is
a user-controlled 30-day IVR containing three active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), copper (C), zinc acetate
(Z), and lactide (L) (a lactic acid prodrug) that together have non-hormonal contraceptive and anti-STI/HIV activity
including chlamydia (CT), gonorrhea (GC), HSV-2, and HIV-1. Lactide maintains optimal vaginal pH and provides
antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-bacterial vaginosis (BV) effects. We will advance development of our CZL-IVR
through implementation of three integrated research projects. In Project 1 we aim to formulate and manufacture
CZL-IVRs that achieve 30-day API delivery, manufacture and characterize in vitro mechanical performance of
IVRs with varying dimensions and polymers with the selection of four candidates with a range of mechanical
characteristics to evaluate in end-user research, and establish Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) production
for non-medicated rings for research conducted in Project 3. In Project 2 we aim to define the optimal API
delivery doses of the three APIs alone and in combination, and to confirm the efficacy and safety of the prototype
CZL-IVR by conducting essential preclinical studies including in-vitro and in-vivo contraceptive efficacy and
antimicrobial efficacy and toxicity studies of APIs and of prototype human-sized and rhesus macaque-sized CZL-
IVRs. In Project 3 we will inform CZL-IVR development and the field more broadly through end-user research
employing novel mixed method approaches including a controlled setting cross-over study of the four selected
candidate non-medicated IVRs of varying mechanical characteristics, a 30-day continuous use study of a non-
medicated prototype IVR with an embedded temperature sensor, and a national cross-sectional survey with a
discrete choice experiment (DCE) and latent class analysis (LCA). The Administrative Core will support and
synergize our interdisciplinary collaborative research, provide scientific, administrative, and operational expertise
and oversight, and manage advisory committees to ensure adherence to timelines and success in achieving our
aims through rigorous science. Our P50 Center will be a hub fostering careers of early stage investigators and
inspiring MPT product development through fellowships and pilot project grants. Drawing from our world-class
Center for Biomedical Research and building on decades of successful contraceptive product development, the
PCâs P50 Center will capitalize on the rich, collaborative, and interdisciplinary environment and the vast
experience of the PC and our partners to advance development of an innovative MPT product."
10883953,"SUMMARY
The continuing saga of anti-Ab antibody aducanumab has produced the first positive phase 3 outcome for
Alzheimer's disease (AD) since memantine was approved in 2003. This promising, albeit controversial, result
has breathed new life into the therapeutic potential for Ab-lowering strategies and legitimized the ongoing
exploration of other means to chronically and safely mitigate Ab. Past work had shown that small peptide
inhibitors can be readily tailored to prevent Ab aggregation, but in vivo delivery of peptide-based drugs was
limited by short half-life and poor brain penetration. We have identified two Ab sequence variants that meet
criteria for potential therapeutic use, as they 1) prevent aggregation of WT Ab in vitro, 2) promote disassembly
of Ab existing fibrils, 3) mitigate toxicity of Ab oligomers, and importantly, 4) do not self-aggregate. To deliver
these peptides in vivo, we have developed a novel mini-gene to express our variant peptides at the plasma
membrane where they are released into the extracellular space by g-secretase cleavage. By packaging this
minigene into an AAV vector that is injected into APP/PS1 mice, our pilot data show that viral expression of
variant Ab lowers Ab load and delays plaque formation. The current proposal will build on these results
through the following specific aims. First, we will decipher the biophysical mechanism of interactions between
variant and wild type AÎ² peptides. We will use analytical methods of CD spectroscopy, SEC chromatography,
EM, and antibody profiling to define the structural mechanism by which our variants prevent/reverse
aggregation of wild-type Ab. Second, we will determine how dosage, timing and route of variant AÎ²
administration influence efficacy in vivo. We will use viral strategies to compare interventional treatment after
amyloid onset with preventative treatment starting at birth, determine the lowest effective ratio of variant:wild-
type Ab needed to modify plaque formation and cognitive function, and test whether delivery through the CSF
can match the effect of neuronal transduction. Third, we will interrogate the neuroimmune reaction to variant
AÎ² as an accomplice to plaque reduction. We will use histological and transcriptional profiling to assess
whether a neuroimmune response to either the variant peptide or its AAV carrier contribute to plaque
prevention in vivo, and if the neuroimmune response changes with age. Finally, we will test the potential for
variant AÎ² to slow AD aggregate seeding. We anticipate that variant Ab will slow seeding by AD Ab extracts,
but will more importantly test whether variant Ab can assuage cross-seeding of tau in amyloid-bearing mice. If
successful, this strategy for self-inhibition may also be applicable to other protein misfolding diseases where
peptide treatments have been eschewed for technical reasons that can now be overcome through
expression engineering and viral technology."
10767765,"Abstract
Congenital heart disease (CHD) affects approximately 1.2% of children and is the leading cause of birth defect-
related deaths. Single ventricle heart disease (SVHD) is a severe form of CHD, with high morbidity and
mortality. These patients require multiple palliative surgeries, culminating with a total cavopulmonary
anastomosis. Despite considerable improvement in the survival of patients with SVHD, there is increasing
morbidity and mortality over time. It remains unclear why some SVHD patients fail their surgical repairs while
others remain relatively well. Clinicians often rely on 2-dimensional (2D) images acquired from
echocardiograms, catheterizations, or cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) exams to assess SVHD
patients and qualitatively choose the optimal surgical repair. The 2D images, however, lead to a suboptimal
understanding of the complex 3D spatial relationships and hemodynamics, and limit efficient decision making.
To address this deficiency, a free-breathing sequence is developed to acquire 3D cine CMR images of the
heart and great vessels in 10 minutes. The 3D block of data will be used to generate a patient-specific pulsatile
heart model. This heart model will be used to simulate the patient cardiovascular system with a lumped-
parameter model. The lumped-parameter model will be used to simulate different surgical repairs and
quantitatively choose the most optimal repair for each patient. We expect that this platform rationalizes
surgeons' decisions for the best surgical approach and improves the survival rate of patients with SVHD."

cancer center (VICC) along with enhancing research infrastructure, capacity-building, and impact at two minority-
serving institutions (MMC and TSU). Collectively, over the past twenty years of partnership, these collaborative
efforts provide a robust infrastructure to address and overcome cancer disparities while expanding research
opportunities, recruitment and training. Our Triad has benefited from sustained and strong collaborative
interactions between the three partner institutions, resulting in robust community and educational outcomes.
Moreover, the geographical placement of this Triad in Tennessee, a region with some of the highest cancer
incidence and mortality rates in the United States, also provides a unique opportunity for our Partnership to
positively impact outcomes for cancer patients in this geographical region. This region continues to have
significant cancer health disparities in lung, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers. In order to meet our ultimate
goals of overcoming cancer disparities while simultaneously strengthening research impact, the overall
objectives of this competing renewal application are to: 1) increase the participation in traditional, investigator-
initiated cancer research projects awarded to MMC and TSU faculty with collaborative guidance by senior VICC
faculty; 2) increase the number of investigator-initiated awards to VICC junior faculty that address cancer
disparities; 3) recruit, train and retain early-stage investigators to become independent leaders in cancer health
disparities and cancer research and training; 4) expand MVTCP participation in national oncology treatment and
interventional trials; 5) strengthen the physical and intellectual infrastructure for research at MMC and TSU; 6)
facilitate partnerships between community organizations and academic researchers, leading to hypothesis-
driven research projects that include the involvement of a community health educator; 7) increase the number
of MMC and TSU trainees engaged in cancer research; and 8) increase awareness of cancer research
opportunities and careers for minority high school, undergraduate, graduate and medical students through the
Pathway to Discovery program."

Autoimmune diseases (ADs) affect 50 million Americans and 12.5% of people worldwide, and for the vast
majority of AD patients, there is no cure or effective prevention methods. The root cause of ADs is immune attack
on self-tissues by auto-reactive effector lymphocytes and antibodies secreted by the lymphocytes. Therefore,
lymphocyte suppression has been utilized as a strategy to ameliorate ADs. This strategy has yielded drugs that
slow the progression of some ADs but do not prevent or cure ADs. Further, these drugs cause long-term immune
deficiency and render AD patients susceptible to lethal opportunistic infections. One core reason for these
deficiencies is the failure of current lymphocyte suppression drugs to focus on autoreactive effector cells. The
drugs suppress and deplete native lymphocytes that do not contribute to ADs, which cause unnecessary and
broad immune deficiency. Meanwhile, the current drugs fail to suppress all autoreactive effector lymphocytes:
only B effector cells or only T effector cells are suppressed. To address this issue, we propose a novel
lymphocyte suppression approach that encompasses all autoreactive effector cells but not naive cells. The
approach utilizes the programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1) as a biomarker to identify, target and eliminate
autoreactive effector cells. PD-1 is expressed on both B and T effector lymphocytes. Thus, it is possible to target
all autoreactive effector lymphocytes using the PD-1 marker. More importantly, PD-1-positive (PD-1+) cells have
been found to infiltrated inflamed tissues in ADs, and the infiltration is intensified while the ADs progress. An
enhancement of the activity and amplification of PD-1+ cells by blocking PD-1 on these cells induced and
aggravated ADs in animals and humans. On the contrary, our preliminary data showed that depletion of PD-1+
cells is very promising to treat autoimmune type-1 diabetes and chronic experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE). On the hand, naive lymphocytes do not express PD-1, so depletion of PD-1+ cells will
keep them intact. Taken together, we hypothesize that targeted depletion of PD-1-positive cells not only
ameliorates in ADs but also preserves healthy immunity. To test this hypothesis, we generated an elegant protein
molecule for in vivo PD-1+ cell depletion, aPD-1-ABD-PE. aPD-1-ABD-PE was designed to have three functional
elements, an anti-PD-1 antibody (aPD-1) to target PD-1+ cells, an albumin-binding domain (ABD) to increase
plasma presence of aPD-1-ABD-PE, and a Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) to kill the cells that aPD-1-ABD-PE
enters. aPD-1-ABD-PE has selective toxicity to PD-1+ cells. In this project, we will test the hypothesis through
three specific aims: Aim 1: Characterize and prepare aPD-1-ABD-PE as a tool for targeted PD-1+ cell depletion;
Aim 2: Establish that PD-1+ cell depletion ameliorates T1D, EAE, and SLE, three representative ADs; Aim 3:
Establish that long-term PD-1+ cell depletion does not cause long-term immune deficiency. This project responds
directly to the prominent need to improve the treatment for ADs, a priority area of study of the National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases."

The overarching goal of the Visual Sciences CoBRE (VS-CoBRE) is to optimize infrastructure and mentoring to
support a sustainable, multidisciplinary, and collaborative research environment at WVU around visual sciences.
The establishment of the VS-CoBRE will strengthen the scientific community focused on understanding
processes that are essential to visual health with the long-term goal of contributing to novel approaches for
prevention and treatment of blinding diseases that disproportionately affect Appalachia's population. West
Virginia has the 2nd highest rate of visual disability in the nation, and the incidence is projected to double by 2050.
We will achieve our goals by completing the following aims: Aim1, Support Project Leaders (PLs) to achieve
independent extramural funding; Aim 2, Promote the fundamental understanding of the visual system through
optimizing relevant technical infrastructure; Aim 3, Promote a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to
impactful visual sciences research; and Aim 4: Implement a rigorous strategy to evaluate the effectiveness of
the VS-CoBRE towards promoting a robust center of excellence in visual sciences. With our existing strengths
and research infrastructure network, coupled with the initiatives proposed in this VS-CoBRE, including mentoring
of our four-promising junior PLs, we are well-positioned to achieve our goal. The creation of a center of
excellence provides a venue for integrating efforts across the campus, including activities supported by NIGMS
including the WV CTSI and other CoBREs, the clinical enterprise in the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual
Sciences, and investigations led by basic biologists in the Departments of Biochemistry, Neuroscience, Biology,
and the program in Biomedical Engineering. The VS-CoBRE will coalesce vision scientists around a common
theme, enhance the intellectual environment, and cultivate cross collaborations. When the investigators
proposed for support by this grant achieve independence by obtaining an R01-equivalent award, we will leverage
the VS-CoBRE to recruit additional junior scientists whose work pertains to visual sciences. The core facilities
and research infrastructure supported by the CoBRE will also allow our investigators to produce research results
that will translate to patients, moving us toward our ultimate goal of reducing the burden of visual impairment
and its comorbidities in the Appalachian region, throughout the nation, and worldwide."
10778199,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Gene therapy for the X-linked bleeding disorder hemophilia holds much promise to accomplish a lasting cure.
Four clinical trials utilizing adeno-associated viral (AAV) gene transfer to the livers of males with severe
hemophilia are currently being investigated in multiple Phase III clinical trials. Hemophilia A (deficiency in factor
VIII, FVIII), the more common form of the disease (~80% of patients), has traditionally been more difficult to treat
by gene therapy because FVIII is a large molecule and not efficiently expressed and secreted. Nonetheless,
initial results demonstrated complete correction of the disease. However, FVIII levels declined substantially over
time, raising worrying questions about durability, and patients also experienced prolonged mild hepatotoxicity
despite steroid drug treatment during the first year of gene therapy. Multiple recent observations raise serious
questions about the safety of hepatic gene therapy for hemophilia A. These urgently need to be addressed so
that this promising approach can be safely applied to patients and to achieve sustained correction. For instance,
the reasons for hepatotoxicity and for the decline in FVIII expression are unclear, highlighting critical gaps in our
knowledge of the interactions between the vector and hepatocytes and between the FVIII expression and
hepatocytes, as well as the role of the immune system in long-term outcome. There is also renewed concern
about insertional mutagenesis. We will address these basic and mechanistic questions related to the biology of
AAV and FVIII. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that multiple interconnected features of AAV and FVIII
biology limit durability of therapeutic expression and pose serious safety concerns. Further, we postulate that
unraveling these mechanisms will allow for design of vectors and protocols that minimize these problems, thus
resulting in lasting therapy and enhanced safety. The program combines expertise in FVIII biology, cellular stress
responses, immunology, and AAV vector biology and is structured into 3 scientific Projects, an administrative
Core and 2 scientific Cores. Project 1 (Kaufman) seeks to overcome FVIII protein misfolding and cell toxicity.
Project 2 (Xiao) will uncover the mechanisms that lead to formation of subgenomic AAV vector particles that
form during vector production through nuclease and recombination activities. Project 3 (Herzog) will define the
mechanisms of innate and adaptive immune responses to AAV-FVIII gene transfer. The objectives of the three
projects will be supported by an administrative core (Core A), a core that provides human hepatocytes for in vitro
and in vivo studies (Core B), and a core that performs development and molecular analysis of AAV vectors (Core
C). Overall, this project applies the expertise of the individual investigators towards addressing major
unanswered questions in FVIII biology, gene therapy for hemophilia, liver-directed gene transfer, and molecular
and immunobiology of AAV vectors."
10535469,"The objective of this proposal is to identify viral and host factors that promote reovirus infection and cell killing of TNBC cells and identify small molecule inhibitors that can augment viral-mediated killing of cancer cells. In the U.S., breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus) is a segmented, nonenveloped dsRNA virus that predominantly infects transformed cells and is in Phase I-III clinical trials to assess its efficacy as a viral oncolytic against several cancers. Preliminary data indicate that serotype 1 reoviruses induce more efficient TNBC cell death than serotype 3 reoviruses and that cell death occurs via a caspase 3-independent pathway. RNA sequencing showed that IL-24 is highly upregulated during reovirus infection of TNBC cells and high-throughput screening identified topoisomerase inhibitors (doxorubicin, epirubicin, etoposide, and topotecan) that when paired with reovirus promote efficacious TNBC cell death. The central hypothesis is that reovirus infection with serotype 1 reoviruses in the presence of topoisomerase inhibitors induces complementary signaling pathways that result in TNBC cell death. Two integrated specific aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1 will elucidate mechanisms of reovirus-induced cell death of triple-negative breast cancer cells. Specific Aim 2 will determine how topoisomerase inhibitors impact reovirus infection. These experiments will enhance an understanding of the mechanism viruses use to kill cancer cells, define how combinatorial virus and small molecule inhibitor regimens impact viral infection, and inform the development of personalized therapeutic options for patients afflicted with TNBC."

Alzheimer's Disease is steadily growing in prevelance, with a devastating public health impact. The prevelance
of Alzheimer's Disease is higher in African Americans compared to white Americans, thereby constituting a
health disparity. Interventions that prevent Alzheimer's Disease or change the course of cognitive decline
associated with Alzheimer's Disease are needed. Most older adults do not achieve the recommended levels of
physical activity, and this includes African Americans. Regular physical activity has proven to be a safe and
effective means to enhance cognitive function in older adults ranging from cognitively healthy to mildly
cognitively impaired. Therefore our study is focused on physical activity promotion, a potent approach to
modifying multiple neurobiological pathways implicated in Alzheimer's Disease. We evaluate exercise benefits
among elderly African Americans, who are understudied and in whom the natural course of
neurodegeneration, exercise effects in neuroprotection and neurodegeneration, and resulting clinical
phenotypes may differ. A large body of exisiting data suggests that exercise improves cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular functioning, and thus has the potential to enhance perivascular clearance of amyloid and
reduce chronic brain tissue ischemia, among other beneficial effects. At the same time, chronic exercise has
been shown to decrease central levels of inflammatory markers and increase central levels of neurotrophic
factors, which in turn promote protection against Alzheimer's Disease neurodegeneration pathways via a
variety of mechanisms. While physical activity interventions have been shown to have positive effects on these
factors and on resultant cognitive functioning in older adults, nearly all interventions have had a negligible
representation of African Americans. Prior dara suggests that African Americans enter their elderly years
against a backdrop of different lifespan exposures to a variety of factors relevant to neuroprotection and
neurodegeneration, including cardiovascular risk, exercise, diet, and education. In addition, prior data suggests
that the key genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's Diease (APOE) may have differing consequences for
Alzheimer's Diease risk among African Americans, and other genetic differences have the potential to
influence the brain benefits of physical activity in this community. We will utilize a randomized clinical trial to
address these questions. Participants will be randomized into a physical promotion intervention or a healthy
aging information group for 52 weeks. All participants will be of normal cognitive function. We will assess
cognitive function, brain structure and function, circulating hormones, objectively measured physical activity,
cardiorespiratory fitness, and telomere length. Our study will take the first step toward understanding whether
the hypothesized benefits of exercise for the brain carry over to elderly African Americans."

Precision nutrition is a new and now integral component of precision medicine that exploits differences in how
dietary components are absorbed, metabolized and converted to energy, and in how that energy is utilized,
resulting in widely varying dietary and nutrient requirements. In Hawaii, culture and customs influence dietary
preferences and economic disparities affect food access, further amplifying differences in nutritional needs and
individual responses to dietary components. Recognizing the innovative new opportunities available through
precision nutrition approaches, and the transformative potential for impactful nutritional health benefits,
particularly to the indigenous and underserved people of Hawaii, the University of Hawaii proposes to establish
a multicomponent center that enables multidisciplinary research with the thematic focus of Precision Nutrition.
The overall goal of this Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) Phase I proposal is the creation
of an Integrative Center for Precision Nutrition and Human Health at the University of Hawaiâi at Manoa
(UHM), âintegrativeâ in that it will encompass the interface between precision nutrition research and human
health outcomes. Our objectives are to build the foundation needed to grow a cadre of future leaders and
mentors in precision nutrition, the fruits of their efforts feeding the attainment of positive impacts on human
health, and to broadly disseminate and implement healthful strategies and interventions, nourishing the
sustainability of this Precision Nutrition COBRE. The overall goal of creating a Precision Nutrition COBRE
that fosters excellence in research, career development, and community health, will be achieved through
the following three Specific Aims: Aim 1: To create an Integrative Center for Precision Nutrition and Human
Health founded on impactful, scientifically rigorous research, education and training; built around a cadre of
promising future scientific leaders; and fostered by outstanding individually-crafted, team-facilitated mentoring
and career development activities. Aim 2: To provide research investigators education and training in cutting
edge technologies and access to state-of-the-art research Core Facilities, integrating these resources with
other research and training programs and facilities at UH, with community-based research in Hawaii, and with
the IDeA network across the nation. Aim 3: To promote development of strong collaborative relationships
between academic researchers and the community, based on culturally sensitive approaches, with the goal
of achieving tangible health benefits for all. Through the combined efforts of Precision Nutrition COBRE
researchers and our community partners, with the guidance of the Community Engagement and Outreach
Core, we will collaboratively advance precision nutrition, share and disseminate beneficial and healthful
strategies and interventions and positive outcomes throughout the community, the State and beyond. The
long term goal of the Center is to promote health through the advantages of precision nutrition, implemented
across the community and beyond, thereby producing lasting, far-reaching positive impacts on human health."

The goal of the Harvard-wide Program on Antibiotic Resistance is to apply innovative advanced
technologies to developing new strategies for treating leading causes of multidrug resistant
hospital-associated infection caused by staphylococci and enterococci. Although much attention
has appropriately been focused on the recent emergence of pan-resistant gram negative bacteria,
staphylococci and enterococci remain the leading causes of both morbidity and mortality
associated with infection by multidrug resistant ESKAPE pathogens, highlighting the limitation of
current therapeutic approaches. This multi-investigator project brings together experts from fields
ranging from mathematics and systems biology to infectious disease clinicians, and creates an
infrastructure for them to work collaboratively and synergistically, bringing new insights and
capabilities to bear in solving the leading public health crisis of antibiotic resistant infection.
Important discoveries and advances were made in the previous period of support by pressing the
envelope with new technologies, including the most advanced high throughput mutational and
comparative genomic analyses yet conducted on these microbes. In the proposed continuation
period, these technologies will be combined with the latest advances in microfluidics and single
cell time lapse imaging, to reveal new vulnerabilities of these bacteria for targeting by new
compounds. The development and use of innovative screens that de-risk targets as well as unveil
new opportunities, inform the design of new and more efficacious compounds for treating
multidrug resistant staphylococcal and enterococcal infection. Filling critical knowledge gaps
related to the various mechanisms by which microbes survive antibiotic challenge, including
stochastic entry into alternate growth states and actively reducing drug concentration through
efflux, make this program exceptionally comprehensive in its approach. Finally, this project
actively shares its results with the community by establishing and promoting information exchange
and networking with other academic and industry scientists, and by ensuring important antibiotic
discovery knowledge is preserved and transmitted to the next generation of scientists. As a result
of internal and external synergies, the impact of the Harvard-wide Program on Antibiotic
Resistance is much greater than would otherwise be possible through individual research efforts."
10833497,"Project Summary/Abstract
Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is an age-associated pre-malignant condition in which the progeny of hematopoietic
stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) with somatic mutations in about 20 genes dominate production of the
peripheral blood. While CH can persist without apparent health consequences for decades, it is associated with
increased risk for hematologic malignancies as well as all-cause mortality. Extrinsic conditions that favor
particular clones may separate asymptomatic CH carriers from those that progress to disease; yet, the specific
risk factors that can be modified to influence CH and its sequelae are largely unknown. The overall goal of this
Program, with three interactive Projects and two Cores, is to identify modifiable risk factors of CH-associated
HSPC expansion and subsequent malignant transformation, with a long-term view toward developing cancer
prevention strategies. A major feature of our Program is the use of novel mouse models to mimic CH and test
mechanisms that drive clone expansion and malignancy. In addition, our Program harnesses data from the
exceptional Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study â which has followed more than 9,500 diverse
participants (27% Black, 55% female) over 30 years â to evaluate CH and malignancy risk in older adults. Project
1 models CH in mice, with an emphasis on HSPCs bearing mutations in epigenetic regulators (particularly
Dnmt3a and Tet2), to determine how inflammatory stress and metabolic changes promote expansion, including
cooperation between clones, and malignant transformation. Project 2 focuses on CH with DNA Damage
Response (DDR)-associated gene mutations, and how exposure to genotoxic stress from chemotherapy and
smoking enables clonal dominance and malignant transformation in mice. Both Projects 1 and 2 explore potential
interventions to suppress clone expansion. Project 3 analyzes the contribution of inflammation and DNA
damaging exposures to clonal expansion and malignant transformation in the ARIC cohort, capitalizing on
clinical, proteomic, methylation, whole exome sequencing, and metabolomic data already available. Project 3
will also perform single cell sequencing to determine changes in CH clonal contribution over time, including clonal
interactions, and the evolution to malignancy in the context of external stressors. The Projects are highly
interactive, with Projects 1 and 2 iteratively testing the causal and mechanistic influence of risk factors nominated
by preliminary studies and by Project 3, and Project 3 performing additional analyses to validate findings
generated by Projects 1 and 2. Projects 1 and 2 are mutually enhanced by shared approaches and data.
Together, all Projects will deconvolute the role of risk factors to CH and malignancy. The Program is supported
by a Single Cell Sequencing and Bioinformatics Core and an Administrative Core. By focusing on modifiable risk
factors, we can stratify the risk of hematologic malignancy to inform clinical guidance of individuals with CH. Our
expert team combines clinicians and scientists with long track records of successful collaboration. Together we
will address this critical problem for human health and longevity."

The goal of this proposal is to create a resource for studying the genetic etiology of Alzheimer disease
(AD) in understudied and underserved populations. Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia
in the elderly and occurs in all ethnic and racial groups. The majority of genetic studies for AD have been
performed in non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) of European ancestry. While recent studies have begun expanding
into other populations, these populations are still under-represented in AD genomics, particularly for cases. A
major barrier to participation has been a lack of community-sensitive recruitment approaches that overcome
historical mistrust of research participation. Genetic studies across populations, in particular African Americans
(AA), have shown differences in both risk effect size (e.g., APOE) and risk loci (e.g., ABCA7). Further evaluation
suggests that genetic ancestry (independently or interacting with environmental/cultural factors) likely underlies
at least part of this heterogeneity. However, these efforts have been significantly underpowered to fully
characterize genetic risk factors of AD in US individuals of African (Af) and Hispanic/Latinx (HL) Ancestry. Full
characterization requires inclusion of additional populations of African genetic ancestry. To address this, we
propose here the creation of a large genomics resource for the study of AD in Af and HL Ancestry. This effort will
recruit, assess, sample, and genotype 13,000 individuals of diverse race/ethnicity, including 5,000 from Africa,
4,000 AA, and 4,000 HL. Clinical, phenotypic, and genetic data will be harmonized to other existing AD genomics
efforts (such as the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium and the Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project;
ADSP). Furthermore, we include two hypothesis-based Projects to demonstrate the utility and value of this
resource and begin understanding the genetic etiology of AA and HL populations. Broadly speaking, Project 1
tests genomic and phenotypic hypotheses within cohorts, while Project 2 tests ancestry-based hypotheses
across populations. These projects make extensive use of the data generated as part of this resource, as well
as taking advantage of existing data from the ADSP Follow-up Study (ADSP-FUS). Through the ADSP-FUS and
related studies we will access existing genomic case and control data from 13,100 African ancestry individuals,
15,900 HL individuals, and an additional 51,000 non-Hispanic whites. These studies, together with the focused
resource being generated here, represent a powerful approach to understanding the totality of AD risk, with new
loci and the mapping modifier loci that alter effect sizes. These studies will help illuminate the pan-population
genetic architecture of AD and provide the basis for identifying druggable targets. Using ancestral populations,
such those from Africa, to study risk modifiers is central to dissecting risk not only in those populations but also
among AA and Caribbean Hispanics (CHI), both with significant admixture. This resource will enable improved
disease prediction, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment through precision medicine, not only in in AA, Africans,
and other African admixed populations, but all individuals with AD."

and resources for conducting musculoskeletal clinical research, thereby expanding the community of
investigators performing high-quality musculoskeletal clinical research and increasing the amount of
available useful data for researchers, clinicians, patients and policy makers. During the first funding cycle
for our CCCR, we successfully engaged with a large cohort of musculoskeletal clinical researchers, introducing
them to new methods and datasets. Through multiple projects focused on musculoskeletal conditions and
funded by a variety of entities (NIH, AHRQ and PCORI), our group at the University of Washington (UW) has
accumulated extensive experience and expertise performing large, clinical, effectiveness trials and
transforming routine clinical data into research-ready data. We have developed state-of-the-art methods and
accumulated a sizeable amount of cleaned, analyzable data to be used by musculoskeletal researchers.
Because of our expertise and resources, we are well-positioned to advance our UW Core Center for Clinical
Research (CCCR) in Musculoskeletal Diseases, the UW Clinical Learning, Evidence, And Research (CLEAR)
Center for Musculoskeletal Disorders. Our UW CCCR Specific Aims are: 1) Continue to improve methods
for clinical musculoskeletal studies, focusing on confirmatory learning methods (study design for both
observational studies and clinical trials) and predictive learning methods (artificial intelligence for
image processing and electronic health record [EHR] data, both structured and unstructured free text);
2) Continue a Resource Core that provides analysis-ready data sets and services for conducting
clinical musculoskeletal research; and 3) Continue an Administrative Core that provides overall
leadership for the CCCR, manages the financial aspects of the CCCR, provides communication and
outreach to musculoskeletal researchers, and evaluates the success of our efforts. By achieving these
aims, we will improve access to expertise and research-quality data, improve analytics by developing
methods and pipelines for the analysis of clinical data, and apply and disseminate knowledge regarding the
conduct of rigorous clinical trials. Our CCCR will be able to provide useful research data to health system
decision-makers who will then be able to apply the results of the research to real-world decisions. By achieving
these aims, we will facilitate the transition of health care delivery systems to true learning health care systems.
Finally, and importantly, we will work with training programs to train the next generation of investigators in the
methods and approaches outlined above."

This type-2 application is to strengthen and build upon the established U54 Partnership between Morehouse
School of Medicine (MSM), Tuskegee University (TU), and the UAB OâNeal Comprehensive Cancer Center (UAB
OCCC). The Partnership, located in the heart of the Southeast, a region with a large, historically underserved,
African American (AA) population, has the overall goal of attaining excellence in research focused on elimination
of cancer health disparities and on reducing the cancer burden among underserved populations in the region.
The partnering institutions possess distinctive strengths that complement each other in achieving the proposed
goal through integrated research, education, and outreach. The primary objectives are to enhance productive
cancer research programs, to develop a pipeline of racial/ethnic minority investigators in cancer research at
MSM and TU, and to increase the level of involvement of investigators conducting research on cancer disparities
at the UAB OCCC. The Partnership has four Cores (Administrative, Outreach, Research Education, and
Planning & Evaluation); two Full Research Projects; one Pilot Research Project; and two Shared Resources
(Bioethics and Biostatistics/Bioinformatics). With these assets and activities, the Partnership will: 1) through the
two full projects, a) determine if amplification and overexpression of TRIP13 contribute to prostate cancer
aggressiveness and progression and b) develop combination therapy strategies that modulate the immune
microenvironment for colorectal cancers and identify alternative targets adaptable to personalized medicine. The
overall objectives of the Pilot Project are to characterize factors associated with uptake of lung cancer screening
(LCS) in two different health care systems and to explore barriers and facilitators to LCS at the system, provider,
and patient levels that will inform the development of a multi-level intervention. 2) through the Outreach Core,
implement and evaluate an evidence-based, theory-informed, multi-level, clinical trial and cancer genomics
education program that addresses the determinants for AA and Latinx participation in clinical trials and cancer
genomics studies; 3) through the Research Education Core, employ an integrated research education program
that involves capacity building and linkages to high school, undergraduate and graduate/medical students,
postdoctoral fellows, medical residents, and early-stage investigators, allowing them to pursue careers in cancer
research; and 4) provide funding for additional Pilot Research projects. The Planning & Evaluation Core will
continually assess/evaluate outcomes of the cores, research projects, and shared resources. The Bioethics
Shared Resource will promote and ensure adherence to bioethical principles and address ethical considerations
in relationships between the institutions and between the institutions and communities. The Biostatistics and
Bioinformatics Shared Resource will deliver statistical and bioinformatics support for all activities. Together,
these actions will contribute to elimination of cancer health disparities."

Recombinant Factor VIIa (rFVIIa) for Acute hemorrhagic Stroke Administered at Earliest Time (FASTEST) Trial
is a randomized, double-blind, controlled global trial of rFVIIa plus best standard therapy vs. best standard
therapy alone for patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Our central hypothesis is that treatment with
rFVIIa within two hours of onset in appropriately selected patients with spontaneous ICH improves outcome as
measured by the ordinal distribution of the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days, as compared to placebo.
We will test our hypothesis in 860 patients recruited at 100 hospital sites and at least 15 mobile stroke units
(MSUs) within the NINDS StrokeNet (70 sites) and key global institutions (30 sites) with large volumes of
patients with ICH and ability to treat within 2 hours of onset. Participating countries include the U.S., Canada,
United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Japan, and Australia. We will include subjects with a volume of ICH < 60 cc,
no intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) or a small volume of IVH (IVH score â¤ 7), age â¤ 80, GCS â¥ 8, and treated
within 120 minutes from last known normal. To minimize time-to-treatment, the study will use exception from
informed consent and MSUs with a goal of Â½ of patients treated within 90 minutes as accomplished in the
NINDS t-PA trials. We will recruit the 860 patients over 3 1/2 years and randomize them in a double-blinded
fashion to rFVIIa 80 micrograms/kg dose (maximum 8mg dose) or placebo. Subjects in both arms will receive
best medical therapy as per published AHA Guidelines for ICH, including a target blood pressure of 140 mm
Hg. The primary efficacy outcome measure is the ordinal distribution of the mRS at 90 days. Primary safety
outcomes will include ischemic events (cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction, and pulmonary embolus)
within 4 days of study medication. To measure growth of ICH and IVH, all subjects will have baseline non-
contrast CT and at 24 hours. Centralized volumetric measurements of ICH, IVH, and edema will be done for
both time-points. The overall principal investigators (PIs) for the Trial include Joseph Broderick, James Grotta,
Andrew Naidech, and Jordan Elm (primary statistical PI) as well as PIs for each participating non-U.S. country.
In summary, the goal of FAST is to find the first scientifically proven treatment for acute ICH."
10840396,"This P01 will address fundamental gaps in knowledge that currently impede translation of findings in
the preclinical literature to improved clinical practice regarding the utility of oxytocin as a pain therapeutic and
potential disease-modifying agent to prevent the transition from acute to chronic pain. Oxytocin itself is the only
clinically available tool for translational studies in many areas â neuroprotection, anxiety, sleep, social
behaviors, addiction, and pain. Most rodent and human studies of oxytocin lack strong scientific rigor, with
only half of the clinical studies examining pain demonstrating efficacy, and we have minimal ability to
understand oxytocin effects within and across species. Since chronic pain is usually reduced acutely by
peripheral nerve block, peripheral input is necessary, but most research assumes that input is normal and pain
reflects ongoing central sensitization. We and others challenge these ideas, showing that LTMRs are
desensitized after injury whereas fast high threshold mechanoreceptors (A-HTMRs) are sensitized and
behavioral recovery coincides with return to normal function of both afferent subtypes. Importantly, oxytocin
acutely moves LTMR and A-HTMR dysfunction after injury towards normal. Pain resolves quicker in women
after cesarean delivery than other pelvic surgeries, and hypersensitivity resolves quicker in rodents when
neuropathic injury is performed after delivery, an effect blocked by inhibition of oxytocin action. These data
suggest that oxytocin may alter the process of chronic pain development after injury or surgery, and has the
potential to be not just an acute analgesic, but a disease-modifying therapeutic. Oxytocin has prosocial,
anxiolytic, and trust enhancing effects according to small studies in rodents and humans, but the circuitry and
role of these central actions on speeding recovery from pain and disability after injury are unexplored. This P01
will address these gaps and advance the field of pain research through the coordinated interactions between
the preclinical and clinical projects across 3 specific areas. The first is extrapolation of the pharmacokinetics of
oxytocin across species, such that drug exposure in relevant compartments with time are being studied in a
coordinated manner that permits interpretation of physiological or behavioral effects between rats and humans
Second is the study of primary sensory afferent physiology across species that determines how oxytocin alters
specific nerve fiber types and the key electrical properties related to pain transmission, including multiple
modes of nociceptive stimulation and their interaction. Third, we study pain behaviors beyond reflexive
responses or verbal report in animals and humans, respectively, which may offer greater translational value.
Collectively, the coordinated and synergistic nature of these studies will hopefully provide clarity on the
potential of oxytocin to mitigate chronic pain development after injury, and the context within such effects
occur."

not fully understand the mechanisms by which normal and pathological changes in blood pressure are achieved,
nor how the vasculature can both influence and be impacted by changes in blood pressure. This new Program
Project Grant is based on the overall hypothesis that perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has bidirectional
interactions with the other layers of a blood vessel and is a critical partner with these layers to form an integrated
system that maintains vascular health. Our collective preliminary work has led to the hypothesis that PVAT
and its primary components â the adipocyte and progenitor cells, the immune cells, and neuronal
innervation/neurohumoral control âare central integrators of overall vascular health/function. This grant
will enable foundational studies that are critical to understanding how the elements of PVAT work together, and
ultimately influence vascular tone. This grant is unique in that it will also interrogate how (patho)physiological
challenges (e.g. change in stretch, pressure) placed on a vessel affect PVAT function. Our studies will progress
to a model of high fat (HF)-diet induced hypertension, a situation of elevated vascular pressure and PVAT
burden. This work will use models that allow for the most rigorous experimentation: mice in nerve- and adipocyte
progenitor lineage-tracing; optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches; rats as a model organism for HF-diet
induced hypertension; pressure imposition through a novel mid-thoracic aortic coarcted model; novel
microscopic and bioinformatic work; and human vasculature + PVAT for translational potential. Our collective,
novel approach contrasts directly with the plethora of literature that investigates how the PVAT secretome
influences vascular function. We will determine, through projects supported by four cores (administrative,
animal, bioinformatic and microscopy), whether: 1) PVAT possesses the ability to mechanotransduce and has
significant stiffness that contributes to vascular stiffness; 2) PVAT is innervated or under neurohumoral control
with functional consequence; 3) whether the unique microenvironment of PVAT influences immune cell function;
and 4) how the fate of adipocyte progenitors is influenced by vascular stretch. Investigators are deeply
invested in the planning of, execution of and learning from experiments carried out in projects and cores
other than theirs; this work was purposefully developed in this way to be synergistic. This integrated
work advances human health by redefining the functional vessel, a redefinition that could have significant impact
on not only hypertension but all physiologies and dysfunctions which involve the vasculature."

An increasing number of studies indicate that some patients with pancreas ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have
exceptional and durable responses to therapy, both standard of care and, more rarely to immune-based
therapies. There is a unique opportunity to understand the genetic and molecular mechanisms that underlie
these exceptional responses or define mechanisms of intrinsic resistance to therapy to prospectively guide
clinical management and ultimately increase overall survival for all patients with pancreas cancer. We propose
a Specialized Program of Research Excellence in Pancreas Cancer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
(the MSK Pancreas SPORE) to leverage cutting-edge molecular knowledge of pancreas biology and clinical
innovations to advance translational research in pancreas cancer. Our long-term translational objective is to
demonstrate that prospective, next-generation molecular approaches combined with state-of-the-art clinical
management can improve outcomes of patients with pancreas malignancies. We will specifically focus on the
most challenging disease settings, locally advanced and metastatic PDAC, where the clinical needs are most
profound. To achieve this objective, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will leverage current state-of-
the-art and novel therapies to improve outcomes for patients with stage III and IV PDAC by building upon recent
developments in cytotoxic and targeted therapies and apply these agents and combinations in novel disease
settings. In Aim 2, we will apply innovation in molecular characterization of PDAC to drive clinical management
by building upon our extensive expertise in imaging, molecular diagnostics, biomarker development, and single-
cell analyses to develop and validate prospective biomarkers of treatment response and resistance. In Aim 3,
we will investigate two avenues of surmounting intrinsic immunotherapy resistance in PDAC: synthetic lethality
of combination PARP inhibition and immune checkpoint blockade, and via activation of the interleukin-33 â group
2 innate lymphoid cell (IL33-ILC2) axis. We expect that successful completion of these aims will provide new
insights into PDAC biology, establish new collaborations, alter treatment paradigms, and ultimately improve
disease-free and overall survival in pancreas cancer."

The etiology of Alzheimerâs disease and related dementias (ADRD) is multifactorial and given the current lack
of disease-modifying treatments, there is a growing need to better understand the roles of modifiable risk
factors. The overarching goal of this Einstein Aging Study Program Project (EAS P01) renewal is to
elucidate pathways linking behavioral, social/emotional and metabolic health, as well as environmental factors
to cognitive decline prior to onset of ADRD. The EAS cohort is a diverse community-based sample from Bronx
County, NY, and provides the opportunity to examine social factors related to racial/ethnic disparities in
cognitive health. In the current funding period, we developed and applied ecological momentary assessment
(EMA) methods and aligned them with robust clinic-based measures of cognitive performance to identify early
cognitive changes and modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline. We will expand upon this experience by
utilizing mobile devices that capture the dynamic time-varying nature of risk factors and cognitive performance
as participants engage in their usual daily activities. Our experience with ambulatory assessment paired with
our expertise in conventional methods and strong statistical expertise are major strengths of the proposal. The
robust conventional cognitive battery provides domain specific measures of cognitive status and decline,
supports the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and facilitates comparison with other studies. We
propose four thematically connected projects, to measure exposures in relation to the primary cognitive
outcomes: cognitive performance, cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and blood-based AD
biomarkers. Project 1 will assess combined effects of sleep health, physical activity and sedentary behavior.
Project 2 will investigate the independent, and joint effects of social/emotional health, inflammation and
markers of biological aging. Project 3 will measure person-specific exposure to air pollution to investigate the
effects of particulate matter exposure. Project 4 utilize continuous glucose monitoring in Type 2 diabetics to
examine effects of glucose regulation. The resources and expertise within these integrated projects, will be
supported by six closely linked cores. These combined resources will enhance our ability to examine biological
mechanisms that may underlie associations of exposures with cognitive outcomes including inflammation,
vascular processes, markers of neurodegeneration. Information will inform future targeted interventions to
prevent of delay ADRD onset. EAS researchers will continue to mentor junior investigators to train the next
generation of cognitive aging scientists in innovative approaches to clinical research. Through oongoing
national and international collaborations the EAS will continue as a valuable resource for the ADRD research
community."

Project Summary / Abstract
Now in its 22nd year of operation, Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) was the first consortium
model, NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. The consortium is comprised of 1,100 members from
five principal Harvard-affiliated hospitals and two Harvard health science schools: Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center (BIDMC), Boston Childrenâs Hospital (BCH), Brigham and Womenâs Hospital (BWH), Dana-
Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), Harvard Medical School (HMS), Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health
(HSPH), and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Our overarching goals are to identify the genetic,
biological, environmental, and behavioral bases of cancer and to develop effective strategies to reduce risk
and improve preventive and treatment outcomes. Our catchment area is the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
Our steady progress over the last two decades has depended on the combined resources and talent at the 7
institutions; the unique consortium structure that enables collaborative bench-to-bedside translational research
by population, basic, and clinical members; and well-coordinated Center leadership. DF/HCC embodies: 1) an
integrated structure that aspires to excellence in research and accelerates clinically effective discoveries, 2) a
cohesive research community for cross-institutional and transdisciplinary collaborations, and 3) a collectively
large patient population that expedites the conduct of innovative clinical trials. Our work occurs in 18 Research
Programs that cross scientific and institutional boundaries and span the gamut of population, basic, and clinical
cancer research; members excel in each sphere. Two entities, a Center for Cancer Equity and Engagement
(CCEE) and an Office for Cancer Research Education and Training (OCRET), help fulfill our responsibilities to
the catchment area and to train future leaders in cancer research. The Center supports 14 Shared Resources
that provide members with quality research services that cannot easily be duplicated in individual laboratories
or institutions. A unified clinical research infrastructure serves all seven consortium institutions and makes it
possible for members to conduct innovative early-phase (proof-of-concept and Phase I/II) clinical trials across
the consortium. A portfolio of grants that transcend organizational and disciplinary boundaries (e.g., SPOREs,
Program Projects, SU2C Dream Teams) reflect our collective translational and collaborative ideals.
Our next phase of work is guided by a multi-part Strategic Plan that emphasizes mechanistic understanding of
cancer, early cancer detection, equity, new therapeutic avenues, and a renewed commitment to education and
mentorship. Underlying these goals are a culture and infrastructure streamlined for collaborative investigation
of populations, fundamental cellular and molecular mechanisms, primary tumor specimens, and the barriers to
improved cancer-related outcomes in all segments of society."
10794925,"The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) therapeutic pipeline is rapidly expanding. The NCLs are rare, devastating, neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorders that mainly affect children. Juvenile NCL (CLN3 disease) is the most prevalent form, with a complex set of multi-domain signs and symptoms that gradually progress over 20 years and culminate in premature death. Currently, there are no approved disease-modifying therapies. This proposal will foster collaboration between international leaders in NCL research, the University of Rochester (Rochester, New York) and the University of Hamburg (Hamburg, Germany). This multi-center, multi-national partnership mirrors the future model for clinical trial implementation and lays the foundation for development of novel therapeutics for CLN3 disease. The proposal will address critical challenges for the design and implementation of clinical trials in CLN3 disease: optimizing sensitive clinical assessments that measure how patients feel and function, validating early readouts of efficacy for go-no go decision making in phase 2 trials, and preparing for rigorous and consistent disease evaluation across multiple clinical trial sites. In parallel, our aims are: 1) to refine approaches to systematic and comprehensive assessment of CLN3 disease in order to best quantify progression in future trials, 2) to validate quantitative brain neuroimaging measurements as biomarkers of disease progression for phase 2 trials, and 3) to prepare for reproducible multi-site use of clinical outcome assessment tools. During the award period, we will engage the Food and Drug Administration in clinical outcome assessment and biomarker qualification processes to ensure optimal preparation for future regulatory review processes for emerging CLN3 disease therapeutic trials."
10795741,"PROJECT SUMMARY
TDP-43 proteinopathies represent a set of neurological disorders characterized by relocalization of the RNA-
binding protein TDP-43 from its native nuclear compartment to the cytoplasm where it accumulates into
aggregates. TDP-43 pathology is found in more than 95% of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),
approximately half of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases, and more than 30% of Alzheimerâs disease patients.
TDP-43 is involved in fundamental RNA processing activities and binds thousands of transcripts to regulate their
expression, splicing and transport. We and others have recently identified a critical role for TDP-43 in regulating
the expression of the neuronal growth-associated factor stathmin-2, a tubulin-binding protein involved in axon
outgrowth and regeneration. TDP-43 disruption induces truncation (by aberrant splicing and premature
polyadenylation) of stathmin-2 pre-mRNA, thereby silencing stathmin-2 when TDP-43 nuclear levels fall.
Stathmin-2 is suppressed in affected neurons from the vast majority of ALS/FTD patients, and the neuronal
regeneration capacity of iPSC-derived motor neurons with TDP-43 depletion can be rescued by increasing levels
of STMN2. Notably, while stathmin-2 is the human mRNA most affected by reduction in TDP-43, the stahmin-2
pre-mRNA is neither bound nor regulated by TDP-43 in rodents, a major caveat for animal modeling of TDP-43
proteinopathies. Here we propose to use newly generated mouse models to determine whether inactivated (Aim
1) or humanized stathmin-2 (Aim 2) alleles synergize with TDP-43, progranulin, or C9ORF72 ALS/FTD
mutations to drive motor neuron or cognitive disease. While evidence supports that stathmin-2 is essential for
axonal regeneration, the contribution of stathmin-2 loss in neurodegeneration remains to be determined. We
propose an ambitious program to establish the impact of in vivo stathmin-2 reduction in TDP-43 proteinopathies.
Mouse models generated in this project will recapitulate a major molecular alteration associated with TDP-43
proteinopathy and represent an important platform for therapeutic development in ALS/FTD. In addition,
recognizing that restoration of stathmin-2 level is an attractive strategy with broad implications in
neurodegenerative diseases, we will test the therapeutic potential of antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) that
prevent aberrant splicing of Stmn2 (Aim 3). This collaborative effort has the potential to uncover new insights on
the contribution of stathmin-2 loss in neurodegeneration, to generate new preclinical models, and to develop a
novel therapeutic strategy for ALS and FTD."

This COBRE proposal seeks to establish the Kansas Center for Metabolism and Obesity REsearch (KC-MORE)
which will unify investigators from multiple departments and research centers at the University of Kansas Medical
Center to focus research on the pathology of obesity, metabolic dysfunction, and obesity-related disease.
Obesity is a critical problem that is harming the health of people in Kansas as well as the entire U.S. New
research-driven solutions and therapies are needed to prevent and treat obesity, investigate metabolic
signatures that underly obesity, and examine mechanisms by which obesity initiates chronic disease. The KC-
MORE will serve to merge these areas of focus by (1) creating a shared intellectual home for obesity-related
researchers through a common educational and seminar program, (2) providing funding and mentorship for early
stage obesity-related investigators to establish independent research careers, (3) establishing scientific cores to
facilitate translational research of both early stage and established investigators, and (4) partnering with
departments to jointly recruit new investigators to KUMC focused on themes of the KC-MORE. This central role
in leading and coordinating obesity research and incentivizing future resources and recruitment will allow KUMC
to synergize efforts and form multi-disciplinary collaborations on obesity, metabolism, and obesity-induced
disease research in ways that would not occur without COBRE funding. The KC-MORE will be led by two multi-
PIs, Drs. Steven Weinman and John Thyfault, and a renowned senior investigator, Dr. Joseph Donnelly who will
serve as Chair of the Steering Committee and lead human energy balance research. These leaders have multi-
disciplinary but complimentary expertise in basic, clinical, and translational research. Phase 1 of the Center will
support the development of four Research Project Leaders (RPLs) with studies on neural control of energy
balance, clinical-based approaches to weight loss in rural communities, and basic mechanisms of obesity-related
fatty liver disease and hypertension. KC-MORE will also administer a Pilot Awards Program to develop additional
KC-MORE researchers. The KC-MORE will lead 3 new scientific cores that provide a foundation for translational
research capabilities (the Metabolism (MET) core, the Cells, Tissues, Bioanalysis and Bioinformatics (CTBB)
core, and the Human Energy Balance (HEB) core). The cores will support infrastructure and methodologies for
the Research Project Leaders, the Pilot Award recipients, and a large pool of established obesity-related
researchers on campus. A critical goal of phase 1 of the KC-MORE COBRE will be to help RPLs develop
independent, R01-funded research programs. Overall, the establishment of the KC-MORE will serve to develop
a translational and multi-disciplinary obesity research program that will have a significant future impact by
reducing the burden of obesity-related disease conditions."
10556331,"HIV infection impairs immunity and immune perturbations persist even after durable virologic control. This
population has a high incidence of using prescription opioids or injection opioids that lead to dependence.
Opioids are known to be immunosuppressive, and the combination of HIV and opioids can potentially prove
to be disastrous for the immune system, yet this area has been grossly understudied. Our recent project on
immunity in HIV (AI108472) utilized influenza vaccination as a probe for assessing immunity in HIV+. We
observed that HIV+ had lower vaccine responses than uninfected, and a subgroup of HIV+ drug abusers
had worse antibody response than non-abusers. We could classify participants as vaccine responders (VR)
and vaccine non-responders (VNR). In studying mechanisms of immune defects in VNR, we identified
quantitative and qualitative defects in peripheral T follicular helper cells (pTfh), which are a subset of CD4 T
cells that are essential for vaccine-induced antibody responses. The pTfh displayed a skewed polarization
away from a favorable IL-21 secreting phenotype towards a detrimental IL-2 secreting Th1 phenotype,
coupled with abundance of inflammatory markers, resulting in failure of pTfh to provide B cells with the
helper signals required for secreting antibodies. Our central hypothesis is that chronic opioid use blunts the
immune response to impair the generation of antibodies and exacerbates the immune dysfunction of HIV
even in virally controlled patients. We will recruit opioid users and non- users in HIV negative and virally
suppressed HIV+ populations to address key questions on the effect of opioids on the antibody response
following seasonal influenza vaccination. The project has 3 aims: 1. To evaluate basal state of inflammation
and immune/activation in relation to pTfh phenotype and the magnitude and quality of flu vaccine response.
2. To characterize pTfh by phenotypic, functional and transcriptomic analyses and 3. To test interventions
for potential reversal of opioid induced immune deficiency in VNR. We will use a combination of single cell
technologies to gain high resolution datasets including multi-parameter flow cytometry and the 10x single
cell genomics platform combined with indexed surface marker expression using novel nucleic acid-tagged
antibodies. In order to gain a comprehensive understanding on the topic of opioid effect on immune function
in presence of HIV infection, we will evaluate immune cells ex vivo from the populations of interest using
unbiased genomics approaches to obtain a snapshot of immune perturbation compared to healthy controls.
In vitro studies with purified cell subsets and addition of morphine during antigen exposure will allow for
mechanistic evaluation of opioid impact on the immune system. These studies are feasible, given our
expertise in the technologies described and access to the required population through our ID Clinics and
specialized programs dealing with opioid addicted populations. We expect to provide novel insight into
immune perturbations that will help in strategizing vaccine approaches, including those for opioid vaccines."

This proposal describes a five-year career development program that will lead the PI to a career as an
independent physician-scientist, studying mechanisms and potential therapeutics of developmental and
epileptic encephalopathies.
Applicant: Dr. Ziobro holds M.D. and Ph.D. degrees and has completed specialty clinical training in both Child
Neurology and Pediatric Epilepsy. She has previous experience in neuroscience research using rodent,
neuronal cell culture, and organotypic hippocampal cell culture models of acquired epilepsy. This career
development plan includes a period of mentored research designed to develop the applicantâs knowledge in
advanced imaging techniques, viral vector design, brain slice electrophysiology, and interneuron development.
These skills will complement her current skill-set and propel her development as an independent researcher.
The concepts learned during this training period will be broadly applicable to multiple disease processes and
allow for significant clinical translation in a clinically relevant field of study.
Research Plan: PCDH19-clustering epilepsy (PCE) is one of the most common monogenic developmental
and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), characterized by cognitive impairment and intractable seizure clusters
starting in infancy. PCDH19 is and X-linked gene that encodes a transmembrane cell adhesion molecule,
critical for cell interactions during brain development. PCE affects females and rare mosaic males, while males
expressing only mutant PCDH19 do not develop epilepsy. A leading hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is
that it occurs due to cellular interference associated with random X-inactivation (or mosaic mutations) in which
cells expressing wild type and those expressing mutant PCDH19 fail to interact properly during brain
development, which is supported by a preliminary data showing a unique cell segregation pattern of Pcdh19+
and Pcdh19- neurons in the cortex and hippocampus of the PCE mouse model. Our central hypothesis is that
mosaic Pcdh19 expression alters interneuron development in the hippocampal CA1 region leading to aberrant
network formation, hyperexcitability and increased seizure susceptibility. This proposal will characterize
histologic (Aim 1) physiologic (Aim 2) and developmental (Aim 3) mechanisms of PCE. This study will provide
significant insight into the mechanisms of PCE and guide potential therapeutic strategies that may be
applicable to multiple genetic epilepsies."

ABSTRACT
Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the bacterial pathogen that causes gonorrhea, is now considered an âUrgent Threatâ
due to the recent emergence of strains with multi-drug resistance to the antibiotics that are frequently used
during treatment. Due to the emergence of these `superbug' strains, we are progressing towards the spread of
untreatable gonococcal infections. This situation has added to the urgency for developing a vaccine to prevent
these infections, as untreated gonococcal infections can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic
pregnancy, infertility and invasive infections. Development of a gonococcal vaccine has been challenging due
to the remarkable ability of the bacterium to vary its surface components and suppress the development of a
protective immune response against reinfection in humans, and due to the lack of appropriate animal models
available to study infection and immunity of this pathogen. The primary focus of this proposal is to further
develop a protein-based vaccine that targets the constitutively-expressed gonococcal transferrin binding
protein B (TbpB), which captures iron from human transferrin. It is an ideal target since the transferrin receptor
in N. gonorrhoeae is required for survival on the mucosa and we have shown that it is capable of reducing
colonization in a mouse model. We have demonstrated that transferrin-binding defective mutants of TbpB
induce a more protective immune response than the wild type proteins, and are currently finalizing the
antigenic composition of our TbpB-based vaccine. In this project, we will scale-up and optimize production and
purification of our antigens, develop an optimal vaccine formulation and perform all the steps required for
implementing Phase I trials in humans. Cross-protection will be evaluated in a lower genital tract colonization
model and a model of pelvic inflammatory disease using female transgenic mice expressing human CEACAM
receptors and human transferrin, which facilitate gonococcal mucosal attachment and growth, respectively.
Together with an industrial sponsor, Vaxiron, Inc., we will develop quality control tools and metrics for
assessing vaccine antigen formulations, transfer production of our vaccine formulation to a contract
manufacturing organization, complete all the quality, stability and toxicology studies required for regulatory
approval to proceed to a future Phase I clinical trial after the culmination of this project."
10619434,"Unveiling mechanisms of neural stimulation technologies is an important goal of the Brain Initiative (RFA-NS-20-006). Transcranial electric stimulation (TES) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique to provide wide-range effects on seizure control, behaviors, and cognition by generating weak electric fields in the brain. It is still an open question of how these weak electric fields can interact effectively with neural activity, and the mechanism of action of TES is still unknown. Our laboratory has recently found that ephaptic coupling (non-synaptic neural coupling by electric fields) plays a significant role in neural recruitment and could possibly explain the TES-induced effects. We propose to test the hypothesis that ephaptic coupling is the mechanism of action of TES. With the combination of in-vitro novel voltage imaging techniques and optogenetic stimulation in the transgenic mice and in-vivo electrophysiological experiments, we will study the links between the ephaptic coupling and three known TES-induced effects in the following independent specific aims: 1) Investigate the role of ephaptic coupling in TES-induced propagation speed modulation of interictal spikes. 2) Determine the role of ephaptic coupling in TES-induced seizure suppression. 3) Study the role of ephaptic coupling in TES-induced effects on neural oscillations. This proposal, if successful, will provide a novel insight into TES-induced effects, reveal the mechanism of action of TES, and open the door to the development of improved TES protocols with improved efficiency for this non-synaptic therapeutic modality."

Binge eating (BE) occurs in most eating disorders and at significant rates in the community, including among
children and adolescents. The chronic course of BE and significant psychiatric and medical morbidity further
attest to its public health significance. Critically, although males account for up to one-half of BE cases, there is
a paucity of research exploring risk for BE in males and studies exploring biological factors are nearly non-
existent. Adrenal and gonadal androgens are one set of male-specific biological factors that may be critical
given that they drive sexual differentiation and pubertal development in males, they cause changes in palatable
food intake in animals, and they are potent regulators of gene transcription within neurobiological systems
relevant to BE. Moreover, animal studies and our preliminary human data show that lower levels of androgens
(e.g., testosterone) are predictive of higher phenotypic levels of BE and stronger genetic influences on BE in
males during puberty, but no large-scale study has examined these biological processes. Larger-scale studies
that span the full range of pubertal maturation (e.g., adrenarche through gonadarche) and comprehensively
assess adrenal and gonadal androgens are a necessary next step that will enhance scientific Rigor and
provide critical Reproducibility and translational data. The long-term objective of the proposed work is to
identify the role of androgens on phenotypic and genetic risk for BE in boys during puberty. The Specific Aims
are to: 1) examine whether lower levels of adrenal and/or gonadal androgens contribute to BE in boys during
puberty; and 2) examine if genetic factors are mechanisms that drive phenotypic effects of adrenal and
gonadal androgens on BE in boys during puberty. Participants will include 1,000 same-sex male twins (ages 7-
17) recruited through the Michigan State University Twin Registry. Questionnaires and interviews will be
administered to the twins and at least one parent to assess BE, other mood/behavioral symptoms (e.g., mood,
anxiety), and the physical changes of puberty. Salivary samples will be collected and assayed for adrenal and
gonadal androgen levels. Multilevel structural equation models will be used to examine the phenotypic effects
of adrenal and gonadal androgens on BE during puberty. Latent twin moderation models will examine the
extent to which lower levels of adrenal and gonadal androgens are associated with stronger genetic effects on
BE during puberty. All analyses will also explore whether observed effects are independent of other factors
(i.e., adiposity, anxiety, depression) that change during puberty and are associated with androgens and BE.
Findings from our innovative, multi-method project have the potential to significantly increase understanding of
the causes of BE in boys by identifying androgens as novel neurobiological factors that contribute to BE.
Greater insight into etiological mechanisms of BE in boys will narrow the search for putative neurobiological
systems and genes and contribute to improved treatment and prevention of these syndromes."
10741123,"ABSTRACT
Injection is an increasingly common route of administration for opioids and other drugs in the U.S. Unsafe
injection drug use (IDU) behavior threatens recent progress made in reducing HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV)
infections among persons who inject drugs (PWID), which is a major impediment to achieving ambitious
national goals for reducing new HIV infections. During the past decade, New York State has experienced
growing rates of opioid use disorder and, consequently, increases in IDU-related infectious diseases. New
York has strong political will to reduce the burden of these infections among PWID and is the first U.S. state to
commit to both âEnding the AIDS Epidemicâ and HCV elimination strategies. However, New York, like other
states, does not have a current, statewide estimate of how many PWID need infectious disease prevention
services. Robust estimates of PWID population sizes are needed in New York and elsewhere to facilitate
optimal allocation of scarce resources, measure risk-specific infectious disease burden among PWID, and
assess coverage of prevention interventions. We propose to estimate PWID population size and associated
risk-specific disease and prevention intervention coverage rates in New York using multiple systems estimation
(MSE) with a combination of extant administrative and PWID survey data. MSE is an application of capture-
recapture methods that allows estimation of underlying population size using joint probabilities of observing
individuals in linked administrative datasets vis-Ã -vis their receipt of a service or diagnosis. We will apply MSE
methods to linked, statewide datasets in New York including claims data, inpatient and emergency room
electronic hospital records, drug treatment program data, and infectious disease surveillance data. We will also
improve the rigor of MSE methods by addressing potential violations of key statistical assumptions through
augmented estimation models, partially informed by survey data currently being collected by the study team.
Our Specific Aims are: (1)To estimate PWID population size in New York State using MSE with indications of
current IDU behavior from linked administrative datasets, overall and by region, sex, and age; (2) To create
refined PWID population size estimates accounting for bias due to unequal probabilities of observing
individuals in datasets; (3) To allocate state PWID population size to all 62 counties using a standardization
modeling approach; (4) To compute key epidemiologic indicators needed to measure infectious disease risk
among PWID: risk-specific HIV and HCV diagnosis rates, syringe service program utilization rates, and number
of PWID initiating IDU during past year; (5) To disseminate estimates and methodology using the AIDSVu data
visualization platform. The national impact of this work, using New York as a model, will be to establish a
robust, replicable method for producing estimates that can guide efforts to improve PWID health and reduce
the burden of HIV and HCV in this high-risk, under-studied group."

cutting-edge TWH concepts, research findings, and program materials in multiple formats to advance
workplace practice; (3) developing policy recommendations; (4) building the capacity of professionals and
organizations to recognize the value of a TWH program and to strengthen the skills and organizational
resources needed to achieve it; and (5) educating graduate students from multiple disciplines in TWH through
their involvement in research and dissemination activities. Our proposed Center activities include two large
intervention research projects, one smaller exploratory research project, an Outreach core for research
translation and dissemination, and an Evaluation & Planning core to provide centralized administration and

to improve the mental well-being of teachers, with a focus on work-life balance, burnout, and work engagement
(âTotal Teacher Healthâ); (2) a large intervention study to develop and evaluate TWH interventions designed to
promote the health and safety of healthcare workers, with a focus on sustainability and union involvement in
implementation processes (the âSHIFT-IIâ study); and (3) a smaller exploratory study to develop and evaluate
professional education programs designed to integrate TWH concepts into employer crisis preparation and
planning efforts (the âTWH-ECPâ study). Innovative aspects of our Center evaluation and planning methods
include the use of cross-project methodological teams, a transdisciplinary framework for sharing knowledge,
and a unique three-campus collaboration involving experts from engineering, medicine, epidemiology, public
health, nursing, psychology, education, and management. Our experience shows that a worker-centered
approach to TWH that involves workers in the design, implementation, and evaluation of interventions is an
impactful, innovative, and efficient method for improving the safety, health, and well-being of the U.S.
workforce. With this application, we propose to extend this model in new occupational settings and for new
health challenges to better engage workers in organizational decision-making that advances worker well-being."

10541874,"Abstract
Cancer mortality rates in the US declined by 26% between 1991 and 2015, but the decline has not been equal
across all populations. Approximately 19% of the US population resides in rural areas; for over three decades,
this population has experienced increasingly inferior outcomes when compared with their urban counterparts.
The underlying cause(s) of the widening rural/urban gap in cancer outcomes is hypothesized to be multifactorial,
with socioeconomic status (SES) both at the individual-level and geographic area-level likely playing a significant
role. Gaps in evidence include the use of multiple âruralâ definitions, a lack of evidence on associated geographic
factors, and limited evidence based on multi-level approaches to understand the complex nature of rural
disparities. Therefore, the overall objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive examination of the
underlying causes of rural/urban disparities in mortality among individuals diagnosed with cancer. In the first aim,
the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) population-level data will be used to examine mortality
among individuals diagnosed with cancer across three definitions of rurality, providing researchers and policy
makers with the magnitude of differences by each definition. In the second aim, SEER will be linked via county-
indicators to 16 databases (US Census Bureau, Area Deprivation Index, Bureau of Labor Statistics, County
Health Rankings and Roadmaps, AMA Healthcare Workforce Mapper, BRFSS, Social Vulnerability Index, Health
Information National Trends Survey, etc.). These linkages will allow us to estimate the contribution of specific area-
level factors (e.g., area-level SES, access to high-quality care) on rural/urban mortality differences using effect
decomposition methodology. In the third aim, the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke
(REGARDS) cohort (U01 NS041588) will be linked to state level cancer registry data using the Virtual Pooled
Registry Cancer Linkage System (VPR-CLS). REGARDS includes longitudinally collected data for 30,239
participants (44% blacks), oversampled from stroke belt/buckle states (56% of participants from NC, SC, GA,
TN, AL, MS, AK, LA) with large rural populations experiencing the highest mortality. REGARDS collects
information at the individual level on sociodemographics, health literacy, and distance to healthcare,
transportation, and risky health behaviors. Multi-level modeling and mediation modeling approaches will allow for
the examination of the contribution of individual-level characteristics and the area-level characteristics simultaneously.
Results will provide estimates of how much of the mortality disparity is explained by differences in urban and
rural geographic characteristics overall as well estimates that describe the potential impact of hypothetical
interventions on specific mediating factors. Findings will provide the critical evidence needed to inform policy and
intervention development aimed at addressing the systemic disparities in mortality experienced by rural patients
with cancer."

Primary cilia function is essential for the development of normal left-right asymmetry, kidneys, heart, central
nervous system and many other organs. Current data indicate that the cilium functions as a signal transduction
organelle, compartmentalizing receptor-, adaptor- and downstream transduction mechanisms for multiple
signaling pathways. However, the identity of essential cilia signals and how signals are transduced by the
cilium remains unclear. A complex of four ciliary proteins, inversin, NEK8, ANKS6 and nephrocystin-3
constitutes the so-called ciliary inversin compartment (IC), localized in the proximal portion of the ciliary shaft.
We and others found that the IC is required for cilium function in vertebrates, with mutations in INVS, NEK8,
ANKS6 and NPHP3 all leading to ciliopathy syndromes that include L-/R-asymmetry perturbation, congenital
heart defects and polycystic kidneys. These defects phenocopy the full knockout of PKD2, one of the two
major autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease genes, suggesting that signaling downstream of ADPKD-
and IC-gene products occurs along the same pathway. We found that IC proteins also control ciliary length and
intraflagellar transport (IFT) velocity, processes that require cAMP signaling. Unexpectedly, we find that
nephrocystin-3 acts as a novel GTPase, suggesting a causal link between IC- and cAMP-signaling. In this
grant proposal, we aim to investigate the functional significance of the nephrocystin-3 GTPase mechanism,
defining the catalytic parameters of the enzyme, and interrogating molecular connections among the IC
constituents and to upstream- and downstream signaling factors.
We hypothesize that nephrocystin-3 acts analogous to a stimulatory heterotrimeric G-protein Î±-subunit,
switching its activity state off and on, along a GTP-hydrolysis cycle. In Aim #1, we will investigate nucleotide
affinitiy and -turnover of the purified recombinant nephrocystin-3, along with the pcy allele that affects the
catalytic site, and that gives rise to polycystic kidney disease in mice; compared to GÎ±S. We will test, whether
ciliary G-protein coupled receptors may utilize nephrocystin-3 as a signal adaptor, and whether adenylyl
cyclases may be stimulated by nephrocystin-3, to generate cAMP. In Aim #2, we investigate the molecular
details of the IC assembly hierarchy. We seek to identify what protein domains are necessary to recruit
nephrocystin-3 to its proper localization, to maintain the integrity of the whole complex, and if disease-causing
mutations destabilize the structure. We will ultimately measure ciliary cAMP levels, as a function of IC
manipulations, and test whether deletion or mutation of individual IC proteins change ciliary cAMP levels.
These studies connect ciliopathy gene function to cAMP signaling, thereby addressing outstanding issues in
ciliary biology with important implications for cystic kidney disease pathogenesis. The results will help
identifying druggable enzymatic targets within the IC that may lead to the design of novel therapies."

This application for a Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) would initiate a Center for Pediatric
Brain Health to manage, support, and expand developmental neuroimaging and pediatric neuroscience research
at Boys Town National Research Hospital (BTNRH) in Omaha, Nebraska. It is an opportune moment for pediatric
neuroscience at BTNRH, as an organization-wide initiative to expand in this area has resulted in numerous
faculty hires and the construction of a new state-of-the-art 15,000+ square feet Institute for Human Neuroscience.
The proposed Center for Pediatric Brain Health will organize and support these new resources under a central
umbrella, and provide critical programs to help grow the community and build cohesiveness around a common
theme of pediatric neuroscience and brain health. The key components of the Center include an Administrative
Core, one research core (i.e., the Neural Quantification & Imaging Core), four research project leaders (RPLs),
a Supervisory & Mentoring Committee, and a cohort of established pediatric neuroscientists. Upon initiation of
the Center, the Administrative Core will implement a comprehensive research support structure that includes
mentoring and career developing resources, a pilot projects program, extensive training opportunities, two
distinct seminar series, community outreach, and broad support of key research infrastructure (e.g., participant
registry, shared research spaces). Training opportunities will include technical workshops, as well as internships
and a postdoctoral neuroimaging training program for fostering the next generation of graduate students and
Center faculty. In parallel, the Administrative Core will promote the launch of four RPLs and implement a career
development and evaluation system, which will include a Supervisory & Mentoring Committee comprised of 10
senior scientists who will monitor progress and ensure each RPL and their two co-mentors reach critical
milestones. Finally, the new Neural Quantification & Imaging Core will support and provide direct access to state-
of-the-art instrumentation for pediatric neuroimaging, including a new 3-Tesla Siemens Prisma magnet, two Neo
magnetoencephalographic (MEG) imaging units, a mock MRI scanner, and other major equipment, and will
provide comprehensive analytical support for the most advanced neuroimaging analyses currently available.
Notably, the Core will be the only site in the world to host two MEG Neo systems for quantifying human brain
dynamics. The new Center will also support a cohort of senior scientists with expertise spanning multiple pediatric
populations and different imaging technologies. Finally, the Center will receive exceptional institutional support,
including funds for pilot projects, Core staffing, internships, major equipment expenses, and other initiatives, and
will be directed by Dr. Tony Wilson who is a developmental cognitive neuroscientist with extensive experience
in multimodal neuroimaging and an exceptional track record of extramural support, publications, and mentoring.
Taken together, the expansive resources, support, and expertise within the new Center for Pediatric Brain Health
will ensure that it has a major long-term impact on pediatric neuroscience research at BTNRH and beyond."

Synchronous low-frequency brain activity, as measured by human EEG, has been implicated in both normal
cognition and in disease states such schizophrenia. However, we still do not know whether changes in such
rhythms directly alter neuronal information processing, or are merely epiphenomenal. To address this issue, we
will measure how single and multi unit activity linked to task performance in non-human primates is altered by
endogenous alpha rhythms, and how that activity is changed when alpha rhythms are directly modulated via
closed-loop electrical stimulation. The proposal will offer a mechanistic explanation for the relationship between
alpha rhythms, attention, and perceptual decision making and validate the potential of direct modulation of alpha
rhythms as a therapeutic approach to attentional pathologies."
10640052,"Background: As many as 1.8 million individuals using VA services meet criteria for insomnia disorder, a
condition associated with suicide, poor functioning, and medical and mental health disorders. Cognitive
Behavioral Therapy for insomnia (CBTi) is the gold-standard treatment. However, only a small fraction of
Veterans receive CBTi due to a host of barriers. A digital intervention delivering CBTi, Path to Better Sleep
(PTBS), has been developed by VA specifically for Veterans. PTBS, enhanced by personal coaching, may
mitigate barriers to CBTi by enabling self-management beyond clinic walls.
Significance: Current PTBS dissemination practices consist of inadequate messaging, poor integration into
clinical workflow, and no personal support. Preliminary data indicate that while PTBS has increased access to
CBTi, only an estimated 0.8% of Veterans with insomnia disorder have visited the PTBS site. To address these
gaps, (1) coaching must be integrated with PTBS (Coached PTBS) to increase engagement/adherence and (2)
Coached PTBS must be embedded in current VA care practices using a scalable implementation strategy. The
prevalence of insomnia far outweighs VAâs capacity to deliver gold-standard treatment through any single
modality. An array of treatment options is needed. Moreover, PTBS coaching delivered through a hub-and-
spoke model is a scalable approach to MISSION Act directives mandating evidence-based care in rural areas.
Innovation and Impact: PTBS is the first digital CBTi designed for Veterans. PTBS is open access and meets
stringent VA information security requirements. Coaching integrated into PTBS will increase engagement and
adherence. A hub-and-spoke model of coaching limits reliance on local facility resources. A scalable
implementation strategy for digital interventions, optimized in prior research, will be used. The VISN 1 clinical
trials network allows access to a rural Veteran population and provides research coordination resources.
Specific Aims:
1. [Establish effectiveness of Coached PTBS when implemented in rural-facing VISN 1 facilities]
 H1: Veterans randomized to Coached PTBS will report greater improvement in insomnia severity (primary)
and sleep parameters (secondary) compared to [PTBS + Contact (enhanced treatment as usual control)]
2. Evaluate the quantitative outcomes of REP-DI, the strategy used to embed Coached PTBS in VA care.
 H2: REP-DI will result in adequate Reach among Veterans, Adoption among providers, and Maintenance.
3. Conduct a 3-part formative evaluation of implementation. Interviews with Veterans, providers, and staff will
 be informed by constructs from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Data
 will optimize implementation in real time by tailoring implementation strategy elements to specific contexts.
Methodology: A pragmatic hybrid type-2 effectiveness/implementation mixed-methods trial will be used.
Outpatients with insomnia disorder will be referred by providers and randomized to Coached PTBS or PTBS +
Contact. The implementation strategy will be REP-DI, a scalable and resource efficient strategy for
implementing digital interventions. REP-DI will include provider training and augmentation of site referral
processes to support PTBS implementation. Outcomes will be evaluated according to the RE-AIM framework.
Outcomes include insomnia severity (primary), sleep parameters, fatigue, mood, sedative-hypnotic use, and
other measures collected at baseline, 8 weeks, and 6 months. REP-DI quantitative implementation outcomes
include Reach, Adoption, and Maintenance evaluated at patient and provider/staff levels. A 3-part formative
evaluation employing qualitative methods will identify patient and provider/staff determinants.
Next Steps/Implementation:
Coached PTBS can be implemented across VA using REP-DI by the National Center for Health Promotion and
Disease Prevention and secondary VA partners such as the Offices of Rural Health and Connected Care."
10813840,"Alzheimerâs disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease resulting in dementia, dependence
and healthcare expenditure. Inflammation in the brain (neuroinflammation) shapes the course of
neurodegeneration by impacting neuronal survival through pro-inflammatory (detrimental) as well as anti-
inflammatory (protective) effects. Central nervous system (CNS) mononuclear phagocytes (CNS MPs) are
comprised of CNS-resident microglia and CNS-infiltrating monocytes), and are primary enactors of
neuroinflammation. Selective inhibition of pro-inflammatory CNS MPs in AD may slow down the rate of
neurodegeneration and we have found that blockade of potassium channel Kv1.3 is a promising immune strategy
in AD. Kv1.3 channels regulate calcium flux, are expressed selectively by pro-inflammatory CNS MPs in AD and
their blockade in AD mouse models limits neuropathology. We hypothesize that Kv1.3 channels are key
regulators of immune signaling and survival in pro-inflammatory CNS MPs in AD that can be therapeutically
targeted by selective Kv1.3 blockers. In this proposal, we will tackle three specific questions related to the role
of Kv1.3 channels expressed by pro-inflammatory CNS MPs in AD, with the overall goal of laying the pre-clinical
foundation for future translation of Kv1.3 blockers to humans. First, we will perform in-vivo experiments using
Kv1.3 blockers in the 5xFAD model of AÎ² accumulation to identify immune signaling pathways in CNS MPs that
require Kv1.3 channels (Aim 1a). We will also determine whether blockade of Kv1.3 decreases pro-inflammatory
CNS MPs in the brain by increasing apoptosis and switching them towards anti-inflammatory profiles (Aim 1b).
Next, we will test the hypothesis that CNS MPs expressing high numbers of Kv1.3 channels originate from blood
monocytes, rather than microglia (Aim 2). We will perform transcriptomics of CNS MPs and blood monocytes
and apply the irradiation bone marrow chimera model to determine whether CNS MPs in AD models originate
from microglia or from blood monocytes that infiltrate the brain. In Aim 3, we will perform long-term in-vivo studies
to test the efficacy of Kv1.3 blockers on behavioral and pathological endpoints in two AD mouse models and will
perform mass spectrometry of cerebrospinal fluid to identify protein biomarkers associated with therapeutic
effects of Kv1.3 blockers. Lastly, we will determine the role of CNS MP Kv1.3 channels in AD pathology using a
conditional deletion genetic approach in AD models. To achieve the aims of this R01 proposal, we have
assembled a multi-disciplinary team of investigators with expertise in neuro-immunology, Kv1.3 biology and
mouse models of neurodegeneration (Dr. Rangaraju, PI), immune signaling (Dr Wood), mass spectrometry and
biomarker discovery (Drs Seyfried and Levey) as well as small-molecule pharmacology (Drs. Wulff)."
10549839,"The prevalence of diabetes has reached epidemic proportions in the United States, gravely afflicting patients and burdening societies with productivity loss and health care costs. Diabetes is characterized by a reduction in beta cell mass in the pancreas, or a failure of beta cells to secrete enough insulin to fully compensate for insulin resistance. Augmenting or preserving functional beta cell mass is an attractive objective for preventing or treating diabetes; however, we have insufficient intervention targets. The long-term goal of our research is to better understand how intestinal lipid processing controls systemic metabolism and explore intervention targets to combat metabolic diseases. We have reported that acyl CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (MGAT2) mediates intestinal fat absorption and regulates systemic energy balance. Although mice lacking a functional MGAT2 gene (Mogat2â/â) or lacking MGAT2 specifically in the intestine absorb normal amounts of dietary fat, they exhibit delayed fat absorption, increased energy expenditure, and resistance to obesity and related disorders. Intriguingly, we found that loss of MGAT2 protects mice against chemically- and genetically-induced diabetes by preserving functional beta cell mass. Associated with the protection, Mogat2â/â mice have increased plasma bile acids, known to have potent metabolic effects as ligands for membrane and nuclear receptors that regulate metabolism. Further, increasing plasma bile acids â by feeding mice ursodeoxycholic acid, treating mice with broad-spectrum antibiotics, or raising mice germ-freeâ is sufficient to protect functional beta cell mass against the beta-cell toxin, streptozotocin. Intriguingly, we also found reduced bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity in cecum, where most gut microbiota reside, and increased GLP1 in pancreatic alpha-cells. To understand the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying MGAT2 deficiency-mediated protection, we propose here to rigorously test our overarching hypothesis that that loss of intestinal MGAT2 (1) decreases microbial BSH activity, which (2) enhances reabsorption through the apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter (ASBT), leading to (3) increased GLP1 secretion from pancreatic a-cells that induces GLP1 receptor (GLP1r)-signaling in b-cells, and thereby protects pancreatic islet function. In Aim 1, we will determine if a reduction in BSH activity is necessary and/or sufficient to increase plasma bile acids and protect mice again beta cell insults. In Aim 2, we will determine if loss of MGAT2 enhances re-absorption of bile acids and if the process requires ASBT. In Aim 3, we will determine if GLP1 produced in alpha cells and if GLP1 receptors on beta cells are required for the effects of MGAT2 deficiency. Our proposed work represents essential steps to elucidate novel pathways that link intestinal lipid processing and bile acid metabolism with pancreatic islet function. Our findings will describe a novel example of interorgan communication that controls systemic metabolism setting the stage for targeting MGAT2 inhibition to combat diabetes by decreasing bacterial bile salt hydrolase, increasing conjugated primary bile acids, and modulating intra-islet signaling."
10543830,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Young children are dependent on their parents to create family environments that support healthy weight, yet
many parents do not consistently parent in ways that protect their children from obesity. Further, several
interventions to improve parenting as a means to address early childhood obesity have struggled with parent
engagement and adherence. In adults, poor self-regulation, or limitations in an individuals' capacity to regulate
emotions, thoughts, and behavior, is a robust, yet modifiable, risk factor for obesity. Poor self-regulation may
similarly interfere with parents' ability to parent in ways that support their children's healthy weight, but there
are no robust data to directly support this conjecture. Further, while improving children's self-regulation has
been identified as a promising method to address childhood obesity, we do not currently understand how
parent and child self-regulation work together to impact children's growth. This lack of information precludes us
from identifying whether targeting child self-regulation alone, parent self-regulation alone, or both together,
may be the most effective means to prevent or treat childhood obesity. Our long-term goal is to identify
strategies to sustainably improve parents' use of practices that support children's healthy weight. The objective
of this study is to identify the interrelationships between mothers' self-regulation, their weight-related parenting
practices, child self-regulation, and child adiposity from ages 3 through 5, a critical period for preventing the
onset of long-term obesity. Our central hypothesis is that poor self-regulation impedes mothers' engagement in
parenting practices that support children's healthy weight, leading to excessive gains in adiposity among young
children. We also expect that in families where both mothers and children have poor self-regulation, mothers
have even greater difficulty engaging in effective weight-related parenting, and children will experience the
most rapid gains in adiposity. To test this central hypothesis, we will conduct a prospective cohort study
enrolling a socio-demographically diverse sample of 300 mother/child dyads, collecting data 3 times over 2.5
years to address the following specific aims: (1) Identify relationships between mothers' self-regulation and
weight-related parenting practices, (2) Identify relationships between mothers' self-regulation and changes in
child adiposity, and (3) Identify how child self-regulation modifies relationships between mothers' self-
regulation, weight-related parenting, and child adiposity. This project is conceptually innovative in its focus on
mothers' self-regulation, its recognition of the dyadic interactions between mothers and children, and the use of
rigorous methods to measure self-regulation and parenting. This research is significant because it will elucidate
when, how, and among whom deficits in mothers' self-regulation contribute to their young children's obesity
risk. There are known strategies to improve self-regulation and enhance behavior change among adults with
poor self-regulation. Findings will provide essential guidance for the development of novel intervention
approaches to target mothers' self-regulation as a mechanism to prevent and treat childhood obesity."

In recent large-scale genome-wide analysis studies, a rare coding variant was identified in Abelson interactor
family member 3 (ABI3) gene and this variant is associated with increased risk of late-onset Alzheimerâs disease
(LOAD). ABI3 is highly conserved across multiple species, including humans and mice. Interestingly, it is highly
expressed in microglia and relatively more abundant in the hippocampus, compared to the other brain regions.
The overarching goal of this application is to understand the role of ABI3 in microglia function and the
mechanisms by which ABI3 affects the pathogenesis of AD. We propose the following Specific Aims to test our
hypotheses. In Aim 1, we will determine the effect of Abi3 deletion on Alzheimerâs disease pathology using two
mouse models. By performing unbiased transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, we will identify the potential key
regulators of Abi3-mediated effects. We will conduct further functional and biochemical experiments to dissect
the mechanism based on these findings. In Aim 2, we will investigate the effect of the ABI3 rare coding variant
on AD pathology using ABI3 knock-in mouse model. We will perform brain imaging and electrophysiology
experiments to assess the functional effects of ABI3 risk variant. In addition, we will assess neuropathological
phenotypes in the brains. To identify the potential pathways and key regulators, we will analyze transcriptome
and proteome altered by ABI3 knockout and knock-in. In Aim 3, we will perform microglial cellular assays to
determine the effects of ABI3 risk variant on microglia functions. Furthermore, we will use RNA interference
approach to knock-down the genes of our interest to dissect the mechanism behind the ABI3 risk variant-
mediated changes. The successful completion of this study will provide novel insights into the mechanisms of
AD, in particular, microglial functions mediated by Abi3. Our long-term goal is to identify new druggable targets
for the effective treatment of AD."
10478921,"Quality of life following surgery is critically important to Veterans, their families, and the VA Healthcare
Systemâespecially for frail patients who are less likely to be discharged to home, more likely to be readmitted
within 30 days, and have substantially increased rates of postoperative mortality and complications. A
substantial survival benefit occurs for frail patients when surgeons preoperatively screen for frailty and adjust
treatment plans accordingly. Although survival is an important outcome for frail patients, many prioritize quality
of life based on preservation of independence. Yet data about long-term independence after surgery is lacking
because surgical registries focus on 30-day outcomes and typically do not assess functional status or other
more patient-centered quality measures. Discharge rates to skilled nursing facilities after major surgery range
from 30% to 40% for frail patients living at home preoperatively, but this is not unexpected as they are likely to
benefit from short-term rehabilitation. However, critical knowledge gaps exist regarding (a) whether these
patients regain their independence or remain institutionalized; and (b) how to effectively communicate those
perioperative risks to support shared decisions about surgical treatment aligned with patients' values.
 Postoperative Loss of Independence (LOI) is a critically important, but difficult to measure patient-centered
outcome, encompassing a broad range of activities important to patients. Here we narrowly define LOI as the
number of days living elsewhere than home after presenting from home for the index surgery. LOI may resolve
quickly (i.e., short-term LOI) or become protracted/permanent (i.e., long-term LOI). Risk factors for long-term
LOI are unknown, but likely include frailty, emergency surgery, and procedures that impose high physiological
stress. Prognosis regarding potential LOI is essential for surgeons and patients to make better-informed
decisions about surgical treatment that align with patients' goals and values. Specifically, we aim to:
Aim 1: Characterize common trajectories of postoperative LOI in the 365 days after surgery to describe
clinically meaningful heterogeneity in the patterns of healthcare utilization and their associations with frailty,
emergency surgery, and operative stress. In a large Veteran sample, we will quantify the setting and duration
of healthcare utilization in the year following surgery, modeling trajectories of LOI and associated risk factors.
We hypothesize that LOI will be more common among the frail and after both emergency and high-stress
surgery.
Aim 2: Adapt the Risk Analysis Index (RAI) to predict long-term LOI and explore alternative models for LOI
prediction. The RAI is a 14-item survey measure of surgical frailty that requires 30 seconds to administer at the
point-of-care and predicts postoperative mortality and complications. We will adapt the RAI to build, calibrate,
and validate models predicting long-term LOI and explore alternative models predicting LOI using variables in
the Electronic Health Record and existing risk measures. We hypothesize that item responses from the RAI
can accurately predict LOI at the point of care.
Aim 3: Explore key stakeholders' perspectives on how LOI risk prognosis might better align shared decisions
about surgical treatment with patients' values and goals. We will conduct focus groups with surgeons and
semi-structured interviews with patients and their caregivers to explore perspectives on perioperative risks and
strategies for aligning shared decisions with patients' values. Research will focus on the factors surgeons,
patients, and their informal caregivers consider when making surgical treatment decisions, the relative
importance of LOI prognosis in this context, and how the risk of LOI can be best communicated and
operationally implemented to inform and improve preference-sensitive surgical choices."

10604304,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The objective of this academic-industrial partnership (AIP) project is to demonstrate the utility of dedicated
breast positron emission tomography (dbPET) for characterizing primary breast cancers and their response to
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). While dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI)
depicts changes in tumor morphology and vascularity in response to NAC, dbPET provides complementary
information about tumor metabolism that can powerfully predict treatment response earlier in the course of
therapy. We focus this project on MAMMI dbPET by OncoVision because it provides the crucial combination
of high spatial resolution and sensitivity that can enable accurate intratumoral mapping of metabolic changes in
small lesions with only half the radiotracer dose of whole-body PET. Importantly, this new system scales PET
technology to be both economically and clinically feasible in the early (pre-metastatic) breast cancer setting. As
the imaging lead (PI: Nola Hylton) of the I-SPY 2 TRIAL, a clinical trial designed to identify novel therapeutics
for breast cancer, we are in a unique position to integrate and test the performance of FDG-dbPET as an early
marker for treatment response. As academic-industrial partners, UCSF and OncoVision will work together to
develop a user-friendly and cost-effective dbPET technology that can be easily adopted into the clinical
workflow of most breast cancer centers. In Specific Aim 1, we will develop software capabilities to standardize
dbPET image registration and quantification to accurately quantify longitudinal changes with treatment. In
Specific Aim 2, we will acquire pre- and post-treatment FDG-dbPET images of a subset of I-SPY 2 patients
and clinically evaluate whether tumor metabolic metrics (i.e., optimized standardized uptake values, SUV) from
dbPET can act as early predictors of pathologic complete response â in comparison to, and in combination
with, the functional tumor volume (FTV) metric from DCE-MRI. We will test the biomarker performance of
dbPET SUV and combined SUV+FTV using logistic regression predictive models. We will also explore the
association of dbPET and DCE-MRI radiomic features with breast cancer biomarkers in order to identify
imaging features with prognostic value. In addition, our prospective studyâs dbPET data will be used to

imaging biomarkers relevant to tumor biology and its change in response to treatment."

Alzheimerâs disease (AD) gene-risk data, epidemiological findings and animal models converge
to indicate the critical role of inflammation for the onset and progression of AD. Inflammation
could provide a new focus for therapeutic intervention. However, inflammation biomarkers are
poorly characterized in AD. In this project, we will measure blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
inflammation biomarkers and compare them to measurements of brain glial activation obtained
by positron emission tomography (PET). In addition, we will determine the effect of low-dose
interleukin-2 (IL-2) immunotherapy, given over 22 weeks, on these inflammation biomarkers.
For this purpose, we will measure these biomarkers in AD individuals enrolled in a phase 2a
safety and efficacy trial of low-dose IL-2 therapy. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a
neuroprotective role by suppressing inflammation in the blood and the brain. We have shown
that Treg immunomodulatory mechanisms are compromised in AD patients, resulting in
activation of pro-inflammatory monocytes and upregulation of inflammatory mediators. In a
Phase 1 clinical study, we showed that IL-2 administration induced Treg expansion and
restoration; the therapy was safe, and it was associated with improved cognition. Supported by
a âPart-the-Cloudâ grant from the Alzheimerâs Association, we will conduct a follow up phase 2a
study which includes the measurement of cognition, as well as CSF T-tau, P-tau, AÎ²42, and
neurofilament light chain (NFL) before and after 22 weeks of IL-2 treatment in the subjects with
mild to moderate AD. Taking advantage of this novel trial, and by evaluating the 40 AD patients
participating in it, the current study will investigate systemic and central nervous system
(CNS) biomarkers of inflammation and their modulation by IL-2 administration. We will
analyze the impact of IL-2 immunotherapy on peripheral immune biomarkers (Aim 1) as well as
CNS inflammation, measured through CSF inflammation biomarkers (Aim 2) and brain
inflammation positron emission tomography (Aim 3). To determine which blood biomarkers
correlate best with central nervous system biomarkers (Aim 4), the associations among blood,
CSF, and brain imaging measures of neuroinflammation before and after IL-2 therapy will be
determined. Our novel approach will explore the potential link between systemic and CNS
inflammation in AD clinical setting and advance the use of inflammatory biomarkers in AD anti-
inflammatory clinical trials."

 Human health can be inextricably linked to our understanding of bats, as bats are known or predicted
reservoirs for the precursors of many zoonotic viruses. Unfortunately, we still know little about bat immunology,
and we do not know what characteristics allow them to survive with the same viruses that can readily kill other
hosts such as humans. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that bats are an incredibly diverse order of
mammals, so what we learn about the immunological mechanisms of one bat species may not be true for
another. We need new techniques and technologies to efficiently explore the vast unknown universe of
immunological mechanisms that exist across diverse bats. In this application, we propose to develop key tools
needed to functionally characterize the genetic underpinnings of bat immunology. In the first aim, we propose
to pair modern advances in recombinant DNA synthesis and cell engineering to more comprehensively
investigate the function of orthologous genes already proposed to be important in bat immune homeostasis.
We will focus our investigations on STING, a key node in the cytoplasmic nucleic acid sensing pathway. We
will characterize a dozen diverse STING orthologs across Chiroptera to determine whether the same
regulatory mechanisms exist across the order, or if multiple distinct regulatory mechanisms exist. We will
narrow down the genetic determinants underlying these mechanisms by developing and applying âchimeric
mutational scanningâ, where we will create libraries of human-bat STING chimeras to identify the key residues
that confer bat-specific regulation to signaling. In the second aim, we will shift our focus to identifying
previously unappreciated immune genes and pathways present in bats. We will perform this with an unbiased
transposon mutagenesis approach, which will be applied to cell lines from diverse bat species. Selection and
sequencing of mutagenized bat cells resistant to the cytopathic effects of Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV)
replication, a proxy for rabies virus, will reveal innate immune genes that allow bats to survive infection. The
mutagenized cells will also be exposed to VSV-EboGP (VSV pseudotyped with the Ebola virus glycoprotein),
mimicking the mechanism used by Ebola virus to enter cells. Thus, with little extra effort, the same library will
be used to identify bat innate immune genes that confer resistance to two zoonotic viruses thought to use bats
as an animal reservoir. This work will both create the technologies needed to explore and understand the
unknown aspects of bat immunity, and generate biological findings directly improving our understanding of bat
innate immune mechanisms. These complementary approaches span a wide field of scope, from the functional
interrogation of the importances of individual amino acids within known innate immune genes, to the whole
genome level to highlight additional genes that should be the subject of focused investigation in the future."
10770982,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Adipose expansion is necessary to accommodate chronic excess caloric intake and characterized by an
increase in adipocyte size (hypertrophy) and number (hyperplasia; adipogenesis). Though obesity is related to
AT lipid handling and storage capacity, the mechanisms underlying the link between obesity and the metabolic
syndrome (MetS) are poorly understood. The AT expandability hypothesis postulates that the capacity for
subcutaneous (subQ) adipose expansion is a significant determinant of metabolic health, as impaired
adipogenesis (limited hyperplasia) may lead to ectopic lipid deposition in non-adipose organs, contributing to the
development of obesity-associated diseases. Some in vitro studies report a higher population of small fat cells
(i.e. hyperplasia) in individuals with MetS and type 2 diabetes. Data from two human overfeeding studies (one
from our group) demonstrate that a smaller adipocyte size resulted in a greater impairment of insulin sensitivity
with weight gain. We are the only group to assess in vivo adipogenesis in subQ AT via the incorporation of
deuterium (2H) into adipose cells of obese women and show that higher adipocyte formation was associated with
facets of impaired metabolic health. Our findings and others are contrary to the AT expandability hypothesis and
provide evidence that higher (not lower) adipogenesis (i.e. hyperplasia) is associated with obesity-related
disorders. Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we will examine the effects of a 9-week intervention on
mechanisms of AT expandability. Overweight men and women will be randomized to 30% overfeeding (OF) or
a weight stable Control (CTL) group. The objectives of the proposal are to test in vivo adipogenesis, using a
validated 2H-labeling approach, and other mechanisms of subQ AT expansion in response to weight gain, and
to assess the relationship of adipose expansion with changes in metabolic outcomes. The primary hypothesis is
that higher adipogenesis in response to OF will be accompanied by increased visceral adiposity and ectopic
lipid, reduced insulin sensitivity, and pathological AT remodeling in individuals with impaired subQ AT expansion.
Therefore, despite hyperplasia in weight gainers, a limited storage capacity of adipocytes may facilitate impaired
health outcomes. This is the first RCT to test the validity of the `AT expandability hypothesis'. Findings will provide
new knowledge on the influence of adipose characteristics on the metabolic responses to dynamic changes in
weight in humans."

10760210,"Project Summary
Tyrosine O-sulfation, i.e., transfer of a sulfonate group to tyrosine amino acid residues in proteins, is a
widespread posttranslational modification (PTM) in eukaryotic cells with a variety of known functions in health
and disease, including receptor binding, viral replication, inflammation, and retinal function. The enzymes that
catalyze tyrosine sulfation are located in the Golgi apparatus. The function of this organelle is to ensure that
correct protein modification occurs and to package proteins into vesicles for export to the cell surface, or the
extracellular environment. Because proteins must typically enter the Golgi to become sulfated, most known
sulfoproteins are secreted proteins or membrane proteins. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful tool for global
PTM analysis in cells and tissues; however, large scale analysis of tyrosine O-sulfation has not been feasible,
due in part to its labile nature in the gas-phase environment of a mass spectrometer, and in part due to the lack
of appropriate data analysis strategies. In MS experiments, proteins are typically digested into smaller peptides,
which are ionized, detected, and fragmented to deduce sequence information. When measuring protein
phosphorylation, another rather labile PTM known to regulate Golgi disassembly and reassembly during cell
division, in interphase vs. mitotic Golgi, we found that tyrosine O-sulfation was co-enriched. This discovery is
not surprising because the chemical properties of sulfation (O-SO3) are similar to phosphorylation (O-PO3H).
However; high mass accuracy measurements are required to deduce the small mass difference of 0.0095 Da
between these two PTMs. Even as such high performance measurements are becoming more routine, standard
database search tools typically do not identify protein sulfation because this PTM is completely lost during
analysis. We found that open database searching was able to overcome this problem and, thus, we were able
to accomplish identification of a number of novel sulfoproteins in rat liver Golgi. While an exciting advance, the
exact location of O-sulfation within proteolytic peptides could not be directly measured. In Aim 1 of this proposal,
we seek to develop improved methods for detection of intact sulfopeptides by MS, including elimination of
competing phosphorylation, determination of peptide sequence effects, implementation of stabilizing adducts,
and conditions that selectively dissociate sulfopeptides. To further allow sulfate site localization, in Aim 2, we
seek to develop technologies for fragmenting sulfopeptides while retaining sulfate in fragment ions. These
approaches include negative ion mode free radical initiated peptide sequencing, which allows sulfopeptides to
enter the mass spectrometer as more stable anions, and the development of âsmartâ data acquisition strategies
for improved electron transfer dissociation. The final Aim 3 seeks to apply these improved approaches for
comprehensive analysis of the Golgi sulfoproteome in cells and animal tissue, particularly under perturbed Golgi
conditions, which are expected to alter sulfation. These types of measurements will provide transformative
information regarding the regulatory roles of tyrosine sulfation and its impact on cellular function."

The main objective of this grant is to use genetically engineered mouse models to determine how
genetic changes in human chymotrypsin increase risk for chronic pancreatitis. Previous studies
demonstrated the protective role of chymotrypsin against pancreatitis in humans and in mouse models.
In this proposal, the overarching hypothesis is that loss of protective chymotrypsin function leads to
pancreatitis in the context of additional genetic or environmental risk factors that facilitate
intrapancreatic trypsin activation. To prove this notion, a CTRB1-deleted mouse strain (Ctrb1-del) will
be crossed with mice carrying various pancreatitis risk alleles or will be exposed to an alcohol diet.
Although CTRB1-deleted mice show heightened pancreatitis responses when disease is induced
experimentally by cerulein stimulation; they do not develop pancreatitis naturally. Introduction of
additional risk factors in the setting of chymotrypsin deficiency is predicted to result in the spontaneous
onset and progression of pancreatitis. Alternatively, mice will exhibit additive susceptibility to cerulein-
induced pancreatitis. The following specific aims will be studied. (1) Chymotrypsin deficiency synergizes
with trypsinogen mutations to cause pancreatitis. In this aim, the hypothesis is that mice deficient in
chymotrypsin and carrying mutations in mouse cationic trypsinogen (isoform T7) will develop
spontaneous acute pancreatitis that will progress to chronic pancreatitis. Alternatively, mice will exhibit
increased susceptibility to cerulein-induced pancreatitis. Adjusting gene dosage through combinations
of heterozygous and homozygous alleles should result in variations in age of onset and/or severity. (2)
Combined insufficiency of chymotrypsin and trypsin inhibitor in pancreatitis. In this aim, Ctrb1-del mice
will be crossed either with a SPINK1-deleted strain (Spink1-KO) or with mice carrying a T7 trypsinogen
allele with the p.G199R mutation, which conveys inhibitor-degrading properties (functional ortholog of
human mesotrypsin). The hypothesis is that mice with combined deficiency in chymotrypsin and trypsin
inhibitor will develop either spontaneous pancreatitis or will exhibit increased severity of cerulein-
induced pancreatitis. (3) Alcoholic pancreatitis in the setting of chymotrypsin deficiency. In this aim,
chymotrypsin-deficient mice will be fed the Lieber-DeCarli alcohol liquid diet. The hypothesis is that in
the background of chymotrypsin-deficiency alcohol will cause spontaneous pancreatitis through
selective upregulation of trypsinogen. Successful completion of these aims will offer conclusive
evidence that alterations in chymotrypsin genes in humans promote the development of pancreatitis by
interacting with other genetic and environmental factors that increase intrapancreatic trypsin activity."
10595507,"Background: Almost 40% of Veterans using the Veterans Health Administration (VA) have obesity, putting
millions at risk for costly and debilitating conditions, including diabetes, cancer, and severe COVID-19. VA
weight management programs effectively reduce weight, morbidity, and mortality. For example, MOVE!, VAâs
flagship program for weight management is associated with reductions in cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
However, while 94% of eligible Veterans are offered weight management programs, less than 8% use them.
 Motivational interviewing improves treatment engagement, but clinicians have limited time to apply it.
Therefore, we developed EMBER, a self-directed tool with the goal of Enhancing Motivation for Better
Engagement and Reach for weight management. It is available in paper and digital formats. EMBER is not a
weight management program, instead it engages Veterans in existing programs by informing and guiding
choices about weight management. EMBER is the product of an HSR&D Career Development Award (15-257).
Significance: If EMBER increases engagement in effective weight management programs, it has the potential
to help Veterans lose weight, thereby improving health and quality of life for thousands of patients. As a result,
we address many HSR&D priorities, e.g.,
access to care, virtual care, healthy equity, & primary care.
Innovation & Impact: EMBER is the first self-directed, motivational interviewing-based intervention designed
to increase Veteran engagement in weight management programs. As opposed to a âone-offâ study in a
specific population, the proposed work takes a novel, low-touch population health approach that could be
translated to other programs (e.g., behavioral pain management). EMBER also includes vignettes relevant to
populations at high risk for obesity (e.g., women, people of color).
Further, t
he Hybrid Type 1 design will ensure
results can be scaled and sustained while also advancing implementation science. As such, the proposed work
will: 1) advance the science of engagement in behavioral health programs and 2) facilitate future research on
the implementation of EMBER and similar interventions.
Specific Aims:
1. Assess whether Veterans randomized to EMBER are more likely to have any weight management
engagement at 2-month follow-up (per administrative data supplemented with self-report) compared to
 those randomized to the control arm (information sheet listing available programs). (Primary Outcome)
2. Assess whether Veterans randomized to EMBER have greater weight management program retention,
weight management behaviors (e.g., physical activity), weight loss, and quality of life gains at 6-month
 follow-up compared to those randomized to the control arm. (Secondary Outcomes)
3. Assess factors likely to affect EMBERâs implementation. Preliminary implementation outcomes will be
assessed via RE-AIM4 (Reach, Effectiveness, Implementation) and the Proctor et al.5 implementation
outcomes framework (Acceptability, Appropriateness, Costs, Fidelity). (Implementation Outcomes)
Randomized two site Hybrid Type 1 Effectiveness-Implementation Trial among Veteran primary
care patients with obesity in VA (N=470). Participants will be randomized to EMBER or a control condition
consisting of a list of available weight management programs. The primary outcome is any weight
management engagement 2-months after baseline. Aims 1 and 2 will use self-report and administrative data to
assess intervention outcomes. Aim 3 will use patient data and information from research staff.
Methodology:
Implementation/Next Steps: If effective, we will use implementation strategies suggested by Aim 3 to ensure
Veterans receive EMBER. We will test these strategies in a Hybrid Type 2 trial to understand EMBERâs
effectiveness in real world contexts and best practices for dissemination and implementation of EMBER and
similar interventions."
10764209,"ABSTRACT
Over the past 20 years, the prevalence of obesity in the United States and worldwide has reached epidemic
proportions. Obesity is a very powerful health determinant that facilitates the development and progression of
several metabolic diseases, insulin resistance and chronic inflammation. High fat diet (HFD) consumption
positively correlates with development of obesity. T cells infiltrate adipose tissue during the early development
of obesity (prior to macrophage influx) and are strongly implicated in the initiation of inflammation associated
with obesity. In both humans and mice, macrophage abundance increases in obese adipose tissue and can
develop either M1 (pro-inflammatory) or M2 (anti-inflammatory) phenotypes. During obesity progression
differential expression of microRNAs (miRs) by naive and activated T cells suggests their importance in T cell
effector (Teff) functions. Further, it is well established that miRs extensively regulate adipocyte development and
function. We noticed T cell homeostatic expansion and changes in macrophage abundance and phenotype in
adipose tissue of HFD fed mice compared to those fed a normal diet (ND). Specifically, our preliminary data
indicates that HFD downregulates adipose resident T cell miRs-10a, -125b and -1247 and mimics miRs' in-vivo
reversal of the expression of metabolic markers associated with obesity and modulates macrophage abundance.
Based on strong rigor and preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that T cell miRs-10a, -125b and 1247 are
essential for regulating crosstalk between adipocytes, T cells and macrophages during diet-induced
obesity. To support this premise, we will test whether adipose T cell miRs play a crucial role in diet-induced
obesity (DIO) (Aim 1); identify the mechanisms by which T cell miRs are downregulated in DIO (Aim 2); determine
whether adipose T cell miRs mediate macrophage function in DIO (Aim 3). For the first time, we will explore
how resident adipose tissue-derived T cell miRs alter metabolic function and obesity. Testing this hypothesis will
provide an enhanced understanding on interactions between T cell miRs, T cell expansion, and macrophage
and adipocyte function in the adipose tissue microenvironment that may allow for effective prevention and
treatment options for obesity and metabolic dysfunction."

United States military Veterans from recent conflicts are coping with symptoms related to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Many Veterans are resistant to conventional health and mental health interventions (e.g., medication, psychotherapy), and often symptoms are not significantly improved by traditional treatments. Alternative treatment methods are needed. An underlying feature of PTSD is exaggerated inflammation, both peripherally and in the central nervous system, which is thought to play an important role in the vulnerability to, aggravation of, and perpetuation of adverse consequences of this condition. Therefore, an innovative intervention strategy would be the use of anti-inflammatory/immunoregulatory probiotics to reduce inflammation. In this study, we will investigate the effects of an 8-week oral administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG; ATCC53103), a probiotic shown to have anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects on both biological signatures of systemic inflammatory processes and proximal signatures of probiotic administration. LGG is a commensal organism that colonizes the human gut mucosa and suppresses mucosal inflammation via inhibition of the production of proinflammatory cytokines. The specific aim of the study is to identify the effect of probiotics on systemic inflammation, as well as PTSD symptoms, microbiota composition, gut permeability, stress response, and decision-making. Outcomes will be assessed using a longitudinal, double blind, randomized placebo-controlled design. After initial evaluation procedures to confirm PTSD and Functional Bowel Disorder diagnoses, 59 participants will be randomized to probiotic supplementation and 59 will be randomized to placebo supplementation. The proposed line of research addresses the NIH funding opportunity purpose, âto accelerate translational and clinical Phase IIaâ trials regarding âprobiotic[s]â to increase âunderstanding regarding underlying mechanisms of their action(s), and variability in responses to these interventionsâ. Long-term, this study may lead to a paradigm shift in the manner by which we target clinical symptoms associated with PTSD by beginning the process of supporting a multitargeted, neuroprotective approach."

10749002,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
 Despite suppression by antiretroviral therapy (ART), virus is not eliminated in HIV patients and can
rebound causing full-blown infection upon ART interruption. Thus, a strategy to eliminate the virus reservoir is
urgently needed. The recently discovered gene editing technique called CRISPR has tremendous potential for
eradicating HIV-1. CRISPR is comprised of a Cas9 nuclease and chimeric guide RNA (gRNA). When Cas9
and gRNA designed to target HIV sequences are present in latently-infected cells, it can result in disruption of
the integrated proviral genome, permanently inactivating the virus. The biggest challenge to using the CRISPR
approach for HIV elimination is the absence of an in vivo delivery system for human T cells, the major cellular
of HIV-1.
 This is a R01 application in response to RFA-AI-18-016, âTargeted In Vivo Delivery of Gene
Therapeutics for HIV Cureâ. To address the challenge of Cas9/gRNA delivery to human T cells in vivo, we
propose the use of a T cell-targeting lentivirus whose tropism is guided by antibodies to human CD7, a
molecule expressed at high levels on all human T cells, including resting T cells which are a major reservoir for
latent HIV. To address concerns of vector integration and constitutive Cas9 expression, we have generated
lentiviruses that are pre-packaged with Cas9 ribonucleoproteins with no integrating DNA components. Proof-
of-concept studies in virologically-suppressed HIV-infected humanized mice demonstrate that disrupting
CCR5, the coreceptor for HIV-1, with this systemic approach results in ART-free virologic remission.
Importantly, as the approach does not require activation or elimination of the infected cell, it addresses the
limitations of conventional `Shock and Kill' approaches that have yielded promising results in clinical settings.
The proposal has three specific aims-
In Specific Aim 1, we will design and test broad-spectrum gRNAs targeting HIV DNA in two independent
approaches expected to mutate a segment or excise the entire length of the integrated HIV provirus. The
approach will be tested in ART-suppressed humanized mice for impact on virus reservoir and rebound. A
comprehensive investigation of toxicity, off-target effects and virus escape will also be undertaken. In Specific
Aim 2, we will perform functional studies in patient-cell derived humanized mice to determine the effects of
broad-spectrum gRNAs on latent virus quasispecies from HIV+ patients. The studies will employ HIV-1 RNA
Sort-Seq, a novel methodology to quantitate the inducible replication-competent HIV reservoir. In Specific Aim
3, we incorporate strategic changes in the lentiviral vector to reduce vector-associated immunogenicity and
permit a single or multiple but rapid-dosing regimen with enhanced potency.
 The outcome of these proof-of-principle studies is expected to establish a solid platform for future
studies on an approach that could significantly contribute towards a cure for HIV-AIDS."

Untreated opioid use disorder (OUD) is a continuing public health emergency in the United States. OUD is
associated with significant morbidity and mortality, including overdose death. Buprenorphine is an effective
treatment for OUD, but most individuals who need such treatment do not access it.
Public STD clinics are high-volume, episodic care medical settings that serve a high-risk population, often on a
walk-in basis. STD clinic patients have high prevalence of OUD and health-risking behaviors.
This proposed study, entitled Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Linkage at STD Clinics using Buprenorphine
(OUTLAST-B), will examine OUD treatment linkage strategies for opioid-dependent patients seeking services
at public STD clinics. This three-arm, parallel randomized clinical trial (RCT) will compare Usual Care (UC), vs.
referral via Patient Navigation (PN), vs. Patient Navigation with STD-clinic initiated buprenorphine (PN+BUP).
The UC Arm will include standard services at the STD clinic. The PN Arm will include all UC Arm services,
with the addition of a Patient Navigator who will assist the participant in selecting a community OUD treatment
program, facilitate an intake appointment, help to resolve barriers and coordinate OUD treatment entry, and
support early retention in OUD treatment. The PN+BUP Arm will include all PN Arm services, with the addition
of meeting with the STD clinicâs buprenorphine-waivered provider (typically a nurse practitioner) to initiate
buprenorphine treatment, as a bridge until successful transfer to OUD treatment in the community.
Research assessments consisting of a structured interview battery and biomarkers for drug use and STDs will
be conducted at baseline, 3-, and 6-month follow-up. Selected outcomes will be examined through 12-months
via health record linkage methods. The study will examine participant outcomes in the domains of: (1) OUD
treatment entry and retention, (2) Opioid use and related problems (including fatal and non-fatal overdose),
and (3) HIV/STD-related outcomes.
This innovative study could identify new approaches to engaging a high-risk patient population in OUD
treatment. The study could have high impact because findings could be scaled to STD clinics throughout the
nation, spurring novel integration across two traditionally separate service sectors of STD care and OUD
treatment."

for the proposed 12 week program for 4 summer veterinary student trainee slots / year for the first two years, to
expand to 6 slots / year for the final three years. The proposed T35 Scholars Program will complement and
integrate into our existing summer programs that have >90% success in preparing veterinary students for
research-intensive careers. Through the establishment of a T35 Scholar Program at JHU DMCP, we hope to
offer an outstanding opportunity for veterinary students to learn about and prepare themselves to be future
veterinarian-scientists as well as leaders in biomedical research."

The goal of this R01 application is to examine time trends for incident fall injuries in Medicare, including non-
fracture fall injuries (NFFI) and fractures, across 20 years of cohort data and if changes in risk factors explains
trends, and then to evaluate major geriatric outcomes subsequent to incident NFFI. Unlike osteoporotic
fracture, NFFI - defined as fall injuries without fracture - are not treated as hallmarks of geriatric decline,
particularly if the presenting injury is not severe (e.g., soft tissue injury). Our preliminary data found fall
mortality in older adults increased substantially over the past several decades, with higher increases for the
oldest cohorts. We will evaluate if this trend in fall mortality extends to non-fatal medically treated fall injuries
over 20 years in several combined epidemiologic cohorts of older adults with overlapping time periods from
1998-2019. The Specific Aims are: 1) To examine time trends for incident fall injuries in Medicare, including
NFFI and fractures, across 20 years of cohort data and if changes in risk factors over the time period explains
trends; and 2) To determine if incident NFFI predict future inpatient hospitalizations, increased risk of SNF
stays and mortality for up to 5 years after NFFI in women and men. In 4 pooled longitudinal cohorts (61%
women, 33% minorities, 36% aged >80 years, 27% obese) with in-person exams of 4,653 men and 7,338
women, incident fall injuries will be identified from 5-10 years of self-reported questions and Medicare Fee for
Service (FFS) Parts A and B claims. We hypothesize fall injury incidence will increase over time in the
combined cohort of nearly 12,000 women and men, with increases higher at the oldest ages, and that overall
fall injury incidence and NFFI incidence increases will be partially explained by risk factors of metabolic (e.g.,
obesity, diabetes, blood pressure) and neuromuscular function (strength, gait speed, chair stand speed) that
we have identified in past work as novel risk factors for NFFI. We hypothesize that an estimated 1,867 incident
NFFI will predict future inpatient hospitalizations, increased risk of SNF stays and mortality. Our validated
approaches from past projects combine extensive cohort data across 20 years and linked Medicare claims to
examine increasing trends in fall injuries, including clinical NFFI, as a significant public health issue in old age."

In order to improve the health and wellbeing of our nationâs children, it is essential to transform pediatric health
care to address the complex social ecological factors that persistently hamper access to child health and
contribute to pervasive health inequities in the United States. Transforming the delivery of pediatric health care
requires robust programs of healthcare delivery research, using innovative stakeholder-engaged approaches to
ensure the development of acceptable, feasible, effective interventions ready for equitable implementation. The
overall goal of this Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) is to strengthen pediatric healthcare
delivery research infrastructure in Delaware, specifically at the Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children. Consistent
with this goal, we will establish a thematic, multidisciplinary health research system â The REACH (Research
Expanding Access to Child Health) Center â rooted in the principles and methods of pediatric healthcare delivery
science, bridging our biomedical research and health care systems, and focused on ensuring equitable access
to high quality pediatric health care for all. With strong scientific leadership and institutional commitment, the
REACH Center will create resources and provide mentoring to effectively accomplish three aims: 1) Expand
innovative programs of stakeholder-engaged intervention-focused research using advances in technology to
counter negative social ecological focuses and improve child health; 2) Enhance existing expertise and expand
research infrastructure through core resources supportive of health equity research for children; and, 3) Establish
a critical mass of independent multidisciplinary investigators to sustain a COBRE expanding access to child
health. Two outstanding junior investigators who are ideally poised for achieving independent NIH funding
propose initial research projects. Each focuses on refining and evaluating technology-enabled interventions to
improve equity in child health - the first for children with obesity in rural Delaware and the second for families
with a prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease. Three Administrative Core programs: Project Funding,
Mentorship, and Research Management will support the conduct of these and future REACH Center-funded
projects across the five years of the COBRE1 to increase and sustain pediatric health care research in Delaware.
Two Research Cores will ensure the rigorous design and conduct of these REACH Center-funded projects. The
PROMISE (Pediatric Research Optimizing Methods in Stakeholder Engagement) Core assures the infrastructure
necessary to engage important community and stakeholder partners in research. The IMPACT (Intervention
Methods: Provision and Connection through Technology) Core assures the necessary technological and
scientific resources to develop, test and evaluate outcomes of technology-enabled interventions. In partnership
with other IDeA state programs, REACH Center resources will extend existing assets and expand the Delaware
research community with important and unique emphases in child and family health and pediatric health equity."
10915594,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Laryngeal dystonia (LD) and voice tremor (VT) are hyperkinetic neurological disorders that significantly
impair voice and speech production and negatively impact the patientâs quality of life, extending beyond
speech motor alterations and often causing occupational disability and life-long social isolation. The standards
of clinical care of LD and VT are not established; that is, the differential diagnostic criteria remain vague,
leading to a high rate of misdiagnosis, whereas treatment is largely limited to temporary symptom management
with botulinum toxin injections into the affected laryngeal muscles. One of the major causes of suboptimal
clinical care of these patients is the limited understanding of their distinct clinical characteristics and neural
pathophysiology. We propose a multi-institutional, cross-disciplinary Center research program that will focus on
the delineation of unique clinical and pathophysiological features of LD and VT in order to establish the
fundamental framework for the enhanced clinical management of these disorders, including their accurate
diagnosis and disorder-specific therapies. The Center research goals will be accomplished through
collaborative clinical research studies at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Massachusetts General
Hospital, University of California San Francisco, and University of Utah, which will include three Center
Projects, a Scientific Core that incorporates the Clinical Research and Data Science components, and an
Administrative Core that provides an overall organizational infrastructure to the Center activities. The overall
Specific Aims of this Center will be (1) Characterization of clinical phenotypes of LD and VT; (2) Understanding
disorder-specific neural pathophysiology in LD and VT; (3) Deep brain stimulation in LD and VT, and (4)
Machine-learning platforms for differential diagnosis of LD and VT. We expect that our cross-disciplinary and
collaborative Center, encompassing the expertise in otolaryngology, speech-language pathology, neurology,
neurosurgery, brain and larynx imaging, invasive neurophysiology, and clinical neuroscience and applying
complementary multimodal methodologies across these fields, will have a significant positive impact on
developing new knowledge about the links between symptomatology and pathophysiology of LD and VT, which
will help define the new standards of enhanced clinical care of these disorders."
10700515,"Neurostimulation, including invasive methods like deep brain stimulation (DBS), is an increasingly important approach to treating mental illness. It offers the possibility of directly targeting the circuit dysfunctions that produce mental disorders. The clinical use of brain stimulation, and DBS in particular, has been limited by a lack of mechanistic understanding. We do not know why/how stimulating a specific region or pathway leads to symptom improvement. This limits our ability to correctly âdoseâ stimulation, or to verify biological target engagement. Further, mechanisms are difficult to dissect in humans, because (A) we cannot easily capture stimulationâs effects on brain circuits and (B) human patients cannot tolerate the many repeated experiments needed to map stimulation parameter space. Detailed network/mechanism mapping is possible in animals, but common animal models of psychiatric illness are not strong mirrors of human disease. This project attempts to overcome those barriers by modeling psychiatric DBSâ mechanisms through the lens of cognitive function â behaviors that can be more rigorously measured in both humans and animals. Specifically, we recently showed that DBS of the ventral internal capsule/ventral striatum (VCVS), acts in part by improving patientsâ executive function. In two human studies, we showed that VCVS DBS augments cognitive control â the ability to withhold a habitual/default response in favor of a more goal-aligned option. Further, this augmentation translates across species. We applied DBS-like stimulation to a rat homologue of VCVS, during a cognitive control task similar to our human paradigm. We saw improvements that very closely tracked our human results. We now propose to use that reverse-translational model to identify which cellular/circuit elements and neural activity variables mediate this behavioral improvement. A dominant theory argues that DBS in psychiatry works through white matter, e.g. by retrograde modulation of PFC through cortico-thalamic axons in VCVS. Our data suggest, however, that changes in local striatal activity are also important. We will replace electrical DBS with population-restricted optogenetic stimulation, mapping the contributions of individual cortico-thalamic circuits (Aim 1) and striatal sub-regions (Aim 2). During those manipulations, we will record spikes and LFP, at multiple sites within the cortico-striatal cognitive control circuitry. We will identify which variables are most strongly changed by DBS-like stimulation and correlate with behavior change (Aim 3). Success would identify putative mechanisms of a promising neurostimulation therapy, with near-term clinical implications. Technologies already exist to steer the DBS electric field to target specific axons/nuclei, and to titrate stimulation based on physiologic measures. The PI is a DBS psychiatrist, and could use those approaches in his own clinical program to target the mechanisms we identify."

This project builds upon 15 years of the CHARGE Study, which identified numerous environmental chemicals,
nutritional factors, and maternal health conditions that are associated with altered risk for autism spectrum
disorder (ASD). This work provided clues about potential pathogenic mechanisms and also produced the first
evidence of gene-by-environment (GxE) interaction. In this renewal, CHARGE study will continue to enroll in
order to achieve a solid sample size for statistically powerful analyses of both chemical mixtures and GxE
interactions. Risk factors of concern are preeclampsia, air pollution, and pesticides, each having replicated
evidence of association with ASD. This application departs from the focus on single exposures in isolate, and
instead emphasizes multifactorial causation: the focus is on mixtures and interactions. In aim 1, state-of-the-art
methods will be applied to understand the impact of exposure mixtures on risk for ASD and if feasible, to
identify which component(s) of the mixture most contributes to the overall effects. Aims 2 and 3 address
interactions between genes and non-genetic factors (GxE). Aim 2 is to identify common gene variants carried
by the mother, which, in combination with early life environmental or medical factors, amplify the risk for ASD,
more so than when either factor is assessed separately. The Precision Medicine Array from the Affymetrix
platform will be used to generate over 800,000 SNPs that draw heavily from metabolic, pharmacologic, and
immune-related regions of the genome. This project then pre-selects subsets of genes biologically relevant to
the activity or mechanism of toxicity of each exposure, using annotated gene ontology databases. The
resulting GxE analyses are expected to identify common variants that act synergistically with environmental
insults, which may have been unremarkable in gene-only studies, or gene studies that emphasized rare
variants. Aim 3 examines GxE interactions as in Aim 2, for the child's gene variants. To our knowledge, this will
be the first study to evaluate GxE interaction utilizing omics-scale genetics data in a sufficiently powered
analysis for detecting interactions. The proposed work moves autism etiologic research into a new direction
that bridges separate silos of genetic and environmental research, creating a dynamic interdisciplinary and
integrative science. Given shared biologic pathways between some genes and certain environmental
exposures, the proposed project has potential to advance etiologic research towards targeted interventions
that could reduce risk for ASD or ASD-associated disabilities and improve lives of affected individuals and their
families. Additional significance may derive from identification of common variants that have hitherto eluded the
traditional genetics enterprise. The long-term impacts may therefore be the emergence of a shift in etiologic
research that unifies fragmented disciplinary approaches; major advancement in understanding common
variants; and the possibility for public health precision interventions that expand notions of genetic
susceptibility to encompass the biochemical milieu of the intrauterine and broader postnatal environment."
10541823,"SUMMARY
Smoking is addictive and most smokers would like to quit. However, even with treatment, only a small
percentage of smokers quits successfully. Clinical studies indicate that smoking cessation leads to anhedonia,
which increases the risk for relapse. Nicotine induces the release of dopamine (DA), which plays a role in
establishing habitual smoking, while the activation of stress systems has been suggested to mediate
withdrawal and anhedonia. Virtually all animal studies have been conducted with nondependent rodents that
had limited or short access to nicotine. Therefore, very little is known about the mechanisms that mediate
withdrawal and self-administration in dependent animals with high levels of nicotine intake. To develop new
smoking cessation treatments, more insight is needed into the neurobiological mechanisms that mediate
withdrawal and nicotine intake in animals that have become dependent by self-administering nicotine. The
long-term goal of this research program is to determine the adaptations in the reward system that cause high
levels of nicotine intake and anhedonia in dependent animals. The objective of our studies is to determine the
role of DA and the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) in nicotine self-administration in dependent animals
and withdrawal-induced anhedonia. It is proposed to use an intermittent long access model to obtain high
levels of nicotine intake and induce dependence. Our preliminary studies point to a role for DA in high levels of
nicotine intake in dependent animals, and brain stress systems in the anhedonia associated with withdrawal.
Based on our studies, it is hypothesized that DA transmission and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling in the
nucleus accumbens (Nacc) are pivotal for high levels of nicotine intake and anhedonia associated with nicotine
withdrawal. Three aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. 1) Determine the relationship between nicotine
intake and reward function in dependent (long access) and nondependent (short access) animals. 2)
Determine the role of DA signaling in nicotine intake in dependent and nondependent animals. 3) Determine
the role of DA-CORT interactions in the Nacc in nicotine intake and anhedonia in dependent and
nondependent animals. To investigate the relationship between nicotine intake and reward function, male and
female rats will be prepared with intravenous catheters and intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) electrodes. The
ICSS method provides an objective measure of reward function. Dopamine antagonists and transgenic D1-Cre
and D2-Cre rats will be used to determine the role of D1 and D2 neurons in the Nacc in high levels of nicotine
intake and withdrawal. It is predicted that D1 receptors play a critical role in nicotine intake in dependent and
nondependent animals. It is also expected that blockade of GR will decrease nicotine intake in dependent
animals, prevents the decrease in DA levels in the Nacc during withdrawal, and diminishes anhedonia
associated with nicotine withdrawal. The studies will provide insight into the role of DA and CORT in the Nacc
in high levels of nicotine self-administration in dependent animals and withdrawal-induced anhedonia."
10786090,"Project Summary
Childhood tuberculosis (TB) has greater risk of morbidity and mortality than adult disease, yet
diagnostic and prognostic tests discovered in adults are less accurate in children. There is a critical
need for more sensitive diagnostic tests for childhood TB that do not need respiratory sample
collection; for prognostic tests that are more specific in Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG)-vaccinated
children; and for improved tools to monitor treatment. Two novel approaches, host blood RNA
signatures and the T cell Antigen-Specific Activation assay, target complementary aspects of the
immune response and offer promise as diagnostic, prognostic and treatment-response biomarkers of
childhood TB. A prognostic RNA signature of TB risk that also shows excellent diagnostic sensitivity
and specificity for active TB, and response to treatment that mirrors disease progression, has been
discovered in adults. Validation by qRT-PCR has been achieved; parsimonious 11-gene and 6-gene
versions have been developed with identical performance; and the signature shows promising
diagnostic sensitivity and specificity when applied to published pediatric microarray data. A host blood
biomarker that measures activation of M.tb-specific T cells also yields excellent diagnostic
performance. We validated and translated this T cell biomarker to a simplified whole blood assay
suitable for pediatric use on basic flow cytometers widely available to HIV screening programs. We will
evaluate performance of these two biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of pediatric TB disease and
explore response to treatment. We will enroll a cohort of children with household exposure to an adult
TB patient; evaluate them for TB disease by standardized investigation algorithm using a rigorous case
definition; and collect blood for biomarker assays at baseline. Children without prevalent TB disease will
be referred for preventive therapy and thereafter followed for incident TB disease for up to 3 years.
Children diagnosed with TB disease will have blood sampled during curative treatment. We will
evaluate diagnostic performance of these host blood biomarkers compared with Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra
and prognostic performance compared with interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA); discover whether
innate immune genetic variants are associated with biomarker expression; and project public health
impact and cost-effectiveness of biomarker-targeted screening strategies for pediatric TB. A host blood
biomarker that displays a characteristic response through the spectrum of pathogenesis of pediatric TB,
increasing from M.tuberculosis infection through progression to disease and resolving during treatment,
would be a major advance towards better diagnostic, prognostic and treatment monitoring tools for
childhood TB."
10877756,"Summary
Tribal lands are impacted by more than 15,000 hazardous waste sites and 7,000 abandoned mines that can
disrupt the redox chemistry of aquifers and release toxic metals. In collaboration with tribal communities from
North/South Dakota, we found that arsenic (As) and uranium (U) affect drinking water in private wells and rural
water systems in the Northern Plains. Our data also show that in the 1990s/early 2000s Native Americans from
the Northern Plains experienced urinary As and U levels 2.5 to 5 times higher than other US populations, likely
contributing to a high burden of cardiovascular disease. Knowledge is needed on current metal exposure levels,
sources (local and distal), health effects (concurrent, latent, joint), mechanistic pathways, and effective
remediation systems. To address these scientific and technology gaps, we have established the Columbia
University Northern Plains Superfund Research Program. This new partnership has five Projects and four Cores
and will use systems science, local knowledge, and innovative technology through the following aims: (1)
Develop household-level spatial and temporal models of groundwater metal concentrations integrating new
measures of water As, U, and redox parameters with USGS and IHS data. These models can identify safe water
vs. where mitigation interventions are needed. (2) Trace sources and cycling of metals in water and biological
specimens through stable isotope measurements (U, Se) to reveal redox state and inform on local and distal
sources of contamination, directly addressing our communitiesâ concern. (3) Determine latent and concurrent
cardiometabolic effects of As and U in humans (Strong Heart As/U Lifelong study, SHAUL), and in human-
relevant mouse models. These data will enhance the assessment of causality and the role of early life exposures.
(4) Integrate molecular mechanisms of As and U toxicity using multi-omics (epigenomics, metabolomics) in
longitudinal studies in humans (SHAUL) and mice. The cross-species comparison can identify robust signatures
and mechanisms to help generate intervention strategies. (5) Develop sustainable interventions using light-
based, point-of-use water remediation technology for As/U. This system will produce and recycle adsorption
media with photosynthetic bacteria and alert residents before treatment failure. The Community Engagement
Core will be centrally located in the Northern Plains, contributing to all research activities and local dissemination.
The Data Management and Analysis and Administrative Cores will optimize use of the complex data generated
while respecting tribal data sovereignty and promoting evidence-based policies and practices to address
hazardous toxic metals and contribute to disease prevention. We will train the next generation of scientists in
systems science, technology, Indigenous research ethics, and community outreach. The breadth, depth, and
innovation of our approaches, the communityâs central role, the institutional support, and our experience working
together will lay the groundwork for interventions that address key concerns for water quality and human health
in communities in the Northern Plains and near abandoned mines and Superfund sites."
10738718,"Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are common and can be life-threatening if they progress to rupture. They
have been reported in up to 8% of older men and account for over 15,000 deaths per year. Basic vessel
dimensions are currently the primary imaging measurement used clinically to risk-stratify patients. But there is
more to the story than dimensions. Wall stress estimated with computational biomechanical modeling may
better predict growth and rupture than diameters. Furthermore, AAA growth is often not continuous, and
instead marked by periods of rapid growth followed by quiescence. Small series report that unrelated surgical
procedures can precipitate AAA rupture, suggesting that episodic and heterogeneous inflammatory processes
in concert with adverse hemodynamics and biomechanics are important for the progression of AAA disease.
The complexity of aortic disease is more fully revealed with new functional imaging techniques than with
conventional anatomic analysis alone. While AAA has been extensively studied, the mechanisms of disease
progression have not been fully elucidated. If better understood, they could lead to significant improvement of
the management of veterans with small AAAs (< 5.5 cm). Many of these aneurysms can be followed safely
with a long screening interval of 2-3 years, but some may progress to rupture. Identifying this subset would
greatly streamline the surveillance imaging of veterans with AAA. On the other hand, the majority of AAAs
never rupture, and identifying low risk veterans could help better manage resources and subject only those
veterans at truly elevated risk to intervention.
MRI uniquely offers comprehensive assessment of forces acting on the vessel wall (hemodynamics and
biomechanics), as well as factors affecting wall strength (structure, morphology and inflammation). Blood flow
imaging with time-resolved 3D phase-contrast MRI (4D Flow) allows quantification of key parameters including
flow turbulence and wall shear stress. Dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI may offer efficient evaluation of
aortic wall inflammation. Cine Displacement Encoding with Stimulated Echoes (DENSE) MRI can quantify
regional stretch differences experienced by the vessel wall, and, in tandem with 3D volumetric MRI anatomic
data and computational modeling can be used to calculate patient-specific mechanical wall stress.
The aim of our study is to uncover important inflammatory changes and adverse hemodynamics and
biomechanics that are not addressed by current imaging, and use them to predict AAA disease progression.
We also seek to optimize a short (5 minute) MRI protocol without contrast to determine if there is added value
to this comprehensive assessment, as fast non-contrast MRI would be preferable and more efficiently use VA
resources. Our overall goal is to meaningfully advance the assessment of risk in veterans who do not meet
current intervention thresholds and thereby in the future improve outcomes by refining surveillance imaging
regimens and decisions regarding early intervention for AAAs."
10731351,"The continuing increase in prevalence of obesity in older adults has become a major health concern. In older
adults, obesity not only causes serious medical problems, but it also exacerbates the age-related decline in
physical function, which causes frailty, impairs quality of life, and increases nursing home admissions. Thus,
failure to help obese older patients in managing weight increases future demand for chronic health care services.
We reported not only that frailty is common in obese older adults due to sarcopenic obesity but also that lifestyle
therapy resulting in weight loss in this understudied population improves physical function and ameliorates frailty.
However, the improvement in physical function was modest and most obese older adults remained frail.
Moreover, the weight loss-induced reduction of muscle and bone mass could worsen age-related sarcopenia
and osteopenia. Accordingly, many health care providers remain reluctant to recommend lifestyle therapy that
includes weight loss in the frail, obese elderly because of the uncertainty of whether the benefits outweigh the
risks, although weight loss and exercise is recommended as part of standard care for obese patients in general.
 Metformin, a biguanide, is a widely available oral drug used as treatment of diabetes. Animal studies have
shown that metformin improves both lifespan and health span. However, whether metformin can ameliorate
frailty in humans is not known. If metformin improves or preserves physical function, this mostly safe and
commonly-used drug would revolutionize the approach to frailty in the elderly. Indeed, encouraging preliminary
data from our prior randomized controlled trials (RCT) in this population demonstrated that metformin users,
despite being still considered frail, have higher baseline scores in the Physical Performance Test (PPT)
compared to non-users. More importantly, the use of metformin during the trials predicted much larger
improvements in PPT scores in response to lifestyle interventions. Hence these data, in conjunction with results
from our prior studies, suggest that each of lifestyle therapy and metformin is associated with amelioration of
frailty, but the additive effects of both in combination could result in reversal of the frailty. In this project, we
propose the concept that the addition of metformin to lifestyle therapy reverses frailty by reducing cellular
senescence and senescence-associated phenotype (SASP), especially in obese older adults with a high burden
of senescent cells and accelerated aging. Accordingly, our objective is to conduct the first head-head,
comparative efficacy, placebo-controlled RCT to test the novel hypothesis that lifestyle therapy + metformin for
six months will be more effective than lifestyle therapy alone or metformin alone in improving physical function
and preventing the weight loss-induced reduction in muscle and bone mass in obese (BMI â¥ 30 kg/m2) older
(age â¥ 65 years) veterans with physical frailty. Specifically we hypothesize that compared to lifestyle therapy
alone or metformin alone, lifestyle therapy + metformin will cause: 1) a greater improvement in physical function,
2) a greater preservation in lean body mass and muscle quality, and in bone mineral density and bone quality,
and 3) a greater reduction in markers of cell cycle arrest and SASP in skeletal muscle tissues along with greater
increase in telomere length. Our overarching hypothesis across aims is that a multicomponent intervention
consisting of lifestyle therapy + metformin will be the most effective strategy for reversing sarcopenic obesity and
frailty in obese older veterans, as mediated by their additive effects in suppressing cellular senescence and thus,
stimulating muscle and bone anabolism in this understudied, high-risk population.
 The epidemic of obesity in US veterans has surpassed that of the general population and even more
so, among older veterans using the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). In older veterans with obesity,
frailty predisposes to loss of functional independence and adverse health outcomes. The novel health outcomes
and mechanistic-based data generated from this proposed RCT will have important consequences for the
standard of care for this rapidly increasing segment of the aging veteran population."
10890256,"Summary
Compelling data support a contemporary version of the amyloid cascade hypothesis (ACH) as a valid framework both for
understanding AD pathogenesis and the development of disease modifying therapeutics. However, key aspects of the ACH
are not well understood. One such aspect is the relationship between accumulation of aggregated AÎ² and neurodegeneration.
The mainstream concepts regarding this relationship are that aggregates of AÎ² are directly neurotoxic and/or trigger a toxic
glial response. However, numerous observations indicate that the link between AÎ² accumulation and neurodegeneration
may be more complex. As a working hypothesis and a non-exclusive mechanism to the direct AÎ² aggregate âtoxinâ model,
we propose that a large number of biologically active proteins that we will refer to as amyloid associated proteins (AAPs)
accumulate in the brain as AÎ² deposits. Thus, AÎ² aggregate accumulation may not be sufficiently toxic to induce
downstream neurodegeneration unless accompanied by AAP accumulation. Indeed, in this scenario accumulation of AAPs
helps to trigger the neurodegenerative phase of AD, accounting for the long delay between onset of AÎ² deposition and
neurodegeneration in humans. The proposed studies will leverage extensive data from the AMP-AD initiative and other
published studies that has used state of the art proteomics to identify a large number of candidate AAPs that are increased
both in AD and mouse models of AÎ² deposition. Many of these candidate AAPs have known or inferred cell-signaling
functions. Further, for some candidate AAPs there is either previous data demonstrating that they are associated with AD
or we have generated novel data showing accumulation in senile plaques. Finally, as shown by others for the AAPs, ApoE
and clusterin, we find that expression of select AAPs (midkine, pleiotrophin) modulates amyloid deposition. Building off
this preliminary data, we propose three aims that are designed to probe our global hypothesis. In Aim 1 we will evaluate the
spatiotemporal accumulation of AAPs in AD and in mouse models of amyloid deposition. In Aim 2 we will use rAAV-
mediated expression of the AAPs in APP mouse models to a) further evaluate the association with amyloid plaques, b)
determine if expression alters amyloid deposition and influences other AD relevant pathologies independent of effects on
AÎ². In Aim 3 we intend to explore the mechanisms by which the AAP associates with the plaque and how that association
might alter the biological properties of the AAP."
10559625,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Electrical stimulation (ES) of low-threshold AÎ²-nerve fibers is a clinical strategy for treating chronic pain
that is refractory to pharmacotherapies, including opiates. However, the mechanisms underlying pain
inhibition by AÎ²-fiber activation remain elusive, limiting further clinical and technological improvements. Our
major goal is to uncover spinal neuronal and non-neuronal mechanisms of pain inhibition by AÎ²-ES, and to
identify targets for rationally selecting adjuvant drugs to enhance pain inhibition and avoid side effects. In Aim
1, by using animal models of neuropathic pain, we will first delineate spinal neuronal mechanisms by which
AÎ²-ES inhibits pain transmission. Electrophysiology studies will uncover how different forms of AÎ²-ES
modulate functionally distinct subsets of superficial dorsal horn neurons (e.g., inhibitory vs. excitatory
neurons), and further differentiate the underlying receptor mechanisms. We postulate that the excitatory
neuron-preferred inhibition may enable AÎ²-ES to be used together with low-dose adjuvant drugs for
circuitry-specific enhancement of pain inhibition. We will test whether limiting endogenous adenosine
degradation or GABA reuptake during AÎ²-ES specifically enhances the inhibition of dorsal horn excitatory
and projection neurons and increases the net inhibition of pain transmission. In Aim 2, we will then unveil a
non-neuronal pain gating mechanism activated by AÎ²-ES. By conducting high-throughput GCaMP6 imaging
and electrophysiology recording, we will examine whether AÎ²-ES activates spinal astrocytes to induce
inhibition of spinal nociceptive transmission, and whether this process is attenuated by nerve injury. Since
pain inhibition by dorsal column stimulation (DCS) is intrinsically linked with activation of AÎ²-fibers, DCS will
be used as a proof-of-principle for studying AÎ²-ES in vivo. We will examine whether DCS changes astrocyte
reactive markers, affects the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators, and promotes microglial polarization from
M1 to M2 state after nerve injury. We will further test whether glia-derived adenosine inhibits excitatory or
projection neurons and enhances AÎ²-ESâinduced inhibition of these neurons. Our findings in Aims 1 and 2
will help us to develop new strategies of enhancing pain inhibition by AÎ²-ES in Aim 3. We will test whether
inhibition of neuropathic pain-related behavior by DCS can be enhanced by limiting degradation of
endogenous adenosine and inhibiting GABA reuptake in the spinal cord. Owing to use-dependent and
circuitry-specific features, we expect that the treatment will not induce side effects. Our findings will reveal
new mechanisms underlying pain inhibition by AÎ²-ES, and will provide important rationales and drug targets
for future translational studies aimed at using low-dose adjuvant drugs to improve the efficacy and specificity
of pain inhibition by AÎ²-ES therapies."
10551805,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this study is to adapt and test the effectiveness of a multilevel intervention to reduce chronic
disease risks in socioeconomically disadvantaged, unemployed populations that can be readily adopted by
communities. Studies have shown that an unemployment episode exacerbates engaging in health-
compromising behaviors, psychological distress, accelerated weight gain, and higher blood pressure â all of
which increase chronic disease risk. Although socioeconomically disadvantaged adults often receive public
assistance benefits, job training, and job placement services through Department of Social Services
Employment (DSS-E) programs if job loss occurs; these programs do not include prevention-focused content
to reduce the chronic disease risks that accrue with unemployment episodes. In addition, DSS-E efforts to help
individuals succeed in securing and performing in a new job are often thwarted by implicit âwelfareâ-related bias
and insufficient job supports in the work environments that DSS-E clients are hired into. We will use a
randomized, 2 x 2 factorial design to test interventions at each of two levels (individual, and employer), and
their joint effects, in DSS-E clients and employers that hire this population. In Year 1, we will make minor
adaptations to existing interventions at each level to ensure they are contextually relevant to the
unemployment, and job-entry experiences of DSS-E populations. At the individual level, 600 DSS-E clients will
be randomly assigned to a group that receives usual DSS-E in addition to a Chronic Disease Prevention
Program (CDPP) that includes online instruction and individual lifestyle coaching sessions, or a group that
receives usual DSS-E services only. At the employer level, between 50-80 employers will be allocated to an
intervention or control arm using an adaptive, biased-coin randomization approach to ensure balance across
the four treatment conditions. The employer intervention combines implicit bias awareness training for
supervisors of hired DSS-E clients, and regular, structured, interactions between supervisors and DSS-E hires.
The interventions at each level are designed to mitigate the psychological, behavioral, and clinically relevant
risks for chronic disease onset, morbidity, and comorbidity that accrue with unemployment and structural
factors in the workplace that can exacerbate these risks. This proposed research builds on the strengths of
long-standing academic-community partnerships between the research team and key stakeholders across
health, social service, employment, and economic development sectors. The findings from this study will
advance the science of chronic disease prevention for this vulnerable target population, and will inform national

10580603,"Abstract
Chronic diseases are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and have the capacity to
bankrupt the American healthcare system as drivers of the nation's $3.3 trillion in annual health care costs.
Disparities in the burden of chronic disease are also evident among certain populations (e.g., racial/ethnic
minority groups, individuals of lower socioeconomic status). Behavioral and social science research (BSSR)
targeting lifestyle risk factors within context can successfully reduce chronic disease morbidity and mortality.
The science of dissemination and implementation (D&I) aims to shorten the translation gap from discovery to
impact of evidence-based interventions in real world community and clinical settings to benefit population
health.
 Training the next generation of researchers in the field D&I will improve the adoption of BSSR and
interventions that can effectively prevent and manage chronic disease. To address this priority, this R25
application proposes an innovative educational program entitled Mentored Education for Dissemination
and Implementation Science (MEDIS), which will address a cross cutting need by providing researchers with
advanced training in D&I competencies through a 5-day Summer short course offered annually, and combined
with ongoing mentorship to enhance learning. MEDIS is significant because it will promote the D&I of BSSR in
real world settings where evidence-based interventions exist but are not yet commonly applied, and where a
large reduction in chronic disease morbidity and mortality is feasible if this knowledge was widely taken up into
practice.
 The specific aims of this application are to:
1. Implement MEDIS to train researchers (Fellows) to facilitate the D&I of BSSR in the context of community
 and clinical settings to eliminate chronic disease disparities. To accomplish aim 1, we will: a) Implement a
 recruitment plan to identify a high-quality pool of diverse Fellows; b) Train Faculty mentors and match them
 with Fellows to foster ongoing mentoring in D&I research; and c) Conduct a Summer Course for Fellows to
 build competency in D&I research.
2. Evaluate MEDIS and track Fellows' career development. To accomplish aim 2, we will: a) Evaluate the
 Fellows in achieving D&I-related competencies, mentoring, and career progress; and b) Evaluate the
 Faculty for relevance and quality of presentations and mentoring ability.
3. Actively disseminate MEDIS components and support Fellows in capacity building activities at their
 institutions and with community partners. To accomplish aim 3, we will: a) Identify key audiences for
 dissemination; b) Conduct active dissemination; and c) Develop a train-the-trainer module for Fellows."
10794197,"Project Summary/Abstract
Suicide is the second leading cause of death (behind accidents) among those ages 10-34 years in the US and
is the cause of mortality most strongly linked to mental illness. Starting at approximately age 12 years, the rate
of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) increases dramatically, especially among girls, who experience STBs
at twice the rate for boys. These pronounced increases for adolescents and for girls have been well-documented
for decades and are seen in virtually every country/culture around the world, yet, there is no firm understanding
of why they exist. Moreover, very little is known about when risk is highest. The proposed research extends our
teamâs prior work, funded by two prior R01 awards, examining adolescent girlsâ stress responses as prospective
predictors of STB trajectories, and a K99/R00 award revealing that changes in reproductive hormones across
the menstrual cycle produce specific periods of high STB risk (particularly during the peri-menstrual phase)
among adult women. Specifically, we hypothesize that girls will report higher occurrence and severity of STBs
on days in the peri-menstrual phase than on days in other cycle phases (mid-follicular, ovulatory, mid-luteal),
that these increases will be mediated by daily changes in negative affect and stress-reactivity during the peri-
menstrual phase, and that girls with greater cyclical hormone sensitivity are at greater long-term risk of STBs,
particularly during times when interpersonal stress is elevated. We propose to test these hypotheses in a sample
of 200 clinically-referred girls ages 12-17 years who are at least one year post-menarche. The design begins
with 70 days (two cycles) of daily surveys to assess negative affect and STBs. In addition, girls will complete two
counterbalanced laboratory visits (at high risk peri-menstrual and low risk mid-follicular phases) during which we
will evaluate their affective and physiological (autonomic, cortisol, genomic) responses to a standardized
laboratory stressor. Next, girls will complete weekly surveys measuring cycle phase, interpersonal stress,
negative affect, and STBs through one year of follow up. The intensive two-month baseline phase allows us to
examine how the menstrual cycle shapes daily affective and physiological risk for STBs and lets us diagnose
each girlâs degree of hormone sensitivity. These baseline individual differences in hormone sensitivity then can
be examined as a predictor of STBs across the follow-up year of assessments, particularly during periods of
elevated social stress. This powerful design will clarify whether cyclical changes in daily STBs (Aim 1) are
mediated by affective and physiological STB risk factors, such as negative affect (Aim 2a; measured via daily
surveys) and social stress reactivity (Aim 2b; measured via lab-based behavioral, physiological, and molecular
biomarker assays), while also acknowledging critical moderation by both individual differences in hormone
sensitivity (i.e., not all girls will have severe cyclical mood changes) and time-varying interpersonal stress (Aim
3). This innovative study will address several long-standing questions in the literature, including why girls are at
increased risk, when girls may be most at risk, and which girls are at highest risk for future STBs."

 For more than 15 years, the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center (HCC) Head and Neck SPORE has facilitated
practice change in diagnosis and treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) and other
head and neck cancers. For the renewal period, the SPORE will focus on the remaining problems of
debilitating toxicities, low immunotherapy response rates, and the need for precision oncology in HNSCC
treatment. Through its multidisciplinary project teams, four clinical trials, and analysis of a completed clinical
trial, the SPORE will investigate: 1) how hypoxia and metabolic dysregulation leads to PD-1 immunotherapy
resistance and how it can be overcome, 2) how patients with human papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal
cancers can be optimally selected for deintensified therapy, and 3) which biomarkers can be used for
predicting responsiveness to combined immunotherapy with PD-1 and LAG3 inhibitors. The studies will be
conducted with the support of state-of-the-art Cores that provide access to over 6,400 well-characterized,
clinically annotated biospecimens; biostatistical and bioinformatics support; and advanced technology
platforms that include multiplexed cytometry and imaging, next generation and single sequencing; and
radiomic and radiogenomic analyses based on features extracted from patient CT scans. Through the
SPOREâs Developmental Research Program (DRP) and Career Enhancement Program (CEP),
translational head and neck cancer research will be further advanced with new ideas, research strategies, and
investigators. These programs will focus heavily on increasing diversity by attracting and advancing projects
from woman and underrepresented minorities groups via internal initiatives and external collaborations. Critical
to the success of the research is the wealth of longitudinal clinical data collected on nearly 12,000 patients with
longitudinal 30 yearsâ of clinical follow up in the SPOREâs Organ Specific Database (OSD), which is now been
expanded to include quality of life measures, as well as extensive genomics, radiomics and transcriptomic
data. Established horizontal and vertical collaborations with other Cancer Centers, national cooperative trial
groups, industrial partners enable and extend the efforts of the SPORE investigators. Submission of this
renewal application was intentionally taken off cycle, separating its renewal cycle from the HCC CCSG P30, to
maximize institutional resources that could be devoted to both applications, as well as to provide additional
time for newly recruited SPORE leaders to collaborate and solidify their interactions as a team at HCC. HCCâs
has continued to support the HN SPORE, including soliciting CEP and DRP awards, highlight its strong
commitment to its renewal."
10554288,"Disfunction of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), plays a crucial role in compulsive cocaine use and addiction.
The role of glia in addition to that of neurons and vascular networks in cocaine-induced PFC dysfunction
remains elusive. In the completing R01, we showed that the neurotoxic effects of cocaine were associated
with persistent decreases in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and an elevation in intracellular calcium in cortex;
however, we did not assess the role of glia versus that of neurons on the CBF decreases. This renewal
application, ""Calcium-related neurotoxicity of cocaine"", will assess the effects of acute and chronic cocaine
on astrocytic Ca2+ and its role on the CBF deficits and neuronal Ca2+ increases in PFC and their association
with cocaine intake in an animal model of compulsive-like cocaine self-administration.
 Specifically, we will apply multimodality optical imaging (MOI) in combination with genetically-encoded
Ca2+ indicators to capture activities in neurons (jRGECO1a) and astrocytes (GCaMP6f) and ultrahigh-
resolution optical coherence angiography and Doppler tomography (ÂµODT) for quantitative imaging of 3D
CBF networks in PFC of GFAP cre mice (Aim 1). We will apply chemogenetics with Designer Receptors
Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) to manipulate astrocytic Ca2+ accumulation while
assessing its consequences on acute and chronic cocaineâs vascular and neuronal effects and cocaine
intake (Aim 2, Aim 3).
 These studies will be valuable for understanding how astrocyte and neuronal networks in the PFC
interact and mediate the associated local neurovascular responses to cocaine and how they contribute to
compulsive-like drug consumption, providing knowledge to guide development of novel addiction
interventions."
10586021,"Project Summary
Significance: There is an urgent need for novel approaches to treat or prevent Entamoeba histolytica as it is an
important cause of diarrhea in infants in low income countries. There is no vaccine and only a single class of
antiparasitics is effective for invasive amebiasis.
Hypothesis: This project will test the hypothesis that metabolic products of the gut microbiome are capable of
epigenetically altering the bone marrow to increase intestinal neutrophilic inflammation and provide antigen-
nonspecific protection during subsequent ameba infection.
Approach: This project will determine how the gut microbiome communicates with the bone marrow to regulate
intestinal inflammation to subsequent infection. Preliminary data suggest that epigenetic changes in the bone
marrow, caused by exposure to the intestinal bacteria Clostridium scindens, are sufficient to confer mucosal
protection from subsequent Entamoeba histolytica infection. This finding led to the hypothesis that gut
colonization with C. scindens increases a serum mediator (deoxycholate) that then acts on the marrow
(JMJD3) to help support granulocyte monocyte progenitor (GMP) expansion and a more robust gut neutrophil
response. Aim 1 will determine how C. scindens communicates from the gut to the marrow. Aim 2 and 3 will
determine how the bone marrow is epigenetically altered during C. scindens colonization and protects from
Entamoeba. Successful completion of these studies will identify how intestinal Clostridia communicate with the
marrow to induce epigenetic changes that induce antigen-nonspecific âtrained innate immunityâ. Additionally,
the impact of our approach extends beyond amebiasis and infectious diseases to basic mechanisms of
hematopoiesis and innate trained immunity. Successful completion of these studies will aid in development of
next generation treatments that leverage the microbiome and trained immunity to help in clearance of
pathogens or help modulate the severity of inflammation.
Innovation: This work will provide a greater understanding of fundamental processes underlying trained
immunity induced by the host microbiota. Novel concepts derived from this work will identify pathways
important in microbiota-mediated protection from infection that can be targeted by translational medicine.
The environment for this work is a research group and Division dedicated to the study of the pathogenesis of
infectious colitis, including amebiasis, for the past 25 years. Extensive expertise in Epigenetics, Bioinformatics,
and Clostridia biology is also included (see letters of support). Dr. Burgess, the project PI, is well cited in the
field of trained immunity and pioneered study of the microbiome in regulating susceptibility to amebic colitis."

Under leadership of its fourth Center Director, John L. Cleveland, PhD, the singular mission of Moffitt Cancer
Center (âMoffittâ), established in state statute only 30 years ago, is âto contribute to the prevention and cure of
cancer.â Fully informed by cancer needs in our community and catchment area; guided by highly effective, driven
and synergistic senior leadership and a rigorous research strategic plan; supported by tremendous institutional
funding; and cultivated by its five research Programs that span the basic, population, data, and clinical sciences;
Moffitt fosters exceptional cancer research that spans discovery to translation to the clinic and to the community.
Moffitt serves a 15-county catchment area of West Central Florida comprised of diverse sociodemographic
groups and vulnerable populations, including Blacks, Hispanics (particularly of Puerto Rican descent), rural
residents, persons living with HIV, and the elderly. Key catchment area cancers at higher incidence than the
state and nation include lung, melanoma, ovarian and HPV-related cancers (oropharynx, cervix). Community-
driven priorities are cancer prevention and screening, access to care, clinical trials, and vulnerable populations.
Moffittâs 183 Members are organized into five highly collaborative research Programs â Cancer Biology &
Evolution; Cancer Epidemiology; Health Outcomes & Behavior; Immuno-Oncology; and Molecular Medicine â
whose research is supported by four Centers of Excellence focused on catchment area needs. Members have
produced exceptional science, supported by 14 Shared Resources (2 developmental), more than $2M in annual
institutional pilot funds, and exceptional central administration. Peer-reviewed grants have increased 32% and
funding has risen to $36.0M, including $18.1M from NCI (excluding CCSG and $2.4M training grants). Members
now hold 68 MPI awards (53 peer-reviewed). 3,279 articles were published, including 543 in journals with an
impact factor > 10. Publication rates are 24.2%, 18.7%, and 91.2% for intra-programmatic, inter-programmatic,
and inter-Center collaborations, respectively. 123 INDs and 184 patents were filed, and 15,309 patients (16,321
including affiliates) were accrued to interventional trials; 5,471 to treatment trials (5,716 including affiliates).
Guided by a new Research & Education Training Office, Moffitt educated more than 5,700 students, trainees,
and faculty over the award period, impacting all five Programs and clinical activities. Moffitt has 15 peer-review
training grants (T32, R25, F and K) and two NCI-funded minority-focused inter-institutional partnerships.
Importantly, Moffittâs research has provided paradigm shifts in our understanding of the cancer ecosystem, has
discovered and advanced new means to prevent, treat and even cure some forms of cancer, and has led to
changes in clinical practice and national health policy. Over the next cycle Moffitt research and clinical impact
will be accelerated by investments focused on: 1) our catchment area; 2) health disparities; 3) immuno-oncology;
4) metabolism; 5) data science; and 6) cancer care, delivery, and implementation science. These efforts will
support Moffittâs remarkable growth trajectory for decades to come and its mission to reduce the cancer burden."

This proposal seeks to develop a âDiabetes Institute Summer Interprofessional Research
Experience (DISIRE)â program to train undergraduate students. The vision for the DISIRE
education program is to increase the number of underrepresented minority and Appalachian
undergraduates who enter graduate programs in the biological sciences, health sciences or
related fields. The Diabetes Institute at Ohio University will recruit a diverse group of 10
participants each year with a focus on minority students, first-generation Appalachian students,
and persons with disabilities with little to no exposure to biological and health sciences graduate
programs. DISIRE participants will train with experienced diabetes researchers in the 10-week
summer program. Recruitment will target upperclassmen from minority serving institutions,
small liberal arts colleges, and Appalachian universities without graduate programs or extensive
education in diabetes. The DISIRE curriculum will be interdisciplinary-focused consisting of
online instruction, weekly seminars, journal club didactics, a group capstone project, and
research with a mentor. The online course will be an abridged version of âDiabetes: From
Bench-to-Bedsideâ, an existing, comprehensive course that explores the genetics, physiology,
treatment, self-management, and psychosocial care of diabetes. An innovative component of
the DISIRE program is the group capstone project, a learning-pathway experience designed to
encourage participants to think critically, develop problem-solving skills, encourage goal setting,
and promote teamwork. The capstone project will address an important issue or problem about
diabetes on their college or university campuses. Thus, the capstone project will not only benefit
the participantsâ communities, but also serves to foster a life-long community engagement of
participants, as they will be able to directly observe the benefit of the implementation of scientific
knowledge. The apprentice-based research experience, which will develop research skills and
build self-efficacy in the participants, is a critical component of the DISIRE program. Each
participant will design a research project with their selected mentor and be involved in all
aspects of conducting research from hypothesis generation to dissemination of findings. The
final research projects will be presented at a research symposium in conjunction with the other
summer undergraduate programs and graduate programs at Ohio University. Project mentors
will maintain a long-term mentoring relationship with participants and provide guidance and
encouragement to the participants during the application process to graduate school."
10816575,"Recombinant AAV vectors have shown great promise in clinical trials. These vectors represent a gene
transfer/genome editing platform that has the potential to treat not only genetic diseases but a myriad of
acquired disorders that include infection and infection prophylaxis, neurodegeneration, and diseases resulting
from immune system dysfunction. One of the major rate-limiting steps in translating the success achieved in
animal models of human disease to humans is the lack of a strong correlation between vector transduction
properties between species. Because transduction is dictated in large part by variations in the capsid protein
sequence, in order to obtain capsids with enhanced transducing properties in humans we have pursued multi-
species capsid shuffling, and in vitro and in vivo evolutionary selection paradigms to create and identify novel
chimeric capsids with clinically relevant assets. During the current funding period, we discovered several
chimeric capsids with a 10-fold increased primate liver transduction profile. One of these capsids is in clinical
trials, and two more recent isolates are in late preclinical testing by commercial and academic centers. Yet
even these improved AAV vectors do not appear to reach the same level of transduction that can be achieved
in rodents with other established AAV capsids. Thus, the general goal of the proposed work is to build upon
our efforts to develop high throughput technologies for new capsid engineering approaches, and optimized
selection schemes. Our specific goals are to create and identify capsids that have enhanced: (1) human liver
transduction, (2) penetration through the human blood brain barrier and transduction of neurons and
astrocytes, and (3)transduction of human hematopoietic stem cells for increased genome editing efficiencies.
We will also study the mechanism behind the species selectivity observed with several of our new specific
chimeric capsid derived vectors. The vectors that are obtained in the respective screens will be further
evaluated in either an appropriate humanized animal model or non-human primates. The information learned
will contribute to our knowledge towards optimizing AAV-mediated gene transfer in humans. The new capsids
will be made available for use in clinical gene transfer/genome editing trials."

PFAS have emerged as national priority pollutants, and more than 2000 sites contaminated by PFAS have been
identified across the U.S., including 180 EPA-identified Superfund sites. Elevated human exposures to PFAS
have been associated with adverse health outcomes, including metabolic disruption, immunotoxicity, and
endocrine disruption, although exposure-dependence and individual vulnerability need to be better understood.
STEEP II builds on the successful collaborative it established within the first STEEP SRP Center (STEEP I) to
further advance the science, training, engagement and outreach in support of SRP mandates. STEEP II will
continue to collaborate with the RI and MA state and federal agencies, and will expand its reach to work with DE,
ME, NJ, and MI state agencies in support of their needs for knowledge on PFAS. The environmental engineering
and chemistry projects will focus on the transport and transformation of PFAS precursors, as well as legacy,
novel, and total PFAS. Novel detection tools will be developed and used to support remediation of PFAS-
contaminated groundwater, the atmospheric transport and fate of PFAS, and to predict bioaccumulation of PFAS
relative to modeling predictions. The Center will build on its leading research on the critical effects of PFAS in
children, with a focus on immunotoxicity and metabolism. Given the public health importance of breastfeeding,
STEEP II will focus on understanding cellular mechanisms that dictate PFAS uptake and elimination into milk
and accumulation in the infant, thereby advancing understanding of toxicokinetic mechanisms and potentials for
preventing PFAS from reaching human milk. STEEP II research projects, working with the Community
Engagement Core (CEC) and the Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC), will perform a thorough human
exposure assessment for PFAS and risk assessment. STEEP trainees and mentors will remain key to the
ongoing growth as a unified Center, via cross-cutting collaboration fostered by the Research Experience and
Training Coordination Core (RETCC), and joint mentorship. STEEP II will include an additional focus on Diversity,
Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) training for trainees and mentors alike. The STEEP II goals will address the following
Specific Aims:
 Specific Aim 1: Assess the distribution, transformations, and bioaccumulation of PFAS
 Specific Aim 2: Investigate the processes affecting PFAS distribution and uptake and assess critical
adverse effects in humans
 Specific Aim 3: Engage new and established stakeholders across multiple sites
 Specific Aim 4: Integrate STEEP internally and execute effective outreach and collaboration with
stakeholders"
10912555,"PROJECT SUMMARY: OVERALL
Cancer health disparities based on factors such as race and ethnicity are the result of a combination of
socioeconomic, environmental, behavioral, and biological factors. These disparities impact cancer incidence,
prevalence, mortality, survivorship, financial burden, and screening rates. The long-standing and mature Meharry
Medical College (MMC), Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC), Tennessee State University (TSU) Cancer
Partnership (MVTCP), continues to provide and expand upon an exceptional cancer research and training
environment to support the efforts of diverse investigators in addressing disparities. These efforts span across
multiple disciplines to study the determinants of cancer health disparities at an NCI-designated comprehensive
cancer center (VICC) along with enhancing research infrastructure, capacity-building, and impact at two minority-
serving institutions (MMC and TSU). Collectively, over the past twenty years of partnership, these collaborative
efforts provide a robust infrastructure to address and overcome cancer disparities while expanding research
opportunities, recruitment and training. Our Triad has benefited from sustained and strong collaborative
interactions between the three partner institutions, resulting in robust community and educational outcomes.
Moreover, the geographical placement of this Triad in Tennessee, a region with some of the highest cancer
incidence and mortality rates in the United States, also provides a unique opportunity for our Partnership to
positively impact outcomes for cancer patients in this geographical region. This region continues to have
significant cancer health disparities in lung, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers. In order to meet our ultimate
goals of overcoming cancer disparities while simultaneously strengthening research impact, the overall
objectives of this competing renewal application are to: 1) increase the participation in traditional, investigator-
initiated cancer research projects awarded to MMC and TSU faculty with collaborative guidance by senior VICC
faculty; 2) increase the number of investigator-initiated awards to VICC junior faculty that address cancer
disparities; 3) recruit, train and retain early-stage investigators to become independent leaders in cancer health
disparities and cancer research and training; 4) expand MVTCP participation in national oncology treatment and
interventional trials; 5) strengthen the physical and intellectual infrastructure for research at MMC and TSU; 6)
facilitate partnerships between community organizations and academic researchers, leading to hypothesis-
driven research projects that include the involvement of a community health educator; 7) increase the number

Delirium is a form of acute brain failure that occurs in 17% of older emergency department (ED) and 25% of
older hospitalized patients. Numerous studies have reported that delirium is significantly associated with
accelerated cognitive decline, particularly in patients with Alzheimerâs disease and related dementias (ADRD).
Even in cognitively intact older patients, 50% will develop incident ADRD at 6-months after an episode of
delirium. While interventions that efficaciously prevent delirium exist, there is no universally accepted
intervention for delirium after it has developed. Most studies have demonstrated that they have minimal effect
on outcomes including cognition. We posit that the lack of efficacy exists because these interventions modify
risk factors for delirium development rather than the adverse outcome itself. Additionally, these interventions
are uniformly administered to all delirious patients without taking into account this syndromeâs heterogeneity.
Many interventions are also initiated 24 to 48 hours after admission, further limiting their efficacy. To preserve
long-term cognition after delirium has developed, we must develop a novel and innovative approach to delirium
management that emphasizes early (<24 hours) identification of delirious patients at higher risk for poorer
long-term cognition and early modification of risk factors that are associated with accelerated cognitive decline.
Unfortunately, the data needed to develop such an approach is lacking. To address this dearth in data, we
completed several pilot studies that demonstrated that initiating cognitive training during hospitalization and
following up with cognitive rehabilitation for 12 weeks after hospital discharge can be feasibly implemented and
may improve cognitive outcomes. We also identified that delirious patients with normal arousal, more severe
symptoms, metabolic, infectious, and central nervous system etiologies, and higher serum biomarkers of
systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and blood brain barrier injury were also more likely to have
poorer 6-month cognition. It is possible that performing the cognitive intervention in delirious patients at higher
risk for poorer cognition may improve its efficacy and efficiency. To build upon our pilot studies, we propose
this R01 with the following specific aims: (1) Using a randomized control trial design, determine if early (<24
hours) cognitive training performed twice daily during hospitalization and cognitive rehabilitation performed
weekly for 12-weeks post-hospital discharge are associated with improved 6-month global cognition in older
delirious patients with and without ADRD. (2) Determine whether the cognitive training / rehabilitation
intervention is associated with improved network connectivity in the frontoparietal cortex at 6-months as
determined by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) compared with controls. (3) Perform latent class
analysis to identify delirium phenotypes and determine if they modify the relationship between early cognitive
training / rehabilitation and 6-month global cognition. To complete these specific aims, this R01 will enroll a
total of 336 patients and of these, approximately 235 will have pre-existing ADRD."

General anesthesia (GA) is a pharmacologically-induced state of unresponsiveness and unconsciousness which
millions of people experience every year. Despite its ubiquity, a clear and consistent picture of the brain circuits
mediating consciousness and responsiveness has not emerged. Assertions from non-invasive human studies
(i.e. EEG and brain imaging), modeling and animal studies implicate key cortical and subcortical brain areas
(including cortex, thalamus, and basal ganglia (BG)) during anesthesia. However, studies to date are limited by
the lack of direct recordings in humans from both cortical and subcortical regions with sufficient spatial, temporal,
and spectral resolution during pharmacologically-induced anesthesia. Our overall hypothesis is that the
mesocircuit model of consciousness, which was original proposed to characterize recovery after brain injury, can
be generalized to understand mechanisms of consciousness more broadly. The current research proposal
focuses on experimentally probing the mesocircuit in neurosurgical patients, taking advantage of differences in
patient populations with respect to basal ganglia disease (e.g., Parkinson disease [PD] vs essential tremor [ET]),
the ability to synchronously acquire high resolution BG and cortical neurophysiology, and the opportunity to
modulate the circuit in a targeted fashion with deep brain stimulation (DBS) to interrogate brain-behavior
relationships. We pursue three specific aims: Aim 1: To demonstrate that patients with underlying basal ganglia
pathology are more sensitive to propofol than other patients. Specifically, we will use target-controlled infusion
of propofol to characterize pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic parameters in patients with PD and ET to gain
insights into the potential role of BG circuitry in regulating consciousness, bearing on our more generalized model
of mesocircuit mediation of consciousness. Aim 2: To correlate temporal evolution of basal ganglia-frontoparietal
cortical circuit dynamics with behavioral correlates of induction and emergence from propofol anesthesia. We
will use high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution recordings in human subjects to provide direct evidence
of circuit function, temporal evolution, causal circuit flow, and brain-behavior correlates. Aim 3: To evaluate the
effects of targeted mesocircuit DBS (including both globus pallidus internus and externus) on propofol induced
loss and recovery of consciousness and responsiveness. The research is innovative in its use of natural
variations in neurological disease and concurrent invasive recording and stimulation in humans with a
mechanistic and causal study design. The proposed research is significant because it will demonstrate a complex
interplay of cortical and subcortical networks with partially separable effects of anesthesia, contrary to the most
common clinical approach of measuring a single, continuously scaled metric for depth of anesthesia. This
program will provide important human data to shed light on the generalizability of the mesocircuit model of
regulating consciousness as well as validate a human experimental model for further investigation and
characterization of anesthetic effects on the human brain."

 Radiation therapy (RT) is used in the curative setting for many cancers including sarcomas and lung and
pancreatic cancer. Despite significant improvements over the past few decades, there is still much room for
improvement as patients still develop RT-induced injuries or second malignant neoplasms. FLASH radiotherapy,
which delivers a large dose of radiation at an ultra-high dose rate could potentially reduce toxicity. Our overall
hypothesis is that Proton/Carbon Particle FLASH RT is superior to Standard Particle RT in protecting
normal tissues while the two modalities will be equipotent in controlling malignant growth.
 Project 1, which focuses on pancreatic cancer, will define the dosimetric and biophysical parameters that
will maximally spare normal intestine tissues using FLASH proton therapy (F-PRT) without compromising
antitumor effects. It will delineate mechanistic aspects of differential response of normal intestinal tissues, by
focusing on the relative sparing of the stem/progenitor cell population. Project 1 will also employ p53+/- transgenic
mouse models to dissect the genetic determinants of differential GI toxicity of Standard proton therapy (S-PRT)
vs F-PRT. Project 2 will explore the ability of F-PRT to ameliorate adverse events (inflammation, fibrosis,
lymphedema, changes to bone structure, radiation-induced cancers) that pose barriers to the treatment of
sarcomas with RT. We will also carry out a phase 1/2 trial that will treat canine patients with osteosarcomas
definitively with F-PRT. Project 3 will compare the efficacy of FLASH-RT given with carbon ion radiotherapy (C-
RT) vs. standard dose rate and compare it to electron F-RT. Studies will focus on the mitigation of normal tissue
injury in NSCLC with an emphasis on the impact of normal tissue and intratumoral hypoxia to response following
C-RT. Lastly, Project 4 will develop and validate the use of pencil beam scanning (PBS) technology for particle
F-RT. It will analyze spatiotemporal variations and SOBP (spread out Bragg peak) vs. shoot through PBS and
develop dose delivery algorithms for modeling biological effects for PBS-based FLASH proton therapy. These
tools will be incorporated in the experimental plans of project 1-3. These Projects are supported by 4 Cores
including an Administrative Core (Core A), Physics-Dosimetry Core (Core B), which will offer infrastructure
services to harmonize dosimetry between various sites and a Comparative Pathology core (Core C) for tissue
preparation for histopathological evaluation. Statistical services will be provided by Core D.
 Collectively, this highly integrated effort led by recognized leaders in Radiation and Tumor Biology, aims
to define the biological, dosimetric and biophysical parameters and molecular mechanisms under which FLASH
RT is most effective in tumors and tissues we deem the most likely to be first tested in clinical trials. It is our
belief that only by acquiring this knowledge will this exciting and novel modality be ushered into the
clinic in a safe and effective manner to improve therapeutic outcome and quality of life of cancer patients."

Orthopaedic infection is life-threatening and current treatments are only sparingly successful. Despite
aggressive peri-operative antibiotic treatments, 1.5% of knee revisions, 0.7 to 11.9%, of spinal infections
(depending on the complexity of the procedure) and up to 27% of open fractures become infected. Moreover,
the complexity of tissues interfacing with the biofilm-prone orthopaedic instrumentation complicates bacterial
eradication making current treatments prolonged and expensive. To address this serious issue, we propose to
combat the infection using cold plasma and cold plasma activated liquid (PAL). Our pilot data show that these
novel modalities can be tailored for high microbicidal activity coupled with immune stimulatory properties
without the risk of antibiotic resistance. Importantly, these modalities have not been used to combat bone
infections. To utilize this technology to address orthopaedic infection, a tri-partite consortium of international
research teams at the forefront of cold plasma technology from the US, the Republic of Ireland and Northern
Ireland have been assembled. This consortium unites expertise in plasma engineering, microbiology, material
science, chemistry, cell biology, and clinical medicine. There are three Specific Aims. (1) To determine the
effect of direct cold plasma treatment on MRSA biofilms and immune cell response; (2) To determine the
mechanisms of action, and efficacy of Plasma Activated Liquid (PAL) alone and in combination with direct cold
plasma treatment to eradicate infection; and (3) To resolve infection through combined cold plasma and PAL
treatments in a clinically relevant animal model of infected osteotomy. We will develop cold plasma and PAL
treatments that will directly disrupt biofilms and eradicate bacteria while stimulating the immune response. At
the end of this study, we will have developed a simple and effective non-antibiotic treatment protocol to cure
surgical site infection through combined immune activation and direct eradication of bacteria. Clinically, this
cold plasma+PAL treatment protocol can be seamlessly integrated with existing clinical protocols to enhance
and eventually replace our reliance on antibiotic therapies."

University (OHSU) and directed by seasoned MPIs Hammer and Olson. The Center is represented by OHSU,
Portland State University, and the University of Washington, and engages in multiple collaborations and
partnerships, including with TWH Affiliates and other TWH Centers of Excellence. We provide outreach and
education to OSHA Region 10 (Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and Idaho) and have national and international
impacts. We address TWH research, practice, policy, and capacity building in the NIOSH TWH priority areas of
1) Measuring Worker Well-Being; 2) TWH Outreach, Education, and Training; 3) Opioid and Other Substance
Use Disorders in the Workplace; 4) Future of Work; 5) Healthy Work Design and Well-Being; and 6) Workplace
Mental Health and Worker Well-Being. Our theme is Total Worker HealthÂ® intervention effectiveness and
translation to advance safe and healthy work design. The NORA cross-sector of most relevance to our
theme is Healthy Work Design and Well-being. The mission of the OHWC is to provide TWH outreach and
education to our region while conducting research on interventions that impact workforce and population
safety, health, mental health, and well-being. Our intervention effectiveness studies are informed by current
research evidence, the hierarchy of controls applied to TWH, and relevant theoretical models appropriate for
the specific problems and populations we address. As a Center with strong expertise in Occupational Health
Psychology, our projects are informed largely by knowledge of psychosocial stressors and the understanding
that work is a strong social determinant of health. We view the assessment and control of physical and
psychological workplace hazards as the foundations for implementing expanded and integrated TWH
approaches to workplace interventions. We address the NIOSH Strategic Goal 7: Promote safe and
healthy work design and well-being. Our direction for 2021-2026 is to continue filling a critical gap in the
TWH intervention field by demonstrating strong, effective TWH interventions as evidenced by large effect
sizes, program sustainability, and continued development of partnerships to promote dissemination,
implementation and translation into practice by our outstanding Outreach Core. We advance four new
proposed research projects led by new and continuing PIs (Bowles, Huang, Hurtado/Lenhart, and Olson).
These include one large randomized controlled trial of an intervention to reduce burnout and improve well-
being among health care workers; one large assessment of a natural intervention evaluating the impact of work
schedule changes on firefightersâ mental health and well-being; one large translational research project to
extend our successful COMPASS intervention to address chronic pain among home care workers; and one

11038653,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by dysfunction of the CF Transmembrane
Conductance Regulator (CFTR) channel. The care of patients with CF has rapidly evolved with the
development of CFTR modulators, novel pharmaceuticals that address the basic CF defect and restore CFTR
function. Despite the success of one of these, the potentiator ivacaftor, there is still pronounced variance in
drug efficacy, as measured in individualsâ phenotypic response to therapy and their in vitro cellular response
when assessed with cell-based biomarkers. Ivacaftor is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP3A enzymes),
which are responsible for both hepatic and tissue-specific metabolism, including in airway epithelia. Genetic
variation in these enzymes cause altered activity, resulting in variation in efficacy in many drugs. The
preliminary data demonstrate CYP3A variants may be associated with drug efficacy, and the ability to detect
ivacaftor metabolism in vitro in individual patientsâ epithelia that the applicant personally co-developed. To
maximize efficacy of ivacaftor, and thus, any therapy including it, it is essential to understand
pharmacogenetics and effect of variability of CYP3A enzyme activity on the metabolism of ivacaftor. The
Specific Aims are: 1) conduct a pilot study in people to determine population pharmacokinetics of ivacaftor in
plasma and epithelia, and correlate drug exposure with drug response 2) to determine frequencies of genetic
variants of these enzymes in the CF population and measure association with clinical efficacy; 3) compare the
contribution of CYP3A isoforms to ivacaftor metabolism and understand impact in primary epithelial cells on
CFTR activity. Ivacaftor is a significant component of many combination therapies, so understanding its
variation in metabolism and impact on efficacy is the first key step to understanding pharmacogenetics in
complex combinations, and will set the stage for an independent career focused on precision-directed
therapeutics in CF.

10792572,"Robert A. Saxton | K22 (PAR-18-467) | Project Summary / Abstract
 Although inflammation is essential for protecting organisms against infection, excessive or chronic
inflammation is also associated with an increased risk of certain cancers. This is particularly true at epithelial
barriers such as the colonic mucosa in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which are in frequent contact with the
external environment and therefore particularly susceptible to damaging inflammatory responses. Indeed, over
20% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) will go on to develop colitis-associated cancer (CAC).
Moreover, most therapeutic options for autoinflammatory diseases like IBD involve the use of
immunosuppressive drugs, which may also increase tumor incidence due to reduced immunosurveillance.
 An alternative approach is to exploit natural mechanisms of tissue protection and repair in order to
reduce tumor-promoting inflammation without suppressing anti-tumor immune responses. Recently, several
members of the IL-20 cytokine family have been shown to be upregulated in both IBD and GI cancers, but their
functional roles in these contexts are not fully understood. This includes the cytokines IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24,
all of which signal through the shared receptor subunit IL-20RÎ². However, whether this upregulation drives
disease pathology or reflects a beneficial but insufficient homeostatic response remains unclear. This is largely
due to the combinatorial and interconnected nature of receptor sharing within this family, resulting in a high
degree of functional pleiotropy and redundancy that hinders experimental interrogation of these pathways.
 In this project, we will employ structure-guided protein engineering to deconvolute the pleiotropic
functions of IL-20RÎ² ligands in inflammation-associated colon cancer. We will first use a combination of
directed evolution and structure-based rational protein design to develop a pharmacological toolkit, comprising
IL-20 receptor agonists and antagonists with altered receptor specificities, allowing us to selectively modulate
the activity of individual IL-20RÎ² ligands. We will then use these tools in vivo to probe the effect of these
engineered proteins in the development, progression, and gene expression changes over the course of colitis
induction and tumor progression, using the well-established AOM/DSS mouse model of CAC. Together, these
studies will provide important insights into the protective and pathogenic functions of distinct IL-20RÎ² ligands in
CAC, while also directly testing the therapeutic potential of our engineered cytokine variants in the prevention
of inflammation associated cancer."
10768538,"Project Summary
Of people admitted emergently to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in respiratory failure or shock, 50% to 70%
develop delirium (by far the highest in any healthcare setting). The duration of this delirium independently
predicts earlier death, longer hospital stay, and higher healthcare expenses annually. Delirium in ICU patients
has been shown to be the strongest potentially modifiable risk factor for development of a long-term cognitive
impairment, which resembles moderate to severe Alzheimerâs Disease and Related Dementias (ADRDs).
Thus, medical and surgical ICU patients on ventilators or in shock are a prime population in whom to study the
relationship between delirium and dementia. Our NIA-funded, NEJM published, and PAR-18-029 cited BRAIN-
ICU-1 study [Bringing to light the Risk factors And Incidence of Neuropsychological dysfunction in ICU
Survivors, 1st Study] showed over that one-third of ICU survivors (without preexisting dementia) emerged with
new cognitive impairments or ADRD at 1 year. Some BRAIN-ICU-1 patients had cognitive resilience against
ADRD, but others developed a persistent or progressive dementia-like illness. We are eager to develop
interventions against this ICU-related dementia, but without knowing more about this form of brain injury, we
are very limited. Now, we have pilot neuroimaging (MRI) data show that acute ICU delirium is associated with
atrophy of the whole brain, frontal lobe, and hippocampus, but this problem requires an in-depth investigation.
We know abnormal brain proteins (amyloid, tau) relate to Alzheimerâs disease, however, we know nearly
nothing about protein pathology or other causes of this ICU-related dementia. It is critical to understand why
ICU survivors are losing their jobs, and the leadership as matriarchs and patriarchs of their families. This
BRAIN-ICU-2 study [Bringing to light the Risk factors And Incidence of Neuropsychological dysfunction
(dementia) in ICU Survivors, 2nd Study] is in direct response to PAR-18-029 and will determine ICU patientsâ
main paths to decline, maintenance, or recovery of brain function. We will answer gaps in knowledge about
long-term outcome of post-ICU brain disease by following the remaining ICU survivors from the original
BRAIN-ICU-1 study with complete cognitive testing for the first time ever to 14 years (AIM 1). We will consent
and enroll 567 new ICU patients at Vanderbilt and Rush Universities (i.e., new ICU cohort) and determine how
detailed neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid samples can help reveal locations and mechanisms of injury
beyond what we learned from the clinical information collected in our original study (AIM 2). Importantly, we
are partnering with the world-renowned Rush Alzheimer's Disease Research Center brain bank program so
that all patients enrolled in Aims 1 and 2 will able to donate their brains to science for the first-ever in-depth
pathological study of those who do and do not get post-ICU dementia to define this disease formally (AIM 3)."
10543162,"Project Summary
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disease affecting Caucasian populations and
causes progressive pulmonary decline and multi-organ disease leading to premature death. Cystic fibrosis-
related diabetes (CFRD) affects up to half of adults with CF. Development of CFRD is associated with clinical
deterioration including decline in pulmonary function, compromised nutritional status, and increased mortality.
Insulin is the only recommended treatment for CFRD and has been demonstrated to improve clinical status
and decrease mortality. Patients with CF already carry a significant medical burden managing the pulmonary
manifestations of their disease, and the additional onus of frequent blood sugar monitoring and insulin
injections that accompanies CFRD often leads to a decline in quality of life and non-adherence. One of the
most promising strategies to improve glycemic regulation in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) is automation of
glycemic regulation with artificial pancreas (AP) devices. We have tested an AP device called the bionic
pancreas extensively in subjects with T1D and have shown that it simultaneously reduces both mean glucose
and hypoglycemia while reducing the work required for diabetes management and improving quality of life.
There are several unique features of the bionic pancreas that make it ideally suited among AP systems for use
in the CFRD population. The bionic pancreas rapidly and automatically adapts to a wide range of insulin
needs, making it well suited to address fluctuations in insulin requirements of those with CFRD that occur
during acute CF exacerbations and treatment with glucocorticoids. In addition, it is not necessary to
carbohydrate count or inform the bionic pancreas when a meal is going to be eaten to achieve good glycemic
control, which will be particularly useful for patients with CF who require frequent high calorie, high
carbohydrate meals and snacks to maintain an adequate nutritional status. Moreover, the bihormonal
configuration of the bionic pancreas, which can use micro-dose glucagon to prevent hypoglycemia when
suspension of insulin delivery is insufficient, may be particularly useful for prevention of hypoglycemia in
patients with CFRD, who are already at high risk for hypoglycemia due to pancreatic fibrosis leading to
glucagon deficiency. In this proposal we will test the ability of the bionic pancreas to control blood glucose
levels in subjects with CFRD with the following three aims: (1) We will test the short-term safety and efficacy of
two configurations of the bionic pancreas, bihormonal (insulin/glucagon) and insulin-only, versus usual care in
subjects with CFRD; (2) we will compare the long-term outpatient performance of the bionic pancreas versus
usual care over a period of 6 months and look for preliminary evidence of improvement in non-glycemic
outcomes such as pulmonary function, weight, and number of CF exacerbations; and (3) we will compare the
bionic pancreas to usual glycemic inpatient management in patients with CFRD during hospitalizations for CF
exacerbations, which are often associated with difficulty in glycemic management."

10538644,"Cognitive control refers to the ability to guide behavior in an intentional and goal-directed manner amidst
competing demands. This hallmark of human cognition is supported by the prefrontal (PFC) and posterior parietal
cortices (PPC), areas that have undergone extensive evolutionary expansion. The PFC and PPC are central to
integrating the present context with plans for the future in order to guide intentional behavior. Accordingly,
dysfunction of these regions leads to a wide-variety of deficits including inflexibility, inattention, impulsivity, and
disorganization. Such cognitive deficits are evident in numerous psychiatric and neurological disorders such as
schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, substance addiction, mood disorders, Parkinsonâs
disease, Huntingtonâs disease, stroke, and traumatic brain injury. However, impairments in cognitive control are
particularly challenging to treat in part due to insufficient mechanistic understanding of the PFC, PPC, and their
interactions. To understand and treat disorders of higher-level cognition we need to detail the directed
interactions of the PFC and PPC, elucidating functional chains among brain regions and behavior. However,
elucidating directed interactions in humans is challenging given limitations of available techniques. Animal
models may not translate to the PFC and PPC-mediated abilities that are exceptional in humans. As a result,
how the directed interactions of the PFC/PPC mediate higher-level cognition and how they can be manipulated
to model dysfunction and move towards rehabilitation remains unclear.
This proposal aims to fill this gap using a combination of techniques. Functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) will be coupled with computational techniques to model how directed PFC/PPC interactions support
cognitive control. Chief among the interests of this proposal are identification of putative hierarchical
organizations with the PFC and PPC that are symbolized by asymmetries of directed influence. Areas at the
apex of such hierarchies are predicted to exert widespread influence over other brain areas and cognition. Such
apical areas would therefore serve as important biomarkers to monitor for disorder progression, and targets for
treatment. Modeled apical roles will be causally validated using interleaved transcranial magnetic stimulation
(TMS) and fMRI by examining the impact of focal stimulation on downstream brain areas and behavior. Both
continuous theta-burst TMS (cTBS) and intermittent theta-burst TMS (iTBS) will be employed with putative
inhibitory and excitatory effects, respectively. It is predicted that cTBS will impair behavior, serving as a model
of dysfunction, while iTBS will enhance behavior, serving as a road towards treatment. Aim 1 will estimate
hierarchical models in the PFC, validate these models using cTBS, and start the path towards treatment using
iTBS. Aim 2 will apply a similar logic to the PPC and contrast the relative efficacy of PFC vs. PPC TMS.
Collectively, these aims will provide directed models of PFC/PPC interactions supporting cognitive control, and
causal data regarding how targeted manipulation of these networks can hinder or improve control."

competent care. In addition, TGW are 49-times at greater risk for HIV acquisition when compared to cisgender
men (CGM) and women (CGW) of reproductive age. Currently, a daily, fixed dose formulation of tenofovir
(TFV) disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC) (PrEP), has been used for the prevention of HIV
acquisition in persons at high risk of HIV infection. A less-frequent, on demand, four-dose regimen has also
proven highly effective in preventing HIV infection. While TGW have been enrolled in randomized controlled
PrEP trials, TGW have not been enrolled in sufficient numbers to robustly evaluate PrEP uptake and efficacy.
Importantly, the interaction of PrEP and GAHT drugs has not been well characterized. In vitro and ex vivo
studies suggest an influence of estrogen and, potentially reduced testosterone, on PrEP pharmacology.
Preliminary work by our group demonstrated greater than 30% reduction in plasma TFV and FTC AUC0-24 in
TGW on estrogen when compared to CGM. Because reducing the weekly TDF/FTC dose from seven to two
doses per week results in a sizeable drop in PrEP protection of anal sex from 90 to 75%, the change we
observed may be sufficiently large to impact PrEP outcomes in TGW on GAHT. Thus, to better characterize
the relationship between PrEP and GAHT, we propose a clinical drug-drug interaction between PrEP drugs
and estrogen-based GAHT in a stepwise and estrogen dose-dependent manner to quantify the magnitude of
drug interaction in blood, urine, and colorectal tissue. We will use these data, in conjunction with other clinical
trials data, to build a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model of PrEP efficacy. This will enable
clinical trial simulations to contrast daily and on demand PrEP dosing in the presence and absence of GAHT to
inform PrEP dose recommendations for TGW. Because we hypothesize that GAHT will decrease PrEP
concentrations and result in increased susceptibility for HIV infection, TGW on GAHT will likely require higher
or more frequent PrEP dosing than CGM who have sex with men. This work is a critical next step in ensuring
appropriate PrEP dosing to group at substantially higher risk of HIV acquisition, and informs the need and
design for future study of PrEP and GAHT from an efficacy, behavioral, and acceptability perspective."
10543809,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The past fifty years have seen substantial advances in the field of encapsulation of
insulin producing tissues for the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Persistent
obstacles and limitations of the current technologies have prevented translation of these
results to the clinical realm. Multiple groups are now poised for clinical translation, but
still lack adequate, easily retrievable delivery devices. One major obstacle is the
limitation of tissue loading in conventional encapsulation that results from the high
metabolic demand of native islets/SC-Î² and the concomitant mass transport limitations
of most encapsulation materials. Importantly, native islets experience oxygen and
nutrient deficit in loading densities greater than 1.5 to 2% v/v in standard alginate
microcapsules. In smaller capsules of alternate materials, mass transfer is impaired due
to monomer structure and cross-linking strategies. This adversely affects the benefit
afforded by the smaller diffusive distance.
 Fundamental aspects of cell encapsulation must be reexamined. Research
efforts have been focused on the in vivo application where reduction in device geometry
is crucial to clinical success through the reduction of oxygen transfer distances and
overall biomaterial/graft volume. There has been little study of pre-transplant culture
where hypoxia and loss of viability/function are the result of cell proximity to the plastic
basal surface. This causes cell death and results in antigen shedding. In vivo, the
opposite holds true where larger geometry results in increased chance of hypoxia at
clinically relevant loading densities. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that
impaired oxygen mass transfer results in increased hypoxia/anoxia, loss of
function, apoptosis and antigen shedding. This proposal seeks to address these
obstacles through the following specific aims: 1.) we will determine the effect of capsule
geometry and pre-implant culture methods on encapsulated islet/SC-Î² viability, function,
antigen shedding and in-vitro inflammatory response from co-culture with macrophages.
2.) we will employ oxygen carrying perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions in islet encapsulation
devices in immune-deficient, immune competent and autoimmune mouse models
(BALB/C, C57BL/6, NOD-SCID, NOD) with chemical induction (STZ) of diabetes to
ascertain the additive effect of each on engraftment and restoration of normoglycemia.

10565679,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Many 3-4 year olds with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who are `preverbal' (30-50%) do not go on
to develop socially related words and phrases by age 5-6 years and are reclassified as `minimally verbal',
never moving past 20 functional, non-echoed words, even with exposure to evidence-based early
interventions. Despite significant research of children older than 5 who are already classified as minimally
verbal, little research has attempted to optimize intervention for limited language preschool children who
may be more likely to develop language with appropriate, targeted, and personalized intervention
approaches. Therefore, a major gap in our knowledge remains on how to place these children with ASD on
a path to becoming verbal by school age, thus reducing the numbers of minimally verbal children. A key
challenge in this population is that one size does not fit all: there is vast heterogeneity in presentation and
response to intervention. To capitalize on this heterogeneity, it will be necessary to use an individually
tailored, sequential approach to intervention whereby treatment is adapted over time based on how the child
responds. The overarching goal of the proposed multi-site project is to maximize language outcomes for
preschoolers at risk for maintaining `minimally verbal' status by developing a two-stage, 20-week âadaptive
interventionâ (an intervention that incorporates a replicable sequence of treatment decision rules to guide
clinicians on when and how to alter an intervention). This study addresses key questions in designing an
adaptive intervention, including how best to intervene with children responding slowly to initial intervention,
which of four pre-specified adaptive interventions is best, which moderators are important to designing a
more individually tailored adaptive intervention, and better understanding the mechanism by which the
adaptive interventions may exhibit their effects. Specifically, the primary aim tests the effect of intensifying
stage 1 singular interventions versus changing intervention by systematically combining and enhancing
treatment modules. The stage 1 interventions include a commonly recommended approach based on
applied behavior analysis (discrete trial training) and an evidence-based early intervention that specifically
addresses the social communication impairment in ASD, JASPER (Joint Attention Symbolic Play
Engagement & Regulation). The primary outcome is spontaneous communicative utterances, and
secondary outcomes include joint engagement, receptive language, and presence of word combinations.
Our secondary and exploratory aims include moderator and mediator tests, and longitudinal outcome at age
5-6 years. Child participants include 140 4-year-olds with ASD and limited language (<20 functional words)
across 3 sites (U Oregon, Rochester, and UCLA). This study has the potential to dramatically improve
communication outcomes for children with ASD, and addresses a high priority need of the Interagency
Autism Coordinating Council and NIH."
10559655,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The proposed study (CAIT: Community-based Adaptive Autism Intervention for Toddlers) aims to
determine the most optimal sequence of interventions for improving the social- communicative, language and
cognitive outcomes of toddlers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The target population consists of 2-3 year
-old children with ASD who receive community based, publicly funded early intervention in two authentic
educational settings in East Harlem and the Bronx, NY known as New York Center for Infants & Toddlers
(NYCIT). An expected 300 toddlers with ASD will participate with their community-recruited paraprofessional
teaching assistants (TAs) and group leaders (GLs). The study aims to construct the most effective one-year,
two-phase, adaptive intervention, in which intervention is individualized based on a child's initial response to
intervention. Phase 1, from program entry to either 6 or 12 weeks (randomized), involves 60 minutes daily of
an evidence based social communication intervention, JASPER (Joint Attention, Symbolic Play, Engagement &
Regulation) delivered 1-on-1 to the child by the trained TA. At end of Phase 1, response to intervention is
rated by the GLs for slow or fast improvements of joint engagement (a core deficit in the early development of
children with ASD, and a significant indicator of good progress toward improving social communication and
language). In Phase 2 (to week 24), toddlers responding slowly are re-randomized to continue with JASPER
for 60 minutes per day or augment treatment with direct, structured teaching of social communication targets
for 30 minutes and JASPER for another 30 minutes per day. Toddlers responding quickly are given 30 minutes
of JASPER and 30 minutes of jasPEER (JASPER with a peer) to further improve socialization and social
communication.
 This study will employ a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design to evaluate
how best to improve social communication outcomes in toddlers with ASD over two treatment phases. The
primary effectiveness aim is to determine among slower responders, the effect of augmenting JASPER with
structured teaching vs. continuing JASPER on primary (social communicative utterances) and secondary
outcomes (joint engagement and play). Secondary effectiveness aims focus on (i) determining the best time
(week 6 or 12) to identify a child as a slower responder, and (ii) examining whether child un-engagement at
baseline moderates the effect of measuring response at week 6 or 12, and whether joint attention skills in
Phase 1 moderate the effect of Phase 2 treatment among slow responders (JASPER plus structured teaching
vs. continuing JASPER). Finally, an implementation aim will examine barriers and facilitators to intervention
adoption by NYCIT (by assessing implementation fidelity, refining our external support to center leadership to
reliably assess child response, train new staff, and coach TAs to implement intervention components with
fidelity, and to examine the degree to which NYCIT leadership sustains the interventions)."
10867382,"Abstract: Evidence suggests that exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as benzene, toluene,
ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX), trichloroethylene (TCE), and tetrachloroethylene (PCE), is an important
determinant of maternal-offspring health, with implications for preterm birth (PTB) and associated adverse
health outcomes. VOCs emanate from landfills, brownfields, and Superfund sites, contaminating shallow soils
and groundwater below residential, commercial, and industrial properties, leading to exposures via vapor
intrusion. The Center for Leadership in Environmental Awareness and Research (CLEAR) is dedicated to
understanding and mitigating this serious environmental health problem with a focus on post-industrial urban
centers. Headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, CLEAR will use Detroit as a study site, which has the highest PTB
rate in the country (15.2%) and is located in a state where 37 of the 67 Superfund sites must manage VOC
contamination. CLEAR hypothesizes that VOC exposure through vapor intrusion during early life incites
inflammatory responses in maternal tissues and/or the developing offspring that re-program the developing
immune and other critical systems, setting the stage for PTB and/or associated adverse health outcomes. Five
integrative environmental science and engineering and biomedical research projects (E1, E2, B1, B2, B3),
supported by five cores, will investigate toxic mechanisms, exposure pathways, biomarkers, and strategies to
prevent exposures and improve public health outcomes by: (1) developing and testing new detection
methodologies, including phytoscreening (E1); sensor technology that integrates Internet of Things and edge
computing for real-time contaminant detection and rapid-response, mitigation, and remediation (E2); and a
controlled toxicity bioassay using WSU-designed sealed chambers for evaluating reproductive, neurological,
behavioral, immunological and multigenerational responses in zebrafish (B1); (2) studying mechanistic effects
of VOC exposure in a pregnant mouse model (B2); (3) applying epidemiologic methods for estimating
exposure effects via human biological specimen analysis (B3); applying advanced chemical analysis, statistical
approaches and visualization tools to obtain and integrate project data (Chemical Analysis, and Data
Management and Analysis Cores), thereby establishing the impact of VOC exposures on PTB and associated
adverse health outcomes; (4) creating an innovative model for transdisciplinary education and workforce
diversity by engaging new trainees to solve complex environmental health problems (Research Experience
and Training Coordination Core); (5) engaging stakeholders and the community to inform our inquiry/analysis,
participate in sampling, and employ health interventions (Community Engagement Core); and (6) uniting
around an Administrative Core that conducts targeted research translation to ensure a legacy of scientific
awareness and supports the Superfund Research Program to improve public health in urban centers impacted
by environmental contamination to protect affected communities."

The UNM Metal Exposure and Toxicity Assessment on tribal Lands of the Southwest SRP Center
(METALS) focuses on >500 abandoned uranium mines (AUMs) on Navajo Nation, and the Jackpile Mine on
Laguna Pueblo, a legacy of the Cold War now being assessed under CERCLA. They represent >4500 AUMs
in the 15 Western US that are home to >1/2 of our Indigenous population. During the inaugural phase of
METALS, our team worked in close partnership with our Indigenous partners to determine that since mining
began in the 1940s, weathering of metal mixtures in the millions of tons of waste has produced nanoparticles
of varying mineralogy. While these nanoparticles have implications for both mobility and toxicity of the waste,
they are not considered in prioritization or clean-up due to significant data gaps. Our health studies have
shown that exposures to these metal mixtures increase the prevalence of hypertension, multiple chronic
diseases, and immune dysfunction, and autoantibody production. While ~25% of the population shows no
evidence of exposures, biomonitoring confirms an equivalent %age show exposure to clusters of up to 12
metals at significantly higher concentrations than the rest of the US population. Our community-partnered
approach and strong team integration inclusive of community partners has allowed our design of clinical
interventions that are scientifically sound and respectful of culture, in which we have high rates of participation
and compliance. Phase 2 of METALS will build on our strong community partnerships to drive our research by
their needs, and use single atom, state of the science, transmission electron microscopy to both answer
community questions on agricultural safety as impacted by particulate redistribution, and understand the
processes of resuspension, environmental mobility, and plant uptake at a mechanistic scale to inform risk
reduction. Our confirmation of multiple routes of exposures, and evidence of metals-induced inflammation and
oxidative stress lead us to examine contributions of ingestion and inhalation within community exposures.
These studies will explore the potential for high-dose exposures to immune regulatory cells in lung and gut to
alter systemic immune function, informing design of more targeted intervention. Our recognition of the role of
plant/fungi symbiosis in transformation of environmental metal mixtures has led to our collaboration with the
national Sevilleta Long Term Ecological Research program in New Mexico in development and testing of
fungal bioreactors based in the balance of native fungal communities and their interactions with geochemical
variables as a remediation strategy. These remediation approaches provide a novel strategy to overcome the
ineffectiveness of bacterial bioreactors in our oxic environment and produce sustainable, cost-effective
solutions to protect key resources of cultural importance. Our team will build on our strong partnerships to
build common dialogue with communities, researchers, clinicians, tribal and federal policy makers, informed by
our solution-oriented team science to inform risk reduction at community, clinical and policy levels."
10759419,"PROJECT SUMMARY (OVERALL)
Retrotransposable elements (RTEs) comprise ~45% of the human genome. Known as âmobile DNAâ they can
insert into new genomic locations using a 'copy and paste' mechanism. This process, retrotransposition, can be
deleterious at multiple levels, and has largely been viewed as molecular parasitism. Not surprisingly, host organ-
isms have evolved multiple silencing mechanisms to protect their genomes. This competitive and adversarial
relationship between RTEs and their hosts is evident in the evolutionary record of genome sequences. This
record is silent on the activity of RTEs in somatic tissues, since this information is not passed from one generation
to another, and RTEs were thought to be largely silent in somatic cells. However, in the past 10-15 years evi-
dence started emerging that somatic RTE activity is more frequent than anticipated, with members of this PPG
contributing important early evidence. Five years ago, this debate culminated in the submission of this PPG,
founded on the hypothesis that the somatic activation of RTEs represents a novel and hitherto unappreciated
molecular aging process. Our research program was designed to test this hypothesis and elucidate the underly-
ing mechanisms. The next five years saw a validation of this hypothesis, not just by our team, but also many
other groups. It is now apparent that with aging, multiple host defense mechanisms become compromised, and
repetitive sequences in general, not just active RTEs, increase their expression. As to the underlying mecha-
nisms by which this somatic onslaught 'can hurt us' we were in for a surprise: we discovered that RTEs dere-
pressed during aging, in particular LINE-1 (L1) elements, can generate cytoplasmically localized cDNA reverse
transcripts. These cDNAs are potent activators of a Type-I Interferon (IFN-I) response, which in turn stimulates
the innate immune system. We believe this leads to a phenomenon known as 'sterile inflammation' or 'inflam-
maging', a known hallmark of aging that has been implicated in a variety of age-related diseases. In a nutshell,
the host organism perceives RTE activation as an invading virus and mounts an appropriate anti-viral response
â unfortunately, given that the invader is embedded in our genomes, this response is futile and ultimately coun-
terproductive. Interestingly, the central nervous system (CNS) appears to be a 'privileged site' for RTE activity,
with relatively high levels of expression and ease of further upregulation. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that
RTE activation is associated with pathology, and in particular neuroinflammation. Neurodegenerative diseases,
and in particular dementias such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), are among the most devastating and feared
diseases of aging. The goal of this PPG will be to explore in detail the newly discovered somatic L1 lifecycles in
neuronal and non-neuronal cells of the CNS, the L1 surveillance mechanisms in the CNS, how they fail, the
consequences of that failure, and ultimately, how we can fix this. We will use human induced pluripotent stem
cell (iPSC) models as well as directly reprogrammed neurons, Drosophila and mouse models of AD, and human
postmortem tissue. F.H. Gage, a widely-known AD pioneer, joins the original PPG team on this quest."

Drug and alcohol use and addiction are heritable phenotypes that are leading causes of
morbidity and mortality worldwide. Hundreds of loci have now been strongly linked to
risk for substance use and addiction, and many more genes remain to be discovered.
Studies of impactful rare genetic variants are accelerating our understanding of genetic
influences of complex disease and producing compelling targets for intervention
research and drug development. The current proposal provides a framework by which
rare variants can be efficiently identified and evaluated in humans for their effects on
addiction using large and readily available datasets. Such datasets often have sparse
phenotyping, especially for behavioral and psychiatric phenotypes. Our proposed
framework overcomes this challenge through re-contact and reassessment of rare
variant carriers and their family members, allowing measurement of psychiatric
phenotypes far beyond that available in biobanks. We take full advantage of a
multidisciplinary team, advanced genomic technology, diverse analytical approaches,
and detailed deep phenotypic assessment on a sample of large extended families. We
will use large highly-powered GWAS and whole genome sequencing datasets to identify
rare putatively deleterious variants within substance-use-associated loci. Upon
functional validation of the rare deleterious variant in cell lines, we will use a novel
procedure to impute such variants into the Michigan Genomics Initiative Biobank,
thereby identifying carriers of rare deleterious alleles. These individuals, and their
families, will be re-contacted and receive standard and tailored assessments of their
substance use/dependence history, psychiatric, neurocognitive, and psychosocial
function. The proposed framework offers a new approach to investigate the human
biology underlying GWAS hits, identifying therapeutic targets and improving our
understanding of the etiology of addiction."

DESCRIPTION: Lipids are essential cellular components and act as mediators in cell signaling. The function of
lipids is determined by their structures. Dysregulated lipid metabolism is associated with a variety of
pathological conditions, including Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). The levels of lipids cannot be predicted by the
transcripts or proteins. To understand more about the role of lipids in the development of T1D, an important
first step is to directly measure the temporal changes of lipids in an organism that shares similar physiology
with human T1D. Built on our technological advancements in comprehensive global lipidomics, targeted
lipidomic analysis of lipid mediators, isobaric labeling-based multiplexed analysis of intact glycolipids and
determination of C=C unsaturation in intact lipids, in this project, we aim to profile the longitudinal changes of
the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse lipidome during different stages of T1D development by accomplishing
the following: 1) in-depth profile and accurately quantify the major lipids in T1D-pertinent tissues using global
lipidomics; 2) use advanced technologies to improve structural resolution, accurately identify and quantify
glycolipids and broadly profile bioactive lipid mediators; and 3) compare lipid expression profiles in different
tissues and characterize lipidome remodeling during different stages of T1D development. Successfully
accomplishing these goals will not only provide invaluable resource to the research community interested in
the role of lipids in the development of T1D, but it will also provide better practices for conducting lipidomics
research in general."

The mission of the Center for Limb Loss and MoBility (CLiMB) is to preserve, restore, and enhance functional
mobility, independence, and participation in Veterans with lower limb loss or other musculoskeletal impairments.
CLiMB serves Veterans with mobility disabilities arising from medical comorbidities or post-service trauma, as
well as those with injuries sustained while on active duty, including small but important cohorts of women and
other under-represented minorities. CLiMB accomplishes this mission by conducting innovative and rigorous
research; disseminating discoveries to Veteran patients and providers, VA leadership, and other stakeholders;
and translating knowledge and devices into clinical care. CLiMBâs nationally and internationally recognized
Principal Investigators are a multidisciplinary group of clinician-scientists, engineers, biomechanists, and
epidemiologists. The Centerâs scientific approaches and research Focus Areas span basic science, through
engineering design and development, to applied clinical research. CLiMBâs research Focus Areas are rooted in
the parallel importance of studying (1) Prevention of impairment onset and progression, (2) Innovative mobility
device development, (3) Evidence-based treatment and rehabilitation interventions, and (4) Personalized
surgical and prosthetic/orthotic treatment interventions. Focus Area projects are conceived through a synergistic
collaboration with patients, clinicians, clinician-scientists, and scientists both within and outside the Center who
identify and define unmet clinical needs in our Veteran patients. Project success is achieved through CLiMBâs
clinical translational pathway where projects often begin in a Discovery or Innovation phase and culminate in
clinical Translation. Consequently, the Center has placed a significant emphasis on ensuring that its research
and innovations have a demonstrated clinical need and a pathway to translation to ensure that Veterans benefit
directly from its work. CLiMB Translation can take on different forms (knowledge and devices) including evidence
to support clinical practice guidelines, physician decision support tools, patient decision aids available at the
point of care, and collaborations with industry to commercialize devices that are made available to Veterans.
CLiMBâs success and achievements are the result of unique laboratory and intellectual resources that cut across
our Focus Areas. These Core resources accelerate and facilitate the collaborative work of internationally
renowned clinicians and scientists with complementary expertise in rehabilitation science, engineering, and
clinical care. These resources have been cultivated by our Center for years, and with this renewal we are further
formalizing their structure, leadership, and purpose to include the following seven Cores: (1) Biomechanics &
Basic Science, (2) Imaging & Motion Analysis, (3) Computational Modeling, (4) Rapid Prototyping, (5) Clinical
Study Design, Epidemiology, & Biostatistics, (6) Novel Technologies & Applications, and (7) Administration &
Protection of Human Subjects. CLiMBâs future work will take a major step forward based upon the interim
evolution of engineering discoveries, unique to CLiMB resources, and the emergence of validated innovation
and decision support tools. In 2021, the Center has ten PIs who are committed to finding new ways of treating
Veterans with lower limb loss or other musculoskeletal impairments and translating these findings to the point of
Veteran care. Its planned innovative studies will harness novel technologies and applications including: the
unique aspects of 3D printing, musculoskeletal simulation, and prosthetic emulation to develop novel and
personalized approaches to prosthetic/orthotic prescription; state-of-the-art imaging and motion analysis
techniques to understand and treat orthopedic maladies; decision support tools for amputation-level shared
decision making to maximize functional outcomes; and cutting edge rehabilitation strategies to optimize healing
and reduce pain. CLiMB will accomplish this mission while continuing its commitment to the training of the next
generation of investigators."

Pancreatic cancer remains a lethal disease with limited therapeutic options. Options have increased over the

to surpass deaths from breast, prostate and colorectal cancer by 2030, to become the second leading cause of
cancer deaths. The incidence is rapidly increasing, with, a 23% increase since 2010 and 57% increase since
2006. The etiology and reason for the recent rise remain poorly understood with a complex interplay of somatic
genetic, genomic, epigenetic and environmental factors in the context of an aging population.
Unlike many solid tumors, mutations alone have not been sufficient to yield curative targeted therapies,
clinically useful biomarkers or consensus subtypes. Challenges that remain include:
 Â· Low tumor cellularity hampers both genetic and genomic studies, including the inability to identify
 biomarkers/subtypes to tailor therapies
 Â· Chemotherapy and targeted therapy resistant tumor cell populations
 Â· Desmoplastic stroma that may be both tumor promoting and therapy inhibiting
 Â· Immunosuppressive environment due to suppressive myeloid cells and a paucity of T effector cells
 Â· Precision oncology approaches are still limited

10852793,"HARVARD CENTER FOR WORK, HEALTH AND WELL-BEING: OVERALL SUMMARY
This renewal of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health Center for Work, Health, and Well-being
responds to a significant need for understanding of the impact of conditions of work on worker safety,
health, and well-being, and translating research findings into policy and practice. The mission of the Center
is to protect and promote worker safety, health, and well-being through integrated workplace policies,
programs, and practices that foster safe and healthy conditions of work. Building on our systems-level
conceptual model centered on the conditions of work, we will expand our focus on social and health
disparities, deepen our understanding of contributors to work-related well-being and mental health
indicators, and generate and apply research evidence to advance policy and practice recommendations to
improve workplace conditions. We will build on well-established productive partnerships among Harvard,
Boston College, Northeastern University, Mass General Brigham, Boston University, HealthPartners, and
MA Department of Public Health; a new partnership with Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and an
array of regional and national employers and stakeholder groups. Our aims focus on four critical areas:
(1) Research: The Center will expand the scientific evidence base for protecting and promoting worker
safety, health, and well-being through three large and one small research projects, encompassing etilogic,
intervention, and surveillance research across healthcare, warehouses, and construction. The planned
research includes a new focus on older workers and examines factors associated with thriving from work.
(2) Planning and Anticipating Emerging Issues: To accelerate the acquisition and application of research
evidence to inform policy and practice, the Centerâs Evaluation & Planning Core will be the locus of overall
scientific leadership activities. The Center includes a new Emerging Issues Program that will enable the
Center to rapidly respond to new research, policy, and capacity-building priorities. (3) Research to Practice
and Capacity Building: The Center will advance adoption and implementation of Total Worker HealthÂ®
(TWH) through dissemination of resources, best practices, and capacity-building approaches to improve
conditions of work. The Center will collaborate with stakeholders, dissemination and implementation
partners, and other TWH Centers and affiliates to synthesize key findings and provide guidelines and
recommendations. The Center will prepare the next generation of transdisciplinary TWH researchers and
build capacity for enterprises to implement TWH. (4) Policy: The Center will advance adoption of evidence-
based workplace and public policies that foster supportive conditions of work and protect and promote
worker safety, health, and well-being. The Centerâs Policy Working Group will identify research priorities and
opportunities and ensure that research findings are used to guide workplace and public policies."

Dysregulation of the immune system can have severe consequences on health and wellbeing. Although this is
often a complex process, recent progress in human genetics has allowed for the identification of single gene
variants that are strongly associated with immune dysregulation. Here, in this program project grant three
complementary teams will be working together to further unravel how heterozygous mutations that lead to gain
of function activity (GOF) of the STAT3 gene can strongly predispose to disease. Moreover, through our efforts
we hope to discover potential new methods to reverse this defect. This program project will have three highly
collaborative and interactive projects headed by Drs. Megan Cooper, Mark Anderson, and Alex Marson
along with two scientific cores. The major themes of the grant are:
1. More refined analysis of the immune cell dysfunction in STAT3 GOF patients
2. Using state of the art animal modeling approaches to interrogate STAT3 GOF mutations in triggering
 skin inflammation and type 1 diabetes
3. Utilizing state of the art CRISPR/Cas9 methods to interrogate STAT3 GOF dysfunction
4. Modeling methods to genetically repair defective STAT3 in human cells
The long-term objectives of this work are to improve our understanding of how STAT3 can serve as a tunable
rheostat to control immune tolerance and immune dysregulation. Results of these studies will help further
refine our understanding of autoimmunity inflammation and help improve methods for its treatment and
diagnosis."
10599073,"Background. Medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) prevents overdoses and improves mortality in
Veterans with OUD, but retention on MOUD is critical for achieving those clinical endpoints. Only 50% of
Veterans are retained on MOUD at 6-months post-MOUD initiation. Poor engagement in additional needed
care services is an important risk factor for early MOUD discontinuation. Consequently, providersâ ability to
identify Veterans in need of additional care or support while on MOUD may increase the likelihood of Veteransâ
continued use of MOUD. Valid predictive models can provide an accurate probability of an individual Veteran
experiencing the outcome being modeled (e.g., MOUD discontinuation). Prediction of future MOUD
discontinuation risk could provide an innovative and real-time method for identifying Veterans in need of
additional care (e.g., peer support). Significance/Impact. Predictive models could be used to lower MOUD
attrition risk and improve outcomes for this Veteran population by continuously monitoring their risk of MOUD
discontinuation in real-time during active MOUD treatment and identifying those Veterans in need of additional
care (e.g., if increasing risk between visits, providers might add peer support services to a treatment plan).
Innovation. This CDA-2 encompasses three HSR&D research priority areas (opioid/pain, health care
informatics, and access to care) while crosscutting HSR methods of âbigâ data and implementation science, all
in an effort to improve care and outcomes for Veterans with OUD. This study will also be the first to develop
and pilot test a clinical decision support tool (CDST), based on a predictive model, to improve Veteransâ MOUD
retention. Specific Aims. (1) To develop and validate PREMMOUD, a PREdictive Model for MOUD
discontinuation. Hypotheses: (H1) I will develop a predictive model with good discrimination (e.g., c-statistic, a
measure of goodness-of-fit, â¥0.8) for identifying Veterans likely to discontinue MOUD within the initial 6 months
of treatment; (H2) the model generated using neural network techniques will have better discrimination than the
models generated using random forest and logistic regression techniques. (2) To adapt PREMMOUD into a
CDST to continuously monitor risk of MOUD discontinuation and provide clinical guidelines for addressing the
primary risk factors driving the PREMMOUD score. (3) To assess (a) the feasibility of conducting a large scale,
randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test PREMMOUD CDSTâs (P-CDST) effectiveness as well as (b) P-
CDSTâs acceptability among waivered providers. Hypotheses: (H3) The feasibility of conducting a large-scale
RCT to evaluate P-CDSTâs effectiveness will be supported; (H4) P-CDST will be acceptable among VHA
waivered providers. Methodology. Using machine-learning methods and data from the VHA Corporate Data
Warehouse (2006-2019), I will train and validate PREMMOUD in a national sample of Veterans initiating
MOUD (Aim 1). For Aim 2, I will conduct two rounds of focus groups with key stakeholders (VHA providers,
Veterans receiving MOUD, VHA operations partners) to inform the creation of a beta-version of P-CDST to be
integrated into CPRS/Cerner. To build P-CDST, I will use VHA CDW data, PREMMOUD, SQL Server
Reporting Services (SSRS) and the Business Intelligence Service Line (BISL) platform. P-CDST will contain
the patientâs real-time PREMMOUD score as well as clinical guidelines to support the provider in addressing
the Veteranâs specific risk factors driving the PREMMOUD score. For Aim 3, I will conduct a single-arm, two-
site pilot trial to assess study feasibility (provider enrollment, frequency of P-CDST use, and follow-up rates)
and P-CDSTâs acceptability (clinical usability of P-CDST). Implementation/Next Steps. Aim 1 will support an
HSR&D IIR submission in Year 3 to assess whether PREMMOUD can be used to identify which Veterans,
receiving MOUD, can effectively be treated in specialty care versus non-specialty care and which Veterans
benefit from additional supportive services. A second IIR proposal will be submitted post CDA-2 to conduct an
RCT, using a hybrid design, to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation potential of P-CDST in VHA."

Developing HIV envelope (Env) immunogens capable of eliciting antibodies (Abs) effective against a broad array
of HIV-1 isolates is a major challenge in HIV vaccine development. Indeed, factors contributing to the generation
of broadly reactive Abs with neutralizing and/or nonneutralizing activities are not understood. This proposal will
test the concept that induction of Abs against HIV Env is influenced by the presence of anti-Env Abs that form
immune complexes (ICs) and that consequently modify epitopes on Env. Specifically, we hypothesize that
administration of an IC vaccine made of Env and select anti-Env monoclonal Ab (mAbs) will shape epitope
specificity, dominance, and maturation of de novo Ab responses to Env. Our earlier studies have shown that
anti-Env mAbs can be used to direct vaccine-induced endogenous Ab responses toward or away from certain
Env epitopes; this activity is dictated by the mAb's fine specificity. Immunization of mice with subtype B gp120
in complex with an anti-CD4-binding site (CD4bs) mAb elicited high-affinity Ab responses skewed toward the V3
crown, while an IC made with an anti-V3 mAb blocked induction of V3 crown-specific Abs. In contrast, IC made
of gp120 CRF01.AE A244 and anti-V2 mAb 2158 induced a higher Ab response to V1V2 compared to
uncomplexed A244 gp120, and allosteric effects inherent to this IC resulted in higher reactivity with V1V2 apex-
specific mAb PG9. Of note, ICs made with novel constructs of stabilized Env trimers (UFO or 1KNC) and V2
mAb 2158 were similarly more reactive with PG9 than their uncomplexed counterparts. PG9 binding was also
enhanced upon IC formation with a combination of anti-V2 mAb 2158 and anti-V3 crown mAb 2558, thus offering
a strategy to better target the V1V2 apex while occluding the V3 crown. These results provide a compelling
rationale for further evaluation of the potential advantages of IC vaccines. This application proposes to evaluate
trimeric Env IC vaccines in rabbits and rhesus macaques for the capacity to augment the induction of
multifunctional Abs against epitopes in the V1V2 apex and to limit Ab responses to the immunogenic V3 crown.
To this end, in Aim 1, we will initially test IC vaccines made of UFO and 1KNC Env constructs and V2 mAb 2158
plus/minus V3 mAb 2558 in rabbits, followed by down selection of the best UFO IC and the best 1KNC IC in
rhesus macaque immunogenicity studies. The vaccines will comprise of ICs and UFO Env DNA delivered
simultaneously. In Aim 2, we will compare in macaques whether an IC vaccine made with F(ab')2 is as effective
as an IC made with intact IgG in directing Ab responses to the V1V2 apex and away from the V3 crown. This
aim will assess the importance of Fab vs Fc to IC immunomodulatory activity. mAbs with rhesus Fc will be used
in all macaque experiments. Finally, Aim 3 will test whether co-immunization with UFO DNA and IC that elicits
Abs with polyfunctional antiviral activities can block or control SHIV infection. At the completion of this study, we
will better understand the utility of IC vaccines to modulate Ab response against specific regions of HIV Env. The
data will be useful in developing a clinically applicable strategy to produce effective HIV vaccines."

 There is an urgent need to find and accelerate approval of Alzheimerâs disease (AD) prevention therapies.
Aducanumab is an antibody that binds selectively to amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) oligomers and fibrils. In a Phase 1b trial of
clinically affected AD patients with AÎ² plaques, it dramatically reduced AÎ² plaque burden and appeared to slow
cognitive decline. Alzheimerâs Prevention Initiative (API) and Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic
Alzheimerâs (A4) Trials leaders have come together to propose a 24-month, multicenter, double blind, placebo-
controlled prevention trial of aducanumab using AD biomarker endpoints as primary outcomes, along with
cognitive/clinical, safety, and tolerability outcomes, in cognitively unimpaired 65-80 year-old AÎ² PET+ persons
stratified for presence or absence of the APOE4 allele. We will continue the blinded, randomized treatment past
24 months until we learn the results of the ongoing Phase 3 aducanumab program in persons with early AD. If
the Phase 3 program shows significant cognitive and/or clinical benefit and also shows that aducanumabâs AÎ²
PET effects, alone or in combination with downstream biomarker effects, are associated with clinical benefit, and
our 24-month trial showed identical biomarker effects, the findings would be used to support aducanumabâs
âaccelerated approvalâ in unimpaired AÎ²+ persons based on those biomarker effects; in doing so, it would
advance the potential use of surrogate biomarker endpoints to rapidly test prevention therapies in almost
everyone at biomarker or genetic risk. At that point, participants would receive open-label treatment and Biogen
would conduct post-marketing studies following FDAâs guidance to confirm that the treatmentâs 24-month
biomarker are associated with subsequent clinical benefit, as required under the FDAâs accelerated approval
provisions. Our deliberately ambitious proposal is intended to 1) find an approved prevention therapy as early
as 2023, ahead of the National Plan to Address ADâs goal to âprevent AD by 2025,â and 2) advance the use of
surrogate biomarkers to rapidly test and support accelerated approval of prevention therapies in almost everyone
at biomarker or genetic risk, even in earlier preclinical AD stages when some treatments may have their greatest
benefit. However, if the Phase 3 program does not show significant benefit, the stakes would be even higher for
our trial, since the question would remain whether intervention before clinical stages of AD is necessary to attain
benefit. We would modify the trial by using the Preclinical Alzheimer Composite Endpoint-Revised (PACC-R) as
the primary outcome and continuing blinded treatment until the last participantâs 48-month visit, clarify whether
the treatmentâs 24 month biomarker effects are associated with subsequent cognitive benefit, and seek to
achieve our goals by 2025. Regardless of the Phase 3 results, the proposed trial offers an unprecedented chance
to find, approve and support the availability of prevention therapies as soon as possible. It would capitalize on a
public-private partnership, NIH support, $5-10M in philanthropy, access to aducanumab and most of the financial
support from Biogen, provide a public resource of data and samples, and have the maximum public benefit."

Asthma affects over 300 million individuals worldwide. An estimated $81.9 billion dollars were spent on the
diagnosis and management of asthma in the U.S. in 2013. Uncontrolled asthma is associated with a doubling of
direct costs; it has been estimated that 20% of the subjects with asthma contribute 80% of the economic costs of
asthma. For severe asthma, multiple new FDA approved biologic therapies exist, but they remain very expensive
and there are a significant proportion of nonresponders. Current biomarkers may not distinguish reliably between
responders and non-responders; ~40% of those expected to respond continue to have exacerbations and ~40%
of those not expected to respond become symptom free. In this proposal, we will use novel genomics approaches
to assess and predict responses using therapy-induced phenotypes across a spectrum of asthma severity and
endotypes. We hypothesize that comprehensive characterization using clinical metrics, âomicsâ approaches, and
novel systems biology approaches will generate more precise treatment response biomarkers, further define
disease heterogeneity, and uncover novel biologic mechanisms as related to the therapy of moderate to severe
asthma. To address this hypothesis, we have specified three specific aims, centered around the combination of
a well-characterized, within-person evoked phenotype clinical cohort, including subjects with both type 2 (i.e.
those expected to respond based on current biomarkers) and non-type 2 moderate to severe asthma, to anti-IL5
(benralizumab) and anti-IL4/IL13 (dupilumab) with deep genomic interrogation, including single cell and bulk
RNA sequencing in both sputum and blood across each of the biologic interventions. The first aim will be to
identify, and subsequently validate, pharmacogenomic transcripts that predict response to each therapy, thereby
yielding clinically relevant biomarkers for response to asthma biologics. Our second aim takes advantage of the
biologic interventions as immunomodulators of specific pathways serving as âhuman knockdown modelsâ to elicit
the underlying mechanistic response at the level of the single cell to the biologic therapies. The final aim will
provide novel insights into cohort via the characterization of genomic signals that influence clinical asthma
subtypes and via the identification of molecular endotypes, which will be compared to the tradtional clinical
subtypes and evaluated for their response to the biologics. Analyses for each aim with include both traditional
statistical models as well as novel systems medicine and network biology approaches. The strengths of our
study include a melding a unique longitudinal clinical evoked phenotype cohort with state of the art genomics
analyses. Successful completion of this study will drive understanding of severe asthma response to biologics
to an unprecendented level, provide novel therapeutic biomarkers leading to direct clinical application, and detail
previously unknown cellular and genomic pathway mechanisms underlying severe asthma."

Improved understanding of community level determinants of perinatal health disparities is a research priority for
national health agencies. Community violence may contribute to adverse maternal and infant outcomes and may
be instrumental in explaining disparities in perinatal health by race/ethnicity and foreign-born status. However,
research has been substantially hampered by cross-sectional designs and methods that cannot disentangle the
effects of community violence from other highly correlated determinants of health. Thus, there is a critical need
for rigorous research to determine the effects of different aspects of community violence, both predictable overall
levels and unexpected acute changes, and to identify underlying psychological, behavioral and biological
mechanisms of effect that contribute to maternal and infant health and disparities. The overall objective of this
application is to test the central hypothesis that community violence increases the burden of and disparities in
maternal and infant health outcomes, and that potentially modifiable psychological (mental health, social
support), behavioral (substance use) and biological (maternal infections and conditions) mechanisms underlie
these effects. This hypothesis is supported by preliminary analyses that find trimester-specific violence is related
to preterm delivery, with the strongest effects among African Americans. The central hypothesis will be
addressed using data-adaptive quasi-experimental matching and fixed-effects methods and a rich covariate set
to accurately determine the effects of community violence on maternal and infant health. Analyses will be
conducted with over 6 million mothers and infants from statewide data on California (2005-2017) and survey-
based data on a representative sample of over 72,000 of these mothers and infants. The proposed research will
address the following specific aims: (1) Quantify the impacts of acute changes in community violence on maternal
and infant health disparities, and psychological, behavioral and biological mechanisms that explain the impacts;
(2) Determine the effects of the overall levels of community violence on maternal and infant health disparities,
and psychological, behavioral and biological mechanisms that underlie the effects. The work is innovative in (a)
distinguishing effects of overall levels of violence from acute changes in violence, (b) examining potentially
modifiable mechanisms, and (c) estimating population effects of potential interventions on violence and the
mediators. The research is expected to increase scientific understanding of the broader impacts of violence and
its role in shaping health disparities. In addition, this work is expected to identify the mechanisms that explain
the effects of violence on maternal and infant health, uncovering why racial/ethnic groups such as Latinas appear
to be protected, and potentially suggesting alternative points for intervention. Together, these findings are
expected to have an important positive impact because they will reframe violence as affecting health and
racial/ethnic disparities broadly and thereby motivate interventions to reduce violence and mitigate its
downstream effects, which will enhance health and reduce health disparities in the US."

This is a K08 Mentored Clinician Scientist Research Career Development Award application for Bryce Chiang, MD PhD.
Upon completion of ophthalmology residency, Dr. Chiang will be hired as an Assistant Professor of Ophthalmology at the
Byers Eye Institute at Stanford. The purpose of this application is to provide Dr. Chiang with the needed training, mentorship,
and support to become an investigator with expertise in ocular drug delivery, specifically to the optic nerve head. A clinical
glaucoma fellowship will be completed during the 25% clinical time through the timeline of the K08 award. Dr. Chiang has
assembled a mentorship team consisting of Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg, an expert on optic nerve neuro-protection and neuro-
regeneration; and Dr. Mark Prausntiz, an expert in ocular drug delivery. In addition, he has identified key collaborators
including Dr. Uday Kompella, an expert in ocular drug delivery; Dr. Joyce Liao, an expert in optic nerve diseases and animal
models; Dr. Jonathan Lin, an ocular pathologist; Dr. Vinit Mahajan, a vitreoretinal surgeon.
Optic neuropathy is a class of devastating vision threatening diseases that affect the optic nerve. There are no methods to
selectively deliver therapeutics to the optic nerve head, and targeted delivery could improve outcomes due to physiologic
spatiotemporal cues and/or selective targeting of injured tissue. The proposed technique is to access the optic nerve head by
a SupraChoroidal-to-Optic-NErve (SCONE) injection. The central hypothesis is that the SCONE injection technique can
be used to selectively target optic nerve head, and that therapies delivered with this method will be more efficacious
compared with intravitreal or intraorbital optic nerve injections. The hypothesis of Aim 1 is that SCONE injection can be
further optimized, and the technique will not impact the optic nerve head tissue functionally or structurally. The hypothesis
of Aim 2 is that SCONE injection will be more localized to optic nerve head than intravitreal or intraorbital optic nerve
injections. The hypothesis of Aim 3 is that Ciliary NeuroTrophic Factor (CNTF) delivered to the optic nerve headâeither as
free protein, or in a sustained release polymer, or transducing local cells with AAVâwill bring greater neuroprotection and
regeneration than intravitreal or intraorbital injections after optic nerve injury. The research may lead to improved delivery
techniques to the optic nerve head, and will form the basis of an R01 application before the end of the K award."

Sensorineural hearing loss affects 20% of the population in the United States at all ages. A normal acoustic
sense requires a variety of cells in the inner ear, in the brain and on neuronal pathways. In the inner ear,
stereocilia on the apical surface of hair cells function as biological mechanical switches, and their degeneration
is one of the causes of sensorineural hearing loss. Presently, there are no clinically useful treatments to
regenerate or repair damaged stereocilia. In this K99 proposal, I describe my ongoing and future studies using
single-molecule microscopy techniques (1) in live hair cells and (2) in stereocilia F-actin cores. I am also
developing (3) a novel mouse line to visualize the developmental transition of nascent microvilli to mature
stereocilia and to identify novel candidate âdeafness genesâ. Single-molecule microscopy in live hair cells has
already yielded a novel model to explain the molecular dynamics in stereocilia and succeeded in detecting
abnormal kinetics of mutant molecules. With these techniques, I introduce the concept of âsingle-molecule
functional analysisâ to hearing research and analyze the functions of âdeafness geneâ variants discovered in
families segregating hearing loss. The training objective in this K99 award is to develop novel microscope
methodologies. Specifically, I will develop single-molecule microscopy in live stereocilia by learning diSPIM
light-sheet microscopy and new ways of high-resolution imaging using deep learning from Dr. Hari Shroff
(NIBIB/NIH), my co-mentor, who is a world-renowned engineer of novel microscopes. I will learn cryo-electron
microscopy (CryoET) from Dr. Dennis C. Winkler (NIDCD/NIH) to localize single molecules in F-actin cores
and STED super-resolution microscopy from Dr. Christian A. Combs (NHLBI/NIH) to visualize the change of
molecular dynamics using my novel mouse models that I am establishing in the laboratory of my NIDCD/NIH
mentor, Dr. Thomas B. Friedman. The research aims during the mentored (K99) phase are to elucidate the
molecular dynamics of stereocilia components using these advanced microscope techniques. Single-molecule
microscopy in live stereocilia will visualize dynamics over the short time span of seconds to minutes. Two other
techniques, CryoET and STED in combination with our novel mouse line, will elucidate dynamics over a longer
time span during repair processes and development. Molecular dynamics elucidated by these techniques will
be a control to detect abnormal functions of âdeafness geneâ variants as I provide in the preliminary data
section. The aim during the independent (R00) phase is to identify and study candidate âdeafness genesâ and
potential therapeutic targets for human deafness. I will use my novel mouse model to study the cessation of
treadmilling during the transition of microvilli to stereocilia. By combining transcriptomics, I will identify
molecules localized in microvilli which have ceased normal F-actin treadmilling as they transit to nascent
stereocilia. With these microscopy techniques, I will (1) establish a pipeline to analyze functions of stereocilia
molecular components and (2) reveal therapeutic targets for sensorineural hearing loss."

Biliary tract disease and inflammation, including pediatric biliary atresia and primary sclerosing cholangitis, are
leading causes of liver failure. Chronic biliary inflammation, which can be associated with the presence of
gallstones, is a risk factor for development of cholangiocarcinoma, a rare but deadly malignancy. Acute
inflammation of the gallbladder, or cholecystitis, accounts for 20% of all biliary tract disease hospitalizations,
usually requires surgical intervention and has significant mortality if left untreated. Together, biliary tract disease,
including common gallstones, represents an enormous human health burden. Biliary tract inflammation plays
clear roles in progression of various common and rare biliary diseases, however our understanding of
inflammation and immune processes within the biliary tract are exceedingly limited.
The resident immune cell populations in the extrahepatic biliary tree at homeostasis have never been
characterized, and whether host or environmental factors can influence the development of the biliary niche has
never been explored. It is unknown if resident biliary immune cells could impact development and progression
of biliary disease. During my postdoctoral training, I developed a reproducible tissue digest method that yields
highly viable immune, epithelial, and stromal cell populations. Single cell RNA sequencing revealed that there is
a diversity of resident immune cells present at homeostasis in the mouse gallbladder/extrahepatic bile ducts,
including innate lymphoid cells, adaptive lymphocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells. In the
course of studying biliary tuft cellsârare, chemosensory epithelial cells with known immunomodulating
propertiesâI found that the biliary immune niche is altered in the absence of tuft cells, and is also sensitive to
the microbiome-status of the host. My data suggest that the microbiome and biliary epithelial cells (including tuft
cells) regulate the establishment of the biliary immune niche. In this proposal, I will test the role of the microbiome
and microbial metabolites in setting biliary immune âtone,â and will define a role for tuft cells in regulating the
biliary immune cell make-up. I will test whether alterations in the biliary immune niche at homeostasis, specifically
the presence or absence of neutrophils, can impact the progression of cholesterol gallstone disease. To
accomplish these aims, I have formed collaborations with experts in liver/biliary biology and microbiome
manipulations, and have established a career development plan that will facilitate increasing computational
independence. These studies will reveal new links between host factors and biliary inflammation, with the
potential for therapeutic targeting of biliary epithelial cells and the microbiome to impact biliary health and
disease."

Sepsis is a serious clinical condition with life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host
response to infection. Up to 70% of septic patients and more than 50% sepsis survivors develop
neurocognitive dysfunction, a debilitating condition termed sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). While
both clinical and experimental data suggest the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of SAE, the exact
causes and the molecular mechanisms leading to cerebral inflammation and neurocognitive dysfunction are
not well understood. We have recently shown that host cellular RNAs including microRNAs are released into
the blood circulation during sepsis and that circulating host RNA levels are closely associated with sepsis
severity in animals. Moreover, extracellular (ex) RNA of different species (human and rodents) and organs
(spleen and heart) and certain uridine-rich miRNAs can function as damage-associated molecular patterns
(DAMPs) and drive proinflammatory responses through a TLR7-dependent mechanism in peripheral immune
cells, in microglial cells, and in intact animals. Based on these information and other published literatures, we
hypothesize that innate immune activation driven by ex-miRNA-TLR7 signaling functions as a key mechanism
in cerebral inflammation and neurocognitive dysfunction following sepsis. To test the hypothesis, we propose
the following specific aims: Aim 1: To demonstrate the role of circulating ex-miRNAs in brain inflammation in
sepsis; Aim 2: To evaluate the role of plasma exosomes, as ex-miRNA carriers, in brain inflammation; Aim 3:
To test the contribution of ex-miRNAsÂ®TLR7 signaling to brain inflammation in sepsis; Aim 4: To demonstrate
that targeting ex-miRNAÂ®TLR7 signaling pathways improves the long-term neurocognitive function in sepsis
survivors. The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate the function and mechanisms of ex-miRNAÂ®TLR7
signaling in brain inflammation and neurocognitive dysfunction following sepsis. The anticipated results will
provide mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of sepsis-associated encephalopathy and potential novel
therapeutic targets."

A Non-Inferiority Randomized Single Blind Controlled Trial Comparing One and
 Two Dose Regimes of Oxfendazole versus a Two Dose Regime of
 Triclabendazole to Treat Chronic Fascioliasis
ABSTRACT
 Fasciola hepatica infection causes human liver disease in wide endemic regions around the world.
Triclabendazole is the only effective drug to treat human fascioliasis. However, it is not widely available
and recently reports about resistance in livestock and decreased efficacy in humans raise concerns
for the availability of effective treatment in human infections. Triclabendazole (TCBZ) resistance in
human has been reported in The Netherlands, Turkey, Chile, Portugal, and Peru. In our experience in
Cusco, Peru, more than 40% of children treated with one triclabendazole dose failed to achieve
parasitological cure and 60% of these failed a second dose of treatment.
 Oxfendazole (OXF) is a veterinary benzimidazole with a wide anti-helminthic spectrum. Our group
has demonstrated that OXF is highly efficacious against Taenia solium cysticercosis and other
helminths. A preliminary study in naturally infected sheep showed that OXF is also highly efficacious
against Fasciola hepatica. We have completed animal toxicology and phase 1 OXF studies in humans,
confirming the high bioavailability of OXF and, importantly, its safety. These data strongly suggest that
OXF is an excellent candidate for the treatment of human fascioliasis. Therefore, we propose to
compare two oral OXF treatment regimens, a single 20 mg/kg dose and two 20 mg/kg doses, against
the standard of care of two 10 mg/kg oral doses of TCBZ for the treatment of 336 children and adults
with chronic Fasciola hepatica infection in endemic areas of Cusco, Peru. In addition, population PK
modeling will be performed among subjects randomized to the OXF arms. This study will evaluate the
efficacy, safety, and population pharmacokinetics of OXF in the groups most affected by fascioliasis.
 This application builds upon our 25-years of experience working with OXF and takes advantage of
the solid expertise of the PIs in helminth infections, prior pivotal randomized clinical trials of anti-
parasitic treatment in cysticercosis, and our continued work in a well-known Fasciola-endemic region
in the Andes Mountains of Cusco. The investigators supported by the Oxfendazole Development
Group will form a multidisciplinary team of accomplished experts in fascioliasis, field epidemiology,
clinical trials, and new drug development that will ensure the successful completion of this study. This
trial has the potential to provide a new standard of care for the treatment of chronic fascioliasis. In
addition, it will be the first evaluation of OXF efficacy for a human tissue parasite and constitutes a
significant step forward towards making this promising drug available for the treatment of human. It will
provide additional pharmacokinetic and safety data to advance OXF development as a human drug."
10905992,"OVERALL â ABSTRACT
Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the accepted treatment in patients with end-stage liver failure and those
with tumors of hepatic origin. However, the organ shortage has prompted the use of extended criteria donors,
which are particularly susceptible to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). The overarching hypothesis of this P01
renewal is that IRI in OLT results from impaired regulation between donor liver-specific and host-derived innate
immunity. The project and core objectives, functioning in a highly synergistic manner, are to 1/ identify new target
molecules for improving donor liver quality (organ rejuvenation); 2/ provide novel therapeutic means against
acute IR-stress while promoting inflammation resolution (homeostatic reparation); and 3/ prevent sustained/
chronic inflammation to mitigate alloimmunity and improve outcomes (tolerance induction).
Project 1 focuses on a newly discovered CEACAM1 (CC1) negative checkpoint regulation of IR-triggered innate
immune activation/sterile inflammation in the mechanism of donor liver rejuvenation. Aim 1 and 2 will delineate
mechanisms by which enforced CC1 alternative splicing in the donor liver (S-isoform), or the recipient-derived
neutrophils (L-isoform) exert anti-inflammatory/cytoprotective functions in mouse IRI-OLT (synergy: Project 2/3).
Aim 3 will elucidate whether/how modulation of hepatic CC1 might improve the function of discarded human
livers (deemed untransplantable) when subjected to normothermic machine preservation (synergy: Project 3).
Project 2 defines mechanisms by which reprogramming of IR-stressed mouse liver-infiltrating macrophages and
resident heterogeneic KCs orchestrate the restoration of hepatic tissue homeostasis. In synergy with Project 1/3,
Aim 1 will determine the functional mechanisms by which embryonic vs. monocyte-derived KCs promote liver
IR-inflammation resolution. Aim 2 will define MerTK-mediated pro-resolution effector pathways in the liver-
resident KCs. Aim 3 will dissect the roles of KCs in OLT settings and whether/how liver inflammation resolution
and its kinetics impact the activation of alloimmunity and putative acquisition of transplant tolerance.
Project 3 dissects the innate immune DAMPs and associated cofactors/PRRs driving myeloid cell plasticity in
human IRI-OLT patients. In synergy with Project 1/2, Aim 1 will determine the TLR7/NOD2 and TLR9 ligands
and signaling pathways mediating differential polarization of regulatory vs. inflammatory macrophages and
crosstalk with T cells. Aim 2 will assess the therapeutic potential of PRR inhibition/preconditioning to mitigate
myeloid cell activation and OLT-IRI. Aim 3 will elucidate the impact of DAMP/PRR endotypes on the generation
of alloimmunity and graft outcome, and potential transplantation tolerance acquisition.
The Projects will be supported by an Administrative Core (Core A), Mouse/Human Liver Surgery Core (Core B),
and Computational/Biostatistics Core (Core C). This P01 unifies the well-proven collective expertise of a highly
experienced and interdisciplinary group of investigators, well-versed in the study of organ IRI, basic immunology,
liver immunobiology, and organ transplantation, both experimental and clinical."
10914079,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Overall)
This proposal is to continue to grow and expand the University of Louisville Superfund Center established in
2017. Currently, the Center supports research on the cardiometabolic effects of volatile organic chemicals
(VOCs) that are of high relevance to the Superfund Program. Center investigators conduct mode-of-action
research to unravel critical pathways of toxicity and to identify toxicological end-points (cardiometabolic changes)
of chemicals (VOCs) found at Superfund and related sites. Using high throughput mass spectrometry and an
innovative suite of mechanism-based biomarkers, animal experiments and human population studies, Center
investigations have contributed to the discovery and validation of novel biomarkers of both exposure and
cardiometabolic injury that would lay the foundation for future remediation strategies. These studies employ
state-of-the-art tools to develop pollutant atmospheres for animal exposure and to measure unique and sensitive
biological endpoints reflective of cardiometabolic injury. In addition, work supported by the Center is leading to
the development of new methods and devices for quantifying atmospheric levels of VOCs that employ advanced
technologies and offer precise, but low-cost measurements of hazardous waste sites. As before, the major
objectives of the Center are to conduct state-of-the-art research on the cardiometabolic toxicity of VOCs and to
determine how they affect cardiometabolic disease (CMD) prevalence and severity in exposed populations.
These studies will be complemented by mode-of-action mechanistic studies in animals to identify the molecular
and cellular mechanisms that contribute to VOC toxicity. The findings of these studies will continue to contribute
to both the discovery and the validation of sensitive and robust biomarkers that could be used to assess the
extent of exposure, metabolism and toxicity. Center investigators are creating new technologies for detecting
VOCs at low environmental levels to enable future exposure assessment activities. Senior Center members
educate and train junior investigators, graduate students and post-doctoral Fellows in the field of environmental
science, and promote relevant community awareness and participation to enhance mutual bidirectional
understanding of exposure risk and the health effects of exposure. The findings and discoveries of the Center
will be transferred to affected communities, end users in public and private sectors, and other stakeholders. For
future use and analysis, all samples of human and animal tissues and all data collected during Center
investigations will be stored in a computer-coded biorepository. Collectively, expansion and growth of the Center
activities will enhance its contribution and lead to rigorous evaluation and better understanding of the effects of
these hazardous chemicals on obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease."
10852805,"ABSTRACT More than 63% of US adults are employed, and work exerts an independent, powerful influence
on their health. At UNC Chapel Hill, our recognition of the role of work in health has driven our long history of
occupational safety and health promotion activities, including surveillance, basic etiology, intervention and
translation research, practice, and influence on public policy. As we conducted needs and strengths
assessments in preparation for this Center proposal, we saw how the COVID-19 pandemic created a massive
re-shaping of work, work conditions, and worker health â particularly related to mental health and well-being
among essential workers. This observation created tremendous interest among investigators at UNC Chapel
Hill, the NC Occupational Safety and Health Education Research Center, UNC's Center for Health Promotion
and Disease Prevention and Injury Prevention Research Center, collaborators at Duke University and UNC
Greensboro, and key stakeholders from public and private sectors to join forces to establish a new Carolina
Center for Total Worker Health and Well-Being. The mission of the Carolina Center is to generate new
knowledge and implement activities to improve worker health and well-being in North Carolina, the southeast
region, and the nation. Strong leadership, national experts on our External Advisory Committee (EAC) and at
RTI International will work with us to conduct the overall Center evaluation, with a goal of continuous quality
improvement that informs strategic planning efforts. Within the Center's Pilot Project Program, we will employ
data-driven approaches to prioritize proposals funded, be responsive to emerging issues, and support the work
of the four proposed research projects which address three essential worker groups (nurses/physicians,
firefighters and childcare) and an under-studied group of LGBTQ workers. Given the current and growing
needs we identified, we will focus our attention on mental health and well-being of these workers, as well as
traditional occupational safety outcomes such as slips, trips and falls. We will investigate different participatory
approaches to engaging with workers and other stakeholders as we move the research enterprise from basic
etiology and surveillance, to intervention and translation. Our Center's work directly addresses NORA and
TWH Research Agenda priorities with important, innovative research, as well as outreach and education
activities that will communicate the benefits of a TWH approach to businesses and key stakeholders, translate
our findings and disseminate them to improve policy and practice, and build capacity for TWH among new and
current occupational safety and health professionals through the expansion of our existing TWH certificate to
non-degree seeking health professionals. As evidenced by enthusiastic letters of support from existing
partners at UNC, our EAC members and others in Region 4, and several other TWH Center representatives,
the Carolina Center is uniquely positioned to address the challenges of improving worker and workplace health
in North Carolina, the southeastern region, and nationally."
10766670,"Osteoporosis and related metabolic bone diseases are nearly universal problems associated with advanced
age, particularly for postmenopausal women, expecting to cost society over $22 billion annually by 2020, and
leading to 65,000 deaths each year stemming from bone fragility fractures. Recent studies have demonstrated
that MRI may be of particular utility for addressing several factors related to bone quality that can only be
measured with difficulty in patients. High spatial resolution MRI can be used to accurately characterize
trabecular microarchitecture, and follow it with treatment, without the attendant ionizing radiation dose of DXA
or CT. Solid state MRI can uniquely measure the organic bone matrix content noninvasively as well as the
mineral. Proton (1H) solid state MRI has been used to measure bone matrix, while phosphorus (31P) solid state
MRI has potential to accurately assess 3D bone mineral density. Combining these two measurements in a
single simultaneous measurement could facilitate a more informative diagnostic for metabolic bone disease,
especially if coupled with high spatial resolution 3D trabecular imaging.
 MRI is an expensive measurement, and not justified for screening for or diagnosing metabolic bone
disease. However, if the cost of MRI could be drastically reduced, such measurements could become
financially competitive with DXA while providing significantly increased diagnostic information content, and at
the same time completely eliminating ionizing radiation exposure.
 In this project, we will develop the methodology of MRI characterization of metabolic bone disease using a
unique dedicated inexpensive, compact, cryogen-free extremity MRI scanner designed and constructed in a
previous NIH-funded project. Notably, the magnet of this scanner has been designed for comfortable and
efficacious extremity scanning, and in particular contains three bores: a central bore that is the âactiveâ bore in
which the limb being scanned is inserted, and two peripheral ânonactiveâ bores that comfortably accept the leg
not being scanned. Both the capital and operating costs of this scanner, as well as the clinic âreal estateâ it
occupies, are drastically lower than for the typical whole body scanner. As of this writing, a second generation
compact tiltable magnet with multiple openings may arrive in the PI's lab by the beginning of this project.
 The specific aims are: 1) Further the technical development of high spatial resolution 3D MRI of trabecular
network architecture, and solid state proton and phosphorus MRI for quantitative bone mineral and matrix
measurement; 2) Assess the quantitative accuracy of solid state MRI for these measurements in phantoms,
animal tissues, and live animals; 3) Evaluate the repeatability and accuracy of high spatial resolution and solid
state MRI scanning in healthy volunteer subjects; and 4) Carry out studies of metabolic bone disease patients
and age- and gender-matched normals to make a preliminary assessment of the accuracy of MRI-based bone
characterization, and to acquire statistical information that will permit the design of future clinical trials."
10868663,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT â OVERALL
N-Nitrosamines are a family of hazardous chemicals that are among the most mutagenic chemicals known, and
many are potently carcinogenic in animal models. People living in Wilmington, MA, are concerned about N-
nitrosamines because there are over 20 million gallons of N-nitrosamine-contaminated waste at the nearby Olin
Chemical Superfund Site, contaminating the environment and rendering their well water undrinkable. The
Passamaquoddy Tribe is also concerned about N-nitrosamines, because their water contains high levels of
organic material and the use of chloramine is known to create N-nitrosodimethylamine. Specific Aim 1 is to
make and measure. Innovative, light-based chemical sensors that exploit smartphones will be created and used
for Citizen Science to gain information that will help to inform cleanup by the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA). Innovative, high-throughput `animate sensors,' based on cell-microarray technology, will be created and
used to test the consequences of N-nitrosamines on health-related impacts known to be associated with cancer
risk. To understand disease more deeply, a genetically engineered âcanary in the coal mineâ mouse model will
be used to reveal the potential for long-term low-dose exposure to cause mutations and deleterious biological
responses. Specific Aim 2 is to protect human health via prediction and prevention of disease. By
integrating multi-omics data (fueled by the Data Management and Analysis Core [DMAC]), mechanistic
knowledge will propel the development of predictive biomarkers that can be used to develop methods to prevent
disease. The potential for probiotics to suppress N-nitrosamine-induced cancer will be studied. In addition, novel
devices will be created to destroy N-nitrosamines via electrochemical and biochemical destruction. Importantly,
risk evaluation depends on knowledge from both engineers and biologists. The DMAC will thus form a critical
integrating role by merging transdisciplinary data streams to evaluate risk for specific water samples. Specific
Aim 3 is to maximize societal impact via integration within the MIT SRP and with partners outside of MIT.
Partnering with the community will allow collection of environmental data that will inform risk. Via bidirectional
communication, community members will also benefit from novel, hands-on teaching kits, while MIT SRP
members will benefit from learning about community perspectives and concerns. Dissemination of MIT SRP
knowledge and technologies will also be achieved via continued strengthening of relationships between the MIT
SRP and local, state, Tribal and governmental agents, including community members who are most impacted
by N-nitrosamine contamination. All of this work will be made possible by careful coordination and formalization
of translation opportunities (made possible by the Administrative Core), and by continuous improvement of
training opportunities that not only fuel the research (made possible by the Research Experience and Training
Coordination Core [RETCC]), but also help to ensure that trainees go on to contribute as responsible leaders
who are able to leverage cross-disciplinary research in order to have a powerful impact on public health."
10765668,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) affects almost 2.5% of all US Veterans, and it
contributes to nearly 1 in 14 deaths in Veterans. Unlike other forms of heart failure, there are currently no
treatment options for HFpEF that reduce mortality. A common cause of morbidity and mortality in HFpEF is
right ventricular (RV) failure, and there are currently no therapies directly targeting RV failure in heart failure.
Regardless of the cause, studies have shown that the failing RV undergoes a metabolic shift characterized by
decreased utilization of fatty acid oxidation for energy generation and increased mitochondrial dysfunction.
While restoring fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial function are thought to be beneficial, there are currently
no therapies that can successfully do so in the failing RV. The goal of the proposal is to support the career
development of Dr. Vineet Agrawal by providing him the training, mentorship, and resources to pursue a career
in identifying mechanisms by which obesity and metabolic dysfunction fundamentally alter RV metabolism to
promote failure, and secondarily identify viable therapies to improve outcomes in a patient population that
currently has none. This work is supported by primary mentors, Drs. Julie Bastarache and Anna Hemnes, and
a complementary research advisory committee. Dr. Agrawal will leverage their combined mentorship to study
the role of a novel therapeutic target, natriuretic peptide clearance receptor NPRC, in the treatment of obesity-
induced HFpEF. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that increased NPRC expression in the HFpEF RV
results in RV failure through impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. This central hypothesis
will be tested in two specific aims that will test the following hypotheses: (1) that knockdown of NPRC in a
model of obesity-induced HFpEF prevents and reverses RV failure by restoring fatty acid oxidation and
mitochondrial biogenesis, and (2) NPRC directly inhibits mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation in
vitro through cAMP and cGMP-mediated regulation of PGC1a. This proposal will utilize a novel transgenic
mouse in which NPRC can inducibly be knocked out to study the role of NPRC in vivo, and CRISPR edited
human induced pluripotent stem cells and H9C2 cardiomyocyte-like cells to study the role of NPRC in
modulating cardiomyocyte function in vitro. Through the studies proposed to test the hypotheses above, Dr.
Agrawal will also accomplish the following career development and training objectives to: (1) master
techniques to study mitochondrial function and metabolism of tissue and cells, (2) master techniques to
generate and differentiate human induced pluripotent stem cells and cardiomyocytes (hiPSCs), (3) master
techniques in gene editing in vitro, and (4) refine professional development and communication skills to
achieve goals of academic progress, effective communication, and successful VA Merit submission."
10758185,"Project Summary:
Doxorubicin (DOX) is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic agents used for cancer treatment, but it also
causes systemic inflammation and serious multi-organ side effects and muscle dysfunction in many patients.
The loss of muscle strength in combination with constant fatigue is a burden on cancer patients undergoing
chemotherapy. However, it is unknown whether inflammation induced cell death, known as pyroptosis (a
distinct form of cell death, compared to apoptosis, and necrosis) occurs in DOX induced muscle toxicity and
dysfunction (DIMT). Our preliminary data shows that treatment with DOX induces pyroptosis in Soleus
muscle (SM), Sol 8 cells which is inhibited by exosomes derived from embryonic stem cells (ES-exos). We
also observed increase in pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), formation of NLRP3
inflammasome and pyroptotic specific caspase 1, IL-1Î², and IL-18 post-DIMT in SM following DOX treatment.
Mice treated with ES-Exos post-DMIT decreased M1 macrophages, TLR4, NLRP3 inflammasome and SM
pyroptosis. Moreover, phenoswitching of M1 macrophages occurred which significantly increased anti-
inflammatory M2 macrophages and reduced pyroptosis as well as adverse SM remodeling. miRNA array data
shows increase in miR200c in ES-Exos. Furthermore, our preliminary data shows significantly decrease in
phosphorylated p38 and JNK in DIMT following ES-Exos treatment, suggesting involvement of p38/JNK
pathway. Therefore, based on this compelling data, we hypothesize that ES-Exos ameliorate DOX-induced
pyroptosis and associated adverse muscle remodeling by increasing anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages
thereby improving muscle function post-DIMT. We propose to test this hypothesis through the following 3
specific aims. Aim 1: To determine if increased level of M1 macrophages induce TLR4 and activates
inflammasome (NLRP3) mediated pyroptosis during short and long-term post-DIMT. Aim 2 To demonstrate
whether treatment with ES-Exos cause phenoswitching of M1 into M2 macrophages results in amelioration of
pyroptosis and adverse SM remodeling. We will also determine the mechanisms of miR200c mediated p38 and
JNK cell signaling in pyroptosis following ES-Exos treatment in DIMT. Additionally, we will examine the
presence of broader range of miRNA specific for cell signaling, anti-pyroptotic, and anti-fibrotic pathways
following ES-Exos treatment. Aim 3: To determine whether ES-Exos exert effects on anti-tumor efficacy of
DOX in cancer while improving SM function. The proposed studies are hypothesis-driven, mechanistic, and
should help define the impact of ES-Exos on M2 macrophage phenoswitching, pro- and anti-inflammatory
cytokines, pyroptosis and apoptosis in the progression of DIMT. Also, we expect that ES-Exos would have no
interference with the DOX-induced killing of cancer cells and inhibition of tumor growth. We believe that
results obtained from these studies can easily be translated to the clinic as the cell free preparation of
exosomes will not form teratomas, which is common occurrence with the use of human and mouse ES cells."

The goal of our Total Worker Health Center of Excellence, the California Labor Laboratory (CALL) is to
understand the causes of and prevent or mitigate the health impacts of emergent working conditions. The axes
of change in work include the growth of alternative work arrangements and contingent forms of employment, and
erosion of traditional working conditions. CALL will emphasize the health impacts on those most vulnerable to
the changes, including racial and ethnic minorities; women; immigrants; low wage workers; persons with
disabilities; and younger and older workers, especially those with chronic diseases. Covid-19 has made it clear
just how vulnerable these groups are to the changes. Concern for their welfare motivates the proposed Center.
California not only has the largest population of any state, at just under 40 million, but it is among the most
diverse in its racial and ethnic composition. California has also been a trend-setter in work organization, with
large proportion of the workforce not being directly hired by the firm for which the work is done.
CALL has these specific aims: 1) To describe, through RESEARCH, the prevalence of alternative work
arrangements, document the etiological connection between those work arrangements, important sentinel
working conditions, and adverse health outcomes, and perform research to uncover the mechanisms that
translate work arrangements into poor health; and 2) To mitigate the health impacts of alternative work
arrangements through a robust OUTREACH program encompassing the development of an interdisciplinary
training program for healthy work based on research from CALL, consulting to workers and employers on best
practices, and working with policymakers in regulatory, executive, and legislative branches of government at the
State and Federal level to develop legislation to improve the health of work through the POLICY FORUM.
CALL is a joint endeavor of two of the premier research universities in the nation, the University of California at
Berkeley (UCB) and San Francisco (UCSF), but includes participants from Harvard, UCLA, and the State
Department of Public Health. Several projects will jointly sponsor and use a longitudinal survey of 5,000 working
age Californians to study the effect of emergent work organization and workplace exposures on health and to
develop and test a multidimensional tool to evaluate the health of employment. Additional projects will use a
customized sample of service workers to study the impact of inequality in working conditions and the Stateâs
public health surveillance powers to gauge the impact of employment in the stone fabrication industry on the
health of its largely immigrant workforce. CALLâs EVALUATION and PLANNING CORE develops strategic
direction for the Center, manages its operations, and evaluates its progress. The activities of the Center are
guided by a distinguished EXTERNAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE. The COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT BOARD
will bring the perspectives of the Stateâs diverse population into the design and implementation of the Centerâs
research and outreach activities to reduce impacts on vulnerable populations."

The UC Berkeley Superfund Research Center, in consultation with the Centerâs key stakeholders and advisory

to: 1) better assess risks to pregnant women, the fetus and young children; 2) protect disadvantaged
communities; 3) understand the totality of chemicals communities are exposed to; 4) account for interactions
between mixtures of chemicals; 5) perform on site in situ remediation without depleting valuable resources or
transporting contaminated soil to other locations; and, 6) destroy persistent chemicals that are resistant to
remediation. Four interactive projects (2 biomedical and 2 engineering) and 4 required cores are proposed to
address these six problems though original research. Our proposed research and community engagement efforts
aim to provide information and tools that will help solve these complex problems associated with Superfund
contaminants and address the four mandates of the Superfund Research Program (SRP).
 The proposed interdisciplinary projects and cores of the UC Berkeley Center are all designed to address
one or more of the four mandates as applied to chemicals high on ATSDRâs Superfund priority list, of importance
to the US EPAâs Programs, and of concern to other stakeholders, including arsenic, chromium and other metals,
PFAS and other halogenated contaminants. Our overall goal is to improve the remediation and understanding
of the health effects of mixtures of Superfund contaminants. To achieve this, we propose to take a systems
approach, a problem-solving paradigm grounded in public health concepts. Together with our Stakeholders, we
will collectively form an understanding of some of the issues they face and create a bidirectional dialogue
between us. We will attempt to perform basic research that informs action, learning and refining as we go. This
âsystemsâ approach is central to improving public health. It is an approach that has been widely used in many
public health settings and will be used as the central paradigm within our Center.
 Biomedical Projects 1 and 2 with the DMAC will study the effects of mixtures of contaminants on perinatal
outcomes and the developing immune system. Engineering Projects 3 and 4 will develop a complementary
treatment approach consisting of in situ chemical treatment in combination with biological radical systems to
remediate a broad range of PFAS and other highly persistent halogenated pollutants. With Core A they will also
assess the fate of the transformation products generated by the treatment process and their potential for toxicity.
Core B in collaboration with Projects 1, 4 and the DMAC will address drinking water quality problems in California
that exist despite sophisticated statewide water infrastructure and federal water quality laws. Core C (DMAC)
will manage, store and share data from all projects and cores using FAIR guidelines and assist in the biostatistical
analysis of all project-generated data. Core D will provide all trainees with trans-disciplinary education, and
training in environmental health, toxicology and environmental engineering."

10802399,"Project Summary/Abstract
Pain is among the most pervasive and universal forms of human distress. Pain typically is measured by patient
self-report or clinician impressions, either through clinical interview or the visual analog scale. However, self-
reported pain is difficult to interpret and in some circumstances not possible to obtain [Hadjistavropoulos et
al., 2002]. To improve the standard of care and advance pain assessment, monitoring, and intervention, we
propose (1) a savvy technology based on automatic facial, head, and body movement analysis for a reliable and
valid assessment of the occurrence and intensity associated with five causes of acute and chronic low back pain
(LBP); (2) inform our understanding of psychosocial and behavioral indicators of chronic LBP to develop new
means to prevent chronic LBP.
Participants' face, head, and body movement will be recorded during clinical assessment using two
synchronized high-definition digital video cameras during extension, flexion, and rotation movements. The
obtained video-recordings, taken during a first visit to the clinic and 3 follow-up visits after treatment, will be
used for the development of automatic measures of the occurrence and intensity of pain. To investigate the
generalizability of the proposed automatic measures, we will explicitly train and test the proposed classifiers on
five different types of acute and chronic LBP. To do so, face, head, and body movement will be automatically
tracked using our fully- automatic methods. The tracking results will be used to train end-to-end deep-leaning
based classifiers to automatically measure the occurrence and intensity of LBP. To investigate the validity of
the proposed classifiers, we will compare automated measurement to the patient- and clinician- rated visual
analog scale, brief pain inventory, and continuous observer ratings of pain intensity from the video recordings.
MANOVA will be used to quantify the relationship between the individual modalities and their combination for
the measurement of the occurrence and intensity of the five LBP conditions and for chronic and acute
conditions.
To inform our understanding of how LBP evolves into a chronic form, we will use Ecological Momentary
Assessment (EMA) to collect behavioral and contextual information beyond the video-recordings and pain
scores' assessments. Participants will be monitored for 6 months after treatment, at a frequency of 7
consecutive days per month (1 week per month), and 4 prompts per day, to identify those who evolved to
chronic LBP. EMA measures will be used to investigate whether pain intensity differs by psychosocial and
behavioral factors both between and within LBP groups as well as whether psychosocial and behavioral factors
are associated with the development of chronic LBP."

asked what he wanted to get from participating in our study. His five simple words brought a tectonic shift in
my thinking and provided the deep purpose to my work. Patientâs do not need fancy technology. They need
to feel whole. They need to be connected. As a neural engineer, I develop neural interface technology that
connects to humans. Three additional words are needed to capture my passion and over-arching goal as a
VA Research Career Scientist: I develop nerve interface technology that connects to humans to connect humans.
 For nearly thirty years, I have combined a love for electrical engineering (B.S.E.E., 1992, Michigan
Technological Univ, Houghton, MI) and computation algorithms with fascination of the brain and
neuroscience to develop technology for communicating directly with the human nervous system (Ph.D.
Biomedical Engineering, 1999, Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH). I am one of the worldâs top experts
in development and translation of systems to precisely apply small electrical current injections to nerves to
cause targeted action potentials in nerves. Early in my career, I used this technology to restore lost function
following stroke or paralysis by activating muscles. I still actively collaborate with other VA investigators
(Drs. Ronald Triolo, Gilles Pinault, Bolu Ajiboye, Emily Graczyk, and Robert Kirsch) in a supporting role to
implement neural interface technology in clinical rehabilitation programs for spinal cord injury. A decade
ago, however, I became much more interested in the power of the technology to communicate to the brain
through sensory and autonomic systems. My VA activity fits into three area: 1) sensory technology for
veterans with limb loss; 2) hypertension control in veterans that have not been responsive to medications,
and 3) development of advances in peripheral nerve interface technology. Sensory Technology restores
both functional and emotional connection following limb loss of the upper extremity (with Drs. J. Robert
Anderson, Kevin Malone, Kyle Chepla, and Emily Graczyk) and lower extremity (with Drs. Ronald Triolo,
Gilles Pinault, and Hamid Chakhkar). My lab in the Cleveland VA Medical Center is the first in the world
to have a long-term implant of a peripheral interfaces for sensory restoration following limb loss. Eight
subjects, four with upper extremity and four with lower extremity limb loss, have been implanted. Over the
past four years, I have led a program funded by both the VA and the Defense Advance Research Projects
Agency to develop a fully implantable, BluetoothÂ®-connected system for bi-directional connection between
and external prosthesis and implanted interfaces. My team has secured all necessary regulatory approvals
to start the worldâs first randomized clinical trial (RCT) of neural-connected advanced prostheses. Over the
next four years, this study will complete a critical step in moving the technology to general availability for
all veterans with limb loss. Hyptertension: Neural interface technology is applied to modulate function of
complex regulation of blood pressure. In individuals that are unresponsive to pharmaceutical approaches,
we control hypertension through the baroreflex via activation of the carotid sinus nerve (CSN or Herringâs
nerve) (with Drs. Jonathan Baskin, Gilles Pinault, and Elizabeth Heald). The work is in collaboration with a
commercial partner to rapidly advance the technology benefit veterans within the next five years. Advancing
Interfaces: To continue advancing the clinical capabilities of neural interfaces, advances in technology are
continually needed. I continue pre-clinical development and translation of next generation of peripheral nerve
technology. This includes increasing the number of channels on each electrode and the distribution of the
contact throughout the nerve. This includes collaboration with MEMS fabrication specialist in the Cleveland
VA (Dr. Douglas Shire) and Lawrence Livermore National Lab (Dr. Razi Haque) to develop high-density
FINE and interfascicular nerve electrodes, implantation techniques, and high-density inline connectors."

Over 40,000 U.S. women will die of breast cancer each year. Screening mammography saves lives but also
results in potential harms. Personalized screening regimens tailored to a woman's individual risk can both
improve early detection of lethal cancers through more intensive regimens for high-risk women, and reduce
over-screening and over-treatment of low-risk women. However, the current clinical breast cancer risk
prediction models are insufficiently accurate for discriminating high-risk and low-risk women. New radiomic
deep learning algorithms, which automatically mine troves of breast tissue features from a woman's screening
mammogram to predict her future cancer risk, have enormous potential to transform breast cancer screening,
but have not been independently validated. New polygenic risk scores (PRS) for breast cancer also show
promise for improving risk prediction, although still costly to implement on a population scale. We propose to
examine whether adding radiomic and genomic risk scores can significantly improve current clinical risk
prediction models in a large, diverse population-based cohort of 178K women enrolled in Kaiser Permanente's
Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health (RPGEH) who were screened with 2D full-field digital
mammography (FFDM). We also propose to extend the best performing radiomic deep learning algorithms to
diverse screening mammography systems utilized in two large health care settings in California and New York,
including a cohort of 50K women screened with 3D digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in the Mount Sinai
Health System (MSHS). The specific aims are to: (1) Evaluate the performance of radiomic deep learning
breast cancer risk prediction models, estimate their associations with 5-year and 10-year breast cancer risk,
and determine the extent to which the associations are independent of known clinical risk factors; (2)
Determine whether radiomic and genomic risk scores independently predict breast cancer risk, and explore
potential differences by race/ethnicity and other clinical risk factors; and (3) Transfer the best radiomic deep
learning algorithm(s) from 2D FFDM to 3D tomosynthesis. The proposed research will fill essential knowledge
gaps needed to realize the potential of radiomics and genomics by validating new radiomic algorithms,
quantifying the improvements in model performance above traditional risk factor models and new polygenic
risk scores, exploring differences by race/ethnicity, and extending the best radiomic tools to diverse
mammography systems utilized in two large multi-ethnic health care settings.

10907440,"Project Summary/Abstract
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a devastating disease with a poor outcome. When a patient is
first diagnosed with NSCLC, the person would typically undergo diagnostic bronchoscopy and/or
therapeutic surgery. These two procedures have technical challenges that limit their success such as
inaccurate biopsies, failure to locate nodules and lymph nodes, missed occult tumors, and positive
margins. As a consequence, there is a 40% failure rate for these procedures. This Project will use
optical imaging in the near-infrared (NIR) range to generate practical solutions to these problems and
make these two common procedures safer, more efficient, and have improved outcomes. The goal of
this Project is to test the hypothesis that intraoperative imaging in the NIR spectrum with targeted
molecular tracers can identify tumor cells in order to improve procedures that are utilized for the
management of patients with NSCLC. The innovation of this Program Project will be in the matrix of
cocktail dye development, new NIR camera devices, and clinical translation. There are three specific
goals of this Project. First, to develop a set of targeted near-infrared molecular imaging contrast agents
that are sensitive and specific to a range of distinct targets on NSCLC. Second, to develop and integrate
highly NIR spectral sensitive imaging platforms into commonly used white light imaging devices so they
can be utilized during clinical procedures. And third, to apply these innovations to solve common clinical
problems in order to impact patient care. If successful, the molecular optical imaging solution presented
in this proposal would be immediately applicable to several hundred thousand lung cancer patients
each year."

10760331,"Project Summary
 Apathy is one of the earliest and most clinically distressing neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in Alzheimerâs
disease (AD), whose neurobiology across the AD clinical spectrum is poorly understood. Although apathy can
be reliably measured by several validated scales and has been associated with clinical progression of AD, there
are currently few effective interventions for apathy or biomarkers of treatment response. Recently, the âmild
behavioral impairment (MBI)â construct has been proposed to capture emergent, prominent NPS that may be
among the earliest presentation of underlying AD pathology in non-demented older adults, preceding or
coincident with cognitive impairment. MBI consists of 5 domains including a âdecreased motivation, interest, and
driveâ domain, capturing the reward circuitry and positive valence disturbance of apathy.
 Despite the clinical relevance of apathy, a major research question is whether the disturbances in brain
circuits underlying apathy are shared with or different than those underlying cognitive and functional impairment
in AD, and whether these mechanisms vary through the behavioral and cognitive spectrum of AD. In the current
project, we will visualize the in vivo regional distribution of tau and amyloid and structural and functional brain
circuits (network connectivity and white matter abnormalities) to determine whether altered baseline brain circuits
and concurrent AD pathology predict baseline severity and future worsening of apathy across individuals with
the âfull dimensionality of neurobehavioral functioningâ (RFA-MH-19-510): 1) Cognitively normal (CN) older
adults, 2) amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 3) MBI-decreased motivation domain, and 4) mild AD
dementia. Attaining a better understanding of these neural mechanisms across early-stage AD is crucial for
developing new treatment strategies and biomarkers for clinical trials.
 Our preliminary work investigating brain-behavior relations of apathy in AD has revealed evidence of early
inferior temporal and parietal involvement and later frontal-subcortical circuit alterations. Our experience with
flortaucipir positron emission tomography suggests that in preclinical AD, tau has an inferior temporal predilection
where it is also associated with depressive symptoms, while in MCI and AD dementia, there is wider spread,
including to frontal regions that are associated with apathy. We therefore hypothesize that as AD pathology
spreads and fronto-parietal circuits are disrupted, apathy will emerge and worsen.
 We will assess the relationships among baseline measures of functional and structural brain circuits using
Connectome sequences, concomitant in vivo regional tau and amyloid pathology, and baseline and longitudinal
apathy over 3 years in 200 participants (50 CN, 50 MCI, 50 MBI-decreased motivation, and 50 mild AD
dementia). We will leverage funded R01 AG053184 (PI: Marshall) to cover imaging costs for CN and MCI
participants, while the current study will cover imaging costs for MBI-decreased motivation and AD dementia
participants, and apathy clinical assessment costs for all participants."
10874494,"Comprehensive tools and models for addressing exposure to mixtures during environmental
emergency-related contamination events
Overall Program Description
Climate change-associated disasters coupled with economic activity and the enhanced vulnerability of already
disadvantaged communities markedly increase risks from catastrophic chemical contamination events resulting
from weather-related or anthropogenic emergencies. The complexities of chemical exposures and their potential
adverse health impacts, the need to rapidly and comprehensively evaluate the potential hazards of exposures
to complex mixtures, and the necessity of protecting vulnerable populations and life-stages call for novel
approaches in the Superfund Research Program. This Center consists of a team of well-established scientists
from biomedical, geosciences, data science, and engineering disciplines who share a common goal: to develop,
apply, and translate a comprehensive set of tools and models that will aid first responders, impacted
communities, and government agencies in characterizing and mitigating the human health consequences of
exposure to hazardous mixtures. These will be applicable for both existing contaminated waste sites and
disaster-related contamination events. Project 1 will develop novel analytical and computational strategies for
exposure assessment of complex mixtures. Project 2 will develop novel tools to rapidly characterize pediatric
respiratory health risks from exposure to hazardous volatile organic compounds after environmental disasters.
Project 3 will develop and use feto-maternal interface tissue chip models for rapid assessment of preterm birth
risks of hazardous substances. Project 4 will continue development of predictive in vitro methods for quantitative
evaluation of the complex mixtures and intra- and inter-individual variability in toxicity. Project 5 is responsive to
the Superfund remediation mandate by using experimental and computational engineering to develop optimized
multi-component sorbents for toxic mixtures. A Disaster Research Response (DR2) Core will be a centralized
resource for environmental sampling and assessment before, during, and after disasters. A Data Management
and Analysis Core will develop computational and statistical tools for analysis and integration of âbig dataâ in
environmental health. A Risk and Geospatial Science Core will provide the Center with data and services for
characterizing human health risks and the geographic distribution of hazardous substances during disasters.
The Center will engage with community organizations and public health practitioners in Texas to address health
concerns of the populations that may be impacted by environmental emergency-related contamination events.
We will continue training students and postdoctoral fellows in inter-disciplinary approaches across our scientific
areas, decision making and emergency response. The research translation to local, state, national and
international stakeholders involves both technology transfer and regular outreach. Finally, the management of
this program includes close partnerships with the Texas A&M University administration and the NIEHS-funded
Center for Translational Environmental Health Research, and is overseen by the advisors representing
academia, federal and state agencies, industry and a non-governmental organization."
10877983,"OVERALL CENTER SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Support is requested to continue human health-oriented research on risks from exposure to chemicals
commonly found in Superfund sites and on remediation technologies to minimize exposure to chemicals from
those sites. The pollutants under investigation belong to the halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon family that
bind and activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). These chemicals, which include polychlorinated
dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans, biphenyls and polyaromatic hydrocarbons, are environmentally persistent,
lipid soluble contaminants that bioaccumulate in the food chain leading to human and wildlife exposure. A
highly integrated, multidisciplinary research program is proposed consisting of five research projects and five
supporting cores. The research team includes 25 investigators from Michigan State University (20), Emory
University (1), Purdue University (1), Rutgers University (2) and the Michigan Department of Health and
Human Services (1). The central overarching theme of the proposed program is to define specific
aspects of environmental, microbial and mammalian biomolecular responses to environmental
contaminants that act as agonists for the AhR. The major research thrusts will provide new mechanistic
information regarding: (1) the diversity and physiogenomic responses of (chloro)dioxin degrading microbial
populations indigenous to soils, sediments and groundwater; (2) the geochemical parameters governing
adsorbtion, bioavailability and long-term fate of AhR ligands through interactions with geosorbent compositions
in soils and sediment components; and (3) the mechanisms of action and computational modeling of
interactions between specific biochemical pathways and ligand-activated AhR associated with the liver, thyroid
and immune system responses. The Computational Modeling Core (CMC) will develop dynamic computational
models of biological responses induced by AhR ligands. An Administrative Core will support research, training,
community engagement, data management, and information and technology transfer in this Superfund
Research Center (SRC). Within the Administrative Core, research translation will disseminate research
findings to target audiences in government, industry and academia. A Community Engagement Core (CEC)
will communicate with community stakeholders through engagement with county and city health officials in
three new Michigan communities that continue to experience dioxin exposure. A Data Management and
Analysis Core will provide the technology, expertise, infrastructure and training necessary to curate datasets,
metadata, processing and analyses needed to properly manage and share high quality reproducible data.
Lastly, a Research Experience and Training Coordination Core (RETCC) will ensure cross-disciplinary training
to pre- and postdoctoral trainees."

Title: Early in vivo expressed antigens and their role in virulence, immune response, and vaccines for
coccidioidomycosis.
SUMMARY
Coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley Fever (VF), is an important fungal disease caused by two different
Coccidioides species that results in regionally important mortality and even greater morbidity. We have
assembled a team to define the changes that occur in human and animal immune responses to VF, and to use
this knowledge for designing new vaccines and diagnostic tests. This work will capitalize upon our detailed
observations of Coccidioides gene expression patterns during the earliest stages of infections. We hypothesize
that some Coccidioides early genes are virulence factors and critical for causing disease. Research Project 1
will test their role through gene knockouts using CRISPR-Cas9 technology and virulence testing in wax worm
(Galleria) and mouse VF models. Critical virulence factors will become diagnostic and vaccine targets. In addition
to the wax worm and mouse models, we develop a non-human primate (pig-tailed macaques) that will more
closely resemble VF in humans. In humans and vertebrate animal models, the role of T cells cannot be
overemphasized and Research Project 2 will use focused deep DNA sequencing to identify classes of T cell
receptors (TCR) that develop in response to early expressed Coccidioides genes. We will generate TCR
sequences from patients at three clinical locations that span the endemic zones for the pathogen. The TCR
repertoire from patients will be used to identify novel diagnostic signatures (e.g., public TCRs) and, also, help
identify immune responses to key antigens that can be targeted for vaccine development. Hence, both TCR and
early virulence genes represent excellent candidates for vaccine design that will be explored in Research
Project 3 using nucleic acid (NA) based vaccines (RNA and DNA) that can rapidly test a large panel of antigens
through the immunization of mice against infection. The DNA vaccine will be based upon delivery on gold
nanoparticles and Gene Gun, while the mRNA employs self-replicating RNA molecules (repRNA) and a Lipid
InOrganic Nanoparticle (LION). Both are proven technologies that are moving forward into clinical trials for other
diseases. Our goal in the NA vaccine mouse studies is to identify the best antigens and delivery modality for
vaccine testing in the NHP model and to define their immune mechanisms of protection. This work is only
possible through the integrated efforts of investigators at seven different institutions, including three clinical sites,
as no single institution has the requisite breadth of expertise and infrastructure. While we will generate
fundamental knowledge about Coccidioides and VF, we will also make translational advances towards
preventing and diagnosing the disease."

10813690,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This project builds on recent research in our laboratory that showed for the first time that genes directly shape
the way a child sees the world: what a child spends time looking atâas well as how, when, and where she
looksâare all strongly influenced by genetic variation (Constantino et al, Nature, 2017). Identical twins, who
share the same genetic variation, effectively synchronize their looking to social content. Moreover, these same
measures of social looking are markedly and differentially decreased in children with autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) (Î§2= 64.03, P < 0.0001). In the current project, we will measure genetic and environmental influence on
social visual engagement and brain growth from birth through toddlerhood, quantifying effects of gene-
environment transactions over time. We will use eye-tracking to measure how infants look at the social world
and MRI to measure changing brain connectivity under conditions of controlled genetic variation: identical &
fraternal twins followed from the first week after birth. We will enroll 240 twins (120 pairs), collecting eye-
tracking data at 10 time points, neuroimaging data at 5 time points, and standardized assessments of social-
communicative competency at 3 time points. This application will test the hypothesis that gene-by-
environment-by-age transactions in the first years of life serve as a powerful developmental canalizing
mechanism, a mechanism capable of providing the necessary shared medium for typical social development,
and yet equally capable of channeling diverse initial liabilities off-course, into atypical social development
resulting in the syndromic social disability called autism spectrum disorder. By quantifying the developmental
timing of gene-environment transactions, together with their impact on phenotypic presentation of social
behavior and brain growth, this project will provide insights into modifiable behavioral pathways that offer the
greatest therapeutic potential to prevent or preempt the emergence of deleterious consequences of atypical
development as found in ASD and other neurodevelopmental disabilities."
10553226,"Each year, over 1.9 million children sustain a concussion, with adolescents accounting for over 50% of these
mild traumatic brain injuries. A concussion can affect cognition, concentration, processing speed, and
oculomotor function. Driving requires integration of these functions, including assessment of the visual scene,
processing of environmental risks, and execution of complex skills in rapid succession. Adolescents are at
greatest risk for a motor vehicle crash (MVC), and the neurofunctional decrements due to concussion impairs
abilities integral to safe driving. However, there are no evidence-based guidelines for return to drive
recommendations for adolescents, and little research has specifically examined returning to drive after a
concussion in adolescents. The long-term goal of this R01 is to establish the evidence base for return to drive
recommendations for adolescents after a concussion. The objective is to examine the neurophysiological
functioning of the recovering concussed adolescent brain while managing driving tasks, the association
between their neurophysiological functioning and clinical assessments, and the nature of concussed
adolescents' engagement in risky driving behaviors. The innovation of this R01 includes 1) Discovery, 2)
Translation and 3) Real-world Assessment. In the synergy of the three Aims, this R01 will employ driving
simulation, fNIRS, and pupillometry as measures of neurophysiological function; examine the association of
these objective measures with clinical assessments; and prospectively quantify driving behaviors of concussed
adolescents with objective on-road in-vehicle monitoring and ecological momentary monitoring (EMA) of
concussion symptoms. Taken together these aims form the foundational science necessary for evidence-
based recommendations for return to drive after concussion. In a driving simulated study for Aim 1 (Discovery),
cognitive workload measured with functional near-infrared spectroscopy and autonomic function measured
with pupillometry will be compared for concussed and non-concussed adolescents. In Aim 2 (Translation), we
will evaluate the relationship between the objective measures of neurophysiology collected the simulated
driving study with standard concussion assessments used in the clinical setting. In Aim 3 (Real-world
Assessment), data on real-time, on-road, driving behaviors will objectively measure risky driving behaviors of
concussed and non-concussed adolescents, while integrating EMA assessment of concussion symptoms.
Each aim helps delineate important facets of returning to drive after concussion for adolescents, including what
is happening in the concussed adolescent brain, how it relates to clinical assessments, and how concussed
adolescents engage in driving behaviors that place them at most risk for an MVC. Across the three aims, this
innovative approach will provide the scientific foundation to establish evidence-based clinical guidelines that
can promote health and wellness as adolescents return to drive after concussion."

Well-trained minority health investigators from health disparity (HD) populations are in a position to make a
unique impact on the science of eliminating HD. However, there is a shortage of minority HD scientists,
especially among health professionals whose training places them in a unique position to address HD. The
proposed training program addresses these gaps by providing minority students with specialized global HD
research training. The training programâs aim is to encourage and prepare individuals from diverse
backgrounds to conduct HD research and to prepare for careers with the primary goal of improving minority
health and reducing health disparities. The training program will be strengthened by existing exchange
agreements and by two existing centers of excellence at the University of Miami School of Nursing and Health
Studies (UMSONHS) â 1)The NIMHD-funded Center of Excellence for Health Disparities Research: El
Centro/The Center for Latino Health Research Opportunities (CLaRO), and 2)The PAHO/WHO Collaborating
Centre for Nursing Human Resources Development and Patient Safety. We will partner with 7 institutions in 6
countries - Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Mexico, and Peru - where the UMSONHS
and the University of Miami established student study abroad programs and training/research agreements. The
program will support 10 trainees per year. Students will participate in a 2-week Intensive Global Health
Disparities Summer Research Institute, immediately followed by a 10-week research experience. Students will
work closely with mentors in the host country and at the UMSONHS during this time to conduct global HD
research. Upon return, students will participate in a 1-week seminar on research dissemination and preparing
for a career in HD research. During the seminar, the students will share their experiences with one another,
both informally through group discussions, as well as formally through presentations of their research projects
and findings. Students will also participate in a writing workshop and they will prepare the first draft of their
manuscript, which will be submitted to a peer-review journal within 6 months of returning from their experience.
Students will continue to work with their mentors well beyond this 13-week period to prepare scientific
presentations and publications and to apply to graduate school and/or other HD research career opportunities.
The program will be evaluated for process and outcome indicators annually, and trainees will be tracked yearly
for a period of 10 years to assess program impact on the intermediate and long-term goals of the training: a
career in HD research (e.g., pursuing a PhD) and success as an HD researcher."
10874603,"Abstract
Research conducted within the Duke Universityâs Superfund Research Center (DUSRC) will study
neurodevelopmental health impacts of early-life co-exposures to PAHs and metals. Metals (particularly Pb) and
PAHs are among the top 10 contaminants identified at both Superfund and Brownfield sites, and they often co-
occur. Therefore, exposure to mixtures of these contaminants is very common. And unfortunately, the
communities that are often more impacted by these exposures are people of color, which can further contribute
to the growing health disparities in the United States. Despite their co-occurrence, evaluations of their risks
typically neglect the impacts of co-exposures. As a result, site management strategies often try to discretize the
multi-contaminant problem, leading to remediation targets that are based on health risks associated with a single
exposure rather than real-world mixtures. Our overarching goal within the DUSRC is to investigate co-exposures
that âreplicate the human experienceâ, as described by NIEHSâs Strategic Plan to advance environmental health
science. More specifically, our Center will study the impacts of multiple contaminant exposures in humans and
ecological models of neurodevelopmental health, elucidate neurotoxic mechanisms that occur from these co-
exposures, and develop remediation and treatment strategies that target the highest risk contaminants without
increasing the risk of other contaminants. This integration is central to evaluating the true risk from exposure to
hazardous substances. The DUSRC directly addresses the program mandates by investigating health effects
and risks and remediation of hazardous substances in an interdisciplinary fashion. Our interdisciplinary team of
toxicologists, exposure scientists, environmental chemists, engineers, epidemiologists, and community based
environmental managers, provide the DUSRC with a unique opportunity to address and examine this complex
problem using a systems approach. In addition to responding to SRP mandates, the DUSRCâs research,
research translation, and community engagement activities are also highly relevant to numerous stakeholders
at the local, regional and federal levels. Our work will provide key data and information needed to address
several problems relevant for the Superfund Research program."
10788280,"Abstract:
Of an estimated 2.5 million people with epilepsy in the United States, close to 250,000 (~10%) have Juvenile
Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME). The majority of patients with JME experience seizure onset during a neuro-
developmentally vulnerable period and are at risk for long term cognitive and psychiatric comorbidities which
carry significant associated socioeconomic and health-care utilization costs. Medications can yield lasting
seizure control in some JME patients and mitigate the progressive neurodevelopmental consequences of
chronically uncontrolled seizures, but for many JME patients medications do not adequately control seizures.
Accurate early prediction of which patients will respond favorably to medications is crucial for optimizing
selection of treatment options, but current methods for predicting the clinical course and response to treatment
of JME remain inadequate. There exist no reliable biomarkers that predict the likelihood of drug resistance,
disease progression, or the presence, nature and severity of cognitive or psychiatric consequences of JME, all
of which vary widely between patients. Powerful imaging tools are now available for quantitatively
characterizing structural and functional connections between brain regions that make up epileptic networks,
providing a promising new approach for understanding, predicting, and treating refractory epilepsy. The
Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy Connectome Project (JMECP) will collect detailed structural and connectivity
measurements in 160 children and adolescents of age range 12-20 yrs (80 JME, 80 healthy controls) including
DTI to evaluate structural connections and fMRI to evaluate dynamic network interactions and structural MRI to
evaluate patterns of cortical and subcortical volume loss. The methods will closely mirror those currently used
by the Human Connectome Project (HCP) to study network connectivity in healthy participants. These
comparisons, based on large cohorts studied with sensitive, state-of-the-art methods, will investigate the full
extent of abnormal network structure and function in JME. The data will be used to test several important
hypotheses: 1) that recurring seizures lead to progressive connectivity abnormalities in JME, 2) that these
connectivity abnormalities are linked to the cognitive and psychosocial dysfunction, 3) that severity of
connectivity abnormalities predicts the risk of prospective decline in cognitive, psychosocial function, and in
developing medically refractory seizures, 4) that connectivity abnormalities unique to participants with JME are
associated with disease-related variables such as epilepsy duration, seizure type providing important novel
biomarkers. Evidence supporting these hypotheses will lead directly to novel clinical tools for diagnosis &
personalized management of JME patients based on quantitative imaging of connectome."
10784069,"Project Summary/Abstract
Recent breakthroughs in tumor immunology led to the development of cancer immunotherapies which have been
successfully applied to a range of human cancers. Among the immune cellularity in the tumor microenvironment,
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are often the most abundant immune cells and play critical roles in tumor
immunosurveillance. Recent progress demonstrates that cancer cells upregulate anti-phagocytic âdonât eat meâ
signals as self-protective mechanisms against macrophage surveillance. When these signals are blocked,
macrophages are capable of eliminating various malignant hematopoietic and solid tumor cells through cellular
phagocytosis. Inducing cancer cell phagocytosis demonstrates significant anticancer effects and therapeutic
potential in preclinical models and recent clinical trials. Tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation,
mediated by protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), is an essential
mechanism underlying signal transduction involved in multiple critical biological functions including the regulation
of immune responses. PTPs such as SHP1/SHP2 have been shown to be involved in the inhibitory signaling in
macrophages and T cells for deactivating immune activities. Despite its importance, however, the underlying
molecular mechanisms of macrophage-mediated cancer cell phagocytosis are still unclear, and the critical
components mediating this process in addition to cell surface receptors have mainly remained unidentified. In
this proposal, we are focusing on the functions and roles of PTPs in macrophage immunosurveillance. Through
a CRISPR-based loss-of-function screening in macrophages, we have identified non-receptor PTP candidates
that negatively regulate phagocytosis. When their expression is suppressed, the phagocytic ability of
macrophages toward cancer cells is significantly enhanced. Our central hypothesis is that such PTPs function
as inhibitory regulators of macrophage-mediated cancer cell phagocytosis, and thus their inhibition can promote
the efficacy of macrophage phagocytosis-based cancer immunotherapy. In this proposal, we will first investigate
to what extent the deficiency of inhibitory PTPs in macrophages promotes the efficacy of cancer cell phagocytosis
with multiple preclinical models. Second, we will dissect the molecular mechanism of how deficiency of PTPs in
macrophages augments cancer cell phagocytosis. Finally, we will examine the anticancer efficacy of suppressing
PTPs in macrophages with in vivo cancer models. The completion of this study will identify and establish the
roles of new regulators of cancer cell phagocytosis and inspire the development of new therapeutic strategies to
enhance the efficacy of macrophage-based cancer immunotherapy."
10792574,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is estimated to occur in one third of the general population and is a major predisposing factor in the pathogenesis of hepatic insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D). NAFLD occurs when lipid supply to the liver exceeds rates of lipid oxidation and lipid export. A number of therapies have been employed to reduce ectopic-fat accumulation in liver and hepatic insulin resistance, however these approaches have been met with limited success in the long-term and new therapies are required. In order to meet this great unmet need, our lab has recently developed a Controlled Release Mitochondrial Protonophore (CRMP) that is functionally liver-targeted and causes increased mitochondrial fat oxidation by promoting a subtle sustained increase in hepatic mitochondrial uncoupling activity. Importantly, we have previously demonstrated that CRMP safely reverses hypertriglyceridemia, fatty liver, steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis in rodent models of NAFLD/NASH/liver fibrosis and T2D without inducing hyperthermia, weight loss or any associated hepatic/systemic toxicities. Taken together, these rodent studies provide important proof of concept for the further assessment of CRMP as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of NAFLD/NASH and T2D in a highly relevant non-human primate model of NAFLD and the dysmetabolic syndrome. Therefore, in the present proposal, we aim to determine the safety and efficacy of chronic CRMP treatment on the reversal of hypertriglyceridemia, NAFLD, and liver and muscle insulin resistance in dysmetabolic, spontaneously obese Rhesus monkeys. In addition, we will perform a comprehensive set of hepatic metabolic flux measurements using state-of-the-art liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy methods to directly assess the impact of chronic CRMP treatment on rates of hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, gluconeogenesis, pyruvate dehydrogenase flux, pyruvate kinase flux and hepatic ketogenesis in this obese dysmetabolic monkey model of NAFLD. We hypothesize that chronic CRMP treatment will reverse NAFLD and improve whole-body insulin responsiveness in obese dysmetabolic Rhesus monkeys in a safe and effective manner by promoting increased rates of hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation independent of changes in food intake/body weight. Collectively, the results of this research will be highly impactful in that they will provide important proof-of-concept and safety data in a highly relevant clinical model of obese dysmetabolic non-human primates to support the development of novel liver-targeted mitochondrial uncoupling agents for the treatment of NAFLD/NASH and T2D in humans."
10657629,"Project Summary
Esophageal cancer has a higher incidence rate in US veterans than the general population, and
its prognosis is generally poor with a five-year overall survival rate of less than 20%. While
most clinical trials focus on patients with metastatic esophageal cancer, novel therapies added
to curative intent chemoradiation and surgery in patients with localized esophageal cancer have
the greatest potential to improve overall survival rates. Patients who achieve a pathologic
complete response on esophagectomy after chemoradiation have a five-year overall survival
rate of 50%. Thus, a worthy goal is to increase the number of patients who achieve a
pathologic complete response. Treatment of esophageal cancer cells and xenografts with
itraconazole, a commonly used antifungal medication, inhibited cellular proliferation and AKT
and Hedgehog signaling, two pathways suspected of mediating chemoradiation resistance. In a
completed phase 0 trial, we found that a two-week course of oral itraconazole given before
chemoradiation was safely tolerated by patients and successfully inhibited AKT and Hedgehog
signaling in tumors. We now propose a single-arm phase II trial in which 78 patients will receive
oral itraconazole for an eight-week course between standard of care chemoradiation and
esophagectomy. The rationale for administering itraconazole during this period is several fold:
1) if AKT and Hedgehog signaling are upregulated by chemoradiation in esophageal cancer,
then more cancer cells would be susceptible to itraconazole after chemoradiation; 2) we can
administer itraconazole for a longer duration than in our phase 0 trial; and 3) patients are not
actively being treated during the proposed administration time period which provides a window
of opportunity. Our primary endpoint will be the pathologic complete response rate as assessed
by pathology review at the time of esophagectomy in these 78 patients as compared to 156
contemporary propensity score-matched controls. Secondary endpoints include 1) determining
if plasma and esophageal levels of itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole in all patients and
molecular pathway status in residual tumors correlate with treatment response and 2)
determining if circulating tumor DNA levels, as measured by Natera's Signatera test, correlate
with treatment response. As part of the Signatera test, we will also obtain germline and somatic
tumor whole exome sequencing data from each patient. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis
that itraconazole will increase the pathologic complete response rate by at least 15% compared
to controls. Specific Aim 2 will determine if treatment response correlates with drug and
metabolite levels in plasma and esophageal tissue and AKT and Hedgehog pathway status and
microvessel density (VEGFR2 pathway status) in residual tumors. Specific Aim 3 will utilize
whole exome sequencing of untreated tumors to develop a comprehensive genomic profile that
predicts treatment response (precision medicine) and determine if treatment response and
recurrence-free survival correlate with circulating tumor DNA levels in the blood as measured by
Signatera."
10848484,"Emerging experimental and observational data suggest that the immune system is susceptible to the influence
of early life exposure to exogenous factors. The immune system begins to develop in utero, and continues to
undergo tightly regulated developmental processes through adolescence and early adulthood. However,
knowledge remains scant regarding how environmental exposures earlier in life modify susceptibility of immune
cells to functional deficits throughout childhood and into adolescence, especially for the human immune system.
Current evidence that environmental exposures perturb human immune function during early life is primarily
limited to infants and young children. Presently, there is almost no information about how these observations
relate to immune function during other critical developmental stages, such as adolescence. The objective of this
project is to define how exposure to a specific category of environmental agents, polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs), during key developmental periods, affects immune functions throughout childhood and into
adolescence. The proposed work builds directly on findings that higher infant PCB levels are strongly associated
with lower vaccine responses and greater respiratory morbidity in a birth cohort in eastern Slovakia. The
proposed work will examine adaptive immune function and infection in 400 adolescents from this cohort. Building
on our finding that 6-month PCB levels were inversely associated with anti-BCG specific antibody levels, our
first aim will determine IgG- and IgA-specific anti-BCG and -MMR levels at 45 months, and 7 and 16 years of
age. Leveraging extensive pre- and postnatal exposure data, this will allow the estimation of age-specific PCB-
antibody associations, as well as permit the estimation of vaccine response trajectory over time. This aim is
particularly important since vaccines administered in infancy are intended to create durable responses that
contribute to protection as children age. Our second aim examines PCB exposure in relation to functionality of
distinct B cell and T cell subsets. Higher PCB concentrations are associated with lower antibody levels to
vaccination in several studies. However, the mechanism is not known, and specific lymphocyte sub-types and
functional capacity remain poorly characterized: data from this aim will help fill this knowledge gap. In the third
aim, we will use PCR-based methods to measure the frequency of 22 common respiratory pathogens over a 1-
year period of follow-up, including asymptomatic and symptomatic collections. We will also abstract physician-
diagnosed lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) from birth through 16 years. With these measured endpoints,
associations between pre- and postnatal PCB concentrations and symptomatic and asymptomatic respiratory
infection will be assessed. By extending research with this established cohort from birth to adolescence, we will
obtain new information about how this category of common pollutants impacts the human immune system."

10569561,"ABSTRACT
The overarching goal of this proposal is to lower the age of detection in autism to early infancy, making
presymptomatic (i.e., before the emergence of ASD-specific behavioral features) intervention feasible. Infants
with an older autistic sibling have up to a 20% risk of developing autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Prospective
high familial risk (HR) infant sibling studies have shown that the defining behaviors of ASD do not emerge until
the latter part of the first year and into the second year of life. Therefore, the vast majority of affected children
are diagnosed after age 2. No behavioral markers in the first year of life have yet been identified that can
predict later ASD diagnosis with sufficient accuracy (i.e., positive predictive value: PPV â¥ 80%) to justify
presymptomatic intervention. We recently published two independent approaches that use brain imaging in the
first year of life to predict which HR infants will be diagnosed with ASD at 2 years of age. Specifically, structural
MRI (sMRI) at 6 and 12 months of age, and resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) at 6 months of
age independently predicted later ASD diagnosis in HR infants with over 80% PPV. Our preliminary data show
that a third MRI approach, using regions of CSF volume and cortical shape at 6 months of age can also
accurately predict later ASD diagnosis. If we replicate and extend these findings, we will be able to identify
individual infants at âultra-high riskâ (80% chance) of developing ASD, rather than being limited to group-level
risk (20% chance), where we do not know who will later be affected. This R01 application aims to move our
initial findings toward a clinical test for ASD in HR infants in the first year of life. Aim 1 will validate our previous
findings in a new, independent sample of HR infants, extend our methods to a new MRI platform, and examine
whether fcMRI and/or sMRI, with and without behavioral information, during the presymptomatic period in
infancy, accurately predict ASD diagnosis at 24 months of age. Aim 2 will move beyond predicting categorical
diagnosis to predicting dimensional, clinically-relevant characteristics for individual infants. Specific
dimensional targets include expressive language level, social responsiveness, initiation of joint attention, and
repetitive behavior. Validating and extending our findings on presymptomatic prediction of ASD in a new
sample, on a different MRI scanner, and with dimensional developmental characteristics are critical next steps
for moving the field forward toward (a) the development of a clinically-useful, presymptomatic test for
identifying ultra-high risk infants who would benefit from very early intervention in infancy, (b) efficient studies
of presymptomatic intervention strategies in individuals at ultra-high risk, and (c) the development of future
presymptomatic tests for use in the general (not just HR) population."
10595502,"Background. Medication treatment of Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) saves lives and is increasingly delivered
virtually. Currently, 60% of VA outpatient addiction treatment occurs over video. The pandemic accelerated this
trend, but it will be sustained through multiple VA policies. However, toxicology testing, a major component of
MOUD care, currently requires in-person visits. A process for virtual point-of-care toxicology testing is needed.
Significance. In current virtual MOUD care, toxicology testing is either not completed or requires in-person
urine testing, which is inconvenient and stigmatizing. A process for virtual point-of-care testing, which mitigates
these barriers, will be developed through this research. Such as process will be more acceptable, facilitate
patient-centered care, and decrease stigma, improving MOUD utilization and patient outcomes. This research
will directly address VA stated goals to âImprove MOUD implementationâ and âUnderstand how to address
stigma.â
Innovation. MOUD care, which incorporates (1) virtual toxicology testing, (2) patient self-testing at the point-of-
care, and (3) oral-fluid test kits, is entirely novel. There has been no research on virtual point-of-care toxicology
testing among Veterans. In addition, virtual toxicology testing will advance other innovative addiction
treatments such as virtual contingency management.
Specific Aims. This research will develop a Virtual Point-of-Care Toxicology Testing Process for VA. AIM 1
(Pre-Pilot) will design and iteratively modify a Virtual Toxicology Testing Process, which uses oral fluid test kits.
AIM 2 (Pilot Trial) will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and proximal effects of the process by evaluating
provider and patient testing uptake, qualitative feedback, and health service use. AIM 3 (Scale-up) will (1)
prepare a Virtual Point-of-Care Toxicology Testing Toolkit and (2) operationalize testing for a future multi-site
randomized trial.
Methodology. Mixed-methods will be used to develop and evaluate the testing process, which will use an oral-
fluid test for common drugs of abuse. Patients will self-administer the test during virtual MOUD visits and
assess results with providers. In the pre-pilot phase, stakeholder groups of VA-wide clinical/laboratory leaders,
providers, and patients will design and iteratively modify the process. In the pilot phase, a single-arm mixed-
methods pilot trial will evaluate the process among patients and providers at two VA facilities. Feasibility will be
evaluated by examining process uptake. Acceptability will be evaluated through semi-structured interviews with
patients and providers based on Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) constructs.
Health service use will be evaluated by analyzing data on patient characteristics, test utilization, and treatment
contacts extracted from the electronic medical record. In the scale-up phase, the Virtual Point-of-Care
Toxicology Testing Process will be summarized in a toolkit for VA-wide distribution. The toolkit will (1) identify
tests meeting VA requirements; (2) develop education materials; (3) specify procedures for administering and
analyzing tests; and (4) specify additional activities such as confirming results, ordering tests, and documenting
results.
Next Steps/Implementation. The Virtual Point-of-Care Toxicology Testing Toolkit will be disseminated using
current VA addictions informational and didactic resources and venues. The toolkit will be operationalized for a
future multisite, randomized hybrid trial evaluating the effectiveness of virtual toxicology testing compared to
testing as usual."
10792573,"This industrial-academic collaboration seeks to analytically validate a highly specific and sensitive
multiplexed immunoassay for glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) and tau in serum and/or plasma to improve
treatment decisions for neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). HIE, which affects
approximately 1 in every 1,000 births, is a major cause of death and disability for children. Prompt whole body
cooling of neonates improves outcomes in some cases; however, 24% of cooled neonates die from HIE, and
19% of survivors develop cerebral palsy despite best available treatment. Adjuvants to hypothermia promise
to broaden the effectiveness of treatment. Clinical testing of these investigational adjuvants has been slow due
to the difficulty in identifying neonates who are most likely to benefit from treatment. By prescreening neonates
at the extremes of the injury spectrum, an objective simple blood test that stratifies neonates according to
injury severity and monitors treatment responses would accelerate trials of investigational adjuvants.
 The multiplex employs a novel format with approximately 100-1,000x higher sensitivity than regular
immunoassays, which improves quantitation in the clinically relevant ranges of these low abundance
biomarkers. Our preliminary data demonstrate that our new assay format is sufficiently sensitive to measure
GFAP and tau in serum and plasma. Collaborators at Johns Hopkins University (Drs. Everett and Northington)
have demonstrated clinical utility of GFAP and tau as markers of injury severity and functional outcomes in
HIE. This proposal seeks to fully develop and optimize the ultrasensitive multiplex using our phase-gated
process, followed by extensive analytical validation.
 First-year tasks are extensive characterization of key critical reagents, assay fine-tuning, and establishment
of analytical controls at key concentrations for stratifying neonates according to HIE severity. A risk analysis
will be performed, and the effect of preanalytical factors and potential interferents will be assessed and
mitigated. In year two, the design will be frozen and transferred to manufacturing. QC protocols for critical
reagents will be established and executed, and components will be configured following MSDâs ISO
9001:2015-certified quality management system. Three kit lots at final design will be manufactured. Assay
performance will be assessed throughout the project, and include testing of clinical samples. A formal
analytical assay validation plan will be developed in collaboration with a clinical chemist (Dr. Sokoll from JHU),
with input from the NIH Program Officers, and based on the 2018 FDA Bioanalytical Method Validation
Guidance for Industry. The final analytical validation study will be performed at three sites: MSD, Johns
Hopkins Hospital, and All Childrenâs Hospital. Multi-site testing will include testing of proficiency samples, a
20-day reproducibility study, and a lot-to lot comparison. Additionally, real-time and accelerated stability tests
will be performed in year 4."
10620105,"Background: One third of post-9/11 Veterans in VHA suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and
among those who initiate Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), up to 70% drop out before receiving an
adequate dose of treatment. Unfortunately, Veterans who drop out prematurely may never receive the most
effective components of CPT. Thus, there is an urgent need to use empirical approaches to identify the most
effective components of CPT, so that CPT can be adapted into a briefer format. The long-term goal of this line
of research is to adapt, test, and implement brief, evidence-based treatment for Veterans with PTSD. The
overall objective of the current application is to adapt CPT into a brief, effective format. The rationale is that
identifying the most effective intervention components and delivering only those components will make CPT
deliverable in a shorter timeframe, thus improving efficiency, reducing drop-out related to poor treatment
response, and ensuring that Veterans receive the most beneficial components of treatment, which will
significantly improve their quality of life.
Significance/Impact: Upon completion of this project, we expect to have produced an empirically-based, brief
version of CPT. This contribution is likely to improve clinical practice for Veterans with PTSD by providing the
most effective components at an earlier session, thus increasing the overall effectiveness of treatment and
mitigating the negative consequences of untreated PTSD, such as lost productivity, substance use, later-life
physical disability, reduced quality of life, and increased risk of suicide.
Innovation: The status quo for PTSD treatment is lengthy psychotherapy in a specialty mental health setting,
which is rarely delivered in its entirety. The proposed research is innovative because it will use a novel
engineering-inspired framework, the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST), to adapt this effective
psychotherapy into a brief format. Developing a brief, empirically-based version of CPT will open new horizons
for PTSD treatment by expanding CPT access to treatment settings where lengthier treatments are not
feasible. It will also provide effective options for Veterans who desire a briefer treatment course.
Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Using a highly efficient experimental design, identify which of five CPT
components contribute meaningfully to reduction in PTSD symptoms. We will test the effectiveness of each
component and each two-way interaction between components. Specific Aim 2: Identify mediators of
component effectiveness. We hypothesize that effects will be mediated by engagement/adherence and change
in posttraumatic cognitions. Exploratory Aim 1: Identify moderators of component effectiveness.
Methodology: The MOST is an innovative engineering-inspired framework that uses an optimization trial to
assess the performance of individual intervention components within a multicomponent intervention such as
CPT. Guided by the MOST framework, the goal of the proposed project is to empirically inform an abbreviated
version of CPT via a highly efficient fractional factorial design. Veterans (N = 270) at two VAMCs with clinically
significant PTSD symptoms who meet minimal inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive one or
more CPT components. This design will test the effectiveness of each component and each two-way
interaction between components, as measured by PTSD symptom reduction on the Clinician-administered
PTSD scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) across six months of follow-up.
Implementation/Next Steps: Upon completion of these aims, our expected outcome is an adapted,
abbreviated version of CPT that consists of the most effective elements of the intervention. The adapted
intervention will be primed for a future large scale, fully powered effectiveness trial. The adapted intervention
can be easily disseminated through the VA CPT training program and will have a positive impact on the health
and wellbeing of Veterans with PTSD."

The central hypothesis of this program project grant is that our knowledge of tumor genomics and the
microenvironment, combined with our understanding of normal tissue biology, can be exploited to protect normal
tissues from radiation (RT) damage while selectively killing tumor cells, leading to an improved therapeutic index.
The projects and cores that comprise this grant represent a highly integrated effort with a single focus of
widening the therapeutic index of radiotherapy. Project 1 (Giaccia) will modulate the radiosensitivity of
tumors and radioprotection of normal tissues via the complement pathway and will aim to understand the
mechanistic basis of how inhibition of C5aR1 serves to sensitize gastrointestinal (GI) tumors and protect
abdominal tissues from RT. They will also explore the role of C5aR1 inhibition in other normal tissues in
collaboration with the other projects and cores. Project 2 (Le) will focus on activating Aldehyde Dehydrogenase-
3A1 (ALDH3A1) to mitigate RT-induced severe dry mouth in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients by testing d-
limonene, a novel ALDH3A1 activator identified by their group, in a phase I clinical trial. While focusing on HNC,
they will evaluate the effect of d-limonene in radioprotecting other normal tissues in collaboration with the other
projects and cores. Project 3 (Diehn) will develop a personalized radiosensitization strategy for patients with
KEAP1/NFE2L2 mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) based on their prior work that identified mutations
in this pathway as key determinants of radioresistance in NSCLC patients. They will test the hypothesis that
glutaminase inhibition preferentially radiosensitizes KEAP1 mutant NSCLC without enhancing normal lung tissue
toxicity. While concentrating on NSCLC, they will also evaluate the effects of glutaminase inhibition in other
KEAP1/NFE2L2 mutant tumors and its effect on normal tissues in collaboration with other projects and cores.
Project 4 (Rankin) tests the hypothesis that inhibition of FTO (Fat mass and obesity-associated protein), an RNA
demethylases, would enhance the efficacy of RT in multiple solid tumors. This is based on their preliminary data
showing that FTO is overexpressed in many cancers including cervical, lung and HN cancers, that FTO inhibition
reduces cancer cell growth and enhances RT sensitivity through the inhibition of glutamine metabolism. They
will determine the therapeutic effects and mechanism of action of FTO inhibition in combination with RT in
multiple cancer models in collaboration with the other projects and cores. They will also study the effect of FTO
inhibition on normal tissue response to RT. If successful, D-limonene, a nutraceutical, can be rapidly tested in
larger phase II and III clinical trials for future clinical use. Similarly, PMX 205 (a C5aR1 inhibitor) and CB-839 (a
glutaminase inhibitor) are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for other clinical indications while drugs
targeting FTO are in active development. Thus the proposed projects could rapidly lead to clinical studies that
could impact the management of cancer patients."

Protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is crucial for organism fitness, and its disturbance during aging underlies
age-associated neurodegenerative diseases. It is well known that the pathology of Alzheimerâs disease (AD) is
associated with disruption of proteostasis, leading to aggregation of Ã-amyloid (AÃ) and hyperphosphorylated
Tau. However, it remains unclear the cellular and molecular mechanism by which proteostasis is disrupted by
AD during the aging process. Lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are two groups of organelles that
play crucial roles in regulating cellular homeostasis and organismal health. Lysosomes are highly metabolic
active and contain various enzymes dedicated to the hydrolysis of specific substrates. At the same time,
othersâ and our studies also reveal the signaling role of lysosomes, which is tightly linked with the metabolic
status of the lysosome. On the other hand, ER is essential for protein synthesis and utilizes quality control
mechanisms to maintain proteostasis. To date, it remains poorly understood how mechanistically lysosomal
metabolism and signaling regulate ER proteostasis. In our studies using Caenorhabditis elegans, we have
discovered a novel lysosome-to-nucleus retrograde signaling pathway that links lysosomal NADPH metabolism
and ER proteostasis, and also revealed the crucial role of this lysosomal signaling in AD prevention during
aging. Strikingly, this lysosomal signaling pathway carries molecular, cellular and biochemical conservation in
human. In this proposal, we aim to systemically decipher lysosomal and nuclear components of this signaling
pathway in C. elegans, and to elucidate how this pathway controls ER proteostasis and contributes to AD
pathogenesis in the mammalian nervous system. The proposed studies, although designed in animal models
(C. elegans and mice), will set a stage for understanding the role of lysosomal metabolism and lysosomal
signaling in human health and diseases. The successful accomplishment of this project will advance our
current knowledge regarding lysosomal function and signaling in aging and AD, open a new avenue for
understanding AD pathogenesis during aging, and shed light on the prevention and treatment of AD patients in
our current society and future generations."

Despite significant advances in the understanding of the neurobiology of alcohol use disorder (AUD), there is a
gap in the translation of these insights into clinical applications. Translational research in AUD is facilitated by
the use of experimental manipulations and theoretical constructs that can be studied across species. Towards
advancing translational research in AUD, the PI completed an Exploratory/Developmental Project entitled:
âModeling alcohol reward and reinforcement in the human laboratoryâ (R21 AA022752). The objective was to
develop and test a translational task of motivation for alcohol in humans. To do so, we combined alcohol
challenge with progressive ratio self-administration methodologies. Alcohol was administered intravenously
using the Computer-Assisted Self-Infusion of Ethanol (CASE) system. At BrAC = 0.06 g/dl, participants
completed a progressive ratio self-administration task in which they were allowed to work to be infused more
alcohol following a progressive ratio schedule. The alcohol self-administration task captures motivation for
alcohol and mirrors preclinical methodologies, ideal for testing of translational hypotheses. In addition to
developments in the âoutcome sideâ of the modeling approach, the âpredictor sideâ comprised of AUD
phenomenology has progressed towards clinical translation. The Addiction Neuroclinical Assessment (ANA)
proposed to parse AUD phenomenology into three domains, namely incentive salience, negative emotionality,
and executive dysfunction. Our research group has recently provided an independent replication of the ANA
framework in a sample of 1,679 heavy drinkers. Together with the innovation in outcome assessment (i.e.,
progressive ratio self-administration in humans), the ANA framework can inform staging of AUD progression
and as such, motivation for alcohol in humans provides an ideal behavioral science outcome. The proposed
R01 application builds upon the extensive work from our laboratory on the development of a translational task
for drinking motivation in humans. It does so by testing the three dimensions of the ANA for their effects on
alcohol motivation in individuals with AUD."

Insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion are traits that have a significant impact on the risk of type 2 diabetes
(T2D). The over-arching goal of this proposal is to understand the pathophysiology underlying variation of
these intermediate phenotypes in Mexican Americans, the largest US minority group and one at high risk of
T2D. The Genetics Underlying Diabetes in Hispanics (GUARDIAN) Consortium represents the largest effort to
identify the genetic determinants underlying diabetes-related intermediate phenotypes (DK085175). During the
previous funding period, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) focused on common genetic variation
identified four genome-wide significant loci underlying variation in glucose homeostasis traits which translated
to the clinical endpoint, T2D. In this application, we will build upon significant prior genetic findings with
integration of biological (metabolomics) and analytical (hierarchical clustering and interaction analysis)
approaches to further refine insulin resistance and insulin secretion phenotypes and explore their biological
basis. Aim 1 will develop a novel methodology using existing GWAS and metabolomics data to impute
genetically regulated metabolites (GReM) and test their association with measures of glucose homeostasis in
the GUARDIAN Consortium. Aim 2 will refine known and novel variants associated with T2D and related
phenotypes through hierarchical clustering and perform interaction analyses which exploit the bimodal nature
of T2D to identify additional insulin resistance loci. Aim 3 will identify genetic determinants of dynamic
measures of glucose homeostasis in diverse human populations and translate these loci to T2D. The unique
strengths of this proposal include detailed phenotypes for glucose homeostasis that have not been extensively
examined in the GWAS setting, a focus on the Mexican American population, and our long-standing, highly
productive collaborative team. This project has great public health significance as it is focused on increasing
our biological understanding and resultant mechanisms for the prevention of T2D using pre-diabetic measures
of glucose homeostasis."

Abstract â Overall Component
 In order to highly align with the Strategic Plan of the University of Oklahoma (OU) to create the
multidisciplinary Research Centers of Excellent in one of the primary research themes namely, the future of
health, the overarching objective of this COBRE application is to establish a new medical imaging center for
conducting the translational cancer research by leveraging the established research supporting resource and
collaboration network between the biomedical engineering and clinical research in OU. This COBRE will provide
research infrastructure along with the multidisciplinary leadership and mentoring teams to support the promising
research project leaders (RPLs) of the junior investigators as they establish independent research careers. An
essential component will be providing support for innovative research projects that develop and apply novel
medical imaging technology and quantitative imaging predictive markers to translational cancer research. The
success of these research projects will make impact and contribution to the future of health including the advance
of the precision medicine to significantly improve efficacy of the personalized cancer risk prediction, screening,
diagnosis and treatment. Since 2012, OU has developed and established a collaborative network and diverse
portfolio of research projects that bridge the biomedical imaging engineering faculty in the Gallogly College of
Engineering (GCoE) with the physician scientists or clinical researchers in the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC).
Building on our experience in conducting joint translational cancer research using medical imaging technology,
this COBRE aims to support and further develop this collaborative research infrastructure between the GCoE
and SCC to enhance the research capability and progress of the RPLs as they further develop the team-based
and translational research projects. In order to promote the translational research projects with potentially high
clinical impact and significance, this COBRE will include the RPLs with both biomedical imaging engineering and
clinical research training backgrounds. Each RPL will also have two senior mentors with expertise in biomedical
engineering and clinical research, respectively, to further enhance the collaborative research approach. In
summary, in order to enhance the medical imaging related translational cancer research capacity in OU and
ensure RPLs to establish independent research careers, we propose the following three Specific Aims in this
COBRE: (1) to implement a dedicated program for mentoring RPLs in their proposed research projects and
enabling them to become independent researchers with non-IDeA external research support; (2) to strengthen
and develop new research infrastructure and shared resources to support current and future medical imaging
related translational cancer research projects; and (3) to foster and enhance the multidisciplinary collaborative
research activities between the biomedical engineering faculty and physician scientists or clinical researchers to
facilitate the outstanding translational medical imaging related cancer research projects."

The overarching goal of the proposed Johns Hopkins P.O.E. Total Worker Health Center in Mental
Health (POE Center) is to promote worker mental health and well-being through research, education,
outreach and evaluation activities that integrate the psychosocial, organizational, and environmental
contexts of worker health. Given the rapid evolution of who works, how they work, and where they workâ
changes that have accelerated given employer and governmental response to the COVID-19 pandemicâthe
workforce and workplace are being transformed in ways that will have lasting consequences post-pandemic.
Since a large proportion of human life is spent at work, workplace exposures (including psychosocial) are an
important contribution to population health or illness. This supports the critical need to not only identify how
large-scale disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic will modify the workforce and workplace in relation to
worker mental health, substance use and well-being outcomes, but also to identify and empower resilient
systems for health protection and health promotion to maintain workforce functions, health, and well-being
before, during and after crises. We will address the following aims: 1) To create a NIOSH Total Worker
HealthÂ® center that serves the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) in Total Worker HealthÂ®
(TWH) with intentional focus and resources on mental health and substance use prevention and treatment
among workers; 2) Integrate concepts of psychosocial, personal, organizational, and environmental context
into TWH monitoring and evaluation; and 3) To evaluate POE Center activities in outreach, training,
dissemination, and research, and to support the overall goals of the POE Center and NIOSH TWH program.
Given the special issues related to mental and behavioral health, including the alarming frequency of problems,
the very real barriers due to stigma and privacy concerns, and the hidden costs due to presenteeism versus
absenteeism, a NIOSH Total Worker Health center specifically dedicated to worker mental health is greatly
needed."
10760204,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, where currently 5.8 million
people are living with AD dementias, and this number is projected to almost triple to 13.8 million by 2050. In
addition AD and related dementias (AD/ADRD) healthcare costs for people â¥65 years were an estimated $277
billion in 2018. Although putative risk and protective factors have been identified, published studies have been
unable to identify how to prevent and mitigate disease progression and who is most vulnerable mostly because
the existing studies are based on small sample size and lack statistical power to disentangle the effects of
different factors. Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) (a ubiquitous yet modifiable exposure dangerous to
the aging brain) has been associated with decreased cognitive function, faster cognitive decline, dementia, AD,
and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Toxicological and human studies provide evidence of an association
between air pollution and neurodegeneration, highlighting potential biological pathways that include systemic
inflammation and oxidative stress. In response to PAR-17-054, our goal is to leverage massive nationwide
datasets (Medicare and Medicaid), coupled with advanced statistical methods, to overcome the limitations of
existing studies and clarify risk and protective factors for AD/ADRD. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will conduct
national epidemiological studies using Medicare and Medicaid claims for the period 2000-2021 for the continental
US, to estimate the association between exposure to air pollution and the time to the first AD/ADRD
hospitalization. Among enrollees that have been hospitalized for AD/ADRD or MCI we will assess whether air
pollution exposure increases risk of mortality, and/or accelerates re-hospitalization for AD/ADRD. In Aim 2 we
will apply machine learning methods to identify co-occurrence of individual-level (previous hospitalizations, race,
age, and sex), environmental (weather, green space, and noise), and SES risk (or protective) factors to
determine which population subgroups are most/least at risk for AD/ADRD hospitalization and progression
following air pollution exposure. In Aim 3 we will develop methods to overcome statistical challenges including
(1) disentangle the effects of air pollution exposure from other confounding factors by leveraging approaches for
causal inference, and (2) correct for potential outcome misclassification. We will conduct side-by-side
epidemiological analyses using traditional methods (e.g. regression) and causal inference and machine learning
approaches to understand which statistical challenges require more sophisticated approaches. To ensure
transparency and reproducibility, we will provide peer-reviewed open-source software so other investigators may
implement our methods. In summary the results of this proposal will characterize the link between air pollution
exposure and AD/ADRD hospitalization and progression, will identify the multiple modifiable risk and protective
factors that determine vulnerability in AD/ADRD, and provide the foundation for implementable actions to prevent
and reduce this enormous health burden."
10817834,"The mechanism of mechanosensing by polycystins during cell growth
Cytokinesis is the last stage of cell division when two daughter cells separate, but it is equally important for the
transition to cell growth including cell size expansion. The mechanism regulating such a transition is poorly
understood. We identified the role of calcium and the polycystin channel Pkd2p in this process while studying
cytokinesis of the model organism fission yeast. Pkd2p is essential to regulate the cell size and it mediates
calcium influx. Polycystins are evolutionally conserved ion channels. Loss of function mutations of human
polycystins lead to the genetic disorder, Autosomal Polycystic Kidney Disorder (ADPKD). The cellular function
of this highly conserved family of channels is not well understood. This study will determine how Pkd2p and
calcium regulate the transition to cell growth.
Aim 1. Determine how the Hippo signaling pathways regulate Pkd2p. Our genetic screen has identified the
fission yeast Hippo pathways SIN and MOR as crucial for the regulation of Pkd2p. Both are highly conserved
kinase cascades that are essential for cell proliferation. SIN antagonizes Pkd2p activity, while MOR synergizes
with Pkd2p. However, the mechanism is unclear. We will 1) Determine how MOR and SIN regulate cellular
calcium during cytokinesis through calcium-imaging. 2) Determine how MOR and SIN regulate Pkd2p in cell size
expansion. 3) Determine how MOR promotes the cell cycle-dependent localization of Pkd2p. 4) Determine
whether Pkd2p is a direct substrate of the MOR kinase Orb6p. Aim 2. Determine how the Pkd2p channel is
activated. Pkd2 channel opens in response to mechanical force in vitro, but the mechanism is unclear. We will
test the proposal that Pkd2p is a channel sensitive to the force driving the yeast cell growth. We will 1) Determine
how Pkd2p regulates calcium when the cells are stimulated by external force. 2) Probe how Pkd2p senses
osmotic stimuli and the lipid environment in vitro through a collaboration with Allen Liuâs group (University of
Michigan). 3) Determine whether Pkd2p channel allows ions other than calcium to pass through, using patch
clamp, through a collaboration with Du Jianyangâs group (University of Tennessee). Aim 3 Determine how
Pkd2p regulates the actin re-organization during cytokinesis. Calcium can activate two highly conserved
molecules Cam1p and Ppb1p. We will determine how they contribute to the role of Pkd2p in cytokinesis. We will
determine 1) how Pkd2p regulates the Cam1p-dependent endocytosis during cytokinesis. 2) how Pkd2p
regulates the Cam1p-dependent intracellular transport. 3) how Pkd2p regulates the enzymatic activity of Ppb1p.
Through this study, we expect to uncover a novel cell size regulation pathway mediated by Pkd2p channel. We
will demonstrate how both internal signaling pathways and external environment play a vital role in activating
this channel in cytokinesis. We will employ novel imaging methods combined with innovative in vitro techniques
in our study. Our works shall help us better understand the cellular functions of the human polycystins."
10741756,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy allows the non-invasive detection of low-concentration
metabolites within the brain, free from overlap from other, more abundant compounds. Until recently, spectral-
editing techniques have generally focused on measuring individual metabolites in one brain region at a time
(for instance, the well-known âMEGA-PRESSâ method). However, this is a time-consuming approach which
severely limits clinical applicability when multiple metabolites and/or brain regions are involved. The main goal
of this proposal is therefore to develop and establish the reproducibility edited experiments that can detect
multiple edited molecules in multiple brain regions, all within a single acquisition.
 We will develop multi-voxel localization techniques to combine with our recently developed multi-metabolite
editing methods, including the Hadamard-encoded âHERMESâ approach as well as the new âHERCULESâ
method which allows for up to 13 metabolites to be simultaneously determined. For applications that may
require a limited number of voxels to be acquired, we will developed multi-band excitation and parallel
acquisition âPRIAMâ methods in combination with HERMES and HERCULES. For applications that require
greater spatial coverage and/or the ability to map out the spatial distribution of metabolite levels, edited MR
spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) techniques will be developed for use in combination with HERMES and
HERCULES editing. Since edited-MRSI is very sensitive to head motion and other instabilities, acquisition and
processing methods will be implemented for robust, motion-insensitive edited-MRSI.
 Rigor and reproducibility will be carefully assessed; newly developed methodologies will be validated by
comparison to conventional measurements in the same subjects. Expected improvements in temporal signal-
to-noise ratios and reproducibility will also be measured. The resulting data acquisition and analysis tools will
be made available for dissemination to the clinical neuroscience and neuroimaging communities."
10758847,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Identifying modifiable biopsychosocial factors that can reduce the high proportion (>20%) of injured patients who
transition from acute pain (AP) to chronic pain (CP) could reduce the burden and disability from this condition.
Maladaptive cognitive-behavioral strategies (e.g., fear-avoidance beliefs; catastrophizing) and emotional factors
(e.g., general distress) are consistently associated with post-injury pain, especially in patients with pre-injury
psychological vulnerabilities. However, it is unknown whether these psychological processes are causal in the
transition from post-injury AP to CP, and are thus a target for CP prevention. For this K01 proposal, I will conduct
a prospective cohort study in 200 motor vehicle crash patients with musculoskeletal injury to determine the
temporal associations between maladaptive psychological processes and the development of CP. Preliminary
data support the feasibility of recruitment and retention, the use of electronic communication, and collection of
longitudinal data among trauma patients. We aim to: 1. Examine the concurrent association of psychological and
physiological (heart rate activity and 24-hour activity patterns) processes with average levels of injury-related
pain intensity throughout 3-months post-injury; 2. Determine the time windows when specific maladaptive
cognitive-behavioral and emotional processes appear during the transition from injury-related AP to CP; and 3.
Assess the biopsychosocial moderators of the transition from injury-related AP to CP. We will intensively examine
interactions of cognitive-behavioral and emotional factors from the point of injury (emergency department) to
acute (< 4 weeks), subacute (â 4 to 12 weeks post-injury), and chronic (> 12 weeks post-injury) time periods.
We will augment traditional retrospective self-report surveys with prospective ecological momentary assessment
(EMA) via text messages and biomarkers of distress via Fitbit devices. This project will foster career development
through hands-on training in: 1. The design and conduct of rigorous prospective research on the transition to
CP/disability after musculoskeletal injury and on clinical trial design for secondary pain prevention; 2. The use of
multimodal techniques to measure and monitor post-injury maladaptive psychological and physiological
responses and pain-related processes; 3. The data management, analysis and interpretation of a prospective,
longitudinal study with intensive data collection; and 4. Grantsmanship skills. These proposed research and
training activities will capitalize on the multidisciplinary environment at the University of Pittsburgh to advance
strategies for pain prevention. This goal is well-aligned with the NIAMS Long-Range Plan for FY 2015-2019 to
use multidisciplinary, multilevel, and non-pharmacological approaches to prevent chronic pain (CP) in the injury
population at large. This K01 application will help the PI launch an independent program of impactful patient-
oriented research to become an independent investigator with expertise in: 1) the psychological contributors to
CP, and 2) prevention efforts to reduce the burden of CP and improve recovery after acute physical injury."
10767766,"Myocphenolate mofetil (MMF) and tacrolimus are the main immune suppressants used in over 90% of kidney
transplants (tx). Several studies have shown an association between low mycophenolic acid (MPA, active
metabolite of MMF) exposure as measured by 12 hour area-under-the-curve (AUC) and acute allograft
rejection. However, significant inter-individual variation in the pharmacokinetics (PK) of MMF exists with as
much as a 10-fold variation in AUC with the same dose. Elevated MPA concentrations have been associated in
some studies with toxicities such as diarrhea, leukopenia and anemia. PK studies show a second peak of MPA
6-8 hours after oral MMF from enterohepatic recycling (EHR) of MPA due to biliary excretion of its phenolic
glucuronide (MPAG, major inactive metabolite of MPA). EHR occurs by hydrolysis of the glucuronide by Î²-
glucuronidases produced by gut bacteria and reabsorption of MPA. Extensive EHR greatly increases systemic
exposure to MPA and likely enhances immunosuppression and toxicity. Î²-glucuronidases are produced by the
gut microbes Streptococcus agalactiae, Clostridium perfringens, and E. coli and are known to influence drug
substrates and potentially the extent of EHR. In a pilot study of stool from tx patients, Bacteroides,
Ruminococcus, Coprococcus, and Dorea were significantly lower in tx patients with diarrhea. The specific
hypothesis is that certain patterns of stool microbiota lead to increased EHR, greater MPA systemic exposure
and toxicities. Therefore, we will determine the association of microbiome with: MPA and metabolite PK posttx
and EHR (Aim 1) and MPA associated toxicities such as anemia and leukopenia posttx (Aim 2). Lastly we will
determine the association of microbiome diversity with diarrhea in tx recipients on MPA posttx (Aim 3). A
prospective cohort of new kidney txs with serial stool microbiome samples will be developed and MPA and
metabolite PK and EHR measured (Aim 1), and subsequent assessment of leukopenia and anemia (Aim 2).
We will measure serial stool microbiome for association with diarrhea posttx (Aim 3). All subjects will be
followed for 12 months posttx for estimated glomerular filtration rate which is associated with long-term kidney
outcomes. The microbiome will be determined using innovative, shotgun sequencing for all aims, along with
Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) gene sequencing for fungi for Aim 3. We will use metatranscriptomics of
microbial Î²-glucuronidases, using RNAseq, to elucidate the mechanism through which the microbiome
influences MPA exposure, and MPA associated leukopenia and anemia, and posttx diarrhea. We will collect
patient centered outcomes of diarrhea using text messaging. By the end of the study, we will have developed
microbiota patterns that could be utilized as a predictive test for when MPA PK assessment is needed, for
selection of MPA dose to minimize toxicities. This study can lead to future use of select antibiotics or fecal
transplants to restore the microbiome thereby assuring normalized drug disposition and minimal MPA related
toxicities. We will have created a model to study other drugs that undergo EHR or which have perturbed
absorption or distribution due to the microbiome."
10768537,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Background: Worldwide there are estimated to be 2.9 million cholera cases annually. Effective targeted water,
sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions are urgently needed to reduce cholera globally. Our study in
Bangladesh found that individuals living within 50 meters of a cholera patient were at 30 times higher risk of
developing cholera than the general population during the first week after the index patient sought care at a
health facility. However, there has been little work done to develop and evaluate interventions for this high risk
population. Objective: Our objective is to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a ring WASH intervention in
reducing cholera infections and increasing sustained WASH behaviors in transmission hotspots around cholera
cases. Previous studies: Our research group developed the Cholera-Hospital-Based-Intervention-for-7-Days
(CHoBI7), a WASH intervention delivered to cholera patients and their household members in a health facility.
Our randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Bangladesh of CHoBI7 demonstrated this intervention was effective in
significantly reducing cholera, and led to sustained increases in handwashing with soap and improved drinking
water quality 12 months post-intervention in cholera patient households. This intervention, however, solely
focused on cholera patients households. There are no studies to date that have evaluated the impact on
reducing cholera of delivering a ring WASH intervention to households living near cholera patients. Design and
Setting: The Director of Disease Control at the Bangladesh Ministry of Health and Family Welfare would like to
take CHoBI7 to scale across Bangladesh, and has requested we build evidence on scalable approaches for
delivering CHoBI7 in a ring around cholera patient households. This study will have 3 phases. During the
formative research and planning phase we will develop a scalable, theory and evidence based ring WASH
intervention through in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, workshops, and a pilot. During the
intervention implementation and evaluation phase we will conduct a RCT to prospectively follow 3120
participants from 1040 households living in 40 rings around cholera cases to evaluate the effectiveness of the
intervention in: (1) reducing cholera infections during the first week after the index patient in the ring seeks care
at a health facility; and (2) increasing handwashing with soap and stored water quality over a 12 month period.
The first arm will receive the standard recommendation given in Bangladesh during diarrhea outbreaks on oral
rehydration solution use and a leaflet on WASH practices during a single visit. The second arm will receive this
message and the ring WASH intervention which includes two home visits and mobile health messages. Whole
genome sequencing will be performed on water and clinical Vibrio cholerae strains collected to investigate
spatiotemporal transmission dynamics of V. cholerae in hotspots. During the dissemination and policy
planning phase, we will partner with the Director of Disease Control to disseminate study findings and inform
cholera control policies. Significance: This will be the first RCT of a ring WASH program to reduce cholera."

Congenital hydrocephalus (CH), the primary enlargement of the cerebrospinal (CSF)-filled brain ventricles,
affects 1/1000 births and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Although ~60% of all CH cases are
predicted to have a genetic etiology, known genes account for <5% of CH cases. Significant gaps in our
understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of CH impede the development of preventive, diagnostic, and
therapeutic measures. Fundamental obstacles to CH gene discovery using traditional genetic approaches
include locus heterogeneity, phenotypic complexity, and the sporadic nature of the majority of CH cases.
Whole exome sequencing (WES) has the potential to overcome these obstacles and has led to unprecedented
opportunities for gene discovery in autism and structural brain disorders. We recently used WES to identify four
novel CH genes, accounting for ~10% of studied CH cases (Furey et al., Neuron, 2018). All four genes are
required for neural tube development and regulate neural stem cell (NSC) fate. These results implicate
impaired neurogenesis, rather than CSF over-accumulation, in the pathogenesis of a significant subset of CH
patients, with potentially paradigm-changing diagnostic and therapeutic implications. As many causal CH
genes remain undiscovered, our objective here is to utilize a functional genomics approach to discover,
validate, and gain mechanistic insight into newly identified CH-causing mutations. Our hypothesis is that WES
will identify multiple novel CH genes, many of which will converge on pathways that regulate the NSC
development. Based on our experience that has been successful in identifying several CH and structural brain
disorder genes over the past several years, we now propose to ascertain additional sporadic CH case-parent
trios and Turkish consanguineous familial CH forms and perform WES on our large, well-phenotyped CH
cohort to discover novel de novo and transmitted CH gene mutations. This will be followed by analyses to
determine the expression patterns of newly identified prioritized genes during mammalian brain development.
We will then rapidly and inexpensively functionally screen prioritized CH candidate gene mutations for their
ability to recapitulate hydrocephalus using our novel, validated platform that utilizes live Xenopus embryos,
CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, quantitative optical coherence tomography, and real-time CSF particle tracking
(Date et al., Sci Rep, 2019, Accepted). For select validated genes, we will establish Xenopus lines to elucidate
the biological consequences of human CH mutations on cilia-regulated CSF dynamics and NSC
growth/differentiation and patterning. This functional genomics approach will elucidate the genetic architecture
of CH, and set the stage for more detailed future biological studies in mouse models beyond the scope of this
proposal. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to improve clinical management, prognostication,
surveillance, and genetic advice; stimulate research into new non-surgical therapies; and improve the quality of
our support for CH patients and their families."

intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML)-based methods to serve as early warning systems to address critical
health issues impacting young Africans in two domains: maternal, newborn and child health and mental
health. Our Hub addresses three critical needs across the translational spectrum of data science: 1)
Harmonization of multimodal data sources for meaningful use and analyses; 2) Leveraging temporal patterns of
data to identify trajectories through prediction modeling using AI/ML-based methods; and 3) Engaging with key
stakeholders to identify pathways for dissemination and sustainability of these models into target communities.
For our Maternal and Child Health Study (Project 1), we will leverage the large and diverse existing data sets in
Kenya, including two demographic surveillance systems, cohort studies and hospital data, to develop and
validate AI/ML-based prediction models to identify women of childbearing age at high risk for poor pregnancy
outcomes (e.g., pregnancy-induced hypertension, low birthweight) and non-communicable diseases later in life
and children at risk of future poor life outcomes (e.g., developmental delays). For our Mental Health Study
(Project 2), leverage existing surveillance data as well as novel mobile technologies (e.g., mobile apps,
wearables) for the development of existing and new AI/ML-based prediction models to identify adolescents and
young healthcare workers at risk of depression and suicide ideation in Kenya. Our Hub and Projects will be
supported by an Admin Core, Data Management and Analysis Core, and a Dissemination and Sustainability
Core, which will facilitate engagement with multisectoral stakeholders to identify sustainable model dissemination
pathways into target communities. Ultimately, our work will empower African researchers to carry forward the
UZIMA-DS Hub to address on-going and evolving health needs of Africans by building sustainable infrastructure,
expertise, and partnerships for long-lasting impact. The UZIMA-DS Hub can serve as a model that can be scaled
to other countries and health domains with the greater DS-I consortium to transform care delivery in Africa,
ensuring that current and future generations of Africans can achieve uzima."
10881916,"Project summary â MADIVA: Multimorbidity in Africa: Digital
innovation, visualisation and application Research Hub
Our research hub will develop data science to address the complex interplay, individual and public health
challenges, and rising prevalence of multimorbidity in Africans. Epidemiological transition in Africa has
greatly changed health risks at both individual and public health levels. Trauma, infectious & non-
communicable diseases are major health challenges; multiple occurrences multiply burdens for individuals
and communities. The inherent value from the increasingly rich and varied existing data has not been
exploited. We have rich longitudinal epidemiological data sets, partial but increasingly available clinical and
laboratory records, and genomic data. The data, as is common in the domain, is highly heterogeneous, and in
parts, fragmented and incomplete.
The Hub will be led by the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg collaborating with the African
Population and Health Research Center (Nairobi, Kenya), IBM Research Africa, the South African Population
Research Infrastructure Network and Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The initial sites are an urban
population in Nairobi, and a rural, transitioning, site in Bushbuckridge, South Africa: each has rich
longitudinal data of >100,000 individuals. Although incomplete, clinical records are increasingly being
captured digitally. Notably there is genomic data from a subset of individuals at each of the sites.
Multimorbidity is inherently multi-factorial â fragmented unlinked data retards solutions. Project 1 focuses
on linking. Integrated data sets will aid in understanding these communities, representative of many in Africa,
and protocols developed will be applicable elsewhere. A researcher dashboard will allow researchers to find
data and plan projects. A clinic dashboard will help clinic managers and health officials to monitor and plan
effectively. Project 2 will be solution-oriented to develop novel data science methods to provide actionable
insights. We will develop robust methods for risk profiling of individuals and communities using
heterogeneous data. We pioneer the use of polygenic risk scores in Africa. Key data science questions are
explicability of results and managing high-dimensional data without loss of power. An innovative aspect of
our grant will be translational work with public precision health to provide insights into drug dispensing,
pharmacogenomics, and behavioral or possible social interventions.
The Capacity Development & Pilot Project Core will support a tiered set of pilot projects for African
researchers at different career stages, leveraging our strong research platforms and networks. We aim to build
capacity in key areas including incubation and cost modelling for data science. The Administrative and
Leadership Core will provide the necessary leadership and project management and linking to other DS-I
components. The Data Management and Analysis Core will develop protocols for the responsible sharing of
data, data quality control, technical support as well as innovate new analysis techniques."
10756430,"Background: For the 80% of older Americans who have at least one chronic condition, sharing self-
management responsibilities with caregivers (relatives or friends) predicts longevity, better health, better
quality of life, and fewer hospitalizations. Caregivers often support patients in their self-management efforts.
This can bring patients and caregivers closer but can also generate stress for both that can interfere with self-
management. Yet, self-management programs rarely support the coping needs of patient-caregiver dyads.
Significance: There are more than 5 million caregivers of Veterans; 75% of older Veterans receive some
caregiver support. Caregivers incur individual financial and emotional costs even as they provide unpaid care.
Having an effective self-management strategy that addresses the needs of both can improve outcomes and
quality of life for millions of Veterans who suffer from chronic illnesses and their caregivers. This project
addresses the priorities âLong-term care and Caregiving,â âVirtual Care/Telehealth,â and âAccess to Careâ and
is consistent with the legislative goals of the MISSION Act.
Innovation and Impact: This highly innovative proposal uses the novel concept that strengthening the
interpersonal relationships between Veterans and caregivers can improve the self-management of chronic
conditions. It challenges current clinical paradigms by addressing the collective stress coping needs of dyads.
It is methodologically innovative because unlike many behavioral intervention trials, it assesses barriers and
facilitators to plan for future implementation. Our focus on technology-enabled tools is timely given how
COVID19 has transformed care delivery. This project takes advantage of the unique capabilities of the VA
health system to explore questions including robust caregiver support and virtual care programs.
Specific Aims: With investments from VA HSR&D, we have developed and successfully pilot tested a new
theoretically-derived technology called Web-based Self-care Using Collaborative Coping EnhancEment in
Diseases (web-SUCCEED). We propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial comparing web-SUCCEED to
an enhanced usual care (EUC) control. We will conduct a formative evaluation guided by the Consolidated
Framework of Implementation Research (CFIR) to accelerate future implementation.
1. Assess whether web-SUCCEED improves Veteran outcomes of self-management compared to EUC, 4
weeks and 6 months following randomization.
2a. Assess whether web-SUCCEED improves patient stress and quality of life.
2b. Assess whether web-SUCCEED improves caregiver stress, quality of life and caregiver burden.
2c. Examine communication, dyadic coping, mutuality, and relationship quality as mediators of primary and
secondary outcomes (Aims 1, 2a, 2b).
3. Guided by CFIR, conduct a formative evaluation involving key stakeholder interviews to understand barriers
and facilitators of future implementation.
Methodology: We will recruit 280 cognitively intact Veterans from VA Palo Alto Health Care System who are
managing at least one common chronic condition, and their caregivers. Veteran-caregiver dyads will be
randomized 1:1 to web-SUCCEED or EUC. Veteran and caregiver assessments will take place at baseline,
then again at 4 weeks and 6 months. The formative evaluation will be guided by CFIR and involve semi-
structured interviews with clinical staff, providers, and facility leaders in Year 4.
Next Steps: Our formative evaluation will set us up for implementation studies to evaluate web-SUCCEED in a
wider array of clinical settings and facilities. Existing operational partnerships will facilitate wider clinical
implementation and moving research into practice. Our innovative project, strong investigative team and
operational partnerships will ensure a successful study that has the potential to shift clinical paradigms."
10852792,"The purpose of the Center for Health, Work & Environment (CHWE) Center of Excellence in Total Worker Health
(TWH) is to advance the overall safety, health, and well-being of workers in Federal Health Region 8 and the
nation, through transdisciplinary research, effective interventions, outreach and communications,
education/training, and rigorous evaluation that inform improvements in all of the above. CHWE addresses the
need for research on Total Worker Health intervention strategies, focusing on the large number of workers and
workplaces at highest risk of occupational fatality, injury, and illness. Specifically, CHWE research will build on
the teamâs experience in creating innovative TWH interventions and practical outreach tools for small
businesses, the education industry, and other high-risk sectors such as agriculture. These groups employ a large
number of contingent, seasonal, underemployed, low wage, minority, and rural workers. There is an opportunity
to address serious gaps in transdisciplinary research that is needed to impact the well-being of these populations.
In addition, CHWE will apply and test both existing and new theoretical frameworks to improve generalizability
and efficacy of Total Worker Health interventions and dissemination strategies. CHWE has six goals:
1. Provide leadership and expertise in research and practice to integrate the protection from work-related safety
 and health hazards with the promotion of injury and illness prevention efforts to advance worker well-being.
(Leadership/Expertise)
2. Extend the research evidence base regarding the integration of protection and promotion of worker-related
 safety, health, and well-being. (Research)
3. Increase awareness, adoption, and implementation of Total Worker Health best practices, programs, and
 policies across the region through communication and dissemination, education, and implementation that is
 evidence-based, accessible, feasible, effective, and culturally appropriate. (Practice/Outreach)
4. Advance the adoption of policies that improve work-related safety, health, and well-being at local, state, and
 federal levels. (Policy)
5. Build Total Worker Health workforce capacity in public and private sectors, in academia, and in practice
 through education and strategic partnerships. (Capacity)
6. Improve Center impact through a rigorous evaluation program. (Evaluation)
Through our Research and Outreach Cores, CHWE will work across sectors, with a particular focus on the
agricultural sector, the service sector (education), and small businesses across all sectors. Each Core and
project reflects our commitment to addressing the Healthy People 2030 goals related to OSH, which are primarily
addressed through the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA). In particular, the NORA Healthy Work
Design and Well-Being (HWD) cross-sector is relevant to our TWH Center of Excellence goals and objectives."
10753559,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer survivors have 1.7-18.5-fold increased risk, and 1.3-3.6-fold increased mortality of cardiovascular
disease (CVD). Physical activity has been shown to ameliorate risk, but survivorsâ levels are far below the general
population. Due to this, provider physical activity recommendations and referrals are recommended by the
Institute of Medicine and the American Heart Association in survivorship care plans. In light of these
recommendations, barriers to physical activity participation among survivors exist at the provider, community,
and survivor levels. There is a critical need for implementation programs to connect these resources to increase
physical activity among survivors. To address this need, I developed, and beta tested a clinic-based eReferral
system referring patients to a nationwide community-based group program, LIVESTRONG at the Y, for survivors.
Due to COVID-19, we also referred to a virtual group program, Fit Cancer. The beta-test revealed the potential
of this approach; providers were engaged and referred survivors to the physical activity programs. It also
revealed the need for the eReferral to provide physical activity program choices, including a non-group self-
monitored digital health program. We, therefore, will build on the prior eReferral to develop and test
ActivityChoice in this 4-year proposal. ActivityChoice will include a patient narrative decision aid to support
choices to three evidence-based programs: LIVESTRONG (group in-person), Fit Cancer (group virtual), and
CareEvolution (Fitbit activity tracking and tailored messaging digital health). We found survivors prefer to hear
personal stories and support from other survivors to help support activity adoption, thus our decision aid will
include patient narrative stories to support program choices. In Aim 1, we will develop and test patient decision
aids to support choices with survivors and clinic staff and refine ActivityChoice. In Aim 2, we will conduct a
stepped wedge trial with clinic staff (n=8) at 3 UMass Cancer clinics sites, comparing an enhanced standard of
care control to the ActivityChoice implementation program in 70 patients with survivorship care planning visits.
We hypothesize ActivityChoice will have greater referral rates as compared to the enhanced standard of care
control. We will assess additional implementation outcomes, as well as exploratory physical activity and patient-
reported outcomes. In Aim 3, we will refine ActivityChoice and prepare for a multi-site trial through interviews
with stakeholders (survivors, clinic staff and administration) and potential future sites identified through our
collaborative networks. The refined program will be tested in a fully-powered effectiveness R01 trial submitted
in Year 4 of this project. To accomplish these aims, I will be guided by expert mentors and receive specialized
training in 1) Health and patient-provider communication, 2) Digital Health, 3) Advanced pragmatic clinical trials
and 4) Leadership and grant-development. This project will be conducted in collaboration with our clinical,
community and patient partners (Community Advisory Board) to guide the overall project design."
10846800,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Febrile infants are at risk for potentially fatal invasive bacterial infections, but clinical decisions vary widely and
thousands of infants may experience harms from under-testing or over-treatment. Practice variation costs up to
$700 billion each year and is associated with poor outcomes, low-quality care, and inequities. However, there
is a paucity of research examining the extent to which key sources contribute to practice variation, particularly
for febrile infants. Addressing this gap in knowledge is an essential first step to improve the effectiveness,
efficiency, and equity in care for febrile infants. Dr. Yaeger is a board-certified pediatric hospitalist whose prior
research has focused on understanding how clinical and social factors can improve child health outcomes.
This K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award will allow him to learn new
methods to investigate sources of practice variation, understand subsequent effects, and ultimately devise
interventions to reduce practice variation, improve outcomes, and decrease costs, thereby improving equity for
all febrile infants. The proposed studies and career development plan will directly support the candidate's goal
of becoming an independent clinician-investigator and expert in clinical decision-making and child health
equity. To achieve this goal, he has assembled an inter-disciplinary mentoring team from the University of
Rochester Departments of Family Medicine, Public Health Sciences, and Emergency Medicine. In addition to
completing relevant coursework, workshops, longitudinal training programs, and individual didactic sessions,
Dr. Yaeger will gain expertise from his team, who will guide him in achieving his Training and Career Goals.
These goals include gaining expertise and skills in: 1) decision science; 2) multi-level modeling, and; 3) mixed
methods. His research plan seeks to understand the extent to which disease rates, local supply of resources,
clinical characteristics, parent/caregiver preferences, and local practice culture contribute to practice variation
in febrile infants. The aims are: 1) To estimate practice variation and the extent to which disease rates and
local resources explain practice variation; 2) To examine contextual factors associated with practice variation;
3) To investigate the effect of a national clinical practice guideline on practice variation. He will accomplish Aim
1 using a state-wide, population-based administrative dataset and small area variation analysis framework to
estimate the extent to which key sources of practice variation contribute to differences in clinical decision-
making. In Aim 2, he will use a mixed methods approach to identify contextual factors that may contribute to
clinical decisions affecting practice variation. In Aim 3, he will investigate the extent to which a national clinical
practice guideline reduces practice variation. These career development activities, mentorship, and results of
these studies, provide a clear path for the candidate to secure independent funding to investigate pediatric
clinical decision-making and address inequities in child health."
11049505,"FAST-TRACK PHASE I and II ABSTRACT
Without treatment, chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can lead to cirrhosis of the liver, hepatocellular
carcinoma or liver failure. Current therapies effectively control the disease, but are rarely curative. The goal of
this proposal is to develop a therapeutic providing a âfunctional cureâ for chronic HBV infection, i.e., a therapy
producing sustained, undetectable HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and rcDNA (a measure of virions) in serum. A
functional cure will potentially benefit about 257 million people worldwide, including approximately 1.4 million
individuals with chronic HBV infection in the USA. The applicant, Evrys Bio, has recently described a host-
targeted vulnerability of viruses â the sirtuin family of deacylases, or SIRTs. SIRT modulators have broad-
spectrum antiviral activity against multiple, diverse viruses including HBV. Of direct relevance to this proposal,
Evrys has identified a SIRT2-inhibitor series with potent anti-HBV activity in cultured primary human
hepatocytes, blocking the accumulation of extracellular HBV rcDNA, HBsAg and HBeAg as well as intracellular
cccDNA â antiviral effects that suggest SIRT2 inhibitors have potential to contribute to a functional cure. Phase
I of this proposal will demonstrate the feasibility of Evrys SIRT2-inhibitors to treat HBV: Specific Aim 1 will
validate the reduction of cccDNA in infected hepatocytes. This aim will extend the results with HBV genotype D
to include HBV genotype A, generalizing the conclusion that HBV is inhibited by SIRT2 inhibitors; it will confirm
the qPCR-based conclusion that cccDNA levels are reduced by SIRT2 inhibitors by measuring cccDNA in
Southern blot analysis; and it will delineate the relative contributions of the in vitro block to accumulation versus
destabilization to the reduction of cccDNA levels by SIRT2 inhibition. Specific Aim 2 will determine a dosing
strategy for an exemplar of Evrys SIRT2-inhibitors in FRG KO huHep mice, identifying a well-tolerated dose that
can achieve the desired anti-HBV EC95. Specific Aim 3 will demonstrate feasibility using the exemplar to treat
HBV-infected FRG KO huHep mice. Phase II will develop a prototype: Specific Aim 4 will identify a development
candidate plus at least one backup for IND enabling studies from an existing series of nearly 600 Evrys SIRT2-
inhibitors. Specific Aim 5 will probe the mechanisms by which the development candidate blocks HBV
replication in human hepatocytes to facilitate clinical translation."
10913320,"ReproNim: A Center for Reproducible Neuroimaging Computation - Overall
Summary: Over the last two decades a vast technological, computational and societal infrastructure has
emerged transforming how information is collected and knowledge is gathered in all facets of science.
Neuroimaging, as a discipline, is uniquely poised to exploit these new technologies and infrastructure to
improve the way science is performed. Given the intrinsically large and complex data sets collected in
neuroimaging research, coupled with the extensive array of shared data and tools amassed in the research
community, we need to lower the barriers for efficient: use of data; description of data and process; sharing
and subsequent reuse of the collective âbigâ data. Aggregation of data and reuse of analytic methods have
become critical in addressing concerns about the replicability and power of many of todayâs neuroimaging
studies. The magnitude of this reproducibility issue indicates that a paradigm shift in the way we generate and
report knowledge in this field is in order.
Our BTRC resource, ReproNim: A Center for Reproducible Neuroimaging Computation, seeks to continue
to drive a shift in the way neuroimaging research is performed. Through the coordinated development of
technology and training, (each of which supports a comprehensive set of tools and skills in data management,
analysis and utilization of frameworks in support of both basic research and clinical activities), our overarching
goal is to improve the reproducibility of neuroimaging science and extend the value of our national
investment in neuroimaging research, while making the process easier and more efficient for
investigators. Reproducibility is critical to scientific advancement because the current literature contains large
numbers of erroneous conclusions (due to limited power, publication bias and occasionally mistakes). Given a
neuroimaging study, it is exceedingly difficult to discern between false positive and true positive findings as
data is hard to aggregate, and exact methods are hard to replicate or reuse. In order to advance the field in
terms of analysis and publication in a way that embraces reproducibility, the overall Center will have the
following aims: A) Deliver a reproducible analysis system comprised of components that include data and
software discovery (TR&D 1), implementation of standardized workflow description and development of
machine-readable markup and storage of the results of these workflows (TR&D 2) and development of
execution options that facilitates operation in multiple computational environments and reduces barriers to
scale and reliability (TR&D 3); B) Working with a community of Collaborative and Service users, we deploy,
test and validate the reproducible analysis system with a wide variety of use cases ranging from software
developers to applied scientists that support the archiving and reuse of raw data and the archival and reuse of
derived results to promote reproducible clinical research (and its publication) in multiple different application
areas; and C) Provide training and education to the community to foster continued use and development of
the reproducible and generalizable framework in neuroimaging research."
10821353,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT (Overall)
Precision-CARRS will revolutionize the cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention and care paradigm from
imprecise prediction with focus on late stage disease to personalized and precise prediction with improved
understanding of early-stage disease to maintain cardiovascular health. Atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) and
heart failure (HF) phenotypes are heterogeneous and result from complex interactions between immutable
genetic factors and mutable forces operating at environmental (e.g., ambient air quality), individual (e.g.,
health behaviors, social influence), and molecular (e, g, proteins, 'omics) levels. South Asians are an
understudied population at high CVD risk even at young ages, at low body weight, and in the absence of
traditional risk factors. We will leverage substantial matched resources, and also build upon the NHLBI-
funded CARRS cohort, a representative sample of n=21,864 South Asians aged â¥ 20 years, with ongoing
follow-up for clinical ASCVD risk factors, clinical disease, and mortality. The cohort has high retention (>95%
have at least one follow-up) and a biorepository of 360,000 stored samples. We will add detailed subclinical
and clinical CVD phenotyping, repeated measures of targeted protein markers and untargeted multi-omics,
and real-time assessment of health behaviors. By extending follow-up by an additional 5 years, we will
accrue 176,536 person-years of follow up, >1,000 incident ASCVD, and nearly >900 cases of clinical HF
(Stages C/D). Enabled by precise mapping of CVD at the granular level of subclinical and clinical
phenotypes, we will investigate the epidemiology and causes of CVD along both ASCVD and HF pathways.
Three complementary cores (Administrative and Field Coordination; CVD Phenotyping; and Data
Management and Analysis) will support four interconnected projects, one of which is led by an early-stage
investigator (ESI). All four project examine common subclinical and clinical endpoints from synergistic vantage
points: traditional risk factors and targeted protein-based pathophysiological pathways (Project 1), the impact
of air pollution and mediating mechanisms (Project 2), molecular signals and mechanisms through integrative
untargeted multi-omics (Project 3), and socio-behavioral influences on CVD risk and outcomes studied via
spousal dyads (Project 4, ESI). Precision-CARRS will unravel the natural history, pathophysiology, and
causal factors of vascular and myocardial disease and pave the way for precision CVD diagnostics,
prevention, and care for South Asiansâwho represent one fifth of humanity and are a rapidly growing sub-
population in the US. In summary, Precision-CARRS is designed to be a powerful platform to understand the
natural history of CVD in an understudied high-risk population and to spur future innovative scientific
collaborations with other CVD longitudinal cohorts in the US and globally."

The UIC Center for Healthy Workâs (CHW) aims to identify and promote employment programs, practices, and
policies that will improve worker and community health. Our vision is a future of work that promotes inclusive
and equitable opportunities for healthy work, and healthy work is recognized as a social and structural
determinant of health and a human right, a pathway to advancing systemic change and racial justice, and a
significant contributor to workforce well-being. Historical and systemic racism and injustices have led to
inequitable job opportunities and job quality for women, Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC), and
immigrants who are disproportionately employed in precarious jobs. The CHW aims to address these inequities
through racial justiceâcentered policy, systems and environmental (PSE) change initiatives to support
communities and institutions to build and sustain healthy work. The CHW specific aims are: 1) Conduct
research to produce evidence gathered through transdisciplinary and participatory, applied, and racial justiceâ
centered research to explore work as a social and structural determinant of health and identify actions to
promote healthy work; 2) Build and strengthen multidirectional collaboration and engagement across eco-social
levels to create networks that support healthy work; 3) Develop and expand the reach of PSE change initiatives
to build capacity to address precarious work across eco-social levels and geographical locations; and 4)
Translate and disseminate evidence to promote policies and practices that support healthy work and worker
well-being for all workers, within and outside the workplaces. The CHW includes 1) a Research Core that
designs and conducts participatory action research involving multi-disciplinary teams of investigators in
collaboration with community and organizational partners, 2) an Outreach Core which aims to facilitate a
strategic research translation agenda; to strengthen and expand networks of stakeholders, and to widely
disseminate Total Worker Health best-practices through multi-directional partner engagement and capacity-
building, and 3) a Planning and Evaluation Core which will provide leadership for the CHW, guided by an
internal advisory board and an External Advisory Committee. The CHW addresses precarious employment
across all economic sectors and supports the objectives of the Healthy Work Design and Well-Being cross-
sector council and advances Strategic Goal 7 in the NIOSH Priority Goals for Extramural Research. Our
research core uses Participatory Action Research (PAR) approaches where researchers and partners work
together to understand and address a complex topic and focus on social or policy change. This approach is
consistent with and advances the goals of r2p."
10558464,"Blood pressure (BP) measurement by a provider in the clinic, âattended clinic BPâ, is the primary method for
diagnosing and managing hypertension (HTN). BP may differ inside versus outside of clinic. Ambulatory BP
monitoring (ABPM) measures out-of-clinic BP. Compared with attended clinic BP, BP during the awake period
on ABPM (âawake BPâ) is a better predictor of cardiovascular (CVD) risk. Guidelines recommend ABPM to
identify white coat HTN (having high clinic BP but not having high awake BP) and masked HTN (not having
high clinic BP but having high awake BP). In most ABPM studies, white coat HTN is not associated with an
increased risk of target organ damage and CVD, whereas masked HTN is associated with a two times
increased risk of target organ damage and CVD. African Americans have a high prevalence of white coat and
masked HTN. A question has arisen: is there a better approach to measure clinic BP without the need to
conduct ABPM. One approach is to use an automated oscillometric device to measure clinic BP without a
provider present (âunattended clinic BPâ). In prior studies, compared to attended clinic BP, unattended clinic
BP has been closer to awake BP, suggesting that unattended clinic BP may reduce the likelihood of white coat
HTN. However, these studies had several methodological limitations: the order of clinic BP measurements was
not randomized; attended and unattended clinic BP were not measured in the same individuals; attended clinic
BP measurement was not performed according to guidelines; and samples were small, did not include African
Americans, and only included those with high clinic BP. Scarce data also exist on whether unattended clinic BP
reduces the likelihood of masked HTN. The goal of the study is to determine whether unattended versus
attended clinic BP is closer to awake BP on ABPM, and whether unattended versus attended BP reduces the
likelihood of white coat and masked HTN. We will enroll 2,775 adults from the fourth exam of the Jackson
Heart Study (JHS), an African American cohort. Unattended and attended clinic BP measurement will be
performed in random order using the same oscillometric device with attended BP performed according to
guidelines; 24-hour ABPM will be conducted. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and chronic kidney disease
(CKD) will be assessed. In Primary Aim 1, we will compare the mean absolute within-individual difference
between clinic BP and awake BP on ABPM when clinic BP is measured unattended versus attended. In
Primary Aim 2, we will compare the group prevalence of white coat HTN and masked HTN when clinic BP is
measured unattended versus attended. In Primary Aim 3, we will determine whether masked HTN, defined
using unattended clinic BP, is associated with LVH and CKD. This study will provide high quality empiric
evidence which may impact future HTN guidelines. If unattended versus attended clinic BP is closer to awake
BP on ABPM, and the likelihood of both white coat and masked HTN are reduced, then unattended BP should
be the primary method of clinic BP measurement and ABPM may no longer be necessary."

The proposed study is in direct response to two gaps in school-based aggression prevention programming and
research. First, there are very few culturally-sensitive relational aggression prevention programs with
documented success among high-risk urban minority girls and their classmates despite clear evidence that
these behaviors negatively impact girls' social and emotional health and the broader classroom environment.
Second, when such programming is conducted, it is often led by externally funded facilitators in the context of
a research grant, which does not equip school staff with skills to run the program and makes it exceedingly
difficult for schools to sustain programming efforts after research funding has ended. This is particularly
concerning in urban schools where aggressive students are often referred to counselors who typically do not
have the training and/or resources available for a proactive or systematic response. To address these gaps,
this proposal is grounded in the Friend to Friend Program, which was initially designed through an iterative
partnership-based research process uniquely for 3rd-5th grade minority relationally aggressive girls in urban
schools. Friend to Friend was proven effective through a clinical trial for decreasing relational aggression and
improving problem-solving and leadership of relationally aggressive girls with effects maintained one year later,
and for producing broader positive effects on aggression and student-teacher relationships for the classmates
of the aggressive girls. In the trial, Friend to Friend was conducted by research staff, and no schools continued
the program when the study ended. Therefore, preliminary studies were conducted to translate Friend to
Friend from researcher-led to school-led with coaching from the research team to address the imperative need
to build the capacity of schools to run programs on their own in an effective and sustainable way. As such, the
primary goal of this proposal is to examine for the first time the effectiveness of Friend to Friend with Coaching,
as conducted by teachers and counselors with active coaching from the research team. Through a cluster
randomized control trial including 40 urban schools, 20 schools will be randomly assigned to the F2F with
Coaching intervention and 20 control schools will follow standard school practice of referring aggressive youth
to the counselor. We will examine indicated and universal effects for students and self-efficacy of school staff
for intervening with relational aggressors. In addition, theoretical advances will be made by exploratory goals
related to understanding mediators and moderators of program success. Further, we will also explore the
effectiveness of Friend to Friend with Coaching the following year when minimal coaching is provided, as well
as the facilitators and barriers of program adoption by school staff. Collectively, this study will demonstrate the
effectiveness of school-led Friend to Friend with Coaching and the ways in which it works for improving the
social and emotional health of relationally aggressive girls and their classmates, and the study will also inform
considerations for sustainable program adoption and large scale dissemination."
10852809,"The states in Federal Region VII (Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska and Missouri) disproportionately suffer from higher
burdens of occupational injury and illness and higher rates of unhealthy behaviors compared to other regions
of the country. Our predominately rural region also has high rates of poverty and lower healthcare access. The
opioid epidemic and suicide have disproportionately affected the construction industry. Work patterns have
shifted due to technology and economic forces, accelerated by the pandemic, which has led to increased
remote work and increased stress on frontline workers, including nursing home workers. The experienced
interdisciplinary team of the Healthier Workforce Center of the Midwest will address these and other health
issues through research, outreach, and education. The Center's vision is to create a safe, healthy, and
productive workforce and will be achieved through basic and applied research, a participatory approach, and
theory driven educational and translational activities. The Center is a collaboration between the University of
Iowa, Washington University in St. Louis, the University of Kansas Medical Center, WorkWell Kansas, and two
NIOSH Total Worker Health Affiliates, the Nebraska Safety Council and the St. Louis Area Business Health
Coalition. The Center includes an Evaluation and Planning Core, which provides coordination, leadership,
evaluation, and an emerging issues program; an Outreach Core that translates evidence based findings and
provides education; and a Research Core which includes two large research projects: Preventing Suicide and
Promoting Mental Health in Construction Workers and Supervising the Future of Remote Workers: Promoting
Supervisor and Worker Well-being, two small research projects: Refining Workplace Opioid Guidelines for
Dissemination through a Social Marketing Approach and Implementation of Total Worker Health in Rural
Nursing Homes, and a Pilot Program that explicitly promotes career development and capacity building of
community and academic partners. Recognizing the greater impact of organizational changes, proposed Cores
focus not only on changes at the individual worker level, but also policies and programs to change work climate
and culture. The Center will address emerging issues and high-risk, high-need populations in employers of all

Food insecurity is known to be associated with metabolic and cardiovascular disease in adults. However, there
is a gap in our knowledge; specifically a lack of studies investigating factors that influence the emergence of
cardiometabolic risks from food insecurity during childhood and adolescence. An improved understanding of
the role of timing and severity of food insecurity on childrenâs cardiometabolic health (CMH), the
mechanisms/pathways between food insecurity and CMH, and the factors that buffer against or exacerbate this
risk are needed to inform intervention development to prevent later cardiometabolic disease amongst children
who are food insecure. The main objective of this prospective study is to understand how cardiometabolic risk
arises from food insecurity during childhood and identify malleable factors for intervention to buffer the negative
health impact of food insecurity on adolescentâs CMH. We will leverage an established cohort of
racially/ethnically diverse children from low-income households (n=627) participating in a prospective,
longitudinal study examining childhood obesity disparities (HL126171: Berge PI). Survey and ecological
momentary assessment (EMA) data have already been collected, including measures of food insecurity,
household environment (e.g., food environment, family functioning), child health behavior (e.g., diet quality,
sleep, physical activity) and parent behaviors (e.g., feeding practices, stress, coping) at two time points (~24
months apart) at ages 5-10. New measures proposed at ages 11-16 will include: (1) measures of CMH (Lifeâs
Simple 7 and state-of-the-science measures of body composition, metabolic and cardiovascular function,
oxidative stress and inflammation (i.e., cytokines)), (2) Geographical Information Services (GIS) data, and (3)
focus groups with families, school representatives, community organizations, and healthcare providers to
identify intervention targets and refine policies to reduce harmful health effects of food insecurity. Specifically,
this state-of-the art study will: (1) determine the impact of exposure to household food insecurity (i.e., severity,
timing) on child/adolescent CMH; (2) identify mechanisms/pathways between food insecurity and CMH; (3)
evaluate the extent to which child behaviors, parent factors, and access to resources impact the relationship
between food insecurity and CMH; and (4) using mixed-methodologies (biomarkers, focus groups, EMA, GIS),
prospectively examine the dynamics (e.g., severity, timing) of household food insecurity throughout childhood
and adolescence, and identify risk and protective factors at the level of the family, neighborhood, school, and
community to inform intervention and policy development. This approach is innovative because it represents a
departure from the status quo by focusing on when and how cardiometabolic risk emerges from food insecurity
during childhood and the multi-level factors which buffer against or exacerbate this risk, and significant
because it is expected to have implications for intervention development to prevent future cardiometabolic
diseases among adolescents from food insecure households."

 Advances in synthetic biology provide powerful tools to interrogate the complex relationship between
network structure and function. In this study, we will combine synthetic biology with computational modeling to
investigate network-mediated regulation of cell damage and deterioration, a complex biological process. As
similar studies in mammals are prohibitively time- and resource-intensive, we choose to focus on
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has proven to be a genetically tractable model for many fundamental
processes in mitotic cells and has allowed identification of many conserved genes that regulate cell-fate
decisions in eukaryotes. Emerging questions include how these genes interact and how the interactions change
dynamically to drive multi-generational cell deterioration dynamics. We recently found two distinct phenotypes
in genetically identical yeast cells as they approach cell death: one with decreased ribosomal DNA (rDNA)
silencing and nucleolar decline (Mode 1) whereas the other with heme depletion and mitochondrial decline (Mode
2). We found that stochasticity plays an important role in choosing one of the two paths, but once the fate decision
is made, it is almost always irreversible. We identified a core molecular circuit, consisting of the lysine
deacetylase Sir2 and the heme-activated protein (HAP) transcriptional complex, that governs the decision to
select one of these two paths. Based on the model, we were able to engineer cells to follow a third path with a
dramatically extended period of growth and survival, free of deterioration (Mode 3). In this proposal, we will
expand these efforts and systematically perturb and rewire the core circuit that controls cell fate in order to
reprogram its decision-making process. In Aim 1, we will use chemically-inducible promoters to control
expression of Sir2 and HAP and thereby modulate cell-fate decisions in isogenic cells. We will use microfluidics
to generate distinct, dynamic patterns of Sir2 and HAP expression and evaluate their effects on damage
accumulation, physiological changes, and cellular decline. In Aim 2, we will genetically rewire the core Sir2-HAP
circuit under the guidance of computational modeling and examine how these engineered circuits govern cell-
fate decisions and cell deterioration dynamics. In Aim 3, we will use high-throughput microfluidics to identify the
gene expression programs associated with Mode 1, Mode 2, and Mode 3 and examine how perturbations of
these programs affect multi-generational deterioration dynamics. These analyses will uncover the genes and
processes that underlie the missing connections between the Sir2-HAP core circuit and downstream modules
that underlie cellular decline leading to cell death. They will enable us to expand our computational model and
improve its predictive power. Throughout the study, we will construct deterministic and stochastic models, which
will produce testable predictions and guide engineering of synthetic gene circuits. If successful, this research will
advance a quantitative and predictive understanding of cellular fate decisions and cell deterioration."
10883882,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Alzheimerâs Disease (AD) is a chronic and disabling condition, the 6th leading cause of death in the US, and a
major cause of personal, societal, and global burden. Yet, our understanding of pathobiologic mechanisms
underlying dementia and cognitive impairment in aging remains incomplete, and this gap in knowledge hinders
scientific advancement and improved clinical care and prevention. Vascular conditions such as diabetes
mellitus (DM) are common, especially among minority racial groups, and recognized as increasing dementia
risk. Because these factors are modifiable by treatment and lifestyle approaches, research linking vascular
factors to Alzheimerâs Disease/ Alzheimerâs Disease-Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) is more important than
ever. Emerging data suggests that the epigenome likely plays a role in this link, and novel methods to study
the epigenome are now available. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is an epigenetic modification of cytosine
for which we can now measure genome-wide changes in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in blood and
genomic DNA (gDNA) in tissues. Our group has developed a highly sensitive and selective analytic approach
to capture and sequence 5hmC-containing DNA fragments in order to map genome-wide distributions, and
have successfully used this approach to develop 5hmC scores which distinguish between patients with and
without different conditions, including in recent studies of AD and DM. In response to the pressing need to
better understand the pathobiologic underpinnings of AD/ADRD, we propose a collaborative project with the
overall goal of elucidating epigenetic mechanisms linking vascular risk factors to AD/ADRD clinical and
pathological phenotypes, in older Whites and Blacks. The proposed study will leverage available resources
from two community-based cohort studies, including research participants from which to collect blood
specimens, as well as extensive longitudinal clinical data and postmortem neuropathologic data, and
biospecimens (e.g., frozen brain tissue samples). Among White and Black persons, we will collect new
genome-wide 5hmC data to generate serum-specific (Aims 1 and 4) and brain-specific 5hmC scores (Aims 2
and 4), using discovery and validation experiments in different sets of persons, that distinguishes between
persons with and without dementia. We will then link the blood and brain 5hmC data to AD/ADRD clinical and
pathologic phenotypes, including incident dementia and cognitive decline (Aims 1 and 4), cerebrovascular and
AD pathology (Aim 2). We will further examine if relations are differential by vascular risk factors (DM, blood
pressure [BP], and body mass index [BMI]) and by other factors (e.g., sex; Aims1-4), and if generalizable to
Black persons (Aim 4). Because vascular risk factors are common and modifiable, this study which will
elucidate 5hmC mechanisms in AD/ADRD and vascular diseases among White and Black older persons, will
fill a major gap in scientific knowledge about dementia and provide important data to inform future research
and to ultimately improve clinical dementia care and prevention."
10650282,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Essential tremor (ET) is a common neurological disorder and a leading cause of functional and psychological
disabilities that can be difficult to suppress with oral medications, many of which have considerable side effects
limiting adequate dosing. As a result, up to 20% of ET patients cannot achieve satisfactory control of their
symptoms and must consider interventional options. Focused ultrasound ablation (FUSA) of the ventral
intermediate nucleus (Vim) is an FDA-approved and Medicare-reimbursed procedure for ET resistant to
medications that can selectively ablate the brain area associated with tremor without the need for surgical
incisions or anesthesia. The success of Vim-FUSA depends on the ability to accurately ablate 70% of the Vim
volume without lesioning neighboring structures, a goal that is complicated by technical challenges in three
critical phases of the procedure: planning (identifying the Vim location and extension); delivery (ablating the Vim
volume with adequate accuracy); and monitoring (confirming Vim ablation with reliable intraoperative imaging).
 We propose to advance Vim-FUSA with the support of 3-D tractography, a neuroimaging technique to visually
represent nerve tracts within the brain. We hypothesize that 3-D tractography Vim-FUSA will improve the Vim
ablation compared to standard Vim-FUSA and prove safe and feasible in the clinical setting. We also hypothesize
that intraoperative magnetic resonance (i-MR) monitoring will differentiate ablated tissue from immediate
perilesional edema and accurately predict the Vim-FUSA clinical outcomes.
 Aim 1. Estimate and characterize the improvement in Vim ablation achieved with 3-D tractography
Vim-FUSA vs. standard Vim-FUSA in an experimental controlled animal study. Through an experimental
animal study, we will characterize the Vim ablation delivered with 3-D tractography Vim-FUSA in one hemisphere
(experimental group) vs. standard Vim-FUSA in the opposite hemisphere (control group).
 Aim 2. Test safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy, and estimate effect size of 3-D tractography
Vim-FUSA in a phase-II, two-groups, pre-post interventional human study. In a human study, we will test
the safety and feasibility of ablating 70% of the Vim volume while checking for side effects with intraoperative
clinical testing. Tremor assessments will be videotaped at baseline and 12 weeks and compared, in a blinded
fashion, with age-sex matched controls randomly selected from the video repository of the two FDA-regulated
studies of standard Vim-FUSA at baseline and 12 weeks.
 Aim 3 (Exploratory). Assess the accuracy of i-MR in differentiating tissue ablation from immediate
perilesional edema and its utility in predicting Vim-FUSA clinical outcomes. In the experimental animal
study, we will estimate and compare the accuracy of conventional and non-conventional i-MR in differentiating
tissue necrosis from perilesional edema. In the interventional human study, we will evaluate the utility of i-MR in
predicting Vim-FUSA clinical outcomes."

The Center for Environmental Health Sciences (CEHS) at the University of Montana proposes to continue its
Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP) experience for undergraduate science students (R25
ES022866). The SURP experience will provide undergraduate students an authentic immersion into conducting
research similar to that experienced by graduate students in environmental health sciences. Students will also
receive training in Environmental Toxicology and Biomedical Statistics. The program will provide the students
with additional training to give them confidence and guidance to pursue graduate education, with an emphasis
towards environmental health sciences. These goals will be accomplished by having students work on relevant
research topics of interest to them and developed by experienced investigators. Furthermore, specific additional
training will be provided in an interactive environment. Students will also be given information and guidance to
apply to graduate schools and enter graduate training. We intend to provide students of outstanding potential
the opportunity to experience high quality environmental health research activities. To address the need for
environmental health specialists who represent a diversity of social and cultural backgrounds we will actively
recruit students from disadvantaged and/or underrepresented groups. The CEHS is well positioned to execute
such a program, building on a rich portfolio of appropriate laboratory and field-based research in environmental
health sciences, and on past and current programs that focus on undergraduate education and research. The
goals of the program will be accomplished by: 1) Recruiting each year 5 undergraduate students who have
expressed a strong interest in pursuing a research career in environmental health sciences or related field and
paired with the appropriate faculty mentor and participate in an ongoing research project in the environmental
sciences; 2) Providing background training to improve the participantsâ preparedness for graduate school and
encourage their graduate study in environmental health sciences. Students will receive training in the
Responsible Conduct of Research, guidance in graduate school applications and background in grant writing,
writing skills and developing an oral presentation, which will be their culminating event; 3) helping students submit
abstracts to present posters for the Society of Toxicology annual meeting; and 4) Evaluating whether the program
achieves the goals of the program for the students and mentors."
10557234,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Wildland ï¬re smoke is a major contributor to air pollution in the United States (US) and is associated with a wide
range of health risks. The number and intensity of wildland ï¬res are expected to increase with a changing climate;
therefore, there is a pressing need to accurately quantify the extent to which wildland ï¬re smoke contributes to air
pollution levels and corresponding health burden, and to evaluate the effectiveness of preventative measures to
mitigate the health burden. However, this work presents many challenges. Exposure to wildland ï¬res clearly can-
not be randomized, so we rely on spatially-correlated observational data and causal inference. While there is an
impressive literature on causal inference for independent data, the methods available for spatial data are limited.
Progress in the spatial setting has been slow due to complexities induced by spatial correlations and interference,
i.e., the effect of treatment at one location depends on the response at nearby locations. We also analyze data
from Smoke Sense, an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-sponsored citizen science project designed to
engage citizens that experience the effects of ï¬re smoke using smart-phone applications (app). Citizen science
studies have transformative potential to amass valuable data and engage the public in scientiï¬c research, but can
be plagued by self selection of treatment and complex missing data patterns. The overarching theme of the
proposal is to develop a suite of casual analysis tools to analyze observational spatial data and data aris-
ing from smart-phone applications, handling interference, spatially-varying treatment effects, informative
missingness and spatial unmeasured confounders. In Aim 1, we provide a new formulation of spatial interfer-
ence using kernel distance functions. We extend marginal structural models and structural nested mean models
to the setting with spatial interference and propose doubly-robust estimators of direct and indirect/spillover effects.
We will apply this new method to estimate wildland ï¬re smoke effects on air pollution levels and health burden.
Because of subject heterogeneity in response to treatment, it is desirable to develop personalized recommenda-
tion strategies to determine which treatment works best, for whom, and under what circumstances. In Aim 2 we
propose a novel causal model that describes how treatment effects vary over space and with evolving subject
characteristics. Using the Smoke Sense data, we will estimate heterogeneous effects of app engagement and
preventative measures to mitigate the impact of wildland ï¬re smoke. We also propose an instrumental variable
approach to handling informative missingness, which arises frequently in studies with smart phone applications
and can lead to invalid inference if not properly addressed. In Aim 3 we build on our previous work to adjust for
missing spatial confounders by modeling the relationship between the treatment and the missing confounders in
the spectral domain and establishing conditions on their coherence that permit estimation of the treatment effect.
The methods will be disseminated using freely-available software and examined over a range of applications.
Therefore, the results of this project will have a broad impact on future environmental health studies."
10788364,"We propose to develop rectal cancer organoids (tumoroids) as
individualized models and to build a large rectal cancer tumoroid repository. Research on rectal cancers is
hampered by the paucity of models. Of the few existing in vivo models of rectal cancer, none place the tumors
in the rectal lumen, so the models fail to mimic the correct anatomic environment and local invasion. The
existing models also have not been observed to metastasize. Another problem is that we lack accurate means
to predict whether individual rectal cancer patients will respond to chemotherapy or radiation, both of which are
part of the current standard of care. We believe that both the paucity of models and the lack of predictive tools
can be addressed by patient-derived tumoroids. Tumoroids can be grown in 3-dimensional culture ex vivo or
implanted into mice, so they offer a flexible research platform. In preliminary results, we have derived tumoroid
lines from multiple patients' rectal cancers and found them to resemble the corresponding patient tumors. The
tumoroids, when implanted in mice endoluminally (i.e. in the rectum), formed locally invasive tumors capable of
metastasis. Moreover, we found tumoroids to have clinically relevant responses to chemotherapy and
radiation. Thus, drawing from these preliminary data, we hypothesize that rectal cancer tumoroids mirror the
traits of their original tumors, can be used to predict patients' response to therapy, and, when implanted
endoluminally into mice, can serve as an optimal model of rectal cancer.
We plan to develop 100 new tumoroids, which we expect to encompass much of the diversity of human rectal
adenocarcinoma. The tumoroids will be analyzed in ex vivo culture and in two mouse models: the endoluminal
implantation model and a conventional flank injection model. In these settings, we will test whether the
tumoroid accurately reflects its tumor of origin in terms of mutations, histology, and gene expression. We will
determine whether response of the tumoroids to patient-specific chemotherapy and radiation can predict the
corresponding patient's response. Of particular interest is whether individual human rectal cancers are more
accurately modeled by endoluminal implantation than by flank injection. Finally, to integrate our findings into a
comprehensive platform for broad use, we will develop a rectal cancer tumoroid biorepository seamlessly
integrated with online pathologic, genomic, and model-specific information. The online platform will be built
within our institution's cancer genomics portal, then integrated into the NCIP Hub. We have assembled a
collaborative team with expertise in colorectal surgical oncology, radiation oncology, and pathology; organoids;
mouse models; biostatistics; and bioinformatics. We anticipate that the proposed research will credential
tumoroids as accurate models for rectal cancer research and for predicting patient responses to therapy. The
large tumoroid biorepository is likely to stimulate research on new treatments for rectal cancer. The ultimate
result will be new treatment options and better treatment selection for patients affected by this deadly disease."

 We hypothesize manipulating brain energy metabolism through a ketogenic diet (KD) will benefit
Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. To test this hypothesis, we designed the âTherapeutics Diet in Alzheimer's
Disease (TDAD)â trial, a single blind, randomized, controlled study of a KD in AD participants. The TDAD will
evenly randomize 80 AD participants to a three-month KD or a Therapeutic Lifestyles Changes (TLC) diet
intervention. Aim 1 focuses on the clinical hypothesis and its primary endpoint analysis compares the mean
change in KD participant pre and post-diet ADASCog11 scores to the mean change in the TLC diet participant
pre and post-diet ADASCog11 scores. Secondary Aim 1 clinical outcomes include pre and post-intervention
changes in Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale sum of the boxes (SOB), mini-mental state exam (MMSE),
logical memory test (LMT), and Stroop test scores. Aim 2 determines how a KD affects human physiology,
and includes a biomarker-based assessment of depth of ketosis, mitochondrial function, insulin and insulin
signaling, lipid homeostasis, and inflammation. We will further co-analyze the Aim 1 and Aim 2 data to identify
relationships between physiologic parameters and cognitive performance.
 In Aim 1, comparing the magnitude of change in cognitive test and functional assessment scores between
the two groups will determine whether a high fat, low carbohydrate, ketone body-inducing KD truly and
uniquely benefits AD symptoms. The Aim 2 assessments will provide mechanistic insight into KDs, immediate
target engagement feedback, and over the long term help guide the development of future metabolism-based
AD interventions."

Neutrophils protect against infection but also mediate inflammatory tissue injury. As a result,
targeting neutrophils therapeutically will require a detailed understanding of their basic biology,
focused on domains wherein the defensive and pathogenic functions of neutrophils may diverge.
In the first cycle of the present award, we explored two related GPI-linked neutrophil surface
proteins of poorly-characterized function, Ly6G in mice and CD177 in humans. We showed that
both associate at a molecular level in cis with neutrophil surface Î²2 integrins and that their ligation
thereby attenuates neutrophil migration. Taking advantage of the experimental potential of murine
inflammatory models, we found that Ly6G ligation selectively reduced integrin-mediated migration
typical for neutrophil diapedesis toward sterile triggers, leaving integrin-independent migration to
infectious stimuli largely unperturbed. Our preliminary data now show that Ly6G differentiates
subphenotypes within murine neutrophils, while in humans CD177pos and CD177neg neutrophils
differ in gene expression and potentially cytokine production. Together with the productivity of the
first cycle of the award, these findings support deeper investigation of the role of these Ly6-family
molecules in neutrophil biology.
We propose two new and independent specific aims. Aim I pursues the mechanisms by which
Ly6G and CD177 alter neutrophil Î²2 integrin function, including a search for novel endogenous
counterligands. Aim II develops preliminary RNAseq data distinguishing neutrophil subtypes based
on expression of Ly6G and CD177, from healthy donors as well as from adults and children with
inflammatory arthritis and the transient but intensely inflammatory vasculitis Kawasaki disease.
Together, these studies will advance the understanding of neutrophils by defining how Ly6 family
members regulate ï¢2 integrins to control cell migration and by identifying neutrophil phenotypes
reflected in differential expression of Ly6G and CD177."

EPPIC-NET is part of the NIH Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) Initiative. More than 100 people die each day of opioid-related overdoses. Many of these can be traced to addiction related to the treatment of acute and chronic pain. There is an urgent need to develop non-addictive pain treatments to limit opioid exposures that can lead to addiction, as well as to treat pain conditions that are currently without effective treatments. The EPPIC- Net OT provides a robust infrastructure for the rapid design and execution of high-quality early phase clinical trials to test promising novel therapeutics and devices for the treatment of pain and for carrying out in-depth phenotyping and biomarker studies in patients with specific pain conditions. Such studies bring intense focus to patients with well-defined pain conditions and high unmet therapeutic needs. Studies funded under this award are described below.


EPPIC-Net Clinical Trial EN20-01
Project Title:  A 24-week Week Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of CNTX-6970 in Subjects with Moderate to Severe Knee Osteoarthritis Pain.


This trial will test the novel oral drug CNTX-6970 in patients with moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis pain. 150 participants will be enrolled at 20 EPPIC-Net sites across the U.S.  Preclinical studies of CNTX-6970, a C-C chemokine type 2 (CCR2) receptor antagonist, demonstrated potent analgesia in multiple pain models. Phase 1 clinical studies showed robust and dose-proportional target engagement and no emergent safety issues. The rationale for exploring CNTX-6970 for the management of pain in knee osteoarthritis stems from the emerging understanding of the pathophysiology of the affected joint as well as CNTX-6970 effects on neural signaling. Participants will be randomized to receive CNTX-6970, placebo, or an approved pain medication and will be followed for 24 weeks.


EPPIC-Net Master Protocol to Assess Treatments for Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy 


People with diabetes are at risk for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Diabetic neuropathic pain may be experienced as burning, aching, hypersensitivity to touch, or simply as pain. The currently FDA-approved medications for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN) provide inadequate pain relief for many. The EPPIC-Net Master Protocol for Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (Master Platform Protocol (MPP)) provides a platform for EPPIC-Net Phase II clinical trials testing therapeutic assets for the treatment of PDPN. The MPP provides the common over-arching structure with a modular design of required and optional elements to be included for study of each asset. All clinical trials under the MPP include HEAL Common Data Elements and required PDPN assessments as well as asset-specific procedures and measurements described in an Intervention Specific Appendix (ISA) to the MPP.


The following EPPIC-Net Clinical Trials will be conducted under the EPPIC-NET Master Protocol to assess treatments for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy:


EPPIC-Net Clinical Trial EN21-01


Project Title:  A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of 80mg daily of NRD135S.E1 Versus Placebo in Adult and Elderly Participants with Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (SERENDIPITY-1)


This award is for a clinical trial under the EPPIC-Net Master Protocol for Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy. The identification of NRD135S.E1 as a potential pain treatment is a true âbedside-to-bench"" story in modern-day translational medicine. NRD135S.E1 is a small molecule, a lab-optimized version of a natural substance traditionally used in a village in Siberia to brew tea to treat pain. In clinical studies, NRD135S.E1 was well tolerated by participants and showed clinically relevant pain relief. Study in EPPIC-Net will further development of this therapeutic asset as a possible treatment for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN). 260 adult participants with PDPN will be randomized to NRD135S.E1 or placebo in the 12-week, parallel design trial.


EPPIC-Net Clinical Trial EN21-02


Project Title: A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Parallel, 20-week, Phase 2b Study of Topical Pirenzepine (WST-057) or Placebo in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients with Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy


This award is for a clinical trial under EPPIC-Net Master Protocol for Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy to test a potential new topical treatment for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The therapeutic asset, WST-057 (topical pirenzepine 4%), is a molecule that was developed in the 1980s and marketed throughout Europe and Asia in an oral form to treat gastric ulcers. Preliminary studies showed an increase in nerve fiber density in the skin, suggesting it can enhance nerve regrowth and may help alleviate pain in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy as well. This EPPIC-Net study will enroll 260 participants at 12 clinical sites. Participants will be randomized to apply WST-057 or a matching placebo cream to the feet and calves for 20-weeks."
10547764,"Abstract
 The proposed project is a pilot clinical trial investigating a potential treatment for hippocampal
sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging). A major subtype of âAlzheimer's disease and related dementiaâ (ADRD),
HS-Aging affects 10-25% of all elderly individuals. HS-Aging is typically misdiagnosed as Probable AD
or AD-type dementia in the clinical setting. Unfortunately, there currently is no validated biomarker to
diagnose HS-Aging during life, and there is no known therapy.
 We will test the safety and efficacy of nicorandil for HS-Aging, based on our prior work elucidating
a pharmacologically targetable mechanism underlying the disease. Nicorandil is a vasorelaxant drug,
used clinically to treat chronic heart failure in the elderly population. Pharmacologically, Nicorandil is
an agonist for a protein (SUR2) that is encoded by a gene that we found to be linked to HS-Aging risk.
 Primary specific aims follow:
 Specific Aim #1: Evaluate safety and neurodegenerative biomarkers linked to HS-Aging
pathology in nicorandil vs. placebo treated subjects by:
 a. Conducting a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of nicorandil in 62
participants (both sexes, >75 years old, CDR 0.5 or 1, with HS-Aging profile in CSF and MRI
biomarkers [amyloid and phospho-tau negative, with evidence for hippocampal atrophy; A-/T-/N+])
over a 96-week treatment period; b. Evaluating the safety of nicorandil administration in the elderly at
risk for HS-aging (this is the primary outcome measure) that will inform future trial design; and, c.
Measuring structural MRI (3D-T1; hippocampal atrophy is the main efficacy outcome measure),
cognitive tests, and CSF levels of nicorandil, tau, phospho-tau, and AÎ²(1-42) at baseline and week 96.
 Specific Aim #2: Optimize and further explore HS-Aging biomarkers by:
a. Refining MR imaging analysis (including hippocampal volumetric assays, arterial spin labeling
(ASL), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques that may
distinguish participants with probable HS-Aging from those with positive AD biomarkers; b. Performing
proteomic discovery analysis in CSF to identify and evaluate potential HS-Aging biomarkers to
complement the A/T/N framework utilizing our prospective cohort with AÎ²(1-42), phospho-tau, and
neurodegeneration markers and MR imaging as a control cohort for AD. This specific aim will directly
test and enhance the clinical utility of the A/T/N framework for diagnosis of degenerative disease state;
and, c. Following our published and replicated neurocognitive testing marker that is associated with
HS-Aging pathology, we will optimize the clinical and neurocognitive criteria for disease diagnosis
based on the prospects of a relatively long-running (96 week) early-phase clinical trial."

Little is known about how bacteria prevalent in the digestive tract, most of which are anaerobes, take up and
process the hostâs dietary iron. How this activity influences the efficiency with which iron is absorbed by the
host is also unclear. Closing this gap in the knowledge is of both fundamental and biomedical interest. Iron-
deficiency and associated anemia are the most prevalent nutritional disorders worldwide, shared by nearly a
third of the human population. At the same time, unmetabolized heme iron from red meat diets that remains in
the colon has been associated with the development of diseases ranging from inflammation to colon cancer,
with microbial activity postulated to play a key role. The long-term goal of this work is to understand how
commensal bacteria commonly found in the healthy mammalian gut metabolize iron under the low/no
O2 conditions that are prevalent in this ecosystem. The proposed work focuses our groupâs knowledge and
infrastructure â accrued over 15 years of studying aerobic heme/iron biochemistry at the level of the catalyst,
cell, and ecosystem â on this ambitious long-term goal, which we have divided into two overlapping parts.
First, we will examine how common gut microbes, most of which are anaerobic, heme auxotrophic
bacteria (HAB), metabolize heme. We are focusing on three experimentally tractable HAB which are
abundant in humans and which either require heme for respiration (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron), are capable
of but not dependent on heme-mediated respiration (Lactobacillus rhamnosus), or are obligately fermentative
but still have limited uses for heme (Clostridium scindens). We will examine genes (via the generation of
knock-outs) and gene products that are predicted to play important roles in heme metabolism in these species,
but which belong to metabolic pathways that are typically incomplete. At the same time, we will employ
discovery-based approaches to identify members of the heme-proteome, using chemically defined growth
media, stable-isotope-labeled heme, and spectroscopic analyses with which we have a depth of expertise.
Second, we will define how gut bacterial species work together and with the animal host to metabolize
heme iron. As part of our experimental approach, we will use knock-out strains and isotopically labeled heme
to examine heme metabolism by co-cultures, using subsets of the three HAB above and a common enteric
heme heterotroph (Escherichia coli). Cocultures will be studied both in the flask and in mice with defined
(gnotobiotic) microbiomes, in collaboration with Prof. Seth Walk (MSU). Understanding anaerobic heme
metabolism by commensal bacteria serves the long-term biomedical goal of manipulating the microbiome to
facilitate host metabolism of iron, thereby remediating diseases associated with iron deficiency (anemia) or
excess (infection, colitis, inflammation, colon cancer)."

Background: Relatively few Veterans screening positive for hazardous drinking in primary care (PC) receive
alcohol care in the year following their alcohol screening. This suggests that existing VHA options for linking
Veterans in need of alcohol care, including those with comorbid hazardous drinking and PTSD and/or
depression (A-MH), are not effective. To that end, we have identified and propose to pilot test a promising
evidence-based intervention, Strengths-based Linkage to Alcohol Care (SLAC). SLAC has the potential to
increase linkage to alcohol care, as well as to improve drinking and mental health outcomes, among Veterans
with A-MH in PC.
Significance: Existing VHA options such as VHA-recommended brief alcohol counseling do not improve
linkage to alcohol care, suggesting a critical need for more intensive but practical efforts to link Veterans with
A-MH to care. This proposal directly addresses HSR&D priorities in the areas of Access to Care, Mental Health
(PTSD), and Primary Care by testing a novel approach (SLAC) to linking Veterans with A-MH to VA and non-
VA alcohol care and to improve their drinking and mental health outcomes.
Innovation and Impact: The proposed project is highly innovative because it offers a solution to the critical
gap in VHA care in which most Veterans in need of alcohol care do not receive it. It tests a strategy to increase
linkage to alcohol care that is both intensive enough to produce change, yet feasible to use in busy clinical
settings with too-high demand on too-few staff members. A highly innovative feature of SLAC is that it teaches
PC providers how to link Veterans with A-MH to alcohol care, which may help normalize conversations about
patientsâ alcohol use and their care options in PC as part of the provider role. PC providersâ lack of knowledge
on how to treat hazardous drinking is a substantial obstacle to Veterans receiving alcohol care. Additional
unique and innovative features of SLAC are that it uses patientsâ self-identified strengths, abilities, and skills to
help them link to an alcohol care option.
Specific Aims: Our two aims are (Aim 1): To adapt SLAC for use among Veterans with A-MH and for delivery
by telephone in the VHA PC setting. We will conduct qualitative interviews with Veterans, PC staff, and our
VACO operational partners to ensure that the content and format of SLAC are adapted so they are relevant
and acceptable to these stakeholders. (Aim 2): To determine (a) the feasibility of conducting a larger scale
randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test SLACâs effectiveness and (b) SLACâs acceptability among Veterans
with A-MH in PC, and to explore (c) the efficacy of SLAC in this Veteran population. To achieve Aim 2, we will
conduct a multi-site pilot RCT of SLAC at two VA medical facilities (Little Rock, AR and Palo Alto, CA). To
achieve Aims 2a-b, we will measure the feasibility (e.g., rates of enrollment and follow-up, fidelity to the SLAC
intervention) of conducting a subsequent larger RCT (to test SLACâs effectiveness) and SLACâs acceptability
(SLAC completion rates, satisfaction with SLAC) among Veterans. To achieve Aim 2c, we will explore the
efficacy of SLAC to improve Veteransâ linkage to and utilization of alcohol care, and their alcohol and mental
health outcomes, at 3-month follow-up.
Methodology: We will use (Aim 1) qualitative interviews to adapt SLAC for Veterans with A-MH and for PC,
and (Aim 2) conduct a multi-site, pilot RCT. Debriefing interviews with Veterans will follow the pilot RCT.
Next Steps/Implementation: Should our findings justify a subsequent project, we plan to propose a fully
powered, multi-site study, using a Hybrid design, to test SLACâs clinical effectiveness when delivered in VHA
PC while observing and gathering information on the implementation potential of SLAC in this setting. Our
operations partners are committed to implementing SLAC nationally should it be found to be effective."

 The visual system encodes visual stimuli in a temporally dynamic fashion, where certain aspects of a stimulus are
processed before others. A prime example of this trend is the spatial frequency (SF) tuning of individual neurons in the
primary visual cortex (V1). These cells are initially tuned to prefer coarse stimuli of lower SF; however, throughout their
brief responses their tuning profiles shift to preferring finer, high SF stimuli. This coarse-to-fine pattern of SF processing
has been found in mice, cats, non-human primates and humans, suggesting it may be a fundamental property of spatial
vision. Despite this, it is unclear whether this process develops postnatally in an experience-dependent fashion, like many
other aspects of spatial vision. Furthermore, the neural circuits and mechanisms underlying coarse-to-fine SF processing
are not well understood.
 To begin to understand the development of and neural circuitry behind coarse-to-fine SF processing, the investigator
will study this temporally dynamic process throughout development of the mouse primary visual system. First, the
investigator will characterize coarse-to-fine SF processing in V1 throughout early postnatal life and test the role of visual
experience in driving this development. This will be done by using multichannel extracellular recordings in mice at key
developmental ages as well as in dark-reared adult mice. Second, the extent to which coarse-to-fine SF processing is
cortically derived will be determined by recording from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and superior colliculus
(SC) of adult mice. The role of descending cortical feedback will also be tested by chemically silencing the cortex while
recording from these subcortical structures. Finally, the investigator will assess why cortical circuits develop coarse-to-fine
SF processing by determining if this temporally dynamic process enables the efficient coding of natural images.
Collectively, these results will provide novel and important information regarding the postnatal development of coarse-to-
fine SF processing throughout the primary visual pathway and will begin to unveil how this process relates to coding
complex natural images. Moreover, the research plan described within will provide the applicant with the additional
technical, conceptual, computational and scientific training needed to be a competitive, independent scientist. Finally, the
proposed research will take place in a stimulating scientific environment with all the resources required to see this project
to completion. This collaborative scientific community is strongly supportive of the proposed research and its success."

Cleft palate is one of the most common structural birth defects. Surgical correction and medical and psychosocial
care impose significant personal and societal burdens. Increased understanding of the etiology of cleft palate
potentially will lead to improvements in diagnosis and treatment. Palatogenesis is enormously complex. Paired
palatal shelves first extend vertically from the maxillary processes and must grow sufficiently so that upon
horizontal elevation their medial edges come into contact. Epithelia covering the medial shelves disintegrate,
allowing their fusion. Key processes involved include epithelial/mesenchymal interactions and transitions.
Studies in humans and mice have identified at least 429 genes associated with oral clefting. Reductionist
scientific approaches have provided detail about individual genes and pathways in palatogenesis, but the intuitive
models generated are not sufficient to represent the enormous complexity of the process. We will employ
transcriptome and network analyses to understand how biological components work together to produce system-
wide outcomes of epithelial differentiation and adhesion, mesenchymal biomechanical properties affecting
remodeling and shelf elevation, and anterior/posterior regionalization of epithelia and mesenchyme. These
processes require the integration of multiple cross-regulating signaling pathways. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)
and sonic hedgehog (SHH) are two such pathways, and their information is integrated with other pathways by
the transcription factor p63. We will generate bulk and single-cell RNA-seq libraries from the palatal shelves of
wild type mice to discover gene coexpression and regulatory networks, and specific cell populations involved in
normal palatogenesis. For bulk RNA-seq libraries we will separate anterior and posterior epithelial and
mesenchymal compartments allowing region-specific analysis of transcriptional changes. We will use the same
approach for four mutant mouse lines, exploiting these gene perturbations to identify key driver genes and
interacting pathways within these networks. We will study two activating FGFR2 mutations that exert their
differential effects from the epithelium or the mesenchyme (S252W or C342Y) and null mutations of SHH and
p63, expressed in the epithelium. Complementary bulk and single-cell RNA-seq libraries will identify differential
gene expression and novel key components and pathways critical to palatogenesis. We will use these datasets,
in conjunction with publicly available palate-related datasets to build high-resolution, multiscale molecular
networks that will be used to develop predictive, mechanistic models of palatogenesis. Novel molecular networks
and key regulators identified through the multiscale network modeling approach will be validated by in situ
hybridization, immunohistochemistry, palatal organ cultures, and mouse models. Our innovative approach to
generating comprehensive datasets, using advanced systems biology technologies, and building multiscale
network models of normal and abnormal palatogenesis will have a large impact on the clinical, craniofacial,
-omics, and developmental biology fields."
11031169,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Liver transplantation has failed to reach its full potential for saving lives due to the inadequate organ supply.
Every year thousands of potentially salvageable patients die awaiting an allograft, hundreds of others receive a
`marginalâ donor organ, often in desperate circumstances, and a many times this number of potential recipients
are never offered listing for lifesaving organs due to the need to ration this precious but limited resource. Liver
xenotransplantation offers a potential solution to the organ shortage but clinical application has been stymied
by four principle hurdles: 1) risk of zoonotic infection of humans, 2) the vigorous immune response mounted to
xenogeneic tissues, and 3) physiologic incompatibilities due to species divergence arising in a rarity of protein:
protein interactions, and if these obstacles can be consistently overcome, the 4) need to identify a clinically
applicable IS regimen.
A new tool with unprecedented potential to address these barriers to widespread application of
xenotransplantation is found in technology such as CRISPR-Cas9 that dramatically increases gene editing
specificity and efficiency. A powerful example is found in recent work by our industry partner, eGenesis, who
used CRISPR-Cas9 to rid the pig genome of 62 copies of functional porcine endogenous retroviruses
(PERVs), essentially eliminating the risk of PERV transmission to an organ recipient. In the current proposal,
we explore the ability of advanced gene editing to address immunologic and physiologic barriers that cause
immediate graft dysfunction of liver xenografts when transplanted into a translational baboon model.
With the general goal preventing initial xenograft dysfunction (IXD) to gain long term survival of pig liver
xenografts in baboon recipients, studies in Aim I will focus on two recently identified potential impediments to
xenograft survival: 1) ischemia reperfusion injury, and 2) platelet consumption. Recent findings in cardiac
xenotransplantation studies have exposed the critical contribution of IR injury to early heart xenograft demise.
Our wealth of experience with ex vivo liver perfusion and also xeno liver perfusion with human blood and the
recently reported technique for ischemia free liver transplants should yield a definitive answer to this question.
Aim II will focus on understanding the impact of gene edits that: 1) eliminate expression of the three major
antibody targets of preformed human anti-pig antibodies, 2) gain expression of human proteins designed to
address complement and coagulation dysregulation occurring with porcine liver xenotransplants in NHP, and
3) mitigate innate and cell-mediated immunity and inflammation. To accomplish this, we will take advantage of
liver transplant, ex vivo liver perfusion with human blood and in vitro assays well established in our lab and a
panel of CRISPR modified pigs with varied expression of genetic edits."

Trauma and other surgically treated conditions are a crippling, unaddressed burden of disease that
disproportionately impacts sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) globally. The Data Science Center for the Study of
Surgery, Injury, and Equity in Africa (D-SINE-Africa) is a strategic partnership between the University of Buea
(Buea), the University of California (Los Angeles (UCLA) and Berkeley), the Cameroonian Ministry of Public
Health, the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Cameroon, and the University of Cape Town in South
Africa. D-SINE Africa will address the intersection of health disparities with the risk factors and outcomes
associated with injury and surgical disease in SSA. Although more abundant than ever, data is still a limited
resource in low- and middle-income countries. Our approach views âbig dataâ available in SSA as an
opportunity to develop sustainable data-constrained approaches appropriate for resource-constrained settings.
Thus, data science will be harnessed to address our Hub's two main goals which are;1) to decrease the
burden of injuries and surgical diseases through improved surveillance, prevention, and treatment; and 2) to
improve access to quality surgical care in Cameroon and other SSA countries. These goals will be achieved
through three specific aims: 1) Research 2) Networking and 3) Capacity Building. These aims implemented
through three cores (Administrative, Data Management and Analysis, and Capacity Building Cores) and two
Research Projects that will be conducted in Cameroon, South Africa, and Uganda. Research Project 1 - Health
Equity Surveillance addresses the urgent gap in rapid socioeconomic (SES) estimation necessary to track
health equity in acute care settings by applying a clustering algorithm to existing publicly available
Demographic and Health Surveys data sets for SSA. Research Project 2 â Trauma Follow Up Prediction aims
to improve trauma outcomes by using machine learning to optimize a mobile phone-based screening survey
that will identify which trauma patients would benefit from further care after they are discharged from the
hospital, again using a data reduction âbig data to small dataâ approach in line with the Hub's commitment to
sustainable data use practices. These projects utilize common data sources (Cameroon Trauma Registry),
have harmonizing themes (injury, equity, and data reduction), and will yield findings that can be used together
(e.g., identification of SES groups vulnerable to poor follow up care). The Hub has innovatively built community
engagement vehicles into the Internal Advisory Board to promote a multi-faceted approach to building trust
with research participants and end-users. D-SINE Africa efforts will drive innovation and impact in data
science, injury, and equity research to improve access to surgical disease prevention and care, including those
whose SES conspires to increase their vulnerability to injury and surgical conditions while reducing consistent
surgical care access. D-SINE Africa's strategic partners joint infrastructure are available for use by its
members and DSI-Africa consortium at large."

 Prostate cancer progression to metastatic castration-resistant disease continues to represent a major
health issue. Recent advances in single-cell approaches have revealed extensive heterogeneity and complexity
of cell states and cell types that drive tumor progression, and additional studies have demonstrated the central
role of the tumor microenvironment. Consequently, we are proposing a new Program Project to investigate the
interplay between tumor cells and their surrounding stromal and immune microenvironment in promoting prostate
cancer progression, metastasis, and treatment-resistance. Our proposal is highly integrated as it brings together
a multi-institutional team of four distinguished investigators (Michael Shen, Charles Sawyers, Cory Abate-Shen,
Massimo Loda) in the study of prostate cancer who have complementary expertise as well as a substantial track
record of collaborative interactions.
 We have structured our application around the following projects and cores: Project 1, led by Charles
Sawyers (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center), will investigate the immune and stromal factors that
promote prostate adenocarcinoma and castration-response. Project 2, led by Cory Abate-Shen (Columbia
University Irving Medical Center; CUIMC), will investigate the cell intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of prostate cancer
metastasis to bone. Project 3, led by Michael Shen (CUIMC), who is also overall PI, will analyze the intrinsic
and extrinsic factors that promote prostate neuroendocrine differentiation. Core A (Pathobiology), led by
Massimo Loda (Weill Cornell Medicine), will provide multiple pathology-based services to all three Projects.
Finally, Core B (Administrative and Data Management), led by Michael Shen, will support each Project through
data management, biostatistical support, and coordination of the overall program, resource management, and
review by the Internal and External Advisory Boards. Together, this highly synergistic program will elucidate the
integration of intrinsic and extrinsic signals that drive castration-resistance, metastatic tropism, and
neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer, and will provide translational insights into the stromal and
immune microenvironments for improved therapeutic approaches."

HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) is the sole target for development of antibody-mediated immune response. Studies of patients infected with HIV have led to the isolation of antibodies against different epitopes on the Env surface, capable of neutralizing a broad range of circulating HIV strains and providing passive protection against repeated viral challenges in non-human primates (NHPs). The current goal of HIV vaccine research is to create immunogens capable of eliciting similar antibody responses in naÃ¯ve individuals. Structure- based engineering of the soluble ectodomain of Env trimer is in the core of most of the current approaches. One major complicating factor with this approach comes from the large antigenic surface on the Env, where many off-target and competing epitopes are available to the immune system. The induction of immune responses against âdistractingâ epitopes leads to attenuated and inconsistent response against the targeted bnAb epitopes of interest. NHPs are an important model for this work, because wildtype mice do not make Ab responses to major Env nAb epitopes observed in humans. Analysis of the polyclonal Ab response in NHP immunizations where soluble Env ectodomain trimers were used, revealed a set of highly immunogenic epitopes with low potential for the development of protective heterologous, and in some cases even autologous, responses. These epitopes include the base of the Env trimer ectodomain, N241/N289 glycan hole and variable loops (V1-V5). To address this shortcoming we have developed a rational approach to consistently elicit antibodies against the conserved fusion peptide (FP) epitope, for which there are several examples of human bnAbs. We have used our designer trimers and continuous antigen release program to generate preliminary results verifying success of this concept in NHPs. The reproducibility of the epitope targeting is the most impressive preliminary result presented here, and it indicates that reproducible elicitation of FP nAbs in humans may be readily achievable. Here we propose to conduct a series of experiments designed to further optimize this immunization strategy by minimizing the accessibility of immuno-distracting, off-target epitopes, and ultimately verify if protective, FP-targeting, bnAbs can be reproducibly elicited in NHPs. We intend to also immunize some animals in parallel with a SARS-CoV2 RBD immunogen we have designed. The RBD immunizations will be at a different site (deltoid) and will not interfere with the Env fusion peptide targeted immunizations. This dual use immunization approach is generally valuable for future HIV vaccine studies, and we will perform a pilot study to show this type of dual use immunization strategy is informative, which will be of value to use in our future HIV vaccine studies. The SARS-CoV2 RBD will also serve as a negative control for immunological parameters compared to the HIV candidate vaccine, which is of additional value. We will also incorporate our immunogens into multi-valent nanoparticles to improve immunogen trafficking, enhance B cell receptor avidity, and block the non-productive but highly immunogenic base epitope. Further, we will use continuous antigen delivery to improve the duration of germinal center reactions, and ultimately drive the high levels of somatic hypermutation necessary for generating bnAbs capable of neutralizing a wide diversity of HIV strains. This project will culminate by testing the efficacy of our vaccine regimen by challenging immunized NHPs with heterologous low dose repeated challenge."

 Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder affecting 1 in 54 U.S. children.
Co-occurring anxiety affects 40 to 50% of children with ASD, causing substantial distress and impairment.
Treatment of anxiety is a high priority for parents of children with ASD, and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)
modified for ASD has demonstrated efficacy relative to standard care CBT and usual care. However, existing
protocols have been established for academic medical settings with limited stakeholder input and
correspondingly diminished potential for real-world uptake in community-based clinics. Accordingly, we propose
a study in which stakeholders from both rural and urban communities are fully engaged to develop a CBT
intervention and associated clinician training protocol - Community-based Anxiety Program Tailored for Autism
(CAPTA) - that is able to be readily employed in community mental health settings. We will then preliminarily
evaluate treatment response and mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will conduct a needs assessment with parents of
youth with ASD and co-occurring anxiety, community mental health clinicians, and community mental health
clinic leaders; we will also consult with an Advisory Board of experts in CBT for co-occurring anxiety in youth
with ASD and individuals with lived experience (i.e., parents and self-advocates). This feedback from
stakeholders and experts will directly inform adaptations to CAPTA. We will then conduct a small open trial
(N=10) with the goal of obtaining real-world experience and refining the treatment and measurement protocols.
Aim 2 involves a pilot randomized controlled trial in which CAPTA is compared to usual care in two different
community-based mental health centers (N=60). We will examine CAPTAâs preliminary effectiveness to improve
anxiety symptom severity and impairment, and we will also explore theoretically oriented treatment mechanisms.
Aim 3 focuses on implementation outcomes (fidelity, feasibility, acceptability) and contextual factors influencing
CAPTA implementation and sustainment. The proposed project is well-aligned with recommendations from the
Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee to scale up and implement evidence-based interventions in
community settings, expand the services workforce, and accelerate the pipeline from research to practice.
Specifically, this pilot study will establish the feasibility and acceptability of transporting CBT for youth with ASD
and co-occurring anxiety to community mental health clinics before progressing to a larger hybrid effectiveness-
implementation trial in an R01."

Promoting health-enhancing and sustainable physical activity levels across childhood and adolescence
contributes to adult health. Health disparities are present in ethnic minority children and are linked to physical
inactivity. The Childrenâs Health Activity Motor Program (CHAMP) is an evidence-based intervention that
demonstrates impactful results on motor performance, perceived motor competence, and physical activity in
physical education and movement-based settings. Currently, 10 million children participate in afterschool
programs (ASPs) each day, and ASPs provide a great opportunity to enhance childrenâs health outside of the
regular school environment, particularly given the decline in physical education. This proposed randomized
cluster, controlled trial will examine the immediate (pre- to post-test) and sustained (1-year post-intervention
follow-up) effects of CHAMP-ASP on physical activity (primary outcome), motor performance, perceived motor
competence, health-related physical fitness, and weight status. CHAMP-ASP will be implemented by ASP staff
and will be conducted in ASPs located in Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. The ASPs will include a high minority
population. Children (N = 264; CHAMP-ASP=132 and control=132) K-2 graders (typically ages 5-8 years) will
participate 35 minutes/day X 3 days/week for 19 weeks (dose of 1995 minutes). The aims are to: a) examine
the immediate and sustained effects of CHAMP-ASP on physical activity, motor performance, and perceived
motor competence relative to the control ASP, b) examine the immediate and sustained effects of CHAMP-
ASP on secondary health outcomes - health-related physical fitness (cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular
strength), and weight status compared to children in schools randomized to control ASP, and c) determine if
perceived motor competence mediates the effect of CHAMP-ASP on moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.
The long-term goal is to provide a sustainable, ecologically-relevant, and evidence-based program during the
early elementary years that is health-enhancing and increases physical activity in the ethnic minority
population. Findings could significantly influence future physical activity interventions and support a
sustainable, ecologically-relevant (delivered by ASP staff) evidence-based program (i.e., CHAMP) that
contributes to long-term health-enhancing physical activity and health in children."
10816373,"Abstract
 Understanding the cellular events underlying ovulation and subsequent corpus luteum (CL) formation is
critically important because these biological processes provide the foundation of our ability to regulate female
fertility. A fundamental cornerstone of the cellular events induced by the preovulatory gonadotropin surge vital
for ovulation and CL formation is the expression of specific transcription factors. However, our knowledge of
the identity and regulatory actions of gonadotropin-induced key transcription factors remains limited.
 A recent study has shed light on a member of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor family, FOS
(a.k.a. c-fos), as a key transcription factor involved in follicular development, ovulation, and luteal formation.
Fos-deficient mice failed to ovulate and form CL even when exogenous gonadotropins were administered (1),
indicating that the ovarian expression of Fos is necessary for normal ovulation and luteinization. However, little
to nothing is known exactly how the FOS/AP-1 transcription factor affects these processes in the ovary. Our
preliminary study revealed for the first time that the expression of FOS is highly up-regulated in dominant
follicles collected after hCG administration from normally cycling women and in preovulatory follicles after hCG
administration in mice. Moreover, we demonstrated that FOS regulated the hCG-induced increase in the
expression of key ovulatory genes in human granulosa cells by directly binding to the promoters of these
genes. Based on these novel findings, we hypothesized that FOS/AP-1 plays essential roles in ovulation and
luteal formation/function both in humans and mice.
 Fos null mice displayed a pleiotropic phenotype with significant loss of viability at birth. To determine the
ovary-specific function/action of FOS/AP-1, we propose to establish novel transgenic mouse models in which
Fos expression is ablated in an ovarian cell-specific manner. These mutant mice will be used to assess the
ovarian phenotype including follicular development, ovulation, luteal development, and fertility as well as to
identify downstream target genes of FOS/AP-1 in ovarian cells (Specific Aim #1). To relate and compare the
findings from mice to humans, we will first characterize the spatiotemporally regulated expression of all FOS
and JUN family members in ovulatory follicles obtained before and throughout the periovulatory period from
normally cycling women. The specific role of FOS/AP-1 in human ovaries will also be determined by identifying
downstream target genes of FOS/AP-1 and assessing the cellular impact(s) of FOS' action (Specific Aim #2).
 The information obtained from the proposed studies will not only advance our understanding of the
mechanism necessary for successful ovulation and luteinization but also be instrumental for future
translational/clinical application, thus leading to improved management of fertility in vivo and in vitro."
10748304,"There is a broad heterogeneity of clinical outcomes after infection with Coccidioides (Cocci) ranging from
asymptomatic infection to mild pulmonary disease (âValley feverâ) to a life-threatening, invasive disease called
disseminated coccidioidomycosis (DCM). Everyone in the endemic areas is susceptible to this infection, but we
have almost no ability to predict who will develop disseminated disease and lack an understanding of why they
do so. With nearly 10K reported cases of Valley fever and 200 cases of DCM yearly in California, our state alone
spends ~$1B yearly on coccidioidomycosis. Thus, there is an urgent need to better understand DCM to enable
better prevention, diagnostics, prognostics, and treatments. Our team's long-term goal is to study the
intersection between the virulence programs of Coccidioides spp that maliciously exploit defective immunity, and
the dysregulation of genetic and immunological programs of innate and adaptive immunity that allow for severe
disease to take hold.
 Our program will bring together a cohesive and multi-disciplinary team of immunologists, geneticists,
computational biologists, fungal microbiologists, and clinicians. Combining deep expertise with synergistic goals
will enable breakthroughs.
 Our consortium includes four Projects and three supporting Cores: Project 1 addresses the innate immune
responses to cocci infection that go awry in the first stages of cocci infection; Project 2 addresses the adaptive
immune responses to cocci infection that go awry in protecting the host from disseminated disease; Project 3
addresses the genomic basis of cocci disease, from common variants that underlie susceptibility due to ancestry
to rare variants that disable host defenses; and Project 4 addresses the contributions of fungal virulence factors
in enabling the organisms to evade host immune defenses in some individuals. Our program includes an
Administrative Core (Core A) that facilitates communications between investigators, organizes meetings and
finances, and runs the Developmental Research Program. We also propose a unified Clinical Samples Core
(Core B) comprising two of the largest coccidioidomycosis clinics in California, and a Model Organisms Core
(Core C) that will carry out all experiments requiring BSL3 safety measures. These Cores together empower the
proposed projects by providing common reagents, human samples, tools, and expertise.
 Our proposed investigations have the potential to transform our understanding of invasive fungal infections
and will restore hope for patients through new approaches to prevent, diagnose, and treat DCM."

Residency (CARiNG-StARR) Program is to train physician-scientists in biomedical research to cultivate
investigators who will lead the development, implementation, and evaluation of new translational and clinical
modalities to address ADRD. CARiNG-StARR will train resident-investigators across three clinical disciplines:
Family Medicine, Psychiatry, and Neurology focusing on three areas: 1) novel links and prevention
strategies 2) comorbidities and care models, and 3) ADRD-related health disparities. The program will consist
of four training components: 1) comprehensive didactics covering basic, translational, and clinical research and
professional development with emphasis placed on research in ADRD; 2) development and completion of an
ADRD research project and an individualized career development plan; 3) a record of accomplishment of
scholarly activity in the field of ADRD; and 4) eligibility for board certification in Family Medicine, Psychiatry, or
Neurology, and continuation of clinical and research training in a sub-specialty or fellowship. CARiNG-StARR
will be led by an Executive Committee (EC) of MPIs Anthony Viera, MD, MPH (Family Medicine) and Heather
Whitson, MD, MHS (Duke Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development), and a CARiNG-StARR
Associate Program Director from the Office of Physician-Scientist Development, along with an Expanded EC of
Residency Program Directors and a Program Coordinator, capitalizing on a robust array of resources and a
team of 42 multi-disciplinary, well-funded, and experienced faculty preceptors/mentors working in
ADRD and relevant fields. This application requests support for three resident-Investigators each year with
each trainee supported for 12-months of research during the duration of their residency. Upon completion,
these individuals will be prepared for further training in a research-intense fellowship, competing for extramural
funding, and becoming the next generation of physician-scientists leading and mentoring trainees in clinically-
oriented research focusing on ADRD. Achievement of the program's objectives will fulfill urgent needs for: 1)
more full-time academic physician-scientists and mentors in medical schools throughout the country and 2)
innovations and clinical translation of novel strategies to improve the health and care of people with ADRD."
10589059,"Perinatal arterial stroke (PAS) includes infants with neonatal arterial ischemic stroke and presumed
perinatal arterial stroke and has an estimated incidence of 1 in 1150. The majority will develop hemiparesis,
often resulting in lifelong and debilitating disability, including lowered cognition and quality of life. There are no
evidence-based forms of rehabilitation designated as standard-of-care for these infants.
 We propose a Phase III trial to address this lack of evidence-based treatments. The I-ACQUIRE Trial is a
rigorous, adequately powered, multi-site randomized controlled trial comparing 2 dosages of a pediatric
rehabilitation - known as Infant ACQUIRE - to Usual and Customary treatment (U&CT). Prior studies of I-
ACQUIRE show high safety, patient acceptability, and evidence of significant and enduring benefits. Briefly, I-
ACQUIRE will be used to treat 8 â 24 mth old infants with PAS in either 3 hrs/day (Moderate Dose) or 6
hrs/day (High Dose), for 5 days/wk for 4 wks. Treatment occurs in a home or natural setting where operant
conditioning techniques are applied to achieve goals paced for each infant. I-ACQUIRE includes the core
features of pediatric Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT). Standardized treatment at all sites is
monitored weekly via a Fidelity of CIMT Implementation tool. Clinical Trial Design: 240 infants (N=80/group)
will be randomly assigned to: 1) Moderate Dose I-ACQUIRE, 2) High Dose I-ACQUIRE, or 3) U&CT. (N=80).
Double-blinded assessments occur at baseline, end of 4 wks of treatment, and 6 mos post-treatment. A Parent
Council will be active throughout the trial, supporting NIH's goal of increased stakeholder engagement in
clinical trials.
 The specific aims are: 1) Primary: Determine the efficacy of I-ACQUIRE at 2 dosage levels compared to
U&CT to increase upper extremity skills on the hemiparetic side (using a minimal clinically meaningful
threshold that is achieved at end of treatment and 6 mos later); 2) Secondary: Determine the efficacy of I-
ACQUIRE at 2 dosage levels compared to U&CT to improve use of the hemiparetic upper extremity as an
âassisting handâ in bimanual activities; and 3) Exploratory: Explore the association between I-ACQUIRE
treatment at Moderate and/or High Doses and the infant's gross motor development and cognition (i.e.,
potential cross-domain effects of treatment). The Statistical Analysis Plan controls for multiple comparisons;
after testing the major study hypotheses, sensitivity analyses will consider factors that may contribute to
variation in treatment outcomes.
 Public Health Impact: Each year, an estimated 3400+ infants in the U.S. have PAS with high likelihood of
lifelong impairment in neuromotor and often cognitive functioning resulting in a high cost burden for families,
the healthcare system, and society. If I-ACQUIRE proves efficacious, then the field will have the critically
needed Phase III confirmatory evidence and the specific clinical protocol needed to transform rehabilitation and
improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for infants with PAS."
10823679,"Liver fibrosis is the consequence of chronic liver diseases, such as hepatitis B and C infection and alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Cirrhosis is the end stage of liver fibrosis and is associated with life-threatening complications, including liver failure, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The progression of liver fibrosis leads to the formation of bridging fibrosis, resulting in the development of cirrhosis. The molecular mechanism of the progression of liver fibrosis is not fully understood. In this project, we focus on the mechanism of HSC invasion and ECM remodeling, which is required for extending fibrosis bands to form bridging fibrosis. Our preliminary data show that Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) is one of the most enriched transcription factors in HSCs that have invaded/migrated. WT1 inhibition reduced HSC invasion, extracellular matrix (ECM) production, and the development of liver fibrosis in mice. We also found that the WT1 promoter region contains hypoxia-inducing factor (HIF)-binding elements and WT1 is one of the most enriched transcription factors in HSCs under hypoxic challenge. Based on these preliminary data, the proposed study will investigate the mechanism of WT1-mediated HSC invasion, ECM remodeling, and the development of liver fibrosis. We hypothesize that the fibrosis-mediated hypoxic environment upregulates WT1 expression in HSCs. This promotes HSC invasion, ECM production and remodeling, promoting the development of liver fibrosis. Aim 1 will investigate the mechanism of WT1-mediated HSC invasion and pro-fibrogenic role of WT1 expression in HSCs in liver fibrosis using HSC-specific Wt1 knockout mice. Analysis of bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing and digital spatial profiling of whole transcriptomic profiles will identify the role of WT1 in the induction of HSC populations associated with ECM production and HSC migration and invasion. Because the WT1 promoter region contains multiple HIF-binding elements, Aim 2 will investigate the mechanisms of hypoxia and HIF-1-mediated WT1 induction in HSCs. Aim 3 will examine the role of the WT1 downstream effector Cathepsin K in HSC invasion, ECM digestion and remodeling. We will also test the hypothesis that Cathepsin K can be a therapeutic target for ongoing and progressive liver fibrosis. We will also examine the expression of WT1 and its downstream effectors in human liver specimens. Our results will identify a new mechanism for HSC biology, including HSC invasion, WT1 induction, ECM remodeling, and the development of liver fibrosis."
10814191,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
In the development and progression of cancer, cells frequently delete large regions of DNA that include tumor
suppressor genes (TSGs). By virtue of proximity, genes that neighbor TSGs are often co-deleted, which
usually does not affect cell fitness. Nonetheless, deletion of a gene as a passenger mutation can make a
cancer cell vulnerable to drugs or other mutations in ways that healthy, genetically ânormalâ cells are not.
Targeting such vulnerabilities to kill cancer cells and leave healthy cells unharmed evokes the genetic principle
of âsynthetic lethality.â Two mutations are said to be synthetic lethal when cells tolerate either one individually,
but die when they occur together. Thus, identification of genes that are synthetic lethal with co-deleted genes
can provide new drug targets.
 One of the most frequently deleted tumor suppressor genes in cancer is PTEN, which encodes a
phosphatase that normally antagonizes cell growth and survival. Only 40 kilobases upstream of the human
PTEN locus on chromosome 10q23 is the locus for ATAD1, which encodes an evolutionarily conserved
ATPase that is essential for mitochondrial homeostasis. ATAD1 extracts tail-anchored (TA) proteins from the
outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). TA proteins possess a single-pass transmembrane domain at the C-
terminus. We conducted a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genes that are essential only in the
absence of ATAD1, as these would make ideal drug targets for tumors that co-delete ATAD1 with PTEN.
Multiple hits from our screen implicate ATAD1 in the regulation of apoptosis, a process that critically depends
on TA proteins in the OMM. Specifically, translocation to the OMM by a class of TA proteins known as BH3-
only proteins is thought to induce apoptosis. We hypothesize that ATAD1 extracts tail-anchored BH3-only
proteins from the outer mitochondrial membrane to prevent aberrant apoptosis. The present proposal
describes how we will test this hypothesis using genetics, biochemistry, and animal models. Small molecule
mimetics of BH3-only proteins are approved for use in cancer patients, and thus the connection between
ATAD1 and apoptosis could have major implications for precision oncology.

10908251,"Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) accounts for ten percent of all lymphomas in the western world and remains a
substantial clinical problem. Relapsed and refractory (R/R) HL presents a particularly critical unmet clinical
need because approximately 25% of HL patients will be refractory to the standard of care or will relapse while
receiving treatment, and the overall survival of R/R HL patients is ~50%. New targeted treatment options and
improved risk assessment are needed to improve the therapeutic options for these patients. HL is defined by a
rare malignant B cell (Hodgkin-Reed-Sternberg , HRS cells) that occupies a small fraction of the tumor
microenvironment. Despite many advances in next generation sequencing technologies, the identification of
somatic variants in cancers characterized by rare cell populations remains technically and analytically
challenging. These obstacles have resulted in a limited number of studies that have used high throughput
genome-wide technologies to characterize the genomic landscape of newly diagnosed HL, and far fewer have
attempted to use these technologies to address the genomic landscape of R/R HL. Here, we address this
shortfall by asking three questions: 1) Can ultra-deep genome-wide sequencing, paired with analysis and
filtering strategies optimized for low VAF variants identify somatic variants driving treatment resistance in R/R
HL? 2) Can we use somatic mutation status in a large cohort of newly diagnosed and R/R HL to identify genes
that are predictive of response to therapy? 3) Can somatic mutations identified in genomic and/or cell free
DNA describe clonal heterogeneity among HRS cells and can cell free DNA serve as biomarker of HL at
diagnosis or relapse? This research will be broadly impactful because: 1) it will describe the genomic
landscape of R/R HL and will identify biomarkers that are predictive of poor response to treatment; 2) it will
begin to address the relationship between clonal architecture in HL, disease outcome, and prognosis; 3) it will
further define cfDNA as a suitable target for HL disease monitoring
By completing this proposal Dr. Felicia Gomez will gain advanced training in genomics, bioinformatics,
lymphoma biology, and cancer biology in general. This proposal takes advantage of the cutting edge genomics
and cancer research at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM is an ideal location to
complete the experiments and training described in this proposal. Dr. Gomez is a well-trained scholar who is
poised to develop a program of research that will be innovative and responsive to the need for diversity in the
biomedical workforce. When Dr. Gomez transitions to independence she will continue to focus on cancer
genomics and will broaden her research to address the interactions between somatic and germline variation
and how this interaction affects the development and progression of lymphoma and other malignancies."
11043962,"The advent of antiviral therapy (ART) revealed a treatment-resistant reservoir in CD4+ T cells
capable of refueling HIV viremia when ART is stopped. This reservoir is a major barrier to
achieving a cure for HIV infection. Our recent work suggests the inherent reservoir decay is
more rapid than previously recognized. This decay is obscured due to an opposing force that
results in proviral clonal expansion. The driving forces behind proviral clonal expansion remain
mysterious, but integration into introns of oncogenes may play a role. Overall objective: In this
proposal, we dissect the drivers of reservoir contraction (Aim 1) and expansion (Aim 2). Our
approach will be to perturb both forces and to study the resulting effects. We will use proviral,
integration site, and RNA sequencing to understand how perturbing these forces affects the
genetic make-up of proviruses, their propensity to expand, and their expression. Our approach
is to perform massive deep sequencing in a few individuals rather than large sample size. We
believe our intriguing results validate our deliberate decision to limit sample size to obtain
deeper sequence information within each individual. With this approach, we recently provided
unprecedented depth and elucidated previously unknown selection pressures. Design and
Methods: In Aim 1, we isolate the role of immune clearance by measuring reservoir contraction
in vivo and in vitro. We also dissect the cytotoxicity induced by HIV proteins by mutating
individuals Open Reading Frames before infecting CD4 T cells with a barcoded virus. In Aim 2,
we dissect the drivers of clonal expansion, including HIV-driven cell division, by using a
barcoded virus. We also use longitudinal integration site analysis to compare the rate of clonal
expansion as well as the âcharacterâ of the expanded proviral clones in elite controllers, acutely
and chronically infected individuals on ART.
The premise of our proposal is largely based on our work showing that there are two
counterbalancing forces that cause (1) proviral contraction through viral cytotoxicity and immune
clearance and (2) proviral expansion through clonal proliferation. The significance of our
proposal includes that it may contribute to growing evidence that the reservoir is more visible
than previously realized. We envision this work could lead to approaches that enhance immune
clearance or target splicing to reduce reservoir size."
10794924,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The World Health Organization warns of a pending public health emergency caused by mosquito-borne
zoonotic pathogen Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). The consequences of this emerging virus could be
exacerbated by insufficient vaccines for prevention of infection and disease. RVF is an important
agroeconomic illness of domesticated livestock and is endemic in Africa and parts of the Middle East. Further
spread is likely given that mosquito species capable of transmitting RVFV are found in Europe and the
Americas. The most striking feature of RVF disease in sheep is a wave of fetal loss (known as an âabortion
stormâ) that sweeps through herds of pregnant animals, where spontaneous abortion rates can reach as high
as 90%. Vaccination of livestock protects animals while simultaneously reducing the spread of RVFV to
people. Obstacles in the successful development of RVFV livestock vaccines include: 1) vaccine strains often
cause fetal infection and death in pregnant animals, and 2) vaccines that protect adult animals from disease
are not always effective at preventing vertical transmission during pregnancy. These hurdles represent a major
gap in the vaccine development field. The mechanisms by which live-attenuated vaccine strains of RVFV are
vertically transmitted in utero, as well as the maternal immune response required for the protection of
developing fetuses, are not known. No systematic evaluation of the vertical transmission potential of clinically-
relevant live attenuated vaccines has been performed. To address this gap in the field, we propose to use an
experimental rodent model of RVFV vertical transmission and fetal death in late-gestation pregnant rats. RVFV
directly infects the placenta in rats, causes hemorrhage and inflammation, and results in fetal malformations
including intrauterine fetal death even in pregnant dams without signs of disease. This proposal will use the
pregnant rat model to test current RVF vaccine candidates for the mechanism(s) of vertical transmission, fetal
protection, and identification of maternal immune correlates of fetal protection. We will also conduct a
comparative analysis of virulent and attenuated RVFV strains for permissivity of placental explants from
relevant species to identify cellular and structural targets of infection. Our overall hypothesis is that infection of
pregnant rats with RVFV live-attenuated vaccines will provide pre-clinical quantitative data on vaccine safety
for developing fetuses, efficacy for the fetuses, and critical maternal correlates of fetal protection. Completion
of these studies will change the paradigm of RVFV vaccine development by providing, for the first time, a
mechanistic explanation for the vertical transmission potential of clinically relevant LAVs."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Diseases leading to antigen persistence as in chronic viral infection and cancer induce development of
exhausted T cells (Texs) that have defective effector function. While Texs represent an altered state of
differentiation in which cells become addicted to antigen for their survival, their functions can be reinvigorated
after inhibitory checkpoint blockade, leading to antigen control in murine, primate, and cancer patients. While
only a small subset of patients responds to checkpoint blockade, many have severe toxicities especially with
checkpoint combination therapy. The fact that clinicians expect most patients to be non-responsive to current
immunotherapies highlights the pressing need to identify, develop, and improve treatments that are efficient
and safe for patients that presently have no treatment options. Our discovery that chronically infected PSGL-1
(P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1)-deficient mice mounted a robust anti-viral T cell response that supported viral
clearance and was linked to downregulation of multiple inhibitory receptors demonstrates that PSGL-1
represents a new target for immune modulation. Our conclusion is underscored by our finding of enhanced
anti-tumor T cell responses in PSGL-1-deficient mice leading to PD-1 downregulation and tumor control in a
melanoma model. Our findings identified PSGL-1 as a new inhibitory checkpoint that promotes the
development of Texs during chronic viral infection and cancer. Our overall objective in this proposal is to
determine how and when PSGL-1 signaling inhibits T cells during chronic antigen stimulation. Our central
hypothesis is that PSGL-1 signaling modulates inhibitory mechanisms not only in T cells but also in other
immune cells that contribute to T cell exhaustion. The rationale is that once we fully understand this pathway,
we can develop effective therapeutics targeting PSGL-1 to reinvigorate Texs. The proposed research will
provide a mechanistic analysis of when, where, and how the PSGL-1 inhibitory signaling pathway mediates
Texs development. We will test our hypothesis by pursuing the following three specific aims 1) To determine
the cellular and temporal requirement for PSGL-1 mediated T cell exhaustion 2) To determine the therapeutic
potential of relieving PSGL-1 inhibition and 3) To identify molecular mechanisms by which PSGL-1 mediates
inhibitory pathways in T cells. This contribution will be significant because understanding how this inhibitory
checkpoint axis fundamentally functions has the potential to lead to the development of new therapeutic
interventions targeting a new class of inhibitory receptors to modulate immune responses and help prevent and
treat a wide range of diseases. Our studies are innovative as they may expand the development of a new class
of drugs targeting adhesion receptor inhibitory pathways to reverse T cell exhaustion. Understanding the
mechanisms by which PSGL-1 mediates inhibitory signals is anticipated to help develop new therapies for
diseases mediated by immune cell dysfunction.

10771091,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The recent opioid crisis across the United States has drawn national attention and resulted in the allocation of
significant federal resources to substance use treatment and prevention efforts. American Indian (AI)
communities, however, have faced a substance use crisis of similar scope for many years, without the benefit
of proportionate attention and resources. Disparities in substance use disorder impacting AI populations are
well-documented, and the roots of these disparities can be traced to significantly higher adolescent substance
use among AIs compared to other ethnic groups in the U.S. AI youth report earlier initiation of substance use
than their non AI peers. National trends of escalating opioid use are evident among AI populations as well, and
appear, in fact, to be even more pronounced, reflecting the overall pattern of disparities observed across
substances, with AI youth reporting greater heroin and OxyContin use than youth from other racial and ethnic
groups. The imperative remains strong to direct attention and resources to focus on early prevention efforts for
AI youth. In response to this need, researchers at the Centers for American Indian and Alaska Native Health in
the Colorado School of Public Health at the University of Colorado have recently completed an intensive
community-engaged process to rigorously adapt the Strengthening Families Program for Parents and Youth
10-14 for the cultural context of a Northern Plains AI community, creating a program optimized for AI families,
ThiwÃ¡he GluwÃ¡Å¡'akapi (TG, sacred home in which family is made strong). The current study will test the
effectiveness of TG for delaying the onset of substance use among young adolescents. Based on evidence
that the original Strengthening Families program may impact risk behaviors beyond substance use, and in
response to requests from participating families and community partners to help address suicide risk among
their youth, the current study will also test the impact of TG on suicidal ideation among youth. In addition, in
recognition of the potential of for the TG program to have a reciprocal influence on the adults participating in
the program with their children, capitalizing on parents' motivation to protect their youth and make concomitant
positive changes in their own lives, the current study will examine effects on adult substance use as well.
Examining effects on adult substance use is especially timely as the opioid epidemic rages in in this
community, as around the country. In summary, this study will address three specific aims, testing
effectiveness of the TG prevention program on three distinct sets of outcomes: (1) Substance use among
youth: delaying the onset of use and reducing use among youth who initiated prior to program participation; (2)
Suicide risk among youth: reducing suicidal ideation and other risk factors for suicide and increasing protective
factors; and (3) Substance use among adults: Reducing use among adults participating in the program with
their children who report problematic levels of use at program entry."
10547778,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects approximately 10% of the general population and is especially common
among US veterans, affecting up to 36% of all VA users during FY2006-2014. All-cause and cardiovascular
(CV) morbidity and mortality are extremely high in veterans with CKD and ESRD, and African American
veterans have substantially higher rates of CKD and CV disease than whites. Traditional risk factors of
cardiovascular disease such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and obesity often show seemingly
anomalous, inverse associations with adverse outcomes among individuals with CKD and ESRD. To date
there are few therapeutic interventions proven to prevent the development of CKD, delay its progression, or
decrease morbidity/mortality in patients with CKD. There is also a lack of race-specific application of clinical
interventions, in spite of evidence suggesting that African-Americans may respond differently to various
therapies. The lack of clinical end point driven randomized controlled trials in this population necessitates
robust epidemiologic studies to provide preliminary results in support of future clinical trials, and to offer large-
scale, widely applicable evidence to inform clinical practice in cases when clinical trials are not feasible. Our
proposal will expand on our previous work using data obtained from the national VA research database, which
offers uniquely detailed sociodemographic and clinical information on millions of individuals across all parts of
the US.
The Specific Aims of our proposal are:
Aim 1: Examine the effect of interventions on clinical outcomes in veterans with non-dialysis dependent CKD
(NDD-CKD) overall and by race-ethnicity.
Aim 2: Examine the effect of interventions on incident CKD and on all-cause and cause-specific mortality,
CHD, incident stroke and incident CHF in veterans with normal baseline estimated GFR, overall and by race-
ethnicity.
Aim 3: Employ powerful graph theoretical algorithms and scalable supercomputer implementations to test and
extend the validity of the findings from Aims 1 and 2, and to help elucidate hidden factors and highlight
previously unknown relationships between condition, risk, treatment and outcome.
Next steps: This four-year project will generate a wealth of information to examine the above outcomes of
patients with all levels of kidney function, and could have significant implications for the care of US veterans
and also for patients with kidney diseases in general. Clinicians and guideline committees could use
information generated from our research to determine the most likely benefits for interventions without clinical
trial evidence, and this could help prioritization of healthcare expenditures and drug formularies. Clinical
trialists could also use information generated from our research to determine likely effect sizes for various
interventions and various subgroups that may be most prone to benefit from interventions. Furthermore,"
10794922,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The proposed project investigates the effects of experimental sleep disruption (SD) on opioid response in
males and females with chronic low back pain (CLBP). We propose that SD will alter two primary factors
strongly related to problematic opioid use: 1) measures of opioid abuse liability (self-report indices of âhow
highâ the drug makes you feel, âdrug likingâ and the monetary valuation of the drug after acute opioid
administration) and 2) opioid analgesic efficacy. We expect these responses will be more pronounced in
chronic low back pain (CLBP) vs. healthy controls, and in males to a greater extent than females. Our
preliminary data show that SD operates on several intermediate factors associated with both opioid abuse
liability and analgesia, including positive affect, pain sensitivity, and the function of the ventral striatum, the hub
of the brain reward system. Extant literature suggests that CLBP patients may be especially vulnerable to
these effects due to abnormal reward system neurocircuitry. The evaluation of sex differences in these
relationships is essential because males and females evidence different risk profiles with respect to opioid
addiction, sleep problems, and pain. The next step is to directly evaluate the effect of SD on opioid response in
these groups. We propose a within/between design in which male and female participants with CLBP (N=60)
and healthy controls (N=60) will experience both one night of SD and one night of normal sleep, in a random
order. Following each sleep condition, we will evaluate the opioid abuse liability and analgesic efficacy of
hydromorphone, a short-acting synthetic opioid with strong affinity for the Î¼-opioid receptor, in a placebo-
controlled cumulative dose run-up paradigm. Opioid abuse liability will be assessed with measures of drug
high, liking and the multiple choice procedure, which will measure the monetary valuation of the drug.
Analgesia will be assessed with quantitative sensory testing involving noxious thermal stimuli. We hypothesize
that opioid abuse liability will be augmented and analgesia diminished by SD. We expect those effects to be
stronger in patients with CLBP than healthy controls. Among CLBP patients, we anticipate that males will
evidence greater changes in opioid response following SD than females. This study fills a critical knowledge
gap with major implications for addressing the opioid epidemic. Findings from the proposed study will inform
clinical decision making related to the use of opioids for patients with chronic pain, and may lead to the
development of novel interventions targeting sleep as a means to mitigating problematic opioid use. Data from
the proposed project could lead to subsequent studies designed to determine the extent to which SD-induced
alterations in opioid abuse liability and analgesic efficacy are mediated by putative neurobiological
mechanisms (e.g., striatal function), which could themselves be targeted with pharmacological and/or
neurostimulation therapies in an effort to prevent problematic opioid use."
10768613,"Tumorigenesis involves the accumulation of genetic aberrations, leading to the emergence of
distinct clonal subpopulations. Studies that have tracked the evolution of genetic events within
and between these clonal populations have provided deep insights into the process of
tumorigenesis and response to therapy. Despite these advances, the process of metastasis,
which is responsible for over 90% of cancer-related deaths, remains poorly understood. The
majority of studies that compare genetic aberrations between the primary tumor and metastases
find few alterations that are unique to the metastatic clone. Indeed, there are no known
recurrent genetic drivers of metastasis. In contrast to primary tumor initiation and establishment,
my own future research directions hypothesize that the process of metastasis does not rely on
the further acquisition of novel genetic alterations beyond those needed to form primary tumor
cells, but is instead driven by alterations to the chromatin landscape, presenting itself in the form
of cellular plasticity and a reprogrammed cell state. We have uncovered evidence of a luminal-
to-basal transition (LBT) in breast cancers of the luminal B molecular subtype. The LBT is
essential for tumor progression as tumors that do not exhibit this plasticity show attenuated
metastatic ability and are more sensitive to chemotherapy. Based on these data we hypothesize
that the acquisition of tumor cell plasticity that allows breast cancer cells to stray from their
lineage-of-origin is an essential first step to initiating the metastatic cascade and disease
progression. This increased plasticity likely propels cells into a state that is highly adaptive to
new habitats and responsive to interactions with components of the tumor microenvironment, all
of which are critical to the process of metastasis. We propose to test this by elucidating the
effects of the LBT in luminal B breast cancers by assessing the stability of the cells that undergo
the transition, their tumor-initiating capacity and metastatic potential (aim 1). We will further
uncover the mechanisms driving the transition by studying the role of Sox4 in the emergence of
the basal cells of luminal origin, tracking its expression and determining its genome-wide
occupancy to reveal changes to its target gene repertoire during metastatic progression (aim 2).
We then propose to test the principle of tumor differentiation as a potential adjuvant to
chemotherapy by either combinatorial activation of GÎ±s R201C/fl and chemotherapy administration,
or by sequential activation of GÎ±s R201C/fl followed by chemotherapy administration."
10914760,"Project Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly disease with a dismal survival rate at just 10%, largely
because most patients are diagnosed after the cancer has spread beyond the pancreas. PDAC is thought to
arise from two types of noninvasive precancerous lesions, namely, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanINs),
and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN), that develop in the ductal epithelium of the pancreas.
Here, IPMNs are large cystic neoplasms that are incidentally detected at increasing frequencies through
abdominal imaging. Comprehensive genomic analyses indicate that activating mutations in KRAS, GNAS, and
PI3KCA are associated with IPMN pathogenesis. Although genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs)
have provided some insights into the development of IPMN, how IPMNs arise in humans in the context of
mutations that are exclusively found in IPMN lesions (GNAS and PIK3CA) and what cooperating events promote
progression to carcinoma is not understood. To address this question, we have developed a robust platform to
generate ductal and acini organoids from human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived pancreatic progenitor cells.
Using human exocrine pancreas, I have found that expression of GNASR201C in human ductal organoids
recapitulates several features of IPMN including lumen expansion, and secretion of mucins such as MUC2. This
study sets out to test the hypothesis that oncogenic GNAS promotes cell proliferation through PKA-independent
mechanisms in ductal cells and cooperates with other genetic events to promote initiation and progression of
IPMN lesions in vivo. Using a combination of cell biology, proteomics, and orthotopic transplantation approaches,
this proposal aims to identify mechanisms through which oncogenic GNAS differentially regulates cell
proliferation in ductal and acini pancreatic organoids (Aim1); and explore additional genetic events through which
oncogenic GNAS promotes formation of IPMN and IPMN-derived PDAC in the context of a physiologically
accurate tissue environment (Aim 2 and 3). The expected results will provide insights into the cell of origin for
IPMN lesions; identify mechanisms by which GNAS promotes early lesions; and establish models of IPMN-
derived PDAC, which may be exploited therapeutically in the long term to treat a broad range of IPMN-associated
tumors. The K22 award will allow participation in laboratory management, mentorship and grant writing
workshops, and enrolment in didactic courses, that will provide me with the necessary knowledge, resources
and training to (a) understand principles of omics research; (b) model cancer in mice; and (c) apply for additional
funding (R01) opportunities. Together with the support of my collaborators and establishment of an advisory
committee after obtaining a faculty position, my overall research, training and career development will help me
establish a unique niche in pancreatic cancer research as an independent investigator."
10582608,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of mortality in people with HIV (PWH) in sub-Saharan Africa, due in part
to delays in diagnosis and timely treatment. While HIV-infected persons often first seek care at peripheral clinics,
TB diagnostic testing equipment located in centralized laboratories require time-consuming specimen transport
and processing, resulting in delayed diagnosis and patient drop-out from care. Use of a point-of-care urine-based
test detecting mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan (LAM) has been successful in reducing mortality in a hospital
setting, but the existing test is insensitive in ambulatory patients. The largest burden of undiagnosed TB is in
PWH in non-hospital settings, and clinic-based testing assays and improved algorithms are urgently needed. A
promising novel, rapid, urine-based tests (nuLAM) has been developed that may overcome many barriers to TB
diagnosis, but has not yet been tested in a clinical setting. My central hypothesis is that rational use of next-
generation POC LAM testing will be an effective intervention for PWH in South Africa. I will test this hypothesis
with the following specific aims: 1) To develop an optimized clinical algorithm to identify HIV-infected outpatients
for TB testing using POC uLAM and guide evaluation of nuLAM. 2) To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the
next-generation LAM tests to detect TB in a population of HIV-infected outpatients attending a rural clinic in
South Africa, compared to rigorous validation standards of TB culture and GeneXpert. 3) To estimate the
population-level impact of nuLAM testing of outpatient PWH through costing and decision analysis. My career
goal is to become a physician-scientist with a focus on developing and implementing diagnostic approaches to
ultimately reduce morbidity and mortality from HIV-associated TB. I will use the opportunity of the K23 award to
obtain mentorship in predictive modeling, implementation science, and diagnostics science. These skills are
highly complementary to my strong background in epidemiologic methods and clinical research, and will enable
me to translate epidemiologic research findings into tools to help clinicians and policymakers improve
approaches to TB diagnosis. At the completion of the research and mentoring outlined, I will be well-positioned
to launch an independent research career with the ultimate goal of improving diagnosis, treatment, and care of
HIV-associated TB in sub-Saharan Africa."

Cryptosporidium remains a significant AIDS-related opportunistic infection among people with late HIV
diagnosis or without access to HAART. This parasite infects the gastrointestinal epithelium in humans;
infection is also a common cause of diarrhea in young children in developing countries. There is currently no
fully effective therapy available for the infection. Cryptosporidium has been referred as a âminimally invasiveâ
mucosal pathogen, and epithelial antimicrobial defense is key to mucosal innate anti-Cryptosporidium
immunity. Whereas it is well appreciated that Type II interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³) is required for preventing
development of intestinal cryptosporidiosis, recent advances have revealed a significant Type I IFN response
(e.g., induction of IFN-alpha and IFN-beta) in host epithelium following C. parvum infection. The molecular
mechanisms underlying Type I IFN response and its potential role in the pathogenesis of cryptosporidiosis are
unclear.
Cryptosporidium parvum virus 1
(CSpV1) is a member of the family Partitiviridae, genus Cryspovirus
that infects C. parvum and other Cryptosporidium spp. Our recent studies demonstrate that host delivery of
CSpV1-RNAs at the host-parasite interface can trigger a Type I IFN response in host cells. C. parvum infection
attenuates intestinal epithelial cell response to IFN-Î³ stimulation (i.e., infected cells are less susceptible to
activation by IFN-Î³). Surprisingly, knockout Type I IFN signaling in intestinal epithelial cells or inhibition of
CSpV1-RNA delivery can restore cellular response to IFN-Î³ stimulation and promotes resistance to C. parvum
infection, suggesting a negative impact of Type I IFN signaling on epithelial anti-Cryptosporidium defense.
Based on these observations, we hypothesize that cryptosporidial infection triggers Type I IFN response in the
intestinal epithelium and attenuates IFN-Î³-mediated epithelial antimicrobial defense through delivery of CSpV1-
RNAs. We will use in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo infection models and complementary biochemical, molecular,
and morphologic approaches to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which Cryptosporidium infection
triggers Type I IFN gene transcription in the intestinal epithelium (Aim 1), determine how Cryptosporidium
infection modulates the JAK/STAT signaling in infected intestinal epithelial cells (Aim 2), and define the impact
of Cryptosporidium-induced JAK/STAT signaling dysregulation on epithelial anti-parasite defense (Aim 3). The
proposal is conceptually innovative as it tests a novel mechanism for symbiotic CSpV1 in the pathogenesis of
cryptosporidiosis and has the potential to inform future development of new therapeutic strategies."

This application, aims to provide educational activities that encourage individuals from diverse backgrounds,
including those from groups underrepresented in the biomedical and environmental sciences, to pursue further
studies or careers in environmental health research. After securing funding from the NIH through this program
in 2015, we successfully launched the Program to Inspire Minority Undergraduates in Environmental Health
Science Research (PrIMER). With this competitive renewal we aim to continue the program's goal to increase
the diversity of the environmental and health research workforce in the environmental health sciences (EHS)
and ensure that future generations of environmental health researchers and public health practitioners come
from the entire pool of talented individuals, including underrepresented minorities, persons with disabilities, and
the socioeconomically challenged. Environmental health problems are increasingly complex and require the
successful integration of environmental and health sciences, among other disciplines. Research has
demonstrated that diverse research teams with respect to race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, other are
better at solving complex problems. To make headway against our toughest environmental health challenges,
it is thus essential that research teams are diverse in membership, interdisciplinary, and grounded in solid
knowledge and state-of-the art methods. For this new cycle, we thus propose to expand our training
opportunities. In addition to maintaining our outstanding training and research opportunities in the Department
of EHS at the Mailman School Public Health, the students will have new formal training opportunities at the
Earth Institute, the Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC), and other departments at MSPH
(Epidemiology and Sociomedical Sciences). This program aims to increase the number of diverse students
pursuing EHS related careers; to provide a robust research and education experience for participants in EHS
related topics, by having students work closely with faculty mentors and their teams on research projects
during the two years in the program; and to provide participants with the skills needed to help create
competitive applications for admission into programs for graduate studies, prioritizing fields relevant for EHS,
and to provide guidance throughout this process to ensure their success.
With the achievements and experience of initiating and running the PrIMER Program for the past 5 years, and
with feedback from students, participating faculty and our advisory board we are positioned to move ahead
with a better, stronger and more comprehensive program that covers the many aspects that comprise EHS
research. Columbia's reputation as a major research hub, its expert faculty, the extensive NIEHS research
portfolio, and its location in the ethnically diverse, culturally rich center of New York City, make it an ideal place
to carry out this work enabling us to contribute to NIEHS's goal of building a more diverse scientific workforce."

11011857,"Enrollment in high deductible health plans (HDHPs) has increased 50% in the past 5 years, with more than
45% of privately-insured Americans enrolled in such plans. HDHPs require patients to pay 100% of the costs of
most care (excluding some primary or secondary preventive care) out of pocket until a (high) deductible is met.
Services provided for chronic disease management are subject to this deductible. Therefore, it is unclear
whether this form of insurance supports healthy aging, especially for the 70% of Americans aged 50-64 (an
NIA priority population) with chronic illness. High patient cost-sharing has caused decreases in use of both
necessary and unnecessary health care. However, it is not known whether reductions in healthcare use mean
that patients are not receiving the types of healthcare required to manage their chronic diseases.
The overarching goal of this study is to ascertain whether the high cost-sharing design of HDHPs results in
chronically-ill patients not receiving the evidence-based, high-quality care recommended for management their
illnesses and secondarily, whether the cost barriers built into their design result in poorer health outcomes for
HDHP enrollees. We also estimate the magnitude of patient spending required to receive high quality care in
HDHPs versus non-HDHPs and investigate any race-, gender-, or income-based disparities in care
experienced by HDHP patients. We focus our HDHP investigations on patients who have one or more of the
following common chronic illnesses: diabetes, coronary artery disease, heart failure, asthma, hypertension, or
major depression. Lastly, we use a temporary benefit design change enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic
as an exogenous shock to understand the impact of HDHPs on receipt of recommended medical care.
Previously HDHP research has not focused on impacts on populations most in need of services (i.e., those
with chronic conditions) and the impact of HDHPs on disparities. We evaluate, for the substantial proportion of
mid-life adults with high healthcare needs, whether this common benefit design results in lower utilization of
care (due to high patient out-of-pocket costs) and adverse health outcomes.
Results from this work are policy-relevant. Findings can inform regulations regarding the exemption of chronic
disease management from insurance deductibles and identify the best way to support value-based insurance
design. To ensure findings reach decision makers, we will disseminate results through RAND Research Briefs
to insurance purchasers, leaders at insurance companies, state departments of insurance, and members of
Congress, in addition to traditional mechanisms of dissemination to the scientific community."
10672881,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obesity is associated with increased risk of developing and succumbing to endometrial cancer (EC), with ~60%
of EC patients being obese. Since programmed death protein-1 (PD-1) and its ligand, programmed death-ligand
1 (PD-L1), are highly expressed in ECs, immuno-oncologic inhibitors for these two targets hold great promise
for the treatment of obesity-driven EC, especially as ~25% of ECs have microsatellite instability, a known
biomarker for PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor response. Atezolizumab is one such anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb).
Our studies suggest the obesity-triggered pro-inflammatory uterine tumor milieu increases PD-L1/2, culminating
in enhanced susceptibility to atezolizumab. The efficacy of atezolizumab in EC may be enhanced via ONC201,
a small molecular selective dopamine receptor 2 antagonist that upregulates Tumor Necrosis Factor-Related
Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand and activates T and natural killer (NK) cells. Thus, ONC201 is a logical therapeutic
partner for atezolizumab.
However, the use of atezolizumab + ONC201 in EC is complicated by obesity. Compared to small molecule
drugs, mAbs are cleared via cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS; monocytes) which is part of the
innate immune system. MPS cells serve as a natural mechanism of uptake and clearance for mAbs via their Fc-
gamma-receptors (FcÉ£Rs). Our studies show MPS mediators, number of FcÉ£Rs and function in blood are highly
variable and associated with the high and clinically relevant variability in the
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of mAbs. Obese patients have higher and more variable MPS
mediators, FcÉ£Rs and function, resulting in lower exposures of mAbs. Thus, evaluating effects of obesity on the
PK/PD of atezolizumab and ONC201 in EC patients is clinically relevant and critically important. Our hypothesis
is that atezolizumab + ONC201 will be safe in EC; however, despite obese EC patients having higher expression
of PD-L1 and a pro-inflammatory tumor milieu, they will have lower atezolizumab plasma levels, than the non-
obese at the same dose due to increased phagocytic clearance, necessitating higher dosing in the obese to
achieve serum levels comparable to those of the non-obese patients.
We propose a phase 1 clinical trial of the novel combination of atezolizumab + ONC201 using an innovative
design of parallel cohorts of obese and non-obese patients with metastatic and recurrent EC. Our primary
objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the dual regimen of atezolizumab and ONC201 in obese and
non-obese EC patients to find the maximal tolerable dose combination to then advance for both cohorts in a
future phase 2 study. In order to comprehensively delineate the impact of obesity on the combination of
atezolizumab + ONC201, we will compare between the obese and non-obese EC groups the PK/PD of both
agents, biomarkers reflective of the immune-oncology and of the MPS clearance of both agents, and their
inflammatory metabolic signatures."

In response to the NIH U54 Faculty Institutional Recruitment for Sustainable Transformation (FIRST) Program
(RFA-RM-20-022), Drexel University proposes to establish a robust, transformative and sustainable
program to support diverse early career scientists engaged in health disparities research spanning
population science to intervention research. This proposal, a collaboration across Drexel University led by
Drexelâs Dornsife School of Public Health and College of Nursing and Health Professions, leverages our
nationally and internationally recognized NIH and other extramurally supported research, our community-based
clinical practices serving diverse, underserved communities, and our shared core values of social justice and
health equity guiding our pedagogy, research and hiring practices. Our proposal also strongly reflects Drexel
Universityâs unwavering commitment and newly instituted strategic goals to promote inclusive excellence and
ensure diversity, equity, retention, and promotion across for diverse faculty across their career pathways.
Our proposed program will create a collaborative structure involving multi-level inputs from University leaders,
academic units and faculty to catalyze sustainable institutional change that supports scientific and inclusive
excellence in the conduct of health disparities research. With support from the FIRST program, we will hire
and mentor a diverse (gender, race, ethnicity) group of 10 early-stage faculty in three clusters who are
competitive for tenure-track research positions with joint or secondary appointments across relevant
departments, programs, or colleges, Using evidence-based, multi-level mentorship strategies at the individual,
department, college and university levels, we will form a scientifically rigorous and supportive learning
community in which FIRST faculty will engage in individual and group activities leading to submissions of
competitive NIH R01 research proposals. FIRST faculty will be hired who are committed to diversity and whose
research addresses one of 3 pillars of health disparities research: detecting (defining/measuring health
disparities), understanding (identifying determinants of disparities), and/or reducing (intervene, evaluate,
translate, scale, policy) health inequities in cross-cutting thematic areas (aging, chronic disease, and/or
environmental determinants). Developing and supporting a cadre of diverse researchers has been identified as
an evidence-based strategy for advancing new methodologies, measures, and novel multi-level/multi-modal
interventions that address inequities and improve individual and population health outcomes. We will deploy a
multi-level and multi-methods evaluative approach guided by critical and intersectionality theories to evaluate
nuanced experiences of bias and structural discriminatory practices as well as program successes at the
individual, department, mentor, college and University levels of achieving inclusive excellence. Our FIRST
Program is co-led by nationally/internationally recognized leaders in population health, intervention science,
mentorship of racially/ethnically diverse faculty and evaluation of programs seeking inclusivity."

The overarching theme of the proposed Coccidioides Collaborative Research Center (CCRC) is to identify
molecules and pathways at the Coccidioides host-pathogen interface. Our long-term goal is to analyze the dialog
between fungus and the host immune system in the context of models (macrophages and mice) and in the
context of chronic and disseminated infections (in humans). Our expertise with basic mycology will facilitate our
determination of Coccidioides factors that are critical for causing disease. Our rich source of clinical samples
from the endemic region of California and our access to technological innovation will facilitate our ability to identify
molecules, cells, metabolites, and pathways that correlate with a patient context that is permissive or restrictive
for dissemination. Our expertise with data analysis will promote the integration of our molecular findings to
generate an understanding of host response pathways that are correlated with disease state and clinical outcome.
Additionally, we will evaluate the diagnostic potential of Coccidioides antigens and host biomarkers, thereby
closing existing gaps in the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis. At the same time, we will make key basic
discoveries in microbial biology and host response, driving the field of fungal pathogenesis and medical mycology
forward. Finally, by integrating the data from Projects and Cores, we hope to identify new molecular targets for
anti-fungal development as well as host pathways that could be targeted by novel or existing biologics to tip the
immune response in favor of the host."
10618138,"ABSTRACT
Numerous studies have documented racial & ethnic disparities in sleep deficiency among adolescents &
adults. These disparities are thought to be explained partially by experiences of interpersonal racial
discrimination. What remains lacking is knowledge of the causal mechanisms linking structural racism to poor
sleep health. The long-term goal is to reduce racial disparities in health. The scientific objective of this
application is to determine the extent to which structural racism, as manifested in racial disparities in police use
of deadly force, leads to racial disparities in sleep health. This application focuses on police use of deadly force
on unarmed black Americans as a cardinal manifestation of structural racism. The central hypothesis is that
police use of deadly force on unarmed black Americans leads to unhealthy sleep among other black
Americans in the general U.S. population. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of strong
preliminary data showing that police use of deadly force on unarmed black Americans leads to poor mental
health among other black Americans in the general U.S. population. The rationale for this application is that
detailed understanding of the causal mechanisms linking structural racism to poor sleep health is likely to offer
a strong scientific framework for developing and targeting structural and psychosocial interventions to reduce
racial disparities in sleep, cardiometabolic, and other health outcomes. The central hypothesis will be tested by
pursuing three specific aims: 1) Estimate the extent to which police use of deadly force on unarmed black
Americans is causally associated with poor sleep health among other adult black Americans in the general
U.S. population. 2) Estimate the extent to which police use of deadly force on unarmed black Americans is
causally associated with poor sleep health among other children and adolescent black Americans in the
general U.S. population. 3) Elaborate a conceptual framework identifying the mechanisms that link racial
disparities in police use of deadly force to racial disparities in sleep health. In Aims 1 & 2, population-based
survey data from 2013-18 will be merged with novel, high-resolution geocoded data on police killings and
analyzed using quasi-experimental regression models. In Aim 3, qualitative interviews will be conducted in 5
U.S. cities to build a grounded theory about structural racism and sleep health. Potential mediating pathways,
and effect modification by age and sex, will be explored in all aims. The key innovation of the proposed
research is to pair quasi-experimental, population-based studies with qualitative research to investigate a novel
contributor to racial disparities in sleep health. The findings will have significant public health impact because
they will provide proof of principle for development and targeting of structural and psychosocial interventions to
reduce racial disparities in sleep health."
10910926,"Cornell University aims to increase the number of minoritized faculty in the biological, biomedical, and
health sciences through establishing an NIH FIRST Program at Cornell University. Cornell FIRST will
support the hiring and retention of 10 new assistant professors from groups underrepresented in their fields,

program is its foundational roots as a complex private institution with a public mission, with its founding
based on support for diversity, a culture of interdisciplinary research, and a track record of catalyzing
change at different scales that were institutionalized. Given Cornellâs success in establishing programs for
the effective development and support of early-career faculty, particularly those underrepresented in their
fields, Cornell is in an excellent position to test the hypothesis that FIRST Cohort faculty will be
successful in an environment that supports advocacy through sponsorship, consistent and
individual-centered mentoring, and evidence-based professional development. We further
hypothesize that Cornellâs institutional culture and scientific excellence will be enhanced with the
hiring of a FIRST Cohort of diverse faculty. Cornellâs FIRST program features interdisciplinary hiring of
faculty underrepresented in their fields, across six colleges and 20 departments, with a focus on retention,
career development, and evaluation. Cornell proposes 1) to hire a diverse cohort of 10 new faculty into
3 research clusters, taking advantage of Cornellâs existing interdisciplinary field system approach where
faculty are organized by research interest rather than by department, within broad areas of quantitative
biomedical sciences, infection biology, and health equity; 2) foster sustainable institutional culture
change using novel combinations of institutional policies that impact hiring, mentoring, promotion and
tenure, salary equity, and other initiatives aimed at enhancing compositional diversity, retention, and
success; 3) enhance faculty development, retention, progression, and promotion building on Cornellâs
track record of successfully developing and implementing cutting edge programs that effectively support
faculty through their career, particularly those underrepresented in their fields; and 4) to evaluate and learn
from our hiring, climate, and faculty development approaches by identifying which strategies and
activities are most effective and sustainable at an institutional scale assessing our progress to ensure
that they are developed and implemented in an effective manner, and effectively interact with the FIRST
CEC. We expect that the Cornell FIRST program will successfully hire, retain, and support 10 new faculty
underrepresented in their fields, while fostering sustainable institutional culture change to support inclusive
excellence. Cornell FIRST will increase faculty diversity in the biological, biomedical, and health sciences
while contributing to the diversity of academy, and future generations of the STEM workforce."
10579891,"SUMMARY: Oligodendrocyte extracellular vesicles: a novel therapy for CNS autoimmunity.
Current therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) target the immune system in an antigen (Ag)-nonspecific manner,
with potentialy serious side effects due to systemic immunosuppression. A longstanding goal in MS research is
to devise an Ag-specific therapy that would suppress only harmful immune responses, while leaving the rest of
the immune system intact. The prerequisite for Ag-specific therapy is identification of the target Ag. MS
pathogenesis is widely believed to be driven by autoimmunity against myelin Ags. However, the relevant Ag(s)
in MS remains speculative, with the possibility that these Ags differ among patients, and over time in the same
patient. Numerous approaches for Ag-specific suppression of autoimmune neuroinflammation have been proven
in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. These approaches rely on re-
establishing peripheral tolerance for self-Ag by delivering the same self-Ag in a non-inflammatory context (eg. in
PBS) via various routes, such as intravenous (i.v.), oral, or nasal. However, translation of these experimental
strategies into MS therapy has been hampered by uncertainty about the relevant Ags in MS patients. In
addressing this issue, we reasoned that if for tolerance induction we used oligodendrocyte (Ol)-derived
extracellular vesicles (Ol-EVs), which naturally contain most or all of the myelin Ags, it would be unnecessary to
identify the relevant myelin Ag(s) in each patient. Further, we also posited that i.v. injection of Ol-EVs will
suppress EAE, similar to well-documented i.v. tolerance induction by free self-peptide. Indeed, our data show
that Ol-EVs contained all the relevant myelin Ags and upon i.v. injection ameliorated ongoing EAE in an Ag-
dependent manner, suggesting that Ol-EVs can be a universal therapeutic agent for MS. Based on these and
additional preliminary data, we hypothesize that human and mouse Ol-EVs contain all relevant myelin Ags, and
upon i.v. administration will ameliorate EAE induced by various myelin Ags. We additionally hypothesize that this
effect is Ag-dependent and mediated by the IFN-ï§/IL-27/PD-L1 axis. This hypothesis will be tested in the following
specific aims: Aim 1. To determine the therapeutic efficacy of Ol-EVs in several EAE models. Since the
significance of this project is to study Ol-EVs as a potential therapy for MS, and we do not know the relevant
Ag(s) in MS, we will test the hypothesis that OL-EVs/i.v. can suppress EAE induced by any myelin Ag, because
all the relevant Ags are present in OL-EVs. Aim 2. To define the mechanism of EAE suppression by Ol-EVs.
Our preliminary data provide a basis for the hypothesis that Ol-EVs/i.v. induce tolerogenic APCs, which diminish
pathogenic Th cell response and suppress EAE via expression of immunoregulatory molecules. Aim 3. To study
the effects of human Ol-EVs in human myelin Ag-induced EAE, and in humanized mice. We will optimize
production of human Ol-EVs, and test the hypothesis that human Ol-EVs/i.v. have adequate therapeutic efficacy
in EAE models, and in humanized mice to determine if findings in mice are paralleled in this human-like system."
10808040,"Project Summary
Cancer prevention programs can reduce cancer incidence, cancer-related deaths, and healthcare costs. Yet
population-level cancer prevention programs are expensive and difficult to implement, and their benefit must
be weighed against the risk of overdiagnosis and harms associated with followup care. An emerging view is
that prevention efforts ought to be focused on the populations at highest risk.
In an era of precision medicine, Precision Prevention would objectively measure a person's past exposure to a
risk factor in order to predict that person's risk of cancer or occupational disease. High-risk individuals would
then be monitored frequently by a specialist. Skin cancers are an ideal starting point because they are nearly
as frequent as all other human cancers combined, the carcinogen is typically ultraviolet light (UV), the
carcinogenic DNA adduct is known to be the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD), and the tissue is readily
accessible. The present project takes advantage of two recent technical advances in order to assess individual
risk and answer basic questions about using DNA adductomics for risk prediction.
First, the project uses whole-genome genomics to identify ""genomic dosimeters"", genome regions in skin that
are up to 1041 fold more sensitive to UV than expected from the genome-wide average. Second, it uses a
nonscarring surfactant-based skin biopsy method (Surfactant-mediated Tissue Acquisition for Molecular
Profiling, STAMP) in order to increase recruitment rates for human studies and allow sampling of multiple non-
diseased sites from a single subject; non-diseased sites reflect the initial exposure more closely than tumor
sites do. The project begins by adapting these methods to small samples of human skin, then determines how
CPDs in genomic dosimeters vary with UV exposure to normal skin, and finally determines how the incidence
of several types of skin cancer varies with the genomic dosimeter CPD level in sun-exposed normal skin, in
order to construct a cancer-probability metric. The results will establish a route to Precision Prevention using
adductomics."

Skeletal muscle loss and impairment â prominent features of the aging process â lead to physical disability.
There is plausible evidence that altering components of the diet, mainly protein intake and acid/base balance,
may improve indices of muscle health in older adults and thus translate to a reduction in physical disability. A
growing number of studies suggest that increasing protein intake using a whey protein supplement may benefit
muscle health in older adults. However, a main concern is that high protein results in a large dietary acid load
from the breakdown of protein to acidogenic byproducts, which could in turn promote muscle degradation
particularly in older adults with age-related declines in renal excretion of acid. Thus, our hypothesis is that the
balance between the amount of protein in the diet (anabolic component) and the net acid load of the diet
(catabolic component) in part determines whether the diet as a whole has a net anabolic or catabolic effect on
muscle. Preliminary data from our group have suggested that a daily potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3)
supplement improved lower extremity muscle power in postmenopausal women. Based on our preliminary data,
we plan to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial study in which sedentary men
and women age 65 and older on baseline lower protein diets will be enrolled. Participants will assigned to one
of four groups: either a whey protein supplement (to raise protein intake to 1.5 g/kg/d) with or without KHCO3
81 mmol/d or an isocaloric placebo supplement with or without KHCO3 81 mmol/d for 24 wks. The primary
outcome is lower extremity muscle power. Secondary outcomes are lower extremity muscle endurance,
physical performance, lean mass, and 24-hr urinary nitrogen excretion. Twenty-four-week changes in these
outcomes will be compared in the 4 groups. Our central hypothesis is that higher protein intake plus a
neutralizing alkaline salt will have additive effects on muscle performance and mass in older adults to either
intervention alone. If successful, this research could result in a paradigm shift in dietary advice to older adults
to reduce physical disability. As 1 in 5 US adults will be over age 65 by year 2040, a safe dietary intervention
that reduces age-related musculoskeletal decline will be an important preventative health step for our aging
society."

San Antonio has a rich tradition of excellence in the field of Medical Mycology, including
Coccidioidomycosis, also referred to as Valley Fever. These infections affect hundreds of thousands of
healthy and immunocompromised individuals in the endemic areas of the arid Southwest U.S., with a
majority of cases in California and Arizona. There are very few drugs to treat these infections and no
vaccine is available. Growing levels of antibiotic resistance are a major concern, and the latest data on the
expansion of the geographical area of infection is very worrisome. To address these major shortcomings,
we propose the establishment of the San Antonio-based Coccidioidomycosis Collaborative Research
Center (SA-CCRC). The new Center will be a highly collaborative place for synergistic multi- and
interdisciplinary interactions by members of the Center, which include highly experienced investigators in
the field of Coccidioides research, as well as others with substantial knowledge and/or technical expertise
in other areas whose talents are being attracted to this field for the very first time. Overall, the SA-CCRC
creates an optimal cohesive infrastructure to support integrated research, leverages resources at each of
the participating sites and organizations, and also extends to the establishment of novel academic-
industrial partnerships. Our Center has a strong translational emphasis, being distinctively focused on the
development of antifungal drugs and vaccines against coccidioidomycosis. The center is anchored by an
administrative core which will serve a central hub for providing the necessary organizational, administrative
and financial oversight structure for the Centerâs day-to-day operations. The overall objectives for the SA-
CCRC are: i) to advance basic, translational and clinical research in the field of Coccidioidomycosis via
investigator-driven research projects, ii) to adapt, develop and implement state of the art techniques to the
Coccidioidomycosis field of research in support of the three different projects and the coccidioidomycosis
community at large, and iii) to administer a Development and Research Program for pilot funding and
mentoring of junior investigators and those new to the field of coccidioidomycosis. Altogether, the proposed
SA-CCRC program will fill critical voids and will have a powerful and sustainable effect on the field of
coccidioidomycosis research."

The goal of R01DA013324 renewal is to investigate the host genetic basis for hepatitis B virus (HBV) recovery
in persons living with and without HIV. HBV Infection results in either a successful immune response and
recovery or a chronic infection. Anti-viral drugs control HBV replication but cannot cure chronic hepatitis B
(CHB). Moreover, lifelong therapy is unsustainable for many, which is a major threat to the calls to eliminate
HBV by 2030. A cure for HBV is urgently needed. Understanding how HBV infection is naturally controlled in
many infected persons may provide lessons for how to produce a âfunctionalâ cure. There is overwhelming
evidence that host genetic differences explain why some persons can recover from an HBV infection including
family studies, candidate gene studies, and genome wide association studies (GWAS) in Asian populations.
However, these prior GWAS excluded European- and African-ancestry populations despite high HBV
endemicity in Africa (>6% of the population has CHB). We propose to renew R01013324 to fill in the missing
knowledge on host genetic basis for HBV recovery and to extend that work by detailed studies of host and
virus. To this end, Aim 1 focuses on discovering novel genetic variants in a panel of African ancestry
individuals by comparing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from existing GWAS data in persons with
HBV recovery (N=8667) and with CHB (N=1594). The inclusion of persons living with HIV (PLWH) allows
comparisons of mechanisms of recovery based on HIV. Aim 2 follows by performing a trans-ethnic GWAS
analysis using the African ancestry panel from Aim 1 along with European ancestry individuals from North
America and the UK Biobank and with Chinese ancestry individuals. These GWAS data are available through
collaborators and will also include PLWH. Aim 3 focuses on integrating the host genomic data from Aims 1 and
2 with viral genomics to understand the influence of the host immune response on the viral genome. Deep
sequencing of HBV will be performed on 759 individuals to determine viral amino acid changes that are

10548195,"ABSTRACT: Development of skeleton in mammals is an exceedingly complex process. Completion of both
endochondral and intramembranous ossification entails a highly intricate but well-coordinated process of
patterning, cell fate commitment, differentiation, growth, and remodeling. These events are specified by a
coordinated temporal and spatial pattern of gene expression. At first, secreted morphogens such as
hedgehog, bone morphogenetic proteins, wingless proteins, and others, signal to key transcription factors
to specify gene expression. Runx2 is an essential transcription factor for both chondrocyte and osteoblast
differentiation. Runx2 gene deletion results in embryonic lethality due to a complete failure of bone
formation. In humans, mutation of the Runx2 gene causes cleidocranial dysplasia, a dominantly inherited
skeletal disorder. Another master regulator of skeletogenesis is the Specificity protein-7 (Sp7). Sp7 belongs
to the Sp subgroup of the KrÃ¼ppel-like family of transcription factors characterized by three zinc-finger DNA-
binding domains. Deletion of Sp7 gene results in failure of osteoblasts, and bone formation. In humans,
mutation of the Sp7 gene is linked with the recessive form of osteogenesis imperfecta, skeletal fragility and
delayed tooth eruption. However, very little is known about the underlying molecular mechanism for the
surprisingly similar phenotype from the two seemingly unrelated proteins. Runx2 is required for the
expression of Sp7, as mice with targeted disruption of the Runx2 gene completely lack expression of Sp7.
In sharp contrast, the Runx2 expression is normal in the skeletal cells of Sp7 null animals. The functional
incompetency of Runx2 in the Sp7 null mice suggests that Sp7 presence is obligatory for completion of the
Runx2 osteogenic activity. It is important to note that the observation of Runx2 expression in Sp7 null mice
is limited to only RNA, determined by in situ hybridization of embryonic tissues. Our data show that despite
normal levels of Runx2 mRNA, Runx2 protein is highly unstable in skeletal tissues of Sp7 null mice. We
further demonstrate that Runx2 and Sp7 proteins form a molecular complex and their transcriptional activity
is regulated by unique posttranslational modifications. Our findings strongly suggest that in skeletal cells,
Sp7 acts as a molecular rheostat and is necessary for functional stability and turnover of Runx2 protein.
Our experiment will assess endogenous levels of Runx2 protein in Sp7 null background and by a regulated
and selective gene reconstitution in osteoprogenitor cells. The goal of this application is to identify and
define a) spatial and temporal organization and assembly of Runx2 and Sp7 regulatory complexes for the
formation and/or maintenance of osteoblasts and b) mechanisms supporting the stable complex formation
and retention of competency for skeletal gene expression. Knowledge obtained from this study will provide
molecular insights into components of a bone regulatory complex that can be targeted for innovative
therapy to improve cartilage and bone formation and repair."

The incidence of children with inherited neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) is high in LMICs, and an
enormous burden on heathcare resources. While individual inherited NDDs are rare, in aggregate they affect
millions of people. Identifying the genetic etiology of NDDs is beneficial to families, communities and science.
Genetic diagnosis allows families to recognize risk of recurrence, and act on anticipatory prognoses. Genetic
discoveries drive public health policy aimed at reducing disease burden through community genetics. Genes that
cause NDDs provide molecular insights into normal brain development and pathogenesis of disorders. Whole
exome sequencing (WES) has risen to the forefront of genetic testing in HMIC, based on its potential to uncover
the genetic basis of inherited NDDs, but is infrequently used in LMICs. An ongoing collaboration between Dr.
Shukla at Kasturba Medical College at Manipal University, India and Dr. Bielas in the Department of Human
Genetics at University of Michigan, US, has developed a sustainable strategy to use WES-based testing for
genetic diagnosis of NDDs in India. With a diagnostic yield on par with HMIC, WES-based genetic testing will be
an important tool in address the elevated burden of inherited NDD in India. We propose experiments to delineate
genetic diversity of South-East Asian ancestry. For two genes we identified as novel genetic etiologies of NDDs,
the same pathogenic variant was detected in unrelated affected Indian families, indicative of a founder effect
with higher carrier frequency in the Indian population. This finding highlights the uneven representation of diverse
populations in genomic studies. The lack of parity in sequence representation and functional studies originating
from India, is a scientific and health challenge that negatively impact interpretation of genetic variants. We
hypothesize that disparities in representation of diverse populations in genomic sequencing studies impact
interpretation of deleterious alleles and genetic diagnosis of NDDs in India, which contribute to inequity in
genomic medicine globally. We will address this challenge by defining genetic diversity in a larger cohort of
South-East Asian ancestry (Aim1), functionally characterizing variants to support their classification as
pathogenic (Aim 2) and reduce uneven representation of diverse populations in genomic medicine by developing
a searchable web-based platform to make de-identified genetic diversity identified in Indian ancestry publically
available (Aim 3). Our experimental strategy prioritizes educational exchange and research infrastructure, that
fosters sustainable strategies to tackle these important problems."
11163197,"Project Summary/Abstract
 A central issue in the research of memory is how the brain integrates information available in the
environment with our prior knowledge from past experiences to facilitate memory formation and retrieval.
The current project approaches this issue by examining how perceptual features and prior knowledge
contribute to the likelihood that a stimulus can be remembered by any given observer, a phenomenon
often attributed to stimulus memorability. The long-term goal of this project is to foster the applicantâs
development as an independent investigator focused on the mechanisms of memory formation and
retrieval to develop mechanism-based interventions for memory deficits in aging and cognitive diseases.
The overall objective of this project is to elucidate how prior knowledge contributes to stimulus
memorability by allowing the applicant to obtain further training in memory research at the NIH based on
computational modeling of large-scale behavioral data (with Chris Baker) and analyses of fine-scale
neural data (with Kareem Zaghloul). In contrast to the traditional view that memorability is merely a
perceptual attribute of stimuli irrespective of observersâ prior knowledge, the central hypothesis of this
proposal is that prior knowledge represented in semantic imbued brain regions, such as the anterior
temporal lobe (ATL), makes remembering more likely irrespective of stimulus perceptual features
processed in inferotemporal regions. The rationale for this project is that determining the mechanisms for
memorability will inform how memory is efficiently formed and retrieved, thereby improved diagnoses and
interventions for memory deficits can be developed. Meanwhile, this project will also provide the
applicant with the means to establish early research independence. The central hypothesis will be tested
with these specific aims: 1) Specify how semantic features contribute to stimulus memorability (K99); 2)
Characterize fine-scale neural mechanisms underlying semantic contributions to stimulus memorability
(K99-R00); 3) Manipulate memorability via training and brain stimulation (R00). Based on large-scale
behavioral data, Aim 1 will model and isolate the contributions of semantic features to the memorability
of scene images, where both perceptual and semantic features are available to support memory. Aim 2
will use multi-level direct recording of temporal lobe activity in humans to determine how the ATL
underlies semantic contributions to stimulus memorability. Aim 3 will investigate the causal relationship
between prior semantic knowledge and memorability via behavioral training and electrical stimulation
over the ATL. This project is innovative because it will establish a novel neurocognitive mechanism for
memorability driven by prior semantic knowledge using innovative tools that address the limitations
inherent to other methods. This project is significant because it will ultimately have a positive impact on
promoting better diagnosis and intervention strategies to improve memory in cognitive disorders."

10732537,"Project Summary
Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a nonpharmacological intervention for the treatment of chronic pain. Importantly,
SCS may be more effective than opioids for pain relief and has been demonstrated to reduce opioid misuse in
pain patients. Current SCS therapy uses time-invariant pulses (TIP), which is based on stimulation with fixed
parameter pulse trains. However, SCS based on TIP stimulation has two critical challenges: 1) limited ability to
contour the location and quality of the paresthesia coverage and 2) loss of treatment effect due to tolerance.
To overcome these challenges, we propose the use of novel stimulation time variant pulse (TVPs) patterns, in
which a stimulation parameter changes according to a modulatory time-varying function. TVPs may provide
better therapy than TIPs in two ways. First, TVPs can change the recruitment of dorsal column fibers on a pulse
by pulse basis in a way impossible via TIPs. Support for this comes from our pilot pre-clinical study in which we
demonstrated that TVPs can generate dorsal column evoked compound action potentials (ECAPs) whose
morphologies vary with the applied TVPs. Second, the time-varying nature of TVPs may produce better sensory
encoding compared to TIPs. Support for this comes from preliminary results from our own and an independent
pilot, acute clinical study suggesting that TVPs can produce dynamic, enhanced coverage of the painful region
and improved perceived sensations in chronic pain patients.
Our central hypotheses is that TVPs can improve outcomes for SCS by enhancing paresthesia coverage and
reducing tolerance by varying spatial neuronal recruitment. In this proposal, we will develop devices capable of
delivering TVPs and perform long-term clinical testing in chronic pain patients to define the role of TVP SCS in
the management of intractable chronic pain. In this study, we will develop the firmware and software to deliver
TVPs, and obtain IRB and IDE approval for a clinical study using an implantable pulse generator capable of
delivering TVPs (Aim 1/UG3). Then, we will conduct a First in Human feasibility study with a double-blind,
randomized-controlled design (Aim 2/UH3), to determine the extent to which SCS TVP can reduce pain and
disability."

The Yale Superfund Research and Training Program (YSRTP) is driven by regulatory and community-based
concerns about emerging contaminants that affect water resources and drinking water supplies at multiple sites
in the US. The YSRTP has chosen to study 1,4-dioxane (1,4-DX) because of its common occurrence in
Superfund sites and drinking water supplies, and its USEPA and IARC classification as a possible human
carcinogen. The carcinogenic mechanism in the liver is unknown and its interaction with co-occurring and
carcinogenic water contaminants (1,1,1-trichloroethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethylene, and 1,1-dichloroethane) has
never been evaluated in either animals or humans. Given that liver cancer incidence rates have more than tripled
since 1980, there is an urgent need to evaluate whether emerging water contaminants, such as 1,4-DX, may be
contributing to this increase. Importantly, a lack of biomarkers of exposure to or the biological effects of 1,4 -DX
have hampered epidemiologic studies, risk assessment and setting standards for the contaminant. In addition,
the high polarity and low biodegradability of 1,4-DX restrict the ability to remove it from aquifer systems or
drinking water. Indeed, available treatment technology is both expensive and not readily applied to water
supplies. The YSRTP will foster problem-based, solution-oriented research related to 1,4-DX and its co-occurring
contaminants through innovative approaches to evaluate environmental occurrence and human exposure,
understand the underlying basis of adverse health effects, provide cost-effective remedial mitigation solutions
and ultimately set the stage for improved regulation of this emerging contaminant. The YSRTP will carry out
highly interactive projects to: (a) examine the health effects and biomarkers of exposure/effect to 1,4-DX (alone
and as a mixture with its co-occurring contaminants) in animal models and humans, and (b) develop systems to
monitor and mitigate human exposure to 1,4-DX in water. The biomedical science research projects will elucidate
the mechanism(s) associated with 1,4-DX liver toxicity and carcinogenesis in mouse and zebrafish models
(project 1), and exposure assessment and early biologic responses to 1,4-DX in human populations (project 2).
The environmental science and engineering research projects will create highly-sensitive and selective
electrochemical sensors for on-site, real-time detection of 1,4-DX (project 3) and develop innovative advanced
oxidation processes for mitigation technology (project 4). Successful completion of these innovative studies will
make a significant positive health impact by more clearly defining the health risks of 1,4-DX, elucidating
biomarkers of exposure, and establishing effective new ways to monitor and mitigate this important emerging
contaminant. Our systems approach integrates and links the research projects with the development of effective
communication and education of stakeholders, and training of future scientists to ensure the program has a far-
reaching impact on how emerging contaminants are addressed both in the US and globally."

We will develop and apply a new high-throughput methodology for rapidly
designing and testing antibodies for a myriad of purposes, including cancer and
infectious disease immunotherapeutics. We will improve upon current
approaches for antibody design by providing time, cost, and humane benefits
over immunized animal methods and greatly improving the power of present
synthetic methods that use randomized designs. To accomplish this, we will
display millions of computationally designed antibody sequences using recently
available technology, test the displayed antibodies in a high-throughput format at
low cost, and use the resulting test data to train molecular dynamics and
machine learning methods to generate new sequences for testing. Based on our
test data our computational method will identify sequences that have ideal
properties for target binding and therapeutic efficacy. We will accomplish these
goals with three specific aims. We will develop a new approach to integrated
molecular dynamics and machine learning using control targets and known
receptor sequences to refine our methods for receptor generalization and model
updating from observed data (Aim 1). We will design an iterative framework
intended to enable identification of highly effective antibodies within a minimal
number of experiments, in which our methods automatically propose promising
antibody sequences to profile in subsequent assays (Aim 2). We will employ
rounds of automated synthetic design, affinity test, and model improvement to
produce highly target-specific antibodies. (Aim 3).

10589938,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We developed a tissue engineered vascular graft (TEVG) designed specifically for use in congenital heart
surgery. The TEVG is made by seeding autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells onto a
biodegradable tubular scaffold. Once implanted the scaffold degrades and the TEVG transforms into a
neovessel that resembles a native blood vessel both in structure and function. Results of the first FDA-
approved clinical trial evaluating the use of the TEVG in children demonstrated that the TEVG is the first man-
made vascular conduit that grows making it uniquely suited for use in the surgical repair of complex congenital
heart defects, however; results of this study also demonstrated that incidence of stenosis was too high to
recommend routine use of this promising technology. We subsequently developed an improved, second-
generation TEVG that incorporates both rationally designed strategies for inhibiting the formation of TEVG
stenosis and process improvement measures for assembling the TEVG, in addition to newer less stringent
criteria for performing TEVG angioplasty. Herein we propose the next step in the development and translation
of the TEVG: a single-institution, prospective, single-armed, exploratory-confirmatory clinical trial designed to
evaluate the safety and efficacy of the second-generation TEVG in 24 patients over a 2-year period. In this
study, we will evaluate the short-term (2 year) safety and efficacy of a second-generation TEVG for use as an
extracardiac conduit in children with single ventricle cardiac anomalies undergoing modified Fontan surgery.
We will serially monitor all graft recipients over a 2-year time course using echocardiography and MRI. We
hypothesize that the second-generation TEVG will have a significantly lower incidence of critical stenosis
compared to the results of original TEVG in our previous FDA-approved pilot study. In addition, we hypothesize
that the TEVG will grow and transform over time into a highly compliant capacitance vessel. We will evaluate
the effect of graft compliance on flow, turbulence, and power loss across the TEVG in the Fontan circulation.
The development of a man-made vascular graft with growth capacity would enable the performance of
definitive reconstructive surgical procedures at an early age and mitigate the need for additional surgeries due
to somatic overgrowth (the process by which a child outgrows their implant), thereby improving outcomes in
patients with congenital heart disease."

With an increasing proportion of the population at older ages (i.e., the `graying of America'), there is a growing
prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRDs). The increase in proportion of older
Americans is happening at a faster rate among minority populations compared with non-Hispanic Whites
(NHWs), for instance, the number of âoldestâ Americans is expected to grow by 81% among non-Hispanic Whites
compared to 131% growth among Non-Hispanic Blacks (NHBs) and 328% among Hispanics, by the year 2030.
Paralleling this increased racial disparity in the proportion of oldest Americans, is also a racial disparity in the
incidence and prevalence of ADRDs. For instance, there is significantly higher prevalence of all dementias
among NHBs compared to NHWs, with NHB men and women having a 2 â 2.5 times the prevalence among
NHW men or women. Among NHB men, the prevalence of Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is 2.5 times that among
NHW men. When only vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) is examined, NHBs were more than
twice as likely to develop VCID even after adjusting for differences in cumulative incidence of stroke, stroke
severity and known vascular and dementia risk factors. Suggesting the need to identify other factors that could
be contributing to the observed racial or black-white disparity. Our overall goals are to (1) determine whether
there is a black-white disparity in the prevalence of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) defined markers of CSVD
among participants in the REGARDS cohort with confirmed stroke/TIA and (2) identify the contributions of CSVD
and ADRD genetic and vascular risk factors to the black-white disparity in VCIDs) and ADRDs. We hypothesize
that among REGARDS participants who had a stroke or TIA, the black-white disparity in the prevalence and
trajectory of VCI and ADRDs is partly due to black-white disparity in the prevalence and burden of CSVD, which
could be related to differences in the distribution of vascular and ADRD genetic risk factors. CSVDs are MRI
detected brain lesions whose components are cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), white matter hyperintensity (WMH)
lesions, lacunes and enlarged perivascular spaces (ePVS) and are associated with vascular risk factors as well
as incidence and prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia. Our hypothesis will be tested based on the
following aims: (1) Determine the prevalence, pattern and racial/geographic difference in CSVD and variation in
brain volumetric parameters. (2) Examine the association between vascular and genetic (APOE Îµ4, ABCA7 and
TREM2) risk factors, and prevalence or disparity in CSVD and brain volumes. (3) Determine the association
between CSVD, brain volumetric measures and incidence, prevalence and trajectory as well as any observed
black-white disparity in risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. Completing the above aims will enable us to
identify a high-risk population for more targeted VCID prevention or treatment strategies to potentially reduce
black-white disparity in VCID. Additionally, the MRI scans retrieved, and the phenotype derived will be a useful
resource for further research in REGARDS."

â either direct spread or indirect environmental amplification â remain unknown. Bacterial whole genome

Gay and bisexual men and other sexual minority men (SMM) in the U.S. are burdened by a high and
disproportionate rate of HIV infection. Improving outcomes of the HIV Care Continuum through to maintaining
viral load (VL) suppression is associated with a significant reduction in the sexual transmission of HIV and
significantly better long-term health outcomes. However, little research provides insight into the preventable
structural, psychosocial, and behavioral factors that influence durable VL suppression during early infection
that can be used in developing effective early intervention strategies. Moreover, the successful implementation
of TasP and U=U messaging is a necessary component of the strategy to end the HIV epidemic, but rigorous
research is needed to address real-world implementation issues, including safety concerns and perceived
barriers among key stakeholder populations. We aim to address these issues with two studies grounded in the
Social Ecological Model (SEM) to simultaneously examine both VL suppression and implementation barriers
surrounding U=U from multiple levels of influence. Specifically, Aim 1 of the study is to examine time to initial
VL suppression and patterns in VL rebound to better understand the dynamic nature of VL suppression and
use the SEM along with an intersectional minority stress framework to longitudinally investigate structural,
psychosocial, and behavioral factors associated with VL suppression among SMM to better understand risk
and resilience. Next, Aim 2 is to examine how adherence and perceived VL status are associated with
objective VL status and whether concordance between perceived and actual VL suppression influences sexual
risk compensation as captured by event-level sexual behaviors and STI infections. Finally, Aim 3 is designed to
understand ongoing barriers to implementing U=U from the perspectives of the three populations critical to its
successful implementation among SMMânamely, SMM living with HIV, HIV-negative SMM, and HIV care
providers. To do so, Study 1 (Aims 1 and 2) will leverage two LITE cohorts to recruit 250 SMM newly
diagnosed with HIV during the course of the studiesâwe will follow these men for two years immediately
following diagnosis, collecting home-based dried blood spot for VL on a monthly basis to examine the dynamic
nature of VL suppression. In addition to VL and self-reported data, the study will include objective indicators of
adherence and care engagement as well as qualitative interviews. The goal of Study 1 will be to identify risk
and resilience factors that influence VL suppression and can be used to guide future intervention development
(Aim 1) while simultaneously addressing understudied safety concerns of implementing U=U with regard to
unintended risks (Aim 2). In Study 2 (Aim 3), we will use focus groups conducted three times over five years to
inform implementation of U=U messaging. Achieving the aims of the proposed study will provide key insights
that will be critical for translating to or adapting interventions to enhance their potency and durability and
improve the health of SMM living with HIV and curb new infections."
10707886,"Respiratory complications account for significant morbidity and mortality in persons with cervical and high
thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI) due to their inability to cough. As a consequence, most individuals suffer from a
markedly reduced ability to clear airway secretions resulting in the development of recurrent respiratory tract
infections.1-16, 128-130,132,135,136 Moreover, diseases of the respiratory system are the leading cause of death in this
patient population.3,7,9,12,15 These individuals lack an effective cough mechanism due to paralysis of the muscles
of expiration.18-20,42,126-130,132,135,136 We have performed a pilot clinical trial (n=17) with disc electrodes and
demonstrated that an effective cough can be restored in SCI.27-29 This method results in near maximal expiratory
muscle activation, as reflected by the generation of large airway pressures and peak expiratory airflow rates,
which are in the same range as those observed during maximum cough efforts in normal persons.27,28 Use of the
system significantly reduces the difficulty in raising secretions and reduces the incidence of respiratory tract
infections29,117 Unfortunately, disc electrode placement requires an invasive surgical procedure. In a recent
clinical trial of bipolar SCS with parallel wire electrodes (T9âT11 spinal levels), we demonstrated that comparable
levels of expiratory muscle activation and clinical benefits can be achieved, when compared to the disc
electrodes (n=12).119,120,121a,153 Our current stimulation system entails use of wire electrodes manufactured by
Ardiem (Indiana, PA) and electrical stimulator by Finetech, Inc (London, England) (FM). FM however does not
have Bluetooth capability, has a cumbersome antenna and does not have a license to allow US
commercialization. Therefore, we plan to partner with Avery Biomedical Devices (Commack, NY) (ABD) to
construct more advanced and more user-friendly stimulator. The ABD device will have Bluetooth capability
allowing for remote activation and facilitate data logging including the ability to view, download and analyze data
in real time and the antenna is very flexible with no orientation requirement. In addition, ABD already services
patients with respiratory care needs. This stimulator will be used in conjunction with Ardiem wire electrodes,
utilized in our recent clinical trial. This device will represent the only commercially available spinal cord stimulator
with the range of stimulus parameters required to activate the expiratory muscles and restore an effective cough.
The Major Objectives of the proposed study, therefore, are to 1) construct an electrical stimulator to activate
the expiratory muscles and connect with the Ardiem electrodes 2) perform the necessary testing required by the
FDA to amend our current IDE 3) perform a multi-center clinical trial to determine the utility of SCS with wire
leads to produce an effective cough and provide an effective means of clearing airway secretions, reduce the
incidence of respiratory tract infections and improve subject quality of life in SCI and 4) meet the necessary
regulatory requirements to obtain FDA approval of the device for eventual commercialization. Ultimately, we
expect this technique to become an important clinical tool in the routine management of subjects with SCI.

The design of drug formulations is an essential part of pharmaceutical development to enable the safe and
effective delivery of medications. Unfortunately, formulation optimization is currently done using a trial-and-error
approach or by adhering to already established formulation strategies following a one-size-fits-all mindset. This
has resulted in formulations that are simple and only ensure appropriate physical properties such as shelf life
and liberation. Complex, targeted formulations can increase the safety and efficacy of medications, but such
systems are expensive to design, manufacture, and administer â limiting their broader deployment. Here, we
describe our goals to expand and augment our efforts in developing innovative machine learning methods and
integrate them with experimental workflows for the design of novel, targeted drug formulations. We will
specifically focus on the machine learning-guided design of (1) functional excipients that prevent microbiome
metabolism, (2) targeted self-assembling nanoparticles, and (3) tissue-selective prodrugs. Our machine learning
models will enable us to circumvent billions of otherwise necessary trial-and-error experiments by predicting the
most promising candidates for experimental validation. This allows us to systematically explore novel drug
delivery systems to identify better solutions that work best for specific medications and patients. Our focus on
functional excipients, self-assembled nanoparticles, and prodrugs will provide delivery solutions that are easier
to produce and deploy on a larger scale, thereby enhancing the impact of advanced drug delivery systems and
making medicine more equitable. Our in vitro and in vivo experiments will validate our predictions and provide
pre-clinical data for innovative drug delivery solutions positioned for further translation. We expect that our
platform will enable the rapid and effective design of advanced drug delivery solutions to create safer and more
efficacious therapeutics for every patient."
10591479,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
This proposed project will develop and make available to the scientific community the Latin American Biobank
of Severe Mental Illness (LAB-SMI). This resource, a databank and biobank (including DNA samples and both
phenotypic and genotypic data) for 50,000 individuals affected with SMI together with an equal number of
controls matched to the cases by age, gender, and geographical location will constitute a major step in reversing
the underrepresentation of Latin American populations in psychiatric genetics research. All of the participants
will be members of the âPaisaâ, a genetically and culturally homogenous population that is the predominant ethnic
group in a region of Colombia (CO) that is home to ~9M people. Cases will consist of individuals affected with
psychotic or mood disorders who will be ascertained, agnostic to diagnosis, through the electronic medical
records (EMR) of five large psychiatric hospitals in the âPaisa regionâ. Controls will be individuals without a history
of an SMI diagnosis who will be ascertained through the databases of SURA, one of the largest providers of
primary care services in this region. By extracting a wide range of information from the EMR, using methods
developed in an existing investigation of SMI in a single Paisa-region hospital, the project team will record lifetime
designations of an SMI diagnosis and the presence or absence of SMI-related symptoms (such as delusions)
and behaviors (such as suicide attempt). It is hypothesized that these phenotypic features may share genetic
causation that transcends diagnostic categories. SNP genotyping and whole exome sequencing studies of the
entire 100K LAB-SMI will be well powered to identify novel associations across the allele frequency spectrum for
SMI diagnoses, symptoms, and behaviors, and to help identify the causal variation responsible for previously
discovered associations. Additionally, the project will use the LAB-SMI databank to explore the architecture of
SMI phenotypes. Specifically, it will investigate the genetic basis of different disease trajectories, and mine the
full set of phenotype data for association with loci shown previously (through this project or others) to contribute
to SMI diagnoses, symptoms, or behaviors."
10917186,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Several factors contribute to FSUâs potential to create cultural transformation through an innovative
approach to hiring, supporting, and retaining URM faculty. First, our College of Medicine was founded in 2000
to train physicians to serve rural communities throughout the panhandle region and the State of Florida. Given
the racial and ethnic diversity of these areas, we have created a rich community-based network upon which to
integrate academic health-science efforts across our Colleges of Medicine, Nursing, and Arts and Sciences.
Second, in 2013, the Florida Board of Governors designated FSU as one of two ""preeminent universities""
which triggered an increased state commitment of $75 million from 2013 to 2018. FSU leadership invested
these funds to advance health-science research, including the creation
of the Equity Research Corner (a
consortium of eight centers and institutes) with the mission to address equity issues related to health, social,
and educational barriers at the levels of individuals, families, and communities
. Third, FSU has created
resources to support faculty conducting clinical translational research through our NIH-funded Clinical
Translational Science Award subaward. Fourth, FSU has committed in its Strategic Plan (Goal III) to
institutional change to foster diversity, inclusion, and equity at all levels and through the Presidentâs Task Force
of Anti-Racism, Equity, and Inclusion. We will leverage these resources to test the robustness of The
FLORIDA-FIRST BRIGADE for promoting a self-reinforcing community of scientists committed to
inclusive excellence. In response to RFA-RM-20-022, we propose three specific aims for the Overall Core:
 Aim 1. Achieve significant and sustainable cultural change at FSU to ensure inclusive excellence and
diversity at the macro (institutional), meso (hiring unit/Center/department), and micro (faculty) levels.
 Aim 2. Recruit, hire, and retain 6 new URM faculty within the clusters of chronic disease prevention and
management or mental health to form The FIRST Cohort as a replicable model for promoting diversity, equity,
and inclusive excellence in health-science research at FSU.
 Aim 3. Develop and implement a systems-levels approach (macro, meso, micro) to establish individual
research and career development plans and mentorship plans for each member of The FIRST Cohort.
 By recalibrating the standard institutional practices for URM faculty recruitment, development, and
retention, The FLORIDA-FIRST BRIGADE has the potential to promote diversity and inclusive excellence1 for
The FIRST Cohort and serve as an innovative model for the next generation of FSU health-science faculty."
10571818,"Impact of repeated vaccination on the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines
Summary
 Influenza viruses cause pandemic and seasonal outbreaks that lead to the loss of thousands to millions of
human lives. Vaccination is the best option for preventing influenza outbreaks and minimizing their effects on
health. In the United States, annual influenza vaccination has been recommended since 2010 for persons 6
months of age and older. However, vaccine performance varies significantly between influenza seasons, and
reduced vaccine effectiveness has been observed. Studies have reported that persons vaccinated during two
consecutive influenza seasons had lower vaccine effectiveness during the second season than persons who
had not been vaccinated during the prior season. These findings have caused profound confusion among the
public regarding the potential benefit of annual influenza vaccination. Thus, there is a critical need to address
the effect of repeated vaccinationâassociated pre-existing immunity on influenza vaccine performance.
 The objective of this project is to characterize the effects of repeated influenza vaccination on the specificity
and magnitude of cross-reactive antibodies and on the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines. Two
specific aims are proposed: 1) determine the specificity, magnitude, and longitudinal patterns of humoral
responses in humans with repeated seasonal vaccination, and 2) test the effect of repeated vaccinationâ
associated pre-existing immunity on influenza vaccine performance in ferrets.
 By comparing antibodies in persons with and without repeated influenza vaccination, we expect to show
whether and how pre-existing immunity achieved through repeated influenza vaccination affects the specificity
and magnitude of the cross-reactivity for the resulting antibodies and, thus, vaccine effectiveness. From our
studies in ferrets, we expect to show whether and how variations in repeated vaccinationâassociated pre-
existing immunity affect influenza vaccine performance. This study will expand our understanding of molecular
mechanisms that may influence how repeated vaccination affects influenza vaccine performance. Thus, this
study will provide basic knowledge for evaluating the need for annual influenza vaccination and for optimizing
influenza vaccine performance."
10814784,"Project summary
In contract to sexual organisms, the mechanisms of population genetics in bacteria are far less
understood. Two fundamental aspects of bacterial population genetics remain sorely
understudied: i) the impact of DNA exchange on the evolution of bacterial genomes and
populations is largely unknown. ii) the prominence of adaptive evolution has not been
comprehensively assessed in bacteria. Determining how recombination and adaptive evolution
impact bacteria is key to understand the biology of these organisms and to develop relevant
models of their evolution. Although bacteria reproduce clonally, there is increasing evidence that
the vast majority of these organisms are capable of homologous recombination by exchanging
pieces of DNA in a process similar to gene conversion in animals and plants. This process
enhances microbial capacity to adapt to stresses or changing environments and the exchange of
DNA between bacterial strains is a major concern for human health as exemplified by the
transfer of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. Despite the central role of this process, the
rates and patterns of recombination remain unresolved in bacteria. The extent of recombination
often varies greatly from one study to another and, as a result, the same bacterial species can
be perceived as clonal in one study and highly recombining in another. In this project, we
propose to re-evaluate the landscape of recombination rates and patterns along the genomes of
hundreds of bacterial species. Using new methodological frameworks based on Approximate
Bayesian Computation and Deep Learning, we will identify the factors shaping the variation in
recombination rate across bacteria. We will also uncover recombination rate variation across
bacterial chromosomes (i.e. hot spots and cold spots). Our rate estimates will also allow us to
study how recombination drives the evolution of genomic architecture of bacteria, including
turnover in gene content. Finally, we will quantify the impact of adaptive evolution in bacteria,
which may be substantially larger than in other organisms due to large bacterial effective
population sizes. We will also investigate the relationship between adaptation and
recombination, and identify the genes/pathways responsible for adaptation. In summary, this
study will evaluate the rates and patterns of recombination across hundreds of species,
determine the factors driving the evolution of the recombination process, reveal the role of
adaptive evolution in bacteria, and the interplay between recombination and adaptation."
10927327,"SUMMARY
The barriers to research and career success for underrepresented groups in academic medicine have been
widely documentedâan inhospitable climate, discriminatory policies, lower financial compensation, lack of
leadership opportunities, a sense of marginalization, and racism, among others. Strategies to eliminate these
barriers have been largely unsuccessful as evidenced by the persistent ârepresentation gap.â Research suggests
that while strategies focused on individuals are useful, an integrated approach will be necessary to effect
systemic change. Efforts toward inclusive excellence are underway at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount
Sinai (ISMMS) with such transformative initiatives as the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) Task Force to
Address Racism; a novel recruitment program to attract junior and senior Black/AA and Latinx faculty (The
Biomedical Laureates Program); creation of the Office for Gender Equity; establishment of the Institute for Health
Equity Research; and launch of The Center for Scientific Diversity. The purpose of the proposed FIRST Cohort
program is to accelerate inclusive excellence at our institution and, by extension, contribute to accelerating
inclusive excellence more broadly in the national biomedical research enterprise. Building on current initiatives,
our goals are to (1) foster sustainable culture/climate change; (2) promote inclusive excellence by hiring a diverse
cohort of new early-career faculty; and (3) support faculty development, mentoring, sponsorship, and promotion.
Our primary outcome is for FIRST Cohort faculty hires to secure an NIH R-award by the conclusion of the grant
period. We will pursue three related aims. First, we will modify the MSHS Task Force To Address Racism
Roadmap for Change with key strategies as the basis for an ISMMS Roadmap for Inclusive Excellence to include
(1) development of a process to collect accurate, comprehensive demographic faculty data and to make this
data accessible; (2) engagement of the faculty in regular climate surveys and the sharing of results with faculty
and institutional leaders; (3) departmental/Institute level review of advancement & promotion practices, policies,
and processes; among other key strategies. Second, we will recruit a diverse Cohort comprised of 4 clusters of
3 faculty per cluster to be embedded within our interdisciplinary Institutes. We will develop a new recruitment
protocol to ensure fairness and equity in the hiring process, require bias reduction training for search committee
members, and establish standardized interview processes. Next, we will provide an integrated program of faculty
development to include both career advancement and professional development activities (e.g., individual
development plans, mentor/sponsor committees, Grants-in-Progress workshops, individual coaching around
such issues as work-life integration, peer mentoring, etc.) Cluster Sponsors will lead the way in identifying
opportunities for formal and informal networking across the ISMMS and in the larger scientific community. With
the support of an institutional investment, all FIRST Cohort faculty will be retained at the conclusion of the award
period. We will conduct a rigorous evaluation of the program and collaborate closely with NIH CEC as required."
10599190,"Limited recovery of function after stroke remains a major problem for millions. Disability persists in
many, especially when hand function is limited. Existing therapies are limited and many have difficulties with
activities of daily living, even after rehabilitation. Electrical stimulation of the brain has been proposed and
used in early studies to try and aid recovery. In animals, stimulation delivered to the brain at precise times may
improve the effect of stimulation. By stimulating at the beginning of movements, or just after another part of
the brain is active, recovery may be enhanced.
 We will use recent advances in implanted brain stimulator technology to place wires on the brain
surface in patients who are recovering from stroke. We will stimulate the brain during therapy sessions.
Healthier brain regions near the stroke area will be stimulated at the time of activity of brain regions right over
the stroke. This will allow the two areas to strengthen their connection and improve the effect of therapy.
 We will measure motor function before and after these different stimulation patterns. This will establish
the ability to perform these experiments safely, and show that patients can tolerate well these painless
stimulation sessions. We will look at the strength of connections between brain regions and study the brain
networks related to motor function. We believe these connections and networks will become stronger with
brain stimulation. If successful, this preliminary study would offer a new form of treatment for stroke recovery."
10927340,"The overarching goal of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)/Tuskegee University (TU)
Faculty Institutional Recruitment for Sustainable Transformation (FIRST) Partnership is to create systemic and
sustainable culture change to further support inclusive excellence in research at both institutions. Within our
theme of Health Disparities, we will build a community of scientists committed to inclusive excellence by
recruiting 12 early-career faculty committed to promoting diversity and inclusion and interested in addressing
health disparities. These faculty will be hired across 3-4 clusters representing areas of research strength and
opportunity across our institutions: cancer, obesity and diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neuroscience.
Program hires will be designated as Benjamin-Carver Scientists in honor of two barrier-breaking investigator
leaders â Regina Benjamin, MD and George Washington Carver. Our Scientists will be surrounded by a
comprehensive support infrastructure including sponsors, mentors, career coaches, institutional research
navigators, and professional development opportunities to help them mitigate the difficulties experienced by
new hires and accelerate the development of collaborative networks and peer support.
 We have targeted our activities and support mechanisms to ensure that they impact all levels of
influence in the Social Ecological Model including Individual, Interpersonal, Organizational, Community and
Policy. All levels are reflected in the following specific aims: 1) recruit and hire clusters of Benjamin-Carver
Scientists who are committed to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion in areas of shared research need
and support them by implementing individual career development plans, enhanced with scientific mentoring,
career coaching, and advocate sponsorship; 2) provide enhanced support for new faculty through an Office of
Integrated Research Support in which Research Navigators will help new faculty coordinate sponsor, mentor,
and career coaching support; connect new faculty to existing support resources; and assist new faculty with
logistic, fiscal, and regulatory matters related to proposal development and grants management; 3) provide
extended opportunities for professional development and networking, including a diverse and inclusive
Research Community Collaboratory to help faculty build a collaborative network of peers; 4) expand a series of
diversity and inclusion programs at both UAB and Tuskegee to help foster systemic and sustainable cultural
change; 5) institute changes to institutional policies and environment to support sustainable institutional culture
change, including initiatives to support diverse and inclusive hiring and retention; and 6) evaluate the UAB/TU
FIRST Partnership and work with the FIRST Coordination and Evaluation Center (CEC) to determine whether
this cohort and cluster design model of faculty hiring, sponsorship, continual mentoring, and professional
development, embedded within programs to create academic cultures of inclusive excellence produces
significant change in metrics of institutional culture."
10916164,"PROJECT 1: ABSTRACT
CTL infiltration of tumor microenvironments (TME) predicts prolonged survival of patients with colorectal
cancer (CRC). It also differentiates between the small subset of patients (<5%) with microsatellite instability-
high [MSI-H] CRC, who show high levels of intratumoral CTLs and respond to PD-1 blockade from the rest of
CRC patients who do not respond. Our preliminary data demonstrate that a) TLR3-based adjuvants induce
CTL-attracting chemokines selectively in tumor stroma, but not surrounding non-tumor tissues; b) that
combination of TLR3 ligands (such as rintatolimod) with IFNÎ± synergistically induce high levels of CTL-
attractants uniformly in all tumor lesions; and c) that inclusion of COX2 blockers enhances specificity of CKM in
promoting CTL attraction but suppressing Treg attraction. The three-component chemokine-modulatory
regimen (CKM rintatolimod, IFNÎ± celecoxib) enhanced intratumoral CTL accumulation, prolonged survival and
synergized with PD1- and PD-L1 blockers in inducing cures (> 150 day survival) in mice with i.p. MC38 tumors,
resistant to PD-1 blockade alone. We completed phase I evaluation of systemic (i.v) CKM in patients with liver-
metastatic CRC (NCT01545141), observing its very good tolerability and improved ratios of CTL-to-Treg
markers in TME (compared to our patients receiving standard care only). We propose to:
Aim 1. Evaluate the in-patient immunologic effectiveness of i.v.- administered CKM to promote local
CTL accumulation in liver-metastatic CRC lesions in phase IIa trial NCT03403634. Comparing pre- versus
post-treatment tumor biopsies of 12 patients with liver-metastatic CRC, we will test if systemic CKM will
abrogate the TME heterogeneity and uniformly increase CTL numbers in TMEs, but not in surrounding tissues.
Aim 2. Evaluate the immune and antitumor effects of sequential versus cyclic application of CKM and
PD1 blockade and the advantage of additional immunization for long-lasting anti-tumor benefit. In
preclinical studies, we will test the hypotheses that the CKM-attracted DCs, NK cells and T cells will a) promote
local and systemic tumor-specific immunity and b) will amplify the CKM-initiated intratumoral production of CTL
attractants in an IFNÎ³ and TNFÎ±-dependent mechanism, resulting in sustained conditioning of the TME for
continued antitumor activity of PD1 blockade, even in the absence of additional vaccination.
Aim 3. Perform a phase I/II trial to test the clinical activity of CKM combined with PD-1 blockade in
patients with microsatellite-stable (MSS) CRC. In phase I/II trial, we will evaluate the clinical efficacy (iORR;
iRESIST) of CKM/anti-PD-1treatment in 19 patients with MSS-CRC, traditionally resistant to immunotherapy.
Programmatic Role: The unique role of Project 1 is to evaluate the effectiveness, uniformity and tumor-
selectivity of systemically-applied CKM and develop CKM-based treatments with sustained anticancer effect.
Its success will provide us with a tool to extend the therapeutic benefit of immunotherapy to a particularly large
group of patients with MSS-CRC and other cancers currently non-responsive to checkpoint blockade."
10916166,"High numbers of CD8+ CTLs and low numbers of regulatory T(reg) cells in tumor microenvironments (TME)
predicts prolonged survival of ovarian cancer (OvCa) patients and the clinical effectiveness of PD-1 blockers in
other cancers. We observed strong synergy between TLR ligands, IFNÎ± and COX2 blockers in specifically
inducing the CTL-attracting chemokines, but suppressing Treg attractants in preclinical OvCa models.
Combination of rintatolimod (TLR3-ligand), IFNÎ± and celecoxib (chemokine-modulating regimen; CKM)
promoted accumulation of tumor-specific CTLs in mouse OvCa TME, and synergized with PD-1 blockade in
mice with PD-1 resistant ID8 tumors, resulting in long-term (>100 days) survival in 50% of the animals. We
initiated a phase I/II trial (NCT02432378) to test if local (i.p.) rintatolimod/IFNÎ± is safe and effective in guiding
Î±DC1 vaccine-induced CXCR3+/CCR5+ CTLs to OvCa TME. We observed good tolerability of i.p. CKM and
local elevation of CD8, PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2. We also observed that CKM-attracted CTLs and NK cells
induce two separate (PD-1/PD-L1- and COX2-dependent), pathways of âsecondaryâ immune suppression,
providing rationale for their simultaneous targeting to achieve long-lasting therapeutic effects. We propose to:
Aim 1: Determine the safety of i.p-administered CKM and its effectiveness in promoting local
accumulation of CTLs in the TME of Î±DC1-vaccinated OvCa patients. Patients on phase II of
NCT02432378 will receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy and Î±DC1 vaccination, with or without local (i.p.) CKM.
We will evaluate the impact of i.p. CKM on the magnitude and duration of local CTL influx. We will obtain
preliminary data on potential clinical impact of the CKM/Î±DC1-vaccine treatment on PFS and OS.
Aim 2: Determine the mechanism of induction of âsecondaryâ suppression in human OvCa TME in
response to immune attack. We will test the hypothesis that CKM preferentially attracts CTLs, NK & Th1
cells (vs. MDSCs & Tregs), but that IFNÎ³/TNFÎ±-production by these effector cells triggers two independent
pathways of âsecondaryâ suppression, mediated by PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 system and COX2/PGE2-system.
Aim 3: Determine whether simultaneous targeting of PD-1 and COX2 results in sustained therapeutic
effects of Î±DC1 vaccines. We will test if Î±DC1/CKM-activated CTLs activated PD-1/PD-L1 and COX2/PGE2-
pathways in OvCa-bearing mice and if their complementary targeting results in therapeutic synergy. Guided by
these results, we will finalize the design and will test if Î±DC1[tumor]/(CKM combined with PD-1 blockade will
induce objective clinical responses (iRECIST) in patients with unresectable OvCa.
Programmatic Role: The unique role of Project 2 is to evaluate the longitudinal effects of locally-administered
CKM, interplay between vaccination, CKM and PD-1 blockade, and the roles of the PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 system
vs. COX2/PGE2 systems, as complementary mediators of âsecondary suppressionâ in TME."
10916167,"ABSTRACT
Chemokines (CK) play critical roles in the recruitment of immune cells into cancer tissues. Progressing tumors
are commonly characterized by local production of regulatory chemokines (CKs) and suppressor cells, while
production of pro-inflammatory CKs recruits protective CTLs and Th1 cells, dendritic cells (DC) and NK cells into
the tumor microenvironment (TME) in association with effective (immuno)therapeutic intervention. We have
recently shown that a combination vaccine targeting tumor vascular antigens (TVA) promotes specific CD8+ T
cell responses and the coordinate upregulation of stromal CCL5/CXCL9-11 production and therapeutic T cell
infiltration, and reduction in CCL22/CXCL12 production and MDSC/Treg content in the TME. Treatment also
promotes de novo production of CCR7-ligand CKs CCL19/CCL21 in the TME, and the development of tertiary
lymphoid-like structures (TLS). Remarkably, an autologous Î±DC1/TVA peptide-based vaccine administered with
dasatinib to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-refractory patients with advanced-stage melanoma
(NCT01876212) resulted in objective clinical benefit in 6 of 13 (46%) evaluable patients overall, including 4 of 7
(57%) patients exhibiting primary resistance to anti-PD1 blockade therapy. TCRBseq analyses revealed
increased TCR convergence (i.e. immune focus) in the therapy-induced TIL repertoire in advance of objective
clinical response. Furthermore, clinical responders exhibited unique TIL clonotypes post-treatment that were not
detectable in blood, supporting the TME as a relevant site for treatment-dependent T cell cross-priming and
âepitope spreadingâ. Since new preliminary data in murine B16 melanoma models suggests that therapeutic
efficacy of Î±DC1/TBVA-based vaccines is superior when combined with the Project 1-developed CK modulation
(CKM) regimen vs. dasatinib, Project 3, we will test the hypothesis that therapeutic benefits resulting from
Î±DC1/vascular peptide-based immunotherapy in immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-refractory, advanced-stage
melanoma patients will be increased when combined with chemokine-modulating regimens (including CKM),
Specifically, we will perform a Phase I/II trial of Type-1-polarized dendritic cell (Î±DC1)/TVA peptide vaccination
in combination with tumor-selective chemokine modulation (CKM: Interferon-Î±2b, Rintatolimod and Celecoxib)
in advanced-stage HLA-A2+ melanoma patients with primary PD-1/PD-L1 resistance (Aim 1) and analyze the
on-treatment changes in TME and blood of patients to determine clinically-relevant changes in immunological
analytes (Aim 2). Animal modeling will then be performed to determine the role of vaccine format in the
therapeutic efficacy of combination CKM-based immunotherapy +/- immune regulatory antagonists (Aim 3)."

cGMP guidelines; c) Characterization, release and delivery of DC vaccines for the clinical trials; and d) Continued
improvement of the process of DC production, testing, preservation, and distribution, to enhance the potency of
the cellular products, streamline the process and limit the costs.
Aim 3: Immune monitoring and cell analyses. Core C3 will provide: a) Procurement, triage and processing of
human blood specimens for use in laboratory studies associated with this Program; b) Monitoring patientsâ
systemic (blood) immunologic responses in clinical trials; and c) (Developmental) Identification of the most
relevant biomarkers (blood and biomarkers of the individual DC vaccines) predictive of clinical responses.
Programmatic Role and Interactions. Core C will support the timely completion of the three clinical trials proposes
in years 1-3, coordinated analysis of their (local and clinical) efficacy and potential side effects (with Cores B and
D). Based on these data and results of laboratory studies from all three projects, in year 3, Core C will help to
finalize the designs of the clinical trials proposed in SA3s of Projects 1 and 2 (combinations with PD-1 blockade),
their approval and implementation. In years 3-5, Core C will support the completion of these trials, coordinated
analysis of their clinical efficacy and identification of the relevant laboratory correlates."

Core D (Pathology and Bio-Imaging Core), directed by Dr. Morrison, MD, will support this clinically oriented
Program by providing comprehensive state-of-the-art evaluation of the immune status of tumor
microenvironments (TME), using cutting-edge platforms for comprehensive immune profiling, cell and tissue
analysis, imaging and image-analysis. Core D includes the following Aims:
Aim 1: Provide infrastructure to collect, process, annotate and archive tumor samples and evaluate the
immune status of the TME using comprehensive immune profiling. Our Tissue Procurement Service will
help collect fresh, frozen and FFPE tumor specimens from the clinical trials of this Program and tissue banking
protocols. OmniSeq and multiplex IHC subcore, will perform immunologic, genomic, and transcriptomic
assessment of the immune status of the TME, using CLIA-certified Immune Report Cardâ¢ (IRC), to determine:
1) transcript levels of 384 immune genes, 2) mutational burden of each tumor, 3) microsatellite instability, and
4) copy number gain of PD-L1 and PD-L2. We will also evaluate 5) on-treatment changes in TCR beta
repertoire, to evaluate evidence of tumor-specific T cell response in the TME and 6) Patterns of expression of
PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 system and COX2 system in relation to T cell infiltrate and clinical outcomes.
Aim 2: Provide state-of-the-art immuno-fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry services to interrogate
the spatial effects of chemokine modulating agents on immune cell influx, effector- and immuno-suppressive
mechanisms in the TME. It will provide state-of-the-art multicolor flow and imaging cytometry, confocal laser
scanning and multicolor fluorescence microscopy, combined with computer morphometry and image analysis.
Aim 3 (Sub-Core D3): Perform small animal live imaging to determine the kinetics of tumor growth
(bioluminescence) in differentially-treated mice and the kinetics of CTL traffic and accumulation in TME.
Programmatic Role and Interactions. With Projects 1, 2 and 3 we will evaluate immune profiles of human
colorectal, ovarian and melanoma tumors in the course of patient treatment with chemokine-modulating
regimens and/or DC vaccines; determine changes in density, clonality and distribution of CTLs and other
immune cells in human and mouse tumors treated by CKM in the absence and presence of vaccination and
PD-1 blockade, and determine growth kinetics of the differentially treated and non-treated tumors in murine
models. We will also determine the impact of treatments on vascular normalization; and formation of tumor-
associated lymphoid structures implicated in epitope spreading and long term-treatment effects. Core D will
interact with Core A for prioritization of services, with Core B to assure that proper design of studies and sound
statistical evaluation of the results. We will work closely with Core C to ensure failsafe procurement of all
specimens from the clinical trials, samples annotation and evaluation in context of clinical outcomes."

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) which are multifactorial complex disorders characterized by communication
deficits and repetitive behaviors affect between 1 and 2% of children in the US and Canada. Air pollutants,
phthalates, and pesticides are suspected of contributing to the etiology of ASD, whereas folic acid
supplementation has been shown to play a protective role, particularly in genetically susceptible individuals
with inefficient folate metabolism. Despite these critical findings from a few studies, several questions remain
unanswered: 1) No previous study investigated these modifiable factors in a comprehensive way; 2) no
previous study investigated the critical windows of susceptibility to these exposures; and 3) the interplay
between environmental, nutritional, and genetic factors in the etiology of autism is still unclear. Our preliminary
data show that folic acid supplementation is associated with lower autistic traits, but only in children of mothers
with genetic susceptibility. In addition, we found that adequate folic acid supplementation in first trimester of
pregnancy may prevent the detrimental effects of phthalates exposures regarding autistic traits. Building on
these findings and a large comprehensively characterized pregnancy and birth cohort implemented in ten
Canadian cities, we will examine the individual and joint contribution of identified modifiable risk factors of
autism and its associated traits. We will measure phthalates and organophosphate pesticides across the three
trimesters of pregnancy, and we will estimate monthly exposures to individual air pollutants such as nitrogen
dioxide and particulate matter and its composition across pregnancy and during childâs first year. Additionally,
we will measure folate autoantibodies that have been shown to be highly prevalent in mothers of autistic
children, and folate levels in maternal blood sample during 1st and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. Using
sophisticated statistical models that can take into account complex mixtures of pollutants and time-varying
exposures, we will 1) quantify the individual and cumulative effects of early exposure to multiple air pollutants,
phthalates, and organophosphate pesticides on autistic traits; 2) identify whether these contaminants are
associated with lower plasma folate levels in pregnant women; and 3) clarify the role of folate-related genetic
polymorphisms, folate autoantibodies, and plasma folate in the associations between environmental
contaminants and autistic traits. By answering these research questions, we will gain a better understanding of
how strongly multiple pollutants and folic acid supplementation are associated with autistic traits, whether
these chemicals are associated with circulating folate concentrations, and how these effects of multiple
pollutants differ based on folic acid intake, genetic susceptibility, and the presence folate autoantibodies.
These findings will have great clinical and public health implications and will be critical in informing better
prevention strategies both at the individual and population level."

 Similar to other Western U.S. cities, air quality in Reno, NV is routinely impacted by smoke from wildland fires. Smoke
plumes contain complex air pollutant mixtures, and their aerosol composition is governed by several factors. These
factors include aging, in which secondary organic aerosols are formed when biomass burning emissions undergo
atmospheric oxidation, and fuel type (i.e., the type of vegetation burned). Residents throughout the West are also
exposed to smoke from prescribed burns, which are used by land managers to mitigate wildfire risks. Due to their lower
intensity, prescribed burns are more likely to smolder, and emissions from smoldering fires differ from those of flaming
fires. To model the aerosol composition of smoke plume mixtures in the West requires detailed emissions information
from regionally relevant fuels, accurate characterization of aerosol aging, and consideration of differences between low
intensity prescribed burns and flaming wildfires.
 In 2006, the major health care provider in Reno (Renown Health) transitioned to electronic medical records (EMRs).
At present, this database contains information on over 1.4 million patient visits. This resource, combined with Renoâs
frequent exposure to smoke from fires that originate from ecosystems impacting many major Western U.S. cities, make
Reno an opportune setting to investigate associations between smoke plume mixtures and population health.
 Our proposed study has two overarching goals. 1) We will improve smoke exposure modeling in the West for use in
public health applications. We will create a new, innovative air quality model that will be the first to use tailored
emissions information from regional biomass fuels to model smoke plume mixtures, which will vary according to the
ecosystem of origin, atmospheric aging, and fire intensity (low intensity prescribed burns vs. flaming wildfires). 2) We
will advance understanding of the acute population-level health effects of smoke exposures. We will perform an
epidemiologic investigation using the Renown EMRs, considering overall associations and potential heterogeneity by
smoke plume mixtures. We will estimate associations of smoke exposures with four broad categories of health
outcomes (acute upper airway disease, acute lower airway disease, acute cardiovascular disease, and maternal blood
pressure) and with specific acute conditions of a priori interest within these categories (i.e., asthma, bronchitis, COPD
exacerbation, pneumonia, congestive heart failure exacerbation, ischemic stroke, and myocardial infarction).
 Anticipated outcomes include improving our ability to model smoke plume mixtures for biomass burning events that
impact millions of Americans annually and are projected to increase in the future. We will provide the first health
association estimates for prescribed burns, which will be of immediate use to land managers and other stakeholders in
the natural resources and public policy arenas. We will also provide the first estimates of potential heterogeneity in
population health outcomes by smoke plume mixtures. Longer-term, our study will help to inform the development of
more accurate, evidence-based public health warning systems."

Breast cancer (BC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of
cancer mortality among women in the US (ACS, 2017). High baseline prevalence, increasing
screening rates, and better treatments have all contributed to a large population of BC survivors
that will increase from an estimated 3.5 million in 2016 to a projected 4.5 million in the next 10
years (ACS, 2017). Multiple studies document fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) as a top long-
term concern of both cancer survivors and their significant others that impacts on quality of life.
Despite an increasing emphasis on FCR in the literature, a critical gap in knowledge is how FCR
can produce health behavior consequences with known implications for long-term health
outcomes. The overall objective of this proposal is to examine medication adherence, physical
activity/sedentary behavior, and sleep as three proximal health behavior outcomes that are
modifiable and have been linked to recurrence (for patients) as well as morbidity and mortality
(for both patients and spouses/partners). Moreover, FCR and health behaviors are concordant
within-couple reflecting an interdependent and interpersonal context that, if ignored, would limit
a complete understanding of important health consequences of FCR. Preliminary data from a
recently completed NCI-funded R21 project form the scientific premise and the basis of power
analyses for the specific and exploratory aims. Using longitudinal, within-person methods as
well as individual and dyadic multilevel structural equation modeling, we will pursue the
following hypothesis-driven aims: 1) identify the consequences of FCR for physical activity; 2)
identify the consequences of FCR for adherence to adjuvant hormonal treatment; and 3) identify
the consequences of FCR for sleep quantity and quality. Finally, using biomarkers of cardio-
metabolic health risk (i.e., HbA1c, lipids, insulin resistance, body composition), we will explore
the links between the targeted health behaviors and these health outcomes. A long-term
objective of the proposed work is to influence the development and refinement of interventions
for FCR and health behaviors ultimately increasing optimal mental and physical well-being of
cancer survivors and their spouses/partners."
11013635,"ABSTRACT. Liver tumors represent the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the world. Surgery (resection or
transplant) have formed the historical basis for treating hepatic tumors with intent to cure. However, advanced disease
staging at diagnosis (including intra- and extra-hepatic metastatic disease), a paucity of transplantable organs, underlying
hepatic pathology, intrahepatic tumor location, and extensive vascular involvement often contrive to limit surgical
intervention as viable options. Thermal ablation has emerged as an alternative to resection. While potentially curative, tumor
vascularization and location (relative to vital structures) often restricts thermal ablation to a subset of patients with liver
tumors. As a result, less than 25% of all patients diagnosed with hepatic tumors are amenable to existing treatment with
intent to cure, and five-year survival rates (15-25%) have remained largely unchanged over the last three decades.
 Innovative approaches are required to develop new treatment options for those diagnosed with liver tumors. Irreversible
electroporation (IRE) is an alternative to thermal ablation, whereby rapid electrical pulses are delivered between electrodes
placed in or around the tumor. The electric field generated during IRE delivery leads to formation of permanent cell
membrane defects that render cells incapable of regulating normal homeostasis and induces cell death. Because IRE induces
minimal thermal necrosis or tissue devitalization, IRE offers the advantage of sparing the structural integrity of the
underlying tissue architecture. However, clinical and technical complexities associated with existing IRE means it has been
slow to be adopted clinically.
 We have developed a novel high-frequency IRE (HFIRE) system that overcomes many of the technical challenges
associated with IRE by delivering ultrashort, bipolar electrical pulses. However, the HFIRE system does not overcome the
clinical challenge of requiring multiple electrodes to be placed in a challenging anatomic environment or the inability to
accurately monitor ablation progress in real-time. This led us to hypothesize that creating a single needle-dual electrode
HFIRE (SN-HFIRE) delivery platform will directly enable development of this technology to selectively treat hepatic tumors
not amenable to resection or thermal ablation. To test this hypothesis three Aims are proposed. Aim 1 Will employ a novel
ex vivo machine perfused liver model to test the functionality of existing SN-HFIRE devices, and to develop and evaluate
novel SN-HFIRE devices incorporating thermally-mitigating materials for HFIRE delivery. These studies will be performed
in conjunction with real-time measurement of tissue-ablation properties; Aim 2 Will define the clinical potential of SN-
HFIRE in the complex in vivo environment using acute and chronic large animal (swine) liver models; Aim 3 will establish
the clinical viability of SN-HFIRE by treating canine HCC patients using a treat-and-resect protocol. The proposed
approaches will build on the technical and clinical expertise of the research groups assembled to develop an innovative,
translational approach to treating and managing those diagnosed with untreatable hepatic tumors, while simultaneously
creating a novel ablation technology that is readily adaptable for treating other, inoperable solid tumors."
10540803,"Abstract
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting CD19 are highly effective in children with
refractory/relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), including those with primary
refractory or CNS disease. Current CAR T cell therapies infuse patients with T cells
constitutively expressing CARs, which are not susceptible to any controllable regulation.
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and CAR-associated neurotoxicity (CAN), both of which
can be fatal, arise from uncontrolled CAR T cell activation and expansion. While a few
pharmacological management approaches have been attempted to overcome this issue, they
are often suboptimal. In addition, chronic B-cell aplasia from persistent CD19 CAR T cells
requires monthly infusions of immunoglobulin, which is burdensome and expensive, especially
for pediatric patients facing potentially a lifetime need. Here, we propose to develop a system
for controllable CAR T cells that can be turned on and off as needed. We have previously
demonstrated that exogenous expression of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 acts as a
negative regulator to dampen T cell activation. Recently, we have developed an inducible and
reversible protein degradation system for SHP-1 by adapting the plant Auxin-induced degron
(AID) system for T cells. Combining these two tools in Aim 1, we propose to develop CD19
CAR T cells that will be kept basally dormant through overexpression of SHP-1. However,
upon administration of Auxin, the CAR T cells can be temporarily and reversibly activated
through the degradation of SHP-1. As the doses of Auxin sufficient to activate the AID system
had no significant toxicities in humans, we do not foresee a problem translating this system
into the clinic. In Aim 2, we will examine the efficacy of this novel CAR T cell system in a murine
model of ALL. In Aim 3, we will expand the studies to test whether this regulatable CAR T cells
system can control and/or limit CAR T cell-associated toxicities using a muring model of ALL,
CRS and neurotoxicity. Such an exogenously regulatable CAR T cell system may provide
clinicians a tool to avoid/limit severe CRS and CAN, and allow repopulation of the B-cell
compartment after a sufficient treatment course. This approach will greatly enhance the safety
of CD19 CAR T cells and is likely applicable to CARs for other malignancies, including solid
tumors, where on-target, off-tissue cytotoxicity is more problematic."
10890573,"This application would renew support for the BP-ENDURE program in St. Louis to train undergraduate students underrepresented in the neurosciences. The objective of the grant is to provide rigorous and critical training in neuroscience to a diverse cohort of students from three partner institutions: Washington University, the University of Missouri-St. Louis and Harris-Stowe State University. By supporting 8 new students per year over two years of research, education, and networking experiences, this proposal will establish a Pipeline to graduate school. The Pipeline emphasizes sustained training in oral and written science communication, discovery science and outreach experience. We seek to be a Program that responds to changes in the research environment by helping our students to pursue important and innovative problems and concepts, to adopt new techniques and to communicate effectively with their peers and the general public. The training will create a community of young neuroscientists through three interactive and immersive courses, full-time summer and part-time academic year research in a neuroscience lab matched to the studentâs interests and background, and presentations at conferences. The Pipeline provides intensive workshops for mentors. The curriculum and research environments will remain broad and deep, combining expertise in molecular, cellular and systems-level approaches to the study of neural function and dysfunction. Major new initiatives aimed at accomplishing these goals include: 1) creation of a new course at our Partner Institutions to develop the network of future researchers, 2) the introduction of ENDURE-ing Synapses, a course to bolster neuroscience fundamentals, literature reading and presentation skills and a sense of community among the students, 3) mentoring experiences for undergraduates in the Society for Neuroscience Brain Bee as part of their training in science communication, and 4) refinement of a near peer-mentoring program that has graduate students working with undergraduates and undergraduates working with high school students. These initiatives will ensure our students remain at the forefront of developments in neuroscience research, teaching and outreach."
10903846,"Project Summary
In response to the RFA for a Cellular Cancer Biology Imaging Program we propose a program focused on
imaging and molecularly probing the cell biological events that drive the formation of new metastatic tumors.
Specifically, we will address two questions: 1) How does the intersection of shifts in cell-intrinsic and cell-
extrinsic signals associated with shifts in expression of the membrane adaptor protein Caveolin-1 affect the
metastatic propensity of pediatric sarcoma (Research Testbed Unit 1)? 2) What are the effects of cell-intrinsic
and cell-extrinsic variation in lipid metabolism on melanoma metastasis patterns (Research Testbed Unit 2)?
Answers to both questions depend on technology to capture the molecular, metabolic, and morphological
states of individual metastatic cells as they colonize the distant site: In the Technology Development Unit-1 we
will develop a multi-modal, multi-scale live imaging platform to investigate the effects of intersecting
microenvironmental variation across an organism and cell intrinsic heterogeneity on metastatic spreading. The
platform will leverage the exquisite optical and physiological properties of the zebrafish embryos to âwatchâ at
once how cells form human tumor xenografts spread to multiple distant sites where they form metastatic
tumors. The microscope will allow seamless switching between a high-throughput screening mode observing
the metastatic patterns in tens to hundreds of embryos in one experiment and a high-resolution imaging mode
with fully isotropic resolution of 300 nm in XYZ that allows detailed analysis of the molecular, metabolic,
morphologic, and proliferation/survival states of individual cells within an emerging metastatic niche. In the
Technology Development Unit-2 we will develop a multi-scale imaging platform to investigate by hyper-spectral
analysis the molecular, metabolic, morphological, and functional states of metastatic cells across entire mouse
organs. The platform will leverage advances in tissue clearing, fully automated high-speed and high-resolution
light-sheet fluorescence imaging, and computer vision, to integrate a mesoscopic imaging mode for fast
acquisition of volumes of up to 20 x 20 x 20 mm at a ~5-10 micron isotropic resolution with a nanoscopic
imaging mode providing 300 nm XYZ-resolution throughout a 300 micron field of view anywhere in the organ.
Biological features can thus be rapidly identified and immediately interrogated with high subcellular resolution.
We will then develop physically and chemically accelerated 60-plex cyclic immunofluorescence assays to
comprehensively characterize the molecular, metabolic and architectural states of colonizing cells and their
surroundings in the metastatic niche in thick (~200 microns) tissue sections. To accurately describe metastatic
heterogeneity, the entire system, including sample handling, labeling, and imaging, will be fully automated and
operated in a high-throughput fashion. Our goal with this system is to enable comprehensive profiling of
heterogeneous cell metastatic cell behavior in 100âs of intact tissue specimens. Together, these platforms will
generate versatile imaging tools for a new era of in situ cancer cell biology."
10818318,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Each year, 50M Americans suffer from chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and allergic rhinitis (AR). The
economic impact accounts for over $35B/year in health care expenditures alone, with over 3.5M work and 2M
school days lost each year. Accordingly, over 600K operations per year are performed to treat sinonasal disease.
The disease burden is immense with a profound reduction in quality of life, and is often overlooked because
mortality is low, while morbidity is high. Currently, patient-reported outcome measures are used to evaluate
disease status in CRS and AR, as there are no reliable quantitative methods to gauge disease severity or
response to therapy. Success or failure is determined by the subjective reports from the patient alone, or via
physician-directed endoscopy, where interpretation may also be subjective. One potential biophysical variable
that can be measured is ciliary beat frequency (CBF). The cilia control mucociliary transport, which is the
endpoint physiologic function of the sinonasal mucosa. CBF is challenging to measure in vivo in a clinical setting,
but has value in potentially monitoring mucosal health and the response to therapy.
 This proposal is in response to the PAR-19-158 NIBIB Bioengineering Research Grants and aimed to
develop and validate an innovative in vivo imaging system to measure CBF and the related physiological
parameters that characterize mucosal health. Drs. Chen and Wong have had continuous collaborations for over
20 years with expertise in optical imaging, system, and probe designs, as well as translating these bench-top
technologies to clinical applications. This proposal centers on the design, construction, and clinical evaluation
of phase-resolved spectrally encoded endoscopy (PR-SEE) integrated with optical coherence tomography
(OCT). PR-SEE will enable functional imaging of the nasal mucosa in vivo, allowing surveying the CBF
landscape across the nasal mucosa as well as facilitating the analysis of ciliary beat pattern (CBP). More
importantly, PR-SEE will provide a rigorous means to assess the speed, amplitude, and propagation of the
mucosal metachronal waves (MWs), which are the quantifiable endpoint function of mucociliary transport.
 The proposed imaging device concentrates on a coaxial scanning scheme encompassing spectrally
encoded interferometry and OCT to overcome the current limitations for in vivo cilia imaging. To evaluate and
validate our device, we will first perform PR-SEE on a rabbit nasal airway model, followed by imaging of
anesthetized patients in the operation room to obtain ciliary functional parameters (CBF, CBP, MWs). Sixty
subjects undergoing nasal operations (normal control, e.g., septoplasty) or sinus surgeries (CRS patients) will
be recruited for the study. Successful clinical translation in the operation room will prepare PR-SEE for imaging
awake patients in the office in subsequent studies. We firmly believe that enabling functional quantification of
mucosal health will jumpstart the developments in pharmacotherapy, devices, and surgical intervention."
10595586,"Tobacco and cannabis are commonly used together in the Veteran population and result in significant morbidity;
to date, however, advancements in medication development for this comorbidity have been limited. Varenicline,
a selective nicotinic nACH receptor partial agonist of the Î±4Î²2 subtype and a full agonist of the Î±7 subtype, is
arguably the most effective pharmacotherapy for promoting tobacco abstinence and has also shown promise for
the treatment of alcohol use disorder. Varenicline may improve cannabis use outcomes through multiple
mechanisms, including interaction with the mesolimbic dopamine system, enhancement of cognitive functioning,
and restoration of inhibitory control. Our pilot data also suggests that varenicline may be effective in improving
use outcomes in individuals who use both cannabis and tobacco. Given the prevalence of cannabis and tobacco
use disorder in Veterans, we propose to conduct a 12-week, placebo-controlled trial in 138 individuals to evaluate
the potential efficacy of varenicline in individuals with this comorbidity. Primary outcomes will be reduction in
cannabis and tobacco use, and exploratory analyses will examine retention in treatment."
10815840,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Immune-mediated adverse drug reactions (IM-ADRs) are a major obstacle to the successful treatment of both
HIV and tuberculosis (TB) internationally. Their contribution to management complexity and economic burden is
a particular problem in South Africa (SA) where 1 in 4 individuals in the population is HIV-infected and 1 in 5
patients with HIV develops a cutaneous adverse drug reaction during treatment. Stevens-Johnson syndrome
and toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)
are severe IM-ADRs that have mortalities that can exceed 40% and lead to prolonged hospitalization, higher
healthcare costs and significantly constricted treatment options. The specific effect that these IM-ADRs have on
HIV treatment outcomes has not been adequately measured. In addition, the IM-ADRs themselves are known
to be associated with significant long-term disability and physical and mental health complications that have not
been measured in HIV and HIV/TB co-infected populations. Preventive efforts for severe IM-ADRs such as
DRESS and SJS/TEN have been fueled by promising discoveries such as the strong association between the
HLA class I allele HLA-B*15:02 and carbamazepine SJS/TEN which has led to pre-treatment screening for HLA-
B*15:02 before carbamazepine prescription in some Southeast Asian countries. Members of our group were
responsible for the translation of HLA-B*57:01 screening to prevent abacavir hypersensitivity and we recently
described a strong association between HLA-C*04:01 and nevirapine SJS/TEN in SA suggesting that HLA class
I associations are also important for drugs used in the treatment and prevention of HIV. However, the genetic
risk factors for IM-ADRs in African HIV-infected populations are incompletely understood and there are significant
gaps in understanding the risk factors for IM-ADRs in drug commonly used in African HIV-TB co-infected
populations. In SA and other resource poor African settings, given the high burden of HIV and TB, there is an
urgent need to identify management strategies for IM-ADRs that will help improve prevention efforts, earlier
diagnosis and treatment protocols. Our hypothesis tested will be that we will identify HLA and other genetic
associations between SJS/TEN as well as DRESS and drugs used to prevent, treat and manage HIV and its co-
morbidities. In specific aim 1 we will create a biorepository of DNA and other samples from IM-ADR cases
related to drugs used to treat HIV and TB that includes underserviced areas in South Africa. Existing and
new IM-ADR cases will undergo specific phenotype validation and causality adjudication. In specific aim 2 we
will define HLA and other genetic risk factors associated with IM-ADRs in HIV/TB endemic settings. In
specific aim 3 we will determine short and long-term complications and outcomes amongst a cohort of
patients who have experienced IM-ADR and the specific impacts on HIV care. Using the synergistic gain of
an existing US-South African collaboration we predict that our discoveries will create a roadmap for the
prevention and management of IM-ADRs in complex HIV populations in resource poor settings internationally."
10623185,"People living with HIV infection (PLWH) are living longer but with advancing age experience
accelerated functional decline (decreased strength, slowed gait, reduced exercise tolerance) and increased
frailty, as compared to non-infected individuals. The syndromes of functional decline and frailty are associated
with impaired quality of life, increased vulnerability to superimposed stresses, and the likelihood of premature
morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms underlying this accelerated dysfunction and disability, however, are
poorly understood. The proposed project examines the contribution of altered skeletal muscle (SM)
mitochondrial function and high energy phosphate metabolism to the related, but distinct syndromes of fatigue,
exercise intolerance, and frailty often present in older PLWH. Considerable pre-clinical data and our pilot
clinical studies using a 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) fatigability test during and following lower-
extremity exercise suggest an âenergetic myopathyâ as a possible basis for the fatigue and decreased
performance in older PLWH individuals. However the extent, underlying responsible factors, and functional
significance of altered SM mitochondrial bioenergetics in this population have not been characterized. In
addition, two potential mechanisms responsible for altered SM high energy phosphate metabolism in other
populations, increased inflammation and SM lipid accumulation, have not been examined and related to
muscle energetics in PLWH and so these too will be examined. The central hypothesis is that impaired SM
mitochondrial energy metabolism, initiated by aging and accelerated in the setting of contemporary HIV, is a
central contributor to the geriatric syndromes of fatigue, exercise intolerance, and frailty in older PLWH. We
propose to use state-of-the art 31P MRS exercise testing, detailed muscle and whole body composition
measures, functional assessments during observed and free-living conditions, and biomarkers of inflammation
and immune activation in 200 older (age>=60) women and men derived from four local NIH-sponsored cohorts
to address these questions. The specific aims are 1) to define the scope of SM metabolic changes in older
women and men living with HIV, 2) to probe whether inflammation, skeletal fat and other underlying factors are
related to the energetic abnormalities in older PLWH and 3) to determine the functional significance of SM
energetic changes in older PLWH by examining the relationships between the energetic changes and exercise
tolerance and other functional assessments as well as the frailty phenotype. Fatigue, exercise intolerance, and
frailty are common in older PLWH and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood These novel,
timely studies will provide new insights and guide future intervention strategies designed to attenuate or
reverse mitochondrial and bioenergetic decline and thereby reduce the personal and societal toll of these
geriatric conditions in older women and men living with HIV."
10833460,"The ability to predict dependencies given the molecular features of a
patientâs tumor is central to cancer precision medicine. The systematic use of CRISPR/Cas9 and pharmacologic
tools in established cancer models is showing great potential to discover new targets. However, existing model
development approaches require long periods of culture time during which evolutionary pressures
reduce heterogeneity. And, it remains challenging to create long-term models for certain tumor types and
genotypes, making it challenging to use perturbational tools to experimentally map dependencies.
To address these challenges, our overarching goal is to develop ârapid ex vivo tumor biosensorsâ whereby
we would be able to interrogate cancer dependencies in an immediate short-term âcultureâ of cancer cells taken
from a patient biopsy/surgery/fluid collection as a novel research-grade experimental model of cancer. In doing
so, we aim to couple the timing of drug or CRISPR/Cas9 perturbation with the preservation of subcellular
heterogeneity. If successful, we hypothesize that this modelling approach will more accurately recapitulate
patient tumors and may ultimately serve as a stronger foundation for preclinical therapeutic studies. This work
should also substantially expand the fraction of patient samples that can be interrogated.
Here, we propose using gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) as a test case for this strategy due to our
experience as well as the existence of marked intra-tumor heterogeneity. However, once established, this novel
modeling platform should enable a wide range of basic and translational questions (both for GEA and other
tumors) that require model formats that include heterogeneous cell populations.
Our goal will be achieved via two Specific Aims including (1) using patient-derived organoids created on
rapid time frames for CRISPR/Cas9 editing to validate emerging GEA dependencies; and (2) developing the
ability to directly visualize and perturb single cells from matching patient ascites fluid or disaggregated primary
tumors ex vivo using label-free imaging methods. We will benchmark these approaches against each other using
the same clinically annotated, serially collected patient samples. In following the instructions for this RFP, we
focus on technology-development focused goals as opposed to deeper mechanistic studies. We focus on
benchmarking predictions and assessing reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity. This work is innovative, in
that it brings together expertise at the intersection of functional genomics, advanced computational approaches
for image-analysis and GEA genomics. If successful, this effort could have significant impact by establishing a
foundation to expand this approach to other disease (tumor and non-cancer) indications."
10808041,"SUMMARY
Positron emission tomography (PET) is widely used as a diagnostic molecular imaging technique and clearly
has had a significant impact on human healthcare. There have been significant improvements in PET technology
by employing time-of-flight (TOF) capability that measures the difference in arrival time of the two 511 keV
gamma annihilation rays. This TOF information spatially constrains the origin of the event, leading to improved
image quality due to the increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and effective sensitivity in the PET scan.
 The scintillator bismuth germanate (BGO), however, has several better properties for PET applications than
L(Y)SO, such as higher stopping power and higher photo-electric fraction. BGO also has no background activity
and can be produced at lower cost than L(Y)SO. However, a major drawback of BGO is the poor coincidence
timing resolution originating from the moderate light yield and slow decay time of scintillation photon production.
Therefore, BGO has not been considered for use in current generation TOF PET scanners.
 Theoretically, when a 511keV gamma ray interacts in a scintillator, a small number of optical Cerenkov photons
are produced promptly by energetic electrons released by photoelectric or Compton interactions. The Cerenkov
photons are produced within an extremely short time frame and earlier than scintillation photons, Thus the
Cerenkov photons should provide better timing information for PET. Interestingly, BGO has properties that lead
to it producing more Cerenkov photons than other scintillators.
 Recently, we showed, for the first time, the influence of prompt Cerenkov photons on the timing properties of
BGO using latest generation silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) developed by our partner FBK. Thus, our proposed
concept for BGO is that Cerenkov photons are used to obtain prompt timing information while scintillation photons
provide essential energy information for PET. The major goals of this proposal are i) to improve coincidence
timing resolution of BGO by detecting more Cerenkov photons for TOF PET applications, ii) to develop signal
reducing methods and read-out electronics for signals generated by both Cerenkov and scintillation photons,
and iii) to finally develop and evaluate the first practical BGO-based TOF PET detector modules, which have 5
Ã 5 cm2 cross-sectional area and a coincidence timing resolution of â¤300 ps FWHM. If successful, this proposal
forms the basis for developing novel BGO-based TOF PET scanners with higher sensitivity and lower cost than
current PET scanners."

All eukaryotes use phosphorylation-based signaling networks, composed of protein kinases and
phosphatases, to regulate cellular processes. While global information about kinase signaling has
exploded, knowledge of phosphatases has lagged behind. The lack of systematic, unbiased approaches
to analyze phosphatase signaling leaves a major gap in our understanding of cellular regulatory
networks. For >25 years, my research on calcineurin, the conserved Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated
phosphatase, in S. cerevisiae and humans has directly addressed this issue. Calcineurin is ubiquitously
expressed and plays critical regulatory roles in the cardiovascular, nervous and immune systems (1);
however, only ~70 proteins are currently established as calcineurin substrates (2). Calcineurin
dephosphorylates the Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (NFAT) transcription factors to activate the
adaptive immune response (3), and calcineurin inhibitors, FK506 and cyclosporin A, are commonly
prescribed as immunosuppressants (4). However, these drugs cause unwanted effects, including
hypertension, diabetes, and seizures by inhibiting calcineurin in non-immune tissues (5), highlighting the
need to map human calcineurin signaling pathways systematically. My work elucidates calcineurin
signaling through novel approaches based on the discovery of short linear motifs (SLiMs): short
degenerate peptide sequences found within regions of intrinsic disorder that determine specific, low-
affinity interactions that are essential for signaling (6). Using experimental and in silico SLiM-based
methods, we recently defined the human calcineurin signaling network (2). This work uncovered
conserved regulation of nuclear pore complexes by calcineurin and showed unexpected calcineurin
proximity to centrosomes (2). Future efforts will elucidate Ca2+ and calcineurin signaling at these
compartments using a combination of methods that include phosphoproteomics and proximity labeling
with faster-labeling biotin ligases (miniTurbo (33), Split TurboID). Fluorescent sensors will be used to
probe Ca2+ signals at these locations in vivo. Calcineurin functions at membranes will be analyzed by
focusing on CNb1, a little-studied isoform with distinct localization and regulation conferred by its unique,
lipidated C-terminal sequences (10). Regulation of CNb1 activity via dynamic palmitoylation will be
examined, and CNb1-specific signaling pathways, including regulation of PI4P synthesis, will be
established to achieve a comprehensive and mechanistic understanding of this enzyme. Finally, the
novel technology, MRBLE-PEP (Microspheres Ratiometric Barcode Lanthenide Encoding coupled to
PEPtides) (11), will be developed for quantitative analysis and discovery of SLiMs. Overall this research
aims to map human calcineurin signaling pathways systematically and to advance our understanding of
SLiM-based signaling more broadly."

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a critical role in fostering tumor resistance to therapies and relapse after
treatment. This presents a crucial barrier to the development of successful anti-cancer therapeutics.
Transcriptional reprogramming and plasticity play a critical role in and out of the CSC state, which in turn are
interdependent on the regulatory function of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of chromatin, epigenetic states,
and other molecular events. Our understanding of fundamental CSC biology has been hampered by the need
for cellular nanoscale imaging technologies that provide both highly detailed structural information regarding 3D
chromatin organization and highly multiplexed molecular imaging of the many molecular regulators and events
involved in CSC processes. We propose to establish the Northwestern University Center for Chromatin
Nanoimaging in Cancer (NU-CCNIC) to address this fundamental technology gap in cellular nanoscale imaging
and deploy the new technologies to address the fundamental knowledge gap in CSC biology. The Center
converges experts in cellular nanoscale imaging, computational imaging, molecular modeling, computational
genomics, CSC biology, and oncology. The Center will develop, test, validate, iterate, and deploy an integrated
and co-registered Multi-scale Chromatin Nanoimaging Platform that will comprise three ânested-dollâ imaging
techniques: chromatin scanning transmission electron microscopy, optical spectroscopic super-resolution
nanoscopy, and optical spectroscopic nanosensing. The Nanoimaging Platform will enable quantitative imaging
of chromatin structure and highly multiplexed molecular and gene-specific localization, at the most fundamental
length-scale approaching 1 nm resolution, including the imaging of statistically significant cell populations and
live cells with high temporal resolution over prolonged temporal follow-up times. The Nanoimaging Platform will
be bridged to computational genomics, epigenomics, genome mapping, and predictive transcriptional modeling
datasets. These technologies will be deployed to answer several long-standing open questions in CSC biology.
We will elucidate whether CSCs can originate from non-CSCs via transcriptional reprogramming, test the role of
chromatin structure in fostering transcriptional plasticity in CSC processes, and explore the possibility of
transcriptionally reprogramming CSCs to exit the stem-state as a new therapeutic strategy. All aspects of the
technology development will be guided by the needs of the CSC biology testbed through a series of research
feedback loops. In the long term, such single-cell nanoimaging technologies will help comprehensive
understanding of the complex interplay between structural, physico-chemical, and molecular genomic events.
We anticipate that these convergence studies will provide new insights into CSC biology, which are impossible
to reveal with the use of any single method, and open new opportunities for identifying therapeutic strategies."

The association between early inflammation and altered child neurobehavioral development is indisputable, but
understanding of neurological phenomena underlying this association is almost entirely lacking. Studies in
animals suggest that, even before birth, inflammation acts on developing neural connections to alter the course
of development. However, these critical associations remain to be tested in the human brain. Here, we will
examine prenatal inflammation, fetal neural programming effects, and child neurodevelopment in a unified
framework. We will leverage an existing longitudinal cohort to evaluate whether inflammation in the prenatal
period exerts influence over the developing fetal neural connectome, and subsequently increases risk for
childhood disorders. We will pair advances in fetal resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) MRI with
innovations in tooth-biomarker assays to address prenatal neural-immune interactions, and using advanced
modeling techniques will rigorously investigate protective and resilience factors in early life that mitigate
maladaptive childhood outcomes. To achieve these objectives, we will attain deciduous tooth samples from
children enrolled in a longitudinal neurodevelopmental protocol that included fetal brain RSFC MRI. A new
wave of data collection, partially harmonized with the NIHâs Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)
study protocol, will be conducted at age 9 and will include MRI on the same scanner used prenatally. In these
participants, associations between fetal systemic inflammation, fetal brain functional connectivity, and child
neurobehavioral development will be examined. Our technique involves high temporal resolution sampling of
five inflammatory markers, C reactive protein, Interleukin (IL) 1, 6, 10, TNF-a, across post conception week 15
through postnatal week 12, enabling isolation of sensitive periods and interactive effects. The primary aims of
this project are to (i) identify fetal brain connectome abnormalities associated with heightened prenatal
inflammation, (ii) characterize long-term brain and behavioral consequences of heightened prenatal
inflammation, and (iii) isolate protective factors in the postnatal environment that predict advantageous long-
term outcomes. We will thus be able to meaningfully evaluate whether and how prenatal inflammatory events
affect functional neurocircuitry of the developing fetal brain, and the long-term neurobehavioral consequences
of those associations. Such work would constitute a substantial advance in our understanding of not only the
long-term effects of prenatal inflammation, but also the origins of child neurological disorders."

Hernia repairs are one of the most common surgeries performed in the United States, with over 350,000
ventral hernia repairs (VHR) performed yearly. Beyond the high health care system expenditure on VHR,
patients report poor quality of life, post-operative pain, and time loss at work. Management traditionally
includes surgical restoration of the abdominal wall, and short-term physician follow-up to ensure surgical site
healing. Even once surgery has restored the abdominal wall, individuals post-operatively demonstrate major
impairments of the musculoskeletal system including poor strength and function which contributes to reduced
activities of daily living and a lower self-reported quality of life. Participation in physical therapy (PT) post-
operatively may directly address and improve overall strength, function, and post-operative pain, in turn
improving self-reported quality of life. There is a need to characterize recovery of function after VHR,
specifically with the addition of objective measures of function to standard of care. Notably, we do not know the
modifiable clinical characteristics of patients who will benefit the most from undergoing standardized post-
operative PT. As a step towards this, we must understand the patient- and surgery-specific factors linked to a
likelihood of a successful outcome following VHR. This mentored training plan will use data from a CMS
Qualified Clinical Data Registry and an NIH/NIDDK funded registry-based clinical trial to understand the
complex relationships between patient- and surgical-characteristics as they relate to post-operative function.
Findings from this fellowship will provide (1) robust predictive models to understand characteristics of patients
who have a good or poor self-reported quality of life 1 year after ventral hernia repair and (2) foundational
evidence in understanding treatment response to physical therapy using objective measures of function. This
fellowship proposes a paradigm shift of the current approach to hernia disease by considering objective and
patient-reported measures of function of as a primary post-operative outcome. Meeting the objectives of this
fellowship will afford the applicant the knowledge and skills required of an independent investigator and provide
requisite preparation for a faculty position at a research-intensive university."

 Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are biologically and environmentally persistent anthropogenic
chemicals. Over 98% of the U.S. population has detectable levels of PFAS in their blood (serum). People may
be exposed to PFAS through contaminated drinking water and food, house dust, or consumer products. Some
populations may experience additional PFAS exposures from their jobs or hobbies. PFAS are of public health
concern because of their associations with numerous adverse health outcomes including dyslipidemia, an
imbalance of blood lipids such as high cholesterol. Dyslipidemia is a primary risk factor for ischemic heart disease
(IHD), the leading cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the U.S. and globally.
 Volunteer firefighters are community members who fill a critical public safety function, particularly in suburban
and rural areas. Firefighters can be exposed to PFAS through combustion products, firefighting foams, and
firefighter protective clothing. The association between PFAS exposure and dyslipidemia is of major concern in
this population because cardiac events are the primary cause of line-of-duty deaths among all firefighters.
However, the extent and pathways of volunteer firefightersâ PFAS exposures, and the ways these exposures
may affect their blood lipid levels, are unknown. While 65% of the over 1 million U.S. firefighters are volunteers,
they are understudied, creating critical knowledge gaps in evidence-based efforts to protect and improve the
health of volunteer firefighters and the communities they serve.
 To address these gaps, we will leverage existing data from the Rutgers Firefighter Cancer Assessment and
Prevention Study (CAPS), a cohort of volunteer firefighters from 8 U.S. states. This F31 fellowship builds upon
the applicantâs preliminary work with CAPS data using pilot funding. Two specific aims will be used to achieve
the objectives of identifying (a) predictors of serum PFAS concentrations including sociodemographic,
firefighting, and occupational characteristics, and (b) associations between PFAS and lipid concentrations in
volunteer firefighters. Aim 1: Assess the seroprevalence, predictors, and possible exposure sources of
PFAS among U.S. volunteer firefighters. We hypothesize that heterogeneous distributions and concentrations
of serum PFAS will be associated primarily with community-related exposure sources. Aim 2: Examine
associations between serum PFAS and dyslipidemia among U.S. volunteer firefighters. We hypothesize
that serum PFOA and PFOS (the most frequently detected and studied PFAS) will be positively associated with
total cholesterol and LDL. We will also assess associations between less commonly studied PFAS and seven
lipid measures. We will use single-pollutant and mixture models to characterize the effects of multiple
simultaneous PFAS exposures. This work will advance our understanding of the health impacts of this
environmental exposure in a critical population of community-based first responders."

Non-invasive methodologies to visualize individual cells and assess molecular dynamics are needed
to improve our understanding of visual function and cellular metabolism in the living eye. Some of the
key molecules involved in the visual cycle and cellular energy production are intrinsically fluorescent.
However, they are inaccessible in the living eye using single-photon excitation because the excitation
wavelength range is not transmitted by the optics of the eye. We have developed two-photon excited
fluorescence ophthalmoscopy (TPEFO) to excite these otherwise inaccessible fluorophores with near-
infrared light in conjunction with an adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope that enables non-
invasive high-resolution imaging of many different cell classes throughout the in vivo retina. With
TPEFO, visual cycle kinetics can be characterized through the intensity changes of emitted two-photon
excited fluorescence from photoreceptors. During this funding period, the unique capabilities of TPEFO
will be enhanced to measure additional meaningful fluorescence properties in pre-clinical models. As
a window into the molecular dynamics of the visual cycle, we will track, in conjunction with the kinetics
of emitted fluorescence in response to visual stimulation, changes in the fluorescence lifetime of
photoreceptors. Our second aim is to non-invasively measure neuronal function by tracking emitted
two-photon excited fluorescence kinetics and lifetime from the inner retina. Finally, we will compare the
TPEFO intensity emitted in different spectral bands to calculate the optical redox ratio, a measure of a
cell's balance between aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. All of these measures may be indicators of
cell health and function. In addition to characterizing the TPEFO properties in healthy eyes, we will use
systemic hypoxia as a model of altered cellular respiration to represent the potential changes that occur
early in disease. This research has the potential to provide insight into normal and altered biochemical
processes and improve our understanding of diseases that impact retinal metabolism and visual
function such as glaucoma, macular degeneration and Leber hereditary optic neuropathy."

The social reorientation of the adolescent period is accompanied by extensive neurodevelopmental changes.
To understand the neurodevelopmental networks underlying responses to social environments and how social
connectedness influences neurodevelopment, manipulation of social connectedness among youth is required,
which is impossible in a large-scale setting. In 2020, the COVID pandemic happened, in the midst of
longitudinal follow-up of participants in the Adolescent Brain Cognition Development (ABCD) study, inducing
dramatic changes to social connectedness in adolescents in the study. Because the levels of stay-at-home
restriction were imposed agnostically to participants' pre-pandemic status, this becomes a naturally occurred
experiment on social connectedness among adolescents. Together with the comprehensive pre-pandemic
assessments, longitudinal follow-up with surveys and geolocation data collected during the pandemic period,
and the resumption of multimodal imaging scans and regular assessments restarting during, and continuing
after 2021, we can use longitudinal ABCD data to critically examine the relationships between social
connectedness and neurodevelopment among youth. In particular, we propose to use ABCD data to
investigate 1) the neurobiological and social factors (pre-pandemic) that render an individual more sensitive to
the disruption of social connectedness (peri-pandemic), contributing to emotional turmoil during and beyond
the pandemic period; 2) the modulating factors that buffer/exacerbate the emotion responses during a
prolonged period of social disruption (peri-pandemic); and 3) the extent of deviation in neurodevelopment after
the pandemic (post-pandemic) in relation to the varying levels of social disruptions in ABCD participants during
the pandemic. We will pursue these aims by utilizing a novel combination of methods from high-dimensional
data analysis and population inference, innovatively tailoring the analytic strategies to avoid potential biases
and spurious associations. The proposed research is of high public health interest because the identified
neurobiological mechanisms underlying the emotional responses toward the disruption of social
connectedness will provide novel insights for therapeutics and public health interventions in adolescents, due
to the population-informed ABCD sample. By sharing our developed tools and derived social variables for this
research program, we will impact the field immediately. These novel analytic tools enable us and others to
more deeply investigate with ABCD data, neurodevelopmental processes specifically related to social
connectedness. Results can inform peri- and post-pandemic clinical practice to regain and improve mental
health in youth."

Cellular senescence has been characterized as a state of irreversible cell-cycle arrest coupled with a secretory
program that can profoundly impact the tissue microenvironment. Our current understanding of senescence is
largely based on cell culture and model-based studies. Research on the relevant signaling pathways and
mechanisms underlying cellular senescence across human tissues over time is lacking. Our ability to leverage
recent advances in omics and molecular imaging technologies enables us to investigate the transcriptional
changes and secretory features driving and/or associated with senescence at higher depths and resolution
than ever before. Here, we propose to develop the Washington University Senescence Tissue Mapping Center
(WU-SN-TMC) within the NIH Senescence Network (SenNet). Our WU-SN-TMC will develop cellular
senescence atlases using 500 human samples from four essential tissue types: bone marrow, breast,
colon, and liver. We will first optimize our omics and imaging technologies and platforms for capturing,
detecting, characterizing, and visualizing senescent cells; develop computational tools and models for accurate
identification of senescent cells and markers; construct breast, bone marrow, colon, and liver senescence
atlases in spatial and temporal contexts; and assess the landscape and heterogeneity of senescence. With
these initial atlases, we will further characterize, validate, and define cellular senescence phenotypes and
biomarkers using perturbation methods and investigate the interactions between senescent cells and the
senescence-associated microenvironment. Finally, we will work with other SenNet centers to build
comprehensive, major organ/tissue senescence atlases by integrated and comparative studies of all SenNet
data across tissue types, time, sex, age, and ancestry groups. As a member of the SenNet program, WU-SN-
TMC will employ state-of-the-art omics and imaging technologies, including bulk proteogenomics, single cell
sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, CODEX molecular imaging, 3D light sheet microscopy plus expansion
technologies that are likely to mature over the funding period, such as single molecule sequencing, to generate
high-resolution, multi-parameter biomarkers and maps of cellular senescence in the four tissue types selected.
We have the established infrastructure and expertise to successfully conduct this work, including high quality
biospecimen collection, omics and imaging data production, experimental confirmation and validation, and high
throughput, standardized, and reproducible data analysis. In conclusion, we will work closely with other SenNet
centers and the Consortium Organization and Data Coordination Center (CODCC), to generate comprehensive
atlases across major human tissue types under various physiological conditions, including changes across the
human lifespan."

 An estimated 250 million children under five years of age in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)
are at risk of failing to reach their potential in cognitive and social-emotional development because of poverty-
related risk factors. The long-term goal of this proposal is to inform evidence-based programs and policies to
support children in low-income communities to grow and develop to their full potential. While many studies of
risk and resilience in developmental science have focused on singular or a small number of risk and protective
factors and time points, development is a dynamic system, and children often contend with constellations of
risks that can change over time and interact with each other, rather than isolated instances of adverse
circumstances. Challenges for studying these questions about the timing and interactions of risk and protective
factors predicting developmental outcomes are the large sample size required and the high cost and human
resource investment necessary to collect longitudinal data. This proposal is to conduct secondary analysis of
existing data collected during pregnancy, infancy, and childhood from the sample enrolled in the International
Lipid-Based Nutrient Supplements Project in Ghana 2009-2012 at â¤ 20 weeks of gestation (n=1320). The
dataset contains more than 30 indicators of biological risks (such as low birth weight, premature delivery,
growth stunting, and anemia) and psychosocial risks (such as maternal depression and lack of learning
opportunities in the home environment), and multilevel protective factors (including child, home and school)
during pregnancy, at birth, in infancy (18 months; n=1173), and at kindergarten age (4-6 years; n=966). An
additional follow-up assessment is currently being conducted in 2020-2021 at age 8-10 years. This rich,
longitudinal dataset will be leveraged to investigate a new sequential multiple hit model of risk and resilience,
which expands on multi-hit models used in clinical research to explain the etiology of diseases such as cancer
and Alzheimerâs disease. According to a multi-hit model, an early hit-free experience protects children from
adverse outcomes associated with later hits, while conversely an early hit causes children to be more
susceptible to later hits. Applying this model to risk and resilience, we conceptualize a hit as high exposure to
biological or psychosocial risks at a given time point. This leads to the hypothesis that early low risk experience
will protect children from adverse outcomes associated with later risk exposures. That is, among children with
early exposure to a greater magnitude of risks, versus those with low early risk exposure, stronger associations
will be found between later risk exposure and outcomes. Further understanding of the dynamics of the timing
and interaction of such exposures is an essential first step to design interventions targeting risk prevention, as
well as promotion of protective factors, at the time points when they will most likely show positive impacts on
child outcomes."

Liver cancer is one of the most rapidly increasing cancers over the past decades in the United States. The
causes for this long-term increase are unclear, but could stem from exposures to possibly carcinogenic
environmental contaminants. One likely source is per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a group of
synthetic chemicals that are highly persistent and accumulate in human liver tissue. Emerging, converging
evidence from laboratory animals and occupational mortality studies strongly support the role of PFAS in liver
carcinogenesis. However, these studies are limited by small sample sizes, restriction to occupational
exposure, and studying single types of PFAS. Hence, we propose the first comprehensive prospective pooled
cohort study in non-occupational settings to examine real-world human exposure to PFAS (of multiple types
and mixtures) in relation to liver cancer incidence. Our long-term goal is to identify novel risk factors for liver
cancer to reduce liver cancer burden. Moreover, liver cancer incidence is higher in African Americans and
Hispanics compared with whites, but the causes of these disparities remain unclear. Furthermore, more liver
cancer cases in the United States are not caused by chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and C virus (HCV)
infections, but risk factors for non-viral liver cancer remain poorly understood. The objective of this proposal is
to comprehensively assess the relationship between mixture exposure to PFAS and liver cancer risk overall,
by racial/ethnic groups, and by HBV/HCV status. To do so, we propose this first comprehensive study to
date of exposures to PFAS and liver cancer risk through a pooling project that leverages extensive resources
from six well-characterized cohort studies. This pooling project includes a racially/ethnically diverse population
followed for up to 32 years, along with pre-diagnosis plasma samples and validated covariate data. Our
specific aims are to characterize the associations between plasma levels of PFAS and risk of developing liver
cancer in this pooled nested case-control study with measured HBV/HCV status data (Aim 1); and assess the
extent to which certain PFAS mixture patterns act synergistically to increase liver cancer risk (Aim 2). In
exploratory aims, we will quantify the aforementioned associations by major liver cancer subtypes, and further
estimate the associations between plasma PFAS levels and survival among patients with liver cancer. This
proposal is innovative in addressing an important, yet understudied research area of PFAS and liver cancer
through integrating cutting-edge technologies of PFAS assays and advanced methods of mixture analyses into
longitudinal cohort studies. The contribution is significant because this research will generate new insights into
the etiology of liver cancer, enable design of new prevention/intervention strategies and actions that reduce
liver cancer morbidity and mortality and related disparities. These findings will also provide new information on
health effects of PFAS for practitioners and regulatory agencies to make solid decisions, regulations, and
action plans to improve public health."

ARID1A, encoding a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, is the most frequently mutated
epigenetic regulator across human cancers. Most notably, inactivating mutations in ARID1A occur in ~50% of
ovarian clear cell carcinomas (OCCC) and ~30% of ovarian endometrioid carcinomas (OEC). There is an
unmet need for effective treatment modalities for ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancers. For example, OCCC is
generally refractory to standard agents used to treat epithelial ovarian cancer, and when diagnosed in
advanced stages, OCCC carries the worst prognosis of all ovarian cancer subtypes. The overall goal of this
proposal is to develop a novel therapeutic strategy for ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancers by combining a
clinically applicable metabolic glutaminase inhibitor with an immune checkpoint blockade. We show that the
ARID1A inactivation creates a dependence on the glutamine metabolism. We also show that ARID1A
inactivation sensitizes ovarian cancer to anti-PD-L1 treatment. The objectives of this application are to
investigate the mechanisms underlying the dependence on the glutamine metabolism created by ARID1A
inactivation and to investigate a combination therapeutic strategy for ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancer. Our
central hypothesis is that ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancer can be therapeutically eradicated by the
combination of a clinically applicable glutaminase inhibitor such as CB-839 and an anti-PD-L1 immune
checkpoint blockade. Two Specific Aims are proposed: Aim 1 is to investigate the mechanism underlying the
dependence of ARID1A mutation on the glutamine metabolism; and Aim 2 will develop a novel therapeutic
approach for ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancer by combining a clinically applicable glutaminase inhibitor and
anti-PD-L1. The proposed studies are highly innovative because they challenge current research/clinical
paradigms and utilize innovative methods to explore new intervention strategies for ARID1A-mutated ovarian
cancers. The research proposed is of high impact because it will provide a scientific rationale for developing
urgently needed novel therapeutic strategies by repurposing the clinically applicable glutaminase inhibitor CB-
839 and an FDA-approved immune checkpoint blockade for ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancer, a disease that
currently has no effective therapy. Since ARID1A is the most frequently mutated epigenetic regulator across
human cancers, the mechanistic insights gained from the current studies will have broad implications for many
different types of cancers as well."

Antiretroviral treatment (ART) options for pregnant women and children living with HIV have fallen behind those
for adults, reflecting the substantial research gap for modern ART regimens in these groups. Safety and efficacy
studies of specific ART regimens in pregnancy, and strategies for starting modern ART in early infancy, have
become research priorities. Here we propose a series of interrelated projects that expand the scientific objectives
and data utilization of a valuable NIH-funded nationwide birth surveillance system in Botswana (the Tsepamo
Study), and connect it with the infrastructure provided by an existing program for identifying and treating infants
with HIV (the Early Infant Treatment Study, or EIT). The four proposed projects, anchored by administrative and
data cores, include:
1) Tsepamo Plus: Expanded Congenital Abnormalities Surveillance and an Emulated Clinical Trial to
Evaluate Weight Impact on Birth Outcomes for Newer ART Regimens: an expanded surveillance program
for neural tube defects and other congenital abnormalities following exposure to modern ART regimens, and an
emulated clinical trial to address critical questions related to use of ART regimens by maternal weight strata.
2) Methodology: Developing Reporting Criteria for Pregnancy Surveillance Cohorts and New Techniques
for Supporting Target Trials: the creation of surveillance reporting criteria in pregnancy cohorts and validation
of a target trial approach to ART regimen comparisons.
3) Point-of-Care HIV Testing and Early Dolutegravir Use for Infants: a new approach to targeted facility-
based point-of-care HIV testing, combined with an optimized ART management strategy that uses dolutegravir
from early infancy.
4) Pioneering Precision Medicine Approaches for Immune Control of Pediatric HIV-1 Infection: utilizing
shared data and infrastructure to efficiently obtain specimens, this project will bank HIV sequences from early-
treated infants, measure and compare viral reservoir and chromosomal positioning between ART regimens, and
study immune responses to mRNA vaccines among children with HIV to begin development of an mRNA HIV
vaccine program for children in Botswana.
This P01 brings together a group of experienced investigators who will forge a cohesive research program using
the unique data sources and outstanding physical infrastructure available from the Tsepamo and EIT research
programs in Botswana. Each project addresses key scientific issues related to ART use during pregnancy and
initiation of ART in early infancy, and together they will efficiently close research gaps for women and children
with HIV."
10810634,"Novel and effective anticancer therapies are still of great need since they hold the potential for lower mortality
rates, reoccurrence and better quality of life for patients. Cancer is a genetic disease, but its development also
involves multiple epigenetic alterations. Epigenetics regulates transcription by modulating chromatin
architecture through different mechanisms. Hence, dysregulation of such mechanisms can result in aberrant
gene expression or silencing, which in turn can lead to carcinogenesis. One of the most relevant epigenetic
modifications is the methylation of lysine 27 at histone 3 (H3K27), a broadly known repressive histone mark.
H3K27 methylation is incorporated by the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), a multimeric protein
complex formed by four core components: EZH2, EED, SUZ12 and RbAp46/48, all of which are essential for
its catalytic activity. Overexpression of PRC2 proteins, particularly of EZH2, results in hyperactivation of the
complex and high levels of H3K27m3, which are associated to a myriad of human cancers. Several PRC2
inhibitors have been discovered to date, some which are currently in clinical development.
These compounds
target either the catalytic SET domain of EZH2 or EED allosterically. Although they have delivered some
promising results, recent reports indicate that extended dosing with them leads to secondary EZH2 mutants
that become resistant to treatment. Hence, novel inhibitors of PRC2 function are of great interest, since such
compounds could offer
an alternative solution to address the above-mentioned resistant profiles. Recently, our
laboratory has reported the discovery of a potent, cell permeable stapled peptide,
GN-ZW11, as a potent and
selective inhibitor of H3K27me3 in renal carcinoma cells. This compound was designed to target the SANT2
domain in EZH2, and thus it may well be the first-in class EZH2 allosteric inhibitor described to date. The
current proposal aims to expand our preliminary studies with GN-ZW11 by carrying out, first, structural-activity
relationship studies to understand the molecular determinants of its binding, as well as to gather valuable data
for the design of GN-ZW11 analogs with improved potency and stability. Secondly, we propose to carry out
further biological assays in metastatic renal carcinoma cells to better understand the mechanism of action of
GN-ZW11 and to evaluate its therapeutic potential for the treatment of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Finally,
we plan on expanding our preliminary studies to other cancer cell lines in which PRC2 proteins have been
found overexpressed and to investigate the impact of PRC2 inhibition by GN-ZW11 in vivo, by measuring its
ability to induce tumor regression in mouse xenografts models. In summary, the proposed research project will
result in the preparation and validation of a new family of allosteric inhibitors of PRC2 function. We expect that
the knowledge gained from these studies will help to improve our overall understanding surrounding the role of
EZH2 in oncology, and will also guide the identification of targeted chemotherapeutics for treating humans in
the future."

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men in the United States. The first line of treatment for
men with aggressive prostate cancer is hormone therapy or androgen ablation therapy. Although initial
responses are observed, unfortunately, the disease commonly recurs in its aggressive hormone therapy-
resistant form also known as castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Current therapies for hormone
therapy resistant prostate cancer or CRPC prolong the patientsâ lifespan by only a few months. Thus, there is
an urgent need to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of CRPC in order to define
new strategies to overcome aggressive prostate cancer.
Trop2 is a cell surface protein that is found altered in multiple types of human cancers. Our recent studies
demonstrate that Trop2 is a novel promising therapeutic target for aggressive prostate cancer due to its high
expression in advanced prostate cancer and its oncogenic role in the disease. The goals of the proposed
research are to:
1) Establish Trop2 activation as a driver of CRPC and assess its role in tumor maintenance.
2) Investigate the molecular mechanisms through which Trop2 contributes to the development of the aggressive
disease.
The completion of the proposed project will lead to defining new molecular mechanisms underlying the
development of aggressive prostate cancer. The proposed project will evaluate the oncogenic role of Trop2
receptor and its activation in aggressive prostate cancer in pre-clinical models of prostate cancer creating an
important translational link between the proposed research and treatment of patients with aggressive disease in
the near future. Due to the high expression of Trop2 in many epithelial cancers, we believe that our findings will
be applicable to a broad range of cancers."
10814737,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Despite significant time and money spent on post-stroke rehabilitation, stroke survivors are left with reduced
walking capacity and significant disability. Rehabilitation following stroke is required to make gains in walking
beyond those achieved through spontaneous recovery during the first several months after stroke and this
occurs through relearning movements that have been disrupted due to damage to the brain. Enhancing post-
stroke motor learning is therefore critical to improving post-stroke rehabilitation. Most research examining the
effects of stroke on locomotor learning has focused on a specific form of implicit locomotor learning
(sensorimotor adaptation), which is relatively automatic. Post-stroke rehabilitation, however, is dominated by
techniques, such as visual feedback and verbal cues, that are meant to encourage patientsâ use of explicit
learning (requiring attention, awareness). Considering that the effects of stroke on these two categories of
learning (explicit and implicit) are likely quite different, since different brain areas are primarily involved in each
type of learning, we must understand the effects of stroke on both types of learning. Moreover, factors such as
cognitive deficits likely have differing effects, depending on the type of learning. Cognitive function is thought to
be critical for more explicit forms of motor learning (specifically strategy-based learning), unlike implicit learning
which is thought to place less demand on cognitive resources. Despite the numerous cognitive deficits present
after stroke, the influence of cognitive function on motor learning (both implicit and explicit) after stroke has
largely been ignored. Finally, differences in explicit and implicit learning may also influence the effects of
exercise priming, (the coupling of a short bout of high intensity exercise with a learning task), that has been
suggested as a mechanism to enhance motor learning in rehabilitation. In Aims 1 and 2 of this project, using
both behavioral and computational data, we will determine the relationship between cognitive deficits (and
other factors, such as stroke location) and locomotor learning in both explicit (strategy-based) and implicit
(sensorimotor adaptation) locomotor learning tasks in those with chronic (>6 months) stroke. In Aim 3 we
examine the effect of a short bout of high intensity exercise immediately following strategy-based locomotor
learning on the retention of the newly learned walking pattern, along with its interaction with cognitive deficits,
in those with chronic stroke. The results of this proposal have immediate implications for clinical practice
because they will inform clinicians when to use certain techniques (e.g.-visual feedback with explicit cues,
exercise priming) in patients with stroke with particular cognitive deficits, allowing for the design of
personalized rehabilitation interventions."
10782983,"This project proposes an integrated suite of microscopy and data analysis advances that would enable
quantitative, mechanistic analysis of immune-microenvironment dynamics in poor prognosis solid tumors.
While immunotherapies are showing remarkable clinical responses in some advanced cancers, to date, their
impact on many solid tumors has been modest. This is due, in part, to solid tumor microenvironments limiting
the effectiveness of natural immune responses and immunotherapies. Yet, our understanding of the physical
and molecular mechanisms governing T cell infiltration, distribution, and function in native tumor
microenvironments remains extremely limited. As such, defining key T cell behaviors as a function of complex
tumor microenvironments will identify design criteria that can be used to develop novel cell engineering
strategies that optimize T cell-centric therapies for solid tumors. To this end the research theme of the U54
Center for Multiparametric Imaging of Tumor Immune Microenvironments (C-MITIE) is to define physical and
molecular barriers to effective anti-tumor immunity and immunotherapies through advancement and
development of state-of-the-art live cell and tissue optical imaging platforms and quantitative analyses. To
achieve our goals, our framework brings together advanced optical imaging platforms, nano- and micro-
fabrication, genome engineering, cancer immunology, and biophysical modeling. Thus, from this integrated
effort we seek to define mechanisms of immune suppression that guide the development of next-generation
cell-based immunotherapies."
10745639,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Glioblastoma (GBM) is a lethal brain cancer treated by surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. While
fractionated radiation therapy (60Gy delivered over 4-6 weeks) is efficacious in killing many cancer cells, a subset
gains radioresistance and survive, leading to tumor recurrence. Understanding the mechanisms underlying
adaptive radioresistance may lead to new therapeutic approaches to overcome radioresistance. To decipher
radioresistance mechanisms, we need sophisticated models that reflect the genetic heterogeneity of GBM,
including the stem cell population, which is considered to be particularly prone to acquiring radioresistance. Till
now, only limited radioresistance models have been developed and the role of glioma stem cells (GSCs) has not
been properly examined. To address this gap in knowledge, I developed novel preclinical models of mouse and
human GSCs that were progressively adapted to repeated irradiation. Using these models, I identified a novel
resistance mechanism driven by IGF1-induced N-cadherin signaling validating my approach. To identify
additional radioresistance genes, I performed a genome-wide CRISPR library screening in radioresistant human
GSCs and found new candidate genes, including Syndecan 1 (SDC1). I showed that SDC1 expression is
increased in 4 different radioresistant GSC lines and correlates with malignancy and poor outcome of patients
with malignant glioma (TCGA database). Knockout of SDC1 in radioresistant GSCs restored radio-sensitivity,
decreased IGF1R expression and suppressed IGF1R signaling. As prior literature has shown that SDC1 and
IGF1R interact, these findings suggest that SDC1 and IGF1R might be components of the same radioresistance
pathway. Based on this rationale, I hypothesize that increased SDC1 expression induces adaptive GBM
radioresistance by activating IGF1R signaling; and that blocking SDC1-induced IGF1R activation will antagonize
radioresistance and increase survival. I will test my hypothesis through the following aims: 1) examine how SDC1
confers GSC radioresistance, 2) determine how SDC1 activates IGF1R signaling, and 3) evaluate the efficacy
of targeting SDC1-induced radioresistance in mouse models. My project is innovative because the role of SDC1-
IGF1R-mediated signaling in GSC radioresistance has never been examined. This project will lead to the
development of future my research and will become a foundation for my future career. My career plan is to
systematically identify the drivers and related signaling mechanisms underlying radioresistance in GSCs. I have
a dual background as a neurosurgeon and basic neuro-oncology researcher and have further secured the
support of advisors and professional collaborators (see letters of support). Successful completion of this project
will lead to the development of better therapies for the treatment of therapy-resistant GBM and propel my
transition to an independent investigator in neuro-oncology."
10795939,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The University of Rochester, Wilmot Cancer Institute is a health and research institute ideally suited to achieve
the goals of the NCI NCTN as a Lead Academic Site. Our longstanding activity as U10-funded members of
ECOG (1968-2002) and SWOG (2002-2012) as well as our dedication to NCTN trials over the past 5 years
indicate our continued investment in and commitment to clinical and translational laboratory research in cancer,
particularly the development of and accrual to late-phase Cancer Clinical Trials. In an era where both the biology
of cancer and development of novel therapeutic strategies have become more complex, requiring
multidisciplinary teams of investigators and extensive tissue banking and correlative studies, our translational
scientific program and dedication to the NCTN program is critical for ultimate success.
Our Clinical Trials Program consists of a leadership group and faculty across the departments of medicine
(hematology and medical oncology), surgery, urology, radiation oncology and obstetrics and gynecology who
are highly invested in the NCTN program. The NCTN trials structure is a key component of our Clinical Trials
Office, and utilizes multidisciplinary disease Working Groups as the hub for protocol management, ensuring
appropriate and broad-based expertise. Our leadership roles within the NCTN groups, committee membership,
publication record, and scientific achievements position us well for continued quality contributions to the ultimate
mission of NCTN. We have a long history of coordinating cooperative group studies and continue to do so,
building on preliminary work conducted at University of Rochester but also collaborating across all of the US
based NCTN groups.
Between 2014 and 2017, we were able to activate NCTN clincal trials quickly, accrued more than 100 patients
annually on average, and submitted high quality data in an efficient manner. As such, Rochester was recogized
as a High Performing Site by the NCI. We plan to further increase this effort across the Network given our
expanded regional presence, while continuing to focus on underrepresented patient groups including the
adolesent/young adult and geriatric populations. We have led the country in accrual to several important studies,
including studies conducted on rare diseases, and our efforts to enhance minority accrual have resulted in
accrual to clinical trials representative of our overall population. The University of Rochester is dedicated to the
mission of the NCTN and will continue to contibute to the development and conduct of associated trials at the
highest level."
10845460,"Background. Metastasis to vital organs is the cause of death in a large majority of cancer patients. Although it
is of eminent clinical importance to understand how systemic disease evolves, metastasis remains one of the
least understood aspects of cancer progression. We still do not have the answers to many fundamental
questions: Are metastasis founders a random selection of cells from primary tumors in which all cells have
essentially equal metastatic ability? Or do specialized metastatic clones evolve, perhaps in intermediate
sanctuary spaces like regional lymph nodes, and then proceed to colonize distant body parts? Are metastases
formed late in tumor progression, by highly evolved and aggressive clones that are the winners of many years
of selection within the primary tumor? Or can metastases already be formed early in tumor development, by
less evolved tumor cells? If both scenarios exist, would such âearlyâ metastases behave differently from âlateâ
disseminating tumor cells? Method. We have developed a methodology to reconstruct a cancer's evolutionary
history with great accuracy. Our method relies on the analysis of insertion/deletion mutations in hypermutable,
non-coding polyguanine repeats. The lineage information encoded in these sequences is unusually rich:
genotyping of only a few dozen repeats can outperform exome sequencing for phylogenetic reconstruction.
Using polyguanine fingerprinting, we have recently shown that regional lymph node metastases are not the
source of liver metastases in most colorectal cancers, in contrast to a widely held paradigm. Aims and Impact.
Here, we propose to build upon these results and further elucidate critical events in the evolution of metastatic
colorectal cancer. We will determine if lethal distant metastases in the lungs evolve from specialized metastatic
clones that reside in the colonic lymph nodes. We have previously established that 65% of liver metastases are
seeded directly from the primary tumor, but the anatomy of the gastrointestinal vasculature suggests that this
percentage could be significantly lower for other distant metastases. If this hypothesis were confirmed, our
understanding of the role of the lymphatics in colorectal cancer would be fundamentally altered. Second, we
present preliminary data indicating that distant metastases whose evolutionary trajectory diverged from the
primary tumor in early progression stages are considerably less aggressive than metastases that emerge in
later stages. We propose to study and confirm this phenomenon in a large patient cohort. The successful
outcome will be a simple, cost-effective test to predict long-term survival in a subset of patients with metastatic
cancer. Since some patients can survive for years or even decades in spite of metastatic disease, while others
die within weeks of diagnosis, such risk stratification would be of substantial benefit to both patients and their
care providers."
10860921,"Project Summary
 Impairments in new learning and memory are common in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and negatively impact
several aspects of everyday life, including occupational and social functioning. Despite the demand for learning
and memory treatments few cognitive rehabilitation (CR) protocols to date are supported by Class I research
evidence, thereby limiting the degree to which potentially efficacious treatments may be applied to MS. To
address this critical need, the presently proposed randomized clinical trial (RCT) examines the efficacy of an 8-session CR protocol encompassing training in the application of three strategies (self-generation, spaced
learning and self-testing) with the greatest empirical evidence to treat impaired learning and memory in persons
with MS, Strategy-based Training to Enhance Memory (STEM). The currently proposed double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT) addresses a central objective highlighted in the NCMRR 2016
Research Plan by seeking to reduce âsymptoms and secondary conditions associated with disability
through the development, adaptation or evaluation on interventionsâ (p. 1531).
 We will conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT, administering STEM to 120 participants with MS
who evidence NLM deficits. Outcome will be assessed via 3 mechanisms, an Assessment of Global Functioning
(AGF), which examines everyday functioning and quality of life, a Neuropsychological Evaluation (NPE) to
examine objective cognitive performance, and neuroimaging to elucidate neural mechanisms of STEM and its
mechanisms. The examination of daily life activities as an a priori endpoint in this RCT is a highly innovative
aspect of the currently proposed work, highlighted as a significant gap in the rehabilitation literature by the
NCMRR1. We will additionally evaluate the longer-term efficacy of STEM on everyday functioning and NPE
through a 6-month follow-up evaluation and evaluate the impact of booster sessions in maintaining the treatment
effect over time. Importantly, the rigorous research design employed in the current study is highly responsive to
the objectives set forth by the NCMRR in their most recent research plan, to âincrease the quality of evidence
for rehabilitation interventions â¦through increased focus on the designâ¦and outcomes of these
interventionsâ (p. 152). Such âevidence based approaches are essential for rehabilitation researchâ
(NCMRR, 20162)
 Supported by strong preliminary data, this novel and innovative intervention has the potential to significantly
remediate NLM deficits in persons with MS, ultimately leading to improved social and occupational functioning
(i.e., participation) and overall QOL. Results of the current study will provide Class I evidence for the STEM
treatment protocol for persons with MS due to the methodologically rigorous study design. Finally, the currently
proposed work is well grounded in a long line of memory rehabilitation work at KF led by the current PI and
represents the next systematic step in the line of work examining strategy training.

10847315,"Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) remains one of the solid tumors that is associated with the poorest prognosis. Standard therapy includes maximal safe resection, external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), and cytotoxic chemotherapy. Despite this, there are high rates of disease recurrence. Local/regional recurrence is particularly difficult for patients with ATC, resulting in airway and/or esophageal compromise which contributes to mortality and metastatic dissemination. Novel therapies are thus needed to improve disease control and lengthen survival. Recently, genomic profiling of ATC has uncovered high frequency mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway (particularly BRAF and RAS), as well as other DNA damage and cell cycle checkpoint control genes, including TP53. Our preclinical data supports that an activating BRAFV600E mutation promotes resistance to EBRT and genotoxic therapies, through the non-homologous end-joining repair (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway. In addition, targeted inhibition of BRAFV600E with a small molecule inhibitor results in sensitization to EBRT in BRAF mutant (BRAFm) ATC. Furthermore, treatment of BRAF mutant cells with a MEK-1/2 inhibitor also results in radiosensitization. Since BRAF wild-type (BRAFwt) ATC accounts for ~ 60-70% of cases, developing targeted strategies for radiosensitization in BRAFwt ATC is also critical. As such, we find that TP53 mutant ATC is effectively radiosensitized by ATR and Wee1 kinase inhibitors, highlighting the dependency of these tumors on the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint. Finally, we will explore radiation sensitization
approaches for RAS mutant ATC, another common BRAFwt molecular subtype of ATC. In this proposal, we will attempt multiple strategies to advance therapy for patients with BRAFm and BRAFwt ATC. In Aim 1, we will perform a phase I trial to determine the maximally-tolerated doses of dabrafenib (BRAF inhibitor) and trametinib (MEK-1/2 inhibitor) to be used concurrently with EBRT for BRAFm ATC, and identify biomarkers of response and molecular pathways leading to resistance. In Aim 2, we will perform mechanistic studies to better understand how BRAFm leads to accelerated DNA repair, test novel therapeutic strategies targeting components of DNA repair, and develop and optimize novel strategies targeting DNA repair in combination with EBRT and other genotoxic therapies for BRAFm ATC. In Aim 3, we will attempt to develop novel strategies for treating BRAF wild-type ATC, by testing different targeted strategies for TP53 and RAS deficient or mutated ATC in vitro and in vivo to support future clinical testing of these combinations. Together, these studies will improve our understanding of how BRAF mutations impart radio-resistance, and identify new tumor-selective combinatorial approaches for treating patients with BRAF mutant and BRAF wild-type ATC."
10847314,"Abstract
In 2020, over 21,000 women were diagnosed with ovarian cancer (OC). While there have been significant
therapeutic advances, effective screening for OC remains elusive. Women are more likely to present with an
advanced disease stage, contributing to the dismal five-year survival rate of 48%. Mortality is
disproportionately higher among Black women. Evidence has shown a multi-dimensional contribution to this
disparity and, while there has been extensive investigation into socioeconomic and environmental
determinants, biological contribution to the survival disparity is understudied. Because cancer disparities are
multifactorial, it is imperative to study the mechanisms through which social determinants impact biological risk
factors that influence advanced-stage OC. Experiences of discrimination (EOD) are more prevalent among
Black women and have been associated with chronic inflammation, a risk factor for advanced-stage OC. The
more aggressive subtypes of OC, including high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), arise from high in the
reproductive tract. Inflammation that occurs in this region may be the direct result of changes in the vaginal
microbiome that increase pH and promote ascending infection. Therefore, a potential pathway by which EOD
may influence development of advanced-stage OC is through dysregulation of the vaginal microbiome, a
phenomenon known as vaginal dysbiosis. The central thesis of this study is that psychosocial stress secondary
to EOD contributes to advanced-stage OC via vaginal dysbiosis. The proposed study will collect vaginal
microbial samples from Black and White women with OC and characterize the microbial community using 16S
rRNA sequencing. Subsequently, we propose to conduct an in-depth association study evaluating the
relationships between EOD, vaginal dysbiosis, OC stage, and survival. The associated R01-funded ORCHiD
study will provide extensive information on measures of acute stress, socioeconomic and environmental
factors as well as OC stage at diagnosis, course of treatment, and survival follow-up. Findings from this study
will direct future analysis of the compounded social and biological effect of psychosocial stress on OC etiology
and survival. The results of this study are essential to understanding the interaction of social and biological
mechanisms in OC disparity. Findings will inform future studies testing clinical interventions, for example, the
use of anti-inflammatory medications, as a potential strategy to mitigate disparities in advanced-stage OC."
10598510,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Young children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) remain highly vulnerable to episodes of hypoglycemia despite the
introduction of new insulin analogs, insulin pumps, and continuous glucose monitors (CGM). Parents and young
children living with T1D quickly learn to fear hypoglycemia because it is uncomfortable, embarrassing, seemingly
unpredictable, and potentially dangerous. Indeed, research shows that parents of young children report high
rates of moderate to severe hypoglycemia fear (FH). Unfortunately, FH leads to two problems: impaired quality
of life and compensatory behaviors that raise childrenâs blood glucose levels leading to on-going poor metabolic
control (HbA1c) and an increased risk for long-term vascular complications. Responding to a critical need for
interventions to treat parental FH in families of young children, we developed an innovative video-based
telemedicine intervention, called REDCHiP (Reducing Emotional Distress for Childhood Hypoglycemia in
Parents). REDCHiP uses cognitive behavioral therapy, T1D education, and behavioral parent training in a 10-
session individual and group-based telemedicine program, to reduce parental FH and to teach parents how to
change hypoglycemic avoidance behaviors. In our pilot work, we found preliminary efficacy for REDCHiP in
reducing parental FH, parenting stress, and childrenâs HbA1c. The objective of this R01 is to conduct a
randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing REDCHiP to a relevant attention control intervention (ATTN) in families
of young children, thereby continuing to establish its efficacy. The proposed R01 aims are: 1) To evaluate
whether parents who receive REDCHiP report reductions in FH and parenting stress at post-treatment compared
to parents who receive the ATTN; 2) To evaluate whether children of parents who receive REDCHiP have a
lower HbA1c and less glycemic variability at post-treatment compared to children of parents who receive ATTN;
3) To examine for maintenance of improvements in FH, parenting stress, and childrenâs HbA1c in a 3-month
followup. We will recruit 180 families with the goal of retaining at least 144 through the 3-month followup. After
informed consent, we will randomize parents to either REDCHiP or ATTN and have them complete baseline
measures (e.g., parent surveys, child glucose sensing, child/parent accelerometry, and child HbA1c). Then,
parents in both groups will participate in 10 video-based telemedicine sessions matched for time and format
(group v individual). At post-treatment, parents and children will repeat the baseline assessment; at the 3-month
followup, parents will complete surveys and children will undergo glucose sensing and an HbA1c. The impact of
the proposed R01 is high because parental FH is common and relates to poor T1D self-care and child glycemic
control, which can lead to expensive and dangerous present and future complications. It is Innovative because
of its use of video- and group-based telemedicine which is responsive to NIDDK initiatives as well as potentially
scalable to even smaller T1D centers. Efficacy testing REDCHiP in a larger RCT is the logical next step in our
research program and likely to yield an effective and scalable treatment that can improve childrenâs health."

The recent emergence of the epitranscriptomics field has opened the possibility to understand and manipulate
a previously underappreciated regulatory layer involved in biological processes. In particular, our research
focuses on m6A as a candidate of interest given that it is the most prevalent RNA modification in the nervous
system that controls multiple aspects of RNA metabolism. We have previously shown the critical roles of m6A
regulation in axonal plasticity and synaptic activity. This proposal extends our research scope and focuses on
how the m6A epitranscriptome responds to environmental perturbation using innovative methods for the
identification of biomarkers and molecular pathways linked to adverse outcomes. We will use system-wide
approaches to address the following questions: (i) What is the mechanism to remodel the m6A epitranscriptome
upon toxicant exposure, (ii) How do the dynamics of m6A reshape the transcriptome? (iii) What are the
characteristics of mis-localized RNA that are associated with disease state and risk? We expect that our
proposed study will significantly advance our understanding of how epitranscriptomic regulatory processes
constitute key pathogenic mechanisms following environmental challenges. Data gained from our systematic
profiling and functional validation may offer new opportunities for developing diagnostics and/or biomarkers to
facilitate the development of more effective prevention and treatment strategies for these diseases."

The aging process often results in decreased bone health in the lumbar spine which can lead to increased risk
of vertebral injury. Osteoporosis most affects the density and distribution of trabecular (spongy) bone, but current
models overlook the heterogeneous qualities of this region. Finite element (FE) modeling offers a noninvasive
method to assess fracture risk using metrics of bone quality measured from quantitative computed tomography
scans (qCT). However, due to current limitations of CT scans, it can be difficult to accurately quantify bone
degradation clinically. The primary objectives of this proposed study are to develop a novel computed trabecular
matrix for lumbar vertebrae trabeculae that will be used to extract additional information from CT scans. The
computed trabecular matrix that results from this study could provide additional insight into the relationship
between image data and bone strength.
Bone morphology, bone volume fraction (BV/TV), and cortical thickness will be measured in qCT scans of
cadaveric lumbar spine. In addition, average daily compressive load at each vertebra will be calculated from
patient weight and height. These metrics will be input to Optistruct, which will then perform topology optimization
to optimally distribute the load throughout the trabecular region. These vertebral models will be compressed until
failure. To validate the biomechanical properties of the computed trabecular matrix, the same cadaveric
vertebrae will be removed and compressed to failure using a servohydraulic uniaxial loading system.
The novel computed trabecular matrix will then be used to model the effects of aging on bone quality degradation.
Bone quality metrics of the lumbar spine will be obtained from 30 adults between 50-79 years of age who
underwent baseline and follow-up CT scans 12-48 months apart. A computed trabecular matrix will be created
for each follow-up and baseline scan to analyze changes in bone strength, vertebral geometry, and cortical
thickness.
This research will employ an interdisciplinary approach by using radiology, biomechanics, and orthopaedics to
study age-related bone decrement. The project will yield a novel computed trabecular matrix to extract additional
clinically relevant data from image series, further adding value to CT scans in the fields of geriatrics and
orthopaedics."

This application describes broadly based biophysical characterization of two important aspects
of bacterial cell physiology. First, the dynamics of the entire E. coli proteome will be quantified
as a function of growth rate and nutrient limitation, including measurement of protein turnover.
The set of bacterial proteins are carefully controlled to optimize the fitness and growth of
bacteria under a wide variety of conditions. The amount of protein devoted to various
biosynthetic pathway varies in a defined way that can be simply modeled as an economic
allocation problem. Second, the process of ribosome assembly will be investigated using
electron microscopy, mass spectrometry, single molecule fluorescence, and light microscopy.
Electron microscopy of intermediates that accumulate under perturbed conditions reveals a
distribution of structures that can be ordered into a putative assembly pathway. Single molecule
fluorescence allows the monitoring of individual steps in the complex assembly process.
Finally, we will extend the in vitro studies toward studying the ultrastructure of the locus of
ribosome assembly in cells, using a combination of light microscopy and cryo-electron
tomography. The overall goal is to develop a complete mechanistic framework for assembly of
the largest cellular machine, that is responsible for all protein synthesis, and that requires
almost a third of the energy budget for a rapidly dividing cell."
10784587,"Project Summary/Abstract: Gulf War Illness (GWI) continues to plague a subsection of the veterans deployed
in the Persian Gulf war even 30 years after they returned home. The illness has taken a heavy toll on the overall
quality of life of our deployed veterans. We still do not have a definitive treatment regimen for Gulf War Illness
even though several drug candidates have shown promise. Recent research in the last five years have revealed
the role of host gut microbiome in gastrointestinal disturbance, systemic inflammation and neurotrophic
abnormalities in Gulf War Illness mouse models. A recent study from our laboratory and our collaborators at
Boston University showed that veterans with GWI exhibit microbial dysbiosis with decreased butyrogenic
bacterial profile. We have preliminary data that the host virome signature is altered in GWI veterans. In addition,
we showed that gut virome alteration in a mouse model of GWI is strongly associated with increased serum
levels of IL6, a proinflammatory cytokine known to cause systemic and neurocognitive disease. Results showed
that short chain fatty acids such as butyrate restored healthy microbiome, improved microbial metabolism in the
gut apart from attenuating GWI symptom persistence in preclinical studies. Butyrate, a nutraceutical that is
endogenously produced in the host gut following bacterial fermentation also has shown promise in
gastrointestinal disturbances such as IBS and IBD and is a good treatment choice among gastroenterologists.
Butyrate is also effective as a strong anti-inflammatory molecule in preclinical studies. The FDA has long
approved the use of butyrate as a safe food additive and use of it as enemas for GI disturbances. Interestingly,
Gulf War Illness patients show gastrointestinal disturbances (constipation, diarrhea, bloating, acid reflux, pain),
chronic fatigue and neurocognitive abnormalities. The GWI patients also have an altered microbiome that is
associated with systemic inflammation.
Objective of the trial: The goal of this clinical trial is to determine if a Butyrate formulation that consists of butyric
acid as calcium and magnesium derivatives in a single oral capsule administered twice a day is effective in
increasing physical functioning for Veterans with Gulf War Illness. The secondary outcome will focus on the
drug's role in (a) restoring gut microbiome and virome (that have been found altered in GWI veterans),
(b) decreasing gastrointestinal disturbances (constipation, diarrhea, pain) (c) decreasing chronic fatigue,
(d) decreasing systemic inflammation such a blood levels of proinflammatory cytokines and (d) a
decrease in cognitive deficits. The clinical trial involving butyrate on Gulf War Illness veterans will be
conducted in three sites across the nation. The sites of Columbia SC (primary-Columbia VA medical center),
Salt Lake City, Utah and Miami VA will work in tandem and in total concert to conduct this trial. This is a
randomized, two group, double blind, placebo controlled, Phase II clinical trial. The treatment group will
receive microencapsulated butyrate capsules (600 mg twice a day for 18 weeks). The placebo group will
receive matching placebo formulation twice a day for 18 weeks. The primary outcome measure for this clinical
trial is a change from baseline of VSF-36â¢ and CVLT II test scores, with respect to physical and mental
functioning and symptoms. The secondary outcome measures include changes from baseline of host-
microbiome signature, intestinal permeability assessment, peripheral pro-inflammatory biomarkers, and of
GWI-associated symptoms IBS, chronic pain, fatigue, sleep issues, and cognitive impairment.
Study Team: The 4 year clinical study will be carried out in three VAMCs and will be led by Dr.
Saurabh Chatterjee, Ph.D who has expertise on GWI , gut microbiome and butyrate pharmacology.
Columbia VAMC study will be co-led by Dr. Roy Mathew , M.D. and Dr. Rebeca Flores-Morales, M.D.

Rates of adolescent vaping are increasing rapidly. Current high school student use of electronic vaping
products (EVPs) rose from 1.5% in 2011 to 20.8% in 2018 â an increase from 220,000 to 3.05 million
adolescent users. Vaping is associated with respiratory symptoms, and exposure to nicotine can act as a
`gateway' to other drug use. Effective, school-based interventions are urgently needed to protect adolescents
from initiating or continuing use of EVPs. A recent US Surgeon General's report identified no school or
community based prevention program that reduces vaping behaviors among youth. This proposal takes
advantage of a state-supported prevention initiative to test the efficacy of Above the Influence of Vaping (ATI-
V). ATI-V trains peer nominated 8th-9th grade Peer Leader, and adult advisors. Peer Leaders learn skills and
implement school-wide prevention campaigns informed by communication science. Preliminary data show
that after training approximately 15% of 8th graders as Peer Leaders, who implemented school-wide campaigns,
students who were friends of Peer leader had reduced vaping intentions and vaping behaviors 2nd semester of
8th grade. New York State has provided funds to support schools to implement ATI-V but no funds for efficacy
research. With support from New York State and a strong team of investigators, our project has three aims:
Aim 1. Efficacy. The primary aim of this study is to determine ATI-V impact in preventing vaping use (past
30 days any vaping, nicotine vaping, and regular use). Using an RCT design, 20 schools will be assigned to (a)
immediate ATI-V, or (b) wait-list for ATI-V training after 24 months. Approximately 3,800 8th graders will be
enrolled and followed for assessments in fall 8th grade, spring 8th grade, spring 9th grade, and mid-year 10th
grade. We will test for which students ATI-V is most effective and in what school contexts (school climate).
Aim 2. Mechanism. The second aim of this study to test the hypothesized mechanisms of ATI-V impact. To
accomplish this aim we will conduct statistical analyses of a mediation model to determine (a) whether ATI-V
improves students' perceptions that vaping is unacceptable to their peers (anti-vaping norms), connections to
supportive adults to address EVP concerns, and social influence of non-vaping students; and (b) whether the
impact of ATI-V on reduced vaping behavior is mediated by these improvements.
Aim 3. Implementation (Exploratory). Our exploratory aim is to identify implementation barriers and
facilitators by gathering qualitative data (observations, semi-structured interviews) from staff and students
from a subset of high and low implementing schools. The purpose is to identify what implementation
strategies and supports are needed for future schools to be successful in implementing ATI-V, if warranted by
the study findings. If study hypotheses are supported, this study will provide, to our knowledge, the first
evidence of a school-based prevention intervention that reduces adolescent vaping behaviors."

Slip and fall accidents remain a major cause of injuries in the food service industry. Use of appropriate shoes
has emerged as a powerful countermeasure in preventing these events. Although many footwear products are
labeled as slip-resistant, coefficient of friction (COF) performance varies across shoes and degrades as shoes
become worn. The primary objective of this proposed study is to develop and validate end-user shoe
selection and inspection tools for the food service industry. The foundation of the tools will be new COF data
that is specific to this industry. Tool development will employ a participatory user-centered design approach to
ensure usability and usefulness of the tools. The central hypothesis is that developing and optimizing tools
based on shoe-floor friction research and iterative user feedback will lead to effective tools that will be adopted
by the industry and, ultimately, prevent slips and falls. Four aims will be completed.
Aim 1: Identify flooring, contaminants, and shoes that are relevant to food service workers' slip risk.
Relevant flooring, contaminants and shoes will be identified using semi-structured interviews, site visits, and a
prioritization survey. The materials identified in this aim will inform materials used in Aim 2.
Aim 2: Build a database of friction performance for commonly-worn shoes. Identify generalizable
friction testing conditions. COF testing will be performed in the laboratory and workplace on shoes
commonly chosen by food industry workers, against the floors and contaminants that are determined to be
hazardous. Hypothesis 2.1: Correlations in COF exist across floor-contaminant conditions tested in the lab.
Hypothesis 2.2: Correlations in COF exist between lab tests and tests performed in the workplace.
Aim 3: Use a participatory approach to develop informational and assessment tools for selecting
appropriate high friction shoes and determining when worn shoes should be replaced. An informational
tool for selecting shoes (website, app, or guide) and a physical tool for monitoring wear (handheld meter,
phone app, or shoe scanner) will be developed using well-established user-centered design (UCD) principles.
Aim 4: Quantify effectiveness of the informational and physical tools to improve slip prevention
programs. Thirty food service locations will be recruited into groups: 1) placebo intervention, 2) basic
intervention (developed tools), 3) enhanced intervention (basic intervention plus supplemental support). Shoe-
floor-contaminant COF will be collected from workers' shoes in their workplace. Hypothesis 4.1 (Validation):
Employee shoes of organizations receiving the tools will have higher COF than those receiving the placebo
intervention. Hypothesis 4.2 (Verification): The COF of shoes in food service environments will be predicted
by COF values embedded in the informational and measurements from the physical tools.
This research addresses NORA objectives for the Traumatic Injury Cross-sector and for the Services Sector."

The STK11/LKB1 tumor suppressor is mutated in ~15% of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
cases, making it the third most frequent genetic alteration. LKB1 is frequently co-mutated with Kras, and
LKB1-mutant tumor biology is becoming increasingly of interest to the cancer field as the uniqueness
of the underlying tumor biology coupled with the lack of targeted therapy options is gaining attention.
Recent work identified a potent tumor promoting function of the HDAC3 complex in Kras-driven NSCLC,
and revealed that HDAC3 cooperates with the lung cancer lineage transcription factor NKX2-1 to drive a
unique transcriptional program in lung cancer cells with LKB1 mutation. Interestingly, regardless of LKB1
mutational status, HDAC3 was also found to directly repress the Senescence-Associated Secretory
Phenotype (SASP) via p65 NF-kB. The work outlined in this proposal aims to (1) elucidate the
mechanistic explanations for the observed transcriptional vulnerabilities unique to LKB1 mutant tumors,
and to (2) define how the HDAC3 protein complex regulates the SASP and immune cell recruitment to
impact lung tumor growth control. Experiments will determine HDAC3 and NKX2-1 genomic binding
patterns and interacting partners specific to LKB1-mutant cells, whether Class IIa HDACs contribute to
the LKB1 specificity of HDAC3 function, and therapeutic response to HDAC3 inhibition in LKB1-mutant
tumors. These studies will also define how HDAC3 impacts p65 genome binding and activity, identify which
Nuclear Receptors are required for HDAC3 repression of the SASP, and profile the HDAC3-dependent
intratumoral immune infiltrate and its contribution to growth control in vivo. Insights gained from this work
will contribute to the understanding of key LKB1-specific transcriptional pathways and how they may be
impinged upon therapeutically. This research also aims to define the mechanism mediating HDAC3
control of the SASP, which will facilitate exploration of key questions about SASP involvement in tumor
growth control more broadly. The candidate holds a Ph.D. in Biochemistry and is currently completing her
post-doctoral training with Dr. Reuben Shaw at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. The candidateâs
career goal is to obtain a tenure-track faculty position studying transcriptional deregulation in cancer.
These studies will provide the foundation for a continued research program in this important, emerging
area of cancer research."
10599074,"Human blood pressure and stress/immune responses are controlled by the steroid
hormones aldosterone and cortisol, respectively. There are multiple disease states in
which these hormones are overproduced and for which selective inhibitors would be
clinically beneficial. However, the development of selective inhibitors of aldosterone
production by cytochrome P450 11B2 (CYP11B2) and cortisol production by cytochrome
P450 11B1 (CYP11B1) has been frustrated by their 93% amino acid sequence identity.
The current proposal seeks to rectify this gap in knowledge by determining structural
features of CYP11B1 that underlie functional differences from CYP11B2. The central
hypothesis is that structural and functional studies will reveal unique CYP11B1
characteristics that could be harnessed to support the design of isoform-selective drugs.
To probe differences in CYP11B enzyme interactions with ligands, we will determine Xray
structures of CYP11B1 with its substrate and several inhibitors that currently under
development but are non-optimal because of poor selectivity. Preliminary data suggests
structural differences compared to the existing corresponding CYP11B2 structure,
distinctions that might be exploited clinically (aim 1). Preliminary data also suggests that
the shared required redox partner adrenodoxin interacts differently with the two CYP11B
enzymes, which may provide an orthogonal approach to selective inhibitionâone that
doesnât focus on the active site. Thus an X-ray structure will also be determined for
CYP11B1 interacting with adrenodoxin by employing a fusion protein approach (aim 2).
The final aim probes different conformations of CYP11B1 that are likely to exist in
solution and in the membrane where this protein is normally embedded. All membrane
P450 structures have been determined by X-ray crystallography and packing
interactions occur via the membrane-binding surface through which ligands enter/exit.
Thus, while these proteins are known to be flexible and dynamic, X-ray crystallography
often only reveals one form, which may not be the most appropriate conformation for
inhibitor design. Application of cryo-EM to CYP11B1 (aim 3) is an orthogonal approach
to define more relevant conformations of this enzyme. Thus, the proposed research will
determine the structures and define new interactions controlling the activity of CYP11B1.
Contrasting this new information with CYP11B2 can subsequently be used to facilitate
the development of clinically-relevant molecules inhibitors specific for each enzyme."

10588131,"At the end of life, being free from pain is among the top wishes for patients with advanced cancer. Despite
multimodal palliative care, pain remains one of the most common symptoms for those with advanced cancer.
Not only do high pain scores place patients at significant risk for emergency department visits and hospital
readmission, high pain scores also are associated with increased suffering. For patients with advanced cancer
who have failed interdisciplinary palliative care, minimally-invasive approaches to lesion spinal cord pain
pathways can be considered. A particularly promising procedure is cordotomy, in which a lesion is placed in
the spinothalamic tract to treat patients with unilateral arm, leg, or chest wall pain due to cancer.
To understand the role of cordotomy in the palliative care setting, we have conducted a prospective clinical trial
to determine the extent to which cordotomy can reduce advanced cancer pain. Sixteen patients with
advanced cancer who had undergone optimized palliative care treatment were randomized to either undergo
cordotomy or continue comprehensive palliative care. Six out of the seven patients randomized to cordotomy
experienced greater than a 33% improvement in pain, while none of the nine patients randomized to continued
palliative care improved. Based on this preliminary data, we hypothesize that cordotomy improves
advanced cancer pain in selected patients undergoing concurrent interdisciplinary palliative care.
Despite these encouraging results, it is well documented that surgical pain interventions can have a significant
placebo effect. To control for placebo effects, we will undertake a single-institution, sham controlled clinical
trial of cordotomy in patients with refractory cancer pain who are undergoing interdisciplinary palliative care.
Our preliminary data also supports that cordotomy reduces the interference of pain on activities of daily living.
We therefore hypothesize that cordotomy aligns well with patient goals towards the end of life. To test this
hypothesis, we will use qualitative research methodology to study patients with refractory cancer pain who
undergo cordotomy. Patients will be interviewed about their experience before, during, and after cordotomy.
Finally, our data supports that MRI diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can detect structural changes induced by
cordotomy, and that DTI metrics correlate with pain improvement after cordotomy. We will test the hypothesis
that post-procedure MRI can noninvasively predict pain outcome after cordotomy.
Results from this study will be critical in establishing the role of cordotomy in the treatment of advanced cancer
pain, and will facilitate the implementation of this treatment nationally."
10848459,"Blood-brain barrier dysfunction is recognized as both a cause and consequence of seizures in epilepsy. Two key
characteristics of barrier dysfunction in epilepsy include 1) neurovascular inflammation and 2) barrier leakage,
both of which have been linked to seizures. In spite of increasing evidence supporting that glutamate causes
blood-brain barrier dysfunction, knowledge of the associated underlying mechanisms remain to be fully defined.
Moreover, therapeutic options for restoring barrier function are currently not available. Thus, there is an unmet
critical need to determine how glutamate promotes blood-brain barrier inflammation and leakage and to develop
targeted strategies to restore barrier function. The consequence of this unmet need is that development of novel
treatments to improve seizure control in epilepsy will likely remain a clinical challenge. The long-term goal of the
investigator is to contribute toward the development of mechanism-based strategies to repair blood-brain barrier
dysfunction in brain diseases. The overall objective in this application is to establish the efficacy of a mechanism-
based intervention to treat blood-brain barrier dysfunction in epilepsy, thereby vertically extending what has been
learned under current funding. Based on preliminary data the central hypothesis of this project is that glutamate
signaling mediates blood-brain barrier dysfunction and that therapeutic intervention targeting this mechanism
will resolve seizure-induced neurovascular inflammation, repair barrier leakage, and reduce seizure burden. The
rationale for the proposed research is that its successful completion will provide a robust framework for the
continued development and clinical translation of a novel evidence-based therapeutic intervention to help treat
seizures in patients with epilepsy. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Identify
signaling steps responsible for seizure-induced inflammation of the blood-brain barrier. 2) Determine the
mechanism responsible for capillary leakage at the human blood-brain barrier, and 3) Develop a therapeutic
intervention to reduce seizure burden in a chronic epilepsy model. Under Aim 1, signaling steps that lead to
seizure-mediated neuroinflammation will be determined in capillaries isolated from knockout mouse models and
verified in vivo. Under Aim 2, key signaling steps that trigger barrier leakage will be determined in human brain
capillaries from seizure-free control individuals and from patients with epilepsy. Under Aim 3, an intervention
therapy designed to repair barrier dysfunction will be developed and the therapeutic benefit of this strategy on
reducing seizure burden will be evaluated in a rat chronic epilepsy model. The proposed research is innovative,
because it represents a substantive departure from the status quo by shifting the focus to molecular targets at
the blood-brain barrier to resolve neurovascular inflammation, restore barrier function, and improve epilepsy
symptoms. The proposed research is significant because it holds the promise of a novel therapeutic approach
to repair barrier dysfunction that has translational potential for clinical use to advance treatment of patients with
epilepsy and other seizure disorders with underlying barrier dysfunction."
10738737,"ABSTRACT â OVERALL
HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are protective in animal models of HIV-1 infection, but are not
elicited in humans by current vaccine regimens. To elicit bnAbs, the B cell lineage vaccine design approach aims
to administer multiple immunogens in a specific sequence to shepherd bnAb maturation through immunologic
roadblocks that typically halt bnAb development. One roadblock we recently identified are somatic mutations
that encode key amino acids for antibody function but that are rarely made by the somatic mutation enzyme
activation-induced cytidine deaminase. Our central vaccine design hypothesis is that antibodies (Abs)
encoding these improbable mutations, will be rare; thus, vaccine immunogens will need to have higher affinity
for Abs with these desired amino acid changes than Abs without the amino acid changes in order to select for
them. The problem facing this strategy is that the only antigen for HIV-1 bnAbs is HIV-1 envelope (Env), which
is poorly immunogenic and for which bnAb precursors generally have low affinity. We and others have found
these two obstacles can be overcome by designing Envs with high affinity for bnAb precursors and by
multimerizing these Envs on nanoparticles (NPs) to provide avidity and improved antigen trafficking to germinal
centers. However, Env trimer NPs can have low expression and present misfolded Env trimers that elicit
undesired non-neutralizing Abs. This application is significant because it will establish a cGMP-compliant
vaccine platform that rapidly generates higher quality HIV-1 Env trimer NP vaccines without time-consuming
iterative immunogen design. This platform uses the sortase A enzyme to site-specifically, covalently-link well-
folded HIV-1 Env trimers to intact Helicobacter pylori ferritin NPs. The resultant HIV-1 Env trimer sortase A-
conjugated NPs (scNPs) display only well-folded Env trimers, and in preliminary studies, have successfully
initiated CD4 binding site bnAb lineages in human bnAb precursor knock-in mice and CD4bs nAbs in rhesus
macaques. The scNP platform is universal in nature since it can incorporate diverse viral type I fusion proteins
by simply adding a 6-amino acid sortase A tag to their C-terminus. In Specific Aim 1, we will compare the ability
of monovalent and bivalent HIV-1 Env scNPs to guide affinity maturation of CD4 binding site bnAbs in humanized
mice and rhesus macaques. In Specific Aim 2, we will produce and assemble two CD4 binding site-bnAb-
targeting HIV-1 Env trimer scNPs (CH505 TF scNP and a second sequential Env trimer scNP) under cGMP
conditions. This program will deliver an optimized cGMP process for making scNPs, two cGMP-produced Env
trimer scNPs, and additional ferritin and sortase A components for the manufacture of future immunogens. The
CH505 TF Env trimer scNPs will be used in a Phase I trial through the HIV Vaccine Trial Network. Ultimately,
the impact of this platform is that it will enable multiple Env trimer scNPs to be made rapidly under cGMP, making
it feasible to do iterative testing in clinical trials of complete sequential nanoparticle vaccines that target bnAbs."

A better understanding of the DNA damage response (DDR) is of utmost importance because this
evolutionally-conserved genome-maintaining mechanism not only serves as an anti-cancer barrier, but
influences efficacies of radiation therapy and chemotherapy that mainly kill cancer cells by inducing DNA
damage. Whereas DNA is embedded in highly-ordered chromatin, DNA damage promptly induces chromatin
alterations at sites of damage. One such early change, histone acetylation catalyzed by histone
acetyltransferases Tip60 and p300/CBP, not only can promote chromatin access to the DNA-repair machinery,
but can regulate DNA-repair pathway choice. As histone acetylation has emerged as a principal mechanism for
coordinating DDR, it is of significance to identify genes that can regulate this event upon DNA damage.
Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is a stress sensor commonly induced by DNA-damaging agents. We
have demonstrated that ATF3 can activate the tumor suppressor p53 while promoting Tip60-mediated
activation of the major DDR kinase ATM. We also found that ATF3 is required for genome maintenance and
the suppression of spontaneous tumorigenesis in mice. Whereas these results support that ATF3 plays an
indispensable role in the DNA damage response, what is currently unknown is whether ATF3 can also actively
regulate chromatin dynamics and DNA repair independent of its regulation on p53 and Tip60. The objective of
this application is to address this question, and to determine the role of ATF3 in the regulation of DNA repair at
the chromatin level. Formulated on the basis of compelling preliminary data, the central hypothesis is that
ATF3 recruited to sites of DNA damage promotes p300/CBP to acetylate H3 facilitating the loading of repair
proteins for non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). To test this hypothesis, we will determine how ATF3 is
recruited to DSBs and promotes p300/CBP-catalyzed histone acetylation at DSBs (Aim 1). We will also
delineate how histone acetylation regulated by ATF3 alters chromatin structure and facilitates the recruitments
of NHEJ factors (Aim 2). Lastly, we will also use the IR-induced lymphomagenesis mouse model to assess the
functional significance of our novel findings (Aim 3). Completion of the proposed research is expected to define
a novel role that ATF3 plays in genome maintenance, and discover novel mechanisms by which the early
chromatin response to DNA damage is regulated."
10599154,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Cochlear nerve deficiency (CND) refers to a small or absent cochlear nerve (CN) as revealed by high-
resolution magnetic resonance imaging. Cochlear implantation has been used as a treatment option for children
with CND for nearly two decades. Due to the lack of understanding of how electrical stimulation is encoded and
processed in their auditory system, there is still no evidenced-based clinical practice for managing this unique
patient population. To further complicate matters, more than half of children with CND cannot provide reliable
behavioral responses despite their age due to severe comorbidities. As a result, clinicians often use a combined
âone-size-fits-allâ and âtry-and-seeâ approach to program cochlear implant (CI) speech processors for children
with CND. This practice typically results in stimulating all intra-cochlear CI electrodes with similar programming
parameters. However, recent work from our lab showed that the likelihood of measuring CN neural responses
in children with CND reduced as the stimulating CI electrode site moved from the base to the apex of the cochlea.
This unique response-deterioration pattern is not observed in children with normal-sized CNs. In addition, our
compiling preliminary data show that information transmitted by CI electrodes with no measurable CN response
is only adequate for auditory detection but not sufficient for auditory discrimination, which explains why the
majority of children with CND do not make satisfactory progress in speech and language development despite
good auditory detection thresholds with their CIs. These new findings suggest that the current clinical practice is
unlikely to provide appropriate CI programming settings for this unique patient population. Therefore, there is an
urgent need to develop objective clinical tools for optimizing CI settings for individual children with CND. As the
first step toward developing such objective clinical tools, this study aims to better understand neural encoding
and processing of electrical stimulation in both the CN and the central auditory system in implanted children with
CND. Aim 1 will compare effects of changing pulse-phase duration, inter-phase gap and pulse rate on neural
representation of electrical stimulation in the CN between children with CND and children with normal-sized CNs.
Aim 2 will determine effects of variation in CN neural survival on cortical sensitivity to amplitude modulation and
electrode discrimination in children with CND and children with normal-sized CNs. Results of this study have
high scientific significance because they will establish how variations in neural survival of CN fibers affect neural
encoding of electrical stimulation in the CN, as well as how variations in the peripheral input affect cortical neural
encoding and processing of electrical stimulation. Results of this study also have high clinical significance
because they will 1) provide scientific evidence for identifying and excluding the nonfunctional intra-cochlear CI
electrodes from programming maps, 2) establish the importance of selecting pulse-phase durations, inter-phase
gaps and pulse rates based on CN neural survival for individual CI electrodes, and 3) lay the knowledge
foundation for developing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for managing children with CND."
10598070,"Neonatal Brachial Plexus Palsy (NBPP) is a complication of childbirth that can result in significant long-term
sequelae. NBPP associated injuries often include cases of spinal cord injury (SCI) and are very poorly
understood. Our long-term research goals are to develop both prevention and treatment strategies for NBPP.
Consequently, objectives of this study are to use our novel and unique clinically-relevant neonatal piglet model:
a) To identify brachial plexus (BP) strains and forces that lead to morphological and functional SCI by
investigating the effects of BP stretch on acute pathology and functionality within the spinal cord (SC), b) To
investigate clinically-relevant systemic biomarkers for early diagnosis of SCI during NBPP, and c) To develop
computational models of maternal pelvis and fetus that predict risk of NBPP and associated SCI during
complicated NBPP delivery scenarios. Based on our preliminary work, our central hypothesis is that moderate
to severe BP stretches will transmit forces to SC resulting in SC tissue damage, which are also observable as
high expression of systemic injury biomarkers in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid, and suppression or loss of
motor neuron excitability. Our innovative approach is aimed at developing new knowledge of acute NBPP injury
mechanisms and report SCI tolerance values of BP strains and forces. These data will enable novel clinical tools
for diagnosis and prevention, as well as suggest targets for early clinical interventions for NBPP. We will test the
overall hypothesis through the following independent specific aims: 1) To determine whether moderate to
severe BP stretches will lead to SCI as evident by acute SCI markers in situ, functional loss in motor
neurons and systemic acute SCI biomarkers, and 2) To identify delivery maneuvers and NBPP risk
factors that lead to abnormal BP strains and forces, increasing the likelihood of associated SCI. The
expected outcomes of this work are the first ever data on: 1) morphological and functional injury outcomes that
help determine SCI tolerance values of BP strains and forces during BP stretch, 2) molecular biomarkers that
can enable early diagnosis of SCI, and 3) developing highly biofidelic computational models for NBPP prediction
and obstetric training. The results will also have an important positive impact, because, they lay the groundwork
to develop a new class of targeted clinical interventions."
10799588,"Project Summary. Metacognition is the ability to reflect on and evaluate oneâs behavior. Impaired metacognition
has been proposed as a major symptom for a number of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, depression,
generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and even substance abuse. Deficits in metacog-
nition have further been found after brain lesions. Such deficits can have severe detrimental effects on patients;
treating them requires insight into the computational and neural substrates of metacognition. However, efforts in
this direction have been hampered by a lack of an overarching framework that can inform computational models
of confidence, the measurement of metacognitive ability, and the investigation of the neural bases of metacog-
nition. This proposal will advance a novel theoretical framework based on the concept of hierarchical noise ar-
chitecture. Perceptual decision making will be used as a model system but the architecture is perfectly general
and expected to apply across all domains of metacognition. According to the hierarchical noise architecture (1)
sensory noise corrupts the decision-level representation of the stimulus thus affecting both the perceptual and
confidence judgments, whereas (2) an additional metacognitive noise corrupts confidence but not the perceptual
judgment. The proposed architecture makes a novel prediction â namely, that higher sensory noise should be
more detrimental to the perceptual decisions than the confidence rating â that is supported by strong preliminary
data. More importantly, this architecture can be used to extract a new, model-based measure of metacognitive
ability with desirable psychometric properties such as being independent from participantsâ bias for high or low
confidence. This new measure can therefore be used to examine the effectiveness of treatments on patientsâ
metacognitive abilities: for example, if a patient with deficiency in metacognition changes her strategy and starts
using high confidence more, the new measure â but not previous measures â will remain unchanged. Beyond
predicting new behavioral phenomena and leading to an improved measure of metacognitive ability, the hierar-
chical noise architecture can also elucidate the neural bases of metacognition. Specifically, the functional roles
postulated by the hierarchical noise model can be linked directly to the functions of large-scale brain networks
and especially the central executive and the salience networks. These links will be established using a variety of
techniques such as causally interfering with different nodes of these networks, correlating metacognitive ability
with the connectivity within these networks, and examining the dynamics of the inter-network communication
during confidence generation. The insights gained by this proposal will have a direct link to work in the clinic by
providing researchers a better tool to assess the metacognitive deficits of patients (including the effectiveness
of proposed treatments) and link such dysfunction to specific brain circuits. This work is thus expected to benefit
patients suffering a range of diseases from schizophrenia to depression to substance abuse."
10627754,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Survival rates in patients with oral cavity tumors have remained nearly stagnant in the
past decade with exceptional morbidity e.g., tongue cancers. The goal of this Academic-Industry Partnership
(AIP) application is to develop, for the first time, a single theranostic agent namely targeted Dual Function
Antibody Conjugate (DFAC) amenable to deep tissue photoacoustic imaging (PAI) with targeted photodynamic
therapy (PDT), and an integrated PAI-ultrasound imaging (USI) module for surgery guidance such that the two
main barriers to oral cancer treatment outcomes are overcome. Difficulty in gauging the depth of tumor invasion
during surgical resection and residual microscopic disease are the two main barriers responsible for the high
loco-regional recurrence rates in oral cavity tumors. Cautionary removal of extra normal tissue leads to functional
loss and a compromised quality of life. Through this AIP, we establish a collaborative framework between the
academic research lab of Dr. Hasan at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), the clinical Otolaryngology
surgical team of Drs. Varvares and August at Mass Eye and Ear Infirmary and MGH, and the Akita Innovations
industry team, to create a comprehensive theranostic solution that enables deep tissue image-guided, normal
tissue-sparing surgery and tumor-targeted spatially-localized therapy in the oral cavity. Our synergistic scientific
expertise, respective infrastructures, clinical translation experience and geographic proximity position us well to
achieve our goals. The proposal has 3 parts that will enable deep tissue image-guided surgery and treat residual
disease in one intraoperative setting. 1. A DFAC, that enables both imaging and therapy by targeting Epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR), an established biomarker in oral cavity tumors, 2. A custom-built, PAI integrated
clinical USI module for surgical guidance. 3. Targeted PDT. DFAC is composed of cetuximab, an FDA-approved
EGFR targeting antibody, conjugated to a new near-infrared (>850 nm) napthalocyanine dye for deep-tissue PAI
and an FDA-approved photosensitizer Benzoporphyrin Derivative (BPD). We postulate that DFAC-enabled
deep-tissue PAI- guided surgery and intraoperative PDT of residual disease will achieve local tumor control,
reduce recurrence, increase disease-free survival and improve quality of life in oral cancer patients. The concept
will be validated pre-clinically and clinically in 4 specific aims: Aim-1 Development and in vitro optimization of
DFACs for photoacoustic contrast and therapeutic efficacy. Optimize clinical intra-oral USI systems to PAI via
customized light delivery strategies and spectroscopic algorithms. Aim-2. Perform rodent toxicology studies,
GMP production of DFAC and obtain eIND approvals. Aim-3. Evaluation of therapeutic efficacy in mouse models
of oral cancer. Aim-4. Implementation of first-in-human Phase 0 clinical trial with DFAC-guided PAI ability to
delineate deep tumor margins. Relevance: The study offers deep tissue imaging and targeted therapy in a single
intraoperative session, resulting in lower recurrence, lower cost, higher overall survival and improved quality of
life. The modular design of DFAC and integrated PAI-US, enables adaptation of the platform to other cancers."
10764189,"Project Summary/Abstract
Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a major public health concern affecting nearly 30 million people in the U.S. and
increasing their risk for serious complications including blindness, amputations, kidney failure, heart attacks
and strokes. Forty five percent (45%) of people with diabetes report considerable stress related to their
diabetes, which is increasingly being recognized as a key factor in worsening glucose control and the
progression of T2DM. The proposed project uses mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a powerful and
well researched mindfulness-based intervention, to address stress as a critical barrier to glucose control in
patients with T2DM. The objective of this proposal is to conduct a large, fully-powered randomized controlled
trial (RCT) to definitively determine the effects of a 6-month MBSR intervention on glucose control in patients
with uncontrolled T2DM. We will randomize 290 adults with uncontrolled T2DM to a 6-month MBSR
intervention or health education control. The 6-month intervention will consist of the University of
Massachusetts standard 8-week MBSR program followed by monthly MBSR booster sessions. Outcomes will
be assessed at baseline, 8-weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Specific Aims are: 1) To conduct a RCT to
determine the effects of a 6-month MBSR intervention compared to health education on glucose control in 290
patients with uncontrolled T2DM. The primary outcome will be hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a measure of average
glucose levels over the past 3 months. We hypothesize that between the two groups, there will be a clinically
significant 0.5% absolute difference in the mean change in HbA1c from baseline to month 6. Additionally, we
will look at fasting glucose and glucose variability as they are also linked with adverse outcomes; 2) To
determine the effects of MBSR versus health education control on psychosocial, behavioral and physiological
mechanisms potentially mediating its glucose-lowering effects in patients with uncontrolled T2DM. Subjective
stress, diabetes-related distress and other psychosocial measures will be assessed. Accelerometry will be
used to track physical activity. Unannounced phone calls will be used to obtain 24 hour diet recalls. Physiologic
measures include serum hsCRP and TNF-Î± as markers of chronic inflammation, salivary cortisol to assess the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and salivary Î±-amylase to assess sympathetic nervous system activity.
The proposed study has the potential to transform current standards of care for T2DM by using a novel long-
term MBSR intervention as a powerful adjunct intervention for T2DM. MBSR could impact the clinical picture of
T2DM by empowering patients with skills for strengthening their own internal resources to promote self-
regulation and adaptive coping and reduce stress reactivity, which are all essential for implementing healthy
behaviors and are expected to lead to improved glucose control and reduced risk of diabetes complications.
This proposal is relevant to the mission of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases (NIDDK) to conduct research on diabetes to improve people's health and quality of life."
10578725,"Project Summary / Abstract
A rural/urban disparity in mortality of 8% has been observed for lung, colorectal, prostate, breast, and cervical
cancers. Physical inactivity is a modifiable cancer risk factor; physical activity (PA) is associated with risk
reductions between 10-20% for breast, colon, and 6 other cancers. Further, rural residents report
approximately 24% lower PA compared to urban residents. Primary care providers are a trusted source of
health advice and they are in an ideal position to assess PA and advise patients regarding becoming and
staying physically active. It is estimated that 84.3% of adults had an appointment with a primary health care
professional in 2018. Thus, primary care encounters provide an opportunity to promote PA among the majority
of rural adults, particularly among those with chronic disease profiles placing them at elevated cancer risk (e.g.,
overweight, obesity, diabetes). There is substantial evidence demonstrating the success of primary care
providers promoting PA. Advice from providers is most effective in creating sustainable increases in PA when
followed by phone or community-based support. The first challenge to implementing this type of approach in
rural settings is the need for a methodology to train rural primary care providers to promote PA. We propose to
apply the well validated ECHO Model to train providers toward the goal of communicating the health benefits of
PA to patients, making clear recommendations, and connecting them to PA resources. Additional challenges to
promoting PA in rural residents are provision of behavioral support and ensuring adequate opportunities for
PA. These activities are beyond the scope of practice for primary care providers. We propose to partner with
the Harrisburg YMCA to create a âMoveLineâ â logistically, the PA equivalent to the highly successful smoking
cessation âQuitLineâ. Providers will refer patients to the MoveLine, who will then counsel and connect patients
to PA options available in their communities. Study staff and a community advisory board (CAB), in
collaboration with the YMCA, Penn State Extension, and Penn State (PSU) faculty will work to identify existing
PA options and to expand them as well. While intervening on the built environment is beyond the scope of this
application, we acknowledge the import of environment on PA by rigorously evaluating its impact on outcomes.
We propose a multi-level group randomized trial, including provider advice (patient), coaching and MoveLine
(patient, social), and educating and promoting community PA opportunities and programs (community). We
also evaluate the impact of the built environment on PA outcomes. We propose this work in collaboration with
the Primary Health Network (8 Federally Qualified Health Clinics serving rural Pennsylvania), Penn State
Health (8 clinics serving rural Pennsylvania), the Harrisburg YMCA, and Penn State Extension to increase PA
levels in rural Pennsylvanians, toward the goal of reducing cancer risk. A total of 16 clinics will be randomized
to the immediate or delayed treatment condition (2-3 providers nested within each clinic and 20 patients nested
within each provider; 800 patients in total)."

Children of women exposed to childhood abuse exhibit increased risk for a wide array of neurodevelopmental
deficits, including elevated risk of anxiety, depression, and social problems. Our studies have found that these
children had a more than three-fold higher risk of autism and 70% higher risk of attention-deficit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD). Animal studies similarly find that maternal exposure to stressors is associated with offspring
anxiety, depressive symptoms, and attention problems and decreased social behavior. Neurodevelopmental
disorders are common and carry lifelong, costly burdens. Yet, extant research has failed to identify pathways
by which children of women abused are at risk of harm. Identification of such pathways is a critical step in
preventing neurodevelopmental deficits in these children. The present research focuses on three likely
pathways that have largely been unexamined. We will identify biological dysregulation during pregnancy in
women exposed versus unexposed to abuse in two systems: hormonal function and immune function.
Dysregulation in these biological systems is known to harm offspring neurodevelopment and is present in
adults who have experienced childhood abuse, yet it is largely unknown whether dysregulation in these
systems occurs during the pregnancies of women exposure to abuse. We will collect biological samples to
measure the functioning of these systems in a large, prospective cohort of pregnant women. Second, we will
examine whether women who experienced abuse carry higher genetic loading for neuropsychiatric disorders
by calculating genetic risk scores for 5 disorders including autism and ADHD in more than 8000 women.
Genetically informed studies indicate that genetic variation plays a role in increased risk of negative
neurodevelopmental outcomes in children of women abused. However, to date no studies have used genome-
wide data to address this question. Our proposed study is uniquely suited to greatly expand our understanding
of how childhood abuse affects health across generations and to inform interventions to protect the healthy
development of children. This information is critical to establish public health priorities and to determine the
optimal type and timing of interventions to prevent neurodevelopmental harm to children."
10820481,"Project Summary/Abstract
The mucosal system of the female reproductive tract (FRT) is multifactorial, combining epithelial and mucus
barriers, a highly specialized immunology, the microbiome, and hormonal fluctuations to protect this complex
and essential organ from attack by pathogenâs such as HIV. Perturbation of any of the components of this
system has the potential to decrease barrier function while potentially increasing a womanâs vulnerability to HIV
sexual acquisition. Recent studies have revealed that an increase in the presence of multiple (more than 3)
pro-inflammatory cytokines are a strong signature of increased HIV acquisition in women. This increased
inflammatory environment is consistent with the dysfunction of normal mucosal barrier function. A number of
factors have been implicated in this inflammatory state including hormones, the microbiome, and epithelial
barrier disruption. However, the origin of these inflammatory cytokines and the mechanism of how they are
related to increased HIV acquisition is not understood. To advance HIV prevention science, we need a better
understanding of the FRT mucosal system. In this project we will examine hysterectomy derived cervical
tissues and mucus donated by high-risk populations in Nairobi, Kenya to gain insight into the changes in the
mucosal system that alters epithelial and mucus barrier function. The increased Inflammatory cytokine
production can directly or indirectly influence tissue resident HIV target cells to increase the probability of
sexual transmission. Our hypothesis is that target cells become more susceptible to HIV infection by infiltrating
into the squamous epithelium of the FRT in response to the increased inflammatory cytokines. We will also
examine how antibodies can potentially enhance the mucus barrier function potentially revealing a novel
strategy for HIV vaccine development."

The mortality rates of breast and pancreatic cancers are intrinsically tied to metastasis. In pancreatic cancer, the
5-year survival rate is only 9% and in ~70% pathological evaluations of the resected tumor, instances of venous
invasion are found. Metastasis is a complex multi-step process involving cancer cells, local vasculature, and the
surrounding microenvironment at multiple sites. Venous invasion in pancreatic cancer, in which cancer cells gain
often invade the portal vein, is an early step in this process and provides the cells a direct path to the liver, the
most common site of pancreatic cancer metastasis. As in pancreatic cancer, invasion past normal breast tissue
barriers is critically tied to breast cancer outcomes. Most breast tumors can be surgically removed, and so
mortality is closely tied to the extent of distant metastasis through lymphovascular invasion. The detection of
lymphovascular invasion in a breast tumor correlates with poor prognosis and is not captured in current molecular
analyses. The spatial organization of cancer cells, and cellular and stromal components of the tumor
microenvironment near and far away from blood vessels is intrinsically three-dimensional, non-symmetric, and
highly heterogeneous. In the TECH units of the Johns Hopkins Center for 3D Multiscale Cancer Imaging, we
will develop a versatile 3D multiscale imaging method, CODA, which will allow us to probe the phenotypic
heterogeneity of tumors from the multi-cm to the micron scale via multiplexing serial imaging. CODA can readily
incorporate other imaging modalities to extract high cellular/molecular content from 3D samples. These include
immunocytochemistry (CODA+IHC), immunofluorescence (CODA+IF), imaging mass cytometry (CODA+IMC)
and spatial transcriptomics/proteomics (CODA+DBiT-seq). These proposed expanded versions of CODA offer
a unique opportunity to produce new 3D multi-omic maps of human PDAC and breast tumors near and far from
blood vessels. CODA and its integrated versions CODA+X will be tested in the RTB units of the Center in both
human/mouse tissue samples and organoids, in breast and pancreatic cancer. Results from these test beds will
provide novel mechanistic insights into venous invasion in breast and pancreatic cancer. Exploiting our extensive
experience in data dissemination, we will make the large datasets and software produced by our CODA+X
platforms and software widely available to the larger cancer research community. The units of the Center will be
co-led by Johns Hopkins/Yale engineers, scientists and physicians. Substantial additional support will be
provided by the Johns Hopkins U., the JH School of Medicine, the Institute for Convergence, the Department of
Pathology, and the Whiting School of Engineering."
10749866,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Functional MRI (fMRI) is the most widely-used tool to noninvasively measure brain function and has produced
much of our current knowledge about the functional organization of the human brain. All fMRI methods, however,
measure neuronal activity indirectly by tracking the associated local changes in blood flow and oxygenation.
While this is often viewed as a limitation of fMRI, recent optical imaging studies in animal models have shown
that, surprisingly, the smallest blood vessels in the brain respond rapidly to local neuronal activity, and are thus
tightly coupled to neurons, suggesting that fMRI could provide a far more veridical picture of neuronal activity
than previously believedâif one can measure fMRI signals such as BOLD exclusively from the microvasculature.
 In the previous funding cycle, we successfully tested our hypothesis that the neuronal specificity of fMRI can
be improved by restricting analyses to the earliest phases of the standard gradient-echo BOLD response, thought
to occur in the microvasculature, before the responses spread to larger blood vessels and become less spatially
localized. The ability to reliably extract the earliest phases of the BOLD response was achieved through the fast
temporal sampling made possible through the fMRI acquisition technologies we developed. Our findings were
consistent with our hypothesisâthe fastest component of the BOLD response provides the highest
microvascular specificity. Here we test the converse hypothesis: that BOLD signals from the microvasculature
are fastest and exhibit the highest temporal specificity, while signals from the macrovasculature are temporally
delayed and smeared. To test this we will develop technologies for spin-echo BOLD, which exclusively measures
from the microvasculature, with fast temporal sampling. In this cycle our central hypothesis is that spin-echo
BOLD with exclusive sensitivity to the microvasculature, will yield higher temporal specificity than gradient-echo
BOLD, which contains slower signals from the macrovasculature. The challenge is that spin-echo acquisitions
in theory provide T2 weighting, endowing spin-echo BOLD with microvascular specificity, however in practice it
is difficult to achieve pure T2 weighting. Thus, our goals are to develop and validate fMRI technologies for robust
pure T2-weighted BOLD, and to test whether pure T2-weighted BOLD provides higher temporal specificity.
 These goals can only be achieved by combining several novel MRI technologies we have recently
introduced. The core technology is Echo-Planar Time-Resolved Imaging (EPTI), an extension to Echo-Planar
Imaging (EPI), which can provide pure T2-weighted BOLDâconcurrently with T2*-weighted BOLD, enabling
direct comparisons. We will combine this with our new methods for increasing temporal sampling efficiency
through and motion-robustness, and maximizing signal when using fast sampling rates. Finally, all experiments
will be performed at 7 Tesla, where BOLD exhibits stronger microvascular weighting and higher sensitivity
compared to standard field strengths, using parallel transmit RF pulse designs to reduce power deposition and
improve the spatial uniformity of fMRI sensitivity."
10610375,"Sexual and gender minorities (SGMs) have been documented in every region of the world. In spite of reported
abuse, discrimination and stigma, little is known about their mental health (MH). Even less is known about the
development of appropriate MH treatment interventions. Evidence-based treatments (EBTs) addressing poor
MH are being implemented in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) using appropriate, affordable and
sustainable delivery modalities (e.g. lay providers, mHealth). These advances create opportunities to provide
MH care to SGMs not previously possible. To develop and implement EBTs, longitudinal research is necessary
to inform us of the unique MH needs, determinants and treatment preferences of this understudied population.
 Pilot data for this study suggest that: SGMs can be identified and recruited in LMICs across SGM groups;
prevalence of depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and posttraumatic stress disorder among SGMs is
extremely high; and there are variations in MH symptomatology and determinants by SGM group and country.
There is an urgent need for longitudinal cohort studies that include SGMs from heterogeneous LMICs to
understand the influence of culture and context on MH needs, predictors and EBT preferences, and to develop
locally sustainable EBTs and methods for generalizability. Inclusion of methods (i.e. Discrete Choice
Experiments) that identify optimal EBT approaches specific to SGM groups, culture and context will accelerate
the translation of observational research to EBT implementation and provide a model that can be used to
identify appropriate EBTs for SGMs in other diverse contexts and low resource settings. The SGM Mental
Health in LMICs (SMILE) study represents paradigm-shifting research by defining SGMs based on gender
identity and attraction -inherent biological characteristics- rather than sexual behavior. SMILE study aims are:
ï· Aim 1: Estimate prevalence of anxiety, depression, PTSD, suicidal ideation and substance abuse
 symptomatology among 7 SGM groups in 3 culturally diverse LMICs (Brazil, Kenya, Vietnam)
ï· Aim 2: Identify cultural, contextual, interpersonal and individual determinants of MH over time, by and
 across SGM group and country.
ï· Aim 3: Determine SGMsâ MH intervention preferences through Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs).
 To accomplish these aims we will use a two-pronged recruitment strategy that includes respondent-driven
sampling and a mass media campaign to develop a cohort of 10,500 SGM (500 participants from 7 SGM
groups in 3 countries). Study participants will complete online surveys at baseline, 12- and 24-months to
assess MH symptomology, determinants, and treatment preferences. DCEs will be developed and included in
the 24-month survey to elicit preferences for EBTs that are SGM group, culture and context specific.
 SMILE addresses all three NIMH priorities identified in the Notice of Special Interest in Research on Health
of SGM Populations (NOT-MD-19-001) and priorities of two other NIH Program Announcements."

The US now requires e-cigarette packaging and advertising to have a single warning about nicotine addiction.
FDA has the authority to require additional e-cigarette warnings and has stated that a single e-cigarette
warning could âgrow stale over time.â No data are available on whether the current or other e-cigarette
warnings affect vaping or undermine the motivation to quit smoking combustible cigarettes. Furthermore, little
data are available on how and for whom e-cigarette warnings work, including among vulnerable populations.
Ideally, e-cigarette warnings would discourage vaping initiation among non-users, reduce vaping among e-
cigarette-only users, and support dual-users eventually quitting use of tobacco products. We propose to
study the impact of the current e-cigarette warning and inform development of appropriate new
warnings. In Aim 1, we will develop new e-cigarette warnings using data from 3 large surveys. We aim to
create warnings that e-cigarette users endorse as being effective and that do not cause unintended
consequences among adolescents, young adults, and adults, especially dual users. This evaluation will include
the current US e-cigarette warning statement about nicotine addiction. The main product of Aim 1 will be the
selection of warnings for use in the Aim 2 RCT. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the impact of e-cigarette
warnings on vaping in an RCT. Young adult and adult e-cigarette users will receive 4 new warnings affixed to
their e-cigarette devices and refills during the 4-week study, allocated in a random order. We will assess
whether the e-cigarette warnings increase e-cigarette quit attempts and examine whether the warnings impact
varies for dual users, vulnerable populations (young adult; low-income; and gay, lesbian, and bisexual [GLB] e-
cigarette users). We will also examine whether the warnings increase Tobacco Warnings Model (TWM)
antecedents to quitting in the context of e-cigarettes. The main product of Aim 2 will be an estimate of the
impact of e-cigarette warnings on vaping, and an understanding of which TWM antecedents to behavior
explain the impact. Finally, in Aim 3, we will examine whether e-cigarette warnings push e-cigarette
users toward smoking. We will examine the impact of e-cigarette warnings on motivation to not smoke
(defined as cigarette quit intentions among dual users, and susceptibility to smoke among e-cigarette only
users), smoking behavior and inaccurate risk perceptions. We will examine if warnings' impact varies for
vulnerable groups and warning size. The final product of Aim 3 will be an estimate of the impact of warnings on
unintended consequences, including pushing people toward smoking. Across the three aims, we will develop
generalizable principles on how to maximize the impact of e-cigarette warnings without pushing dual users
toward smoking. Our findings will create an evidence base that can inform development of effective e-cigarette
warnings, warnings and advertising policy in the US and globally, and other nicotine addiction and cancer
prevention communication and countermarketing campaigns."
10740897,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The role of retrotransposons in human cancer has been historically underappreciated both because they have
been dismissed as unimportant âjunkâ DNA, and because their high repetition and variation pose significant
technical challenges. There are ~500,000 copies of LINE-1 (or L1) retrotransposons occupying 17% of the
human genome, but only ~100 full-length human-specific L1 elements (L1Hs) are capable of active
retrotransposition. L1-encoded proteins also mobilize non-autonomous retrotransposons, noncoding RNAs and
mRNAs, leading to the generation of a third of human DNA. As such, L1s have been considered mostly
deleterious because their activity can lead to genetic mutations and chromosomal alterations that contribute to
human disorders including cancer. By domain-based CRISPR screens of human chromatin regulators, we
identified MPP8, a component of the HUSH complex responsible for the silencing of L1 retrotransposons, as a
selective epigenetic dependency of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. While dispensable for normal
hematopoiesis, MPP8 loss impaired AML initiation and maintenance by reactivating L1s. Ectopic L1 activation
phenocopied MPP8 loss, whereas blocking L1 retrotransposition abrogated the phenotypes. L1 suppression is
associated with therapy resistance and poor prognosis in human AML patients. Hence, while retrotransposons
are historically recognized for their cancer-promoting roles as sources of genetic instability and somatic
mutations, our findings support an unexpected âtumor-suppressiveâ function for retrotransposons as a selective
dependency for myeloid leukemia. The goal of this project is to elucidate the functional and mechanistic roles of
L1 retrotransposons as a new regulatory pathway in AML pathophysiology. The central hypotheses are that L1
retrotransposons function to modulate DNA damage response and/or inflammatory signaling in AML-initiating
cells, and that L1 activity controls therapeutic response to DNA damage-inducing agents in myeloid leukemia.
Our hypotheses have been formulated on the basis of extensive preliminary studies using orthogonal
approaches to modulate L1 function in physiologically relevant AML models and a newly discovered molecular
link between suppression of retrotransposons and propagation of cancer-initiating cells. Guided by these
findings, these hypotheses will be tested by three specific aims: 1) Establish the functional roles of L1
retrotransposons in the clonal evolution of myeloid leukemia. 2) Elucidate the mechanistic roles of L1
retrotransposons in AML pathogenesis. 3) Determine the effects of modulating retrotransposon activity on
therapeutic response to DNA damage-inducing agents in myeloid leukemia. Taken together, these studies will
not only elucidate the mechanistic basis for the unexpected âtumor-suppressiveâ function for retrotransposon
activity in myeloid leukemia, but also establish a new paradigm for mobile DNA elements as a previously
uncharted regulatory pathway in leukemia biology, whose intervention may lead to improved anti-leukemia
therapies."

Peripheral nerve damage following trauma results in catastrophic loss of sensorimotor function if not treated in
a timely manner. In severe cases, surgical repair is required to regain function, but outcomes remain subopti-
mal (with a failure rate reaching 40%). While electrodiagnostics are valuable indicators of nerve function and
muscle denervation, they are often challenging to interpret early post-injury, limiting our ability to determine if
surgical intervention is warranted. After surgery, it can also take many months for electrodiagnostics to indicate
whether axons are sprouting across the repair site and regenerating toward their motor or sensory target. In
both cases, this often results in a âwait and watchâ approach that relies on the clinical manifestations of rein-
nervation (e.g., the return of sensorimotor function), which ultimately delays clinical decision-making and in-
creases the likelihood of permanent muscle atrophy, sensory loss, and the formation of painful neuromas. Giv-
en these limitations, a biomarker that monitors nerve regeneration throughout the recovery process would im-
prove sensorimotor outcomes by allowing for the earlier identification of i) nerves that require surgery and ii)
failed repairs after surgery, even guiding re-operation (when necessary) in the latter case. Diffusion tensor im-
aging (DTI) is an MRI method that yields indices (e.g., fractional anisotropy, FA) sensitive to nerve pathologies.
We previously demonstrated that i) FA values from ex vivo rat nerves relate to axon density and behavioral
outcomes following trauma and surgical repair and ii) FA values from human nerves report on failed surgeries,
successful reoperations, and injury severity. While promising, larger-scale studies are required for clinical vali-
dation given the heterogeneous nature of traumatic nerve injuries. Furthermore, we know that DTI lacks speci-
ficity in the presence of concurrent edema and de/regeneration early after trauma. In line with these challeng-
es, our overarching goal is to move nerve diffusion biomarkers toward clinical trial readiness by i) developing
advanced diffusion methods with increased pathological specificity to regeneration; ii) demonstrating con-
sistency across MRI vendors/sites; iii) and providing clinical validation by expanding to a larger-scale, multi-site
study to evaluate whether pre- and post-surgical diffusion MRI predicts clinical outcomes. This multi-PI project
represents a unique collaboration between scientists with expertise in advanced peripheral nerve MRI and
world-class peripheral nerve surgeons. We will use the complementary technical and clinical expertise of the
team to identify novel diffusion-based biomarkers based on the spherical mean technique (SMT) and opti-
mize/evaluate performance. We hypothesize that SMT parameters predict surgical outcomes with higher levels
of sensitivity and specificity than both DTI and standard clinical methods. If successful, these SMT-based bi-
omarkers will allow physicians to recommend surgical interventions and detect failed repairs earlier than is cur-
rently possible. Once established, these methods will also likely be of clinical utility in proximal injuries, where
the prognosis for recovery is currently poor due to the prolonged time required to detect failed regeneration."

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) negatively impacts the social and sexual quality of life in up to 20% of women in the
US. Interstitial cystitis/ bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS), which affects 6.5% of women in the US, is one of the
most debilitating CPP conditions. Pelvic floor overactivity (PFOA) is prevalent among patients with CPP and
presents in up to 85% of women with IC/BPS. Conservative treatment strategies employ physical therapy
interventions that include manual soft tissue mobilization, dilation, and muscle retraining. When conservative
therapies fail, injection therapies may be indicated. Specifically, botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT, or
onabotulinumtoxinA) has received growing interest in managing PFOA. BoNT blocks acetylcholine release,
thereby inhibiting neuromuscular transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). By inhibiting neuromuscular
transmission in spastic muscles, transient muscle relaxation commences, and pain is relieved. Despite its
potency and safety, BoNT can cause dose-dependent adverse effects and is expensive. Studies have shown
that increasing the injection distance by 1 cm away from the NMJs reduces the efficacy of BoNT by 46%. An
NMJ-targeted precision BoNT injection technique will retain therapeutic effects, reduce adverse effects and cost.
Unfortunately, an NMJ-targeted precision BoNT injection technique is not yet available. To address this gap in
CPP management, we have 1) successfully developed a novel vaginal high-density surface electromyography
(HD-sEMG) technique to reliably and quantitatively assess PFOA and accurately map the NMJ distributions of
overactive pelvic floor muscles (PFMs), and 2) successfully demonstrated a significant improvement (66%) in
BoNT injection treatment outcomes with vs. without HD-sEMG guidance. Inspired by the promising research
results, the HillMed and the University of Houston PIs co-invented a novel technique for personalized BoNT
injections, guided using vaginal HD-sEMG, for managing CPP and PFOA.
This FastTrack SBIR project aims to develop a commercializable, personalized, precision BoNT injection medical
device, i.e., the PelviMap, utilizing a vaginal HD-sEMG technology, to optimize the treatment outcomes in CPP
management. In Phase I, we will develop the vaginal HD-sEMG probe to further improve its diagnostic
performance, and develop PFOA severity assessment and NMJ mapping algorithms into a clinician-friendly
automated software package, which will be fully integrated into the proposed PelviMap system. In Phase II, we
will assess the efficacy of the developed personalized, precision BoNT injection medical device (PelviMap) in a
clinical trial study with 46 women with IC/BPS, and 15 healthy controls in collaboration with Baylor College of
Medicine. The deliverable of this proposal is to, for the first time, develop a marketed NMJ-targeted precision
BoNT injection system to optimize the BoNT treatment efficiency in CPP management. Successful
commercialization can help up to 26 million women who suffer from CPP and require more effective therapy."
11077971,"According to the 2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 14.1 million adults ages 18 and older had
Alcohol Use Disorder, and approximately 825,000 people indicated heavy alcohol use. However, only about
8% of individuals who had AUD in 2018 received treatment. In part, the lack of treatment results from the
paucity of effective therapeutics available to treat AUD, and research is ongoing to develop new therapeutic
approaches. Lohocla Research Corporation has been developing such a therapeutic, called Nezavist, which
was shown in nonclinical models to reduce alcohol relapse in dependent individuals. The goal of Lohocla is to
produce a treatment for individuals, including those with AUD, who wish to reduce their alcohol consumption.
Nezavist acts as a positive allosteric modulator of GABA-A receptors, acting at a novel site on the receptor
distinct from other modulators such as benzodiazepines. The other novel characteristic of Nezavist is its site of
action within the intestine, where Nezavist modulates the activity of the enteric nervous system and produces
its effect on alcohol consumption through a gut-brain communication pathway. By this means, Nezavist can
influence brain activity without itself entering the brain. This application is for a Phase IIB renewal of SBIR
U44AA024905, which will support the completion and submission of an IND application to the FDA and the
performance of Phase1 safety and tolerability clinical trials of Nezavist. During the course of the current SBIR
grant, Lohocla developed a method to scale up the synthesis of Nezavist, using flow chemistry to circumvent
hazardous steps, and obtained kilogram quantities of cGMP Nezavist. A spray-dried dispersion formulation has
been produced that enhances bioavailability. In vitro ADME studies were performed, including determining
pathways of metabolism, and investigating metabolic processes in tissues from several species, which
assisted in the choice of species for in vivo toxicology and pharmacokinetics. In vitro interactions with
transporters and CYP450 enzymes were also completed. The spray-dried dispersion formulation was used to
assess pharmacokinetics and toxicology in several species, and the results of the toxicology studies provide
the data needed to determine the dosing levels for the first-in-human studies. A pre-IND meeting was
accomplished with a favorable outcome. Overall, Lohocla has completed most of the IND-enabling studies
needed to progress to clinical trials, including the development of methods for administering the drug to
humans. The proposed Phase IIB renewal includes completion of the mass balance study recommended by
the FDA to be included in the IND application, and synthesis of cGMP formulation that can be used in the
clinical trials. Once the IND is approved, Phase 1a and Phase 1b clinical trials are proposed. Concurrent with
the clinical trials, a long-term nonclinical toxicology study in rat will be performed that will be needed to provide
a NOAEL in order to proceed to human laboratory studies and Phase 2 clinical trials. A commercialization plan
provides information on the market potential for Nezavist. The successful completion of the Phase IIB work will
provide the basis for efficacy studies of a novel therapeutic approach to reduce excessive and harmful alcohol
consumption."

The hair cycle is an excellent model to study adult stem cell (SC) regulation by the microenvironment or niche,
as it involves bouts of hair follicle (HF) regression, rest and regrowth. During regression, most HF epithelial cells
die by apoptosis while the mesenchymal dermal papilla (DP) cell cluster survives and relocates from the HF
base to the SCs in the permanent upper follicle. During the resting phase, signals from the DP are critical for
activating the SCs to initiate regeneration of a growing HF. In contact with the DP and encasing growing HFs is
the dermal sheath (DS), which we recently reported is a specialized smooth muscle essential for DP relocation
and follicle regression. Within the DS, a non-smooth muscle cell subpopulation was recently discovered that also
survives regression and has the intriguing SC potential for regenerating the DS smooth muscle of re-growing
HFs and for contributing cells to the DP lineage during hair cycling. The cells were aptly named HF dermal SCs
(hfDSCs). However, the evidence for these potent cells has been largely indirect due to the lack of direct genetic
targeting for hfDSC cell ablation, labeling and tracing and for gene knockouts. Our immediate goal is to overcome
this roadblock for enabling direct functional hfDSC studies and answering several key questions: What is the
functional requirement of hfDSCs for HF regrowth? What is their lineage contribution to the DP during normal
unperturbed hair cycling? What is the hfDSC cell plasticity during wound healing? What are the molecular
mechanisms that control hfDSC identity and potency? Our long-term goal is to understand how hfDSCs and DP
niche cells govern SC functions and to provide a rational basis for developing future hair regenerative therapies.
We have recently isolated, transcriptome-wide characterized, genetically targeted and live imaged the mature
DS to uncover a key contractile role in follicle regression. We have now developed a genetic driver to study the
cellular and molecular functions of their progenitors, the hfDSCs. With our preliminary data we have established
the conditions to specifically and inducibly target for the first time the hfDSCs; explore their cellular dynamics;
define the functional requirement of hfDSC; purify for the first time hfDSCs in their quiescent and activated states;
define hfDSC-specific gene signatures; and interrogate the regulation of hfDSC identity and function. With these
studies we will rigorously test the hypothesis that hfDSCs constitute a potent mesenchymal progenitor population
of the HF niche. Overall, this work will establish genetic targeting of resting-phase hfDSCs, reveal their cellular
turnover and lineage potential for other hair and skin mesenchymal cells and provide molecular insight into
hfDSC gene regulation and function during the cycle."
10849646,"Breast mammography is one of the most successful cancer screening tools in the cancer prevention arsenal. 37 million women in the US will receive a mammogram this year, and following that, these women will receive a letter letting them know whether they do or do not have evidence of breast cancer. Recent research indicates that standard digital mammography also yields additional information critical to womenâs health; that is, information about the presence of calcifications within breast arteries - breast arterial calcification (BAC). The presence of BAC has been associated with calcification within coronary arteries, which is a marker of coronary artery disease (CAD). Research indicates that at least 12.7% of womenâs mammograms reveal BAC â about 1 in 8. Of those with BAC, 32%-96% have CAD. Thus, conservatively, mammography could detect over 1.5 million cases of CAD each year. Despite this potential public health boon, BAC information is not directly communicated to patients in the post-mammography letter. The failure to communicate BAC status is a missed opportunity to inform women about CAD risk, and is inconsistent with patient preferences. The goal of this proposal is to investigate whether provision of BAC information to women post-mammography influences their cardiovascular health behaviors. We will randomize mammography patients whose imaging reveals BAC (N=1,889, English and Spanish-speaking) to either: a) the BAC-Enhanced letter condition which informs women about their positive BAC findings and the BAC-CAD association, encourages women to seek preventive cardiology care, and provides cardiology referral information; or b) the Waitlist Control condition, where patients receive a standard mammography letter initially and learn their BAC status 6 months later. We hypothesize that women who receive the BAC-Enhanced letter will be more likely to attend a cardiovascular health appointment (primary outcome), engage in heart healthy behavior, and have CAD detected. Guided by the Common Sense Model, we seek to understand which psychological factors mediate the relationship between the intervention and the outcomes. Also, most BAC prevalence literature has been conducted on predominantly white samples. To remedy this, we will describe BAC prevalence in a large, racially and ethnically diverse sample (N=14,875). Innovation: This will be the first study of an intervention to directly share BAC information with women undergoing mammography in a âdirect to consumerâ approach, and the first to report BAC prevalence in a racially and ethnically diverse sample. Public health impact: The project is a first step towards ensuring that women benefit directly from all of the rich health data that mammography can yield."
10806920,"Project Summary
HIV-1 infection is typically well controlled with combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, viral
reservoirs persist in lymphoid tissues leading to rapid rebound viremia following ART discontinuation. The
mechanisms that underlie viral persistence include latency, proliferation or clonal outgrowth of cells harboring
intact viral genomes, and immune responses that are inadequate to access or kill infected cells. After almost a
decade of intensive research to cure HIV infection, there has been little success in eliminating or even reducing
HIV-1 reservoirs, indicating that barriers to achieving this goal are formidable. It has become clear that basic
questions and mechanisms of how viral persistence is maintained need to be addressed in relevant animal
models that can reveal vulnerabilities in these reservoirs and inform hypothesis-driven interventions to impact
their size and durability. The Hoxie lab has described a unique nonhuman primate model in which a 2 amino
acid deletion in the SIVmac239 envelope cytoplasmic tail, disrupting a highly conserved cellular trafficking
signal, produces a virus termed âGY that is highly replication fit during acute infection but is rapidly controlled
to undetectable levels in plasma by cellular immune responses in the absence of neutralizing antibodies. Viral
reservoirs are clearly present years after infection, as demonstrated by anti-CD8 cell depletion studies, and
have been detected and quantified by state of the art assays in PBMCs and lymphoid tissue. This proposal will
use the âGY model of elite cellular control to test the hypothesis that an intervention with a potent and long-
lasting neutralizing antibody, with or without the latency reversing-like activity of CD8 cell depletion, thus
exerting both cellular and humoral immune attack on the viral reservoir, will accelerate the decay of and/or
eliminate replication competent viruses. Four Specific Aims are proposed: 1) to define and quantify viral
reservoirs during elite immunologic control of âGY, characterizing relevant cell types, transcriptional activity,
integration sites, and mechanisms that underlie persistence; 2) determine if long term expression of eCD4-Ig, a
novel engineered antibody-like molecule with potent neutralizing and non-neutralizing functions against
SIVmac239 and âGY, with or without CD8 cell depletion to activate virus production, can synergize with host
cellular immune responses to reduce reservoirs; 3) extend findings from Aims 1 and 2 to SIVmac239 infection
in which viral control prior to eCD4-Ig and CD8 cell depletion is exerted through ART rather than cellular
immune control; and 4) create novel SHIV and HIV-1 isolates that contain mutations analogous to the âGY
mutation for future studies to explore interventions that can build on the findings of this proposal to reduce or
eliminate persisting HIV-1 reservoirs. If viral reservoirs in the âGY model can be reduced or eliminated, this
study will provide a proof of concept that this goal is feasible, and inform immunological interventions during
ART-suppression animal models and in humans."
10851670,"Over 200,000 children have a 911 Emergency Medical Services (EMS) activation for respiratory distress each
year, most of whom have acute wheezing. Early treatment in the prehospital setting could more rapidly relieve
respiratory distress symptoms, prevent hypoxia, reduce invasive interventions, and reduce the need to be
hospitalized, thereby facilitating earlier return to normal daily activities. Preliminary data from one site found
hospital admission was reduced from 30% to 21% among children when an EMS system introduced a pediatric
asthma protocol with oral dexamethasone. The current standard for Emergency Department (ED) treatment for
acute wheezing for children two and older includes inhaled ipratropium and dexamethasone. These treatments
have a longstanding history of safety and are effective in preventing hospitalization when used early in the ED.
Specific treatment protocols generally direct prehospital care. Ipratropium and dexamethasone are
recommended by national EMS organizations that develop model protocols for prehospital care. However, only
25% of EMS agencies from large US metropolitan areas allow ipratropium, and only 10% include
dexamethasone in their treatment protocols. A clinical trial is critically needed to evaluate whether the
significant EMS resources required to implement interventions for wheezing children that have proven benefit
in the ED result in improved patient outcomes. The overall objective of this three-site pilot trial is to address
specific questions related to the implementation of the study and ensure its feasibility. The study will be
conducted in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) EMS Affiliates (EMSAs).
We will include patients aged 2-18 who have a 911 call for acute wheezing. The specific aims are 1) to develop
and produce a prehospital checklist for the treatment bundle including ipratropium and dexamethasone, 2) to
determine the feasibility of collecting patient outcomes for wheezing children treated in the EMS system, and 3)
to evaluate implementation of the EMS treatment bundle and checklist using the RE-AIM framework. This
study will provide the necessary data to ensure the eventual trial is feasible, primarily by establishing the ability
to measure the outcomes of interest as well as evaluating implementation. This study is innovative by focusing
on pediatric care in the prehospital environment, a critical component of our emergency care system that is
often neglected in research."
10744753,"Patient cost burden (PCB) for healthcare, as influenced by the rapidly changing health policy landscape, is a
common patient-reported outcome for uninsured individuals and enrollees in high deductible health plans
(HDHPs, 30% of employer-sponsored plans). In these contexts, PCB has important effects on adherence to
medications that help manage cardiovascular and metabolic health (CMH). The management of CMH, including
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is an important part of healthy aging, and affects risk of Alzheimer's disease
and related dementias (ADRD). In order to understand the long-term consequences of today's PCB on the
healthy aging and ADRD risk of tomorrow, it is critical to develop methods and models that can simulate the
complicated interplay between PCB, medication adherence, and ADRD. The proposed work in this application
builds upon my experience investigating effects of insurance design and pharmacoepidemiology of ADRD, and
enhances it by adding training in areas that are critical to achieving my long-term career goal: to become a
leading independent investigator of the relationships between health policies and the burden of chronic diseases.
The training of this award includes development and application of simulation models of healthcare interventions,
policy and stakeholder engagement, T2DM and ADRD, geriatric research and care, and leadership. The newly
acquired skills and knowledge obtained are necessary to conduct the proposed research, which aims to examine
the effects of PCB on management of T2DM, and simulating how health policies that influence PCB affect the
burden of ADRD. With mentorship from established leaders in simulation modeling, geriatrics, health economics,
health policy, ADRD, and T2DM, I will accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Simulate long-term effects of
PCB on T2DM management and progression using the Real-World Progression in Diabetes Model (RAPIDS).
PCB will be examined in the context of uninsurance and HDHPs, and we will simulate how effects of PCB on
T2DM management translate into long-term CMH outcomes in RAPIDS, a validated model of T2DM progression.
2) Build a new simulation model using a near-elderly/elderly lifetime perspective to connect PCB, T2DM
progression, and ADRD incidence and burden. The new Healthcare Access Today and Healthy Aging Tomorrow
(HATHAT) Model will connect the RAPIDS Model to the validated Future Elderly Model (FEM), in order to
comprehensively relate PCB, T2DM treatments, micro- and macro- vascular events, and biomarkers to the future
burden of ADRD. 3) Evaluate long-term consequences of highly relevant state and national policies on healthy
aging in the HATHAT Model. Policy experts will advise on the most relevant and impactful policies to evaluate,
and simulations will delineate effects along the PCB-->Treatment Use-->CMH-->ADRD nexus. Success of this
project can lead to future models that examine health policies yet to be conceived, in a range of disease areas.
This will leave me well-positioned to lead an independent research program that influences future policy by
identifying how PCB and access to care relate to long-term healthy aging and ADRD."

10598010,"Our previous work has collected normative data for measures of both tinnitus perception and tinnitus functional
effects (reactions). Participants with chronic tinnitus, who were not receiving tinnitus-specific intervention,
completed tinnitus psychoacoustic measures and tinnitus questionnaires at 0, 1, 3, and 6 months. Participants
were included in each of six age ranges (18-30; 31-40; 41-50; 51-60; 61-70; 70+). These data will contribute to
age-specific reference values for the different measures once all data analyses are complete (final participant
testing occurred on October 30, 2018). The proposed study will extend and expand this effort by: (1) building
on the normative standards database by testing a cohort of new participants; (2) assessing long-term
repeatability of tinnitus psychoacoustic measures by obtaining additional longitudinal data from participants
recalled from the previous study; (3) developing methodology to evaluate individual pitch-perception ability and
providing training as needed; (4) evaluating the effect of pitch training on ability to match tinnitus pitch with
greater precision; and (5) continuing development of the tablet-based tinnitus evaluation system (TES) for
clinical utility by improving the interface and other performance features, and by creating a rapid assessment
program to obtain reliable loudness matches and pitch matches in under 10 minutes. To accomplish these
objectives, new participants will be enrolled into two separate cohorts of 150 and 100 individuals (total new
enrollment n=250). Both cohorts of new participants will meet the same inclusion criteria as used in the
previous study. The 150 new participants will undergo repeated testing at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months to
replicate testing as done during the previous study. The separate cohort of 100 new participants will be
enrolled to evaluate a training program for pitch matching. Of these, half will complete a program of pitch-
perception testing and training that will be administered prior to the start of baseline testing (comparison of
pitch matching data between groups with vs. without training will determine if the program improves within-
session reliability of the pitch matching test). Finally, a third cohort of 100 of the previous study's participants
will return to repeat testing ~3 years following their baseline testing to obtain long-term reliability data. In
addition to data collection, efforts will be ongoing to complete development and validation of the tablet-based
TES with the intent to ready this system for clinical application. A test protocol requiring 5-10 minutes is
needed for the TES to have the potential to achieve more widespread use among VA audiologists. A rapid TES
protocol will be developed, tested, and validated with a subset of participants to achieve this objective.
Completing the work described in this application will accomplish many objectives, including making tinnitus
psychoacoustic measures more useful and practical for clinical and research utilization."
10783811,"The prognosis of HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) treated with standard radiation at 70 Gy is excellent.
However, 80% of these patients experience grade â¥2 mucositis and 30% have permanent swallowing
dysfunction. Clinical data suggest that 70 Gy may be overtreatment for some HPV+ OPCs. A modest
reduction of 10-16 Gy for an unselected cohort with HPV+ OPC showed a 2-year progression-free survival
(PFS) of 80%, but 40% of patients still had difficulty swallowing at 1 year. The proposed research will employ
imaging (PET/MRI) biomarkers to identify patients with HPV+ OPC who may benefit from a major dose
reduction to 30 Gy, a dose based on experience in HPV+ anal cancer, with the goal of maintaining tumor
control and cure while substantially reducing treatment-related toxicity. A pilot trial of 19 HPV+ OPC patients
treated at 30 Gy followed by neck dissection was encouraging, with a 2-year PFS of 93%. Significant toxicity
reduction was observed. The proposed research will expand on the initial findings of the proof- of-principle
study to a larger cohort of patients. The proposed imaging metrics to select patients for major dose de-
escalation will include baseline and early intra-treatment [18F]-FMISO PET imaging, which will provide
information on tumor hypoxia, a marker of radioresistance (Aim 1). Eligible patients will have no evidence of
hypoxia on baseline imaging or have resolution of hypoxia during treatment, which will portend tumor
radiosensitivity. We will interrogate the tumor microenvironment (Aim 2) by deriving quantitative imaging
biomarkers (QIBs) from multi-parametric diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) consisting of non-Gaussian
intravoxel incoherent motion (NG-IVIM) as well as [18F]-FMISO) PET imaging to select appropriate 30 Gy
candidates to avoid neck dissection, with the goal of further toxicity reduction. The change in intra-
treatment diffusion (D, surrogate of tumor cellularity) and kurtosis (K, surrogate of tissue microstructure) from
baseline DW-MRI will guide which patients de-escalated to 30 Gy can avoid neck dissection. HPV is known to
dysregulate the DNA damage response (DDR) and double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways to facilitate
viral replication. Preclinical work suggests that this dysregulation accounts for the radiosensitivity of HPV+
OPC, although there are conflicting data regarding the precise nature of the responsible defect. For Aim 3,
whole-genome sequencing (WGS) with mutational signature analyses will be used to identify DDR and
DSB repair defects in individual HPV tumors and characterize the clinical influence on radiosensitivity. The
relationship between genomic signatures and non-invasive imaging of tumor hypoxia and tumor cellularity that
portend radiobiological sensitivity also will be explored. The proposal's central hypothesis is that PET/MRI of
HPV+ OPC classification with the underpinnings of a molecular characterization of the cancer biology will
yield a robust decision tool to stratify patients for whom dose de-escalation to 30 Gy will provide a
clinical benefit and significantly reduced toxicity, without compromising treatment outcome."
10892636,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Community violence is a major public health concern in the U.S. that disproportionately affects communities with
predominately low-income and African American residents. Previous research has linked violent crime (i.e.,
murder, rape, aggravated assault, and armed robbery) at the community level to a variety of adverse health
behaviors and health outcomes including substance abuse, mental illness, and physical inactivity. To date, very
little research has been conducted on the nutritional consequences of community violence at the community or
individual levels. As a result, there is limited understanding of how community violence affects the retail food
environment and the diet-related behaviors of individuals and families. This K01 project seeks to fill this void in
knowledge by examining community violence and its influence on food retail, food purchasing behavior, and
dietary intake in low-income African American communities located in Chicago, IL. A mixed-methods research
approach will be utilized to accomplish the following three research aims: 1) assess perceptions of how
community violence has affected the business of local food retailers by conducting a series of semi-structured
in-depth interviews with owners & managers of food retail businesses located in low-income African American
communities in Chicago with a high violent crime rate, 2) evaluate longitudinal associations between community-
level racial and socioeconomic characteristics, violent crime rates, and the availability and density of food
retailers by analyzing 10 years of data collected by the City of Chicago (2008-2018), and 3) examine associations
between exposure to community violence, food purchasing behavior, and dietary intake by surveying low-income
African American adults who reside in a predominately low-income African American community in Chicago with
a high violent crime rate. This research will greatly increase our understanding of how violence affects community
nutrition. Furthermore, it will provide valuable information to researchers, policymakers, and public health
agencies on the role of community violence in creating nutrition-related health inequities at the community and
individual levels. Findings from this K01 project will inform a future R01 proposal that will further explore
relationships between community violence, food retail, food purchasing behavior, and dietary intake."
10899778,"Project Summary
Senescent cells (SnCs) are known to play a causal role in aging and numerous age-related diseases. However,
they also contribute to wound healing and tissue remodeling. Both physiological and pathological roles are linked
to the secretome of SnCs and their complex interaction with the immune system, which is thought to play an
important role in clearing SnCs. Most of what we have learned about SnCs is derived from mice where it has
been clearly demonstrated that genetic or pharmacologic removal of SnCs in aged or diseased organisms
reduces frailty; improves strength, endurance, and resilience; and attenuates a variety of age-related diseases
including Alzheimerâs. This novel approach of therapeutically targeting a fundamental aging process common to
many diseases â rather than drugging disease-specific perturbations (e.g., low insulin or hypertension) â could
have a tremendous impact on our aging population. However, much needs to be learned about SnCs in humans
to deploy such approaches safely and effectively. This project aims to establish a Tissue Mapping Center at the
University of Minnesota (MN TMC) to contribute to the SenNet Consortium, which intends to build a 4D atlas of
SnCs in multiple human organs with healthy aging. MN TMC proposes to focus on adipose (omental and
subcutaneous), skeletal muscle (Vastus lateralis), liver, and ovarian tissue. This selection is based on MN TMCâs
expertise in the biology, cell biology, and immunology of these organs; in studying SnCs in these organs; and
experience with single cell technologies in these organs. The MN TMC and its Administrative Core will be led by
PIs with complementary expertise in SnCs and computational biology/health informatics. The Biospecimen Core
will be led by the UMN Chairman of Surgery and an accomplished pathologist. The Biological Analysis Core will
be led by an expert in SnC and a molecular pathologist leading spatial genomics at UMN. The Data Analysis
Core will be led by three bioinformaticians with expertise in modeling, single cell, and spatial-omics analysis, and
blending patient electronic health records with -omics data. A unique feature of the proposed MN TMC is that
the entire workflow will be housed within existing infrastructure/cores: from CTSI and BioNet, which manage
human subjects research, tissue procurement, annotation, and distribution/storage, to the genomic/
proteomics/imaging cores, along with the Institute of Health Informatics for data management and multiplexing.
Key personnel include leadership of all of these UMN components. This approach provides unequaled stability
of our analytical pipeline and in-place quality control and assurance mechanisms. A second unique feature of
the proposed MN TMC is our ability to perform spatial transcriptomics and proteomics on formalin-fixed paraffin
embedded biospecimens, which enables analysis of the most stable biospecimens and virtually any archived
material. Overall, the goal of the MN TMC is to make a significant contribution to the 4D atlas of human SnCs,
working closely with NIH and other TMCs to develop and adhere to standards created by the SenNet Consortium."
10828783,"Candida albicans and related Candida spp. are responsible for ~400,000 invasive infections/year, which have
an ~50% mortality rate. A crucial virulence trait of C. albicans, and other fungi, is the ability to diminish their
detection by their hosts. The cell wall carbohydrate Ã(1,3)-glucan is an important epitope that the immune
systems of humans and other mammals use to recognize and respond to fungal infections through receptors
like Dectin-1 and complement receptor 3 (CR3). Fungi like C. albicans diminish their detection from immune
cells through masking Ã(1,3)-glucan under an outer layer of mannosylated glycoproteins (mannan). The
virulence of C. albicans is compromised in conditions where Ã(1,3)-glucan is more exposed (unmasked). For
example, echinocandin antifungal drugs, like caspofungin, inhibit Ã(1,3)-glucan synthase and cause cell lysis in
vitro, but also induce exposure of Ã(1,3)-glucan, even at sublethal concentrations. In addition, a number of
mutants that exhibit increased exposure of Ã(1,3)-glucan have decreased virulence. However, a major
research challenge is to understand the impact of Ã(1,3)-glucan exposure on virulence during caspofungin
treatment. It has been difficult to differentiate between cidal effects of the drug and the impact of Ã(1,3)-glucan
exposure. A challenge closely related to this is that the mechanism by which caspofungin causes Ã(1,3)-glucan
exposure is unknown. We have found that we can decouple caspofungin's cidal effects from unmasking,
which allows us to address both of these challenges. This can be done by activating caspofungin-responsive
signaling pathways using a genetic approach rather than the drug, and we have discovered that at least one of
these pathways causes unmasking. The Cek1 MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway is activated by caspofungin
treatment, and we have discovered that genetic activation of this cascade causes unmasking when
hyperactivated, even in the absence of caspofungin. However, unlike the drug, activation of this pathway does
not compromise viability. Thus, we can meet the second challenge by using this pathway to dissect the
mechanism through which unmasking occurs. Moreover, we can meet the first challenge by using the Cek1
pathway as tool to probe how the immune system responds to unmasking during mouse systemic infections
because, unlike caspofungin, it is not cidal. We will address these challenges in three specific aims. In Aim 1
we will elucidate the mechanisms by which the Cek1 cascade regulates Ã(1,3)-glucan exposure. There are two
main transcription factors downstream of Cek1 and we will determine how the pathway chooses a particular
one (Cph1) using a combination of genetic, epistasis, and cell biology techniques that will identify how Cek1-
Cph1 is activated to cause unmasking. In Aim 2 we will determine how transcriptional targets of Cek1-Cph1
alter the cell wall to cause unmasking. In Aim 3, we will elucidate how exposure of Ã(1,3)-glucan causes
decreased virulence in mice. We will use transgenic mice to define how neutrophils, macrophages, Dectin-1
and/or CR3 participate to reduce the virulence of unmasked C. albicans."

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, debilitating inflammatory disease that affects 1.3 million older adults in
the US. The number of older adults living with RA is growing and one-third are diagnosed with late-onset RA
(LORA), characterized by more severe disease, greater comorbidity burden at time of diagnosis, and disability.
Older adults with RA are less likely to receive effective disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and
more likely to receive long-term glucocorticoids alone for treatment which suggest we may be accepting less
than optimal management in this population and better outcomes may be achievable. Dr. Jiha Lee is an
Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan whose long-term goal is to become an independent
investigator and national leader in geriatric rheumatology focused on advancing the science of effective
medication use to improve the care of older adults with rheumatic diseases. This K23 Mentored Patient-
Oriented Research Career Development Award application (PA-20-205) will support Dr. Lee to gain additional
training and mentoring, and by completing the proposed work to become one of the few clinician-scientists with
unique qualifications at the intersection of rheumatology, aging, pharmacoepidemiology, and mixed methods
research to conduct rigorous aging research in the field of rheumatology. The overarching scientific goal of this
mentored-research proposal is to investigate suboptimal DMARD use and tolerability to different treatment
regimens in usual care among older adults with LORA and to engage patients and providers to better
understand observed outcomes. The proposed explanatory sequential mixed methods study will use nationally
representative Medicare claims data for Aims 1 and 2, followed by in-depth semi-structured interviews with
patients and providers for Aim 3. Specifically, in Aim 1, Dr. Lee will examine patient and provider/healthcare
factors associated with suboptimal DMARD use in older adults with LORA during the first 12 months after
index date of diagnosis, gathering critical information to identify targets for future efforts to improve DMARD
use. To build toward more evidence-based prescribing, in Aim 2 she will examine outcomes associated with
different treatment regimens and identify patients at greatest risk of poor outcomes. In Aim 3, she will use the
results from Aims 1 and 2 to guide the sampling strategy and discussion guide development to engage patients
with LORA and providers to examine and inform additional potentially important factors that drive treatment
approaches. Dr. Lee will conduct all work at the rich environment of the University of Michigan, with guidance
from her exceptional team of mentors and advisors led by Dr. Julie Bynum. The proposed work will lay the
foundation to identify subpopulations at risk of poor outcomes and build the evidence base for an R01-level
application to inform development and evaluation of age-appropriate approaches to treatment of LORA."

Defining the molecular and cellular heterogeneity underlying senescent cell states is a critical knowledge gap in
the field. The Columbia University Senescence Tissue Mapping (CUSTMAP) Center is uniquely poised to
address this gap by creating a multi-scale atlas of senescence in diverse tissue types across the adult human
lifespan. CUSTMAP is a highly collaborative effort that builds upon long-standing and established collaborations
between Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC), The University of Edinburgh, New York University
(NYU), and the New York Genome Center (NYGC). Using state-of-the-art spatial genomics technologies and
leveraging our established experimental workflows and analytical pipelines, CUSTMAP will generate three-
dimensional maps of senescent cells in tissues with vulnerability to age-related degenerative processes: the
central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the skin. We will perform spatially resolved transcriptomics
(ST), single-nucleus RNA-sequencing, and multiplexed proteomics using iterative indirect immunofluorescence
imaging (4i) experiments in central nervous system (CNS) and skin tissues across the human lifespan, allowing
for unprecedented genome-wide molecular characterization at single-cell resolution in space. CUSTMAP is
structured around three scientific Cores, as well as an Administrative Core to support these integrated efforts.
Human tissue samples characterized and collected through the Biospecimen Core (BIO) will be analyzed using
the tools and techniques developed through the Biological Analysis Core (BAC) and Data Analysis Core (DAC),
leading to detailed maps of senescent cells and their effects in human tissues at single-cell resolution. The
success of CUSTMAP is predicated on access to a continuous supply of human tissues from healthy individuals
across the lifespan. CUSTMAP investigators have access to post-mortem samples and prospective tissue
collection from local resources at CUIMC as well as through established collaborations. Our unique geographic
location in Upper Manhattan enables tissue acquisition from a local population of patients that is rich in racial
and ethnic diversity. Thus, CUSTMAP is uniquely poised to obtain high-quality tissue from these diverse
populations and apply cutting-edge multiomic approaches to build integrated 3D molecular atlases of senescent
cells in CNS and skin tissues. Our approach provides a unique platform for driving transformative discoveries
of novel molecular, cellular and regional correlates of age-related changes in cellular senescence in human
tissues. The CUSTMAP workflow and computational tools are readily generalizable to other tissue types and
can be efficiently shared with and deployed across the SenNet Consortium."
10615062,"ABSTRACT
Pancreatic cancer (PC) is lethal with a five-year survival rate of less than 9.2 % and a median survival of 5-6
months. The limited efficacy of mono-therapies has led to the exploration of combination therapies with limited
success because of challenges associated with dose-limiting side effects, drug-associated toxicities, drug
resistance, and poor pharmacokinetics. Importantly, these past approaches have not attempted the concurrent
targeting of the pancreatic tumor and its stroma and PC stem cells. Our proposed work addresses these
challenges by determining functional and clinic-pathological significance of miR-345 as well as developing a dual
delivery nanoscale device (DDND) for combined delivery of miR-345 and GEM for the treatment of PC. Our
preliminary studies have shown that miR-345 targets several important genes, including sonic hedgehog (Shh),
Kras, MUC4 mucin and its downstream targets, genes-associated with cancer stem cells (ALDH1, ESA, Hif1Î±,
and Oct/3/4), and causes up regulation of cleaved caspase-3, -7, and PARP. The Kras, Shh and MUC4-signaling
play critical roles in tumor growth and metastasis by promoting epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), PC
stem cells, angiogenesis, desmoplasia, which limit the delivery and efficacy of chemotherapy. MiR-345 targeting
Kras, Shh and MUC4, which makes miR-345 is an excellent candidate for diagnostic/prognostic and therapeutic
targets in PC. We hypothesize that downregulation of miR-345 contributes to PC pathogenesis by upregulation
of Kras, SHH, and MUC4; Its restoration, combination with GEM through the DDND, enhances GEM sensitivity
in PC through modulation of SHH/Kras/MUC4 pathways, resulting in inhibition of desmoplasia, pancreatic stellate
cells, and PC stem cells leading to an improved therapeutic outcome of GEM in PC through improving its tumor
perfusion. The DDND is based on temperature and pH responsive pentablock copolymers electrostatically
complexed with miR-345 and subsequently self-assembled with GEM encapsulated layers. The DDND design
allows effective co-incorporation of miRNA/GEM combination; facilitates cellular entry; enhances stability
compared to liposomal carriers; provides miRNA protection; allows targeting by selectively facilitating endosomal
escape in cancer cells as opposed to normal cells by exploiting intracellular pH differences; and allows dose-
sparing of the cytotoxic drugs. Aim 1 will focus to determine functional role and clinico-pathological significance
of miR-345/Shh/Kras/MUC4 axis in highly aggressive and metastatic PC. Aim 2 will focus on the development
of DDND loaded miR-345/GEM as a novel therapeutic agent against lethal PC by evaluating their therapeutic
efficacy in vitro. In the final Aim 3, we will evaluate therapeutic efficacy of DDND loaded miR-345/GEM alone or
in combination in mouse models. Altogether, the proposed work decipher the clinic-pathological significance of
miR-345 and expected to significantly advance the goal of combining GEM and miR-345 delivery for treatment
of PC patients, enhance understanding of the synergistic mechanisms involved, and will provide a novel DDND
design for delivery of other therapeutics as well in the future."
10808980,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine has proven to be a daunting scientific challenge. Despite decades
of research, there are no examples of immunogens that consistently elicit potent broadly neutralizing antibodies
(bNAbs). Our scientific premise is that there are three principal obstacles to inducing bNAbs in primates and
humans that prior vaccine approaches have largely failed to overcome. These are: i) efficient and consistent
priming of multiple HIV-1 bNAb precursor B cells; ii) immunofocused boosting of B cell responses targeting
conserved bNAb epitopes and away from off-target epitopes; and iii) affinity-guided maturation of B cell lineages
to select for enhanced neutralization breadth and potency. Here, we address each of these requirements. This
application is a competitive renewal of an existing HIVRAD award where we hypothesized that a major roadblock
to rational HIV-1 vaccine design is the lack of a suitable primate model in which bNAbs can be commonly induced
and the molecular, biological and immunological mechanisms responsible for such responses studied in a
reproducible and iterative fashion. Overcoming this roadblock was one of the major goals of that grant, and over
the past five years we have made substantial progress in reaching this milestone. We did this by developing a
novel design strategy for creating simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIV) that bear clinically-relevant
primary HIV-1 Envs and that replicate efficiently in rhesus macaques (RMs). We next hypothesized that SHIV-
infected RMs could be used to identify HIV-1 Envs that have a propensity for eliciting bNAbs of predetermined
epitope specificity, thus allowing for a detailed and reproducible molecular characterization of the coevolutionary
pathways of Env and Ab that lead to affinity maturation and breadth. Again, we obtained strong supporting
evidence (Science 371:eabd2638, 2021). Here we propose to build on this foundation and to test the hypothesis
that elucidation of the molecular pathways of Env-Ab coevolution leading to neutralization breadth in SHIV-
infected RMs, combined with biophysical and immunological analyses of key Env-Ab lineage intermediates, can
provide a molecular âblueprintâ for successful germline-targeted, B cell lineage-based immunogen design. To
test this hypothesis, we propose three highly inter-related research projects and three cores: Project 1 - Env-Ab
coevolution in SHIV infected RMs leading to V3 glycan bNAbs (Shaw); Project 2 - Optimizing humoral immunity
to HIV-1 Env proteins (Kelsoe); Project 3 - Immunogen design to elicit polyclonal bNAb responses to the V3
glycan supersite (Wiehe). These projects will be enabled by Core A â Administrative (Shaw); Core B â Viral and
antibody gene sequencing (Hahn); and Core C â Bioinformatics and statistics (Wagh). The significance of the
proposed studies is potentially far-reaching: previous studies of HIV-1 SOSIP Env trimer vaccinations have
generally elicited only autologous strain-specific Nab responses in outbred animals. If we can demonstrate
consistent induction of bNAbs using germline-targeted, lineage-based SOSIP Env trimers as immunogens in
RMs, it would represent a major scientific advance and a new beachhead for HIV-1 vaccine research."
10802203,"Project Summary/Abstract: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one the leading causes of mortality and morbidity
affecting humanity, and a recognized risk factor for late-life neurodegenerative disorders. The absence of
validated biomarkers in the neurotrauma field is a barrier to drug development in this area, and as a
consequence there are currently no disease-modifying therapies that limit the burden of TBI. TBI is a complex
disease process, and there is a need to identify and measure subtypes of injury, in order to develop precision
medicine approaches where specific pathobiological processes are targeted by mechanistically appropriate
therapies. Traumatic axonal injury (TAI) is a common pathologic consequence of TBI, and underlies some of
the most disabling consequences of injury, including cognitive and affective problems. Recent breakthroughs in
pre-clinical models indicate that novel therapeutic interventions are effective in promoting resilience of injured
axons and improving neurologic outcome after experimental TBI. Translation of such promising therapies into
successful clinical trials will require prognostic biomarkers that can measure TAI in individual patients, so they
can be selected for early phase studies of axono-protective therapies, as well pharmacodynamic biomarkers
than can measure the biologic efficacy of such treatments. Currently, the best biomarker for TAI is fractional
anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of white matter tracts, measured using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
MRI. This technique, while robust, is poorly suited for dynamic longitudinal assessments, and measures the
end-result of axonal degeneration, rather than an early step in the neurodegenerative process. Recently, the
ability to assay axonal proteins in peripheral blood has made it potentially feasible to assess of TAI rapidly,
inexpensively, and longitudinally. The axonal protein that holds the most promise as a marker of axonal
degeneration is neurofilament light chain (NF-L). We hypothesize that NF-L is a prognostic biomarker of TAI.
Our project has 3 specific aims:
 Specific aim 1. We will determine reference intervals (RIs) for NF-L according to Clinical Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines, using commercially available assays (Quanterix, LLC, Lexington, MA).
 Specific aim 2. We will measure NF-L in existing serum samples from participants enrolled in a multi-center
observational study (TRACK-TBI) who also have MRIs at 2 weeks and 6 months after injury. The relationship
between NF-L elevations and neuroimaging measures of TAI (DTI measure of FA at the 2-week scan) and axonal
degeneration (white matter volume at 6 months after injury) will be assessed.
 Specific aim 3. We will extend the follow-up period of a subset of TRACK-TBI participants from 1 year to 5
years after injury, to assess the relationship between persistent NF-L elevations and neurodegeneration. The
existing clinical, imaging, and biomarker data in these subjects will be leveraged to identify risk factors, co-
morbidities, and prognostic biomarkers of long-term TBI-associated degeneration."
10929927,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Prescription drug misuse (PDM) â controlled medication use in ways not intended by the prescriber or use without
a prescription â is an important public health issue in adolescents and young adults (AYAs). Relative to other
age groups, older adolescents and young adults have the highest rates of PDM and high rates of PDM-related
overdose. Also, PDM initiation by age 18 is associated with poorer outcomes at 35 years. Research on AYA
PDM has established prevalence and processes in adolescents or young adults, but little research has
investigated age-period-cohort (APC) differences and longitudinal change in PDM among AYAs. Furthermore,
poly-PDM (i.e., PDM from multiple medication classes) and PDM-involved polysubstance use are
underinvestigated in AYAs, despite evidence that single medication class PDM without other substance use is
rare. Thus, the long-term goal of the research team is to understand PDM, poly-PDM, and PDM-involved
polysubstance use in AYAs to influence policy and facilitate the development of screening and intervention to
target AYAs most at-risk. Using data from the nationally representative longitudinal Monitoring the Future (MTF)
and cross-sectional National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) datasets, our aims in 12-30 year-old
AYAs are to: (1) establish age/period/cohort (APC) and longitudinal differences in PDM prevalence and
characteristics (i.e., SUD symptoms, motives, source, type, age of initiation, and co-ingestion); (2) quantify APC
and longitudinal patterns of poly-PDM, the PDM (e.g., motives) and policy features linked to longitudinal poly-
PDM change, and the effects of age of initiation on poly-PDM in AYAs; (3) evaluate longitudinal differences in
PDM-involved polysubstance use (e.g., opioids and heroin; psychostimulants), and factors (e.g., state-level
PDMP features) influencing course of PDM-involved polysubstance use; and (4) investigate the effects of life
course factors (i.e., marriage, education, social bonds, employment, and household) on the course of PDM, poly-
PDM and PDM-involved polysubstance use. Variable selection and analyses were guided by life course theories
of deviant behavior and substance use. The contribution of this project will be significant because of its focus on
identifying the most vulnerable AYAs in terms of PDM, poly-PDM and PDM-involved polysubstance use, all
ongoing and significant public health issues. The project is innovative because of the use of PDM-relevant policy
features (e.g., PDMP characteristics), use of life course theory and variables, and underutilized analyses (e.g.,
APC and mixture modeling). Finally, scientific rigor is maximized by the broad and complimentary expertise of
the research team, a history of publication with both datasets, use of validated measures, accepted analytic
techniques, and strong power for analyses. Rapid dissemination of the findings of this project can influence
policy and inform the development of maximally valid screening, prevention, and intervention for PDM and its
consequences in high-risk AYAs, all of which is consistent with the mission of NIDA."
10792575,"Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is the 5th most common cause of cancer-related death with an estimated
32,000 annual deaths in the United States. Current measures to combat the disease are insufficient and there
is an unmet need translating pre-clinical model findings to patients. Recently, though, a study modeled HCC in
mice using hydrodynamic tail vein injections with the Sleeping Beauty transposon system (referred hereafter as
the âtransposon systemâ). Here, tumors that develop are 69% genetically similar to patient HCCs driven by
mutant êµ-catenin and the tyrosine kinase receptor MET (B+M). I found that including IQGAP1, a scaffold
protein known to orchestrate and promote oncogenic signals, accelerates B+M HCC development and causes
enhanced tumor growth and severity. Importantly, I found increasing IQGAP1 expression promotes YAP1
signaling and drives the expression of NUAK2 kinase, a druggable YAP1 target gene recently linked to HCC
oncogenesis. These findings indicate that targeting the IQGAP1-YAP1 network in the liver could be a possible
direction for future therapies. I aim to better understand how IQGAP1 regulates the molecular mechanisms in
HCC, and my central hypothesis is that IQGAP1 drives HCC oncogenesis and its incorporation into a
humanized HCC system will improve HCC disease modeling. I will test this hypothesis in 2 specific aims:
Aim 1 will establish a humanized model of HCC and determine if IQGAP1 exacerbates disease pathology. Aim
2 will validate the utility of the humanized HCC model by targeting oncogenic Hippo signaling driven by
IQGAP1 overexpression.
 Overall, this proposal aims to explain IQGAP1âs mechanistic role in HCC biology. The IQGAP1-YAP1
relationship provides a novel direction for personalized medicine in HCC. In addition, elevated NUAK2
expression resulting from IQGAP1 mediated YAP1 activity is a mechanism novel to my work. Better
understanding this mechanism will provide greater insight to activated YAP1 in HCCs. In addition, my
proposed humanized HCC model is intended to accelerate pre-clinical findings and open the door to potential
personalized therapeutic approaches to benefit patients. I plan to pursue this work during my independent
career and the University of Pittsburgh provides a suitable environment for me to carry out my designed
studies. HCC is a significant public health concern and I am committed to a career studying the disease. With
full support from my collaborators, I am confident that I will be able to complete the proposed research. My
proposal builds on my current expertise and the protected time provided by the K22 mechanism will enable me
to gain experience in techniques that will inevitably support my independence."
10811568,"African American (AA) men have the highest incidence and mortality rate from prostate cancer in
the United States. We recently showed that AA men with low-risk prostate cancer have a two-fold
increased risk of death compared to men of other racial groups. While the causes of this stark
disparity are multifactorial, we hypothesize that prostate cancers in AA men harbor unique
genomic alterations that give rise to more aggressive prostate cancer. Towards this end, we have
performed an initial meta-analysis of existing sequencing studies and found candidate driver
genes associated with ancestry. However, the ability to determine the effect of these candidates
on prostate cancer biology is limited due to the lack of biological cell models from different
ancestral backgrounds. In Aim 1, we will find additional molecular alterations associated with
grade using whole genome sequencing of prostate cancer cases from 100 AA veteran men seen
at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Health Care System. In Aim 2, we will characterize the
transcriptomic states of different prostate epithelial cell populations by performing single-cell RNA-
seq of organoids derived from AA and EA men. In Aim 3, we will develop new prostate cell models
from AA patients using prostate organoids. We will then perturb ancestry-associated driver genes
and determine whether the functional effects of these genes are augmented in different ancestral
backgrounds. At the conclusion of these studies we will have expanded our understanding of the
molecular pathways that are associated with aggressiveness in different ancestral backgrounds.
We will also generate a resource of prostate cell models from AA men for the scientific community
to investigate prostate cancer disparities. This project will generate substantial knowledge of the
mechanisms that underlie prostate cancer disparities that could ultimately lead to improved
treatment of AA men with prostate cancer and the reduction of cancer health disparities."
10840997,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Behavioral inhibition (BI), a temperament characterized by fear of novelty, is the best behavioral marker
of which children are at risk for anxiety. However, the neurodevelopmental mechanisms that underly the
pathway from BI to anxiety remain elusive. Extensive evidence links BI and inhibitory control (IC) processes to
the development of anxiety. However, very little evidence has illuminated whether these behaviors are
associated with changes in brain connectivity. The goal of the proposed project is to precisely characterize
brain networks associated with BI, IC, and their interaction in infancy to illuminate the pathophysiology of
anxiety. To do so, during the mentored phase, I will characterize longitudinal changes in brain networks
implicated in BI (Aim 1), identify longitudinal changes in resting state functional connectivity that are associated
with both BI and IC (Aim 2). Subsequently, during the independent phase (R00), I will replicate and extend this
line of work to validate these findings using behavioral measures of BI and IC and identify the moderating
contribution that brain networks associated with IC have on the neural correlates of BI (Aim 3). Elucidating the
independent and interactive contributions of factors associated with anxiety is essential for generating
knowledge for targeted interventions. This research plan will advance my goal of developing an independent
funded research program investigating how brain development supports complex social and emotional
development. This line of work will target those individuals most at risk for atypical social and emotional
outcomes (e.g., those at risk for psychopathology) by charting the precursors to emotional disorders using
neuroimaging methods. To effectively lead my future research team, I require intensive training in infant
functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) data analysis and longitudinal modeling. To date, my training has
provided me with a strong foundation of skills in developmental psychology, infant behavioral assessment, and
infant fMRI data collection. My career development plan expands on this skill set to provide essential further
training in data-driven approaches for processing fMRI data (e.g., independent components analysis),
longitudinal modeling of fMRI data, and toddler fMRI data collection. By engaging in this protected training
time, I will enter my independent stage of research well prepared to lead my research team to identify neural
markers indicative of high risk for anxiety."
10830491,"Development of Spectral X-Ray Phase-Contrast Micro-CT
Project Summary
A challenging aspect of in vivo micro-CT relates to the required deleterious radiation dose levels - particularly
for studies required to follow the same subject longitudinally. The main constraint is the poor attenuation
contrast for x-rays in soft tissue and the need for long imaging times. Researchers have studied the use of
multi-energy (or spectral) x-ray acquisitions to perform material decomposition with micro-CT systems, but the
versatility of these methods is again constrained by the same contrast-dose trade-off. Phase-contrast imaging
(PCI) can provide significant phase-enhanced contrast at higher energies, thus potentially reducing micro-CT
dose. However, existing PCI methods still require high dose and long imaging times for accurate phase
retrieval. We have recently developed an algorithmic approach to spectral PCI that enables dose and imaging
times commensurate with attenuation imaging. Our hypothesis is that PCI performed under normal clinical
constraints can yield better tissue quantitation and small feature delineation at lower dose than attenuation
imaging. We shall develop a unique spectral micro-CT system with both PCI and non-PCI capabilities to test
this hypothesis. A key system component will be an innovative high-performance, high-resolution photon-
counting detector (PCD) to be developed jointly under this grant by the University of Houston and Advacam
s.r.o. Two non-interferometric PCI geometries will be evaluated. The first specific aim is to design the micro-
CT system based on considerations such as source kVp and the PCD sensor thickness, pixel size, and energy
bin configuration. PCI-specific criteria include magnification and the x-ray mask properties. Optimization studies
will be carried out for both the PCI and the non-PCI modes. For Aim 2, we will work with Advacam to develop
the wide-area, high frame rate and high Z sensor PCD for the system. The high-performance PCD will be
constructed based on Medipix3RX ASIC technology and will feature high resolution and built-in spectral
correction schemes and fast readouts. Under Aim 3, the micro-CT unit will be constructed and energy
calibration and correction schemes will be developed to allow efficient system performance. Our fourth specific
aim is to compare the performance of the PCI and non-PCI modes of spectral micro-CT with physical phantoms
and animal studies to evaluate the enhancement of low contrast sensitivity. In vivo studies using liposomal
iodine nanoparticles will examine the ability of PCI to distinguish differences in blood vascularity for treatment-
responsive and treatment-resistive prostate cancer models in mice."
11044580,"ABSTRACT
Recent reports from the American Journal of Public Health and the American Psychological Association
identified a critical need to examine mechanisms by which exposure to psychosocial stress in childhood
increases the risk for obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adulthood. Given there is a lag in time
before the impact of psychosocial stress experienced in childhood is expressed as disease in adulthood, these
calls-to-action urge researchers to investigate the role of modifiable factors over the course of childhood that
may mitigate risk for later obesity and CVD. The proposed mixed-methods study is uniquely designed to
answer these calls-to-action by examining how stress âgets under the skinâ to put children at higher
risk for later obesity and CVD, and ultimately health disparities by race/ethnicity. The main objectives
of this study are to: (1) comprehensively examine the relationships between multi-level psychosocial stressors
(i.e., individual, dyadic, household, societal) and their dimensions (i.e., severity, frequency, timing), biological
factors (e.g., hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis activity), and child weight and emerging CVD risk over
the course of childhood and (2) identify modifiable factors at the individual, parental, and familial level to
interrupt these stress pathways. The proposed study will build on and expand a prior parent R01 study
(HL126171). The parent R01 study is a two-phased, mixed-methods study including a prospective
epidemiological cohort study with 1307 diverse parent/child (ages 5-16) dyads (â200 each African American,
Hispanic, Native American, Immigrant/Refugee, White) and an embedded ecological momentary assessment
(EMA) sub-sample with 627 parent/child dyads (â100 per each racial/ethnic group). Data was collected at two
time points (baseline, 24-month follow-up). In the proposed study, online survey data and 7-day EMA data will
be continued at 48 and 72 months, allowing for a total of four waves of data collection. Children, who are now
ages 9-16 will be added to both the online survey and EMA data collection, in addition to participating in three
24 hr. dietary recalls and 7-day accelerometry. New biological measures (e.g., hair cortisol, body composition,
arterial stiffness) with children and parents, neighborhood factors (e.g., child opportunity and disadvantage
index) using geo-spatial measures, and societal-level factors (e.g., structural racism, sociopolitical shift,
COVID-19) contributing to psychosocial stressors will also be added at both time points. Human-Centered
Design multi-family focus groups will also be carried out to co-create intervention targets with families. This
study will provide breadth and depth in understanding the pathways between multi-level psychosocial
stressors and child weight and emerging CVD across important developmental milestones (e.g.,
puberty) and family life cycle stages (e.g., families with young children to families with adolescents).
Importantly, this study will identify modifiable factors (e.g., family adaptability/resilience) that mitigate the
negative impact of multi-level psychosocial stressors on child CVD that can be targeted in interventions."
10916165,"This K01 award resubmission outlines an intensive five-year research career development program
focused on multilevel behavioral intervention and dissemination and implementation science research to
increase and sustain uptake of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. Supporting the candidate's career
and research goals is a mentoring team comprised of experts in behavioral intervention research, advanced
biostatistics methods, and dissemination and implementation science as well as a clinical expert panel.
Completion of the candidate's training plan and research study will provide the candidate with the experience,
skills, knowledge, mentoring and pilot data needed to become a leading independent investigator in
developing, implementing and evaluating multilevel behavioral interventions to reduce the burden of cancer in
racial/ethnic minority groups, starting with increasing HPV vaccination rates.
 The HPV vaccine is a major public health breakthrough and is the optimal primary prevention strategy
against HPV-associated cancers. Widespread use of the HPV vaccine is expected to reduce the cancer
burden across all racial/ethnic group, as populations of color are disproportionately affected by HPV-
associated cancers. Despite CDC recommendations and the public health implications of full vaccination
coverage, HPV vaccine uptake among adolescents remains well below the Healthy People 2030 goal of 80%.
The National Immunization Survey reported that in 2019, only 54.2% of U.S. adolescents aged 13-17 were up
to date with the series. Preliminary data and a review of the literature suggest multilevel interventions that
address at least two levels influence show promise in increasing HPV vaccine uptake. The objective of this
proposal is to develop, implement and evaluate a multilevel (parent, primary care team, and clinic) intervention
aimed at raising adolescent HPV vaccination rates to the Healthy People 2030 goal of 80% for boys and girls
using a parallel group cluster randomized trial design. This study will assess the effectiveness of the multilevel
intervention on increasing the rates of HPV vaccination among patients aged 9-17 of a primary care network
and will identify barriers and facilitators for broad dissemination and implementation. This will be accomplished
through the following aims: 1) Refine and finalize a parent, primary care team and clinic ML intervention to
increase uptake and completion of the HPV vaccine series among adolescent patients of a primary care
network; and 2) Conduct and evaluate the effectiveness and sustainability of the ML intervention. The
proposed research is significant because it will contribute to the emerging field of HPV vaccination multilevel
intervention research and addresses the need for more scientifically rigorous, evidence-based interventions
that can be disseminated and implemented on a large scale. Successful adoption of widespread HPV vaccine
coverage programs will reduce racial/ethnic disparities in HPV-associated cancer by ensuring that the next
generation of Americans do not experience unnecessary deaths due to HPV-related cancers."
10904912,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cell senescence in human tissues is an irreversible cell cycle arrest state in otherwise proliferative cells, which
is a hallmark of aging that alters the tissue environments via senescence-associated secretory phenotype
(SASP) but may also play a beneficial role in tissue remodeling, regeneration, and wound healing. Lymphoid
organs play a vital role in hematopoiesis and immune function. How cellular senescence in these tissues is
associated with stress-induced or age-related functional impairment, what types or subtypes of senescent cells
are present and their spatial heterogeneity and how these cells impact the tissue environments remain poorly
understood, precluding the development of strategies to target senescent cells to improve healthspan/lifespan
or harnessing these cells or secreted factors to promote tissue remodeling and repair. A recent commentary
published in Cell by NIH identified five broad areas (atlases, imaging &visualization, biomarkers, model
systems, perturbation and validation) that would help propel the field forward. Our application will assemble a
multidisciplinary team to tackle all these areas and specifically, as a Tissue Mapping Center (TMC), will focus
on generating the molecular and cellular maps of cellular senescence and associated tissue environments in 4
primary and secondary lymphoid organs. Specifically, it will (a) collect, analyze, annotate, and share high
quality non-diseased human primary (bone marrow and thymus) and secondary (tonsil and lymph node)
lymphoid tissues, (2) develop and deploy a suite of high-resolution, high-content and high-throughput single-
cell & spatial omics technologies to characterize these specimens and paired biofluids, and (3) perform
integrated informatics to identify biomarkers of senescent cell heterogeneity and to construct comprehensive
molecular and cellular maps of cellular senescence and associated environments in these organs. Four major
biological analysis pipelines are: (1) single-cell high-plex (>40) protein secretome profiling, (2) single-cell
proteo-transcriptomic sequencing (scCITE-seq), (3) spatial proteo-transcriptomic sequencing at cellular level
(DBiT-seq for co-mapping whole transcriptome and a panel of ~300 proteins at cellular level with 10Âµm pixel
size), and (4) spatial molecular imaging (SMI) of ~1,000 molecular targets in FFPE tissues at single-molecule
subcellular resolution. With these unique tools, we will (a) characterize functional SASP heterogeneity and
identify biomarkers of SAPS in different cell types, (b) construct molecular and cellular maps in 4 human
lymphoid tissues, and (c) identify biomarkers of cellular senescence in tissue and the associated environments,
contributing to the resource building of SenNet. Since the immune function is central to the physiology of all
major organs, our study will provide insights to the role of senescent immune cells in development, aging, or
disease in other organs like gut, lung, liver, and kidney, representing a strong synergy within SenNet and the
wider scientific community."
10606584,"PROJECT SUMMARY
When people encounter an infectious agent or a vaccine for the first time, they develop an immune response to
that agent or vaccine. Some of the respondent cells may persist for years â even decades, becoming memory
T cells, so that if the infectious agent is again encountered, the subsequent immune response can be rapid and
exact. Since these cells must to persist for long periods, they have developed mechanisms to resist the normal
process of cell turnover, i.e., these cells withstand death signals. HIV infection is a chronic, manageable
disease that, as yet, cannot be cured due to the persistence of HIV in memory CD4 T cells that are resistant to
cell turnover and death. In T cells that are not memory CD4 T cells, replicating HIV produces HIV proteins,
which are toxic and kill the T cell. Paradoxically, when HIV is reactivated in memory CD4 T cells, these same
HIV proteins do not kill the cell. We believe the reason these memory CD4 T cells do not die after HIV is
reactivated, is that they are intrinsically resistant to cell death. Accordingly there are multiple levels of
regulation within cells that together determine whether a cell will, or will not undergo cell death. In broad terms
in order for a cell to undergo apoptosis (one form of cell death) two conditions must be met: (i) a pro-apoptotic
stimulus, and (ii) a permissive cellular environment, where anti-apoptotic machinery does not prevent
propagation of the pro-apoptotic signal.
Our laboratory group has studied how HIV causes the death of CD4 T cells, focusing on the HIV protease-
Casp8p41 pathway. During the course of this grant's last funding cycle, we discovered that Casp8p41 kills
cells by binding to the pro-apoptotic protein Bak. Conversely, if Casp8p41 binds the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2,
then HIV does not kill a cell, instead becoming a persistent, latently-infected reservoir cell. We have generated
novel and clinically relevant observations that antagonizing Bcl2 with a Bcl2 inhibitor (venetoclax) alters the
number of infected cells that die following HIV reactivation, reducing the HIV reservoir size. Similarly, we have
shown that after Casp8p41 is bound by Bcl2, the complex is polyubiquitinated and degraded by the
proteasome. Consequently, using clinically available proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib or ixazomib) causes
accumulation of Casp8p41, enhances infected cell killing, alters the number of dead infected cells following
HIV reactivation, and effectively reduces the HIV reservoir size. The focus of the current application is to
optimize these treatment approaches to: (i) test combinations of Bcl2 antagonists with optimized latency-
reversal strategies, (ii) test the effect of the most promising combinations on the lymphoid HIV reservoir, and
(iii) determine why some, but not all, patients cells respond to Bcl2 inhibition, testing the hypothesis that
polymorphisms, or differences in expression of key proteins involved in this pathway, differ between
responders and nonresponders."
10836037,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Influenza is a persistent viral disease worldwide, with high case counts leading to deaths and losses in
productivity yearly. In temperate regions of the world, such as the United States, influenza appears in annual
wintertime cycles, with the influences of changing seasons creating predictable patterns of incidence, despite
the fact that different subtypes and strains of the virus predominate during each season. In tropical regions,
distinct seasonal patterns are not well established for influenza, suggesting that annual or climatic forces may
not dictate transmission in these areas. The tropics include many resource-limited areas of the world where
respiratory disease research is underfunded and influenza vaccination is not prioritized. Transmission patterns
of influenza can be described through the use of mathematical models, which incorporate known biological
mechanisms, such as infectivity, recovery, and duration of immunity following infection, in order to describe the
dynamics, or population-level behaviors, of the virus. Models can incorporate cyclic patterns of influenza
dynamics, which can include both seasonal cycles aligning with a calendar year as well as nonannual periodic
cycles; models can also incorporate irregular epidemics, though this is more challenging to model and less
commonly seen in current literature. Irregular epidemics can be viewed as âregime switches,â which describes
transitions between endemic time periods with consistently low incidence and epidemic time periods with short
periods of elevated incidence. This study aims to investigate potentially cyclic or acyclic dynamics of influenza
in the tropics, using Vietnam as a case study. The first aim seeks to define patterns describing cyclic or acyclic
dynamics and then use a mathematical model to show under what conditions acyclic dynamics can exist.
Influenza characteristics that could allow acyclic dynamics potentially include duration of immunity following
infection, cross-immunity, and population structure. The second aim seeks to use the developed model as well
as influenza data from Vietnam to determine whether influenza dynamics follow cyclic or acyclic patterns.
Comparing these results to identical analyses using data from temperate regions influenza data will allow us to
compare the strength of annual cycles between tropical and temperate regions. The third aim seeks to identify
characteristics of influenza virus, population patterns, or external factors that may be able to explain the cyclic
or acyclic patterns observed in influenza dynamics in Vietnam. This will show what characteristics of influenza
or external factors provide the strongest predictions of future influenza incidence in Vietnam. Uses of the study
results include better informed and appropriately-timed vaccination strategies for influenza in Vietnam. The
main points of novelty in this study lie in the explicit testing for cyclic or acyclic patterns in the tropics, which is
less commonly investigated, and a mechanistic modeling approach to identify the potential causes of non-
annual behavior of influenza transmission in the tropics."

The vision of this proposed Artificial Intelligence, Modeling, and Informatics, for Nutrition Guidance and
Systems (AIMINGS) Center is to implement computational and data science approaches and tools to advance
nutrition for precision health in a way that accounts for the complex systems involved. Many existing data sets
include extraneous data, making them difficult to analyze at best, and at worst, prone to generating misleading
or biased insights. Thus, there is a need to for new approaches, methods, and tools to collapse and distill data
to make them more Artificial Intelligence (AI)-ready and ready for a range of different analyses. This coincides
with the goal of Project 1: to develop and utilize The Data Distiller for Precision Nutrition, a set of
approached and tools that can collapse and distill nutrition-relevant data to create datasets that are AI-
ready and ready for a range of other analyses. The first objective of the Nutrition for Precision Health (NPH)
program is to âexamine individual differences observed in response to different diets by studying the
interactions between diet, genes, proteins, microbiome, metabolism and other individual contextual factors.â
Given the type of missing data we face in nutrition, and the importance of establishing causal relationships
rather than correlations, there is a need for new imputation methods. To address this, Project 2, the Causal
Relationship Disentangler, will introduce new approaches for handling missing data while preserving
causal structure. Learning how to transfer causal knowledge and doing so with missing data is critical
for realizing the potential of nutrition for precision health. The NPH programâs other objectives are âto use
AI to develop algorithms to predict individual responses to foods and dietary patterns,â and âto validate
algorithms for clinical application.â This requires bringing different causal pathways together to understand how
they interact. Agent-based models (ABMs) can help and serve as ""virtual laboratories"" to predict how different
people may respond to a particular diet under different circumstances. Therefore, the goal of Project 3 (The
Virtual Human for Precision Nutrition) is to develop an ABM tool that can help better understand and
predict an individual's response to food and dietary patterns, while bringing together and accounting
for the interactions between genetic, physiological, and behavioral factors. However, focusing on the
individual alone will not be enough to address all aspects of NPH. Therefore, the Virtual Public Health
Precision Nutrition Laboratory (Project 4) will develop ABMs that represent and account for the
systems outside individuals such as their social, economic, and built environments. An Administrative
and Coordination Core will oversee all operations and a pilot program. A Data Systems Core (DSC) will
leverage the substantial computing resources of CUNY, West Point, and the Department of Defense to create
a flexible cloud-based architecture for data flow and a collaborative workspace. A Computational Systems
Core will provide resources and personnel to support the DSC and tool development/deployment."

10612793,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of all cancer deaths in the U.S. and worldwide. Lung cancer risk and survival
are heterogeneously distributed among U.S. populations. African-American men have a higher incidence of
and poorer survival from lung cancer than European-American men, even after adjusting for smoking and
socioeconomic factors. The tumor-specific biological factors responsible for the racial differences are not yet
understood. The goal of this project is to define the mechanisms by which the JAK/STAT3 pathway operates
as a key biological contributor of racial health disparities in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly
lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the most common histological subtype of lung cancer. Our preliminary data
suggest that LUADs from African Americans are more likely than LUADs from European Americans to have
JAK/STAT3 pathway mutations that directly induce persistent activation of Signal Transducer and Activator of
Transcription-3 (STAT3). STAT3 is an oncogenic transcription factor that is hyperactivated in many cancers. It
drives expression of genes that regulate anti-apoptotic responses, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, tumor
progression, and therapeutic resistance. The premise of this application is that the JAK/STAT3 signaling axis is
inappropriately activated by mutations that are more common in LUAD from African Americans than European
Americans, and that therapeutic intervention will be of clinical benefit to a molecular subset of patients with
LUAD. Given that the molecular subset is more common in African Americans, research on this topic could
help narrow the gap in health disparities. Aim 1 will characterize the molecular profiles in LUAD from African
Americans and European Americans focusing on JAK/STAT3 and impact on racial differences. In Aim 2, we
will utilize CRISPR-mediated genome editing on patient-derived models of cancer from LUAD tumors from
African Americans, and other models, to test the hypothesis that aberrant STAT3 activation results from
specific mutations in the JAK/STAT3 pathway, and that the mutations drive LUAD development and tumor
progression. In Aim 3, utilizing patient-derived LUAD xenografts primarily from African-American patients, we
will test the hypothesis that the JAK/STAT3 pathway mutations we identified can serve as predictive
biomarkers for effective antitumor response to STAT3 blockade in LUAD, and we will further clarify novel
biomarkers of effective tumor response. At the conclusion of this project, we will have uncovered a novel set of
biological determinants of NSCLC health disparities. If the results of the study support our hypothesis, they will
provide a path to future clinical trials that may improve the clinical outcome of LUAD patients and help reduce
lung cancer health disparities."

Ovarian cancer is the most lethal female cancer. When the disease can be diagnosed at early stage, there is
striking survival improvement (five year survival â¥ 90%), compared to late stages (â¤ 40%). However, currently
no early detection method for ovarian cancer has enough accuracy, and most tumors already progressed to
advanced stages at diagnosis. Furthermore, over 70% of the adnexal masses detected on preoperative
imaging are found to be benign after pelvic surgery. Current clinical tests rely on serum CA-125 and
sonograms to diagnose the ovarian adnexal masses. However, CA-125 is elevated by many common benign
conditions; and ultrasound imaging of ovary frequently misses small but malignant lesions. As a result, surgical
removal of the lesion and histologic evaluation remains the only gold standard for diagnosis. These limitations
dictate an urgent clinical need of a better preoperative diagnostic method with high detection accuracy, to
lower the mortality rate, reduce unnecessary surgeries and preserve the life choices for many patients,
especially young women at reproductive age planning for pregnancies. Here, we propose a completely
different route to detect ovarian cancer signals from the blood T cell repertoire. This is feasible because the T
lymphocytes recognize tumor antigens at initial stages, proliferate and alter the peripheral T cell repertoire.
Therefore, detection of cancer-associated T cells (CAT) in the blood provides an exciting novel opportunity for
non-invasive cancer diagnosis. However, no prior studies have achieved this goal because it is difficult to
identify CAT in high-throughput, as most of the cancer antigens remain unknown. To prepare for this task, we
developed the software TRUST and iSMART, to obtain antigen-specific TCRs from cancer datasets. These
tools have enabled us to produce a large training set of CATs, which allowed us to identify diagnostic TCRs for
the ovarian cancer patients. Following this result, we further developed DeepCAT, for pan-cancer prediction
using blood TCR sequencing data, and demonstrated over 99% specificity and 86% sensitivity in a pilot study
to predict ovarian cancer patients (n=14) from healthy donors (n=176). To develop this approach into a novel
ovarian cancer specific biomarker, we have established a biorepository to prospectively collect specimens from
patients with benign or malignant ovarian lesions and from healthy donors of similar age span, with related
clinical information. In Aim 1, we will generate TCR sequencing data of the new patient samples to develop a
novel, TCR-based ovarian cancer predictor using machine learning method. In Aim 2, we will combine this
approach with existing clinical tests to obtain a multi-modality biomarker, and independently test it using the
samples from the Uterine Lavage cohort led by Dr. Steven Skates. These Aims will be delivered by the PIs and
co-investigators with complementary expertise covering gynecological oncology, clinical cohort recruitment,
biostatistics, artificial intelligence, immunology and ovarian cancer biomarker development."

The intestinal epithelium is the fast renewing adult tissue and highly sensitive to genotoxic agents such as
radiation and chemotherapy. Acute gastrointestinal (GI) injury can be lethal in radiation victims or dose-limiting
in cancer patients, which can lead to chronic barrier dysfunctions that impair the quality of life in survivors.
Radiation induced enteritis was first described in 1897, while there is still no FDA-approved treatment, in part
due to limited understanding of how intestinal stem cell (ISC) injury is coupled to regeneration. We and others
have established that the cell-intrinsic p53 pathway governs ISC intestinal regeneration using high dose total
body irradiation (TBI) and abdominal irradiation (ABI) (with major bone marrow sparing) models. Our recent data
indicate a novel role of âNicheâ signals including innate immune signaling in intestinal regeneration. We
demonstrated that a highly temporal and dynamic acute and local inflammation is âreparativeâ, which is activated
by Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING)-dependent Type 1 Interferon (IFN) response following delayed mitotic
death to promote intestinal regeneration. Surprisingly, non-bone marrow (BM) STING plays a major role in acute
crypt inflammation and regeneration. Remarkably, a single administration of IFNÎ² given 48 hours after TBI or
ABI improved survival and intestinal regeneration in STING-deficient mice and WT mice. These data support
that inducible production of IFNÎ² is necessary and sufficient to promote ISC and intestinal barrier recovery from
radiation injury through a novel niche and immune-dependent mechanism. We will test this hypothesis with three
specific aims using in vivo and ex vivo mouse and human intestinal organoids coupled with in depth mechanistic
dissection. SA1. Dissect STING-dependent local IFNÎ² production in acute crypt regeneration. SA2. Elucidate
STING-dependent immune targets for ISC regeneration. SA3. Establish IFNÎ² as a novel target to enhance long-
term ISC and intestinal barrier recovery from radiation injury. The proposed studies will provide novel
mechanistic insights in radiation-induced ISC regeneration through epithelial and immune interactions in the
niche, and establish temporal STING/IFNÎ² signaling as a novel and normal tissue selective target to treat
radiation-induced acute intestinal damage."
11167039,"Abstract
We aim to move the field of genetics as applied to juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) away from the
identification of genetic associations and toward a mechanistic understanding of how genetic variants exert
risk-conferring effects. We will accomplish two major tasks now facing the field: (1) identification of the
variants that exert the biological effects that confer risk (the âcausal variantsâ); (2) identification of the genes
whose expression levels are altered by those variants (the âtarget genesâ). In accomplishing these aims,
we will also elucidate mechanisms through which those variants alter gene expression and cellular
functions.
 One of the striking findings from GWAS for many complex traits, including rheumatic diseases such as
JIA, is the frequency with which disease-associated genetic variants appear in the non-coding genome. As
in other complex traits, the JIA genetic risk loci are highly enriched for H3K4me1/H3K27histone marks,
epigenetic signatures frequently associated with enhancer function. This finding has led to the hypothesis
that genetic risk in JIA impinges on enhancer function, leading to transcriptional abnormalities that can be
observed in peripheral blood cells. In this application, we focus on CD4+ T cells, which our preliminary data
suggest are among the cells likely to be impacted by causal genetic variants in JIA.
 In Aim 1, we will identify causal variants based on distinct biological properties. We will identify histone
quantitative trait loci (hQTLs) in CD4+ T cells of children with JIA, i.e., regions where genetic variants are
associated with differences in read depth on H3K4me1/H3K27ac Cut-and-Run sequencing. We will use the
same approach as that previously used by our co-investigator, Dr. Gaffney, in his investigations into the
genetics of systemic lupus. We will then identify the variants within the hQTLs that alter DNA topology, a
critical determinant of regulatory function. Finally, from variants that pass both screens, we will use a
massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to identify those variants within the hQTLs that have a significant
influence on gene expression.
 In Aim 2, we will identify the target genes within the JIA risk haplotypes. The underlying premise of these
studies is that, although the causal variants may not impact the nearest gene, the majority of relevant
interactions will occur within the same topologically associated domains (TADs). Using Cut-and-Run data
that we generate in Aim 1 as well as H3K27ac HiChIP data and supplemented by our published CTCF
ChIPseq/HiChIP data, we will identify interactions between H3K27ac-marked regions on the risk haplotypes
and gene promoters, focusing on those within CTCF-anchored TADs. Knowledge of the 3D chromatin
structure, patient genotype, and RNAseq data will then allow us to identify the likely target genes of variants
on the risk haplotypes."
10721338,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to high mortality and morbidity amongst veterans and civilians. There
is an urgent unmet need for therapies to alleviate the long-term neurological deficits after TBI. Innate (microglia
and macrophages) and adaptive (T and B lymphocytes) immune cells play critical roles in neuroinflammation,
injury progression, and brain repair. Microglia/macrophages are highly plastic cells that execute both beneficial
and detrimental functions after injury. Our previous studies highlight a shift of microglia/macrophages at the
chronic stages of TBI toward a neurotoxic, pro-inflammatory phenotype that impairs tissue preservation and
brain repair. Therefore, identification of mechanisms underlying anti-inflammatory/reparative
microglia/macrophage responses may reveal novel therapeutic targets to foster a microenvironment permissive
for brain repair and long-term recovery after TBI.
 CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a specialized subpopulation of T cells known to alleviate
inflammation. We reported that Tregs exerted neuroprotection by targeting inflammatory dysregulation in stroke.
The effects of Tregs in TBI have not been appreciated until recently, and their mechanism of action is unknown.
We recently in vitro study show that Tregs activated by brain injury stimulate microglial polarization toward an
anti-inflammatory/reparative phenotype, which in turn promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation.
Using the controlled cortical impact model of TBI, we have obtained in vivo data showing that: 1) Selective Treg
depletion further deteriorates long-term sensorimotor and cognitive functional deficits and exacerbates brain
lesions in both white matter and gray matter up to 21 days after TBI. 2) Treg-depleted mice display worse cerebral
inflammation and more aggressive pro-inflammatory microglia/macrophage responses after TBI. 3) In contrast,
boosting Tregs using an IL-2/IL-2 antibody complex (IL-2/IL-2Ab) significantly reduces brain injury and improves
neurological functions after TBI. Given these new observations, the proposed studies will be the first to test the
mechanistic hypothesis that Tregs improve brain repair and promote long-term recovery after TBI by
polarizing microglia/macrophages toward an inflammation-resolving and reparative phenotype.
 Three Aims will be completed in a systematic fashion. Aim 1. Test if Tregs improve gray and white matter
integrity and enhance long-term functional recovery after TBI. Aim 2. Test if Tregs shift microglia/macrophages
toward an inflammation-resolving and tissue-reparative phenotype after TBI. Aim 3. Test if in vivo expansion of
Tregs with IL-2/IL-2Ab treatment post-TBI reduces brain lesions and improves long-term neurological recovery.
 This study will be the first to mechanistically define the role of Tregs in regulating microglia/macrophage
responses after TBI and to test the therapeutic potential of IL-2/IL-2Ab in TBI. If successful, these studies may
reveal a new therapeutic horizon for TBI and other neurological disorders that involve persistent inflammation
and diverse microglia/macrophages responses."
10829331,"Volumetric muscle loss (VML) is characterized by the loss of a significant portion
of skeletal muscle, leading to permanent damage to muscle structure and function.
VML results from major traumatic injury, and it is becoming increasingly more frequent
in military Veterans as a result of roadside explosions, gunshot wounds, and motor
vehicle crashes. VML contributes to long-term disability and $400 billion in economic
burden in the US annually. Traumatic injuries leading to VML are associated with
impaired endogenous muscle regeneration and revascularization capacity. Current
surgical interventions such as muscle flap grafting or scar tissue debridement are
associated with significant donor site morbidity and functional deficiency. Experimental
approaches using decellularized extracellular matrix scaffolds show limited benefit in
muscle recovery. Accordingly, a tissue engineering system that can restore normal
skeletal muscle structure and function remains lacking for treatment of VML. Since
skeletal muscle is composed generally of a bundle of parallel-aligned myofibers
interspersed with blood vessels that provide blood and oxygen to the myofibers, the
long-term goal of this proposal is to engineer vascularized skeletal muscle tissue
constructs that mimic the native muscle and vessel structure, in order to restore muscle
function after VML.
 The purpose of this study is to bioengineer skeletal muscle tissue composed of
skeletal muscle precursor cells and vascular endothelial cells in a parallel-aligned
nanofibrillar scaffold that augments cell survival, myofiber formation, and vascular
perfusion recovery in a murine model of VML. Owing to the importance of vascular
perfusion recovery, the scaffolds will also be engineered to release angiogenic growth
factors in the form of modified mRNA (mmRNA), which obviates genomic alterations.
The proposed objectives are designed to advance the understanding of how
intercellular interactions with parallel-aligned nanofibrillar scaffolds, along with transient
delivery of therapeutic mmRNA, can promote muscle and vascular regeneration.
 Accordingly, the Specific Aims are: (1) To engineer endothelialized aligned
skeletal muscle composed of muscle precursor cells and endothelial cells in an aligned
nanofibrillar scaffold that augments cell survival, myotube formation, and contractile
function in vitro; (2) To enhance the angiogenic capacity of endothelialized and parallel-
aligned engineered skeletal muscle using scaffold-mediated mmRNA delivery; and (3)
To quantify the therapeutic efficacy of endothelialized and aligned engineered skeletal
muscle with transient therapeutic mmRNA delivery in a murine model of VML. The
proposed studies are highly significant because they seek to improve the therapeutic
benefit of cell transplantation for treatment of VML, shifting away from the
transplantation of acellular scaffolds to pre-formed endothelialized muscle tissue
constructs with transient gene delivery for improved clinical outcomes in Veterans and
other patients with VML."
10816372,"ABSTRACT
Our recently published data show that memory B cells elicited by influenza infection reside in both lymphoid
tissues and the lung (Allie et al Nat Immunol 2019). Memory B cells in the lung do not recirculate and have
properties, including broad cross-reactivity, that distinguish them from their lymphoid counterparts. We termed
these cells lung-resident memory B cells or BRM cells. Influenza-specific BRM cells rapidly colonize the lung,
where they reside in both the lung tissue and the lung airways for months. Upon challenge infection, lung BRM
cells differentiate in situ and become antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) that contribute to secondary protection.
Our data also show that antigen deposition in the lung is essential for BRM cell formation â perhaps because
BRM cells are generated locally in inducible Bronchus-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (iBALT) or because BRM
precursors generated in lymph nodes need to re-encounter antigen in the lung in order to become resident in
that location. Taken together, these data suggest that BRM cells are an important component of immunity to
influenza, however we have only a rudimentary understanding of where BRM cells come from, how they are
selected, what antigens they react with and how they are recalled (or not) after vaccination or secondary
infection. Our central hypothesis is that BRM cells in the lung are formed from a distinct subset of
responding B cells, are uniquely selected for broad reactivity, and respond exclusively to respiratory antigens.
To test this hypothesis, we will take advantage of single cell methods that allow us to define individual B cells
by a combination of transcriptome (single cell RNseq), BCR clonotype (single cell BCRseq), DNA-barcoded
antibodies to surface markers (CITEseq) and affinity/specificity/cross-reactivity of BCRs cloned and expressed
as recombinant antibodies (single cell cloning). Using these methods to compare populations of influenza-
specific B cells in the lung, draining lymph node, spleen and blood over time and after challenge infection or
vaccination, we will be able to determine how memory B cells in various tissues (particularly the lung) are
related to one another, the depth of their selection, the extent of their cross-reactivity and how they can be
recalled by either vaccination or infection. This information will give us a clear path forward in designing
vaccines that elicit broadly reactive BRM cells that home to the lung and provide long-lived immunity against a
wide variety of influenza subtypes."

This proposal seeks to establish the KAPP-Sen Tissue Mapping Center Collaborative (TMC) as part of the Cellular Senescence Network: Tissue Mapping Centers effort {RFA-RM-21-008). Our application represents a multidisciplinary collaborative effort involving six leading institutions and aging research programs working together to characterize the distribution and biological heterogeneity of senescent cells in different healthy human tissues in full alignment with the objectives of the Cellular Senescence Network {SenNet).

KAPP-Sen brings together skills, resources and perspectives needed to address Sen-Net goals in the framework of the healthy human Kidney. Adipose tissues, Pancreas and Placenta. Given our ability to obtain full thickness skin tissues from individuals providing KAPP samples, we may explore the possibility of future collaborative studies with TMCs selected for their major focus on skin. Our six collaborating institutions located in Farmington. CT (UConn Health, Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine), Boston {Brigham & Women's Hospital, Joslin Diabetes Center), Rochester. MN {Mayo Clinic) and San Antonio. TX {UTHCSA) have all been carefully selected for their essential and unique individual contributions to the field and this effort.

Our objectives will be achieved through the following aims:

Aim 1 : Coordinate research activities across KAPP-Sen TMC Collaborative sites in support of Sen-Net goals towards mapping cellular senescence and its associated secretory phenotype in the healthy human kidney, adipose tissues, pancreas and placenta.

Aim 2: Obtain tissues from healthy kidney transplant donors {kidneys, fat, skin), C-section pregnancies {placenta, cord, fat, skin), outpatient healthy donor biopsies {fat, skin), beating heart brain dead donors {full pancreas) and IIPD/Prodo {dispersed pancreas).

Aim 3: Generate highest quality data pertaining to cellular senescence including scRNA-Seq, snRNA-Seq, spatial transcriptomics, immunohistochemistry and Telomere-associated DDR foci {TAFs) in all tissues

Aim 4: Perform high level integrative data analysis required for the creation of aUases of human cellular senescence in collaboration with other TMCs, CODDC and NIH staff."

Our group completed the natural history study of premanifest Huntington disease (HD) entitled Predict-HD
which evaluated over 1400 research volunteers who were healthy but had undergone the predictive test for
the gene that causes HD. Findings revealed that signs and symptoms of HD were evident up to 15 years
before the traditional diagnosis of HD was given in the clinic. From these data we were able to develop
models of prognosis, disease progression and prediction of HD onset. Disease-modifying clinical trials are
currently underway to slow the progression, or delay the onset, of HD. More recently, a collaborative group
published an assay to measure the amount of mutant huntingtin protein in the cerebral spinal fluid of HD
participants. Questions of central importance to the success of this measure for clinical trials require
investigation: (1) how reliable is the measure in the same person when repeated (intra-subject test-retest
reliability); (2) how reliable is the measure in the same person when analyzed by two different labs (inter-lab
reliability); (3) does the measure reflect disease symptoms (content validity); (4) does the measure predict
meaningful disease outcomes (prognostic validity); (5) does the measure track disease progression or
severity; and (6) how many (and what stage of HD) research subjects do we need to know with confidence
that an intervention is working (i.e., delaying onset/slowing progression)? The proposed research study will
address all of these limitations to more effectively test new experimental interventions such as gene therapies
and new drugs. Findings will immediately inform how the field should best design preventive clinical trials for
HD."
10873022,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The International Consortium on Brain and Behavior Copy Number Variants (IBBC-CNVs) is a collaborative
effort of 9 institutions with complementary experience and expertise in phenomics and genomics. The 22q11.2
and 16p11.2 loci are associated with significant risk for neuropsychiatric disorders across the lifespan. The
clinical presentations are heterogeneous, manifesting in a range of developmental neuropsychiatric disorders,
including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity, Anxiety, Autism Spectrum, and Psychosis Spectrum Disorders. Taking
a âgenetics firstâ approach of ascertaining patients based on known, homogeneous genetic etiologies will allow
us to overcome barriers posed by the genetic and phenotypic complexity of idiopathic developmental
neuropsychiatric disorders. We postulate that CNVs exert a large main effect on psychopathology, but the
nature and degree of psychopathology observed in CNV carriers is multifactorial, with contributions from
additional rare and common genetic variants, as well as environmental factors. Therefore, dissecting the
effects of major CNV hits as well as additional rare and common variants on dimensional measures of
psychopathology can elucidate the combined contribution of genetic mechanisms to psychiatric conditions and
build models of risk prediction. Notably, the presentation and course of psychopathology in the CNVs resemble
these features in idiopathic disorders. Therefore, beyond the specific genetic syndromes investigated, such a
cross-CNV effort will identify convergent risk mechanisms for developmental neuropsychiatric disorders that
are of relevance to the broader population.
 We propose to dissect dimensional measures of psychosis, social-emotional processing and neurocognition,
and their genetic and environmental modifiers, to elucidate the architecture of risk for neuropsychiatric
disorders in CNV carriers. Prospective evaluation with dimensional measures relevant to neuropsychiatric
disorders will be applied to a cohort of 2000 individuals with 22q11.2 and 16p11.2 deletions and duplications
(500 per group) and their relatives as feasible. In addition, categorical psychiatric diagnoses will be assessed
in CNV carriers. Recruitment for prospective phenotyping will leverage existing large cohorts that carry these
reciprocal CNVs, many of whom have already been ascertained and characterized with a range of phenotypic
measures. New whole genome sequencing (WGS) will be performed in CNV carriers that have not yet been
sequenced. We will also utilize existing genetic data from the largest available case-control samples
diagnosed with SZ, ASD, and ADHD in the PGC to generate polygenic risk scores. Finally, we will examine
family and environmental factors that contribute to the heterogeneity of presentation and developmental course
in CNV carriers. This project will establish common phenomic and genomic resources. Our ability to conceive
such a large-scale study capitalizes on our existing successful collaborations, complementary expertise, and
institutional commitments to achieve these goals."
10756080,"Enhancing regenerative capacities is a fundamental goal in medicine. As yet, the principles of salamander
regeneration to augment mammalian healing are not directly applicable. Here we propose using lizards, more
closely related to mammals yet exhibiting remarkable regenerative capabilities, as model organisms in a set of
studies aimed at manipulating skeletal regeneration capacities. While both salamanders and lizards regenerate
their tails, salamanders regenerate near-perfect copies of original tails, while regenerated lizard tails are known
as an âimperfect replicatesâ with several key anatomical differences compared to originals. The most striking of
these âimperfectionsâ concerns the lack of dorsoventral patterning and segmentation in regenerated lizard tail
skeletons. Progress made under our original proposal identified the signals regulating regenerated skeletal tissue
induction and patterning, creating the first dorsoventrally-patterned regenerated lizard tails. This renewal
proposal focuses on later stages of skeletal maturation that, given the proper signals, culminate in segmentation.
Our recent comparative analyses indicate that regenerated skeleton segmentation is dependent upon three
distinct milestones: (1) perichondrium patterning, (2) cartilage hypertrophy, and (3) periosteum formation. Both
salamander and lizard regenerated tail skeletons begin as unsegmented cartilage elements. Our preliminary
findings suggest a novel role for spinal cord meningeal tissues in regulating skeleton segmentation. Regenerated
salamander, but not lizard, meninges contain specialized cell populations capable of recreating embryonic
segmentation signals in adjacent perichondrium and initiating a signaling cascade that transforms the entire
regenerated skeleton. Some of these signals induce cartilage hypertrophy in salamander cartilage before anti-
ossification processes that dominate lizard skeletons have the chance to stagnate cartilage maturation. Other
signals missing in lizard tails allow salamander bone cells to survive and promote periosteum development.
Based on this comparative analysis, we hypothesize the feasibility of mechanistically based interventions to shift
the âimperfectlyâ regenerating lizard tail to phenocopy the âperfectlyâ regenerating salamander tail. The Aims are:
(1) Introduce patterning to regenerated lizard tail perichondrium by supplementing adult spinal cord meninges
with embryonic segmenting cells; (2) Induce regenerated lizard cartilage hypertrophy by interrupting anti-
maturation signals that result in dysregulated cartilage development; and (3) Promote periosteum formation
within regenerated lizard tails by inducing bone cell survival and recruitment. An integrated approach is
proposed, incorporating a unique, asexually reproducing lizard species with in vivo surgical manipulations to
deliver cells and bioactive agents toward manipulating skeletal development. We believe that this approach will
produce the first regenerated lizard tails with skeletons exhibiting cartilage maturation and segmentation. These
studies will contribute towards mechanistic understanding of a vertebrate regenerative process, and may lead to
improving skeletal healing in non-regenerative organisms, including humans."
10609859,"Stable and efficient synaptic transmission depends largely on the maintenance of a high
number/density of postsynaptic receptors at synaptic sites. At the neuromuscular junction
(NMJ), the synapse between spinal motor neurons and skeletal muscle cells, the mechanisms
that regulate the stability of postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) over the
lifetime of animals remain largely unknown. Recent studies from our lab showed that Î±kap, a
non-kinase muscle anchoring protein encoded within the calcium/calmodulin kinase II Î± gene,
plays an important role in regulating the stability of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs)
and the structural integrity of the NMJ. In view of these results, we propose in the first aim to
investigate the effect of Î±kap knockdown during the development of healthy neuromuscular
synapses. In the second aim we propose to investigate the effect of the gain of function of Î±kap
on the maturation and maintenance of compromised NMJs using mice deficient in the sub-
complex of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) (Î±-syntrophin and Î±-dystrobrevin). In the
third aim we propose to investigate the molecular mechanistic link between the DGC sub-
complex/Î±kap/ the deubiquitinating protease USP9X and the stability of AChR stability in mice
deficient in Î±-syntrophin/Î±-dystrobrevin, and USP9X. The outcomes of these studies will be
relevant for many neuromuscular diseases where the number and density of AChRs are
compromised."

10592337,"Project Summary
 It is increasingly evident that interspecies antagonism is intrinsic to life in the bacterial kingdom. And
yet, while our understanding of the antibacterial mechanisms bacteria employ in conflicts with their brethren
has recently grown exponentially, our knowledge of the means by which bacteria sense and respond to
antagonistic threats remains limited. In this proposal, we test the hypothesis that bacteria react to the presence
of an antagonistic bacterial competitor through the activation of a multifaceted defensive program. This
hypothesis grew from our discovery that Pseudomonas aeruginosa activates an extensive posttranscriptional
regulatory program in response to interbacterial antagonism. The pathway, which we term PARA
(Pseudomonas aeruginosa response to antagonism), is triggered when a subpopulation of P. aeruginosa cells
succumb to lysis as a result of an antagonistic attack. Detection of as yet unidentified molecule(s) in cellular
lysate leads to the activation of the small RNA-mediated Gac/Rsm global posttranscriptional regulatory
program. Activation of this response is crucial for P. aeruginosa survival during attack, as a mutant unable to
mount the response suffers a severe fitness defect during competition with antagonistic organisms. Finally, we
demonstrate that the defensive response requires multiple, simultaneously acting mechanisms, including
pathways of unknown function. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will characterize one such pathway, which we
name ARC1 (antagonism response complex 1). Our preliminary data indicate that ARC1 is a large membrane-
associated protein complex that provides P. aeruginosa protection against antagonism mediated by toxins
delivered by the type VI secretion system of a competitor species. Our studies of ARC1 will elucidate the range
of threats towards which it provides protection and provide mechanistic insight into its defensive functions. In
Aim 2, we will pursue complementary genetic and biochemical approaches directed at characterizing the signal
present in P. aeruginosa cellular lysate responsible for triggering PARA. Finally, in Aim 3, we move beyond P.
aeruginosa and ask to what extent the regulatory components behind PARA â the Gac/Rsm pathway â
function generally to defend against interbacterial antagonism in other Pseudomonas species. We also
examine the hypothesis that variability in the Gac/Rsm regulon reflects adaptation to the specific bacterial
threats encountered by different species. Through this work, we stand to answer longstanding questions in the
field, including defining the evolutionarily relevant function of an important global regulatory program and
providing a molecular characterization of a long elusive signaling molecule. Additionally, through the
characterization of ARC1, our work will define the mechanistic basis for participation of a conserved membrane
complex of unknown function in interbacterial defense. Overall, the proposed work stands to broaden our
understanding of the ways in which interbacterial antagonism shapes the course of bacterial evolution."

Cellular senescence is a stress-response, as well as a critical component of cell fate during development, repair,
resilience and normal aging. Deepening and broadening our investigations into cellular senescence in normal
condition will advance our knowledge of healthy aging as well as age-related disabilities, thereby leading to
integrated and inclusive approaches to Gero-Protection and Gero-Therapeutics. A comprehensive, high-
resolution, Atlas of cellular senescence in various human tissues based on multimodal and multidimensional
analyses is required to address this need. The Duke Senescent Cell Evaluations in Normal Tissues (SCENT)
U54 Tissue Mapping Center (TMC) will leverage the broad and world-leading expertise of Duke University School
of Medicine faculty to contribute to the overall goal of mapping senescent cells at single cell resolution in normal
human tissues of across age-span and demographics. We will take advantage of Duke's broad expertise in many
areas, including pulmonary critical care, lung and heart transplant surgery, translational research, and
bioinformatics, to collect high-quality normal tissue specimens for biobanking, multimodal, high-resolution
analysis, and data integration to fully characterize cellular senescence in human organs and tissues.
The Duke SCENT TMC will be organized around 4 Cores as required by SenNet:
The Administrative Core (AC) of this TCM will provide guidance and leadership to the other cores and
communicate with NIH Staff and the SenNet Consortium during the set-up phase to agree on common protocols.
The Biospecimen Core will establish best practices for prospective acquisition, preservation and processing of
diverse, high-quality normal healthy human tissues and associated biofluids.
The Biological Analysis Core will deliver state-of-the-art profiling, led by a team of highly accomplished
research scientists who have successfully utilized these specific platforms in conjunction with previous and/or
current senescent analyses.

This application features a close collaboration between bioanalytical (Dr. Reilly, Indiana University) and bio-

of the ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation system. The investigators contribute complementary expertise
and experience in a variety of disciplines ranging from proteomics, protein bioinformatics, analytical chemistry

mass spectrometry will be combined with biochemical and genetic assays to characterize the interaction between
the proteasome and its substrates to provide candidates for novel substrate receptors on the proteasome. At
The University of Texas at Austin, the biological relevance of candidates will then be tested in biochemical pro-
teasome assays and genetic yeast experiments. These assays will define the contribution of newly identified
components to substrate recognition and degradation by the proteasome and elucidate the molecular and struc-
tural origin of substrate selection and specificity.
Overall, we believe that this proposal will result in significant advances in cross-linking methodology and in our
understanding of how the proteasome recognizes and digests substrates."
10923841,"Senescent cells accumulate with age and are increasingly linked to a variety of age-related diseases. At present,
senescent cells are operationally characterized based on a set of morphological, biochemical, and molecular
properties. However, senescence is unlikely to represent a single uniform entity. Rather, analogous to what has
been learned from studying tumors, the cell type, in conjunction with the specific endogenous driver of
senescence, will likely determine the unique molecular fingerprint of a given senescent cell. Understanding this
fingerprint, like our understanding of the specific genetic alterations in a given tumor, will, in turn, inform prognosis
and response to therapy. Much of our understanding of the biology of senescence has come from experimental
animal models, while our understanding of senescence in human cells and tissues remains, at best, incomplete.
Similarly, while a number of exogenous stresses can trigger a senescent phenotype for cells in culture, the
physiological relevant drivers of human senescence are not known. Finally, while for proliferating cells,
senescence is characterized by a permanent withdrawal from the cell cycle, the relevant senescent cell markers
and biology for critical post-mitotic cells (e.g., cardiac myocytes, neurons) is not well established. To begin to
address these significant knowledge gaps, the TriState SenNet Tissue Mapping Center (TMC) will analyze
human lung and heart tissue to provide a high-resolution map of the senescent cell population in these organs.
With the combined expertise of the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University, Ohio State
University, and the University of Rochester School of Medicine, this consortium will provide a comprehensive
assessment of two organs linked to a variety of age-related diseases, one of which is largely post-mitotic. Our
analysis will involve in situ mapping using established targeted assays, as well as high-content unbiased
approaches involving single cell RNA/ATAC sequencing, proteomics, and spatial transcriptomics. In addition, as
part of our mapping endeavor, the TriState SenNet TMC will analyze the relationship between the initiating
trigger for senescence and the subsequent biology and phenotype of the senescent cell. This relationship will
be probed using precision cut tissue sections from human lungs and hearts that will be perturbed ex vivo by
specific senescent triggers. This procedure will allow us to increase the precision and sensitivity of detection and
localization of senescent cells in the lung and heart. Finally, we will purify and isolate senescent and non-
senescent cells from an individual donor lung and used these isogenic primary cells to deconvolute the
physiologically relevant driver of human senescence and delineate the molecular basis for the observed
selectivity of senolytic therapy. Together, this combined analysis of tissue and tissue slices/cells from the same
individual will provide an unrivaled, unprecedented, in-depth, high-resolution map of the senescent cell
population in the human lung and heart, define the physiological drivers of senescence, and provide a rational
approach to understand the therapeutic potential of senolytic therapy."

Secretions from oviducts are essential for preparing gametes for fertilization, processes conserved throughout
the animal kingdom. However, molecular mechanisms underlying oviduct physiology are largely unknown.
Recent studies from our lab have shown that secretory cells of spermathecae and parovaria, two types of
glands in Drosophila female reproductive tract, are functionally homologous to secretory cells in mammalian
oviducts and play essential roles for ovulation, sperm storage, and fertilization. With the wealth of genetic tools
we developed and capability of rapid and precise genetic manipulation, we propose to utilize this novel
Drosophila system to elucidate the conserved molecular mechanisms underlying secretory cell-regulated
ovulation and sperm storage. Particularly, we will characterize the role of conserved transcription factors
(NR5A-family nuclear receptor Hr39, GATA-family transcription factors Pannier and Serpent) in secretory cells
for sperm storage and ovulation. We will also identify the downstream targets of these transcription factors in
secretory cells to fulfill their roles and identify novel secretory factors for sperm storage using genetic screens.
This work will provide a comprehensive understanding of the secretory cell physiology in female reproductive
tract. The conserved nature of these signaling pathways will allow the knowledge gained from this study to be
further validated in other insect species as well as in mammalian and human oviducts. Therefore, this work will
ultimately reveal promising new drug targets for the alleviation of infertility, for novel contraceptive
development, and for controlling malaria-bearing mosquito population, all of which are highly relevant to human
health."
10846672,"Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is the most common inherited form of
intellectual impairment and most prevalent single gene cause of autism. FXS is caused by an expansion of 200
or more CGG triplets in the 5â untranslated region (UTR) of the FMR1 gene, which leads to FMR1 methylation
and transcriptional silencing. The loss of the FMR1 gene product FMRP results in excessive protein synthesis
in the brain, which likely contributes to several manifestations of the disorder.
 We performed deep sequencing of RNA from white bloods cells (WBCs) of individuals with FXS as well
as age-matched typically developing (TD) individuals. We found that hundreds of RNAs were up or down
regulated in FXS WBCs compared to TD. We also detected hundreds of RNAs that were mis-spliced in FXS
compared to TD. These mis-regulated RNA events were statistically significant and may constitute a robust
biomarker for FXS individuals. To our surprise, we also found that in 50% FXS WBC samples, FMR1 RNA was
synthesized. In these cases, FMR1 RNA was mis-spliced such that an exon was spliced to a âpseudo-exonâ
within an FMR1 intron. This mis-spliced RNA is polyadenylated and could encode a small polypeptide whose
function, if any, is unknown. We generated 2â-O-methoxyethyl (2â-MOE) antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that
tiled across the intron, the intron-exon junction, and into the pseudo-exon. When transfected into FXS WBC
lines, we found that two ASOs blocked improper FMR1 splicing, rescued proper FMR1 splicing, and most
importantly, restored FMRP to TD levels. We also detected FMR1 mis-splicing in FXS postmortem brain,
indicating the widespread nature of FMR1 mis-splicing in FXS individuals. These and other data suggest that
ASO correction of FMR1 mis-splicing and restoration of FMRP may provide an innovative therapy to treat FXS.
 To assess the therapeutic potential of ASO treatment of FXS, we will investigate the mechanism of CGG-
dependent FMR1 mis-splicing, determine whether additional ASOs with different linkages, lengths, or sequences
more efficiently inhibit FMR1 mis-splicing and restore FMRP, examine whether ASO rescue occurs in iPSC-
derived FXS neurons, and assess ASO toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and brain targeting following
intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection into mice."
10721829,"Alcohol use disorder and alcohol-related liver disease are a major cause of morbidity and mortality among
Veterans. Chronic alcoholism is associated with changes in the intestinal microbiota, increased intestinal
permeability, and elevated systemic levels of bacterial products. Results from our laboratory indicate that
intestinal pathobionts contribute to alcohol-related liver disease. Using an unbiased approach by metagenomic
sequencing we found significantly more virulence factors in fecal metagenomes from patients with alcoholic
hepatitis than patients with alcohol use disorder or non-alcoholic controls. The presence of the virulence factor
kpsM encoded in the genome of Escherichia coli (E. coli), is independently associated with mortality in patients
with alcoholic hepatitis. E. coli kpsM is involved in the synthesis and expression of the polysialic acid capsule.
Our preliminary data further shows that E. coli kpsM escapes phagocytosis by Kupffer cells. A subsequent
increase in hepatic inflammation contributes to the development of ethanol-induced liver disease. This is
supported by additional data demonstrating that colonization of gnotobiotic mice with feces from a patient with
alcoholic hepatitis positive for E. coli kpsM exacerbates ethanol-induced liver disease. We hypothesize that
pathobiontic kpsM-positive E. coli are an important etiological factor in the modulation of hepatic inflammation
and the development of alcohol-related liver disease. Our experimental approach is to correlate specific
virulence-related genes in the gut metagenomes with clinical outcomes of Veterans with alcohol-related liver
disease (Aim 1). We will investigate the molecular mechanism of how kpsM-positive E. coli contribute to
alcohol-related liver disease in vivo and in cultured liver cells (Aim 2). Using a precision-microbiome approach,
we will test the hypothesis that targeted manipulation of alcohol-associated dysbiosis can ameliorate ethanol-
induced liver disease (Aim 3). We believe these studies will provide novel insights into the contribution of the
microbiota to alcohol-related liver disease. Innovative and novel strategies will be developed to prevent or
ameliorate alcohol-related liver disease in Veterans."
10895599,"OVERALL TMC - PROJECT SUMMARY
 Cellular senescence is a multi-faceted cell fate that arrests cell proliferation and activates the synthesis
and secretion of numerous cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, proteases and lipids, termed the
Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP). The SASP can influence tissue microenvironments,
locally and distally, and thus senescent cells can strongly affect tissue function. Senescent cells (SnCs)
increase with age in most vertebrate organisms, including mice and humans, and it is increasingly clear
through both genetic and pharmacological manipulations that they can drive a growing list of age-related
pathologies, ranging from neurodegeneration to cancer. At present, there are no invariant biomarkers of SnCs
and the molecular characteristics of SnCs are remarkably heterogeneous and variable, depending on cell and
tissue type, microenvironment, senescence inducer, and timing. Our overall goal is to determine, molecularly
and spatially, when and where senescent cells occur in humans, and also how their patterns of gene
expression and SASPs vary with tissue physiology and age. These goals are also the goals of the SenNet
Consortium. We therefore propose to establish a SenNet tissue mapping center (TMC) comprised of an
Administrative Core, Biospecimen Core, Biological Analysis Core and Data Analysis Core. Our proposed TMC
will focus on three human tissues (ovary, breast and skeletal muscle) and three biofluids (follicular fluid,
plasma and urine). These samples have distinct biological characteristics and cell types (somatic and
reproductive; stromal, epithelial and vasculature) that show significant changes with age. All materials are
available through established collaborations, subcontractors and/or biobanks (through the Biospecimen Core).
Their analyses will include cutting-edge transcriptomic and proteomic techniques that will take advantage of
the expertise of several Buck Institute investigators. Our preliminary data show that these tissues and biofluids
are amenable to the state-of-the-art technologies proposed in the Biological Analysis and Data Analysis Cores,
as well as new technologies proposed in our accompanying Technology Development application (RFA-RM-
21-009). Importantly, our findings will be applicable to many other human tissues and biofluids in order to
encompass and complement the overall goals of the larger SenNet Consortium. The Administrative Core will
coordinate all aspects of the TMC, from specimen acquisition to analysis, and will oversee and facilitate
frequent interactions between the proposed TMC and other investigators, Cores and components of the
SenNet Consortium."
10584460,"Project Summary
Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness throughout the world and the second leading cause of
blindness overall in the USA. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and aging are the most important risk factors
for most forms of glaucoma. IOP level is highly dependent on the rate at which the aqueous humor is filtered
through the conventional outflow pathway containing the trabecular meshwork (TM). Reduced cellularity within
the TM and abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover occur in glaucomatous conditions and correlate with
increased outflow resistance, elevated IOP, and subsequent vision loss. The goal of this project is to define the
mechanisms of stem cell homing and engrafting to the TM tissue, activating regeneration of the TM tissue, and
hence restoring outflow facility, reducing IOP, and preventing vision loss. In our previous funding period, we
have identified the mechanisms of stem cell homing and integration are partially associated with CXCR4/SDF1
chemokine pair and Î±5Î²1 integrin. We have also confirmed that TM stem cells (TMSCs), after intracamerally
injection, can regenerate the TM tissue, reduce IOP, and preserve the retinal ganglion cell function in a mouse
glaucoma model. This project is designed to test specific hypotheses about the mechanisms by which human
TMSCs remodel the pathological TM tissue and restore the TM function. Specific Aim 1 tests the hypothesis
that TMSCs and differentiated TM cells remodel the abnormal TM ECM via the COX2/PGE2/MMP pathway.
We will utilize myocilin mutant TM cells and dexamethasone-treated TM cells as well as a mouse glaucoma
model with myocilin mutation to test how TMSCs promote the ECM turnover and modify the TM segmental
outflow pattern. Specific Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that transplanted TMSCs can promote endogenous
TMSC activation, migration, and function via the SOX21/WNT signaling. We will unveil if the endogenous
TMSCs are viable with a reduced number in aged and glaucomatous TM tissue in human and in mice and
uncover how TMSCs awake endogenous TMSCs via SOX21/WNT signaling. The scientific impact of this study
will be the elucidation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of TM regeneration potential by stem cells.
The results may also directly lead to the design of stem cell-based therapies or adjunctive treatments that
prevent blindness from glaucoma clinically."
10892220,"Project Summary
Animals have evolved circadian (near-24 h) rhythms to anticipate and adjust their behavior to daily
opportunities and challenges such as mating, food availability, and predation. These behavioral rhythms are
synchronized to the solar day by the central circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). SCN
neurons exhibit daily rhythms in firing rate and clock gene expression that communicate circadian time to the
rest of the brain and body. However, critically, we do not know how SCN signals interact with molecular and
neuronal clocks in downstream neurons to generate circadian outputs. Our labâs overarching goal is thus to
understand how circadian input from the SCN is encoded by target neurons to ultimately generate diverse
behavioral rhythms that peak at different times of day. To address this, over the next five years, our research
program will focus on several interrelated but independent themes, including defining the âtransfer functionâ for
circadian output circuits, determining how molecular clocks in target neurons contribute to behavioral
rhythmicity, and understanding how target neurons integrate diverse inputs to generate behavioral rhythms.
We propose that endogenous rhythmicity in downstream neurons and daily input from SCN neurons are each
required to drive appropriately timed circadian behavioral outputs. Here, we will use multi-level analysis at the
molecular, circuit, and behavioral levels including targeted genomic editing of clock genes, in vivo and ex vivo
imaging of rhythmic neurons, and machine learning analysis of behavior to dissect circadian output circuitry in
two complementary species, the nocturnal laboratory mouse and the diurnal African striped mouse. Curiously,
molecular and neuronal activity rhythms in the SCN peak at similar times in diurnal and nocturnal animals. How
does an ostensibly identical SCN rhythm determine these dramatically different temporal niches? Our
approach will allow us to address this and other long-standing questions in chronobiology by identifying both
the mechanisms that temporally organize behaviors and the differences in molecular and neural function that
decide an animalâs temporal niche preference. Identifying the genes, neurons, and circuits that regulate the
timing of behavior in both laboratory mice and striped mice will also provide a novel framework for
understanding the biological basis of chronotype in humans and the etiology of circadian rhythm sleep
disorders. The discoveries we will make through our research program can generalize beyond circadian
biology to reveal fundamental mechanisms linking genes and circuits to behavior."
10590594,"Project Summary/Abstract
 US rates of alcohol and drug use among youth remain problematic, and changes in youth use of opioids,
marijuana, and e-cigarettes have increased the need for prevention. Evidence-based programs (EBPs) for re-
ducing alcohol and drug use are not widely adopted by schools and are often implemented poorly. Although
studies show that schools do have time during the school day, multiple factors influence schoolsâ poor imple-
mentation including inadequate funding, teacher turnover, lack of confidence in program evidence, insufficient
support from school staff, poor alignment between programs and stated goals, and lack of technical assistance
to guide good implementation. A middle-school drug prevention program called Project ALERT and imple-
mentation support intervention called Getting To Outcomes (GTO) can address these factors and improve pre-
vention quality and youth outcomes. ALERT is a widely implemented middle-school program that is free, has
moved to all online teacher training, has been recently updated for new drug trends, and has promising evi-
dence for preventing drug use and reducing pro-drug risk factors, as rated by multiple online registries. GTO is
an intervention which includes training, manuals, and technical assistance that builds capacity for programs by
strengthening the knowledge, attitudes, and skills needed to choose, plan, implement, evaluate, and sustain
those programs. Previous studies in small community agencies have demonstrated GTOâs promise, but its im-
pact on school-based prevention fidelity and youth outcomes remains an empirical question. We propose a
study to assess the effectiveness of the updated ALERT in combination with an assessment of GTO implemen-
tation support. The proposed 5-year study compares the effectiveness of ALERT alone, ALERT+GTO, and a no-
intervention control group in a Hybrid II, cluster-randomized controlled trial of 42 middle schools across three
states. As a Hybrid II trial, we will test both the effectiveness of the revised ALERT curriculum and teacher
training method as well as the GTO implementation support. Although generic GTO tools are available, in this
study we will tailor those tools specifically for ALERT. We will evaluate both implementation outcomes (e.g.,
staff capacity, program fidelity) and outcomes of substance use such as alcohol, marijuana, e-cigarette, and opi-
oid use; and pro-drug risk factors such as resistance self-efficacy, perceived peer norms, and beliefs among
3,088 middle-schoolers. A successful demonstration of ALERT+GTO could fundamentally transform evidence-
based preventionâs reach and quality where most youth areâUS schools. That is because ALERT is an imple-
mentation-friendly program (free, accessible) that is already being employed by thousands of schools and
RAND would offer all the GTO support to schools for free after the study. If successful, the new ALERTâsup-
ported by GTO tools and guidance tailored to ALERTâwould be one of the easiest EBPs for schools to adopt or
continue implementing but with improved quality."
10721343,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major health challenge that causes recalcitrant multi-drug resistant
infections, especially in immunocompromised and hospitalized patients. Multi- and pan-drug resistant strains of
P. aeruginosa are increasing threats that contribute to high mortality in these patients (1-3). Hence, there is an
urgent need to develop new strategies to combat P. aeruginosa and other resistant pathogens. The pathogenic
profile of P. aeruginosa is related to its ability to secrete a variety of virulence factors. Novel therapeutic
strategies that strengthen the ability of the host would enhance immune defenses and improve outcomes. Over
the previous funding cycle, we elucidated the mechanisms by which lipid mediators regulate the lungâs innate
immune responses to P. aeruginosa virulence factors (5-8). We discovered that 15d-PGJ2, stimulates host
responses to P. aeruginosa through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARï§), a ligand-
activated transcription factor (9-11). Further, we showed that PPARï§ agonists inhibit P. aeruginosa biofilm
formation and enhance bacterial clearance from the lungs. Studies to determine the mechanisms by with
PPARï§ modulates host response in epithelial cells revealed that P. aeruginosa : 1) inhibit paraoxanase-2, a
key mitochondrial enzyme that hydrolyses C12-HSL (12, 13), and 2) inhibit PPARï§ coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-
1Î±) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), disrupting mitochondrial biogenesis and bioenergetics
(14,15). These mitochondrial derangements impaired epithelial ATP production, increased reactive oxygen
species (ROS), and enhanced glycolysis to disrupt epithelial barrier integrity and immune function. Most
importantly, our new data show that PGC-1Î± overexpression or activation rescues mitochondrial bioenergetics
and epithelial junctional integrity preventing bacterial transmigration in vitro and enhancing clearance of
bacteria in lungs of mice infected with P. aeruginosa in vivo. Therefore, we hypothesize that P. aeruginosa
evades host defenses by disrupting mitochondrial biogenesis, epithelial barrier integrity, and immune
function. Strategies to restore PGC-1Î± provide a novel therapeutic approach to stimulate mitochondrial
biogenesis and enhance immune function in P. aeruginosa lung infections. To test this hypothesis, we propose
three specific aims: 1) Investigate the molecular mechanisms by which P. aeruginosa attenuates PGC-1Î± in
host lung epithelial cells.2) Elucidate how attenuation of PGC-1Î± compromises host epithelial barrier and
immune function in response to P. aeruginosa. 3) Define the impact of rescuing PGC-1Î± activation and
mitochondrial biogenesis in P. aeruginosa pneumonia in vivo. The PIâs investigative team provides needed and
complementary expertise to advance this paradigm-shifting work focused on enhancing host resistance to
invasive pathogens. Successful completion of these integrated studies will provide new insights into the
molecular pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa-induced airway epithelial cell dysfunction (Aim 1), define novel
pathways perturbing critical host cell functions (Aim 2), and explore new therapeutic paradigms for restoring
cell functions involved in host defense (Aim 3). The overarching goal of this proposal is to define novel
molecular approaches to rescue host mitochondrial function and immune responses to pathogens such as P.
aeruginosa. The impact of these studies is further enhanced by their potential relevance to other pathogens
and by the exploration of existing pharmacological tools permitting rapid clinical translation and benefit to
veterans infected with virulent pathogens."
10606475,"Physical, emotional, and financial burdens are especially demanding for older cancer patients undergoing
autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT), which requires prolonged hospitalizations or daily visits in
outpatient clinics for 3-4 weeks and caregivers to be available 24/7. Home HCT is a novel strategy that provides
intensive support, integrated care management, and individualized interventions focused on helping patients and
caregivers manage care at home, with the potential to improve patient quality of life, reduce caregiver strain, and
decrease healthcare utilization and costs.
Building on our successful phase 1 home HCT pilot, we propose a randomized phase 2 trial of home vs.
standard autologous HCT. In contrast to standard hospital-based care, providers of home HCT make daily house
calls, working with patients and caregivers to form individualized treatment plans that facilitate management of
HCT complications at home. Home-based care may have many advantages, particularly for older adults, and
home HCT may result in better patient quality of life (remaining in their normal environment), better activity (easier
to walk around the home or neighborhood than crowded hospital corridors), better nutrition (home vs. hospital
food), better sleep (home vs. hospital bed), etc. Additionally, logistics are vastly simplified for caregivers who
donât need to drive back-and-forth daily, which could decrease caregiver strain, anxiety, and fatigue, thereby
improving caregiver quality of life; in addition, this may free caregivers to provide more support for patients,
further improving patient outcomes. In addition, increased confidence and ability to take care of patients at home
may reduce emergency room visits and readmissions. Though upfront staffing costs may be higher, overall
health system costs may be lowered by reducing complications and keeping patients out of the hospital.
Our first aim is to determine the impact of home HCT on patient health, quality of life and function,
including overall quality of life (FACT-BMT, primary endpoint), symptoms, physical function, cognitive function,
fatigue, sleep, nutritional status, mental health, social support, self-efficacy, out-of-pocket costs, and return to
work. Our second aim is to determine the impact of home HCT on caregiver well-being, including many of the
above measures as well as caregiver strain (caregiver strain index, primary endpoint), burden, and satisfaction.
Qualitative studies are part of both aims to better understand which aspects of home HCT are most impactful
and may be applied to other diseases; this is especially important for planning future studies and implementation.
The third aim is to determine the effect home HCT on healthcare utilization outcomes such as readmissions,
length of stay, and overall costs. The long-term objectives are to improve outcomes for patients and caregivers
by supporting their care at home; keeping patients at home and out of the hospital may in turn reduce costs. The
success of this study may serve as a model for other strategies to reduce caregiver burden and keep patients
out of the hospital by delivering quality care at home."
10762442,"Project Abstract
 Infections by the motile bacterial species, Helicobacter pylori, are promoted by chemotaxis, which
refers to the ability to migrate towards favorable chemical environments. H. pylori infections are a major cause
of peptic ulcers and gastric cancers. Yet, the biophysical mechanisms of chemotaxis in H. pylori are not
understood. In the canonical chemotaxis network, chemoreceptors sense extracellular ligands and regulate the
activity of a chemotaxis kinase. The kinase in turn modulates flagellar functions to bias bacterial migration. To
prevent the network from desensitizing upon ligand-detection, two enzymes, CheR and CheB, continuously
reset the kinase activity. Such resetting (adaptation) increases the dynamic range of ligand sensing in the
network, without which the cell cannot continue migrating up or down chemical gradients. However, H. pylori
lack CheR and CheB homologues. Also, the pattern of motility in H. pylori is different from the standard model,
Escherichia coli, since H. pylori localize all their flagella at a single pole â individual cells swim forward (run)
and backward (reverse), rather than running and tumbling as E. coli do. This subtle difference in motility is
predicted to give rise to multiple chemotaxis errors in the canonical framework. Hence, current mechanistic
models of chemotaxis are unable to explain biased and error-free migration in H. pylori. Without a fundamental
understanding of chemotaxis in H. pylori, the development of antibacterials that target chemotaxis will likely
remain limited. In the proposed work, the PIâs primary goal is to explain how the chemotaxis network
modulates flagellar functions to promote chemotaxis in H. pylori. The PIâs long term goal is to use the insights
from the proposed work to develop innovative methods to prevent H. pylori infections by inhibiting chemotaxis.
The PI will make use of a novel technique that overcomes the status quo by allowing quantification of flagellar
functions without probing individual flagellar motors. Through a combination of optical tweezers, phase
microscopy, and stochastic modeling, the PI will determine how chemotaxis errors are prevented at a single
cell and population level in H. pylori. The team will pioneer the development of novel assays, including a FRET
assay, to experimentally measure chemotaxis signaling in H. pylori. The PI will also determine the role of key
coupling proteins that have been hypothesized to play a major role in chemotaxis adaptation. In addition to
establishing the biophysical principles of chemotaxis in H. pylori, the following payoffs are anticipated: 1) a
paradigm will be established for understanding chemotaxis migration in other run-reversing species, 2) novel
mechanisms of chemotaxis adaptation are likely to be elucidated, 3. a FRET-based assay will be developed,
which will significantly boost current efforts in the field to understand chemoreceptor functions and chemotaxis
signaling mechanisms in H. pylori. Successful execution of the projects will enable a major advance since
chemotaxis strategies remain poorly understood in a large majority of bacterial species."
10654519,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 500 million people worldwide, with the greatest burden among older
adults. People with CKD are at elevated risk for not only end-stage kidney disease, but also cardiovascular
disease, heart failure, and death. Existing treatment for CKD is inadequate, and there is vast, poorly
understood heterogeneity in disease progression. While genome-wide association studies have identified
genetic variants that modulate CKD-associated risk, much of the hereditability of CKD, as well as the molecular
basis for how identified variants regulate disease, remains unexplained.
 Our overarching hypothesis is that an integrated approach combining genetics, epigenetics, proteomics,
and metabolomics can yield novel insights into the pathogenesis and prognosis of CKD. Variability in disease
may be due in part to variability in DNA methylation, which changes with age and the metabolic milieu and can
modify gene expression. Advances in high-throughput technology have revolutionized the breadth and
precision of metabolomic and proteomic profiling, enabling unprecedented windows into trans-omic networks.
The objective of this study is to use a systems biology approach to integrate genetic sequence variation with
DNA methylation patterns, proteomics, and metabolomics in order to advance our understanding and
treatment of CKD risk.
 The proposed grant will pursue biological pathways that affect CKD risk in the ongoing Atherosclerosis
Risk Communities (ARIC) study, a contemporary, community-based cohort of white and black adults now aged
70 years and older, with plan for replication in two CKD cohorts and further extension to kidney tissue. The
combination of rich phenotyping, comprehensive adjudicated outcomes, and genetic, epigenomic (funded by
this grant), proteomic, and metabolomic data provides a unique opportunity to generate insights into the
molecular basis of CKD, improve CKD risk prediction, and identify a series of candidate pathways and genes
whose products may serve as targets for drug development.
 With the long-term goal of improving care in patients with CKD, we aim to discover associations between
kidney function and metabolites, proteins, and related pathways (Aim 1), identifying specific pathways that
provide insight into CKD-associated outcomes, including CKD progression, heart failure, cardiovascular
disease, and mortality (Aim 2), and elucidate genetic and epigenetic variation underlying these candidate
pathways (Aim 3). The study will use a combination of innovative methods and omics data to identify pathways
and genetic variation that are clinical relevant and thus useful in informing the risk prediction and potentially
treatment of patients with CKD."
10828410,"Title: Cellular and Metabolic Basis of the Role of CYP1B1 in Liver Fibrosis
Abstract
Liver fibrosis is often resulted from chronic liver injury. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the primary hepatic
myofibroblasts responsible for the production of extracellular matrix proteins. As such, activation of HSCs is
central to the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. There are no FDA approved anti-liver fibrosis drugs.
Understanding the molecular basis of HSC activation will help to develop strategies to treat liver fibrosis.
Among the proposed mechanisms of HSC activation, autophagy activation has been shown to promote HSC
activation.
The cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) is a NADPH-dependent heme-thiolate monooxygenase initially
recognized as a xenobiotic enzyme that metabolizes xenobiotics. Subsequent studies suggest that CYP1B1
also has endobiotic functions by metabolizing endobiotics. The role of CYP1B1 in liver fibrosis has not been
reported. The liver is an organ of multiple cell types. It is unclear whether CYP1B1 has a cell-type specific role
in liver fibrosis. Specifically, whether and how CYP1B1 plays a role in HSC activation and liver fibrosis warrant
studies.
Our preliminary results showed that: 1) The expression of CYP1B1 is induced in fibrotic human and mouse
livers; 2) CYP1B1 is highly expressed in primary mouse and human HSCs, and the expression of CYP1B1
increases with the onset of HSC activation independent of AhR; 3) Ablation or pharmacological inhibition of
CYP1B1 inhibits HSC activation; 4) Whole-body knockout of Cyp1b1 inhibits liver fibrosis in vivo; 5)
Metabolomic analysis reveals that HSCs isolated from Cyp1b1 KO mice have an accumulation of trehalose, a
non-reducing disaccharides; 6) Trehalose inhibits HSC activation and liver fibrosis by functioning as an HSC
specific autophagy inhibitor; 7) The accumulation of trehalose in Cyp1b1 KO mice is accompanied by the
intestinal suppression of trehalase (Treh), the trehalose-metabolizing enzyme; and 8) The Cyp1b1 and Treh
genes are putative transcriptional targets of Wilmsâ tumor 1 (WT1) and RARa, respectively.
Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that Cyp1b1 has a cell-type specific role in HSC activation
and liver fibrosis. Specifically, we hypothesize that HSC and/or HEP ablation or pharmacological
inhibition of Cyp1b1 inhibits HSC activation and liver fibrosis. Mechanistically, inhibition of Cyp1b1
attenuates HSC activation by suppressing the intestinal trehalase, leading to the accumulation of
trehalose, a non-reducing disaccharide that can inhibit HSC activation and liver fibrosis. We propose
four specific aims to test our hypothesis: 1) To determine the cell-type specific role of Cyp1b1 in liver fibrosis in
vivo; 2) To determine whether pharmacological inhibition of Cyp1b1 inhibits liver fibrosis in vivo; 3) To
determine the role of trehalose and trehalase (Treh) in mediating the anti-fibrotic effect of Cyp1b1 inhibition;
and 4) To determine the transcriptional mechanism of fibrosis-responsive induction of Cyp1b1 and Cyp1b1
inhibition-responsive suppression of trehalase.
This study represents the first attempt to evaluate the cell-type specific role of CYP1B1 in liver fibrosis. Our
study will uncover a previously unrecognized endobiotic function of CYP1B1 in liver fibrosis mediated by the
liver-intestine organ crosstalk and the trehalose metabolite. Trehalose is a novel anti-fibrotic agent that inhibits
HSC activation by functioning as an HSC-specific autophagy inhibitor. Pharmacological inhibition of Cyp1b1
and/or the use of trehalose represent novel strategies for the clinical management of liver fibrosis."
10841723,"ABSTRACT: This proposal aims to address the long-term challenge of range uncertainties in proton
radiotherapy (RT) by developing a novel 3D prompt gamma imaging (PGI) system for in vivo dose verification.
Proton RT can potentially achieve better normal tissue sparing than photon RT due to proton beamsâ finite
range and Bragg peak (BP) in dose deposition. The number of proton centers in the US has increased by over
40% in the past 4 years. However, despite the promise and rapid growth of proton RT, its treatment efficacy is
severely limited by uncertainties in the proton beam range (i.e., the precise location of BP in the patient) arising
from daily patient setup errors, anatomic change, and dose calculation uncertainties. To account for this,
larger-than-desirable treatment margins (potentially>1cm) are added around the tumor in practice to ensure
adequate dose coverage. These margins significantly increase the dose to adjacent healthy tissues, leading to
an increase in radiation-induced toxicities. Concerns of increased toxicities, in turn, constrain the dose that can
be prescribed to the tumor and thus limit the tumor control we can achieve. Therefore, there is a significant and
critical need to overcome beam range uncertainties so that the true potential of proton RT can be fully
exploited. PGI has become a promising technique to verify and minimize range uncertainties by imaging the
prompt gamma (PG) signals emitted from the non-elastic proton-nucleus interactions during proton RT. In our
prior NIH-funded research, we developed a prototype PGI system that demonstrated the world's first 3D
images of PG emission from clinical proton beams with a range shift detection accuracy of ~3 mm. Despite the
early success, our system had several critical barriers that prevented it from being translated, including limited
count rate of the Compton camera, crude PG image quality with artifacts and severe distortion due to parallax,
and lack of dose estimation. In this grant, we will revamp the entire system with both hardware and software
innovations to overcome current barriers to achieve high precision 3D dose verification. The following aims will
be pursued: (1) develop, integrate and synchronize a quad-camera PGI system into the proton RT machine,
(2) develop novel image processing and reconstruction methods to achieve high-precision 3D dose verification,
and (3) perform a pilot patient study to evaluate its clinical impact. We have formed a top-tier academic
(Maryland) and industry (Varian) partnership with complementary expertise and a track record of collaboration
to ensure the success of the project. Our collaborative development and translation of the PGI system will be a
major step toward fulfilling our long-term goal of improving the efficacy of proton RT by minimizing its range
uncertainties. Our PGI system will be the first to provide truly 3D online dose verification during proton
treatment delivery, which can lead to a paradigm shift toward high-precision proton RT. This breakthrough will
unleash the full potential of proton RT to use minimal treatment margin to achieve optimal tumor control with
reduced toxicities for the growing number of cancer patients treated by proton RT in the US and worldwide."

Chemotherapy remains the standard of care for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which
affects 20% of patients with breast cancer. However, 50% of patients with localized TNBC treated with
neoadjuvant chemotherapy display residual cancer burden after treatment and up to 25% of patients who
receive this treatment will suffer metastatic recurrence within five years. The poor association between
chemotherapy and patient outcome emphasizes two major problems for TNBC patients: chemoresistance,
where tumor cells within the local environment are protected and do not die in response to chemotherapy, and
chemotherapy-induced metastasis, where chemotherapy-induced changes in tumor intrinsic properties and the
tumor microenvironment drive invasion which leads to recurrence. Previous studies have demonstrated that
cell migration and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling are associated with chemoresistant TNBC. The goal
of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms by which the ECM contributes to chemoresistance and
chemotherapy-induced metastasis in TNBC.
We provide preliminary data that individual proteins upregulated in TNBC tumors drive resistance to
chemotherapy drug Paclitaxel and that expression of Cathepsin B (CTSB), a protease which degrades these
ECM proteins into small fragments, protects against the development of chemoresistance. We will dissect the
mechanism by which the protease CTSB and the ECM proteins it degrades influence response to Paclitaxel in
TNBC and whether these fragments can be used to track and target chemoresistance in vivo. We have also
found that chemotherapy treatment leads to changes in the ECM composition of mammary tumors.
Specifically, Paclitaxel treatment leads to an increased abundance of Collagen IV, an ECM protein which
promote invasion and metastasis in TNBC. Our goal is to determine the cell types that secrete ECM proteins
such as Collagen IV after chemotherapy treatment, determine the contribution of these ECM proteins to
chemotherapy-induced metastasis, and whether these pathways can be targeted to prevent the development
of recurrence.
Upon successful completion of the proposed research, our contribution is expected to be an understanding of
how ECM proteins upregulated in TNBC tumors contribute to chemoresistance and how chemotherapy alters
the ECM to promote recurrence and metastatic dissemination. These contributions will be significant because
all TNBC patients receive chemotherapy and metastatic recurrence is a current unmet clinical need. Results
from these studies will provide novel conceptual insights on mechanisms of chemoresistance and
chemotherapy-induced metastasis and will allow us to develop new strategies to track, predict and overcome
chemoresistance in TNBC."
10596635,"For language comprehension to succeed in noisy and ambiguous environments, the human brain must use
contextual information to actively predict upcoming linguistic inputs. Impairments in top-down prediction are
thought to contribute to language and communicative dysfunction in a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders,
from the reading disabilities associated with dyslexia, to the profound social and communicative dysfunctions
that characterize schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder. In neurotypical adults, linguistic prediction is
known to modulate neural activity within a left-lateralized fronto-temporal network. However, little is known about
the computational mechanisms that determine the timing of feedforward and feedback activity across this
network. This grant asks whether these neural dynamics can be explained by predictive coding â a unifying
theory of perceptual and cognitive function. According to predictive coding, the brain infers the meaning of
sensory inputs by minimizing prediction error across multiple levels of the cortical hierarchy. To test this theory,
this grant proposes a series of experiments using three complementary neuroimaging techniques ââ
magneto-encephalography (MEG), electroencephalography (EEG) and functional MRI ââ to probe the
timecourse and location of neural activity to incoming words during language comprehension. Computational
simulations using an implemented predictive coding model of language processing will serve as a powerful
complementary research tool, allowing for the testing of explicit, computationally motivated hypotheses. Aim
1 (EEG/MEG) will test the hypothesis that the timecourse and localization of evoked (phase-locked) neural
activity within the left temporal cortex can be explained by prediction error at multiple levels of linguistic
representation. Aim 2 (MEG/EEG) will use Representational Similarity Analysis to directly capture neural pre-
activation of specific words at different levels of linguistic representation in predictive sentence contexts. These
methods will also be used to track the timecourse of converging on sharpened neural representations after word
onset in both predictive and non-predictive contexts. In both these Aims, computational simulations using the
same items will proceed in parallel with these neuroimaging studies, guiding interpretation. Aim
3 (MEG/EEG/fMRI) asks whether the principles of dynamic predictive coding framework can explain how the
brain is able to flexibly shift away from prior predictions in order to rapidly infer a new underlying message.
Specifically, this Aim asks whether these principles can explain neural activity at the highest level of the fronto-
temporal language hierarchy â the left inferior frontal cortex â as well as top-down feedback to lower cortical
regions at a later stage of processing. By directly linking the neurobiology of language comprehension to a central
theory of human cortical function, this project will identify core neural and computational mechanisms that may
be disrupted in multiple language disorders. It therefore lays the foundation for the development of targeted,
theoretically motivated neurocognitive strategies for the treatment and prevention of communicative disability."
10694320,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dementia with Lewy body (DLB), Parkinsons Disease (PD) and Alzheimers Disease (AD) are among the most
debilitating neurodegenerative disorders that afï¬ict patients in all countries and of all nationalities. One of the
Alzheimer related dementias (ADRD) national research priorities for DLB is to develop and validate imaging
techniques to improve the differential diagnostic accuracy of DLB versus other diseases. Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) is currently one of the most widely used diagnostic imaging techniques for detection of neuro-
degenerative disorders. However, standard T1 and T2-MRI may not provide the needed sensitivity and speciï¬city
for differential diagnosis of DLB vs. AD and PD. Recently, Diffusion MRI (dMRI), speciï¬cally Diffusion Tensor
Imaging (DTI), has exhibited better sensitivity to the detection of some of these disorders. However, DTI is known
for its inability to cope with complex ï¬ber geometries prevalent in the brain. This limitation can however be over-
come by using sophisticated mathematical models in conjunction with high angular resolution diffusion imaging
(HARDI). Our preliminary data suggests that learned micro-structural features from HARDI lead to high
sensitivity and speciï¬city in differentiating PD vs. control and others in literature have shown discrimina-
tion between different stages of AD using macro-structural features derived from T1-MRI. This motivates
us to combine micro- and macro-structural features via a multi-modality approach to differentiate DLB
vs. PD, AD and controls. Differentiating between DLB, PD and AD is challenging because of possible overlap
in clinical symptoms leading to misdiagnosis. Further, differentiating between them is of high signiï¬cance since
treatments including counseling for each are distinct. We propose a multi-modal approach that combines
the advantages of T1- and diffusion-MRI to achieve this goal. Recently, convolutional neural nets (CNNs)
have had great success in image classiï¬cation tasks in computer vision and medical imaging. CNNs however
can not cope with HARDI data in its native form, which are samples of functions deï¬ned on non-Euclidean
(curved) domains. This motivates us to develop a novel higher order CNN that is a parameter efï¬cient, inter-
pretable geometric deep learning network possessing improved model capacity, which we call the VolterraNet.
The VolterraNet will be designed for such data with the goal of facilitating the classiï¬cation of DLB, PD and AD
groups. Further, VolterraNet will automatically localize the regions in the brain that are signiï¬cantly discriminatory
of these patient groups. We will test the VolterraNet on HARDI scans acquired from a cohort of 356 Controls, 355
PD, 216 DLB and 240 AD scans obtained from a medley of data sites including the PDBP, 1Florida-ADRC and
PPMI. The VolterraNet will be validated using the standard leave-k-out cross-validation method with the precision
recall measure. The gold standard used will be the specialist-assigned clinical diagnosis from contributing stud-
ies (e.g. consensus assignment from ADRCs). The VolterraNet will have signiï¬cant beneï¬ts to the Neurology
community through better detection and diagnosis of several neurodegenerative disorders."
10720893,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) may be a risk factor for the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). US
military veterans have an increased frequency of ALS, and the veteran population has higher head injury
prevalence than the comparable civilian population. Repetitive head impacts (RHI) are a form of mild TBI that
can lead to severe cognitive and behavioral symptoms and the progressive neurodegeneration of chronic
traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). We have shown that ALS is a relatively frequent comorbidity in CTE (4) and
that CTE occurs in a veteran population with ALS. Furthermore, genomic variation in TMEM106B may play an
important role in both ALS and CTE disease progression. We hypothesize that TMEM106B is a modifier of
disease presentation and severity in ALS and that TBI and RHI alter the associations of TMEM106B with
pathology and clinical outcomes in CTE. Currently, there are no disease modifying treatments for ALS or CTE,
and little is known about genetic modifiers of disease phenotype in ALS or CTE. This is largely because there
has not been a systematic collection of participants with ALS, CTE, and both (ALS+CTE) until now. Our
translational approach is to systematically address neurodegeneration in the worldâs largest
neuropathologically-confirmed autopsy cohort of ALS and CTE subjects on the DNA, RNA, and protein levels,
with the goal of identifying novel genetic risk factors, biomarkers, and mechanisms that can be targeted for
drug discovery. We have shown that compared with ALS in isolation, comorbid ALS+CTE is associated with a
history of TBI and has a distinct clinical and pathological presentation. Furthermore, we have demonstrated
that variation in TMEM106B is associated with microglia activation, tau pathology, and clinical symptoms in
CTE. Variation in TMEM106B is also related to altered clinical outcomes in ALS, the development of
frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP), and to progranulin (PRGN) levels and
modulation of inflammatory pathways. Microglial activation is an early change in both ALS and CTE and may
alter disease progression. Our hypothesis, based on our preliminary data, is that variants of TMEM106B have
disease-specific associations with altered cytokines, pathology, and clinical disease progression in ALS and
CTE. We further hypothesize that TMEM106B variation is associated with altered gene expression networks
related to inflammatory pathways that predispose to worse pathological and clinical outcomes in ALS, CTE,
and ALS+CTE. Our long-term goal is to uncover genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying the
development of ALS and CTE in the setting of TBI. The immediate goal of this research project is to test the
hypothesis that the TMEM106B risk allele leads to altered inflammatory gene expression and to determine
TMEM106B-related disease modifying gene networks and neuroinflammatory markers that may serve as
biomarkers to identify those individuals at risk for developing ALS and CTE and to uncover mechanisms that
may be targeted for therapy. Overall, we aim to link a history of TBI to genetic, gene expression, and protein
variation in human subjects with a definitive pathological diagnosis of ALS, CTE, and ALS+CTE."
10765600,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Screening for
CRC with colonoscopy reduces incidence and mortality. The VA Cooperative Studies Program #380
âProspective Evaluation of Risk Factors for Colonic Adenomas (>1cm) in Asymptomatic Subjectsâ
was one of the first studies to demonstrate the safety of screening colonoscopy and highlight the
magnitude of benefit through the removal of precancerous polyps for the prevention of CRC.
However, there is considerable variability in individual risk of CRC that could impact age at initiation
of CRC screening, screening modality and frequency of follow-up. Yet, guidelines do not recognize
this variability, performing too much colonoscopy screening and surveillance in low risk individuals
and not providing enough or timely screening and surveillance in high-risk individuals. Genetic and
genomic data offer a promising strategy to improve CRC risk prediction and better target CRC
screening resources. However, what is missing in these genomic risk calculations is recognition of the
timing of certain genetic changes and of those changes in CRC precursors in a clinically meaningful
time course to predict the timing of future CRC. Longitudinal studies of CRC precursors and
progression, identification of genetic risk factors for progression, and incorporation into personalized
risk models can only be accomplished through development of an integrated data resource and
application of new statistical models. We have begun to develop the resources to allow the large-
scale analyses needed to develop comprehensive clinical and genetic risk models. This proposal is
built on our work CSP#380 which incorporates a longitudinal research program of 3121 Veterans who
underwent screening colonoscopy between 1994 and 1997 and have been followed for 20 years. We
have used the CSP#380 research database to apply emerging statistical models for longitudinal
cohorts that incorporate the clinical information from each colonoscopy, allowing estimates of
informative follow-up times while taking the competing risk of mortality over time into account. We
have also extended the biorepository for CSP#380 to include pathology specimens obtained at
colonoscopy to provide a longitudinal tissue resource. The goal of this proposal is to extend the
approach and models developed in CSP#380 to the VA Colonoscopy Cohort (VACC), which includes
all Veterans with exposure to colonoscopy in the VA. We will perform extensive testing in CSP#380
to provide estimates of data quality. This much larger VA data set will allow more thorough discovery
and testing of genetic factors in CRC risk models. This ambitious project will combine development
of a curated phenotype library with histopathology results generated from VA medical records with the
joint longitudinal models applied to CSP#380. We will begin to explore how to incorporate genetic
information into these models through pilot studies in CSP#380 with the future plan of applying these
models to additional VA datasets."
11145383,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Atypical and delayed oromotor development is a well-known clinical aspect of Down syndrome (DS) and
contributes to devastating challenges in speech, feeding, and swallowing. These challenges can affect the
majority of individuals with DS, with profound consequences for quality of life and health. The tongue and
brainstem are both complex systems that undergo rapid changes during early postnatal development and are
critical for speech and swallowing. However, the central and peripheral changes occurring in early childhood
that permit postnatal expansion in movement and function of the tongue are poorly understood in typical
development and in DS. Because early childhood is a time of rapid development during which the
neuromuscular system is plastic, altered tongue activity during this time may also alter the postnatal maturation
of the tongue neuromuscular system. However, the impact of altered lingual activity on intrinsic tongue and
brainstem maturation in early post-natal development has rarely been studied and is therefore unknown. We
hypothesize that DS is associated with developmental delays in maturation of the tongue neuromuscular
system. The proposed work is highly significant in using mouse models to advance understanding of a
developmental disorder in which atypical tongue function contributes to compromise of speech intelligibility and
health. Aim 1 will generate normative data for the study of tongue and brainstem maturation with reference to
three consecutive early postnatal ages and will determine how DS impacts lingual development. This will be
achieved through behavioral, immunofluorescence, and gene expression studies of tongue muscles and
brainstem in the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS in comparison to typical sibling controls. Aim 2 will determine
whether lingual activity levels after weaning impact maturation of the tongue neuromuscular system. This aim
will be achieved through analysis of tongue and brainstem before weaning and after 2 weeks of an ecologically
valid post-weaning condition in which all mice naturally refrain from licking due to a liquid consistency
modification. This aim will clarify the extent to which shifts in tongue activity imposed by environmental
modifications elicit changes in postnatal maturation of the tongue and brainstem in Ts65Dn mice and in typical
sibling controls. Collectively, these aims will further the science underlying both typical and delayed lingual
maturation. This work will also shed light on basic biological implications of feeding interventions used with
children with DS that alter oromotor activity. As such, this work will provide basic knowledge for future efforts to
develop biologically based approaches for successful resolution of pediatric oromotor disorders. These goals
will establish an experimental framework to advance biologically informed treatments for developmental
speech, feeding, and swallowing disorders."
10655276,"Abstract African Americans (AAs) are disproportionally affected by lung cancer, compared with all other racial
and ethnic groups in terms of incidence and survival. Disproportionate diagnosis of aggressive disease and poor
survival among AAs highlights the critical need for further studies that characterize racial differences in lung
cancer. Our goal is to address this vital knowledge gap by identifying molecular, biological, and social
characteristics (neighborhood-level factors) underlying the diseaseâs aggressiveness, thereby reducing the
disparity between African Americans (AAs) and European Americans (EAs). Our central hypothesis is that CC
chemokine receptor-6 (CCR6) and its only natural ligand CCL20 add to the racial difference in molecular footprint
and immune landscape, impacting racial disparity in lung cancer aggressiveness and prognosis. In addition to
these biological factors, social factors associated with chronic stress, which elevated cortisol, shape the
immunological landscape differently in AAs, contributing to racial differences in aggressiveness and prognosis.
There is a unique possibility that CCR6/CCL20 and social characteristics contribute to the disparity in lung cancer
among AAs, which has never been explored. Hence the proposed work will enhance understanding of cell
biological traits of aggressive lung cancers, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for
~85% of the lung cancers that underlie ethnic disparities in disease outcomes and mechanisms by which cells
acquire aggressive phenotypes. To accomplish these goals, we have assembled a multidisciplinary research
team with complementary expertise in cancer immuno-biology, oncology, pulmonary care, pathology, public
health/behavioral science, bioinformatics, and biostatistics to investigate the following aims: A1. Establish the
association of CCR6-CCL20 axis in NSCLC aggressiveness and therapeutic response among AAs and EAs;
A2. Ascertain the race-specific differences in the immunological landscape contributing to the NSCLC disparity
and A 3. Determine the impact of social stress on the immune signature among AA and EA NSCLC patients.
Completion of these aims will i) inform a rapid, non-invasive chemokine based detection methods which will
allow classifying potentially fatal lung cancers, ii) a method for early patient stratification so that risk-adapted
chemokine-based therapies can be designed to match patient subgroups with distinct CCR6 profiles, iii) to offer
more effective treatment approach, iv) a framework for improving the success rate of clinical trials involving
investigational drugs by establishing new criteria for patient classification, Immune-based strategies to reduce
disparity and, v) identify geospatial neighborhood characteristics impacting the immune system and outcome in
lung cancer aggressiveness and therapeutic outcome on which evidence-based intervention can be developed
to address the disparity in lung cancer."
10799708,"Hypertension is largely responsible for AAs living 5.5 fewer years than whites. Over half (55%) of AA adults
now have hypertension and 45% have uncontrolled blood pressure (BP). Improving BP control in AAs is critical
to improving health equity for AAs. A reduction of 10 mmHg in systolic BP is associated with 28% reduced risk
of heart failure, 27% risk reduction for stroke, 20% for major cardiovascular events, 17% for coronary heart
disease. Medication and diet change are the most effective strategies for reducing blood pressure, but
adherence to both is especially low in AAs. Low trust, cultural preference for unhealthy foods, and logistical
barriers due to poor access are underlying causes of poor adherence. Church-based interventions for
individuals with uncontrolled BP have potential to increase adherence among AAs because the church is a
trusted setting with strong social support. The proposed church-based intervention consists of a 9-month
group-based Basic intervention for all participants, supplemented by a 3-month individualized CHW
intervention for participants that do not achieve BP reduction milestones at 3 and 6 months. The Basic
intervention is a culturally-tailored, group-based BP education intervention that consists of two components: a
Bible study, led by the Pastor, to encourage a link between healthy lifestyle and spiritual values, and Behavior
Change small groups, led by a trained church member, to promote behavior change strategies (education,
goal-setting, self-monitoring, problem-solving). The CHW intervention consists of one-on-one meetings
between participants and a CHW twice per month for 3-months, focused on addressing individual barriers to
medication adherence and healthy diet. CHWs will also connect participants to community resources to
address barriers, as needed. We propose to conduct a 24-month behavioral cluster randomized controlled trial
in which 18 churches (n=342) are randomized to one of two arms. The intervention arm will receive the Alive
BP intervention in the first year and Money Smart, a financial education intervention, in the second year. The
comparator (control) arm will receive the two interventions in the reverse order. The primary aim is to compare
African American church members with uncontrolled BP in the intervention churches with those in the
comparator churches on mean change in systolic BP at 12 months. The secondary aim is to evaluate the effect
of the intervention on diet quality, medication adherence, self-efficacy, intrinsic motivation, social support,
knowledge, beliefs about medications, and barriers to medication use. An exploratory aim is to evaluate
sustainability of change in SBP at 24 months post-intervention in the intervention arm."

A fundamental goal of human genetics is to decipher the relationship between genotype and phenotype.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of common variants associated with
numerous traits and diseases; but for the vast majority of genetic associations the underlying functional
mechanisms are unknown. The key challenges in elucidating the biology underlying GWAS risk loci are: (i)
to identify the susceptibility gene(s) at risk loci and their functional role in disease pathogenesis; (ii) to identify
the causal risk variant(s) initiating disease development; and (iii) to establish the regulatory mechanisms by
which risk variant(s) affect target gene expression
An emerging feature of common variant risk loci is pleiotropy, where a risk locus shows evidence of
susceptibility to two or more phenotypes. Breast, prostate and ovarian cancers share common etiologies.
GWAS have so far identified more than 400 confirmed risk loci for these cancers. We have performed a meta-
analysis of breast, prostate and ovarian cancers identifying more than 100 novel pleiotropic risk regions that
suggest these cancers have a shared genetic component and similar underlying biology. Substantially larger
genotyping studies continue to be performed in the human population and for these cancers which will provide
the opportunity to identify additional breast, prostate and ovarian cancer pleiotropic risk loci. Our groups have
also developed functional assays, including chromosome conformation capture, CRISPR/Cas9 genome
editing, and experimental models of breast, prostate and ovarian cancer that enables us to establish the
underlying biology driving neoplastic development at these risk loci in these cancer types.
The overarching goals of this study are to identify shared genetic susceptibility alleles for breast, prostate and
ovarian (BPO) cancers driven by non-coding DNA variation, and to establish the shared functional
mechanisms that underlie disease risk for these cancers. The specific aims are: (1) To identify the credible
causal risk variants, regulatory targets and candidate genes at pleiotropic BPO risk loci; (2) To utilize functional
screening assays to prioritize causal risk variants, regulatory targets, and candidate genes at BPO risk loci; (3)
To determine causality for risk variants, candidate genes and regulatory elements at BPO risk loci."
10704162,"Air pollution and tuberculosis (TB) represent two of the most devastating and life-threatening global public health
problems. With hundreds of million persons living in urban slums worldwide, vulnerable, marginalized and hard-
to-reach populations are most affected by indoor and outdoor air pollution and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)
transmission. This project explores if and how air pollution fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure increases the
transmission of Mtb from TB index cases to their household contacts (HC) in a high TB incidence urban slum
area (Namuwongo) in Kampala/Uganda. We have previously shown that air pollution PM2.5 exposures suppress
essential, protective, Mtb-specific, human innate and adaptive host immune responses. A key unanswered
question of great significance to global TB control efforts is whether air pollution exposure increases the risk for
transmission of Mtb in vulnerable communities, both through increased infectiousness (of the TB index cases)
and susceptibility to Mtb infection (of their contacts). We hypothesize that inhalational exposure to PM2.5
increases the infectiousness of TB index cases by increasing their source strength i.e. the Mtb content in their
respiratory aerosols, and by triggering cough. We further hypothesize that PM2.5 exposure suppresses protective
immune responses leading to increased susceptibility to Mtb infection in the HC of the TB index cases. Both
would be expected to increase transmission of Mtb in the community. To address our hypotheses, we will
evaluate (1) the source strength of TB index cases and new Mtb infection in their HC (Mtb transmission) (SA1),
(2) personal air pollution (PM2.5) exposures (SA2) and (3) how personal air pollution (PM2.5) exposure is
associated with PM load in airway macrophages, source strength, and Mtb transmission to HC (SA3). To assess
the source strength of the TB index cases, we will quantify the Mtb load in their respiratory aerosols using a
novel face mask sampling approach. We will also determine TB index case cough frequencies with the Leicester
Cough Monitor, assess chest radiographs and time to culture positivity (MGIT culture). Transmission of Mtb from
TB index cases to HC will be ascertained by tuberculin skin test and QFN-Plus blood test between weeks 0 and
8. All measures combined reflect infectiousness of TB index cases. Exposure to PM2.5 of TB index cases and a
random sample of HC will be studied using multiple approaches: `gold standard' gravimetric (UPAS) and real-
time air monitoring between weeks 0 and 8, assessment of PM load in airway macrophages obtained by sputum
induction of TB index cases and in randomly selected as well as newly Mtb-infected HC, stationary household
PM2.5 and outdoor PM2.5 monitoring, and household study with questionnaires. Associations between TB index
case source strength, Mtb transmission and PM2.5 exposure will be sought using linear modeling, to identify both
main effects and modifying factors. Deciphering environmental factors that contribute to transmission of Mtb in
vulnerable urban populations will provide much needed data for mandated public health actions and improved
TB control approaches worldwide."

 The U.S. study to PrOtect brain health through lifestyle INTErvention to Reduce risk (U.S.
POINTER) is a $35M Alzheimer's Association-sponsored multisite randomized clinical trial
investigating the influence of a multidomain lifestyle intervention (exercise, diet, cognitive stimulation,
health coaching for risk factor reduction) on 2yr cognitive trajectories in older adults at increased risk
of dementia. POINTER was modeled after Finland's FINGER trial that showed a greater cognitive benefit for
those assigned to a multidomain lifestyle intervention group versus health education. POINTER will use a
similar two-group study design. The health education (âself-guidedâ) group will receive information and support
through twice yearly group meetings to encourage healthy lifestyle practices. The higher-intensity (âstructuredâ)
lifestyle intervention group will receive frequent coaching and group meetings to encourage aerobic exercise
and cognitive training 4 days/week, adherence to a modified Mediterranean diet, and cardiovascular risk
reduction through increased medical monitoring. Based on the successful FINGER results, the structured
group is predicted to show the greatest benefits on 2yr cognitive trajectories given the high intensity of the
intervention and the potential for synergistic effects across lifestyle domains.
 Lacking from the POINTER design, however, are neuroimaging measures to investigate
intervention effects on underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebrovascular pathophysiology.
This proposed imaging ancillary study leverages unique resources provided by the parent trial to examine
whether changes in lifestyle can protect brain health and alter AD trajectories. The study will assess these
intervention effects on changes in AD and cerebrovascular pathophysiology. It will also examine
whether these biomarkers at baseline predict cognitive response to the intervention, which has
important implications for precision medicine in identifying those most likely to benefit from this approach. AD
and cerebrovascular pathophysiology will be assessed with PET imaging (baseline, 2yrs) to measure beta-
amyloid and tau burden, and MR imaging (baseline, 1yr, 2yrs) to measure brain morphometry, white
matter hyperintensities and microstructural integrity, and cerebral blood flow.
 An in-depth analysis of lifestyle changes on disease biomarkers has significant implications for public
health given the current weight of evidence showing favorable effects of lifestyle on brain health in
older adults that overshadow the results of all other pharmacological treatments to date. Moreover,
lifestyle modification is an affordable and accessible approach with health benefits that extend beyond brain
health. A critical and clinically relevant feature of the POINTER trial is its recruitment approach which targets a
community-based and geographically and racially/ethnically diverse sample, ensuring that the
intervention will be applicable to a large proportion of older individuals."

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. While androgen ablation
therapy (ABT) is the mainstay of therapy for men with prostate cancer, most patients with prostate cancer will
inevitably develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which no longer responds to ABT treatment.
Thus, understanding of the mechanisms leading to CRPC and ABT resistance is urgently needed. Several
mechanisms account for the occurrence of CRPC, such as activation of 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway, which
plays a critical role in cell proliferation and cell survival, and higher expression of AR and AR splicing variants,
which facilitate prostate cancer cell survival under very low androgen concentrations. Of note is that prostate
cancer stem cells (PCSCs) also known as cancer initiating cells (CICs), which account for a small cell population
prostate cancer cells, are critically involved in the development of CRPC. But how PCSCs are regulated and
how they can be pharmacologically targeted are currently not well understood. While several stem cell factors
such as SOX2 playing an important role in maintaining PCSC pool and functions are identified, there is no
effective strategy to block the action of these proteins in order to eradicate PCSCs within the cancer. Thus,
identifying key druggable targets maintaining PCSCs could provide novel paradigms and effective strategies for
prostate cancer therapy and overcoming ABT resistance. Our goal in this study is to identify a novel mechanism
underlying PCSC maintenance, which could be harnessed to develop an effective strategy for CRPC targeting.
Using systematic metabolomics and transcriptomics in conjunction with biochemical validation and in vivo tumor
development assays, we unraveled a novel oncogenic and metabolic signaling pathway, which was elevated
during ABT treatment and in advanced human prostate cancer, is critical for maintaining the stemness and pool
of PCSCs and CRPC development. Of note, we observed aberrant AMPK activation and AMPK-dependent
mitochondria fission upon loss of this metabolic signaling, correlated with the defect in stemness and pool of
PCSCs and prostate cancer progression. In light of these findings, we hypothesized that this newly discovered
metabolic signaling is crucial for restricting aberrant AMPK-dependent mitochondrial fission to maintain the pool
and stemness of PCSCs, thereby leading to CRPC and ABT resistance. Our hypothesis has been formulated
based on our solid and innovative preliminary results. In this proposal, we proposed three specific aims to test
this paradigm-shift hypothesis. Our study has not only revolutionized and significantly advanced our
understanding of cancer metabolism in PCSC regulation, but also offered a promising strategy to treat advanced
prostate cancer and overcoming ABT resistance."
10758188,"Project Abstract/Summary
Aging is associated with decline in spatial navigation and episodic memory function. Theoretical models argue
that navigation and episodic memory are intricately linked â spatial contexts serve as scaffolds for episodic
memory, facilitating the encoding, organization, and retrieval of memories. One set of processes that could
contribute to both navigational and episodic memory impairments in aging is diminished attention; reduced
attentional control and diminished sustained attention in older adults could lead to poor spatial representation,
suboptimal navigational strategies, and subsequent declines in memory. The proposed research program will
leverage a series of virtual-reality (VR) spatial navigation paradigms, in combination with behavioral and neural
markers of attention, spatial coding, and memory to examine how attentional deficits in aging relate to navigation
and episodic memory difficulties. Aim 1 will use a VR spatial navigation task to examine how moment-to-moment
selective attention and sustained attention (assessed through eye-tracking and pupillometry) relate to spatial
navigation performance in older relative to young adults. Expt 1 will assess both age-related and individual
differences in (a) how attention relates to navigation performance, (b) the relative salience of types of spatial
cues (distal vs. proximal) that influence navigation strategies, and (c) how attention during initial environment
encoding affects the ability to calculate new spatial trajectories following changes in the environment. Aim 2 will
investigate how age-related differences in behavioral and neural markers of attention relate to differences in the
representation of spatial context and in context-mediated regulation of memory integration and interference. Expt
2 will examine how (a) behavioral measures of attention to spatial context relate to episodic memory, influencing
when two overlapping events are discriminated (pattern separation), diminishing interference, and when two
overlapping events are integrated, enabling novel inferences. Expt 3 will use fMRI to examine (a) age-related
differences in the function of neural systems of attention (e.g., frontoparietal cortical networks, locus coeruleus)
and episodic memory (e.g., medial temporal lobe) during spatial navigation and associative encoding, along with
concurrent pupillometry to (b) measure how trial-by-trial differences in behavioral markers of sustained attention
influence neural representations of spatial context and episodic memory and (c) investigate how age-related
differences in interactions between attentional and memory systems influence memory integration and
interference. Collectively, these studies will advance and link theories of attention, spatial navigation, and
memory to early cognitive, behavioral, and neural changes in aging, and promise to enable future study of how
attention, navigation, and memory interactions are affected by disease processes (e.g., Alzheimerâs disease)."

Sports-related concussion is a major public health concern. Many children participate in organized sports, thus
exposing them to potential brain injury at earlier ages. While impacts to the head in contact sports (CS) are
unavoidable and can cause serious consequence such as concussion, non-concussive repetitive head impacts
(RHI) happen much more often and are implicated as a source for the deterioration of cerebral structure and
function later in life. Emerging evidence suggests that effects of repetitive blows to the head are cumulative and
that RHI exposure during CS is connected to pathologically altered neurophysiology. Despite its high incidence,
the pathophysiology of brain injury due to repetitive subconcussive impacts remains elusive. The overarching
goal of this research is to combine state-of-art neuroimaging and biomechanical metrics to identify key
neurophysiological processes in young athletes associated with RHI exposure during routine CS. We will conduct
a longitudinal study to systematically characterize neuroimaging biomarkers of underlying neurophysiological
changes induced by RHI exposure during routine CS in young athletes. We will investigate two age groups
(middle school and high school) of CS players in comparison with closely matched non-contact sports (NCS)
players at two consecutive game and practice seasons. Each subject will be assessed four times: right before
and after each season. The biomechanical doe of RHI will be assessed using the impact monitoring mouthguard
system for CS players. This study is aimed to determine effects of RHI exposure on changes in brain structure
and function, the relationship between biomechanical dose of RHI and its effects on brain structure and function
in CS athletes, as well as age effects on non-concussive brain injury after exposure to RHI during routine CS
season. Findings from the proposed research will have important clinical significance, with the potential to
enhance the capacity to detect sports-related non-concussive injury due to RHI exposure, monitor its recovery,
and serve as a potential biomarker for response to treatment interventions in the future."

Stroke in small brain vessels in subcortical white matter (WM) regions account for 25% of all strokes. It leads to vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), and is the second leading cause of dementia overall. Despite such clinical importance, the pathophysiology of ischemic WM injury (WMI) and VCID is still poorly understood. Moreover, there is no yet an approved therapy for prevention and/or treatment of WM strokes and VCID. Here, we propose collaborative studies between the Zlokovic and Griffin labs on activated protein C (APC) pathways in the WM, and to evaluate therapeutic potential of APC-based therapies for ischemic WMI using a model of vasoconstriction of small brain vessels in the WM. Our previous studies using models of large artery infracts, brain trauma and neurodegeneration led to discovery of vasculoprotective, blood-brain barrier (BBB)-stabilizing, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory activities of APC and its cytoprotective-selective mutants. In 2019, these findings have been translated into successfully completed phase 2 trial for ischemic stroke of 3K3A-APC, a 2nd generation cytoprotective-selective APC analog with >90% loss of anticoagulant activity. However, whether activation of APC pathways in the WM is beneficial or not during ischemic WMI, remains unknown. Our goals include: 1) providing proof of concept for hypothesized mechanisms for protective activities of APC in the WM; and 2) characterizing novel protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1)-related P1-47 and PAR3-related P3-42 APC-mimetic peptides, and 3) testing improved 3rd generation APC R-46-selective biologics for treating and preventing ischemic WMI and WM stroke. Our pilot data support our hypotheses that: i) APC will be beneficial for ischemic WMI via PAR1 cleavage at Arg46 to protect WM fiber tracts, oligodendrocytes and BBB from ischemic WMI (AIM 1); ii) APC-mimetic peptides derived from PAR1 and PAR3 sequences (e.g,, P1-47 and P3-42, (i.e., the tethered PAR agonists created by APC cleavages) exhibit synergistic biased agonism, and will elicit ï¢-arrestin 2-dependent cytoprotective signaling in brain endothelium and oligodendrocytes in vitro and in vivo after WM stroke (AIM 2); and iii) E56K-APC and D180E-APC newly engineered APC mutants have enhanced ability to cleave PAR1 at Arg46 and will provide improved APC biologics for WM stroke therapy (AIM 3). To address our hypotheses, we will use i) WM model of stroke; ii) new mouse lines carrying R41Q-PAR1 and R46Q-PAR1 point mutations, and ï¢-arrestin 2-/- and Gï¡12-/- mice; iii) new APC-mimetic PAR1- and PAR3-related peptides with the respective PAR1 and PAR3 tethered-ligand amino acid sequences; iv) new APC R46-cleavage site selective biologics; v) in vivo mutiparametric longitudinal MRI of WM lesion volume, BBB integrity, blood flow, structural and connectivity changes, and tract-tracing based connectomics for circuit level analysis; vi) behavior tests; vii) immunohistology, neuropathology; and viii) oligodendrocyte cultures and in vitro BBB model. If successful, new knowledge generated from this project could translate to the clinic as new therapies for WM stroke and VCID."
10767327,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Fluorination of pharmaceutical compounds has been shown to increase their potency through 
modulation of their lipophilicity, acidity, and conformational bias. Photoredox decarboxylative 
fluorination in particular has been recognized as a powerful strategy for accessing fluorinated
compounds. However, these methods have typically been limited to cooperative catalysis with 
expensive Ir or organic photocatalysts. The Yoon lab has recently demonstrated a novel way to promote 
oxidative photochemical decarboxylation using simple CuII salts. Irradiation of the CuII carboxylate 
results in ligand-to-metal charge transfer, which leads to rapid decarboxylation to generate the alkyl 
radical. They applied this strategy towards the decarboxylative amination of benzylic carboxylic acids.
 This proposal details the application of this strategy towards oxidative decarboxylative fluorination 
and investigation of the reaction mechanism of this approach. In the first Aim, the photochemical 
oxidative decarboxylative fluorination of alkyl carboxylic acids will be developed using stoichiometric 
copper as both the terminal oxidant and decarboxylating agent. Both radical abstraction and 
nucleophilic fluorination mechanisms will be probed. The second Aim focuses on the development of a 
copper-catalyzed photochemical decarboxylative fluorination using Selectfluor as a source of fluorine 
and as an oxidant to turn over the catalyst. Use of catalytic copper allows for tuning of light absorption 
and copper complexation through ligand choice. UV-Vis will be used to identify ligands that form copper 
complexes that absorb light in the visible region and are stable in the presence of excess carboxylate. 
The reaction mechanism will be interrogated through quantum yield studies. Finally, upon development 
of the stoichiometric and catalytic methods, the mechanism and identity of the active copper species in 
solution will be investigated through UV-Vis, EPR, and computational studies as part of the third Aim.
 Development of this strategy provides a complementary approach to existing methods for the 
incorporation of fluorine in small molecules using simple, inexpensive reagents and affords mechanistic 
insight into a novel method for photochemical oxidative decarboxylation."

HIV infects macrophages in the spinal cord and brain, often leading to clinical symptoms even with
antiretroviral treatment (ART). In spinal cord and brain, macrophages (MÎ¦s) may serve as long-term cellular
reservoirs of latent HIV. Replication competent HIV can emerge from these latent reservoirs if ART is stopped.
SIV replicates in both spinal cord and brain at equivalent levels during acute infection; however, the specific
cellular targets of SIV in the CNS have not been classified throughout infection, including during latency and
rebound after interrupting ART. In contrast with acute infection, viral dynamics are significantly different in
these distinct CNS compartments after stopping ART and tracking SIV rebound. SIV RNA is readily detectable
in spinal cord in the first weeks after stopping ART; in contrast, most SIV-infected animals do not have
detectable SIV RNA in the brain. The disparity in rebound replication between spinal cord and brain may result
from unique cellular immune responses by MÎ¦ and astrocytes in these distinct CNS compartments. Most SIV-
infected macaques receiving ART have no detectable SIV RNA in spinal cord or brain, CSF, or plasma.
Proviral DNA and immune responses persist nonetheless in both spinal cord and brain. Intriguingly, the nature
of the sustained immune response differs: in the spinal cord, elevated expression of both GFAP and CCL2
point to sustained astrocyte activation; in the brain, elevated CD68 and TNFÎ± levels indicate persistent brain
MÎ¦ activation. The central premise of this proposal is that spinal cord MÎ¦s serve as a distinct SIV reservoir in
the CNS that reactivates rapidly after stopping ART. Cellular neuroimmune responses in the spinal cord differ
from the brain during latency and reactivation after stopping ART. In particular, coordinate regulation of spinal
cord MÎ¦ and astrocyte immune responses intrinsically differ from brain responses. Specific Aim 1 is to
determine whether spinal cord MÎ¦s constitute a unique SIV reservoir in the CNS by identifying SIV-infected
CNS cell populations during 1) acute SIV infection, 2) prolonged latency with ART, and 3) viral rebound after
stopping ART. Specific Aim 2 will identify the neuroinflammatory responses in the spinal cord and brain during
1) acute SIV infection, 2) prolonged latency on ART, and 3) viral rebound after stopping ART. Gene expression
profiling will be performed using nCounter immunoregulatory assays; single cell RNA-seq gene expression
profiling performed on single cells isolated from spinal cord and brain including MÎ¦s and astrocytes will
complement targeted gene profiling. Specific Aim 3 is to determine whether depleting spinal cord and brain
MÎ¦s during latency and continuing after stopping ART by treatment with the CSF1R inhibitor PLX3397 alters
CNS SIV replication during SIV rebound from latency. MÎ¦ depletion will complement SA1 studies on CNS
MÎ¦s as latent reservoirs and SA2 studies on spinal cord gene expression profiles in latency and during SIV
rebound to advance our understanding of the role that spinal cord MÎ¦s play in HIV latency."
10812300,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal for an NRSA Individual Fellowship is centered on two principal goals: 1) afford the candidate the
necessary time and resources required to develop into an independent physician-scientist, and 2) investigate
the mechanisms governing the stability of induced regulatory T cells (iTregs) in experimental influenza viral
pneumonia. The candidate and his mentors have outlined a comprehensive and progressive research plan to
achieve these objectives while laying the foundation for a successful, independent research career. Despite
decades of clinical experience and research, severe viral pneumonia and ARDS remain a leading cause of
morbidity and mortality worldwide. Regulatory T-cells are a subset of CD4+ T-cells critical to maintaining immune
homeostasis and coordinating lung tissue repair after injury. Tregs require stable expression of the Foxp3
transcription factor. Stable, long-lived FoxP3+ Tregs that originate from the thymus are referred to as natural
Tregs (nTregs). In vitro, TGF-Î² induces transient Foxp3 expression and imparts temporary suppressive function
to naÃ¯ve CD4+ T-cells, generating cells defined as iTregs. The inherent instability of iTreg phenotype and function
poses a concern for their clinical use as a cellular therapy, as reversion to a CD4+ effector T-cell phenotype
promotes inflammation. The stability of Treg-specific transcriptional programs is known to be regulated by DNA
methylation, a process mediated by DNA methyltransferases and their adapter protein, UHRF1. iTregs
generated from UHRF1-null naÃ¯ve CD4+ T-cells possess enhanced suppressive function. Hence, we
hypothesize that UHRF1 expression in iTregs destabilizes acquired suppressive and reparative
transcriptional programs, leading to loss of pro-recovery function following viral pneumonia. The long-
term hope of this proposal is to identify determinants of maintenance of transcriptional and functional stability in
iTregs and provide validation for their use as cellular therapy in patients suffering from viral pneumonia-induced
ARDS.
In Specific Aim 1, we will determine whether UHRF1 is necessary to destabilize iTreg suppressive and reparative
transcriptional programs both in vitro and in vivo via tandem RNA-seq and DNA methylation analysis. In Specific
Aim 2, we will determine whether loss of UHRF1 in iTregs is sufficient to promote recovery following viral
pneumonia. We will use cutting-edge techniques for adoptive cell transfer, severity assessment of lung injury,
tamoxifen-based inducible systems in mice, flow cytometry, transcriptional profiling with RNA-sequencing, and
DNA methylation profiling with modified reduced representation bisulfite sequencing as the primary methods to
support the experimental design of this proposal."
10756119,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Leukemia patients bearing MLL1 rearrangement generally display very poor prognosis, demanding new
treatment strategies. Multiple independent studies have identified EZH2, a histone methyltransferase and
catalytic subunit of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), as an attractive drug target in MLL1-rearranged
leukemias. However, the current catalytic inhibitors of EZH2 have limited anti-tumor effect. Our preliminary
studies show that EZH2 also binds c-MYC and has a non-canonical function in activation of oncogenes (such
as Cyclin E1) in MLL1-rearranged leukemias, which differs from the well-known PRC2:EZH2-driven canonical
function related to gene repression. In order to target both canonical and non-canonical oncogenic actions by
EZH2, we used the Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology to generate novel EZH2 small-
molecule degraders including MS177. Our extensive preliminary studies have demonstrated that MS177
effectively degrades both PRC2:EZH2 and non-PRC2 partners of EZH2 (e.g., c-MYC, which binds EZH2 to
activate oncogenes), thus suppressing both canonical and non-canonical oncogenic activities of EZH2 in
tumor. Importantly, our preliminary results also show that MS177 is superior to all of enzymatic inhibitors of
EZH2 in treating MLL1-rearranged leukemias. Thus, we hypothesize that: (1) EZH2 has a less-studied, non-
canonical oncogenic function, which acts in parallel with the PRC2:EZH2-dependent one to produce more
aggressive tumor phenotypes seen in MLL1-rearranged leukemias; and (2) targeting both canonical and non-
canonical activities of EZH2 by PROTACs represents a novel and superior therapeutic strategy to inhibition of
EZH2âs enzymatic activity alone. Dissection of the mechanisms underlying EZH2-mediated oncogenesis and
development of an optimal EZH2 PROTAC as a drug candidate will have significant impact on improving
treatments for MLL1-rearranged leukemia patients. Towards this goal, we will further characterize such a new
non-canonical oncogenic role of EZH2 in MLL1-rearranged leukemias (Aim 1a) and define effects of EZH2
PROTACs on suppressing both canonical and non-canonical oncogenic activities of EZH2 (Aim 1b). We will
also determine in vitro and vivo therapeutic effects of EZH2 PROTACs by employing multiple independent
MLL1-rearranged leukemia models including human/murine cancer cells and patient-derived xenografts (PDX)
(Aim 2). Lastly, we will optimize our EZH2 PROTAC leads into a drug candidate (Aim 3). Completion of the
proposed research will not only provide novel mechanistic understanding of how MLL1-rearranged leukemias
develop, but will also validate an innovative therapeutic strategy and deliver a promising therapeutic candidate
for the treatment of affected cancer patients."

 Perceiving multisensory information and responding with appropriate, real-time behaviors is critical for
normal communication and interaction with the environment. Past studies have investigated general brain
regions as well as specific cells that fire in response to more than one type of sensory cue, yet have not
pinpointed their presynaptic unimodal partners (inputs), meaning that the studied cells may have not been the
direct points of multisensory convergence. Additionally, these neurons themselves did not then drive
responsive and innate motor behavior. This has left gaps in understanding (1) how multisensory neurons
acquire their multi-modal feature detection properties directly from unimodal inputs at the cellular and circuit
levels, (2) how they integrate multimodal signals over time, and (3) how they then transform those signals into
dynamic motor responses, all during ethologically relevant and innate interactions.
 Neural circuits that govern Drosophila melanogaster courtship serve as a well-developed model for
sensory processing and real-time behavioral responses: during fly courtship, males sing to females, and
females perceive and respond to song, which in turn alters malesâ own courting behavior. This forms a complex
âconversationâ that emulates properties of many animalsâ social interactions. Within the courtship circuit, I have
discovered two direct unisensory convergence points onto multicellular cells and circuits, which have
themselves been shown to be necessary and sufficient to drive and modulate robust, measurable, and innate
behavior in Drosophila females, providing an unprecedented opportunity to address the gaps described above.
The convergence points were identified via analysis of novel whole-brain and half-brain electron microscopy
datasets at synaptic resolution.
 This proposal will directly elucidate principles of multisensory integration at the cellular, circuit,
and behavioral levels. Through high resolution behavioral tracking assays, Aim 1 will determine how, by
integrating natural combinations of audiovisual information, two multisensory neurons drive an ethologically
relevant behavior in Drosophila females. Aim 2 will determine, using calcium imaging in behaving flies in a
courtship virtual reality, how those neurons integrate auditory and visual signals from three of their unisensory
inputs. Taken together, this study will significantly expand understanding of how brain cells and circuits process
multisensory signals and transform them into dynamic motor responses, contributing to a foundation for
long-term understanding of normal and disordered sensorimotor function. Additionally, this scientific proposal,
along with the outstanding training environment in the Murthy lab and at the joint MD/PhD program at
Princeton and Rutgers, will provide exceptional foundational training in preparation for my career as an
independent physician scientist with my own laboratory."
10750935,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Modern neuroscience faces the challenge of bridging our understanding of single cell activity patterns to large
population dynamics. Brain oscillations evoked by sensory stimuli are fluctuations in field potentials reflecting
the combined activity of neural populations driven by a given stimulus. Oscillations have been observed in
many species from invertebrates to primates, and have been implicated in various processes like attention and
perceptual gating. Barn owls are specialists in sound localization studied for several decades. Their well-
described midbrain stimulus selection network, a circuit dedicated to localizing salient sounds, provides a
unique opportunity to evaluate the role of brain oscillations in coding. Previous in vivo recordings in the owlâs
optic tectum (OT), homolog of the mammalian superior colliculus, have shown that gamma oscillations (25-140
Hz) are tuned to both visual and auditory space. However, previous recordings in deep midbrain structures,
like OT, have relied on single electrodes and light tranquilization. These technical limitations impede our
understanding of how oscillations may spread across the space map at a given time, and underscores the
question of generalizability to awake processes like attention and perception. Our lab has pioneered population
recordings across the space map using multielectrode arrays, and has recently developed chronic microdrive
implants for recordings in awake owls. With these technical achievements, we will address several open
questions regarding the role of oscillations in perception of salient stimuli and stimulus selection. Aim 1 will
evaluate the spatial extent of gamma oscillations, and determine whether oscillations organize spike patterning
to preferred phases. Initial analyses show that sound stimulation with the preferred direction increases power
within the gamma range in a focal manner, supporting the hypothesis that spike patterning driven by brain
oscillations has a role in coding sound location. Aim 2 will compare oscillation properties across awake and
anesthetized states. Preliminary data and analysis suggest that while gamma power is higher in the awake
state, phase locking of spikes to gamma oscillations is consistent across states, suggesting significant
functional effects of gamma oscillations in organizing spike patterning are preserved during anesthesia. In Aim
3, we will conduct simultaneous recordings in the auditory thalamus and OT in awake behaving owls to test the
hypothesis that gamma oscillations play a role in perception of salient sounds and stimulus selection. We will
pair sound orienting behaviors, such as head turning and pupillary dilation responses, with electrophysiology to
elucidate the coding mechanisms underlying interregional signaling during perception. Understanding how the
owlâs midbrain stimulus selection circuit utilizes oscillations to conduct bottom-up relay and stimulus selection
can provide insight to similar processes in human audition where the most relevant auditory stream must be
prioritized in circumstances when the auditory scene is complex (cocktail party effect), and may inform novel
optimization strategies for hearing aids."

Tauopathies are a group of heterogeneous neurodegenerative diseases characterized by pathological
aggregation of tau protein in the brain. The most common primary tauopathy, progressive supranuclear palsy
(PSP), is identified clinically by progressive parkinsonism with supranuclear gaze paralysis, cognitive
dysfunction, behavioral changes, and other neurological deficits. Neuropathologically, PSP has a constellation
of features including morphologically distinct tufted astrocytes (TA). Astrocytes normally do not contain significant
levels of tau suggesting that TA play an important, but unknown, pathological role in PSP. The majority of PSP
cases are sporadic. Genome wide association studies have identified common variants associated with PSP risk
in EIF2AK3, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor critical for the unfolded protein
response (UPR). There is evidence for a pathogenic association between ER stress in astrocytes and tau
accumulation in PSP, but to test candidate molecular mechanisms there is a critical need for a model system
that recapitulates the cellular environment of the human brain and retains the genetic complexity of human
disease. Developing human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived models generated from PSP patients
will be a powerful tool to characterize molecular drivers of sporadic tauopathy. We hypothesize that UPR
activation in astrocytes drives neurodegeneration and plays a key role in sporadic PSP. In our first aim, we will
correlate UPR activation with astrocyte pathology and degeneration in human post-mortem brain tissue.
Autopsy-confirmed PSP brain tissue from our large collection will be stained, imaged, and analyzed for p-tau
distribution and UPR colocalization using innovative quantitative approaches. In the second aim, we will test the
hypothesis that PSP neurons and astrocytes are highly vulnerable to tau pathology, and that UPR activation in
PSP astrocytes increases cell vulnerability. To accomplish this aim, we will create patient iPSC-derived
monolayer neurons and astrocytes and directly measure molecular changes and cell vulnerability by
pharmacological manipulation of the UPR. Lastly, we will determine the extent to which UPR activation in
astrocytes increases the production of toxic tau species and cell vulnerability in an iPSC-derived organoid model
of sporadic PSP. This aim will explore molecular perturbations in different cell populations that contribute to the
development of tau pathology in a 3-D cellular environment that recapitulates the complex neuronal-astrocyte
interactions that occur in human brain tissue. These findings will be validated in paired autopsy brain tissue from
the same donor. In summary, the clinical-translational research performed in this study will generate patient-
derived iPSC models that retain a disease-relevant genomic background and reveal candidate pathways that
are disrupted early in sporadic PSP."
10838359,"Neurotrauma, including traumatic brain injury (TBI) and/or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), is highly
prevalent among US Veterans returning from military deployment, approximating upwards of 10-20% from
recent conflicts in the Middle East. In addition to a myriad of disabling daytime symptoms, we and others have
shown that neurotrauma is strongly associated with persistent and profound sleep disruption, in some cases
lasting for decades. In particular, emerging evidence suggests that neurotrauma may disrupt normal inhibition
of muscle tone during sleep. During rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, widespread paralysis of skeletal
muscles normally occurs â a process that is dysregulated in REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD),
characterized by violent dream enactment during REM sleep. We recently reported that RBD is increased by
over two-fold in Veterans with comorbid TBI+PTSD, compared to Veterans without neurotrauma. The
abnormal REM Sleep Without Atonia (RSWA) seen in patients with RBD is widely regarded as one of the
earliest clinical manifestations of synucleinopathy, since 50-70% of patients with RBD eventually phenoconvert
to Parkinson's Disease (PD) or related disorder. Emerging evidence from several epidemiological studies,
including our own, have suggested that both TBI and PTSD synergize to increase risk of later development of
PD. However, major gaps in our understanding remain. We still need to better understand the predictors and
neural pathways by which neurotrauma leads to RBD and synucleinopathy among susceptible individuals, and
we need to identify candidate therapies and windows for potential neuroprotective interventions in order to
prevent phenoconversion. These gaps will be addressed in 3 aims. Aim 1 will determine the behavioral
correlates of RSWA using a mouse model of combined TBI+PTSD. Using our previously established model of
combined TBI+PTSD, mice will undergo controlled cortical impact and single prolonged stress procedures,
followed by gait analysis, fear conditioning, and sleep electroencephalographic (EEG)/ electromyographic
(EMG) recordings to quantify RSWA. Mice will then be segregated into 3 groups on the basis of trauma
exposure and behavioral severity: Neurotrauma (NT), Trauma-Exposed (TE - behaviorally normal), and
Controls (not exposed to trauma). In Aim 1, we hypothesize that mice in the NT group will show increased
RSWA compared to TE and Controls, and the severity of behavioral symptoms will predict the degree of
RSWA within the NT group. In Aim 2, we will determine brain functional connectivity underlying RSWA and
behavioral deficits in mice with TBI+PTSD by using an innovative new method to image cerebral blood flow in
live animals with functional ultrafast ultrasound (fUS). We hypothesize that mice in the NT group will show
increased functional connectivity within the amygdala that will correlate with readouts of both behavior and
RSWA. In Aim 3, we will determine how neurotrauma contributes to RSWA and synuclein dynamics in the
SynGFP transgenic mouse, and test the ability of curcumin to slow this process. We will use the A53T SynGFP
mouse, an established mouse model of accelerated synucleinopathy that closely mimics the human condition,
in combination with our methods for TBI+PTSD and sleep recordings. We hypothesize that neurotrauma will
accelerate alpha-synuclein deposition, and that curcumin will decrease alpha-synuclein burden and ameliorate
behavioral deficits among NT mice. Results from these studies will provide valuable mechanistic information
about the pathophysiology underlying neurotrauma's effects on REM sleep and synucleinopathy, as well as
test a potentially promising treatment intervention. With this critical knowledge, we will take important steps
forward in better predicting and mitigating potential neurodegeneration among Veterans with TBI/PTSD."

Although obesity is a serious threat to the nationâs health, little progress has been made in its prevention. Infancy
may be an opportune time to prevent its development since the sooner the trajectory towards obesity is halted,
the less likely that negative health consequences will arise. Altered early gut bacterial communities may influence
offspring obesity through the metabolites they produce. Our overarching working causal model is that pre-, peri-
and postnatal exposures alter the microbes that colonize the infantâs gastrointestinal tract, which in turn alters
the gastrointestinal metabolites available to the infant host thereby programming that infant for a lifetime of
increased energy harvest and adipose deposition. Our preliminary data show that maternal BMI is associated
with the infant gut microbiota composition at age 1 month, and that the infant gut microbiota composition and
function at 1 month of age is associated with child obesity status at age 2 years, however we have limited
knowledge on how these factors may causally influence child growth. Although maternal BMI is a strong
determinant of child BMI, not all women with pre-pregnancy obesity will have children that will go on to develop
obesity; the converse is true for women who enter pregnancy at normal weight. Different biological mechanisms
may be important in the etiology of obesity dependent on prenatal environment. Thus, our overall hypothesis will
be tested in a sample stratified by maternal pre-pregnancy BMI category. Our Aims will be completed using two
currently established and continually enrolling prospective pregnancy and birth cohorts in Michigan. We expect
to enroll 300 dyads from each cohort (600 total) with 200 dyads falling into each of three pre-pregnancy BMI
categories (normal weight, overweight and obese; pre-pregnancy underweight is uncommon in Michigan and
will not be included). We will obtain data on maternal cardiometabolic health in the pregnancy (blood glucose,
blood pressure levels), which may help to differentiate women with a more âpathogenicâ body habitus. Prenatal
urinary metabolites will be measured to further phenotype the metabolic state. Antimicrobial exposures,
assessed by antimicrobial resistance gene abundance, using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and
bioinformatics methods, as well as medical record abstraction, will be measured. Additionally, stool metabolites
will be assessed prenatally and postnatally to determine transmissible functional aspects of the gut microbiota
within each pre-pregnancy BMI strata. The children will undergo body size assessment at ages 1, 2 and 3 years.
The research proposed herein will be the first step in a continuum of studies that will generate an important multi-
dimensional â-omicsâ dataset which will identify microbes, metabolites, and pathways which may lead to obesity
in later life. These can be targeted with future interventions to reduce the burden of obesity. Our proposal has
the capacity to provide evidence and solutions which could allow public health officials to target members of
each BMI sub-group with specific recommendations based on the unique microbial and metabolomic interactions
that our results reveal."
10668225,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by deficits in social
interaction, repetitive behaviors and atypical sensory processing. The change in quality of life in ASD individuals
is primarily attributed to social deficits, which can be associated with (or even triggered by) atypical processing
of sensory information. In particular, social touch deficits in ASD may explain this association given the strong
relationship between social interaction deficits and tactile hypersensitivity in ASD. Early tactile hyperresponsivity
predicts future social impairments in ASD children and the absence of touch prevents ASD children from forming
social relationships as adults. ASD individuals also lack representations of affective social touch in
somatosensory brain regions. In mouse models of ASD, tactile sensitivity and social touch interactions also
appear to be linked. Still, several important questions about social touch remain unresolved. First, it is not known
when social touch behavioral deficits first emerge in ASD. These deficits may emerge early on in development
when sensory hypersensitivity first develops or later in adolescence when social experiences become more
frequent. Second, little is known about how social touch and maladaptive behaviors to social touch are
represented in the brain of ASD individuals. Relevant brain areas may include the primary somatosensory cortex
(S1), which encodes social touch and shows impaired adaptation to innocuous tactile stimuli in ASD mouse
models, and the basolateral amygdala (BLA), which is important for encoding aversive stimuli and salient social
information. To investigate social touch deficits in mouse models of autism, I have designed a novel head-fixed
behavioral assay during which behavioral responses to social touch can be measured. This assay allows me to
spatially and temporally control social touch interactions between mice so that I can assess the behavioral
responses to both voluntary (whisker-whisker contact) and forced (snout-snout contact) social touch in a test
mouse as it interacts with a stranger mouse. My preliminary data already shows that both the Fragile X Syndrome
and maternal immune activation mouse models of autism animals display increased avoidance behaviors and
aversive facial expressions (AFEs) to both voluntary and forced social touch compared to their controls in
adulthood. Furthermore, these maladaptive behaviors are more prominent during social touch than object touch.
For this proposal, I will utilize this novel behavioral assay and in vivo silicon probe electrophysiology recordings
(Neuropixels) to 1. investigate when avoidance behaviors and AFEs to social touch emerge during development
(postnatal and juvenile ages) in ASD mice and 2. determine how social touch and the maladaptive behavioral
responses it triggers in ASD are represented as neural dynamics in S1 and BLA. This proposal is significant
because it will provide the first characterization of behavioral manifestations of social touch deficits across
development and investigate the neural circuit disruptions underlying these deficits in mouse models of ASD."

Radical species play important roles in biological systems linked not only to dysfunctional cell proliferation and
other disease pathways, but also in essential healthy processes necessary for life. Understanding the reactivity
profiles of open-shell carbon, oxygen, sulfur, and other heteroatomic-centered radical intermediates is crucial to
understanding how these processes occur and to propose reasonable mechanisms for currently ill-defined
pathways.
Studying and understanding reactivity profiles of radical intermediates can also result in the development of new
synthetic methodologies with the potential to streamline and make the synthesis of existing pharmaceuticals
more efficient and provide access to the next generation of therapeutics and tools for imaging, diagnosis,
treatment, and prevention.
This proposal is built on the prior and concurrent efforts of the PIâs research group using phosphorous-based
reagents to unmask carbon and heteroatom-centered radicals from untraditional precursors. This general
platform has achieved the regioselective construction of C-N bonds which are present in a substantial portion of
FDA approve pharmaceuticals and are often involved in the mode of biological activity. These radical-mediated
approaches leverage the favorable thermodynamics of atom-transfer processes to achieve new bond formations
from common chemical functionalities. Future studies will continue to explore the potential of this general
platform by investigating the ability of other common functional groups to be analogously unmasked to achieve
new bond formations. We anticipate that this work may lead to new strategies in complex molecule construction
for use in the preparation of new molecular therapeutics and tools in chemical biology."

National Institute of Aging MSTEM: Advancing Diversity in Aging Research (ADAR)
Undergraduate Education program to increase the number of highly qualified underrepresented
racial and ethnic minority students, students with disabilities, and disadvantaged students who
enter Ph.D. programs focused on aging research. Consistent with the NIA program
announcement, the SDSU ADAR program provides: 1) 3 years of structured research
experiences with outstanding mentors; 2) tailored learning opportunities; 3) an emphasis on the
relevance of aging and of the science of aging to the scholarsâ lives; and 4) activities to engage
students to develop a cadre of graduates who will go on to research careers that will diversify the
research workforce on aging. The SDSU ADAR program has three unique features. One is that
SDSU benefits from a partnership between SDSU and the University of California, San Diego
(UCSD). The partnership has a long history of highly successful joint doctoral programs, training
grants, and research collaborations. In addition, partnering with UCSD provides ADAR scholars
with research opportunities available through its medical school. A second unique feature of the
SDSU ADAR program is an extramural research experience at leading research institutions that
all scholars complete during their second summer. This transformative experience provides the
scholars many benefits, including becoming part of a research group at what often is the scholarâs
first extended journey away from home. The third unique feature of the SDSU ADAR program
is a seminar series entitled Becoming a Culturally Competent Alzheimerâs Disease
Researcher, which is an innovative two-semester sequence intended to (1) build scholarsâ
knowledge about Alzheimerâs disease and determinants of disparities in Alzheimerâs disease, (2)
prepare scholars to apply effective research skills in their research with diverse populations
affected by Alzheimerâs disease, and (3) increase scholarâs resilience for success in doctoral
programs and research careers. SDSU has a wealth of eligible and motivated students. The
SDSU ADAR PI has more than 20 years of experience in developing and leading successful
training programs, and the program benefits from dedicated and nationally recognized research
mentors who have made major contributions to the field of aging research. During the current
funding period, the SDSU ADAR program has been extremely successful, as evidenced by
92% of the four graduating cohorts entering excellent graduate programs in the field of aging.
With these attributes and a training program that has successfully placed ADAR scholars into top-
notch Ph.D. programs, the SDSU ADAR program is well positioned to continue to meet the goals
of the National Institute of Aging MSTEM: Advancing Diversity in Aging Research (ADAR)
Undergraduate Education program."
10663849,"Impacts: The proposed research addresses a critical VHA and HSR&D priority to improve access to opioid
use disorder (OUD) treatment by developing and pilot testing a novel telehealth treatment delivery intervention.
Background: With the national opioid epidemic, OUD prevalence in Veterans has increased and many
Veterans with OUD experience serious and preventable harms including overdose and suicide. Increasing
access to treatment, especially with the medication buprenorphine, can help prevent these harms. However,
only a third of Veterans with OUD receive evidence-based treatment. The biggest access barrier is lack of
trained buprenorphine providers on-site across VHA facilities, contributing to particularly low treatment for
Veterans receiving care in Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). Telehealth interventions have been
developed in the VA to allow specialists in VA Medical Centers to deliver treatment to Veterans in CBOCs, but
minimal research has been done on telehealth for substance use disorders. A few VA facilities, including the
VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System have begun to use telehealth to deliver OUD treatment, but research is
needed to inform a telehealth model that can be scalable across facilities, examine impact on treatment use,
and determine where telehealth should be targeted to maximize impact. The methods and sequence have
been designed to address these pressing questions in the following 3 aims:
Aim 1: Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with patients and clinicians in four facilities, including the
VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, that have begun to use telehealth delivery of OUD treatment to Veterans in
CBOCs, to understand components of their interventions, perceptions of treatment and barriers and facilitators
to use. Informed by these qualitative findings, a Delphi panel of OUD experts, including frontline providers, will
help refine a telehealth intervention that can be feasible across facilities and will be pilot tested in Aim 2.
Aim 2: In a pilot trial, CBOC Veterans with OUD will be randomized to the telehealth OUD intervention refined
in Aim 1 (n=20) or in-person OUD treatment as usual (n=20). The study will examine feasibility and
acceptability incorporating survey data and qualitative interviews with participants and study clinicians and
characterize treatment engagement, retention and substance-use outcomes over 3 month followup.
Aim 3: Using national VHA data of CBOC Veterans with OUD, analyses will examine factors associated with
patient and facility-level variation in OUD treatment to understand areas where treatment is need. Analyses will
also examine facility level variation in buprenorphine provider capacity and telehealth use. These findings will
identify key patient and facility-level factors associated with treatment need and indicate which patients and
CBOCs should be prioritized for telehealth.
Candidate: The PI's long-term goal is to build on her addiction clinical and research background to become a
leading VA health services researcher developing and evaluating interventions to improve treatment and
outcomes for Veterans with OUD and other substance use disorders. The PI will gain training in: 1) mixed
methods, 2) randomized intervention trials, 3) implementation science and 4) multi-level modeling. With a
stellar mentorship team and key operational partners, the research and training in this CDA will allow her to
launch a long trajectory of research developing and evaluating effective and accessible interventions to
improve outcomes for Veterans with OUD and other substance use disorders."

Our current Program has advanced the science of risk-based screening and surveillance by: (1) identifying clinical risk factors most predictive of invasive breast cancer for the general population and for racial and ethnic groups; (2) defining and evaluating advanced cancer as a screening outcome; (3) assessing new screening technologies and their use in underserved populations; (4) identifying multilevel factors that influence womenâs views of risk-based screening; and (5) identifying breast cancer survivors at high risk of an interval second breast cancer. During the next funding period, we propose three complementary Projects supported by three Cores. Project 1 aims to develop equitable advanced breast cancer risk models that incorporate imaging features, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, and clinical factors; and compare the benefits and harms of targeted screening frequency and supplemental MRI based on advanced cancer risk. Project 2 takes a multilevel approach to identify woman-, neighborhood-, and facility-level factors that drive inequities in breast cancer screening performance and outcomes, and to explore whether targeted AI use and other interventions can improve population outcomes with attention to health equity. Project 3 focuses on improving surveillance imaging in breast cancer survivors through equitably predicting women at high risk of a surveillance failure (i.e., interval 2nd breast cancer), improving surveillance performance through AI, and examining social determinants of health as multilevel drivers of surveillance failures and targets for future interventions.

10614414,"SUMMARY
 HIV infected patients have twice the risk of cardiovascular disease relative to the general population. The
main drivers of cardiovascular events in patients with HIV infection are associated with chronic immune
activation, systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. The molecular pathways linking HIV-driven
chronic T immune activation, vascular inflammation and increased risk of cardiovascular disease are largely
unknown. In this proposal, we will investigate the underlying mechanisms driving vascular
inflammation/damage during HIV infection by focusing in the function of angiogenic CD8 T cells (CD8 Tangs).
Under physiological conditions, Tang cells play a role in endothelial repair by promoting differentiation and
proliferation of endothelial progenitors at the site of vascular injury. The mechanisms involved in CD8 Tang cell
subset differentiation and function are not well defined. We hypothesize that HIV infection drives immune
activation of CD8 Tang cells and impairs their ability to promote vascular repair and, the chronic interference of
this pathway contributes to vascular inflammation and/or risk. In this proposal we will: 1) Identify the molecular
pathways involved in the differentiation and function of CD8 Tang cells and the role of PAR1 signaling in this
pathway. 2) Identify the impact of HIV driven T cell immune activation in CD8 Tang cell differentiation and/or
function and evaluate its relationship with cardiovascular risk/disease in patients with HIV infection. 3)
Mechanistically, in a murine model of LCMV infection, we will evaluate the role memory (tissue resident and
circulating) CD8 T cells to undergo CD8 Tang cell differentiation and determine the impact of PAR1 deficiency in
vascular repair and cardiovascular disease progression. These studies will establish the mechanisms of CD8
Tang differentiation and function in health and HIV infection. In addition, these studies will identify new molecular
targets to restore CD8 Tang function in patients. This research will have wide application in multiple
inflammatory diseases in which systemic inflammation is associated with cardiovascular risk.

10839986,"OVERALL: PROGRAM SUMMARY
Human immune responses to viral infection and vaccination engage a complex, multi-scale system involving
numerous diverse cellular populations residing in and circulating between tissues. The Columbia HIPC Center
has established a framework for human immunology studies that includes a unique tissue resource where
lymphoid, mucosal and peripheral tissue are obtained from individual organ donors, vaccine cohorts treated
with immunomodulatory therapies, and technology for single-cell genomics, imaging, and computational
biology. The overall goal of the Center is to obtain in-depth profiles of human innate and adaptive immune cells
in response to viral pathogens (including influenza, CMV, and SARS-CoV-2) and vaccine antigens in both
tissues and circulation, to provide a comprehensive assessment of the human immune response across the
body and over age. In Project 1 (PI: D. Farber), we will quantitatively analyze the contributions of virus type,
tissue, age, and sex on human anti-viral T cell immunity and define the functional states and clonal signatures
of T cells in diverse tissue sites with single-cell resolution. Project 2 (PI: B. Reizis) will produce a
comprehensive characterization of human dendritic cell composition and function in tissues and circulation in
the context of anti-viral immune responses and vaccination. In Project 3 (PI: P. De Jager), we will leverage a
cohort of multiple sclerosis patients treated with molecularly targeted drugs that selectively perturb immune
populations in a compartment-specific fashion. By following this cohort longitudinally through multiple cycles of
vaccination with sophisticated molecular profiling and single-cell analysis, we will answer fundamental
questions about the role of circulating and tissue-resident lymphocytes in maintaining T cell function and
responses to vaccines. All of these projects will be supported by five cores. The Administrative Core will
coordinate inter- and intra-center communication and collaboration, while managing financial aspects of the
Center. The Single Cell Core will provide state-of-the-art protocols and technologies for single-cell genomics,
including CITE-seq, scTCR-seq, scPLATE-seq, and a new technique for linking antigen-specificity with CITE-
seq and scTCR-seq of individual T cells called TetTCR-seqHD. The Immune Assay and Imaging Core will
provide quantitative analysis of antibodies and high-dimensional imaging technologies for spatial analysis of
gene signatures and cell-cell interactions in situ. The Clinical Core will organize tissue and patient cohort
resources, distributing tissue specimens and blood to project investigators. Finally, the Data Management and
Analysis Core (DMAC) will offer innovative computational tools for systems-level and single-cell analysis;
infrastructure for computing, data storage, and data curation; and tools for data sharing to ensure the long-term
impact of the Centerâs efforts. Together, the Columbia HIPC will uncover new insights into human immunity
and produce valuable data resources and reference maps for defining human immune responses across the
body and the human population."
10864792,"Despite the long-standing literature that has demonstrated changes in driving capacity following brain injury (BI) â little is known about the relationship of these differences and increased risk for driver error or the prediction of long term driving outcome after BI. However, it is well-established that the loss of the driving privilege negatively impacts functional re-integration, mood and quality of life â resulting from the reduced ability to participate in various life activities, work and educational experiences.

The challenge to increasing our understanding of how to best assess and predict driving performance after BI is two-fold. First, there is a need for novel assessment methodologies that can provide objective, detailed and repeatable metrics of driving performance. The current clinical gold standard â the behind the wheel (BTW) driving assessment, is over-dependent on subjective observations, lacks standardization, assesses only basic driving skills (due to safety limitation) and generates gross measures of performance (i.e., Pass/Fail). Second, there is a lack of follow-up studies that examine actual return to driving behaviors among individuals with BI. While some evidence for greater risk of crash involvement (often dichotomized as Yes/No) has been reported, these studies have relied heavily on self-reported data and offer little to no data about driver behaviors and/or modifications, risk-involvement, crash causing-behaviors or driving patterns.

The proposed study aims to address these limitations and employs an established virtual reality driving simulator (VRDS) that outputs novel driving performance metrics that are currently not available thru clinical methodology. The VRDS generates detailed metrics that can differentiate between clinical populations. Specifically, the study will integrate VRDS into an existing clinical driving assessment program and evaluate 100 individuals with BI across the process of returning to drive (e.g., from assessment to follow- up) and a sample of healthy controls. All participants will be assessed with both current clinical protocols and VRDS. This will be followed by a 24 month follow-up study including an innovative, 3-platform approach (in- car video-monitoring, web-based self-report and driving records) to quantifying returned to driving behaviors. The data collected will be used to apply both traditional (Regression Models) and novel (Machine-Leaning Models) analytical techniques to generate predictive models of relevant outcome variables (i.e., risk involvement, crash-relevant errors) that can be used to inform tailored driver interventions and retraining."
10757743,"Project Summary â Bioinformatics Core
The objective of this Bioinformatics Core is to support statistical and bioinformatics analyses to
study the effects of osteoporosis anabolic therapies (romosozumab, a sclerostin inhibitor, Scl-
Ab) on osteoblast progenitors as well as osteocytes in clinical and pre-clinical studies with
anabolic therapies. A short anabolic treatment window from Scl-Ab has been reported; in
contrast to teriparatide (PTH) that has a longer anabolic window. This Bioinformatics Core will
serve as the critical foundation for the research projects by analyzing cross-species data from
single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA-seq using innovative techniques and approaches.
The capabilities of the Bioinformatics Core will be enhanced by being able to leverage existing
datasets of whole genome sequencing in tens thousands of human samples; and osteocyte
gene expression signatures and deeply skeletal phenotyping from a unique mouse knockout
dataset from our collaborators. To support Project #1, Project #2 as well as pilot projects, the
Bioinformatics Core will provide statistical design, computational analysis, data quality control
and management support as well as accessing to other external human genetics and
bioinformatics data and resource. Specifically, in Aim 1, the Bioinformatics Core seeks to build a
synergistic data management, data analytical and bioinformatics pipelines over cloud
computing environment which allows interaction within investigators through data collection,
data analyses, information sharing and data interpretation. In Aim 2, the Core will provide
statistical and bioinformatics analyses for scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq generated from clinical
and pre-clinical studies to identify osteoblast precursor cell clusters over time with either Scl-Ab
or PTH treatments; osteoblast lineage tracing; osteoblast progenitors and osteocytes gene
expression patterns; and co-expression pattern over time. In addition, cross-species integrating
analysis will be conducted to identify homologous and divergent cell types between human and
mice. In Aim 3, we will prioritize genes regulating bone formation and Identify molecular
signatures affecting treatment effect via human gene expression (in bone biopsies) and genetic
variation associated with bone phenotypes (BMD, HR-PQCT derived bone structure, fracture) in
large-scale whole genome sequenced studies. In Aim 4, To further characterize skeletal function
and phenotypes of the genes identified from project# and project#2 transcriptome analyses, we
will utilize the existing KO mice deep phenotyping data; and generate a new KO mice strain.
Ultimately, these merged analyses will generate powerfully informed, novel hypotheses
regarding bone stem cell biology and responses to bone anabolic agents."
10757747,"Project Summary â Project 1
The goal of this project is to understand the effects of osteoporosis anabolic therapies on
osteoblast progenitors. This project aligns with the overall goal of the CORT in that skeletal
stem cells (including osteoblast progenitors) represent an important, yet poorly understood,
target of osteoporosis anabolic therapy. Specifically, this project will focus on determining why
the bone anabolic effect of romosozumab (anti-sclerostin antibody) wanes so quickly over time.
To accomplish this translational research goal, complementary approaches will be pursued
using patient and mouse samples. First, in Aim 1, in a prospective clinical study, we will obtain
bone-relevant bio-samples (trans-iliac crest core biopsies, bone marrow aspirates, and
peripheral blood) from post-menopausal women with osteoporosis during the course of
romosozumab therapy. These newly-collected samples will be analyzed along with bone
marrow samples previously obtained from post-menopausal women treated with teriparatide.
Therefore, we will compare and contrast the effects of these two distinct osteoporosis anabolic
agents. In this project, bone marrow aspirates will be analyzed by multi-color flow cytometry,
and non-hematopoietic stromal cells will be studied using a cocktail of antibodies that detects
surface-expressed antigens that sub-divide marrow stroma in order to define treatment effects
on human marrow stromal fractions. In addition, non-hematopoietic stromal cells will be
prospectively isolated for single cell RNA-sequencing. This analysis will afford unbiased
perspectives on the molecular heterogeneity of marrow stroma, effects of osteoporosis anabolic
treatments, and key information to explain the waning efficacy of romosozumab over time. To
complement these studies using human-derived samples, in Aim 2 we will combine lineage
tracing with single cell RNA-sequencing in mice to assess the effects of sclerostin antibody on
osteoblast precursors over time. Incorporating lineage tracing into our approach will prove that
putative progenitor populations become osteoblasts, and build confidence in cross-species,
conserved gene regulatory networks that are responsible the effects of osteoporosis anabolic
agents over time. Results from this project will be compared to comparable approaches in
Project 2 which focus on osteocytes. The Bioinformatics Core will play a crucial role in analysis
of cross-species single cell transcriptomic data. Ultimately, this merged analysis will generate
powerfully-informed, novel hypotheses regarding bone stem cell biology and responses to bone
anabolic agents."
10757753,"Osteoporosis and other diseases of bone fragility are treated with two classes of drugs: Anti-resorptives
(bisphosphonates, antibodies to RANKL) or anabolics, and their sequential or combined use. Anabolics include
PTH analogs (Teriparatide and Abaloparatide) and sclerostin antibody (Scl-Ab, Romosozumab) and increase
BMD and reduce fracture risk, but they have limitations and their activity wanes over time. Understanding the
mechanisms underlying their anabolic action and their decrease in efficacy over time could help identify novel
therapeutic targets and lead to better osteo-anabolic drugs. This application focuses on the role of
osteocytes, the most abundant cells in bone and âorchestratorâ of bone modeling and remodeling, in mediating
the effects of PTH1-34 and Scl-Ab in humans and in mice. Importantly, osteocytes are target cells of
PTH/PTHrP and the source of sclerostin. In mice, osteocyte specific deletion of the PTH receptor or the WNT
receptors (LRP5/6) prevents the anabolic response to PTH1-34 or Scl-Ab treatment, respectively, establishing
firmly that osteocytes play a major role in the responses to anabolic treatments. How they contribute to the
responses and to the decline in anabolic activity in humans is not known. Here, we propose to determine the
response of osteocyte to anabolic treatments, in humans and in mice, comparing early and late time
points responses. For this purpose, human biopsy samples from post-menopausal osteoporotic (PMOP)
women will be analyzed by histomorphometry, ultra-high resolution Âµ-CT and back-scattered EM (BSEM).
Osteocyte-enriched preparations from these samples will be analyzed by RNA sequencing. In parallel, similar
methods will be applied to OVX mice, a PMOP model, treated with the same agents.
Our specific aims are: 1) Specific Aim1. Determine and compare the changes in the human osteocyte
network in early responses to PTH(1-34) (Teriparatide) and early and late responses to sclerostin antibody
(romosozumab) in PMOP. 2) Specific Aim 2. Determine and compare the changes in the mouse osteocyte
network in early and late responses to the same anabolic drugs (PTH 1-34 and Scl-Ab) in a mouse model of
PMOP and compare these changes to the observations made in Aim 1 in PMOP women.
This project contributes to the translational theme of the CORT and addresses critical questions identified by the
CORT to advance the overall translational objectives. It may reveal novel therapeutic mechanisms and targets
that could significantly improve the efficacy, and possibly safety, of anabolic therapies. Further, this project
relates to Project 1, since osteocytes influence bone homeostasis and the bone marrow micro-environment, and
to the Bioinformatics Research Core, essential in the transcriptome analysis. The outcomes of this project will
inform the other projects proposed in the CORT by linking changes in osteocytes to the regulation of bone
modeling/remodeling and skeletal stem cells behavior. These studies will help generate novel hypothesis for the
therapeutic induction of an anabolic response in diseases of bone fragility."

10896017,"Overall Project Summary
 Insights from animal studies of noise-induced and age-related hearing loss suggest that the most
vulnerable elements in the inner ear are the synaptic connections between hair cells and sensory neurons.
This primary cochlear neural degeneration (CND) does not elevate thresholds, thus, it can be widespread in
ears with intact hair cell populations and can âhideâ behind a normal audiogram. It likely contributes to
difficulties understanding speech in a noisy environment and may be an instigating factor in the generation of
tinnitus and hyperacusis. CND may also be widespread, and even more severe, in cases of acquired
sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) where there is hair cell damage and threshold elevation. Thus, it may be a
major contributor to the well-known differences in auditory performance among people with identical
audiometric patterns of overt hearing loss.
 Our Research Center aims to take these paradigm-shifting ideas from animal models to human subjects.
Based on the synthesis of many research threads, we have devised a set of physiological, psychophysical and
behavioral assays of cochlear function and hearing that we believe are most powerful in diagnosing CND and
understanding its effects on suprathreshold hearing. In Project 1, we apply electrophysiological tests to
animals exposed to noise or ototoxic drugs and validate their utility in predicting the underlying CND and apply
behavioral approaches to assess the role of CND in generating tinnitus and hyperacusis. In Project 2, we
study human autopsy material from subjects with SNHL to directly assess the prevalence and patterns of CND
in humans and to evaluate its role in compromising word-recognition scores and as a risk factor for tinnitus. In
Project 3, we study patients with SNHL to characterize the effects of CND, as inferred from âbottom-upâ
electrophysiological measures of peripheral auditory function, on word identification in difficult listening
environments and to probe the role of CND in the generation of tinnitus and hyperacusis. In Project 4, we
further study the same subjects, probing the effects of CND on neural hyperactivity in central pathways, and its
âtop-downâ effects on the hyper-reactivity to sound that dominates the clinical burden of tinnitus and
hyperacusis.
 In our Research Center, we leverage the P50 mechanism to combine research perspectives from auditory
neuroscience and audiology in a coordinated study of the most handicapping aspects of SNHL. Progress in
understanding the effects of CND and how to effectively diagnose it, are of increasing importance as the
progress in regenerative therapies for hair cells and cochlear neurons move from laboratories to clinical trials."
10807046,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The outcome for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer (BC) has been significantly improved with the
use of HER2-directed agents; however, hormone receptor (HR)+/HER2+ BCs that express both HR and
HER2 are less responsive to anti-HER2 therapies as compared with HR-/HER2+ BC. Combined endocrine
therapy plus anti-HER2-targeted therapy have been clinically investigated, but only a small subset of
patients benefit from the treatment, indicating that HR+/HER2+ tumors have different biological
characteristics, such as ER and HER2 signaling crosstalk. Dual HER2-blockade induces a Luminal A-like
phenotype both in patientsâ tumors and in in vitro models. However, the molecular mechanism underlying
activation of ER signaling by anti-HER2 agents remains unclear. Using single cell RNA-sequencing
(scRNA-seq), we identified Bromodomain Containing Protein 8 (BRD8) as an essential hub bridging HER2
and ER signaling pathways. We found that, BRD8, a component of p400 histone acetylase complex, was
rapidly induced by treatment with a variety of anti-HER2 agents including neratinib, lapatinib and
trastuzumab and that BRD8 is at the high hierarchy of ER activation in responsive to HER2 blockade.
Furthermore, BRD8 regulates other growth promoting pathways in addition to ER. BRD8 knockout
significantly impairs growth of a fulvestrant-resistant cell line and xenografts, and BRD8 knockdown
enhances the sensitivity of HR+/HER2+ cells to HER2-targeting agents. These preliminary data lead to the
hypothesis that BRD8 is an essential hub linking ER and HER2 pathways and BRD8 mediates ER
activation in response to HER2 blockade in HER2+ cells. Therefore, combinatory BRD8 ablation with HER2
blockade should be effective for treating HR+/HER2+ BC. We propose three aims to test our hypothesis: (1)
to elucidate the mechanism of BRD8 activation by anti-HER2 agents in HER2+ cells at the single cell level;
(2) to define the roles of BRD8 in ER signaling activation and ER-independent functions upon HER2
blockade; (3) to test whether ablation of BRD8 sensitizes HR+/HER2+ BC to anti-HER2 blockade. The
studies will reveal, at single-cell level, the cell-cell variability of BRD8 induction by anti-HER2 agents, and
the novel functions of BRD8 in mediating ER/HER2 signaling crosstalk and ER-independent growth
promoting functions. The mechanistic insights will lay foundation for developing combinatory BRD8 ablation
and HER2 blockade therapy as a new treatment regimen for HR+/HER2+ BC."
10667584,"Project Summary
The US continues to suffer a critical shortage of well-trained clinicians to address the needs of a growing aging
population. Historically, non-geriatricians have not focused on the needs of older adults. Hence, clinicians in
other specialties must be trained and encouraged to focus their practice and research on the age-related
aspects of their discipline. Although important progress has been made through initiatives that integrate
geriatrics and aging research into the medical, surgical and other clinical disciplines, further significant
commitment is needed to train the future leaders in aging research. This U24 proposal seeks to accelerate
these efforts by building a robust, multi-faceted and highly-networked national platform that will organize
activities and provide resources for the cultivation, connection, and synergy of clinician-scientists in aging
research from disparate disciplines across the US. This objective will be achieved through a set of four
specific aims: 1) to develop an organizational structure that will facilitate the exchange and dissemination of
scientific and research knowledge on aging and the care of older persons; 2) to provide mentoring and career
development support for emerging investigators committed to pursuing aging research in their clinical
discipline; 3) to stimulate aging research, foster networking and collaborations across disciplines, and identify
and support high priority and understudied areas of aging research; 4) to develop and implement strategies for
assessing the effectiveness of the Clin-STAR program and to use this information to guide future directions
and report outcomes to stakeholders. The Clin-STAR Coordinating Center will accomplish these aims through
a broad array of strategic initiatives, including: developing a Clin-STAR website, social media presence, and
database that connects Clin-STAR investigators; organizing webinars, annual meetings and content-focused
transdisciplinary interest groups; identifying and partnering with other relevant networks; providing mentorship
and professional development resources; and supporting pilot grants, mini-sabbaticals and visiting
professorships. The Clin-STAR Coordinating Center will leverage the accumulated research, career develop-
ment, and mentoring expertise of over 20 clinician investigators (4 PIs, 10 co-investigators, and 8 advisory
board members) across 20 institutions, in partnership with the American Federation for Aging Research
(AFAR), which will serve as the National Program Office for the proposed activities. Innovative features
include an organizational structure that includes 3 prominent academic resource centers that will support core-
specific activities; leveraging the community of Beeson Scholars and NIA K24 recipients; an annual meeting
that will abut the highly successful Beeson Annual Meeting; creation of an Outreach Fund that will support an
array of opportunities to build leadership skills, support career development, raise the visibility of aging
research, and promote the Clin-STAR Program; a novel evaluative approach based on network science; and
efforts to establish a public-private partnership through philanthropy and leveraging existing relationships."
10909226,"Project Summary / Abstract for the Center for Molecular Imaging Technology and Translation
The Center for Molecular Imaging Technology and Translation (CMITT) is a National Center for Biomedical
Imaging and Bioengineering located within the Gordon Center for Medical Imaging (GCMI) at the Massachusetts
General Hospital. Working within the interdisciplinary environment (e.g., imaging and data sciences; image
reconstruction, processing and AI; pharmacokinetics; radiochemistry) of the Gordon Center, the aim of the CMITT is
to develop, validate and disseminate cutting-edge imaging technologies that take advantage of the game-changing
capabilities afforded by simultaneous acquisition of PET and MR. CMITT approaches PET/MR as a truly synergistic
modality, with novel radiochemistry, kinetic modeling, quantitative methods, image reconstruction and AI that exploit
properties of PET and MR signals. Thus CMITT advances the methodology of PET/MR and covers the entire range
of radiochemistry/radiopharmacy to image formation and processing including tomographic reconstruction and
estimation/quantitation, paving the way for research applications and clinical translation. Our pioneering work during
the initial funding cycle, Y1-4, of our P41 in quantitative PET/MR, has provided solutions to some of the most vexing
problems affecting PET/MR, including reliable and accurate corrections for attenuation and involuntary subject motion
(TR&D 1 in Y1-4). We have provided unique contributions to PET quantitation and image reconstruction by using
deep learning (TR&D 2 in Y1-4). We have also advanced novel radioligands and new molecular measurements,
starting from first concept to actual application (TR&D 3 in Y1-4). Accordingly, in this renewal application, we are in
a strong position to propose and develop new field-leading technologies pertaining to Molecular Imaging using PET
and MR. The TR&D1 of the renewal develops and delivers multi-parametric quantitative PET/MR imaging
technologies that not only enable physiological high-impact novel PET/MR but will also benefit standalone MR
research. The TR&D2 of the renewal develops an innovative artificial intelligence-based pipeline of data processing
in PET/MR, including image reconstruction, transfer learning, and uncertainty estimation. The TR&D3 of the renewal
uses the developments achieved in TR&Ds 1&2 to translate applications of PET/MR from physiological concept to
measurements in animal models and then on to first-in-human studies. The National Resource provides a unique
environment with an interdisciplinary team of highly accomplished scientists, engineers, and clinicians with diverse
expertise in multiple modalities and disciplines that supports service use of the Center's facilities by imaging scientists
throughout the country as well as Canada and Australia. CMITT will provide extensive training opportunities for
students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty, and seeks to advance the field of molecular imaging of normal function
and disease through active dissemination of new knowledge and technology."
10624976,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Antidepressants have been front-line treatments for chronic pain for years. However, clinical efficacy of
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIâs) has been moderate and highly variable across different
conditions, which calls for a deeper understanding of 5-HTâs role in modulating pain, in an anatomical and
receptor-specific manner. One area of recent interest is the amygdala. After neuropathic injury, neural activity in
the amygdala changes during the chronification process, while changes in 5-HT have also been detected.
Inhibition of the 5-HT2C receptor in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) âpermitsâ SSRI-induced
reduction of pain in rodents. In addition, genetic disruption of 5-HT2C prevents neuropathic pain development.
Taken together these data support the hypothesis that increases in 5-HT signaling through the 5-HT2C
contribute to the development and maintenance of chronic pain and ultimately influence the ability of
SSRIâs to be used to treat pain.
 To test this hypothesis, it is necessary to monitor 5-HT dynamics and neural activity over time in the BLA
after neuropathic injury from acute through chronic phases. Currently no implantable sensor is capable of multi-
channel detection of both phasic and tonic 5-HT release while recording electrophysiology over days. In this
proposal, we introduce novel flexible multi-electrode arrays âGC-MEAsâ that made of glassy carbon
microelectrode sites and interconnects on flexible and ultrathin polymer substrate. The GC-MEAs will be capable
of phasic 5-HT (with fast scan cyclic voltammetry) and tonic 5-HT (with square wave voltammetry) detections,
as well as neural activity recordings in vivo over 4 weeks. Our GC-MEAs represent a substantive technological
breakthrough in the understanding of 5-HT dynamics. First (Aim 1), we will optimize the fabrication process and
materials to obtain the most robust device with stable, sensitive and selective detection. Next (Aim 2) we will
validate this technology in the BLA acutely and chronically for four weeks. Finally (Aim 3), we will monitor tonic
and phasic 5-HT as well as neural activities in the BLA of mice during acute and chronic phases of a Spared
Nerve Injury (SNI), with or without SSRI treatment and 5-HT2C inhibition in BLA."
10614431,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Progress in basic neuroscience has improved our understanding of addiction neurobiology, but what has proven
difficult is translating this knowledge into effective relapse prevention treatments. Identifying the neurobiological
mechanisms underlying relapse will likely promote the development of better targeted therapeutic interventions
to prevent it. In our previous funding cycle, we showed that smokers with larger brain responses to cigarette-
related cues than pleasant stimuli are more vulnerable to relapse than smokers with the opposite brain reactivity
profile. The objective of this renewal is to identify the neuropsychological mechanisms underlying these brain
reactivity profiles and determine how these mechanisms affect vulnerability to cue-induced smoking relapse. Our
central hypothesis is that the brain reactivity profiles that we isolated in smokers reflect individual differences in
the tendency to attribute incentive salience to cues predicting rewards, a trait that increases vulnerability to cue-
induced behaviors. Our hypothesis is based on the incentive sensitization theory and it is supported by preclinical
findings and our own preliminary data. Animal models show that rats prone to attributing incentive salience to
discrete food-related cues (called âsign-trackersâ) are more vulnerable to cue-induced drug seeking behavior
than rats not prone to do so (called âgoal-trackersâ). Our preliminary data show that the same neuropsychological
trait predicts smoking relapse in smokers and cue-induced eating in the general population. We plan to test our
hypothesis by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Identify the neuropsychological underpinnings of cue-induced
behaviors. We will use the neurophysiological profiles derived from our newly developed cued food delivery
task to classify 100 smokers and 100 nonsmokers as sign-trackers or goal-trackers, and predict cue-induced
smoking and eating behaviors in the two groups. Our working hypotheses are that a) sign-trackers (both smokers
and nonsmokers) will be more prone than goal-trackers to cue-induced eating and b) smokers categorized as
sign-trackers in the cued food delivery task will be more prone than goal-trackers to cue-induced smoking in a
laboratory model of smoking lapse behavior. 2) Determine the effects of nicotine withdrawal on cue-induced
neurobehavioral responses. All participants will undergo two laboratory sessions. At session 2, smokers will
be nicotine deprived for 24 hours. We hypothesize that nicotine deprivation will increase cue-induced smoking
and eating behaviors in sign-trackers but not in goal-trackers. Our innovative neurobehavioral approach will
advance bi-directional translation by allowing us to tie individual neurophysiological profiles to cue-induced be-
haviors in humans. This project is significant because it will fundamentally advance our understanding of the
mechanisms underlying impulse control disorders, the first step toward identifying new targets for personalized
prevention and treatment interventions."
10670804,"Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects ~ 50% of men aged 40 to 70 and has a high impact on men's health
and quality of life. Current treatments are ineffective in the difficult to treat prostatectomy (16-82%) and
diabetic (56-59%) patients due to injury to the cavernous nerve (CN), which provides innervation to the penis.
With denervation the critical smooth muscle (SM) undergoes apoptosis and the penis becomes fibrotic, with
increased collagen abundance and a change in subtypes, thus altering the architecture of the corpora
cavernosa. This application is significant because we propose a novel integrative approach that targets the 3
main morphological changes that underlie ED, which are CN degeneration, SM apoptosis, and penile fibrosis.
 We've shown that sonic hedgehog (SHH) is a critical regulator of SM apoptosis in the penis and of CN
regeneration. SHH pathway is of high interest as a candidate ED therapy because SHH regulates a critical
nexus of pathways required to maintain erectile function. Our data in prostatectomy and diabetic patients
shows altered morphology and decreased SHH protein in high fidelity to our rat ED model. In the rat SHH
inhibition causes demyelination and axonal degeneration of CN fibers and CN crush decreases SHH protein
70% in the CN. SHH inhibition in the penis causes SM apoptosis and ED while CN crush decreases penile
SHH. We show reversible penile remodeling with reestablishment of SHH signaling using two innovative
peptide amphiphile (PA) delivery prototypes. In a crush model, SHH treatment of the CN (PA1) and of the
penis (PA2) accelerates regeneration, improves erectile function >60%, suppresses apoptosis and preserves
penile SM 56%. We will extend our observations to improve effectiveness of SHH delivery for maximal
apoptosis suppression and CN regeneration in preparation for clinical translation (Aim 1), and design PAs that
bind to SHH to fine tune release kinetics and duration in vivo in the penis (Aim 2). SHH PAs will be examined
in an aged prostatectomy model that better simulates ED patient conditions (Aim 3). SHH PA is highly
translatable for treatment of prostatectomy and diabetic patients by substituting human SHH protein for rat.
 SM apoptosis (2-7 days) occurs before increased collagen (7-14 days) in prostatectomy patients. We
propose the innovative hypothesis that suppressing SM apoptosis can prevent the fibrotic response (Aim 4).
Increased collagen is common in ED patients following prostatectomy. We show collagen abundance is
responsive to SHH signaling (SHH inhibition increases collagen/SHH treatment decreases collagen), by an
unknown mechanism. Microarray of corpora cavernosa from ED patients shows increased Gremlin 1, a BMP4
antagonist. SHH is a regulator of Gremlin in limb bud, Gremlin regulates fibrosis in lung, and BMP4 is
inversely responsive to SHH during development. We hypothesize that reduced SHH that occurs in the penis
with CN injury, up-regulates BMP4 leading to fibrosis (Aim 4). Understanding where intervention in the penile
remodeling process will be effective to prevent ED is critical for development of novel therapies."

This is the revised submission of the first competing renewal proposal for the âChicAgo Center for Health and
EnvironmenT (CACHET)â â the first NIH P30 Environmental Health Sciences (EHS) Core Center in the Chicago
area established in 2017 with an equal partnership between the University of Chicago (UofC) and the University
of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). With synergistic partnership between the two universities with complementary
strengths, CACHET promotes multidisciplinary EHS research among clinician, laboratory, and population
scientists to evaluate, delineate, and ultimately reduce environmental health related disparities among residents
of Chicago and beyond. The continuation of a dedicated EHS research center in Chicago is warranted by deep-
rooted environmental and social inequalities and their associated health outcomes across population sub-
groups. In this context, the CACHET mission is to elucidate biological, social, and behavioral
underpinnings between relevant urban environmental exposures and human disease and translate the
findings to reduce health inequities within our communities. Our overall goal is to mitigate environmental
health-related disparities among residents of Chicago and beyond. While there was some EHS research
at both institutions prior to the establishment of CACHET; over the past 3.5 years, CACHET has integrated this
research, brought researchers together, formalized and steered intra- and inter-institutional collaborations, and
significantly enhanced EHS research support infrastructure in the Chicago area. Specifically, CACHET has
established Biomarkers and Microbiome Cores, a dynamic Pilot Project Program (PPP), a vibrant Community
Engagement Core (CEC), and a highly translational Integrated Health Sciences Facility Core (IHSFC) â all new
to the Chicago area. Within this short time frame, and despite the COVID-19 pandemic, CACHET has made
positive impacts on interdisciplinary and inter-institutional collaborations, multi-sectorial partnerships among
community/city/state agencies, and translational EHS discoveries. Leveraging our progress and lessons learned
so far, and responding to reviewersâ critique of our first resubmission, we are moving forward by i) streamlining
CACHET focus group structure to improve interactions, synergy, and translation, ii) better leveraging the UofC-
UIC complementarity and institutional infrastructure to maximize CACHET efficiency, iii) responding to the P30
RFA new emphasis on translational EHS research, iii) addressing NIEHS strategic mission, and, iv) addressing
the trans-NIH initiative on structural racism on EHS research. We have revamped the CEC with new leadership
and a community-focused agenda; we formed a âEnvironmental Biomarkers Core (EBC)â by merging the
previous âBiomarkersâ and Microbiomeâ Cores with enhanced access to other institutional Omics Cores (not
funded by CACHET); we refined the IHSFC to augment its services to access and leverage large cohorts
established and led by CACHET members; and we have enhanced diversity in EH research capacity in Chicago
through pilot projects and tailored career development."

10418663,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Globally, 7 million deaths are attributable to the joint effects of indoor and ambient air pollution annually, with ~94%
occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In addition, secondhand smoke (SHS) is a major global health
problem, causing ~600,000 deaths (1% of mortality) annually, with women and children being disproportionately affected
by SHS. LMICs are also disproportionately impacted by SHS and related morbidity and mortality. The Republic of
Georgia (GE) is notably impacted by air pollution and SHS. Adverse environmental exposures cause 21% of disease
burden and 25% of deaths, including 30% of disease burden and 14% of deaths among children. Moreover, GEâs mortality
index attributed to ambient and indoor air pollution is the 3rd highest in the world. Additionally, the smoking prevalence in
GE is 58% in men (6th highest in the world) and 6% in women, implying significant impact of SHS in GE. Indeed, 42% of
GE adults report daily SHS exposure. Underscoring the impact of these statistics, GEâs 2017-2021 National Environment
and Health Action Plan indicates that addressing air pollution is among the most prominent public health priorities in GE.
However, there is limited in-country capacity to conduct research regarding the impact of such environmental hazards on
health. This application, the Emory-Georgia Clean Air Research and Education (EG-CARE) program, coincides with
increased prioritization of research and policy to reduce air pollution and address NCDs in GE, and represents a uniquely
strategic collaboration among Emory University, the GE National Center for Disease Control and Public Health (NCDC),
the GE National Environmental Agency (NEA), and Tbilisi State Medical University (TSMU). Various existing
collaborations and ongoing efforts will be leveraged, including Fogarty-funded grants to promote smoke-free air policies
in GE (an R01) and to enhance TB research capacity in GE (a D43), as well as an NIEHS-funded center grant called
HERCULES (a P30) and an NIEHS-funded T32 training program at Emory. Key leaders of these efforts and across these
institutions will collaborate to implement this training program, with the long-term goal of enhancing capacity in GE to
conduct research related to NCDs and environmental health (EH) and ultimately inform policy and practice to reduce
NCDs. The overall objective of this application is to develop and implement a training program involving training,
mentorship, and applied research opportunities to ultimately reach the long-term goal. Thematically, EG-CARE will focus
on the intersection between NCDs and EH, particularly air pollution, and aim to: 1) enhance formal NCD and EH training
opportunities and institutional infrastructure to support ongoing research training; 2) provide mentored NCD- and EH-
related research opportunities spanning from the molecular to the population level, with a particular focus on air quality
and pollution, to candidates with outstanding potential; and 3) emphasize research dissemination and knowledge
translation to inform policy and practice. Leveraging the aforementioned ongoing efforts, this proposal addresses a timely,
high-priority public health concern in GE, underscoring its potential impact. The program team is uniquely positioned to
address these aims and enhance research capacity related to NCDs and EH in the next 5 years and in the long term."
10874531,"Hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest growing cause of cancer deaths among Americans.
In the past decade, there has been an epidemic increase in metabolic (dysfunction) associated
fatty liver disease (MAFLD)-related cirrhosis and HCC. MAFLD is estimated to affect 1 billion
individuals globally and is projected to become the leading cause of HCC in the next 2 decades.
There is an urgent need to develop effective strategies to reduce HCC burden in the growing
MAFLD population. The overall goal of the Program Project (PP) is to reduce the burden of HCC-
related mortality through better understanding of contemporary risk factors (e.g., metabolic traits
and biomarkers) and protective factors (e.g., chemoprevention, HCC surveillance) of HCC related
to MAFLD. We propose three highly integrated studies. Central to this PP is leveraging and
expanding our multicity, prospective cohort of persons with MAFLD-related cirrhosis, the Texas
HCCC Consortium (THCCC) Cohort, which will serve as a resource for the proposed studies.
The goal of Project 1 is to develop HCC risk stratification models based on phenotypic,
metabolic, radiomic and genetic markers of metabolic dysfunction among patients with
cirrhosis. We propose the analysis of data and biospecimens from the prospective THCCC
cohort of >5000 patients with cirrhosis (and 350-400 incident HCC) to develop a suite of risk score
algorithms) for predicting the risk of HCC among patients with cirrhosis.
The goal of Project 2 is to evaluate the chemopreventive effects and potential harms of
metformin, statins or glitazones in reducing the risk of HCC in individuals with MAFLD. We
propose a retrospective cohort study using national VA datasets of >580,000 patients with
MAFLD. We will also examine the effect of genetic markers on the chemopreventive effects of
these medications in patients with MAFLD cirrhosis in THCCC.
The goal of Project 3 is to examine comparative cost-effectiveness of prevention strategies
in MAFLD. We will develop a mathematical simulation model and perform comparative analyses
of benefits vs. harms of chemoprevention and HCC surveillance in individuals with MAFLD, and
of using precision surveillance/chemoprevention using HCC risk stratification
We propose a Data & Analysis Core to support data management, data harmonization,
statistical analyses and web-based tools; a Biospecimen and Biomarker Development Core
to support collection, processing, transport and storage of serum and DNA samples from THCCC
cohort; and conduct biomarker assays for the projects, and an Administrative Core to provide
management, communication and coordination among projects, Cores, investigators and staff."

PROJECT/SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia, afflicts the U.S. and world with increasing
prevalence. AF incidence, progression to persistent AF, and AF complications, including stroke, are fed by
increasing obesity and age. Current therapies are limited by risks and limited efficacy, worse as AF
progresses, but no new pharmacologic agents have been approved for AF in >10 years. With identification of
>100 genetic loci that predispose to AF risk in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the hope has been
that genetics would yield novel therapeutic targets. However, even for the top locus on chr. 4q25 near PITX2, a
gene involved in formation of pulmonary veins, the target of AF ablation, mechanisms linking variants to AF
remain elusive. Genetic findings have so far failed to yield clinically actionable results. To fill these gaps, we
seek to go beyond GWAS findings to identify direct genomic mechanisms underlying AF and better understand
their interactions with environment, comorbidities or cell stressors. Our long-term goal is to use genomic
findings to personalize preventive and therapeutic strategies for AF. Our overall P01 theme is to translate AF
genetic discoveries towards the bedside, focusing on genes to mechanisms, genes to drugs, and interactions
of genes with metabolism and environment. We build on strong preliminary data and coalesce unique human
atrial tissue biorepository and genomic data resources, novel cell and animal models, and complementary
expertise from our multidisciplinary team with a strong collaboration history. Our Central Hypothesis is that
genomic mechanistic discoveries in AF cellular and animal models will translate to human therapies. Our
thematic aims include: 1) Identify causal genes and functional mechanisms with a goal towards identification of
new therapeutic approaches for AF; 2) Investigate metabolic and inflammatory mechanisms, implicated by
genomics studies to be important in AF pathophysiology, to identify new therapeutic targets for AF prevention
and treatment; and 3) Identify candidate novel drugs for AF and develop a pipeline for in vitro and in vivo
functional testing of candidate therapies. Project 1 Genes to Function will determine causal genes, variants
and mechanisms underlying two AF GWAS loci. Project 2 Genes and Metabolism will study the contribution of
mitochondrial dysfunction to AF onset and progression. Early Stage Investigator Project Genes and Nutrition
builds on novel associations of AF with trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), produced by gut microbiota from
precursors such as choline found in eggs, meats and cheeses. Project 4 Genes to Omics-Informed Drugs will
identify mechanisms and repurposable drugs to prevent AF progression. Projects are supported by 4 Cores
providing administration, engineered heart tissue and atrial phenotyping, electrophysiology, and network and
systems biology analytics support that synergize discovery and translation in AF and increase the scope and

10660939,"Dr. Jacob Doll, MD is a Staff Interventional Cardiologist at the VA Puget Sound Health Care System,
Acting Assistant Professor in the University of Washington Department of Medicine, Core Investigator at the
Seattle HSR&D Center of Innovation for Veteran-Centered and Value-Driven Care, and Assistant Director of
the VA Clinical Assessment, Reporting, and Tracking (CART) program. The proposed Career Development
Award (CDA) will benefit Veterans by improving the delivery of invasive cardiac care through peer learning
strategies, while provide the training and support Dr. Doll needs to become a leader in performance evaluation
and feedback and to drive innovation in cardiovascular procedural care.
 This research will develop and test a peer learning intervention that promotes percutaneous coronary
intervention (PCI) care quality. PCI, also known as âstenting,â is a common cardiovascular procedure that can
improve survival and quality of life when used appropriately. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly
among hospitals and physicians. Nearly all PCI procedures in the US are reported to national registries for
quality improvement purposes, including the CART program. Despite this wealth of clinical data and substantial
investment of time and resources to PCI quality, physicians who perform PCI are not receiving meaningful
feedback about their practice. Improved methods of audit and feedback are needed. Peer learning is a
collaborative quality improvement method that provides detailed, personalized, and actionable feedback to
clinicians from their colleagues. The performance of unnecessary PCI procedures and the technical quality of
procedures are of particular interest to VA. Of elective procedures performed at VA, only 24% are clearly
indicated by appropriateness criteria, potentially putting patients at risk without benefit. The nominee for this
CDA therefore proposes to design and test a peer learning intervention that promotes PCI quality and
appropriate case selection.
 The specific aims of the proposal are: 1) Identify barriers and facilitators to the use of peer learning
through surveys and semi-structured interviews with VA PCI operators and key stakeholders; 2) Develop and
refine a peer learning intervention that provides usable and acceptable feedback to PCI operators; and 3) Pilot
test a peer learning intervention to assess and improve PCI case selection and technical performance. This
research will directly benefit Veterans and the VA system by improving the quality of PCI and increasing the
frequency of appropriate PCI, thereby maximizing benefit while avoiding unnecessary procedural risks and
costs. It will build on the extensive ongoing investment in the CART program by developing a novel method for
promoting clinical practice change. Finally, it will develop methods of peer learning that are broadly applicable
to other fields. The research program will lead directly to a multi-site randomized controlled trial and ultimately
to the development of a national collaborative peer learning system that promotes physician development and
care quality.
 To achieve his research and career goals, Dr. Doll will acquire additional skills in qualitative methods,
implementation science, behavior change interventions, and trial design through coursework and directed
study. His research and training plan will be supported by a diverse and well-qualified mentorship team that
includes David Au, MD, MS (behavior change interventions, implementation of health programs, clinical trials),
Sunil Rao, MD (interventional cardiology care quality, clinical trials, observational research), Robb MacLellan,
MD (career development, physician training, quality improvement), and Christian Helfrich, PhD, MPH
(implementation science, behavior change interventions).
 This proposed CDA research, in combination with robust mentorship and training plans, will accelerate
Dr. Doll's independence as a physician-scientist and leader in cardiovascular medicine."
10829836,"Severe asthma (SA) is complex, multifactorial and refractory to treatment by corticosteroids (CS). In recent
years, some progress has been made in its treatment with the advent of biologics. However, despite these
advancements, there still remain challenges in the treatment of these patients because of an incomplete
understanding of the dysfunction of immune and epithelial cells, which underlies this disease. This is further
complicated by the poor biomarkers available to differentiate disease for targeted therapy, and amplified by
their enormous costs, particularly when prescribed imprecisely. Progress made in Project 1 in the current
cycle using mass cytometry/CyTOF, show clustering of SA patients into 2 groups displaying distinct immune
profiles divided along the lines of innate and adaptive immunity. Progress made in Project 2 in studies of
bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) in SA suggest the presence of two fundamentally different molecular
phenotypes. The BECs in one group primarily respond to inhaled environmental stimuli to drive an innate
intrinsic phenotype. In the second group, BEC cell death pathways intersect with CD8 T-cell immune
processes to drive an immune interactive phenotype. Taken together, these findings prompted us to
hypothesize that two distinct immune mechanisms, one regulated by innate immune cells, and the second by T
cells, are critical determinants of SA. Interactions between airway epithelial cells in the context of
genetic/epigenetic risks and immune cells together with induction of cellular death contribute to two SA
phenotypes. This hypothesis will be addressed in the following two highly interactive projects: Project 1 will
use human samples and mouse models of disease to: a) characterize the CITE-seq and TCR-seq airway
immune cells collected by BAL and investigate the impact of dupilumab on immune phenotype, b) study the
importance of FceRI-expressing innate immune cells and IL-7Ra signaling in FceRI+ cells in promoting a SA
phenotype using a novel protease-based mouse model, and c) study mechanisms underlying regulation of
TRM cell phenotype and impact on disease using a T cell-driven mouse model of SA. Project 2 will use fresh
and cultured healthy and asthmatic BECs to: a) determine the mechanisms for and functional implications of
an innate intrinsic epithelial phenotype, b) evaluate the role of GSDMB in the development of a CD8 T-cell
immune interactive phenotype and its functional implications, and c) Integrate immune-inflammatory
phenotypes with epithelial molecular phenotypes ex vivo and in vitro. Synergistic interactions among projects
will be afforded by support from: Core A, the Administrative Core, to coordinate the activities of the Program
Project at all levels, Core B, the Human Biological Sampling and Immunocytometry Core and Core C, the
RNA-Seq and Bioinformatics Core. Taken together, these projects will establish new concepts in immune-
epithelial interactions underlying asthma pathogenesis and identify novel targets for therapy."

RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are critical regulators of gene expression in eukaryotes. However,
the contribution of RBPs in oral epithelial homeostasis and oral pathological diseases remain
mostly elusive. Our recent efforts demonstrate that dysregulated RBP HuR (Hu-Antigen R)
disintegrate oral epithelium and contribute to oral tumorigenesis. HuR can bind AU-rich elements
of mRNA sequences and regulates its stability of translation. Our preliminary data revealed that
HuR binds and controls the expression of a subset of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in
glucose metabolism. In collaboration with the Mehrotra group we show that epithelial specific HuR
cross talk with immune response and contribute to oral tumorigenesis. Using T-cell immune
plasticity functions, we plan to study the functional properties of HuR in oral epithelial and T-cells
for anti-tumor activity. Here, we demonstrated that epithelial-specific HuR knockout modulates
the epithelial homeostasis and oral tumorigenesis, whereas HuR KO T cells exhibit enhanced
IFNÎ³ secretion by regulating glucose metabolism that alters the balance between the
immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Treg's) and effector T cells. While the oral epithelial
alterations by HuR likely reflects the metabolic cues from T-cells, a major unanswered question
pertains to the mechanism of HuR in human oral cancer where there are immune suppression
and metabolic reprogramming. Collectively, HuR targets glucose metabolism genes in the oral
epithelium and its involvement in T-cell specific immune plasticity stimulated a coalescence of
efforts from the Palanisamy and Mehrotra groups to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of HuR
and oral tumorigenesis, and T-cell mediated immune plasticity, respectively. The overarching
hypothesis is that HuR-mediates gene regulation and cross-talk between oral epithelial and
immune T cells compartments by a novel mechanism, and silencing HuR associated gene
network is critical for epithelial and metabolic reprogramming to limit oral cancer progression. The
outcome of our studies will result in advanced therapeutic intervention studies and translation
from bench to bedside."

The Minnesota HHEAR Targeted Analysis Laboratory brings together investigators from the University of
Minnesota and the Minnesota Department of Health with broad and internationally recognized expertise in the
identification and analysis of agents that are potentially harmful to human health at all ages. The combination
of expertises in our proposed laboratory is unique. Our scientists have years of experience in the development
and application of state-of-the-art high throughput analytical chemistry methods based mainly on mass
spectrometry for the assessment of trace amounts of targeted toxicant or carcinogen metabolites in large
clinical and epidemiological studies. Our scientists also have developed and applied methods for the analysis
of DNA adducts of cancer-causing agents in human samples. There are few groups that can bring together a
team with such superb and creative expertise on multiple relevant levels of exposure assessment. Therefore,
our overall goal is to provide human health researchers with access to state-of-the-art infrastructure for
targeted analysis of biological samples. We see this goal as firmly embedded within the concept of the
exposome and its relationship to human health. The specific aims of each component resource and the
development core are as follows.
The Targeted Analysis Resource will use predominantly high throughput mass spectrometric methods with
well-established quality control procedures to provide timely and reliable quantitative data relevant to 3 major
areas of importance to human health: Exposure to tobacco-specific compounds; exposure to environmental,
lifestyle, and nutritional toxicants and carcinogens; and variations in levels of endogenous electrophiles and
dietary compounds.
The Developmental Core will establish new high throughput methods to measure multiple classes of toxicants
and biomarkers in urine, plasma, hair, and toenails; to detect nutritional biomarkers from the intake of foods
and beverages in urine and plasma; to develop assays to detect a panel of internal biomarkers of stress in
multiple biospecimens; and expand our approaches to detect DNA adducts in saliva, blood and formalin-fixed
tissues.
The Administrative Core will coordinate all activities within the Minnesota HHEAR Targeted Analysis
Laboratory. In addition, this core will be the primary link to the HHEAR Coordinating and Data Centers as well
as the HHEAR investigators at all stages of their projects.
Collectively, the Minnesota HHEAR Targeted Analysis Laboratory will contribute to a productive and effective
HHEAR network designed to understand the impact of environmental exposures on human health."
10622618,"ABSTRACT
Over the past project periods we tracked the biological basis of cognitive decline and dementia to understand
the heterogeneous contributions of a dozen brain pathologies to individuals in the Religious Orders Study and
Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). We identified numerous genomic, medical, experiential, and
psychological factors associated with cognitive decline and incident Alzheimerâs dementia, and also
neurobiologic pathways linking some of these factors to Alzheimerâs disease (AD) and to related dementias. In
the most recent funding period, to understand the biological basis of risk factors, we analyzed multi-region
multi-omic data to identify novel and potentially high value therapeutic targets for the treatment and prevention
of AD and related dementias. The computational biology target nominations were validated with targeted
proteomics. All data are well-organized and shared publically with stakeholders around the globe.
The overall goal of the proposed continuation is to identify additional protein targets, and their splice
isoforms and post-translational modifications (PTMs) that drive AD related traits and can serve as
novel therapeutic targets. We focus specifically on the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, a region that is a
key hub in the neurodegenerative disease network. Further, several neurodegenerative disease pathologies
including tau tangles, TDP-43, Lewy bodies, and hippocampal sclerosis, are far more common in these regions
relative to the neocortical regions with existing omic data.
Aim 1 will generate bulk and single cell RNAseq and deep tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomics which can now
generate upwards of 10,000 unique proteins making it virtually genome-wide; it will use these data to identify
cell type-specific molecular systems, i.e., dozens to hundreds of coexpressed genes and proteins. Aim 2 will
identify the specific molecular systems that drive AD related traits; further, through integration of all omic data
from all regions it will identify key drivers of these systems. This will nominate genes and proteins that could
serve as therapeutic targets. Aim 3 will perform top-down proteomics to identify splice isoforms, proteolytic
fragments, and post-translational modifications of select high value proteins. Secondary aims will continue to
explore the biologic pathways linking risk factors to AD related traits which has been the main deliverable of
this grant since its inception; it will also share the newly generated data with the wider AD research community.
The proposal will deliver high value therapeutic targets which will be passed to the Accelerated Medicines
Partnership-AD (AMP-AD) consortium for further study. Thus, the identification of these proteins will have a
high and sustained impact on the field of aging and dementia."
10624838,"Background: More than 50% of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) patients have multimorbidity: the co-
occurrence of >2 chronic conditions. Multimorbidity impairs health-related quality of life (HRQoL); leads to
psychologic distress, disability, and mortality; and contributes to high health care utilization and costs. Most
chronic conditions require patients to engage in disease self-management, including adhering to treatments,
making lifestyle changes, and working with their health care team. Patients with multimorbidity face many
barriers to self-management and to attending in-person clinic visits. Given the limited time and competing
demands of primary care visits, patients with multimorbidity need additional support for self-management. Peer
support â assistance provided by non-professionals who are similar to the populations they serve â delivered
via telehealth is suited to address these needs. We developed a virtual, Veteran-led peer health coaching
intervention, VetASSiST (Veterans Activating Social Support for Self-management and Treatment
engagement), to help patients with multimorbidity overcome barriers to self-management and improve HRQoL.
Significance: VetASSiST is timely and efficient and aligns with the HSR&D priority that improving care should
support coordination and integration of care for the majority of Veterans who have multiple conditions rather
than building new single disease interventions. The proposal also aligns with other HSR&D priorities of Primary
Care Practice and Management of Complex Chronic Diseases and Virtual Care/Telehealth.
Innovation and Impact: Prior peer support trials address individual chronic conditions or mental health.
VetASSiST will be one of the first trials of an intervention to support Veterans with multimorbidity. It will also be
one of the first to leverage telehealth to remotely deliver peer support, which has the potential to increase
access to care. If effective, the intervention could be broadly implemented to improve patient outcomes.
Specific Aims: 1) Test the effect of VetASSiST, compared to usual care, on the primary outcome of baseline
to 12-month change in physical HRQoL, and secondary outcomes of mental HRQoL and health care utilization;
2a) Describe differences between VetASSiST and usual care on baseline to 12-month changes in intermediate
outcomes reflecting the functions of peer support and intervention targets: self-efficacy, patient activation,
health behaviors, social support, perceived access to care, patient-provider communication, and shared
decision-making; 2b) Examine whether intermediate outcomes mediate intervention-associated differences in
HRQoL; 3) Evaluate feasibility of translating VetASSiST into practice, including evaluation of per patient
intervention costs and barriers and facilitators to implementation.
Methodology: We plan a hybrid type 1 implementation-effectiveness randomized controlled trial of 320
Veterans with complex multimorbidity, defined as >3 chronic conditions in >3 body systems. Patients must also
have >1 of: 1) physical and mental health conditions; 2) frailty; 3) frequent emergency care; 4) polypharmacy;
or 5) high treatment burden. We will identify eligible patients using data from the electronic health record,
confirmed with self-reported information at screening, and will randomize enrolled patients 1:1 to VetASSiST or
usual care control. The primary outcome is change in physical HRQoL from baseline to 12-months, measured
with the SF-12. Secondary outcomes include change in mental HRQoL (SF-12) and health care utilization.
Guided by the RE-AIM framework, we will use quantitative and qualitative methods to assess barriers and
facilitators to implementation among key stakeholder groups. These data will inform future implementation.
Next Steps/Implementation: This hybrid type 1 trial will provide data needed to prepare for broader VA
implementation if the intervention is effective. Implementation activities will be coordinated with existing local
and national operational partners. If the intervention is not effective, Aims 2 and 3 will elucidate how Veterans
with multimorbidity could be better supported in the future."

Tuberculosis is the bacterial infection that kills the most people worldwide, especially in India, which has the
highest burden in of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in the world. Delays in adequate treatment due
to slow diagnostic tests and the usual one-size-fits-all MDR-TB treatment strategy lead to additional drug
resistance, terrible treatment-associated side effects, and high mortality. Rapid next generation sequencing
(NGS) from uncultured samples is a novel diagnostic tool that can predict resistance and minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) ranges for MDR-TB within 2 days of presentationâweeks before culture-based susceptibility
tests provide results. NGS-predictions allow providers to tailor MDR-TB treatment and choose doses to target
specific drug levels at the start of treatment. Most MDR-TB drugs reach steady state within 2 weeks, so early
therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) supported by direct observation of therapy could verify that predicted efficacy
targets are achieved as soon as possible, ensuring that patients get the right drugs at the right dose as early as
possible and before suffering side effects from poorly tailored treatment. This would be a dramatic improvement
over current culture-based methods of regimen selection, where results return 2 months later, if at all. Our clinical
site has previously enrolled ~800 participants with MDR-TB into cohort studies for longitudinal follow-up,
monitored participants for side effects and treatment outcomes, and developed on-site workflows for phenotypic
drug resistance, MIC testing, NGS from uncultured sputum, and plasma drug level testing of MDR-TB drugs.
Each of these tools is available at our site, but they are only employed sporadically, are rarely used in the same
patients, and have not been systematically analyzed for their relative contributions to patient outcomes. We will
conduct a single-site observational cohort study of 210 adult participants with pulmonary smear-positive,
rifampin-resistant TB to systematically evaluate the impact of a combination Baseline pRescription According to
Direct from Sputum Sequencing and TArgeted drug Concentration Strategy (BRASS TACS) for personalized
MDR-TB therapy as access to these tools expands. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) determine the
proportion of patients with MDR-TB in Mumbai, India with resistance-associated mutations that would prevent
treatment with moxifloxacin, linezolid, bedaquiline, clofazimine, or cycloserine using culture-free NGS; 2) identify
the proportion of cohort participants with MDR-TB that achieve model-derived steady-state plasma levels
meeting efficacy and toxicity targets; and 3) assess the time to final regimen, frequency of treatment-associated
side effects, time to culture conversion, and final outcome of cohort participants who complete culture-free NGS
and TDM. The results of this observational cohort will determine the combined benefit of these tools as they are
deployed at a referral center with clinical and laboratory expertise in complex drug resistance. These data will
describe the real-world outcomes of MDR-TB care using NGS and TDM for MDR-TB in a unique setting and will
inform the future application of these tools to improved strategies for personalized MDR-TB treatment worldwide."

HIV infects about 40 million people worldwide, among whom approximately 10% harbor chronic
hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection. The progression of chronic HBV to cirrhosis, end-stage liver
disease, or hepatocellular carcinoma is accelerated in HIV coinfection compared to chronic HBV
monoinfection. Nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) including entecavir and tenofovir are currently
approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. In HIV coinfection, despite HBV
suppression with NAs, there is still evidence for more severe liver injury and fibrosis compared
with NA-suppressed HBV monoinfection. However, the mechanisms by which HIV increases
HBV replication and HBV-induced liver fibrosis are not well characterized. One of the major
obstacles in HIV-HBV coinfection study has been the lack of a robust animal or co-culture model.
We have extensive experience in the study of HIV-induced liver fibrosis in HCV-HIV coinfection
and have parlayed this experience into relevant models for HIV-HBV co-infection. Using
HIV/HBV mono-culture and novel transwell and spheroid co-culture models (up to 3 lines)
developed in our laboratory, we have found that HIV increases HBV replication, HBV cccDNA
levels, and enhances HBV-induced fibrosis-related gene expression in HBV HepAD38, HBV-
infected NTCP-HepG2 and LX2 HSC cells. We have found that HBV and HIV infection each
induce cytokine disturbances that could contribute to fibrosis. Separately, we have found that
HIV enhances pyruvate production, which in turn promotes hepatic fibrosis. We hypothesize that
HIV cooperatively promotes HBV-related liver fibrosis through (1) alterations in profibrogenic
cytokine secretion and (2) changes in pyruvate status. To evaluate these hypotheses, we will
use in vitro mono-culture, and transwell and spheroid co-culture models and verify these
findings in liver and blood from in vivo humanized mice HIV/HBV coinfection models. These
Aims are feasible, mechanistically grounded, and highly likely to yield results that will lead to
clarification of HIV-HBV-host interactions. They are also likely to yield an array of new targets
for the development of treatments designed to enhance HBV functional cure and preventing
HIV-accelerated HBV liver disease progression."
10611486,"Brain metabolism is a fundamental aspect of biology and human disease. The brain critically depends on
glucose, consuming large quantities as the biochemical fuel for cognition, memory, and behavior. Fundamental
aspects of brain metabolism have been extensively studied, but recent evidence regarding the key role of
glucose and glycogen metabolism in neurological diseases has recently opened up new avenues of research.
The neurological disease where aberrant glucose metabolism has been investigated in-depth is Lafora disease
(LD). LD is an autosomal recessive, fatal, glycogen storage disease (GSD) that equally affects both sexes.
Symptoms emerge in adolescence with drug-resistant epilepsy, ataxia, neurodegeneration, and a rapid decline
into a vegetative state before death. Results from several labs using multiple models have demonstrated that
aberrant intracellular glycogen-like aggregates, known as polyglucosan bodies (PGBs), are the cause of LD.
Strikingly, we and others have identified PGBs in multiple neurological diseases and we hypothesize that
PGBs are a driving force in disease progression for brain-impacted GSDs, and that PGBs also play a
critical role in Alzheimerâs disease (AD).
 We have made foundational discoveries regarding glucose hypometabolism in LD, defined how PGBs
impact cellular processes, developed cutting-edge tools to determine the underlying cellular mechanisms, and
established therapeutic platforms to inhibit and/or eliminate PGBs. Defining the mechanisms of glycogen
metabolism in LD provides insights into how PGBs form and impact brain homeostasis. Thus, LD offers a
unique window into both normal brain glucose metabolism and broader disease implications when this
metabolism is perturbed.
 This R35 will combine our NINDS-funded, LD-centric R01 and P01, and extend our expertise to brain-
impacted GSDs and determining the role of PGBs in AD. Moving forward, we will further define LD-driven
perturbations in signaling at the molecular level, elucidate changes in cellular physiology, and establish novel
therapeutic modalities at the organismal level. Excitingly, the work on LD serves as a model for how to
interrogate brain metabolic perturbations in other neurological diseases involving PGBs. We will apply these
powerful LD-developed tools and insights to define how PGBs impact multiple neurological diseases,
determine the glycogen-centric molecular mechanisms impacting disease progression, and define how PGB
removal affects brain metabolism as a pre-clinical therapeutic. Importantly, we have key pieces of preliminary
data for LD, brain-impacted GSDs, and AD from both mouse models and patient tissue. The increased
stability, freedom, and flexibility provided by the R35 would allow us to make seminal discoveries in brain
metabolism and define the role of PGBs in multiple diseases while carrying out key steps in the development of
therapies and biomarker development.

10661662,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Prevalent, morbid, and costly (>$20 billion/year in 2000), incontinence is a major problem, especially for older
adults, in whom the most common type is urgency urinary incontinence (UUI). Ascribed to bladder spasms,
UUI's actual causes are unknown, and therapy remains inadequate. Recent data suggest that one cause is
poor bladder control by the brain. In our recent R01 we used biofeedback (BFB) as a probe to explore this. The
exciting findings suggest that there are â¥ 2 brain (pheno)types of UUI; that they respond differently to BFB, and
via different mechanisms; and that their response can be predicted. Our proposed new study will extend this
work to examine mechanisms of drug treatments to identify potentially new targets for therapy.
Data suggest that bladder control comprises 3 cerebral circuits which maintain continence by suppressing the
voiding reflex in the midbrain. In the phenotype that responded to BFB, the mechanism involved enhancing
deactivation of the first brain circuit (medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC) which resulted in less activation of the
second circuit (which includes the midcingulate cortex). In the phenotype that was resistant to BFB, no brain
changes were seen.
Yet, BFB is used less often than drugs to treat UUI. The mechanism(s) that mediate drug response are
unknown but likely involve changes in afferent activity ascending to the brain. The proposed study would be
the first to address this critical knowledge gap. It is based not only on insights generated from our BFB study,
but also on a pilot study of the bladder relaxant fesoterodine and our working model of brain/bladder control.
Our overall aim is to use fesoterodine as a physiological probe, to improve our understanding of the brain's role
in UUI and identify new targets for therapy. Specific aims are to: (1) test whether efficacy of drug therapy varies
by brain phenotype (the two identified in our BFB study or others that this study will identify); (2) confirm that
mPFC deactivation is a key therapeutic mechanism, regardless of intervention; (3) determine if drug therapy
normalizes brain response as a non-specific reaction to therapy; and (4) use newer MRI techniques to extend
our current methods and thereby confirm or refute our model of brain/bladder control.
To address these aims, we will randomize 150 women aged â¥ 60 years to receive 12 weeks of either fesoter-
odine or placebo and then switch them to the alternate therapy for another 12 weeks. The study will enable us
to correlate the change in CNS activation/deactivation with clinical response to therapy and also to discern
whether CNS changes revert as incontinence worsens following withdrawal of therapy (on placebo) and to
identify brain predictors and mechanisms of response.
The study will provide the first data on brain mechanisms involved in UUI response to a drug. Regardless of
results, it will contribute substantially to current understanding of UUI and continence, thereby enabling scien-
tists to develop new therapies based on the revolution in neuroscienceâand more hope for UUI sufferers."

Acute respiratory viral infections (ARVI) are the most frequently occurring global illness producing significant
morbidity and mortality, particularly in vulnerable populations. Children suffer higher frequencies of ARVI and
often experience re-infections. Common chronic diseases of childhood, most notably asthma but also allergies
(atopy) and obesity, can predispose to increased severity of ARVI. Similarly, adults with chronic inflammatory
diseases or on immunosuppression suffer significant consequences from ARVI. Adults with rheumatoid arthritis
(RA) have an increased risk for infection and respiratory mucosal inflammation may contribute to autoimmune
disease severity. The goal of this research program is to understand the molecular and cellular immune
signatures of the vulnerable host response to ARVI to identify novel therapies and individuals at risk for clinical
complications. The program includes a detailed systems immunology assessment of acute and long-term
airway and adaptive systemic immune responses to naturally occurring ARVI. The first project will identify how
asthma, atopy, and obesity lead to maladaptive immune responses to ARVI in pediatric subjects. The second
project will examine host response to ARVI in adults with RA. RA is a disease provoked by environmental
stimuli like respiratory infections and RA patients have baseline immune differences. These projects are
complementary and synergistic by utilizing similar sample types and timing of sample collection, and common
clinical endpoints. The individual projects benefit from shared multi-omics approaches through a Genomics
Core for the sample processing and generation of airway host transcriptome, proteome, epithelial methylation,
and viral quantity and expression data, along with host genetics. There is also a shared Adaptive Phenotyping
Core for the generation of high dimensional cytometry data to broadly characterize immune cell phenotypes
and for detailed identification of antigen-specific cells. This will allow for direct comparisons to be made
between the adult and pediatric cohorts to identify common and divergent responses to ARVI. In the Overall,
the first Specific Aim is to determine similar and divergent host responses to ARVI considering the pediatric
allergy/asthma (Project 1) and adult RA (Project 2) cohorts. The second Specific Aim is to consider these host
responses in the context of other large publicly-funded studies of viral infection through meta-analyses. The
final Specific Aim will be to develop predictive spatiotemporal models of how mucosal and systemic immune
responses to ARVI influence clinical outcomes. Our research program will produce novel mechanistic insights
into the diversity and commonality of human immune responses to acute respiratory viruses and use cutting-
edge methods to identify potential therapies."
10642966,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Prevalent, morbid, and costly ($66 billion/year in 2007), incontinence is a major problem, especially for older
adults, in whom the most common type is urgency incontinence (UUI). Generally ascribed to bladder spasms,
UUI's actual causes are unknown, and therapy remains inadequate. Recent data suggest that one cause is
poor bladder control by the brain. In our recent R01 we used biofeedback (BFB) as a probe to explore this. The
exciting findings suggest that one `phenotype' of UUI in older adults seems to be caused by a breakdown in
brain control, which can be restored by successful behavioral therapy, while another is refractory. Our
proposed new study will explore this further by attempting to differentiate the mechanisms associated with
disease and aging. The goal is to identify which brain mechanisms should be suppressed because they
are contributing to or causing UUI, which should be enhanced because they are helping to compensate
for UUI, and which should be ignored because they are incidental to aging and not related to UUI.
Current data suggest that bladder control comprises 3 cerebral circuits that maintain continence by
suppressing the voiding reflex in the midbrain. In our UUI phenotype that responded to BFB, the mechanism
involved enhancing deactivation of the first brain circuit (medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC) which resulted in less
activation of the second circuit (which includes the midcingulate cortex). In the phenotype that was resistant to
BFB, no brain changes were seen.
Yet, although we have an emerging picture of the brain's role in UUI, we have only rudimentary understanding
of what is `normal', i.e. how the brain normally controls the bladder. More relevant, we do not know whether
this control mechanism is the same across the lifespan, or if it changes owing to the impact of aging.
Thus, our overall aim is to characterize continence control in both young and old people, and examine how
changes due to bladder control failure differ in each age group. Our specific aims are to characterize normal
voiding in the continent old and young in order to better understand and verify the working model and to use
the comparison to older adults with UUI to understand the mechanism of brain failure in these individuals.
To address these aims, we will conduct a detailed clinical and neuroimaging study to study 80 asymptomatic
women and 80 UUI women, each group divided equally into young (18-45) and old (65+ years). The study will
enable us to evaluate the changes in brain structure and function and to identify brain mechanisms involved in
continence control, changes due to aging (both benign and contributory to UUI), and changes due to disease.
The study will provide the comprehensive data on brain mechanisms involved in the normal continence
mechanism in order to better corroborate our working model, understand the aging process, and assess
targets for therapy. It will thereby enable scientists to develop novel and more effective new therapies based
on the revolution in neuroscienceâand more hope for UUI sufferers."

Evidence-based programs (EBPs) delivered in school settings show great promise in reducing risk for the
development of emotional and behavioral disorders (EBDs) among elementary-aged children. However, efforts
to sustain EBPs in school settings face a number of barriers. Improving EBP sustainment in schools thus
represents a public health priority, but very little research exists to inform the development of sustainment
strategies. In order to address this gap, and build a foundation for sustainment strategy development, the
specific factors that predict sustainment need to be identified. To achieve this goal, the proposed project will
accomplish three primary aims: (1) Determine if malleable teacher (self-efficacy, burnout, attributions),
intervention (usability), and school (climate, classroom atmosphere, classroom-level adversity) factors predict
EBP treatment fidelity (adherence, competence) and modifications to EBPs (fidelity-consistent, fidelity-
inconsistent) during implementation or sustainment; (2) Assess the impact of EBP treatment fidelity and EBP
modifications on child outcomes (disruptive behavior problems, social skills) during implementation and
sustainment; and (3) Explore the mechanisms through which teacher, intervention, and school factors
influence sustainment outcomes. This project builds on a 4-year, federally-funded randomized controlled trial
evaluating BEST in CLASS, an effective, teacher-delivered intervention for K-3rd grade children at risk for
EBDs. The sample will include 96 teachers, 384 children, and 12 elementary schools in diverse communities
located in VA and FL. During the implementation phase, the teachers randomized to BEST in CLASS will
receive a one-day training followed by 14 weekly sessions of practice-based coaching. To achieve study aims,
a multilevel, interrupted time series design will be used to examine the relation between baseline factors,
treatment fidelity (adherence and competence to the core BEST in CLASS practices), modifications (fidelity-
consistent, fidelity-inconsistent), and child outcomes (disruptive behavior, social skills), followed by a mixed
method approach to elucidate the mechanisms that influence sustainment outcomes. Independent observers
will use a gold-standard, observer-rated measure with strong psychometric properties to rate treatment fidelity
and modifications to BEST in CLASS at 8 timepoints during implementation (baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, post-
intervention [14 weeks]) and sustainment (baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 14 weeks). Our long-term goal,
consistent with NIMH Strategic Priority 4 to strengthen the public health impact of funded research, is to
engage in research to maximize the sustainment of EBPs in school settings and thus improve outcomes for
children. This R01 is a critical building block in our effort to realize the promise of EBPs and will help us create
the blueprint for a strategy designed to improve EBP sustainment in schools that we can develop with a NIMH
R34 proposal and subsequently evaluate with a R01 proposal."
10617701,"Project Summary
Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are more prevalent in elderly individuals due to the
increased susceptibility to injury and diminished repair capability of the aging kidney. Age-related decline of renal
function may reflect multicellular dysfunction that leads to reduced capability of the kidney to repair or regenerate
in response to stress. Our group previously identified MG53 as a key component of cell membrane repair, which
plays a vital role in protection against AKI. We know that renal proximal tubular epithelia (PTE) contain
endogenous MG53 protein. In principle, compromised function of MG53 to repair injury to PTE may be an intrinsic
mechanism that contributes to reduced kidney function in aging. We also know that MG53's myokine function in
tissue repair is compromised in aging. A loss of the crosstalk from muscle to kidney may constitute an extrinsic
mechanism leading to the increased vulnerability of the kidney to function properly during aging. This project is
centered on testing the hypothesis that MG53 participates in the multicellular process of aging-related AKI and
CKD by maintaining the integrity of PTE cells and facilitating muscle-kidney crosstalk. We have made a novel
finding that links MG53's myokine function in control of intracellular Ca signaling to modulation of inflammasome
activation associated with kidney injury and fibrosis. Thus, we developed a novel concept that engineering of
macrophages with tailored secretion of MG53 can enhance renoprotection via harnessing inflammation and
fibrotic remodeling associated with CKD. If proven, these findings can have a significant impact on geriatric
medicine research, as chronic inflammation and fibrosis occur during the aging process and can impact the
function of many organs including kidney."

The proposed Wadsworth Center Human Health Exposure Analysis Resource (WC-HHEAR): Targeted
Exposure Analysis Laboratory leverages access to a well-established targeted biomonitoring laboratory based
at Wadsworth, which is recognized internationally as a world class public health laboratory and research institute.
Wadsworth has developed significant capability and capacity for the targeted analyses required to help HHEAR
become a success and has added experience from having been one of the six CHEAR laboratory hubs. The
proposed WC-HHEAR resource is led by two MPIs with over 65 years of combined experience analyzing
biospecimens for organic and inorganic targets, and who have collaborated together and with other researchers
for two decades to advance our understanding of environmental exposures and human health; their collective
contributions amount to over 700 published papers in the field of exposure measurements. The Administrative
Core will provide an effective infrastructure and the support to ensure that WC-HHEAR is well-integrated into the
Wadsworthâs Division of Environmental Health Sciences. Staff from the Administrative Core will work to confirm
the day-to-day lab hub operations are smooth, and that excellent communications are maintained within the hub,
and between the hub, the other HHEAR components, and with HHEAR clients. The proposed WC-HHEAR
Targeted Analysis Resource (TAR), which is at the heart of this proposal, offers extensive capabilities that extend
over 30 chemical classes, and hundreds of individual targets, and in many different biological tissues and fluids.
The benefit to HHEAR clients includes multiple pre-and-post analytical consultations with experienced laboratory
staff and subject matter experts that have reputations for high-quality analytical work. The TAR will also leverage
the experience and capability that Wadsworth brings as an international provider of proficiency testing and as a
producer of well-characterized biological reference materials that will help ensure the harmonization of data
reported by laboratories world-wide for trace elements and trace organics in biological matrices. The WC-HHEAR
Development Core will work to advance existing methods to improve efficiency, and achieve lower limits of
detection, while working with increasingly smaller sample masses/volumes. The Development Core will also
work to extend our capabilities in non-traditional matrices, increasing the number of targets measured and in
many more matrices. Additionally, WC-HHEAR will adapt to the challenges ahead, whether driven by discoveries
in the untargeted resource, or from HHEAR clients requesting increased throughput for our established assays."
10613899,"Project Summary: Osteoporosis is a complex disease characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD),
bone fragility, and an increased risk of fracture. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for BMD have
identified over 1100 associations. This âtreasure troveâ of novel genetic information has the potential to
revolutionize our understanding of bone biology and the treatment of bone diseases; however, few of the
causal genes underlying associations have been identified. The long-term goal of my lab is to reduce this
knowledge gap using innovative analytical and experimental strategies. A number of approaches exist to
identify genes responsible for GWAS associations. However, most rely on population-based â-omicsâ data,
which are scarce for human bone, to connect variants to molecular alterations. Furthermore, most approaches
do not provide information on how causal genes impact âsystems-levelâ function. To address these limitations,
we recently used co-expression networks generated from mouse bone transcriptomic datasets to inform BMD
GWAS. The idea is simple â genes that play a central role in the regulation of a complex trait are often
functionally-related and functionally-related genes are often co-expressed. We demonstrated that by identifying
modules of co-expressed genes in bone tissue that were enriched for genes implicated by GWAS, we were
able to predict target genes and infer how they impact BMD. We have shown experimentally that several
genes (MARK3, PPP6R3, etc.) identified using this approach are true regulators of BMD. However, to date our
analyses have been based only on enrichment of genes implicated by GWAS in undirected networks
generated from heterogenous bulk bone transcriptomic datasets of limited cellular diversity. Here, we address
these limitations using an innovative analytical approach incorporating Bayesian networks and key driver
analysis (KDA) and apply this strategy to transcriptomic data from primary bone cell cultures and osteoblast
subtypes defined by single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). We hypothesize that our approach of integrating GWAS
with directed networks representing all major bone cell types will identify novel genes with direct and central
roles in regulating BMD and elucidate how such genes impact network architecture. We will test this
hypothesis through three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will discover novel BMD GWAS target genes through the
integration of bone and bone cell networks and GWAS data. In Aim 2, we will discover novel BMD GWAS
target genes through the integration of osteoblast cell-type specific networks and GWAS data. In Aim 3, we will
define the impact of novel BMD GWAS target genes on BMD and bone network homeostasis. Our innovative
approach for informing GWAS will identify causal BMD genes and lead to the discovery of putative therapeutic
targets for the prevention and treatment of bone fragility."
10643954,"Summary
Cardiopulmonary toxicities following thoracic radiotherapy and PD-1 blocking immunotherapy have a major
impact on quality of life and survival. Therefore, there is an unmet need to have early diagnostic test and
intervention for fatal toxicities. Our proposal aims to understand immune mechanisms that modulate
potentially life-threatening cardiopulmonary toxicities. We propose to study the toxicities in both mouse models
and patients by analyzing blood samples. To achieve our goals, we have assembled a collaborative team
across three institutions with a group of expert consultants in order to identify biological correlates and
therapeutic targets to ameliorate these autoimmune toxicities. Our prior studies showed excessive mortality in
mice simultaneously exposed to radiotherapy and PD-1 inhibition, which we show is dependent on both the
cytokine IL-17A and the B-cell. Since both Th17/IL-17A and humoral immunity are implicated in autoimmune
diseases, we hypothesize that toxicities result from the unchecked adaptive Th17 response due to PD-1
blockade, combined with autoantibodies against heart and lung tissues generated by the pro-inflammatory B-
lymphocytes. We will employ mouse models and pharmacological inhibitors to dissect the underlying
autoimmune mechanisms and measure key components of Th17 and B-cell response in prospectively
collected blood samples from lung cancer patients undergoing combine radiotherapy and immunotherapy.
Aim 1: To determine whether IL-17A/Th17 responses mediate the toxicities. We hypothesize that both
innate and adaptive immunity contributes to the toxicities through the link of IL-17A. We will generate KO mice
unable to produce IL-17A through either neutrophils or CD4 T cells. We expect that the toxicities are
attenuated when Th17/IL-17A are blunted in these mouse models. To determine whether IL-17A/Th17 can be
used as predictive biomarkers for the toxicities, we will examine dynamic changes of Th17/IL-17A in serum
samples from our patients. Aim 2: To determine the role of humoral response in mediating the
toxicities. We hypothesize that pro-inflammatory Tbet+ B-lymphocytes drive autoantibody production which
results in the toxicities. We will use Tbetflox/flox CD19cre mice as our model, in which mature Tbet+ B cells are
absent. This approach will be complemented by pharmacological depletion of B cells using anti-CD20 or by
neutralizing autoantibodies with IVIg in wild-type mice. We expect that the toxicities are attenuated in these
models. Furthermore, we will test whether pharmacological inhibitors of Th17/IL-17A reduce Tbet+ B cells and
autoantibodies. Finally, the rise of autoantibodies in blood will be captured in mice and patients as a surrogate
for the toxicities. Our study of basic mechanisms in preclinical models, combined with analysis of patient
samples, will lead to novel diagnostics for early detection and improved therapies for severe cardiopulmonary
toxicities."

 The La Jolla HIPC team will focus on pathogens causing infectious diseases of the upper and lower
respiratory tract that lead to substantial mortality and morbidity. Our approach is unique and innovative, as it
focuses on defining immune signatures (IMS) of antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells generated in response to
natural infection with important respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, Common Cold Coronaviruses
(CCC), influenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Likewise, our
Program will investigate IMS of antigen-specific T cells generated following vaccination against a diverse array
of pathogens in different platforms like attenuated pathogens (BCG, yellow fever (YF)), purified proteins (acellular
Bordetella pertussis (PT) vaccines), viral vectors (J&J, SARS-CoV-2) and mRNA (Moderna and Pfizer).
 In Project 1, we will perform longitudinal analysis to determine persistence and plasticity of antigen-specific
T cell responses following natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. We will study T cell responses specific
to SARS-CoV-2 following vaccination with different vaccine platforms in previously-unvaccinated donors, and in
a longitudinal cohort of vaccinated individuals previously naturally-infected with SARS-CoV-2. In parallel studies,
we will analyze T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 in naturally-infected unvaccinated donors. We will also analyze
T cell responses in two previously-enrolled cohorts who received YF and PT vaccinations; in both cohorts the
natural evolution and persistence of T cell responses to CCC viruses will be investigated.
 In Project 2, we will perform longitudinal analysis of the IMS of Mtb-specific T cells. Here, we will build on
our progress made during the previous HIPC funding period to characterize the IMS associated with latent and
active TB disease as well as BCG vaccination. Specifically, we will characterize the longitudinal IMS of both
active and latent TB during treatment. In parallel, we will characterize the longitudinal IMS of adults
(re)vaccinated with BCG, and characterize the IMS of Mtb-specific T cells in the lung.
 In Project 3, we will determine the molecular properties of pathogen-specific lung tissue-resident memory T
cells (TRM). Our goal is to establish a single-cell atlas of the transcriptome, epigenome, and T cell receptor (TCR)
of antigen-specific lung TRM targeting common pathogens that infects the lungs such as: viral (influenza, RSV,
para influenza, meta pneumovirus, SARS-CoV-2, CCC), bacterial (pneumococcus, PT, Mtb) and fungal
pathogens. The longitudinal study design will enable assessment of plasticity and persistence of lung TRM cells
following natural infection and vaccination. The synergy between Projects will allow the generation of cross-
comparable large-scale single-cell T cell signatures for respiratory pathogens/vaccines."
10745337,"The effectiveness of social buffering in regulating stress appears to wane for a period with
puberty at the same time that stress-reactivity increases and young adolescents become more
vulnerable to stress-related affective pathology. However, there is a dearth of knowledge
regarding the neural underpinnings of social buffering in children and the changes in neural
responses to potential social buffers with puberty. Two of the proposed experiments address
this gap in knowledge. In addition, to date, the loss of social buffering effectiveness with puberty
has primarily been examined using activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA)
axis as the stress measure. All three proposed experiments will examine the pervasiveness of
the effect by examining sympathetic and parasympathetic responses, in addition to salivary
cortisol. Urinary oxytocin will also be examined because of its role as an anti-stress hormone.
Finally, the effectiveness of parents and friends as social buffers during the peripubertal period
has only been examined for social evaluative stressors. The proposed experiments will
determine whether the loss of social buffering also extends to threat stimuli as it does in adults
and to situations in which two friends are both experiencing the stressful event together. Finally,
all three proposed studies will explore whether puberty is associated with an emergence of sex
differences in social buffering by parents and friends. Participants will be 11-14 years old and
Tanner staging by nurse exam along with self-report and testosterone and DHEA will index
pubertal status. Our prior research uncovered the waning of the effectiveness of parents to
serve as social buffers of the HPA axis over the pubertal transition and the concomitant failure
of friends to âstep inâ as stress buffers. The proposed experiments are the logical extension of
this work. The results will have the potential to drive significant attention to the role of
developmental disruptions in social stress buffering as possible contributing factors in the rise of
affective problems in the early teen years."

A fundamental goal of human genetics is to decipher the relationship between genotype and phenotype.
Cancer is defined as a disease comprising a heritable genetic component that confers cancer predisposition
and an acquired (somatic) component where disease is driven by an accumulation of genetic mutations
leading to ever increasing deregulation of normal cellular functions. Population based genome wide
association studies (GWAS) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) analyses have identified thousands of
germline risk variants for ovarian cancer and somatic non-coding mutations involved in ovarian cancer
development. Identifying genomic regions where there are interactions between germline and somatic variants
may enable us to identify the critical drivers of disease. We have established an end-to-end pipeline that can
efficiently evaluate the functional significance of thousands of genetic variants in disease at once. We have
also established ex-vivo models of fallopian tube secretary epithelial cells (precursors of ovarian cancer) and in
vitro 3D models of chemoresistant ovarian cancer. In this proposal, we plan to address provocative question #3
âDo genetic interactions between germline variations and somatic mutations contribute to differences in tumor
evolution or response to therapy?â with the following specific aims: (1) Use computational approaches, to
identify genomic regions where germline and somatic genetic variants converge to indicate shared target
genes and regulatory networks driving ovarian cancer development; (2) Use chromosome conformation
capture assays to validate interactions between regulatory targets and their target genes; (3) Use
CRISPR/Cas9 screens to establish the functional significance of germline-somatic interacting regions in
ovarian cancer development."
10841534,"ABSTRACT (Overall)
Malaria, HIV/AIDS, and Covid are three of the most devastating infectious diseases, impacting millions of people
world-wide. Effective vaccines against the pathogens that cause these diseases (HIV, SARS-CoV-2 and
Plasmodium falciparum) have proven elusive and/or affected by pathogen variation and thus traditional vaccine
approaches are unlikely to succeed in eradicating these diseases. In addition to our limited understanding of the
desired immune responses to confer protection against the pathogens and our limited ability to elicit such
responses, vaccine efficacy is also confounded by the diversity of pathogens, human populations, environmental
exposures, and health status. The projects described herein are designed to support the identification of immune
profiles that correlate with vaccine efficacy and are of potential relevance to protection against HIV-1, SARS
CoV-2 and P. falciparum infection. Beyond the importance of combatting these diseases, the strategies for
profiling immunity in response to infection and vaccination hold promise for garnering fundamental insights into
the complexity of the human immune system. Such insights have the potential to impact strategies for vaccine
development and for producing new therapies for many diseases."

Arkansas, located in the Southern region of the United States, ranks among the lowest in the nation in overall
health outcomes and in cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Within Arkansas, place- and race-based
disparities are quite profound, and rural residents and Blacks/African Americans fare the worst. Forty one-
percent of Arkansans live in rural areas where socioeconomic distress, chronic disease risk factors, and social
structural factors underlying these disparities have not changed in decades. Poverty and food insecurity are
higher, and wages, employment opportunities and health care access are lower in rural than in urban Arkansas.
Blacks/African Americans have the highest cancer and CVD mortality rates, the worst socioeconomic indicators,
and have experienced enormous historic trauma, particularly in the Delta regions. To address this historical
embedment of place- and race-based health inequities in Arkansas, the proposed Center for Research, Health,

of a robust process for advancing novel multilevel and transdisciplinary research, engaging communities in
equitable partnerships to address the root causes of chronic disease disparities, and building, training and
mentoring a diverse and competent research workforce prepared to eliminate disparities in cancer and CVD.
Our social justice framework will help the CRHS identify interconnected patterns of systematic disadvantage in
the community and in our research ecosystem to inform how the cores, research projects, advisory boards, and
our broad-based coalition of academic and community partners can work synergistically to accomplish CRHS
goals. Our coalition of stakeholders includes partners in the Northwest, Highlands and Delta regions of Arkansas

outcomes. The KCI has 191 members belonging to four scientific programs (Cancer Biology, Translational
Oncology, Quantitative Oncology, and Cancer Prevention and Control) and using six Shared Resources.
In the past reporting period, we developed and are implementing a comprehensive strategic plan which defines
three focus areas for our center: Culture of Inclusion and Innovation, Precision Oncology, and Precision Early
Detection. We have defined a comprehensive Diversity Action Plan to align with OHSU's efforts to be an anti-

strategic plan as a compass, we recruited 56 investigators, including 12 senior leaders. We completed the design
and construction of three new buildings, which allowed for the consolidation of our research and clinical care.
We restructured our administration and advisory committees to ensure our members' engagement in the effective
implementation of the strategic plan. These efforts have led to substantial increases in CCSG metrics, including
NCI funding, intra- and inter-programmatic interactions, collaborative grants, and investigator-initiated trials.
Thus, our current 191 KCI members are supported by $61.6 million in extramural funding, $26.9 million from the

10876533,"Project Summary/Abstract
Mitragyna speciosa (kratom) is a plant indigenous to Southeast Asia with over 40 bioactive alkaloids, two of
which, mitragynine (MG) and 7-hydroxymitragynine (HMG), act at mu opioid receptors (MORs). Use of kratom
and kratom products increased in the US contemporaneous a critical change-point in the opioid crisis (when
painkiller prescribing became more conservative), with many US adults initiating kratom use for putatively
therapeutic indications, such as mitigation of withdrawal from prescribed or nonprescribed opioids, and as a
self-treatment for symptoms of pain, fatigue, or psychiatric or substance use disorders (SUDs). The number of
US users in the past few years is likely >10 millionâand increasing. Yet we have little understanding of the
balance of, or determinants of, beneficial or adverse effects of kratom either proximal to use (e.g., sedation,
nausea, analgesia) or over time (e.g., symptoms of SUD). Preclinical work shows that MG and HMG act as
partial biased at MORs but also have non-opioid mechanisms of action and that these and other alkaloids may
have therapeutic potential for the treatment of pain and SUDs with less risk than traditional opioids. This
converges with self-report data, where there is remarkably consistent therapeutic benefit attributed to kratom
with minor-moderate side effects and fewer indicators of abuse potential than might be expected from a
substance that, for some, reportedly substitutes for opioids. Yet this work is limited to cross-sectional surveys,
case reports, and social-media analyses, which may suffer from self-selection and recall bias and sheer lack of
information. Many large surveys of regular users are outdated, given rapid expansion of kratom products, and
diverge from findings in smaller samples, particularly with respect to prevalence of kratom addiction and
withdrawal. Given kratomâs complex pharmacology and novelty (in the US), and the accompanying near-
vacuum in policy and in clinical recommendations, more work is needed to understand its risks and potential
benefits. So, too, is scientific consilience in developing a systematic line of kratom research. The aims of this
K99/R00 work towards both. For the K99, we aim to, using a sample of kratom-using US adults: (1) conduct
momentary assessment of individual instances of kratom product use in daily life; (2) determine associations of
momentary responses with directly assayed content of samples of participantsâ kratom products; (3) evaluate
relationships among kratom effects (including withdrawal-like effects), the kratom products used, and alkaloid
concentrations in biospecimens; (4) explore narrative accounts of kratom use. For the R00, I will (5)
systematically evaluate effects of kratom discontinuation. Collectively, these studies will be a bridge to
randomized interventional studies to be proposed in an R01. These studies also begin the interdisciplinary and
interinstitutional collaboration I believe is needed in kratom research, reflected by the diversity of knowledge
and expertise of my K99 mentors and collaborators who will ensure that my enhanced training places me on
the strongest foundation for developing into one of the top leaders in the field of human kratom research."
10841473,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most commonly diagnosed developmental disorder of
childhood, affecting ~9% of children nationwide. Although ADHD dramatically increases the risk for poor
academic achievement, substance abuse, and criminal behavior, particularly in adolescence, too little is known
regarding how neurobiological developmental trajectories underlie these behavioral and clinical outcomes. This
remains the case in spite of the importance of such work for earlier identification of risk factors, more targeted
treatment models, and, in turn, education, juvenile justice, and healthcare savings for individuals, families, and
society. The goal of the current project, therefore, is to characterize longitudinal neural, behavioral, and clinical
trajectories of youth with ADHD from late childhood to mid-adolescence. Brain systems underlying cognitive
control and motivation in particular have been identified as centrally important both to the neural etiology of
ADHD and to the general increase in risk-taking behavior and poor decision-making observed in typically
developing (TD) adolescents. An important aspect of these models is how brain regions underlying these
processes form coherent networks, as well as how these networks interact and influence each other to produce
behavior. Here we bring together these two disparate literatures to gain understanding of the transition to
adolescence in youth with ADHD. Thus, this proposal focuses on the maturational course of the cognitive control
and motivation systems, individually and in interaction, in youth with and without ADHD in a multi-session
longitudinal design. The aims of this proposal include: 1) Characterize behavioral trajectories of cognitive control,
motivation, and their interaction in ADHD and TD youth from childhood into adolescence; 2) Characterize the
development of structural and functional brain network organization during the same time period, focusing on
brain networks underlying cognitive control and motivation; and 3) Identify neural, behavioral, and clinical
features of pre-adolescent ADHD that predict clinical outcomes and risk-taking behavior during adolescence. To
address these aims, innovative network analytic tools based on graph theory and structural equation modeling
will be applied to structural and functional connectivity estimates of MRI data during diffusion-weighted imaging
(structural) and during rest, cognitive control, motivation, and risk-taking tasks (functional). These techniques are
uniquely able to simultaneously characterize the strength and coherence of within-network structural/functional
connectivity and across-network interactions, as well as to identify important brain network features that
differentiate across groups. Additionally, behavioral performance on the cognitive control, motivation and risk-
taking tasks, ADHD symptomatology, and risk-taking attitudes and behavior will be assessed. This program of
research is directly in line with the NIH Strategic Plan and builds on the RDoC framework. Together, these
findings will provide the groundwork that can lead to early identification and, ultimately, prevention of ADHD
trajectories that are more likely to lead to adverse outcomes in adolescence."

 The object of interest is not always visible at the time of movement. Visuospatial working memory plays an
essential role in directing movements in such situations. This system stores the position of an object in the
visual world and can be used to direct a movement to engage it. This is an internally driven movement. In
contrast, we make so-called externally cued movement when the object is visible at the time of movement. To
make movements accurate in both situations, visuospatial working memory and the visual signal need to be
appropriately transformed to a motor command signal.
 The mechanism that maintains the motor accuracy is called motor adaptation. The behavioral
characteristics and neural mechanisms of motor adaptation for an externally cued movement are well
understood, however, little is known about motor adaptation of an internally driven movement. Do adaptations
for both types of movement engage the same neural mechanism? If they are different, how are they different in
their behavioral characteristics and neural mechanisms, and do they interact?
 We will use saccadic eye movements to study motor adaptation. Saccades, rapid eye movements that direct
the gaze to targets of interest, can be induced by an external visual signal (visually-guided saccade, VGS) or
by an internal visuospatial working memory (memory-guided saccade, MGS). Also, saccades are very precise.
Because saccades remain accurate throughout life, despite the neural and muscular changes due to aging or
injury, the saccadic system must be continually recalibrated through saccade adaptation.
 When we examined the VGS after MGS adaptation, VGS remained unchanged. Therefore, we hypothesize
that the neural mechanism for MGS adaptation is distinct from that for VGS adaptation. In this project, we
propose to investigate the adaptation of MGS and compare it with that of VGS.
 The main innovation of this study is that it could reveal a yet unknown motor adaptation mechanism for
internally driven movement. The innovative concept is that the neural basis of motor adaptation for internally
and externally driven movements could be separate but interact. Understanding the neuronal basis of motor
adaptation for both externally and internally driven movements will provide a comprehensive picture of motor
adaptation."

This Program Project grant has unveiled key roles for macrophage metabolism, depot- and cue-dependent
molecular re-programming and intraorgan communications in cardiometabolic dysfunction. The Program Project
team will build upon these discoveries and forge new directions. Macrophages mediate intraorgan
communications and, through interorgan communications, macrophages and other bioactive mediators home to
and infiltrate distinct sites, such as in the atherosclerotic plaque; in obese adipose tissue; and to be newly
explored in this Cycle; in the liver. In cardiometabolic dysfunction, the liver is the recipient of increased endotoxin
from the gut; accumulation of lipid from adipose tissue; and increased bioavailability of damage-associated
molecular patterns. In each metabolic organ, the tissue-specific niche defines the myriad consequences, such
as excess synthesis/deposition of pathological lipids; and recruitment of infiltrating bone marrow-derived immune
cells. These delivered stimuli modulate endogenous signaling pathways in resident adipose tissue macrophages
and liver Kupffer cells and impart immunometabolic imprints on macrophage subsets in atherosclerosis, obesity
and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). These concepts are clinically-significant, as atherosclerosis, obesity
and NASH are established risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. The Program Project will explore three
specific aims: First, Aim 1 (Project 1) will determine the mechanisms by which caloric restriction mediates
macrophage intra- and interorgan communications in atherosclerosis, obesity and NASH, and define the impact
of LXRÎ± phosphorylation in liver immune cells on NASH-related factors under study in each Project. Second,
Aim 2 (Project 2) will probe the mechanisms by which netrin-1 and its receptor network mediate macrophage
intra- and interorgan communications in atherosclerosis, obesity and NASH. Third, Aim 3 (Project 3) will probe
the mechanisms by which RAGE/DIAPH1 mediates macrophage intra- and interorgan communications in
atherosclerosis, obesity and NASH. The Program Project will be supported by three cores: Core A
(Administrative, which includes Biostatistics and Bioinformatics); Core B (Pathology and Biochemistry); and Core
C (Mouse Breeding and Procedure Core). Collectively, this highly-motivated Program Project team continues to
work together synergistically to interrogate novel mechanisms by which macrophage intraorgan and interorgan
communications contribute to the mediation and remediation of cardiometabolic disease. Through the
employment of state-of-the-art approaches and shared complementary examinations in human tissues and
human transcriptome databases, this Program Project will discover new mechanistic insights that lead to
therapeutic approaches to quench the exaggerated macrophage accumulation, inflammation and
intra/interorgan communications that amplify cardiovascular risk."
10829909,"Neuromodulation modalities, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can induce long-term
plastic changes and selectively alter functional network connectivity which in turn may improve symptoms in
Alzheimerâs disease (AD). However, despite the wide application of rTMS in humans, the mechanisms
underlying rTMS-induced plasticity in healthy aging and AD remain uncertain. Preliminary evidence from one
study with cognitively normal older adults suggests that rTMS can modulate dynamics in a cortical-
hippocampal network known as the default mode network (DMN), which is impaired in AD. Yet there is a
critical need for replication of these effects. Furthermore, because none of the prior studies measured amyloid
beta, it is still unknown whether rTMS is effective in cognitively normal adults with elevated cerebral amyloid
(preclinical AD). Our preliminary data in a single patient with AD pathology also show that rTMS may improve
abnormalities in the impaired brain network. While these findings are encouraging, we need more evidence
regarding the mechanisms through which rTMS alters network function, and the durability of these effects over
time. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine whether there are differences in the modulation
of brain network function by rTMS in AD compared to healthy aging. This proposal is being submitted in
response to PAR 22-094 and NOT-AG-21-039 to characterize neural circuitry mechanisms underlying
brain plasticity in AD in the context of the aging brain. We propose to conduct a within-subjects experiment
using rTMS administration for 10 days in 15 cognitively unimpaired older adults with no evidence of AD
biomarkers (AÎ²-), 15 amyloid positive (AÎ²+) cognitively normal older adults (preclinical AD) and 15 patients
with prodromal AD (AÎ²+ and a clinical diagnosis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment) who have already
undergone PET imaging through separately funded studies. We will use baseline functional connectivity MRI to
target the left lateral parietal node of the DMN . Our central hypothesis is that rTMS targeting the DMN will
improve functional network integrity. We will pursue three specific aims: 1) establish the effects of rTMS on
neural plasticity in preclinical AD, 2) establish the effects of rTMS on neural plasticity in prodromal AD and 3)
identify the aging- and AD-related biological features that predict whether neural plasticity can be induced by
rTMS. Outcomes will be measures of DMN functional connectivity immediately and 1 week and 2 weeks after
stimulation. We will aos use amyloid and tau PET scans (acquired through another study) with structural
markers of neurodegeneration to quantify the impact of AD pathology and atrophy on rTMS-induced plasticity.
Our approach is innovative because it focuses on the relationship between AD pathophysiological changes
and rTMS-induced plasticity. The proposed research is significant because it will better elucidate whether
and how rTMS improves brain function in preclinical and prodromal AD and who is most likely to benefit from
rTMS. A long-term goal is to use these data to plan a future clinical trial with behavioral outcomes in AD."
10620188,"Background: Lonelinessâa subjective emotional state characterized by the perception of social isolationâis
a psychosocial factor that is associated with increased mortality, substance use, and is associated with
precipitants of relapse among individuals with substance use disorders (SUD). Importantly, there are effective
interventions that can be used to decrease loneliness; however, these have not been tested on Veterans with
SUD who are lonely.
Significance/Impact: Individuals with SUD have higher prevalence of loneliness and loneliness exacerbates
pain and sleep disturbance, risk factors of relapse. Without effectively intervening on loneliness, Veterans with
SUD will continue to be at high risk of relapse and will maintain problems engaging with social support,
including healthcare providersâfactors critical for recovery. Cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) has shown
the strongest effects on loneliness, however, there are no interventions that are specifically designed for
substance using populations who are lonely. Testing CBT for loneliness and SUD (CBT-L/SUD) has the
potential to have a broad impact on addressing a critical, unmet need that commonly affects Veterans with
SUD. Our approach of national recruitment and telehealth delivery of this intervention highlights how this this
study address VHA care priorities including substance use, access to care, and telehealth.
Innovation: There are no studies that have tested a loneliness intervention in Veterans with SUD who are
lonely, which may neglect a broader impact on mental and physical health. This study is ideally situated to
generate new and important knowledge on the association of loneliness and SUD. This study seeks to address
a transdiagnostic factor, which may improve engagement with social support thereby reducing substance use.
An additional innovative aspect of this study is recruitment being conducted outside the VHA. This may
increase access to care among those Veterans who are especially isolated.
Specific Aims: We aim to: (1) refine the CBT-L/SUD manual by conducting a one-arm trial among Veterans
with a SUD who report loneliness (n = 6), (2) randomize participants to receive either CBT-L/SUD (n = 15) or
CBT-SUD (n = 15) to assess feasibility and acceptability among Veterans with a SUD who report loneliness.
Methodology: We will elicit feedback on a draft of the CBT-L/SUD manual then conduct a small single-arm
trial (n = 6) for further refinement. Specifically, SUD treatment providers and Veterans with SUD will provide
feedback on the draft manual, which the research team will integrate to finalize the manual for a small single-
arm trial. This trial will allow us to collect feasibility of treatment delivery, and treatment satisfaction and
acceptability data to further refine the manual. With the refined manual Veterans with SUD reporting loneliness
will be randomized to either CBT-L/SUD (n = 15) or CBT-SUD (n = 15). We will assess: (1) treatment
acceptability, (2) participant adherence to treatment, and (3) therapist fidelity. We will also assess outcome
measure completion percentage, means and standard deviations, and level of correlation of repeated
measurement of primary loneliness outcomes and secondary substance use outcomes.
Implementation/Next Steps: Results from this study will provide critical feasibility and acceptability data to
inform an HSR&D Merit Award application to conduct a fully-powered randomized controlled trial. The
research team will work with the VA Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention and the Substance Use
Disorder office of the National Mental Health Program to identify implementation and dissemination efforts. For
example, we plan to translate findings into applied practice across various settings (e.g., primary care mental
health, rehabilitation treatment programs). Additionally, this intervention may be particularly useful for
behavioral telehealth centers that deliver evidence-based interventions to rural and other Veterans who have
difficulty accessing VHA care."

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. This renewal application for years 11-15 of our
Program Project Grant entitled âMechanisms of Ethnic/Racial Differences in Lung Cancer Due to Cigarette
Smokingâ brings together our team of renowned experts in cancer molecular epidemiology, tobacco control,
mechanisms and biochemistry of tobacco carcinogenesis, and biostatistics to continue our groundbreaking
research on biochemical, molecular, and epigenetic mechanisms by which cigarette smoking causes lung
cancer. We will build on our significant findings from ongoing studies which include important advances in the
epigenetics of lung cancer, biochemistry of nicotine leading to addiction and cancer, DNA damage by tobacco
smoke carcinogens including acrolein and 1,3-butadiene, and tobacco carcinogen biomarker studies which
expand and explain the dramatic differences in lung cancer incidence among cigarette smokers from 5 ethnic
groups â African Americans, Native Hawaiians, Whites, Latinos, and Japanese Americans. Project 1, âGenetic
and epigenetic risk markers for lung cancer in former smokersâ proposes to identify these markers of lung
cancer risk in people who have quit smoking and improve our understanding of the ethnic/racial differences in
lung cancer risk among former smokers. Project 2, âCYP2A6 genetic score, nicotine metabolism, and lung
cancerâ will focus on the primary catalyst of nicotine metabolism which is critical because people with low
activity of this enzyme smoke fewer cigarettes and smoke those less intensely because they need less
nicotine, which is proposed to lead to lower lung cancer risk. Project 3, âUntargeted adductomics to
characterize ethnic differences in the exposome of smokersâ hypothesizes that biological responses towards
cigarette smoke exposure differ among individuals and ethnic groups due to genetic and/or epigenetic factors
that lead to differences in metabolic and inflammatory responses to smoking. Project 4, âCarcinogenesis
biomarkers in former smokers of the Multiethnic Cohort Studyâ will use a unique approach to determine the
metabolic activation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as well as lipid peroxidation in the lungs of former
smokers compared to never smokers. These 4 projects will be supported by 3 outstanding Cores:
Administrative Core, Clinical and Biomarkers Core, and Biostatistics Core. Thus, our experienced investigators
propose to continue their superb and unique teamwork to make significant progress in understanding lung
cancer mechanisms among present and former cigarette smokers leading to new insights for prevention of
fatal lung cancer."
10861801,"SUMMARY
Lung cancer is the leading cancer killer in the United States. Our team proposes to develop novel personalized
therapeutic strategies by exploiting vulnerabilities and opportunities created by alterations in tumor suppressors
in lung cancer. Specifically, we focus on the tumor suppressor LKB1, which is one of the most commonly mutated
genes in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD); LKB1 mutations are detected in 15-25% of LUAD, representing a major
subpopulation of lung cancer patients. Despite the frequency, upward trajectory of incidence, and aggressive
nature of disease, patients with LKB1-mutant LUAD not only have no targeted therapeutics available, but also
show poor response to immune checkpoint inhibitors, demanding urgent development of effective therapeutic
options. To address this critical gap, our revised application will capitalize on our integrated understanding of
LKB1-lossâevoked tumor growth regulatory mechanisms and suppression of anticancer immunity to develop
innovative clinical approaches for the treatment of patients with LKB1-mutant LUAD. New preliminary data from
our team showed that 1) LKB1 loss allows metabolic dysregulation, such as glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)
activation by FAK, leading to increased regulatory T cells and immune suppression; 2) LKB1-loss-triggered
inhibition of STING, a key innate immunity regulator, can be reversed by an IAP inhibitor, leading to reactivated
immune response and its potent in vivo immune-dependent anticancer effect; and 3) FAK is activated in LKB1-
deficient cancer cells and supports cell invasion and inhibits immune infiltration. These results lead to our central
hypothesis that mutated LKB1 may exert its immune suppression function through a dysregulated anti-cancer
immunity cycle mediated by key metabolic, innate immunity, and stromal regulatory factors. Targeting these
factors may lead to novel approaches to re-activate anticancer immunity for effective therapeutic development
in LUAD. We will address this hypothesis through three highly integrated Projects. Project 1 will examine the role
of the FAK-GDH1 axis in immunotherapy resistance and tumor progression of LKB1-mutant LUAD. Project 2
will exploit our recently discovered LKB1-regulated IAP-JAK-STING signaling in LUAD to reverse immune
suppression with an IAP inhibitor to enhance immunotherapy effect. Project 3 will focus on targeting FAK-
mediated primary tumor progression in LKB1-mutant LUAD by performing a clinical trial with the combination of
a FAK inhibitor and an immune checkpoint inhibitor coupled with mechanistic studies. The projects are supported
by three cores, whose functions are administrative (Core 1), molecular pathology and immunology (Core 2), and
bioinformatics and biostatistics (Core 3). This highly integrated effort builds on new discoveries from our
established lung cancer team with more than 100 co-publications and with strong institutional support. We expect
to advance lung cancer treatment strategies by new agent discovery (GDH1 inhibitors), new application of clinical
stage IAP inhibitors, and a new phase II clinical trial of a FAK-targeted combination approach to overcome
immunotherapy resistance of LKB1-mutant LUAD and bring treatment options to this patient population."

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a common neurodegenerative cause of early age-of-onset dementia. The
behavioral variant of FTD (bvFTD) results in profound changes in personality, as well as social and emotional
functioning. Diagnostic uncertainty remains a common concern in bvFTD in spite of improved diagnostic
criteria that focus on particular behavioral and cognitive features accompanied by characteristic neuroimaging
patterns. Accurate diagnoses at the first visit are especially challenging, when cognitive impairment can be
mild and functional abilities are more preserved. Other dementia syndromes can mimic features of bvFTD and
there is partial overlap with the symptoms of psychiatric illnesses. With the clarity provided by longitudinal
follow-up clinicians sometimes change bvFTD diagnoses. There are over 15 potential neuropathological
diagnoses that underlie bvFTD. Even when a bvFTD diagnosis is clear it is challenging to predict the specific
molecular subtype causing an individual patientâs symptoms. There is substantial heterogeneity in the clinical
course in bvFTD as well, with some declining rapidly within 2-3 years and others surviving over more than a
decade. Motor features may be present or absent, and their severity in the context of bvFTD can impact the
level of care a patient requires. There are few reliable indicators to prognosticate a patientâs disease course.
The proposed research will study 60 patients with bvFTD longitudinally with neurological examinations,
cognitive testing, and structural and functional neuroimaging, and will retrospectively review the clinical
features of 284 autopsied patients with bvFTD. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that in spite of the
similarities between patients with bvFTD there will be clinical, neuropsychological, neuroimaging, serum
marker, genetic, and gene expression differences that permit improved predictive certainty at the first visit. In
Aim 1 we will use longitudinal assessment of diagnostic stability in order to determine factors that predict
certainty in the bvFTD diagnosis. In Aim 2 we will identify clinical, gene expression, and imaging profiles in a
cohort of autopsied patients with bvFTD that allow accurate prediction of a patientâs pathological diagnosis. In
Aim 3 we will use longitudinal data on patients with bvFTD to determine factors that allow accurate
prognostication of the clinical course. The results of the proposed research will provide guidance to clinicians
who are considering a diagnosis of bvFTD and will improve the diagnostic and prognostic information available
to patients, families, and clinicians, leading to improved clinical care from the time of the first visit. It will also
facilitate enrollment of patients into observational research and molecularly targeted clinical trials."

The long-term clinical impact of war-time injuries remains incompletely described 1,2. Previous studies have
been based largely on self-report and screening tools 3-6 to define TBI, rather than direct clinical assessments in
cohorts identified at the time of injury and prospectively studied. As part of our prior efforts, we have
successfully completed prospective, observational, longitudinal studies enrolling active-duty US military directly
in the combat theatre in Afghanistan and following medical evacuation to Landstuhl, Germany at 0-7 days
(median 4) 17,18, 0-30 days (median 7-9) 19,20, and 0-90 days (median 14) 21-23 post-injury with evaluation at 1-
year 18-22 and 5-year 24,25 outcome to date. We remain the only study to date that has prospectively followed
active-duty US military from concussive brain injury directly in combat to long-term outcome with advanced MR
imaging and clinical evaluation. We will leverage this well characterized cohort in the current proposal to
investigate the long-term effects of mild-concussive traumatic brain injury (TBI) sustained during deployment in
US military personnel using advanced MR imaging and clinical outcome measures. We will relate these
findings to the prospectively acquired longitudinal imaging and clinical data from the acute, sub-acute, and
early chronic stages following combat concussion collected on these subjects as part of our prior efforts. We
hypothesize that combat concussion will differentially impact service members and that we will be able to
identify those at high risk of continued decline verses those with a trajectory of recovery by leveraging the
extensive early clinical and imaging data already collected in these very same patients linking it to the planned
10-year evaluation.
Specific Aim #1: Assess 10-year neurological, neuropsychological, and psychiatric clinical outcomes of
combat concussion in US military personnel leveraging previously acquired longitudinal data to identify
predictors of long-term clinical outcome.
Specific Aim #2: Examine 10-year advanced neuroimaging data in service members following combat
concussion in US military personnel leveraging previously acquired longitudinal data to identify predictors of
long-term imaging outcome.
Specific Aim #3: Explore functional trajectories over this first decade post-injury using latent growth models to
understand evolution or resolution of mental health symptoms, cognitive function, neurobehavioral symptoms
and neuroimaging measures following combat concussion."
10656589,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Sudden-onset injuriesâsuch as acquired injuries or insults to the brain, spinal cord, and major
extremitiesâbegin in an instant and typically cannot be reversed. While there is potential for varying degrees
of physical, functional, psychosocial, and/or cognitive recovery with rehabilitation, these injuries often result in
life-long and life-altering disabilities. Furthermore, many such injuries occur in individuals who are young,
active, and otherwise healthy. With the approximately 2.58 million new injuries to the brain, spine, or limb that
occur each year, and an estimated 14.45 million individuals living in the U.S. with long-term disabilities related
to these conditions, sudden-onset injuries are some of the most common causes of morbidity in the U.S. Given
the invaluable opportunity to improve outcomes for such a large number of individuals, there is a vital need to
better understand the complex patterns of symptoms experienced by these individuals in the long term to
inform high-quality clinical care. Symptom clustering science offers an ideal method to achieve this goal.
 This projectâs broad, long-term objective is to understand the complex patterns of symptoms displayed after
acquired injuries to the brain, spine, or limb, so that clinical care can be improved. Symptom clustering has
proven useful as a strategy for personalized medicine with complex medical conditions, such as cancer.
However, there are several significant gaps in the literature, including the need to expand these methods to
other clinical groups, define the characteristics of symptom clusters, identify instruments and metrics for
measuring symptom clusters, and apply novel analytic strategies for detecting symptom clusters.
 This work will leverage over a decade of the investigatorsâ prior qualitative and quantitative work on several
large, multi-site studies with these clinical populations. In particular, existing data sets will be reanalyzed using
new symptom clustering techniques. Results from these new analyses will be used to identify and characterize
the most important symptom clusters for individuals with acquired disabilities. Then, a new, more diverse
sample of individuals with acquired injuries to the brain, spine, or limb will be collected and evaluated to
examine the generalizability and stability of these symptom clusters for use within and across rehabilitation
populations. Last, the findings will be used to generate guidelines and clinical tools to translate symptom
clusters into clinical practice.
 This work will be accomplished through four aims. Aim 1: Identify transdiagnostic and condition-specific
symptom clusters present in individuals with traumatic injuries. Aim 2: Explore the generalizability and
reproducibility of the symptom clusters identified in Aim 1 in a diverse sample of individuals with acquired
disabilities. Aim 3: Examine longitudinally the stability and predictive utility of symptom clusters in a diverse
sample of individuals with acquired disabilities. Aim 4: Develop guidelines and clinical tools for assessing and
interpreting symptom clusters in individuals with acquired disabilities."
10817734,"Overall: Summary
 From the moment of fertilization to birth, the maternal immune system evolves, adapts, and supports the
growth of a fetal allograft that ultimately perpetuates the human race. Immunological changes throughout a
pregnancy play a key deterministic role in the success of the pregnancy. While pregnancy was historically
regarded as a simple shift towards tolerance, emerging immunological data point to remarkable dynamic
changes during pregnancy. The pregnancy immunome must protect the fetus from a maternal attack while at
the same time it must afford the maternal-fetal dyad protection from invading pathogens. The health of the mother
and the fetus requires that these two opposing immunological tasks work in concert. Thus collectively, pregnancy
marks a whirlwind of immune adaptations that render the pregnant immune system a truly unique immunologic
marvel. Despite our growing appreciation for these highly controlled dynamic shifts, the precise mechanisms that
lead to optimal pregnancy health, profoundly impacting both mother and fetus, are incompletely understood,
delaying the development of targeted therapies for this population. Capitalizing on this unique moment in vaccine
history, with the introduction of several novel-vaccine platforms for SARS-CoV-2, the consortium will build a
Pregnancy Immune Atlas via the application of high-density immunological profiling technologies to deeply and
comprehensively dissect the overall changes that occur across pregnancy and how the immune system, as a
collective, responds to in vivo perturbations with vaccines. Using both de novo vaccine induced immune
responses and booster vaccination, the consortium will capture overall changes in the pregnant ImmunOME as
well as shifts in the pregnant AdaptOME to fully capture the immunological mechanisms that govern the balanced
growth of the fetus and battle of the maternal:fetal dyad against invading pathogens. Thus, together the Maternal
âOmics to Maximize Immunity (MOMi) consortium seeks to build the foundational data to advance our
knowledge of natural tolerance, fertility, shifts in immunity during pregnancy to better understand this evolutionary
marvel required for the perpetuation of the human species."
10597536,"Background: Rates of sexually transmitted infection (STI), especially gonorrhea and chlamydia, have
increased dramatically over the past decade. Several factors put women Veterans at higher risk for STIs
compared with both non-Veteran women and male Veterans, including substantial rates of exposure to sexual
violence (including military sexual trauma), intimate partner violence, and unsafe behavior associated with
posttraumatic stress and related substance use. Women are also more vulnerable to STI effects, as infection
may be asymptomatic, undetected, and lead to complications. Guideline-recommended STI screening can
detect infection and mitigate negative outcomes, but screening is underutilized.
Significance/Impact: Womenâs health and primary care are priority areas identified by VA/ORD, and the VA
Directive 1330.01 states that facilities are required to provide STI screening and counseling in VA womenâs
health and primary care clinics. However, screening protocols across VA are not well-implemented and
screening rates are suboptimal. To improve screening and outcomes, it is necessary to understand the current
landscape of STI screening in VA.
Innovation: The study is topically innovative because it focuses on a very prevalent but understudied issue
that plays a critical role in womenâs functioning and well-being. Few studies have examined the epidemiology
of STIs in women Veterans and none has assessed health system responses to STIs or examined patterns in
rates of STI screening among women Veterans across patient, provider or practice characteristics. Further,
there is currently very little structural or informational support for providers screening for STIs.
Specific Aims: Use administrative data to examine practice-, provider-, and patient-level correlates of
gonorrhea and chlamydia screening in VA (Aim 1); use qualitative interviews to explore practice-, provider-,
and patient-level barriers and facilitators to STI screening in VA womenâs health and primary care clinics (Aim
2); and use principles of user-centered design to develop a multi-pronged clinical decision support tool to
improve gonorrhea and chlamydia screening for women Veterans in womenâs health and primary care and pilot
test it at VA facilities to assess uptake, usability, and reach (Aim 3).
Methodology: With a mixed-methods approach in Aims 1 & 2, employing quantitative electronic health record
analyses and subsequent qualitative interviews, this proposed CDA will examine correlates of screening and
explore barriers and facilitators to STI screening among women Veterans from both a patient and provider
perspective. These findings will inform Aim 3, the development of a clinical decision support tool employing
user-centered design, a participatory approach that incorporates multiple rounds of stakeholder feedback. The
clinical decision support tool will alert providers to gonorrhea and chlamydia screening needs, support sexual
history-taking and documentation, and raise awareness of screening guidelines to enhance STI management
for women patients across VA. The final tool will be tested in a small feasibility pilot at two VISN 4 facilities to
assess uptake, usability, and reach.
Next Steps/ Implementation: Findings from this study will be augmented by an HSR&D investigator-initiated
research (IIR) proposal in Year 3 to examine women Veteranâs use of non-VA care for GC/CT and inform an
IIR proposal in Year 5 for an effectiveness-implementation trial to test the decision support tool at multiple VA
sites."
10645189,"ABSTRACT
 After undergoing positive selection in the cortex, thymocytes migrate into the medulla where central
tolerance is enforced by antigen presenting cells (APCs) displaying a diverse array of auto-antigens. Dendritic
cells (DCs) and medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) are the two predominant medullary APCs that induce
central tolerance. Collectively, mTECs express the majority of the proteome, but any individual self- antigen is
expressed by only 1-3 % of these cells. Thymic DCs present self-antigens derived not only from their own
proteome, but also those acquired from the blood, from mTECs, and from peripheral tissues. Thus, mTECs
and DCs display a mosaic of self-antigens, which thymocytes must navigate to scan for auto-reactivity. This
process is critical for self-tolerance, as lost expression of even one self-antigen in the thymus can result in
peripheral autoimmunity. In this proposal, we will investigate mechanisms by which the chemokine receptors
CCR4 and CCR7 alter thymocyte localization and interactions with distinct APCs to enforce central tolerance.
 It is well-documented that CCR7 promotes thymocyte medullary localization and thus, negative
selection. Over the last funding period, we identified a critical role for CCR4 in these processes as well. Our
data suggest a novel model in which CCR4 promotes medullary entry of post-positive selection thymocytes
and interactions with DCs, while CCR7 sustains medullary localization of mature thymocytes and promotes
interactions mTECs, to induce negative selection and Treg differentiation of distinct TCR repertoires. In Aim 1,
we will use a combination of 2-photon microscopy, TCR repertoire sequencing, and TCR retrogenic bone
marrow chimeras to test the impact of CCR4 and CCR7 on thymocyte localization, interactions with APCs, and
central tolerance. Notably, we have developed a novel 2-photon microscopy approach to quantify the
contribution of distinct APCs to negative selection, and will expand this approach to identify APCs required for
Treg selection. Our recent data also suggest that both early and late stages of negative selection occur in the
medulla, driven by CCR4 and CCR7, respectively. In Aim 2, we will test this novel model, which contrasts with
the prevailing view that early and late stages of selection occur in the cortex and medulla, respectively. Over
the last funding period, we identified a novel role for CCR7 expression by thymic DCs in regulating Treg
selection. In Aim 3, we will use existing and novel genetic mouse models, functional assays, TCR repertoire
sequencing, and retrogenic bone marrow chimeras to test the hypothesis that CCR7 expression by thymic DCs
promotes their survival and is required for acquisition and display of mTEC-derived self-antigens, thus
impacting repertoire selection. Altogether, the proposed experiments will elucidate mechanisms by which
CCR4 and CCR7 promote central tolerance and will test the innovative model, suggested by our data, that
central tolerance is separated into two stages, first dominated by DC-mediated deletion of less mature
thymocytes, and then by mTEC-mediated deletion of mature thymocytes to ensure self- tolerance."
10673604,"Background: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a comprehensive secondary prevention program involving
exercise training, behavioral activation, and psychosocial support following cardiac events such as myocardial
infarction, coronary revascularization, valve replacement. Randomized clinical trials (RCT) have demonstrated
lower mortality and greater physical, mental, and social functioning in patients who participate in CR vs. usual
care. However, the long-term mortality benefit of CR is directly proportional to the number of sessions
completed, and less than half of Veterans who enroll in CR complete the recommended number of sessions.
Significance: Home-based CR (HBCR) is an alternative to traditional CR programs that has comparable
efficacy in improving morbidity/mortality and increases access to critical services. Improving participation in
home-based CR has been identified as a major priority by the National Director of Cardiology. We propose to
test a novel and easily scalable intervention to increase HBCR adherence and improve functional capacity/
physical activity in Veterans at risk for secondary cardiac events. This project addresses a major quality gap
and aligns closely with VHA Modernization priorities of: a) virtual care/telehealth utilization; b) digital
transformation; and c) MISSION Act implementation by offering high quality, easy to access care.
Innovation and Impact: There is major potential to improve Veteran engagement in CR by combining digital
coaching (d-Coaching) with existing VA-supported technologies. Our theory-based intervention targets a
critical component of successful CR engagement that is not available through traditional programs: virtual
social support through a social network. In addition, we propose to improve self-efficacy and self-regulation
through interactive digital multi-media education, personalized feedback, and motivation so that Veterans can
complete the prescribed HBCR program and maintain physical activity long-term. The innovative features
include: 1) the use of the VA-approved MOVN mobile app to deliver the d-Coaching intervention and provide
peer social networks; 2) interactive tailored messages via Annie text messaging to reinforce Veteran-centered
goals, learning, and support; and 3) optional participation in a Fitbit private group leaderboard.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Determine the effect of the d-Coaching intervention on the number of completed HBCR
sessions over 3 months. Aim 2: Determine the effect of the d-Coaching intervention on: a) functional capacity
(6-minute walk test), b) physical activity (daily step counts, sedentary time), c) psychosocial outcomes
(depressive symptoms, quality of life), and d) clinical outcomes (HbA1C, lipids) and rehospitalization/
mortality. Aim 3: Determine the effect of the d-Coaching intervention on social cognitive factors of self-efficacy,
self-regulation, and perceived social support. Aim 3a: Evaluate the extent to which self-efficacy, self-regulation,
and perceived social support mediate the effect of the intervention on function and physical activity.
Methodology: The VA IMPACT (Improving self-Management of Physical Activity with Cardiac rehabilitation
Training through the digital coaching) RCT will evaluate the effects of HBCR alone (usual care) versus HBCR
+ d-Coaching, including a private social networking group, optimized Annie text messaging, VA Video
Connect, and connected devices (Fitbits). We will randomly assign 150 Veterans from 2 HBCR programs to a
3-month intervention with repeated-measures outcome assessments for 12 months. The addition of d-
Coaching to existing digital technologies will be operationalized by applying health technology to provide social
support, education, personalized feedback, and motivation for patients enrolled in HBCR.
Next Steps/Implementation: Leveraging digital technologies is advantageous because of their low cost,
scalability, availability across multiple settings (e.g., rural), potential for individual tailoring, and opportunities for
real-time modification. Assuming the proposed study demonstrates benefit for the d-Coaching intervention, we
plan to implement and disseminate it across all VA facilities with HBCR programs."
10814979,"PROJECT SUMMARY â HERCULES: EXPOSOME RESEARCH CENTER
The Emory Human Exposome Research Center Understanding Lifetime ExposureS (HERCULES)
Environmental Health Core Center has an overarching vision to serve as an intellectual hub in the
advancement and translation of exposome research to improve human health. Our vision is shaped by a
charge to enhance and extend environmental health research, foster innovation and collaboration, engage with
communities and stakeholders, and support research translation to accelerate impact. HERCULES employs
the framework of the exposome, defined as the totality of exposures, biological responses and societal factors
experienced across a lifespan, which impact the environment experienced by an individual. HERCULES
Members comprise 71 researchers from 24 departments at Emory University and the Georgia Institute of
Technology, connected by a shared mission of learning how the exposome affects health and community well-
being and using that knowledge to improve human health. The overarching goals of the Center are to a)
innovate in the tools, application, and data science of exposome research, b) promote and grow translational
environmental health research at Emory and Georgia Tech, and c) strengthen and expand partnerships with
metro Atlanta area communities to enhance their ability to assess their exposome and respond to their
environmental health priorities. To achieve these goals, HERCULES supports an Integrated Health Sciences
Facilities Core, which operationalizes the exposome concept within a targeted analysis facility, an untargeted
high resolution metabolomics facility, and translational research unit, as well as an Environmental Health
Data Sciences Core to enable and interpret multidimensional exposomic output, providing an ecosystem of
data sciences services. The Community Engagement Core serves to define and apply exposomics through
bi-directional interactions with community groups and stakeholders and leads a program of community
engagement and support. Our highly successful Pilot Project Program innovates exposome research, with
priorities on early career investigators, translational, and community-engaged research through both larger
traditional pilots and smaller, time-sensitive awards. The Centerâs Administrative Core coordinates activities
and communication and uses evaluation to ensure that the Centerâs goals are achieved. A career development
program also will support targeted early career investigators recruited to Emory and the Center and will provide
support for both early career and established investigators to develop new skills or research directions. In its
vision, aims, and diverse community of members and stakeholders, HERCULES serves as the home to
environmental health research at Emory University, Georgia Tech, and the metro Atlanta area, providing
infrastructure, scientific leadership, and collaborative resources for our members to develop and implement
innovative exposome research and improve human health."
10827366,"Project Summary
The ATM kinase is central to the DNA damage response; it follows that this large kinase is central to regulating
how developing lymphocytes respond to their self-imposed DNA damage during VDJ recombination. Although
the evidence is overwhelming and unequivocal that ATM contributes to accurate non-homologous end joining of
VDJ coding segments, and restrains their participation in genomic translocations, a clear mechanistic
understanding of how ATM actually does this job is lacking.
Recently, we found that ATM ablation in many cultured cell strains results in increased VDJ joining in episomal
assays, a completely counter-intuitive result if ATM were to have a direct functional role in end joining. We
considered that if ATM's role was instead, to regulate the RAG post cleavage complex(s), loss of ATM might
result in increased release of VDJ recombination intermediates and more rapid joining, explaining the increased
recombination observed. We fine-tuned the assay so that a structure/function, reductionist approach could be
employed to delineate if and how ATM directly affects the RAG complex. We find that ATM inhibition of signal
joining requires the non-core C-termini of both RAG1 and RAG2. This prompted an examination of these regions
for potential ATM/DNA-PK target sites. Blocking these sites not only blocks ATM's effect on signal joining in
cellular assays, it also ablates robust phosphorylation of RAG1/RAG2 on highly purified and fully functional RAG
complexes by ATM and DNA-PK in vitro. These data support our model that ATM directly regulates VDJ
recombination by phosphorylation of the RAG complex. The experiments proposed in this application will use
biochemical approaches to define how ATM affects cleavage and signal end release, and will use a cellular
model of chromosomal VDJ recombination to further define how ATM regulates VDJ recombination."
10641727,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The lungs and upper airways are mucosal surfaces that are regularly exposed to the external
environment. Like other mucosal surfaces in the body (e.g. intestines, and female reproductive
tract) proper functioning of the lungs and airways requires avoidance of chronic inflammation. The
pathways underlying immune homeostasis and tolerance to exogenous stimuli at mucosal
surfaces are complex, diverse and poorly understood. During the last funding period, our studies
have identified different molecular pathways regulated by the transcription factor Blimp1 (encoded
by the Prdm1 gene) that promote immune homeostasis in the intestinal mucosa and potentially
other mucosal surfaces such as the lungs. We have discovered that Blimp1 is specifically
expressed in a subset of regulatory T lymphocytes in the intestines and that expression of Blimp1
in these cells is required to maintain their regulatory properties and prevent acquisition of
inflammatory properties. In addition, our studies revealed that lack of Blimp1 in T cells is
associated with increased expression of the inflammatory cytokine IL9 and worsened airway
inflammation. During the funding period of the award we generated a new knock-in Blimp1
reporter mouse that allowed visualization of Blimp1 expression in hematopoietic cells at the
steady state in different tissues, including environmental surfaces. The new finding that led us to
form the basis for this renewal application was the observation that Blimp1 is constitutively
expressed in lung resident alveolar macrophages at higher levels than the observed in other
myeloid cells in the lung and in other tissues. More importantly, we found that deletion of Blimp1
in macrophages in mice compromised the response against the pneumoniae-causing bacteria
Streptococcus pneumoniae, leading to exacerbated inflammatory responses, worsened lung
tissue damage and increased bacterial burden. Moreover, we identified MHC class II and the
regulatory molecules CD200R1 and IL10 as putative targets of Blimp1 in lung macrophages.
Together, these observations led to our hypothesis that Blimp1 functions as critical regulator to
maintain immune homeostasis in the lungs by restraining inflammatory activity of both lymphoid
and myeloid cells. In this proposal we will define the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which
Blimp1 promote immune homeostasis in the lung. We anticipate that achievement of the goals of
this application will uncover novel mechanisms underlying control of immune response and
tolerance in the lungs and will inform the development of new therapeutic approaches to treat
chronic lung inflammatory conditions."
10647659,"Project Summary
This project aims to re-purpose the safe and well-tolerated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue
Lupron for use in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Lupron is currently FDA-approved for prostate cancer,
endometriosis and uterine fibroids in adults and for central precocious puberty in children. We propose to
confirm and extend results from a prior phase II study (Bowen et al, 2015) that demonstrated that Lupron
halted cognitive and functional decline in a subgroup of women with mild-moderate AD who were also taking
an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI). Our objectives are to replicate, in the same subgroup, Lupron's
clinical EFFICACY in this prior trial and to add neuroimaging and plasma BIOMARKERS that will help elucidate
Lupron's likely multiple mechanisms of action in AD. These mechanisms include decreasing levels of
Luteinizing Hormone (LH) based on extensive preclinical evidence that decreasing LH preserves cognition and
decreases amyloid deposition and tau phosphorylation in animal models of AD, as well as new evidence that
GnRH analogues may have important anti-inflammatory effects.
We will (1) Conduct a three site, double-blind, randomized trial of Lupron (22.5 mg/12 weeks) compared with
placebo to evaluate the changes over 48 weeks in cognition and function in women with mild-moderate AD
who are also taking a stable dose of AChEI. We hypothesize that patients taking Lupron + AChEI will show a
smaller pre- to post-treatment decline in cognition and function when compared to patients taking placebo +
AChEI. (2) We will assess Lupronâs effect on structural and functional (ASL-MRI) neuroimaging biomarkers of
AD. We hypothesize that patients who receive Lupron + AChEI will demonstrate less atrophy in AD-related
brain regions and preserved hippocampal perfusion as compared to those who receive placebo + AChEI. (3)
We will assess changes in plasma markers of inflammation. We hypothesize that patients taking Lupron +
AChEI, as compared to those taking placebo + AChEI, will show decreased plasma pro-inflammatory
cytokines.
If this second phase II trial of Lupron + AChEI for AD is positive we will proceed to a phase III trial with the goal
of gaining FDA approval for this novel combination therapy for AD. By re-purposing an existing medication, in
combination with a current AD treatment, we will be able to build upon extensive previous research and
development efforts, reducing the time frame and costs of making this promising therapy available to patients
with AD. Results from this project have the potential for significant, near term clinical impact in patients
currently suffering from or at risk of AD."
10616675,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Osteoporotic fractures affect >1.4 million U.S. postmenopausal women annually, and contribute to loss of
independence and mortality. This study aims to establish a foundation that will ultimately allow us to address a
potentially paradigm-changing question: should we prevent fast bone mineral density (BMD) decline during the
menopause transition (MT) and early postmenopause (before substantial BMD decline has occurred) to reduce
the risk of subsequent fractures?
 The MT and early postmenopause may be opportune times for early, short-term intervention because
increased bone turnover and negative balance between bone resorption and formation contribute to fast BMD
decline, damage to bone microarchitecture and risk of fracture. However, before we can test the efficacy of
early intervention, we must surmount a critical barrier: we have to be able to predict whether a woman in her
40s to 50s is at risk for fast BMD decline and fracture during the MT and early postmenopause.
 The overarching objective of this study is to tackle this barrier by examining whether a novel bone balance
index (BBI) that combines individual bone resorption and formation to non-invasively estimate bone balance,
can predict fast BMD decline and fracture. We will conduct this study in the Study of Women's Health Across
the Nation (SWAN). From SWAN, we previously created a proof-of-concept BBI using bone turnover markers
that are no longer recommended for clinical research. This BBI was a stronger predictor of BMD decline than a
bone resorption marker alone.
 Here, we will further develop the BBI construct, in an effort to maximize its ability to predict BMD decline
and fracture. We propose to access banked serum collected from SWAN participants during the MT and early
postmenopause to measure currently acknowledged reference bone resorption (serum collagen type I C-
telopeptide [s-CTX]) and formation (serum procollagen type I propeptide [s-PINP]) markers. We will then
recreate our BBI using s-CTX and s-PINP. Aim 1 will characterize how s-CTX, s-PINP, and BBI (created from
s-CTX and s-PINP) change during the MT and early postmenopause. Aim 2 will examine the ability of BBI and
s-CTX to predict fast BMD decline. Aim 3 will examine the ability of BBI and s-CTX to predict future fracture.
 These aims will lay the foundation for developing a tool that combines BBI with clinical risk factors (similar
to adding BMD to clinical risk factors in FRAX) to identify women who may benefit from early intervention, and
thus pave the way for clinical trials testing the efficacy of early, short-term, preventive intervention. This
program of investigation could ultimately contribute to a shift in the way that we prevent fracture: targeting high-
risk women in their 40s-50s prior to substantial BMD decline."
10392435,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Recent studies suggest high ambient temperatures increase the risk of preterm birth (<37 completed weeks of
gestation), a leading cause of infant mortality and long-term neurological disabilities. Infants born early term
(37-38 weeks) also have more morbidity compared to full term births. Under climate projections, heat waves
are expected to increase in frequency, intensity, and duration, and many will cause increases in ambient air
pollutant concentrations. The proposed research seeks to use large existing databases and robust
methodological approaches at multiple spatial scales to test the overarching hypothesis that extreme heat
events increase the risk of preterm birth and early term birth, with stronger associations hypothesized to be
observed following heat events of longer duration and greater intensity. Using national birth record data from
the National Center for Health Statistics, we will assess these relationships in 114 large U.S. cities (covering
54% of the population) at a county-level spatial resolution over a 36-year period (1981-2016). We will
additionally obtain birth record data from eight populous and geographically representative U.S. states
(covering 40% of the population) over the period 1990-2016 to assess relationships at ZIP code or finer
resolution and to examine possible mediation of heat wave associations by accompanying changes in air
pollution levels. Meteorology will be characterized by integrating hourly data from multiple weather station
networks and satellite-resources, harnessing the strengths of each dataset to maximize spatial and temporal
coverage and minimize exposure prediction error. Ambient concentrations of 12 pollutants for the eight
selected states will be also characterized by combining Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (CMAQ)
outputs with monitor measurements. The statistical models for preterm and early term birth will account for
seasonal patterns of conception (a possible source of bias in previous studies), and two-stage analyses using
Bayesian hierarchical models will be used to combine information across study locations and assess
heterogeneity by climate region, timing of the heat event (within season or across decades), maternal
characteristics (educational attainment, race/ethnicity), and location-specific attributes (e.g., contextual
socioeconomic indicators, air conditioning prevalence, urbanicity). Precise estimation of this heterogeneity is
possible due to the exceptionally large sample, which also allows for examination of heat events defined using
higher intensity and duration thresholds than previously assessed. The multi-scale approach facilitates
assessment and propagation of uncertainty due to exposure prediction errors, spatial aggregation, and
residential mobility during pregnancy. Results can be used to inform local public health warning systems such
as heat advisories that target pregnant women with the ultimate goal of reducing early birth and its sequelae.
The study will also yield lasting benefits for future studies of climate and health through the creation of an
integrated, spatial and temporally-resolved, publically-available meteorology dataset for the continental U.S."
10852804,"Project Summary
 The inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) protein has emerged as a promising
therapeutic treatment for several types of cancers. However, the current classes of PARP1 inhibitors are all
derivatives of nicotinamide, based on the strategy of competitive binding against nicotinamide. Because the
PARP1-catalyzed PARylation is critical for many cellular processes, therapeutic targeting of PARP1 in
cancerous cells with current classes of PARP1 inhibitors could negatively affect many cell functions in normal
cells. There is an urgent clinical need for improving the inhibitor specificity for PARP1 and lowering the off-
target effects and toxicity for better therapeutic value and modalities. However, the rapid recruitment of
PARP1 to sites of DNA lesions (within milliseconds) and the vigorously synthesized PAR chains make it
difficult to elucidate the precise stimulatory and regulatory mechanisms on PARP1 activation. We recently
discovered that Src-associated-substrate-during-mitosis-of-68kDa (Sam68) plays an important role in
stimulating the DNA damage-specific PARP1 activation, which suggests that targeting the Sam68-stimulated
PARP1 activation could be a novel strategy to develop a new category of PARP1 inhibitors. The objective of
our research is to identify specific molecule inhibitors of the Sam68-stimulated PARP1 activation via a high
throughput screening, and our hypothesis is that these inhibitors would alleviate DNA damage-triggered
PARP1 activation thus being potential pharmacological agents for treating cancers. We have developed a
novel ELISA-based assay suitable for screening of small molecule libraries. In this proposed research, we will
conduct high throughput screening to identify small molecule compounds inhibiting the Sam68-stimulated
PARP1 activation. We will employ interdisciplinary approach combining biochemical, biophysical, and
molecular experiments, cellular assays, and imaging methods to validate the screening hits and to identify
high quality small molecule inhibitors of Sam68-PARP1 interaction. Activity of the most potent compounds will
be evaluated in a panel of cell-based and mouse model experiments to assess their capability to inhibit the
survival and development of colon cancer cells. Our project represents a very innovative strategy to inhibit
PARP1 activity through blocking the Sam68-conferred stimulatory mechanism. At the conclusion of these
studies, we expect to identify highly valuable compounds that can serve as chemical probes suitable for
further development into potent PARP1 inhibitors for cancer therapeutics. Additionally, discovery of these
inhibitors will greatly facilitate our research on the regulation and function of the Sam68-stimulated PARP1
activation under normal and disease conditions."
10660925,"This proposed Senior Research Career Scientist (SRS) award is to support the activities of Dr.
Matthew Maciejewski, a health economist, Research Career Scientist and an established
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Services Research and Development (HSR&D)
investigator, allowing him expand his scientific, mentoring and service contributions. Dr.
Maciejewskiâs research focuses on improving care and outcomes for Veterans with obesity or
multiple chronic conditions. This research is important because Veterans with obesity or
multiple chronic conditions incur a disproportionate share of VA expenditures and population-
based care models that effectively improve their health and health care are not yet established.
To address these important populations, Dr. Maciejewskiâs research particularly focuses on
conducting quasi-experimental comparative effectiveness research of policies and programs
designed to help Veterans with obesity or multiple chronic conditions. The goal of these
evaluations is to whether existing programs and policies work as intended and which Veterans
realize the greatest benefits from them.
During his 20-year VA career, Dr. Maciejewski obtained HSR&D funding as Principal
Investigator (PI) for 8 IIRs, 2 R01s and 1 R21 from AHRQ, an ongoing R01 from NIDA, 2 RWJ
HCFO grants and contract funding from CMS that is in its 6th year. He has also been a co-
investigator on three dozen other VA and non-VA grants. Dr. Maciejewskiâs studies as PI
helped to develop evidence on the utilization and quality of care for patients who received all or
part of their care at community-based outpatient clinics and impacts of the 2002 VA medication
copayment increase. Mostly importantly, Dr. Maciejewski and his team established evidence on
the long-term outcomes of Veterans receiving bariatric surgery. With NIDA R01 funding, he is
now examining long-term mental health outcomes that have not been widely examined in VA or
non-VA surgical cohorts.
In addition to Dr. Maciejewskiâs research activities, he has served on national and international
committees. Recent activities include service on VA HSR&D grant review panels and co-chair of
the 2016 HSR&D State of the Art Meeting on Weight Management. Currently, Dr. Maciejewski
serves as Chair of Partnered Evidence-Based Policy Resource Centerâs (PEPReC) Technical
Advisory Committee and as co-lead of the Research Data Sustainability Team responsible for
facilitating continuity of administrative and clinical data available for reuse as the VA transitions
to the Cerner EHR. He is a Statistical Associate Editor for JAMA and serves on the editorial
board for HSR. Provision of a VA HSR&D SRS award will allow Dr. Maciejewski to enhance his
research, mentoring and service contributions to the VA HSR&D mission to continue to conduct
of rigorous non-randomized comparative effectiveness studies, increase his participation in local
and national VA committees and train the next generation of health services researchers."
10760203,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Studies to delineate the autoimmune-promoting effects of the environmental pollutant, trichloroethylene (TCE),
have focused on functional effects in effector/memory CD4+ T cells from lupus-prone mice. Our long-term goal
is to understand how TCE drives CD4 cell differentiation to promote autoimmunity and/or hypersensitivity
disorders. The objectives are (i) to determine how TCE through its primary metabolite, trichloroacetaldehyde
hydrate (TCAH), alters differentiation of naÃ¯ve CD4 cells to effector/memory subsets important in promoting
(e.g., Th1 and Th17) or suppressing autoimmunity (e.g., Th2 and TREG) in vitro and (ii) to determine
pathogenicity of these subsets in vivo. CD4s will be compared in both autoimmune-prone (MRL+/+) and
resistant (B6) strains of mice to understand the contribution of genetic susceptibility factors. Inclusion of both
sexes may reveal why being female elevates autoimmune disease risk. The central hypothesis is that TCAH
promotes the differentiation of pathogenic effector cells and/or decreases expansion of effector cells
associated with suppression of autoimmunity involving changes in gene expression and DNA methylation.
TCAH will generate unique genetic signatures although immune pathology will be observed in MRL+/+ mice
rather than in B6 mice, that will be more robust in females vs. males. The rationale is that it is now apparent
that key CD4 functional effects that may be regulated at the level of DNA methylation occur during
differentiation, and thus cannot be studied in already differentiated cells. The central hypothesis will be tested
in three specific aims: 1) Define effects of TCAH on CD4+ T cell differentiation by assessing gene expression
and 2) DNA methylation and 3) Determine pathogenicity of differentiating Th subsets in vivo. Under the first
Aim, RNA-Seq will determine whether TCAH directly alters the expression of genes that may confer a selective
advantage to pathogenic effector CD4+ T cells. In Aim 2, reduced representation bisulfite sequencing will be
used to determine TCAH-induced changes in DNA methylation in differentiating CD4+ T cells. Experiments will
test whether gene expression changes induced by TCAH are mediated at the level of DNA methylation using
either methyl donors or methylation inhibitors to reverse effects. The presence of important methyl variants will
be determined by flow cytometry. The third Aim will test Th subsets for their ability to generate immune
pathology in adoptive transfer experiments. Treatment of cells with methyl donors prior to transfer will connect
Aim 1 and 2 results to determine whether TCAH promotes T cell-mediated pathology in a DNA methylation-
dependent manner. The proposed research is innovative and significant because it focuses on how TCAH
alters the fluid DNA methylation pattern generated during differentiation that will lead to the discovery of novel
gene or methylation patterns that may be responsible for TCE-induced immune disorders in humans. Such
knowledge may identify immune-mediated pathways for targeted therapy by normalizing immune responses in
TCE-exposed individuals."
10607988,"Dr. Sox-Harris has three major health services research areas, all with high relevance to VA
healthcare. 1) Developing, validating, and implementing predictive models for surgical
treatments and their alternatives. Dr. Sox-Harris is leading a HSR&D-funded project (IIR 13-051-3)
to develop and validate predictive models of short-term complications and long-term outcomes of
patients receiving total hip or knee arthroplasty. This project has produced the most accurate
predictive models of surgical complications following total joint arthroplasty and the team is in the
process of producing models to predict which patients will experience the most and least
improvements from this common treatment for osteoarthritis. The next step in this program of
research is to test methods to integrate these predictions into informed consent, shared decision
making, and risk stratification, as well as the identification and management of modifiable risk factors
to improve the outcomes of patients. He is also submitting two new grants in the fall of 2018 to
develop and validate prediction models for (a) candidate treatments for non-specific low back pain
and (b) persistent postoperative pain. 2) Developing, validating, and evaluating the effects of
health care quality measures for diverse medical conditions. Dr. Sox-Harris has led several
projects (e.g., 07-092-1, IIR10-370-2) focused on the validity and effects of existing addiction
treatment quality measures. Results from this research has generated wide interest and debate in the
addiction field and contributed to the methodological literature by increasing awareness of the
ecological fallacy (i.e., misleading conclusions about individuals from analyses of aggregated data) as
it pertains to quality measure validation and interpretation. Overall, his work changed the landscape
of addiction treatment quality measurement within VA and beyond, and has been recognized with
several national awards. He has expanded the impact of this line of research in a mentoring role (e.g.,
IIR 15-436-2, IIR 16-239), and his program of quality measurement research continues with a shift in
clinical focus to conditions for which surgery is a major treatment option (e.g., carpal tunnel
syndrome, total joint arthroplasty); 3) Implementation and de-implementation research. Dr. Sox-
Harris has two VA-funded projects (SDP 11-411 recently completed, IIR 16-216) focused on
implementation of evidence-supported treatments (e.g., medication treatment of alcohol use disorder)
and de-implementation of unsafe, ineffective, or low value treatments and practices (e.g., low value
preoperative testing for low risk procedures). His current and planned work in this area is primarily
focused on targets relevant to surgical procedures (e.g., low value testing after surgery, routine use of
general anesthesia when less risky/costly options exist) and conditions for which surgery is a major
treatment option (e.g., chronic low back pain).
The unifying theme behind these research areas is that they represent significant unsolved problems
in the VA health care system and beyond. Dr. Sox-Harris' driving motivation is to identify high-impact
and persistent problems in the VA healthcare system for which health services research might
provide essential insights and innovations. He has a record of successful grant applications (15
grants as PI, 18 as co-investigator), publishing in scientific journals (185 manuscripts, H-Index of 40),
and mentoring early career and other researchers. In recognition of his commitment to conducting
research that directly informs healthcare delivery and outcomes, Dr. Sox-Harris received the
inaugural VA HSR&D System Impact Award in 2015, for a program of research that has had âa direct
and important impact on clinical practice or clinical policy in the VA Healthcare System.â"

The Stanford Diabetes Research Center (SDRC) embodies the culmination of a strategic plan by the Stanford
University School of Medicine to create a premier program founded on a base of superb, collaborative
investigators studying basic, clinical and translational problems in diabetes research. The SDRC mission is to
foster innovation, new knowledge, and training in diabetes-related research, leading to improved diagnosis,
treatment, and ultimately, prevention and cure of diabetes and its complications. Renewal of this P30
application will leverage diabetes research at Stanford University by providing crucial resources dedicated to
supporting investigations and enrichment activities focused on diabetes. Stanford has a strong tradition of
academic excellence, innovation, and clinical care, united in a true University on a single campus that fosters
interactions between scientists and clinicians from different disciplines. Stanford is in the heart of Silicon
Valley, an epicenter of innovation and calculated risk-taking, whose companies partner with SDRC faculty in
unique and growing collaborations to advance diabetes research and care. Stanford neighbors two Universities
of California (UC) at Berkeley, and at Davis, both elite research centers with a growing diabetes research base
unconnected to a NIDDK DRC. The SDRC is comprised of 124 members from 3 Schools at Stanford, and from
multiple Schools at UC Berkeley and UC Davis. SDRC members at Stanford currently have $65,044,250 in
annual direct costs for diabetes-related research. SDRC members are organized by affinity groups focused on
(i) Islet & Pancreas Biology, (ii) Metabolism & Signaling, (iii) Immunology, Transplantation & Stem Cell Biology,
and (iv) Bioengineering & Behavioral Sciences. The SDRC consists of: (1) Administrative Component that
coordinates scientific, organizational, enrichment, training and outreach activities, (2) Biomedical Research
Component that recruits and selects members, and supervises 4 Research Cores that facilitate and enhance
their research, and (3) a successful SDRC Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) Award Program that promotes the
diabetes research of early stage investigators, and established scientists new to diabetes research. We
propose to expand this Program to include a Regional P&F Program that supports research at UC Davis and
Berkeley. NIH support for the SDRC is amplified by (1) Stanfordâs sustained commitment to provide space and
significant financial resources, (2) a comprehensive array of institutional research cores, which allow NIDDK
funds to support specialized SDRC research cores devoted to diabetes research, (3) collaborative efforts with
other Stanford research centers, and (4) SDRC member leadership of high-profile national diabetes research

The Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Treatment (START) is an international randomized trial
designed to determine whether initiation of ART at CD4+ counts > 500 cells/mm3 (immediate
or early ART) is superior in terms of morbidity and mortality to deferral of ART until the CD4+
declines to 350 cells/mm3 (deferred ART). On May 15, 2015 after an average of 3 years of
follow-up, the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for START determined
that the study primary question had been answered. Over an average follow-up of 3 years,
immediate use of ART provided significant benefit over deferred ART for the primary endpoint
(a composite of AIDS and non-AIDS events) of START (rates were 0.60 and 1.38 per 100
person years for the immediate and deferred ART groups. The DSMB recommended that
results be immediately disseminated, that participants in the deferred ART group be offered
ART, and recognizing the relatively short follow-up, that follow-up continue. With this proposal,
investigators in the International Network for Strategic Initiatives in Global HIV Trials
(INSIGHT) will continue follow-up of the 4,684 HIV-positive participants enrolled in START
through December 2021, and carry out final data analyses aimed at determining whether the
risk of major morbidity and mortality associated with delayed initiation is eliminated once ART
is initiated and HIV RNA levels are suppressed or whether it persists. No prior randomized trial
has addressed this question. Multiple papers will summarize the long-term follow-up findings
and results will also be presented at scientific conferences."

min/day of inspiratory muscle strength training (IMST) for 6 weeks lowers casual (resting) SBP by ~12 mmHg.
 This simple approach to lowering BP could be applied to almost any population however we propose to
study IMST in older adults with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is an ideal population to target because
OSA prevalence is growing and because snoring and apneas result in chronic intermittent hypoxemia that
drives sympathetic nervous system (SNS) hyperactivity, endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. These
substantive risks for cardiovascular disease are compounded by poor adherence to the mainstay treatment
continuous positive airway pressure (<50%), obesity, fatigue and a robust intolerance for exercise.
 Our findings in healthy young adults (n=50) show IMST-related reductions in BP are mediated by
decreases in systemic vascular resistance, suggesting changes in vascular tone and function. Consistent with
this hypothesis, our results from a pilot clinical trial in adults with OSA (n=24) show IMST-related reductions in
plasma norepinephrine levels (PNE) and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), both markers of SNS
activity. Our preliminary mechanistic assessments indicate IMST may lower circulating concentrations of other
vasoconstrictor factors and increase nitric oxide (NO)-mediated endothelium-dependent dilation. And, findings
in a novel endothelial cell culture model, point to increases in NO and declines in reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and oxidative stress. However, it is unknown if: 1) IMST lowers casual and 24-h (ambulatory) SBP in
older adults with OSA; 2) the reductions in SBP are long-lasting; 3) arterial stiffness, NO-mediated endothelial
dilation and/or oxidative stress are improved; and 4) if adherence in this population is high long term.
 We propose a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial to establish the efficacy of IMST
(75% maximum inspiratory pressure, [PImax]) 5 days/week for 24 weeks vs. placebo (15%PImax) (n=61/group)
for lowering SBP in adults (>50 years) with above normal BP and OSA. We hypothesize that IMST will lower
SBP via reductions in SNS activity and circulating vasoconstrictor factors, improvements in vascular function,
and reductions in oxidative stress/inflammation and that reductions in SBP will be sustained after IMST.
Aim 1: To determine casual and 24-h ambulatory BP; before/after, and 4- and 12-weeks post-IMST/placebo
training. Safety, tolerability and adherence also will be assessed.
Aim 2: To measure arterial stiffness, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMDBA), plasma PNE, MSNA,
vasoconstrictor factors and inflammation; before/after, and 4- and 12-weeks post-IMST/placebo training.
Aim 3: To evaluate superoxide related suppression of FMDBA, and markers of oxidative stress and antioxidant
defense in endothelial cells from subjects before/after, and 4- and 12-weeks post-IMST/placebo training."
10625330,"ABSTRACT: As outlined in DAT18-08, NIDA has a strong interest in understanding treatment utilization among
persons with opioid use disorders (POUDs) as they transition from prison to the community, because treating
individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) simultaneously improves public health and public safety. Kentucky
is in the midst of an opioid crisis, with many POUDs cycling through the criminal justice system each year. While
evidenced-based medications for addiction treatment (MAT) exist for treating OUD, MAT is underutilized within
prisons, which elevates the risk of relapse and overdose when POUDs are released and re-enter their
communities. Research is scant regarding the multi-level factors associated with offendersâ willingness to initiate
MAT while in prison and their continued engagement in treatment after release. Furthermore, rural and urban
populations have not been compared. In response to NIDA DAT18-08, we propose to conduct the high-impact
Geographic variation in Addiction Treatment (GATE) study, which will address the knowledge gap on multi-level
factors influencing prison-based extended-release injectable naltrexone (XR-NTX) initiation as well as examine
predictors of post-release MAT use and adverse outcomes (i.e., relapse, overdose, recidivism) among both rural
and urban POUDs. This mixed methods study employs a social ecological framework to understand individual
characteristics that influence MAT initiation and adverse outcomes, as well as contexts more distal to the
individual, including social networks and structural factors. The specific aims of the GATE study are: 1) to
identify the individual, personal network, and structural factors associated with XR-NTX initiation in
prison among rural, as compared to urban, POUDs, and 2) to examine the individual, personal network,
and structural factors predicting MAT use, treatment use, and adverse outcomes in the community
among re-entering rural, as compared to urban, POUDs over time. A prospective observational longitudinal
cohort study will be conducted with 500 POUDs, using survey and social network data collected in prison and
at 6- and 12-months post-release to explore multi-level rural-urban variation in key outcomes. In-depth guided
qualitative interviews will be conducted with POUDs, prison-based treatment staff, and social service clinicians.
To maximize rigor and reproducibility, we will employ a concurrent triangulation strategy, whereby qualitative
and quantitative data contribute equally to the analysis and are used for cross-validation. This study is led by a
qualified interdisciplinary team and is the first mixed methods study examining the processes of social influences
that occur in rural and urban social networks as POUDs transition from prison back to geographically diverse
counties. The GATE study will enhance our ability to address the opioid epidemic within the correctional contexts
of prisons and community supervision by informing process improvement efforts for prison-based MAT initiation
and post-release retention in care, applying network science findings to improve the re-entry planning process,
and establishing the foundation for future R-level intervention applications."
11003903,"Abstract
Neuroinflammation is a driving force contributing to neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease
(PD). Microglia are the primary immune cell of the brain and are among the first responders to infection, toxic
insult and aggregated proteins and contribute significantly to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. The
microglial inflammatory response, including inflammasome activation, has been demonstrated to be significantly
associated with PD. Paraquat (PQ) is a commonly used herbicide that has been linked to increased risk for PD.
PQ-induced neurodegeneration is tightly coupled to the activation of microglia and appears to require priming of
the microglial response. Therefore, factors that modulate the microglial inflammatory response could lead to
neuroprotection and slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. However, to date, no anti-
inflammatory drugs have proven successful in human clinical trials necessitating research on new targets. Hv1
(HVCN1) is a voltage-gated proton channel highly expressed on microglia in the brain and in other immune cells
in the body. This proton channel regulates the activity of NADPH oxidase and production of reactive oxygen
species in immune cells and especially microglia. Our preliminary data demonstrate that PQ directly increases
Hv1 levels in microglia, possibly through an epigenetic mechanism involving histone acetylation. Further, our
data demonstrate effects of PQ on the NLRP3 inflammasome that appear to be regulated by Hv1, providing a
potential mechanism contributing to PQ-induced microglial priming. This proposal seeks to test the hypothesis
that Hv1 regulates priming of microglia following PQ exposure through the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to
neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. The Specific Aims of this project are to 1) Determine mechanisms
of Hv1 regulation following paraquat exposure 2) Define the role of Hv1 in regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome
following paraquat exposure and 3) Determine the contribution of microglial Hv1 and the NLRP3 inflammasome
in regulating neurodegeneration following paraquat exposure. Completion of these Aims will define regulatory
mechanisms for Hv1 and determine the role of Hv1 in regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation and
their role in PQ-induced neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity. Together, these Aims will provide crucial
information on the function of a novel regulator of neuroinflammation, Hv1, and determine whether targeting Hv1
may be a viable therapeutic strategy in toxicant-induced neurodegeneration."
10808907,"Prostate cancer (CaP) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer
death in men over the age of fifty. Bone is the primary site of metastasis in patients whose CaP progresses
beyond organ confinement. The absence of curative therapies for metastatic CaP emphasizes the imperative to
develop innovative technologies for target-specific delivery of therapeutic agents as well as novel treatment
strategies that are efficacious with minimal toxicity. Our investigative team seeks to address different aspects of
CaP bone metastasis through a highly integrated and focused research effort that will enhance our
comprehension of the mechanisms underlying CaP progression and improve therapeutic strategies to eradicate
bone metastases and prevent relapse. Our early work using a subtraction hybridization screen identified two
unique genes, i.e., melanoma differentiation associated gene-9 (mda-9) and mda-7/IL-24 from terminally
differentiating human melanoma cells. Subsequent research established MDA-9 as a key promoter of cancer
invasion and metastasis, whereas MDA-7/IL-24 was recognized as a broad-spectrum anti-cancer therapeutic.
Using a newly developed syngeneic pre-clinical model of CaP bone metastasis, we will investigate the interplay
between CaP bone metastases and the bone niche orchestrated by MDA-9 and evaluate therapeutic activity of
âfirst-in-classâ small molecule inhibitor of MDA-9 (i.e., PDZ1i) for targeting both metastatic CaP cells and the bone
niche. By exploiting the exquisite ability and high efficiency of T cells to locate and destroy disseminated cancer
cells, especially those in normally inaccessible sites, i.e., bone, we will engineer CaP-reactive T cells to produce
MDA-7/IL-24, a unique cancer-selective apoptosis-inducing cytokine, for improved capacity to attack potentially
antigenically heterogenous bone metastases. Last, based on the ability of PDZ1i to reprogram the immune niche
in the tumor microenvironment, we will combine engineered T cells producing next-generation MDA-7/IL-24
(âSuperkine MDA-7/IL-24â, âS7Mâ), having enhanced secretion and stability, with MDA-9-targeted therapy for
synergistic elimination of CaP bone lesions. We anticipate that the insights garnered from these studies will
enable a more precise molecular understanding of bone metastasis development for target discovery, rational
design of improved cellular immunotherapy, and combinatorial treatment modalities optimized to achieve a
maximum therapeutic potential. Successful completion of this multidisciplinary, synergistic research program will
provide a rapid path to translate these technologies and strategies into the clinic to safely and effectively manage
this most common skeletal complication of CaP."

10813858,"Project Summary
The long-term goals of our research program, which has been supported by NIGMS since 2007, has been to
understand how host-microbe interactions influence the physiology and behavior of Caenorhabditis elegans,
with the anticipation that studies of the simple animal host will provide insights into interactions between
microbes and more complex animal hosts. We have brought a broad interdisciplinary perspective, with an
experimental approach grounded in the molecular genetics of C. elegans, to studies that have spanned
evolutionarily conserved pathways of innate immunity, the integrative physiology that connects infection and
immunity with cellular and organismal responses to stress, and how interactions with microbes influence
neuronal signaling and behavior of C. elegans. Our most recent focus, and the principal goal of this project over
the next five years, is to understand how bacteria influence nervous system signaling and behavior of C.
elegans. We have described how specific virulence-associated secondary metabolites produced by the
pathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa can modulate expression of a TGF-beta ligand in a pair of
sensory neurons of C. elegans to promote avoidance behavior, defining a genetic, neuronal, and chemical basis
for the molecular mechanisms by which microbial metabolites can modulate host organism behavior. We have
further determined how environmental and endogenous cues converge on the regulation of neuroendocrine
gene expression, revealing insight into the hierarchical regulation of inputs that control decision-making
behavior of C. elegans. Having defined the molecular pathways involved the innate recognition of P.
aeruginosa by the sensory nervous system, we will continue to take a systematic genetic approach to turn our
attention to the question of how infection and changes in internal state can modify neuroendocrine gene
expression and behavior. We also plan to expand the scope of our studies in a more exploratory manner, to
identify additional genetic and neuronal pathways that are modulated by host interactions with not only
pathogenic bacteria such as P. aeruginosa, but also bacterial species that have been identified in close
association with C. elegans in its natural environment. We expect that the genetic and overall experimental
tractability of the simple C. elegans host will enable us to work towards a comprehensive analysis of how
microbial metabolites act on the nervous system to modulate neuroendocrine physiology and behavior. The
microbiota and its metabolites have been increasingly implicated in diverse aspects of homeostasis and the
pathogenesis of disease in host animals. We anticipate our studies of C. elegans will have implications for the
understanding of host-microbe interactions in other hosts organisms."
10806150,"PROJECT SUMMARY: 5-methylcytosine oxidation in development and disease
DNA methylation at gene promoters and enhancers is usually an indication that genes are silenced, whereas
loss of methylation through the TET-mediated 5-methylcytosine (5mC) oxidation pathway can lead to gene
activation. TET proteins and the 5mC oxidation pathway are known, pivotal actors in embryonic development
and disease, yet the mechanisms by which TET-mediated 5mC oxidation is regulated are completely unknown.
We recently discovered that the protein SMCHD1 is a potential negative regulator of TET activity. In
humans, SMCHD1 depletion activates the DUX4 gene(s) that cause(s) cell toxicity, muscle degeneration, and
facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). We hypothesize that one key function of SMCHD1 is to control
5mC oxidase activities and that lack of SMCHD1 leads to an over-activation of TET-mediated epigenetic function,
and the activation of DUX4. The objective of this project is to test this hypothesis and obtain a fundamental
understanding of how SMCHD1 interacts with and controls TET-mediated epigenetic function in normal
embryonic development and disease. In Aim 1, we will use mouse embryonic stem cells and human induced
pluripotent stem cells to determine the basic mechanisms of SMCHD1-regulated TET function in normal
development. We will employ SMCHD1-knockout cell and mouse lines and determine how TET protein
distribution in the genome is altered; which loci are affected; if the distribution of oxidized 5-methylcytosine bases
(5hmC) is specific to SMCHD1 binding sites; which regions of the (zygotic) genome are activated upon SMCHD1
loss; and if there are shared SMCHD1-mediated regulatory pathways between mouse and human pluripotent
cells. The results of these experiments will establish the negative regulatory function of SMCHD1 in normal
development and set the stage for disease-specific studies in Aim 2. In Aim 2, we will inactivate SMCHD1 in
human muscle cells and determine the epigenetic role of SMCHD1 in cell differentiation and disease by
determining gene expression changes, chromatin structure, and genome-wide DNA methylation status. We
expect that SMCHD1-mediated TET inhibition and regulation of gene expression will be similar in human and
mouse cells, and that depleting TET activity in SMCHD1 knockout cells will at least partially reverse the effects
of SMCHD1 loss-of-function phenotypes. In Aim 3, we will perform biochemical studies of SMCHD1-TET
protein-protein interactions to identify key binding domains, and determine if TET inhibitors can silence DUX4
expression in cell lines lacking functional SMCHD1, and in muscle cells derived from FSHD patients. If
successful, these data will provide proof of principle that TET inhibitors may have therapeutic benefit for FSHD
patients. Together, the results of this project will generate the first mechanistic, regulatory model of the TET-
mediated 5mC oxidation pathway in mouse and man, and the role of the novel TET-SMCHD1 axis in normal
development and disease."
10735793,"Background: This is the second submission of an HSR&D IIR proposal to transition Dr. Hillary Mull, Ph.D.
from her HSR&D Career Development Award (CDA) project toward an independent VA health services
research career. The proposed work seeks to build on Dr. Mull's successful CDA project by adapting her
approach to developing and validating a surveillance model for outpatient surgery to invasive procedures in
non-surgical clinical specialties: interventional cardiology, interventional radiology and gastrointestinal
endoscopy procedures. This informatics-based approach relies on combining text and structured data fields in
the VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW). Dr. Mull's CDA-funded surveillance research identified an adverse
event rate of 9% and had a positive predictive value of 85%, dramatically improving adverse event detection.
 Significance/Impact: Presently, there is no active surveillance of invasive procedures and preliminary
analyses and conversations with frontline staff suggest adverse events occur with some frequency and impose
significant patient harm. Prior work found invasive procedures in these three specialties result in post-
procedure emergency room visits or hospitalizations exceeding 50,000 cases annually. Non-VA literature
suggests half of this utilization may be preventable with improvements in clinical care (e.g., adherence to
antibiotic prescribing guidelines). This field of research will become even more important as care increasingly
transitions outside the operating room. Detecting and monitoring adverse events in understudied settings using
existing data in the VA CDW is consistent with HSR&D funding priority C-Healthcare Informatics.
 Innovation: Together with experts from COINs around the country and the support of operational partners
from each clinical specialty, Pharmacy Benefits Management and VA Informatics and Computing
Infrastructure, Dr. Mull proposes to apply her CDA expertise to build a surveillance system to identify invasive
non-surgical procedures with preventable adverse events; these procedures are not subject to any VA
surveillance activities. A second gap this work addresses is the lack of a nationally available dataset capturing
procedural anesthesia use. We will use chart review and text-query data mining methods to obtain this
information. The culmination of our IIR work will be a comprehensive database of adverse events and
potentially modifiable contributing factors, including procedural anesthesia data, available to VA researchers.
 Specific Aims: 1) develop and validate surveillance models using FY17-20 data; 2) test the surveillance
system (apply model coefficients, perform limited chart review on a monthly basis) from FY21-22, and refine
the system using additional CDW variables; 3) test hypotheses related to modifiable processes including
whether a trained anesthesia provider was involved or patients received inappropriate antibiotics.
 Methodology: Our sample includes non-surgical invasive procedures defined by expert clinician co-
investigators. We will follow the methods outlined in Dr. Mull's CDA work to aggregate patient, procedure,
provider and facility data from the CDW. Next, we will review cases to determine whether a preventable event
occurred and use chart review data to estimate logistic regression models predicting the likelihood of an
adverse event. Model coefficients will be applied on an ongoing fashion to identify cases likely to have an
adverse event to target chart review. Surveillance data will be used to test study hypotheses.
 Next Steps/Implementation: Through this IIR, and in a subsequent partner-funded QUERI proposal, Dr.
Mull and her team will establish an adverse event surveillance system designed for invasive non-surgical
procedures that can be used to assess modifiable processes of care to prevent patient harm. By identifying risk
factors for preventable adverse events, we can determine where we, with our operational partners, should
focus QUERI-funded QI work to improve patient safety. Study results will provide much needed information to
the research and clinical communities as they continue to measure and improve the quality of VA care."
10845456,"Alarming racial and ethnic disparities in maternal mortality persist in the US. Black women are three to four
times more likely to die a pregnancy-related death as compared with White women, and in some regions
Latinas are also at increased risk. This disparity is rooted in the fact that Black and Latina women experience
elevated maternal health risks throughout the pregnancy-postpartum continuum. Women of color are more
likely to begin pregnancy with a chronic health condition such as hypertension or diabetes, experience a
complication while pregnant, and to suffer a life-threatening morbidity during delivery. Less recognized is that
heightened maternal health risks extend into the postpartum period. Black and Latina women are more likely to
experience a postpartum complication, to seek care in the emergency department (ED) after delivery, and
have an increased risk of postpartum hospital readmission relative to White women. Growing attention has
focused on the postpartum period as an important window to address maternal mortality disparities as half of
pregnancy-related deaths occur within one day to one year after delivery and the majority of maternal deaths
and a sizable portion severe complications are preventable. We propose a mixed method study to better
identify Black and Latina women most at risk for poor outcomes following delivery, the problems they
experience, and to adapt an evidence-based intervention that aims to improve quality of postpartum care for
high risk women. The aims of our research study, âImproving Health Outcomes and Equity by Targeting
Postpartum Mothers at Highest Riskâ are to: 1) Develop a risk a prediction model using sociodemographic,
clinical, behavioral, and neighborhood factors to identify high-risk mothers using ED visits and postpartum
readmissions as a marker of severe maternal morbidity. 2) Use qualitative methods to adapt and intensify an
evidence-based behavioral educational intervention aimed at improving quality of care to reduce severe
maternal morbidity as measured by postpartum ED use and hospital readmission, 3) Conduct a pilot RCT
utilizing the cohort identified by the risk prediction model in Aim 1 to assess feasibility, acceptability, and target
effect size and potential efficacy of the refined intervention to reduce ED visits and postpartum readmissions,
and 4) Evaluate the pilot study results and procedures to inform the refinement of the intervention and to
prepare for a larger implementation trial of this intervention."
10838614,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The emergence of unprecedented high-resolution structures of biological building blocks is revolutionizing the
way we can rationalize the protein machinery, yet the structure only offers a necessary, but insufficient, starting
point to uncover protein property, activity and function. There is a fundamental knowledge gap in understanding
the translation of protein structure and surface chemistry into protein property and function. Even a property as
widely studied as protein solubility cannot be a priori predicted from a known protein structure with our current
tools and knowledge, as underscored by the observation that many single mutations invoke minimal structural
changes while dramatically changing the stability, property and aggregability. Our vision is to uncover the code
for translating protein surface structural properties into protein surface activity, interaction and function. The Han
lab is working on achieving such translation, among others, aided by advanced spectroscopy methods that probe
local protein dynamics, site-specific hydration properties and conformational ensembles. These measurements
are enabled by existing state-of-the-art tools, such as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) lineshape
analysis, pulsed dipolar EPR and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), as well as novel approaches
developed by the Han lab, such as Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization (ODNP) and other DNP-amplified
NMR methods. The combination of these methods will enable the detection of protein surface hydration, topology
and interaction, in dilute solution state under physiological conditions and with enhanced sensitivity. The Han lab
will systematically apply and refine the tools and methods to study protein stability, interaction, phase separation,
oligomerization to aggregation. The five-year goals focus on the following select classes of proteins. We choose
the globular protein LOV as a model to uncover the structure-function relationship to aid in rational protein
engineering leading to properties such as enhanced binding affinity, allostery, fluorescent property and controlled
conformational plasticity. We choose the protein tau to study an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) for which
single-point mutations and subtle partner interactions significantly tune its stability and aggregation propensity
in disease contexts. Our goal will be to reveal the mechanisms, e.g. by hydration perturbation or conformational
ensemble shifts, through which mutations and other modifications modulate aggregation propensity. Finally, we
aim to uncover the structural and mechanistic basis, as well as functional consequences, of oligomerization of
two trans-membrane proteins, PR and A2A. The long-term goal of this proposal is to decipher the design rules
for interactions and active surfaces of proteins, so that from the protein surface structure and topology one can
predict where the binding site is, or learn how to design one that rationally modulates protein-protein assembly,
and select or design specific aggregation pathways."
10399405,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a safe, non-ionizing diagnostic tool. The overall goal of this
project is to arrive very close to the ultimate intrinsic signal to noise ratio (UISNR) for a given MRI
magnet field strength by combining innovations in very advanced transceiver technology. In Phase I, a
high performance head RF coil receiver array will be prototyped and SNR performance compared to an
existing commercial product. Emphasis in Phase II will be towards Phase I coil optimization, mechanical
housing design followed by systematic phantom validation.
 MRI is the preferred method for examining soft tissue structures. However MRI signals are weak due
to the small difference in energy levels population of parallel and anti-parallel spins (~6ppm at 1.5T) that
contribute to the signal. Clinical MRI exams demand high resolution and/or fast scanning. Since SNR is
the main limitation on fulfilling these requirements, it is the most important parameter of MRI systems.
 MRI SNR can be increased by signal averaging at the expense of lengthy scan times. Pursuit of
higher SNR on one hand has resulted in a shift toward the use of higher static magnetic fields which is
expensive and has siting and safety issues. On the other hand, we are rapidly approaching limitations in
MRI systems with greater number of receiver channels.
 We propose novel innovations to optimize MRI SNR for a given magnet field strength. Generally SNR
can be increased by increasing the signal strength or by reducing noise. We propose novel combinations
to achieve maximum, near ultimate intrinsic MRI SNR by efficiently accomplishing both. The technology
proposed has broad applications within and outside of MRI. A successful project will improve the MR
image quality in shorter scan times thereby alleviating burden on high cost, high magnet field based MRI
systems. The work proposed is original."
10671453,"A core goal of the BRAIN Initiative is to link neural activity to behavior which requires technology to acquire high-quality recordings of dynamic neural activity from different brain regions over time. To achieve this core goal, this optimization proposal will address the most pressing areas of technology development to enable the dissemination of polymer microelectrode arrays with such capability and promote their integration into neuroscience research practice. Polymer-based neural interfaces can achieve high-quality recordings over a year or more which is attributed to the greater stability of the device-tissue interface compared to more rigid metallic wire and silicon-based neural interfaces. Another distinct advantage is that the same microfabrication technology can be used to produce batches of surface and penetrating electrode arrays with carefully controlled features with micron and submicron dimensional precision.  Microfabricated polymer probes are already available in limited designs having shank lengths of 10 mm or less and therefore predominantly used in rats. This technology needs to be extended for access to deeper brain regions in rodents and a wide range of brain targets in larger animals, including nonhuman primates, an important model in neuroscience and preclinical research. Existing device designs such as the prototype arrays previously developed for the rat hippocampus cannot simply be scale up or down to expand access to brain regions across different species. Instead, careful design is required in collaboration with users to meet space and weight requirements as well as workflow requirements to achieve precise placement at the desired depth.  Therefore, this proposal tackles the necessary optimization of the previously developed technology to enable a library of designs that will enable their use in different animal models and to target different brain regions. Another goal is to develop the appropriate insertion methods for reliably placing electrodes at the desired depth and targeted region. Once the passive recording arrays and the matching surgical insertion methods are developed and optimized at the benchtop, these will be evaluated in mice, rats, and NHPs.  Overall, this proposal not only addresses optimization but further advances in polymer microelectrode array technology for neural interfaces. This will enable early dissemination of polymer array systems for large-scale monitoring and manipulation of neural activity in collaboration with early adopters and demonstration of high-quality recordings obtained in multiple species over long periods that will attract additional users. Successful demonstration will facilitate our long-term goal of realizing the wide dissemination of reliable chronic neural interfaces across different neural tissues and species."
10618910,"Project Summary
Mosquitoes are well recognized as the most important arthropod vectors of disease-causing
pathogens. This is because most species are anautogenous and must feed on the blood of a
human or other vertebrate to produce eggs. Multiple cycles of blood feeding and egg
development in turn favors frequent contacts with hosts, which makes mosquitoes ideal
vectors for pathogen transmission. Since disruption of egg production also disables pathogen
transmission, understanding the reproduction of anautogenous mosquitoes is an important
area of study. This application is a renewal request to continue our work on how egg
development is regulated. Our current award focuses on Aedes aegypti, which is the primary
vector of the pathogens that cause Dengue Fever, Zika Virus syndrome and several other
human diseases. Our studies indicate that two neurohormones, ovary ecdysteroidogenic
hormone (OEH) and insulin-like peptides (ILPs) function as key regulators of the egg
development process. The overall goal of this application is to understand how ILP and OEH
signaling are tuned to regulate the different processes required for egg production. The
studies we propose are innovative because they will be the first to link receptor binding
preferences to the function of different ILP family members and OEH. Proposed Specific
Aims are to:
 1. Characterize the expression and receptor binding properties of different ILP family
 members and OEH.
 2. Characterize the pre- and post-vitellogenic functions of ILPs and OEH.
 3. Identify the factors that link nutrient acquisition after blood feeding to ILP and OEH
release.
Expected outcomes will enhance understanding of how egg formation is regulated in
mosquitoes. Our study will significantly impact the field of vector biology by identifying new
potential targets for disrupting female reproduction."
10850708,"Abstract
High-throughput analysis of a large number of samples can greatly benefit from sampling
barcoding as it can significantly reduce reagent costs and batch error as well as increasing the
acquisition speed. Optical barcoding with its readout compatible with fluorescence analysis offers
compelling advantages over DNA barcoding because it allows rapid multiparameter analysis of
each sample and does not rely on a binary âhitâ or âmissâ criterion. However, current fluorescence-
based barcoding does not meet the current and future needs of massive-scale multiplexing. The
goal of this project is to develop novel, highly scalable, optical multiplexing technology based on
multi-color laser particles. A combination of several discoidal microparticles, each emitting a
narrowband laser spectrum, can be tagged on the surface of cells or microbeads and serve as
the unique identifiers of the objects. The first specific aim is to develop 50 color sets of
semiconductor laser particles across a spectral range of 1150 to 1600 nm via microfluidic particle
sorting. The second specific aim develops applications of this new tool in three major high-
throughput analysis platforms: first, multiparameter flow cytometry of 384-pooled cell samples;
second, 3840-plex bead immunoassays; and third, all-optical multiparameter screening of
combinatorial one-bead-one-compound libraries. The breakthroughs in these high-throughput
technologies are expected to facilitate numerous biological discovery applications including drug
development."
10849612,"The acid sensing ion channel1a (ASIC1a) is essential for normal brain function, but initiates neuronal death
and contributes to ischemic brain injury. Prolonged reductions in extracellular pH accompany ischemia and
ASIC1a inhibition limits neurological damage. Yet, ASICs also play an important role in normal physiology and
established models of ASIC-induced cell death make it difficult to develop strategies that specifically inhibit
ASIC1a toxicity. Our preliminary data support a newer model of ASIC1a-induced cell death. Specifically, we
have discovered that the toxic effect of ASIC1a can be eliminated by modification of the intracellular region of
the channel or activation of the delta opioid receptor (DOR). An especially provocative aspect of these
findings is that acidotoxicity is inhibited without a reduction in ASIC1a current, thereby suggesting that the
toxic and physiological actions of the channel can be separated. Our central hypothesis is that DOR prevents
acidotoxicity through signaling cascades, which act on the intracellular domain of ASIC1a to limit protein
interactions required for toxicity. To test this hypothesis, we will define the mechanisms governing DOR action
on ASIC1a and elucidate their role in ischemic injury in vivo. The outcomes of the proposed work will reveal
novel regulatory mechanisms controlling ASIC1a-induced toxicity, suggest new interventions to mitigate
ASIC-induced death using existing DOR agonists, and reveal strategies to separate the physiological and
pathological actions of ASIC1a. These results will be significant as they are expected to have broad
implications for the prevention of brain injury following ischemic stroke as well as other disorders where
neuronal acidotoxicity plays a role."
10903718,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
This application is to evaluate the potential of a super-resolution microscopy system to image disrupted
nanoscale chromatin folding as an early event in carcinogenesis and explore its potential to improve cancer
risk stratification. Abnormal chromatin structure is among the most universal characteristics of tumor cells and
has been used for clinical cancer diagnosis for two centuries. However, due to the diffraction-limited resolution
of conventional light microscopy, only microscale structural abnormalities can be observed. As a result, cells
undergoing early stages of malignant transformation often appear normal. Such limitation in image resolution
has compromised our ability to accurately risk-stratify precursor lesions or distinguish aggressive from indolent
forms. Recent advances in super-resolution fluorescence nanoscopy now enable us to image molecular-level
chromatin structure down to a resolution of ~20-30 nm. Our group recently improved the throughput and
robustness in stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM)-based super-resolution microscopy and
enabled robust imaging of chromatin folding on the most widely used clinical samples. Built upon our
preliminary studies that revealed a significant and gradual disruption of nanoscale chromatin folding in early
carcinogenesis, this project will first further confirm the disrupted chromatin folding that accompanies
carcinogenesis and identify their molecular characteristics and functional consequences. Second, we will
optimize the workflow of super-resolution imaging system, sample preparation and image analysis to enable
efficient and reproducible analysis of nanoscale chromatin folding in clinical tissue samples. We will also
validate our finding of disrupted chromatin folding in patients with various colorectal precursor lesions and
cancer. Third, we will evaluate the potential of imaging nanoscale chromatin folding to in patients with
colorectal adenomatous polyps. This study will establish the scientific basis and underlying molecular profile of
disrupted nanoscale chromatin folding in early carcinogenesis, opening a new avenue for risk stratification,
facilitating the development and evaluation of new preventive strategies."

Latent toxoplasmosis continues to be a problem for immunocompromised infected
individuals and toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE) is one of the most common life threatening
central nervous system infections in these patients. The reactivation of latent
toxoplasmosis is attributed to lack of adequate CD4 T cell help that compromises the CD8
T cell immunity against the parasite. Similar to humans, mouse models of toxoplasmosis
have demonstrated the critical role of CD4 T cells for the maintenance of robust CD8 T
cell immunity. In a recent study we demonstrated that CD8 T dysfunction leading to
reactivation in chronically infected host is a consequence of CD4 T cell exhaustion.
Treatment of chronic host with antigen-specific non-exhausted CD4 T cells can restore
CD8 T cell functionality and prevent reactivation. Interestingly, CD4 exhaustion is linked
to up-regulation of transcription factor BLIMP-1, which causes an increase in the
expression of inhibitory receptors on these cells. Preliminary data for the proposal
suggests that during latent toxoplasmosis increased BLIMP-1 expression leads to
epigenetic changes in antigen-specific, CD4 TCM (central memory) subset. The
transcription factor gains accessibility to chromatin sites on this population and changes
their epigenetic landscape. BLIMP-1 ablation re-invigorates CD4 T cells due to
downregulation of inhibitory receptors and increased expression of positive co-stimulatory
molecules. The proposal has two specific aims. In aim 1 we will determine the chromatin
accessible sites on CD4 TCM that BLIMP-1 binds to. We plan to define the epigenetic
changes in CD4 TCM during latent toxoplasmosis that leads to their exhaustion. In aim 2
studies will be performed to evaluate if restoration of CD4 T cell function due to BLIMP-1
ablation is dependent on the up-regulation of 4-1BB and OX40 or other costimulatory
molecules identified in aim 1. We will determine if cell intrinsic signaling by these co-
stimulatory molecules is required for optimal recovery of CD4 T cell function in BLIMP-1
ablated cells. Finally, studies will be performed to determine if CD4 T cells treated with
agonist for co-stimulatory molecules downregulate inhibitory receptors on CD8 population
and confer strong effector cytotoxic program on these cells that is critical for containing
chronic toxoplasma infection."

 We seek to continue our population-based study of stroke incidence and case fatality, prevalence of risk
factors, stroke treatment, and post-stroke outcomes within a biracial metropolitan population of 1,368,604 of
whom 223,417 (16.3%) are of black race (US Census 2010). We expect to identify ~4500 physician confirmed
and well characterized stroke events (projected 2900 ischemic strokes, 525 hemorrhagic strokes, and 1075
transient ischemic attack [TIA]) among residents of the five-county Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky
(GCNK) region at all 20 regional hospitals/EDs for the period 7/1/2019 to 12/31/2020, as well as 2,000 survey
participants.
 For almost 25 years, we have studied trends in stroke incidence and case fatality and have demonstrated a
racial disparity where stroke incidence in African-Americans is more than double that of whites. In each prior
study period, we have also examined the prevalence of risk factors (and knowledge of stroke) via a population
survey in order to put our temporal trend findings into context.
 In addition to continuing these important activities, we also examined stroke recurrence in a population-
based fashion in our prior study period, finding that blacks were more likely to have recurrent events than
whites. We now seek to evaluate temporal trends in recurrence rates, and specifically racial disparities in
those temporal trends. Previously we had piloted methods of obtaining a population-based outcome among
stroke patients, and we are now ready to obtain outcomes after ischemic stroke across our entire population,
data that are desperately needed in the field. Finally, we have used our data to inform eligibility for stroke
clinical trials via a close collaboration with NIH StrokeNet and have shared our data with the scientific
community for this purpose. By obtaining more detailed outcomes data, we will now be able to better inform
proposed recovery and prevention trials as well."
10831907,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Human inferior colliculus (IC) plays a critical role in auditory processing. However, the anatomy and
function of the lemniscal (primary) and non-lemniscal subdivisions of IC in living humans are poorly understood
due to the technical challenges of in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the small midbrain structures
deep within the brain. In particular, despite predominant top-down and bottom-up theories of auditory learning,
the neural systems underlying human speech category learning is unknown. Recent advances in MRI acquisition
open the door for focused investigations into the anatomy and functional processing of human auditory midbrain.
My research environment and mentor team will allow me to gain the expertise necessary to independently
investigate the subcortical auditory system in living humans using MRI.
 In this project, we will use ultra-high field 7T MRI to quantify anatomical midbrain tissue contrast in a sub-
structure dependent manner. We will also map the structural connections from each IC subdivision throughout
the auditory system. Quantifying the specific anatomical MRI contrasts and connectivity patterns in living human
midbrain will enable future clinical applications for investigating hearing disorders such as sensorineural hearing
loss and tinnitus.
 A possible functional role for non-lemniscal IC is in learning novel speech sound categories. We will
collect 7T functional MRI at multiple timepoints during a sound-to-category learning program to assess the
contribution of IC and auditory cortex to sound category learning. Our results will elucidate whether novel
categories are learned via cortically driven plasticity (cortex represents categorical features at an earlier stage
than ICâs relevant acoustic enhancement) or stimulus feature enhancement (IC and cortex have similar time
courses of plasticity).
 Existing methods for probing auditory processing, such as the scalp-recorded frequency following
response (FFR), have both subcortical and cortical generators, but their relative contributions throughout the
auditory learning process have not been investigated in humans. Participants in our sound-to-category learning
paradigm will also undergo FFR recordings. Using representational similarity analysis, we will assess whether
sound category feature representation in FFRs primarily follows that of auditory cortex or that of IC, suggesting
the relative contribution of each generator at each phase of sound-to-category learning.
 This project implements state-of-the-art anatomical and functional 7T MRI techniques to quantify
foundational characteristics of the human inferior colliculus, a key but poorly investigated subcortical auditory
structure. The methods we utilized can be adapted to investigate other small, deep structures throughout the
human auditory system and will enhance our understanding of IC contributions to tinnitus and optimal placement
of auditory brain implants for individuals with sensorineural hearing loss."
10832006,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive neuromodulation method in which direct
current is passed through scalp electrodes. The current flows through the scalp, skull and CSF before
creating a weak electric field in the brain and causing membrane polarization in cortical neurons. Over the
last 20 years, thousands of studies have highlighted many wide ranging tDCS effects on perceptual, cognitive
and motor function. More recently, clinical trials have begun to assess the effectiveness of tDCS in treating
mental illnesses such as addiction, depression and schizophrenia. However, in spite of the massive amount
of financial and scientific resources directed towards tDCS, there is considerable debate about its
effectiveness and reproducibility. Perhaps even more surprisingly, the basic mechanism though which tDCS
exerts these effects remains unknown. The aim of this project is to answer this fundamental question by
elucidating and understanding the mechanisms driving the reported tDCS effects. In addition to the
neuromodulatory effects caused by direct polarization of cortical neurons, tDCS also stimulates cranial and
cervical nerves in the scalp that give indirect input to the brain. Potential effects from this indirect tDCS
neuromodulatory route have been largely overlooked by the field. This project will combine healthy volunteer
and animal experiments to investigate a range of potential tDCS mechanisms. Healthy volunteerâs
experiments will use careful controls and pharmacological blockers to probe the potential mechanisms that
are driving tDCS effects. Animal electrophysiology experiments will be used to test the validity of and to
provide insight into these mechanisms. Given the current issues in the tDCS field, the deeper mechanistic
insight provided by this project will be vital in advancing the tDCS field at this critical juncture. The new insight
provided by this project will help direct financial and scientific resources towards the development of improved
noninvasive neuromodulation therapies, which can then more effectively treat a wide range of neurological
and psychiatric disorders."
10612001,"Opioid use disorder is on the rise and the economic and human cost is staggering. It remains unclear why only
a subset of people who take opioids develop dependence, prompting efforts to understand factors that promote
vulnerability to opioid misuse. However, it is also critical to identify factors that promote resilience to substance
use disorder (SUD). Experiences early in life can alter risk/resilience for the later development of disorders. For
example, early life stress that is not overwhelming can have an âinoculatingâ effect that promotes the
development of resilience in adulthood. Here we use a rat model of early life adversity, the limited bedding and
nesting (LBN) model, to assess how this manipulation affects addiction-like phenotypes in adulthood. In LBN,
dams and their pups are exposed to a low resource environment during the pups first week of life, which induces
stress in the pups. We found that LBN inoculates males against addiction-like behaviors, such that adult male
rats exposed to LBN self-administer less morphine and are less motivated to take morphine than adult males
raised in a normal, adequately resourced, nesting environment. Impulsive choice, a risk factor for SUD, was also
assessed, and LBN reduced impulsive choice in males. LBN had no effect on these behaviors in female rats.
This proposal will determine how LBN further alters addition-like behaviors, as well as changes the physiology
and the transcriptome of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a region that critically mediates drug intake and
impulsivity. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that LBN shifts the dose-response curve for morphine self-
administration to the right in males. This aim will also determine if LBN reduces both impulsive choice and
impulsive action in males. Consistent with our preliminary data, behavioral changes following LBN in females
are not expected. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that LBN reduces glutamatergic transmission in the NAc of
males, but not females, an effect that would promote resilience to the reinforcing efficacy of morphine. Prior work
has demonstrated that early life experience can reprogram the brain through epigenetic modifications that lead
to persistent changes in gene expression and neuronal signaling. Thus, Aim 3 will identify sex-specific changes
in gene expression and accompanying chromatin remodeling events in the NAc elicited by LBN. Our preliminary
data reveal that LBN reduces the expression of several glutamate signaling genes in males. Certain histone
deacetylases (HDACs), enzymes that remove acetyl groups from histone tails, are implicated in these gene
changes. We will test the behavioral relevance of these HDACs by manipulating their function within the NAc
and determining whether they mediate resilience to addiction-related behavior. Collectively, this proposal will
reveal mechanisms by which LBN can inoculate males against addiction-like phenotypes. Notably, our team of
investigators is uniquely positioned to assess LBN-induced changes from the behavioral to the molecular level.
Moreover, the sex-specificity of the LBN effects will allow us to, by comparing the sexes, identify novel targets
that promote resilience to SUD, which may lead to the development of better therapies to reduce opioid misuse."

Alzheimerâs disease (AD) is heritable with a large proportion of phenotypic variability explained by genetic
components. Identifying these factors, particularly those that are modifiable in plasma biomarkers, could lead
to effective AD treatments and risk reduction strategies. Multi-ethnic studies showed that population differences
in genetic background can be leveraged to make novel discoveries that might require a sample sizes several
orders of magnitude larger than existing subject collections to achieve similar success within a single sub-
population. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) for AD has been focused on mostly Europeans ancestry,
especially lacking a large-scale GWAS in Asian Americans and Canadians. Heritability of AD is currently
unknown in Asians, and AD polygenic risk score applicable to Asians has not been established. The
overarching goal of the Project 1 is to uncover risk and protective variants for AD and plasma
biomarkers in the Asian Cohort for AD (ACAD). We propose a comprehensive approach in three specific
aims. For Aim 1, we will identify risk and protective variants for AD in ACAD participants and compare the
results to Asian and non-Asian populations. In collaboration with Data Management and Analysis Core (Core
D), this is the first major AD genetics study of Asians in the US and Canada and will compare results with
existing East Asians and multi-ethnic datasets obtained from the Alzheimer Disease Genetic Consortium
(ADGC). For Aim 2, we will understand genetic architecture for plasma AD biomarkers in ACAD participants.
We will identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for plasma AD related biomarkers including AÎ² peptides, total tau
(t-tau), phosphorylated-tau (p-tau 181), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) in collaboration with Core D,
Biosampe Core, and Project 2. For Aim 3, we will determine heritability of AD and establish AD polygenic risk
score (ADPRS) in ACAD participants. Our study will provide insights on Asian ancestry specific (ASAC and/or
Asians) and multi-ethnic targets in AD therapeutics. We anticipate that results from this study will facilitate
potential novel, population-specific therapeutic targets for AD for treating and preventing AD. The results from
this proposal will provide the important synergy to further investigate gene-environment interactions in Project
2."
10612012,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) plays a vital role in treating high-risk hematologic
malignancies and some non-malignant conditions. However, many patients undergoing HSCT develop acute
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and current prevention strategies that globally immunosuppress or
selectively deplete T cells are associated with higher risks of cancer relapse, delayed immune reconstitution,
increased infections, and other toxicities. Identifying the best way to suppress donor T cells to prevent GVHD
while not losing their beneficial functions remains a critically unmet need. The adoptive transfer of murine
invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells significantly reduces GVHD, and a number of human studies support a role
for iNKT cells in GVHD suppression. Several immunophenotypically and functionally distinct iNKT subsets have
been defined in mice, and only certain subsets have the capacity to suppress GVHD. Despite these advances
in understanding murine iNKT cells, the heterogeneity of human iNKT cells remains largely unexplored, and the
subset best suited to prevent GVHD is unknown. The overall goal of this proposal is to define human iNKT cell
heterogeneity and to develop strategies for the targeted selection and generation of immunosuppressive iNKT
cells. To achieve this goal, similar approaches to those used in mice, as well as novel techniques, will be used
to define the phenotypic, molecular, and functional characteristics of human iNKT subsets to delineate an
immunosuppressive population with the potential to prevent GVHD. In addition, a gene-engineering strategy will
be employed to enhance immunosuppressive function. These experiments will contribute substantially by
providing the scientific basis for the isolation of immunoregulatory iNKT cells which will enable the design of a
future clinical trial of iNKT cell adoptive transfer for GVHD prevention. Importantly, this work is broadly applicable
beyond control of GVHD, as understanding human iNKT heterogeneity will provide a framework for future studies
of iNKT cells and iNKT-based therapies in other disease states, including autoimmunity, cancer, and infection.
The proposed project is part of a comprehensive career development plan for the applicant to build upon her
substantial prior research experience in cellular immunology and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In
particular, she plans to acquire new skillsets including high throughput proteomic and transcriptomic analyses
and genetic engineering of cells. This training will occur under the guidance of her primary mentor, Dr. Robert

Strober, and Holden Maecker. Their guidance and expertise, combined with that of her collaborators Drs. Ken
Weinberg, Kara Davis, Nima Aghaeepour, and Everett Meyer, will ensure that the applicant completes the
proposed studies and acquires the expertise necessary to fulfill her career goal of becoming an independent
physician scientist with a research program focusing on immune regulation of GVHD in HSCT."

People who inject drugs (PWID) often do not receive evidence-based HIV prevention interventions, including
syringe service programs (SSP), medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and pre-exposure prophylaxis
(PrEP). This is an urgent problem in Connecticut and Massachusetts. Interventions that address individual and
structural barriers are needed. Furthermore, since PWID often do not receive routine medical care, it is
important to engage them in care in community-based settings. Although contingency management (CM) (i.e.,
use of tangible rewards to incentivize verifiable behavior change) can be effective to address substance use
and infectious disease prevention and treatment, it has not been studied for PrEP among PWID. CM may not
be uniformly effective as some individuals may need additional intervention, such as PrEP navigation, to
overcome individual or structural barriers to receiving HIV prevention interventions. Stepped care strategies
offer a solution as they are adaptive to individualsâ response (e.g. stepped care) to meet individual needs while
optimizing resources. We, therefore, propose a randomized controlled trial of 526 PrEP-eligible PWID in
partnership with opioid treatment programs, a harm reduction agency and AIDS service organization to
evaluate the impact of CM with stepped care as needed to include PrEP navigation (âCM2PNâ) vs. treatment
as usual (âTAUâ). Participants randomized to CM2PN will receive prize-based CM sessions over 9 sessions to
reward progress towards PrEP initiation adherence, engagement in MOUD and engagement in SSP and other
risk reduction activities. Individuals who do not have high levels of PrEP adherence by week 12 based on self-
report and confirmed by point-of-care urine testing, will be âstepped upâ to receive PrEP navigation over 5
sessions. PrEP navigation will be informed by Project INFORM and ARTAS, tailored specifically for PWID and
grounded in motivation interviewing principles. The intervention, CM2PN, will be delivered by trained PrEP
navigators. TAU includes a pamphlet on PrEP and information on ways to access other relevant care (e.g.,
MOUD). The primary outcome will be sustained PrEP adherence assessed by dried blood spot testing to
evaluate cumulative dosing over 6-8 weeks. Our specific aims are to compare the effectiveness of CM2PN
vs. TAU on: 1) on sustained PrEP adherence at 24 weeks; 2) HIV risk behaviors; engagement in opioid use
disorder-related care (SSP, MOUD) and extra-medical opioid use; and (exploratory) STI and HIV acquisition;
and 3) among PrEP navigators, front-line providers and staff, and leadership at each site, conduct an
implementation focused-process evaluation of CM2PN. Our team has expertise in integrating HIV and opioid
use disorder-related care, CM, clinicals trials with adaptive designs, community-engaged research and
implementation science. Innovative aspects include multi-target CM for PWID for PrEP; stepped care design;
academic-community-public health partnership to expand reach, impact and data capture. Study is of high
impact as CM2PN holds exceptional promise for promoting HIV prevention among PWID globally."
10845591,"A rapidly growing body of research shows that exposure to common environmental chemicals can disrupt
endocrine and metabolic function, and negatively impact pregnancy outcomes and child development. Studies
also demonstrate that certain pregnancy conditions (e.g., preeclampsia) and outcomes (e.g., preterm birth) are
associated with adverse health later in the life of the mother. However, research is lacking on the relationships
between exposures in pregnancy and later health of the mother, and how pregnancy outcomes impact those
associations. Puerto Rico suffers from elevated rates of numerous morbidities compared to the mainland U.S.,
including preterm birth and Type II diabetes. Puerto Rico also has a history of extensive contamination with
increased human exposure to a range of pollutants. We established the PROTECT cohort in the northern coast
of Puerto Rico to study the impacts of exposure to an array of environmental chemicals during gestation and
adverse pregnancy outcomes. We have developed an incredibly rich dataset on exposures, biomarkers of
intermediate effects, questionnaires, and health record information. PROTECT is also a participating cohort
within the newly established US-wide ECHO study, following the development of children born into PROTECT.
We propose building upon this vast dataset and continued recruitment in PROTECT, along with the repeated
participant contact during the ECHO follow-up visits, to investigate status and longitudinal trajectories of
maternal metabolic health and endocrine function for up to five years following pregnancy among 1000 women
in Puerto Rico. We have exposure biomarker data from repeated samples collected in pregnancy on urinary
phthalate metabolites, phenols/parabens, and PAH metabolites, as well as 17 metals measured in both urine
and blood. In this study, with new data and sample collection on PROTECT mothers at 6 months, 1 year, 2
years, and 5 years following delivery, we aim to: 1) Determine whether maternal exposures during pregnancy
are associated with measures and trajectories of metabolic health (i.e., body size, body composition, physical
strength, clinical diagnoses, blood pressure, and blood glucose, insulin, lipids, HbA1c) in short- and long-term
follow-up assessments after delivery; 2) Investigate the relationships between maternal exposures during
pregnancy and longitudinal measures of endocrine function (e.g., estradiol, testosterone, SHBG, FSH and
AMH) in the follow-up assessments after delivery; and 3) Explore effect modification of the associations
between pregnancy exposures and later womenâs health from the first two aims by pregnancy complications
(gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, preterm birth), and/or by social determinants (socioeconomic status,
social support, depression, stress, life experiences, and others) and other physical determinants of health
(body size, physical activity, breast feeding, polycystic ovarian syndrome, menstrual patterns, and others). The
expected outcomes of this study are to provide new and much needed information on the impacts of
pregnancy exposures, pregnancy outcomes, and social factors on womenâs health."
10624277,"Project Summary/Abstract
Sedentariness can lead to excess risk for maternal and child mortality and morbidity. Most pregnant women,
however, become sedentary in the 3rd trimester. In our randomized controlled trial with a high-risk group of
sedentary overweight/obese pregnant women with a history of preeclampsia, we found that 10 or more weeks
of stretching exercise (SE) reduced the incidence of preeclampsia - a significant risk factor for cardiovascular
disease - by lowering blood pressure (BP) and enhancing antioxidant up-regulation and production, compared
to walking, to which pregnant women adhered poorly. We plan to test if this effect can be extended to broader
populations of pregnant women. From our pilot study of healthy pregnant women, of which 84% were
overweight/obese, we reported promising results of the short-term effects of SEs on BP and sympatho-vagal
balance. Thus, we propose to test the effects of a novel SE intervention on cardiovascular health in obese
pregnant women in the 3rd trimester. We include evidence-based behavioral strategies to enhance adherence.
A session of SE includes 30 minutes of sequential static stretching of large skeletal muscle groups for 20 seconds,
3 times per muscle group. Although little is known about cardiovascular effects of SE, our preliminary findings
were unexpected yet consistent across our studies. If the findings persist, SE would be an effective, accessible,
cost-efficient way for obese pregnant women to promote their health and reduce risk of cardiovascular
complications of pregnancy. The study of SE interventions is therefore justified. In this 2-arm RCT we will
determine if a SE is superior to a control condition of enhanced usual care (eUC) which includes
moderate/vigorous activity, specifically walking, for 30 minutes 5 days/week as recommended by the American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Both the treatment and control arms will receive a supportive
behavioral intervention to facilitate adherence. Primary outcomes are BP, sympatho-vagal balance, and arterial
stiffness assessed at baseline (27 weeksâ gestation), then at 5 and 10 weeks later, and at 32 and 37 weeksâ
gestation. We will compare SE to eUC (n = 306; 153 per arm) and examine selected cardiovascular functions
by which SE may be effective. The Aims are: Aim 1: To test the efficacy of SE intervention on improving
cardiovascular health compared to eUC with respect to selected indicators of cardiovascular function (BP,
sympatho-vagal balance and arterial stiffness), controlling for anxiety, age, race/ethnicity, BMI, and smoking;
Aim 2: To test the efficacy of the SE intervention on maternal, fetal, and neonatal composite outcomes compared
to eUC. Aim 3: To explore the relationship between adherence and cardiovascular measures and pregnancy
complications. Our goals fit NINRâs strategic goal of promoting health and preventing illness across health
conditions, settings, the lifespan, and in minority and underserved populations, who bear higher burden of obesity.
Stretching exercise may be viable for preventing cardiovascular illness and is known to have high acceptance,
better adherence, no known untoward side effects, and promising preliminary evidence of effectiveness."
10864799,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The breast lobules are the structures that produce milk in lactating women, and are also the primary
site of origin for breast cancer. Age-related lobular involution (LI) is a physiological process in which the
epithelial tissue of the breast lobules gradually regresses with age, corresponding with elimination of the need
for milk production beyond the child-bearing years. Analysis of our cohort of more than 14,000 women with
benign breast disease (BBD) revealed that LI is strongly associated with reduced risk of subsequent breast
cancer, and thus LI constitutes a natural mechanism for prevention of breast cancer. However, more than 40%
of postmenopausal women with BBD have not completed LI, and these women are at substantially greater risk
of developing breast cancer compared to women of similar age whose involution process has completed. In
this application, we propose experiments to identify critical effectors of LI and to determine how these can be
used to improve breast cancer risk assessment for women who have not undergone LI. In Aim 1, we will define
the mediators that underlie the link between delayed LI and a high risk cellular phenotype. We will use a newly-
generated panel of very early passage primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) derived from women
with BBD and varying degrees of LI, in combination with humanized mouse xenograft models in which the LI
status of the HMECs is manifest. In Aim 2, we will identify mediators associated with ongoing vs delayed LI in a
newly-defined clinical cohort of peri- and post-menopausal women for whom multiple, sequential benign
biopsies are available. In Aim 3, biomarkers discovered in Aims 1 and 2 (plus other promising biomarkers) will
be evaluated for association with subsequent breast cancer in a patient cohort of postmenopausal women.
The cohorts interrogated in Aims 2 and 3 will be drawn both from the Mayo Clinic BBD cohort, which is
primarily composed of White/Caucasian women, and the Detroit BBD cohort, which is composed of
Black/African-American women, which will allow us to evaluate race as a biological variable in our analyses. By
providing insight into the processes that control LI and by developing tractable experimental models in which to
evaluate the effects of modulating those processes, our work will provide a better understanding of LI delay
and its link to breast cancer and will point toward methods for inducing LI in women for whom this process is
stalled or delayed, as a physiologically-derived method for breast cancer prevention."
10773132,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Growing advances in imaging and fluid-based assays of Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers including amyloid,
tau and neurodegeneration, confirm that AD processes begin decades before clinical impairment in cognitive
function. Subtle changes to cognition are also likely to co-occur years before a clinical diagnosis of dementia
due to AD. There is an urgent need to develop sensitive measures of subtle cognitive decline associated with
AD biomarkers, particularly for monitoring response to early intervention treatments in clinical trials. The
proposed investigation is highly innovative and designed to leverage existing data from three longitudinal cohort
studiesâWisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention, Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, and
BIOCARDâusing a classic and widely used measure of cognition: the story recall task. We developed a novel
scoring system that we hypothesize targets semantic and associative memory processes: measures that capture
lexical categories and serial position. Our preliminary data shows that proper name recall and serial position
scores from story recall are significantly associated with beta-amyloid status from positron emission tomography
(PET), while the traditional total score was not related to amyloid status. In this proposal, our central hypothesis
is that item-level analysis of existing story recall data from several longitudinal cohorts will yield one or more new
measures of cognition that are uniquely associated with underlying preclinical AD pathology. The specific aims
are: Aim1: Use data from multiple cohort studies to a) replicate preliminary findings that lexical-level and serial
position markers from delayed story recall are associated with increased risk of amyloid positivity and b) extend
analyses to investigate whether these variables are associated with PET tau, CSF AÎ² and tau, or MRI
neurodegeneration measures. Aim 2: Compare concurrent and predictive validity of measures to determine
whether the novel measures are more strongly associated with biomarkers, cognitive decline, or progression to
clinical levels of impairment than traditional total score measures. Aim 3: Enhance the lexical-level and serial
position analysis with computational linguistic analysis of digitally recorded speech from story recall to determine
whether semantic content, speech fluency, error-monitoring, and serial position recall explain unique variance in
levels of amyloid and/or tau pathology. Impact: The proposed project leverages existing data and is expected to
lead to the development of new outcome measures from a classic, commonly used test that has played a central
role in detection of disease. We expect that our higher-level language and process-based measures will be
sensitive to AD biomarkers in preclinical phases of cognitive decline. By utilizing existing resources from differing
cohorts, we can validate our findings without adding participant burden, share these methods with other cohort
studies, further develop a digital marker of speech and cognition, and contribute an improved understanding of
the underlying mechanisms of memory and communication breakdowns in preclinical AD."

The objective of this K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is to assist the
candidate in acquiring expertise and methodological skills to become an independent implementation science
investigator focused on integrated substance use disorder and HIV care practices. The objective of the
candidateâs research is two-fold: to reduce the detrimental impact of methamphetamine use while simultaneously
supporting engagement in HIV care. People with HIV who use methamphetamine are susceptible to experiencing
gaps at each stage of the HIV care continuum. Contingency management is an effective behavioral therapy for
methamphetamine use disorder that is based on operant conditioning principles. Contingency management
decreases the reinforcing effects of methamphetamine use by providing immediate, positive reinforcement
following abstinence from substance use. Incentive-based interventions based on operant conditioning principles
also demonstrate positive effects for improving antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence. It remains unclear
whether a contingency management program that integrates incentives for ART adherence (CM+ART, i.e.,
dually targeting methamphetamine use and ART adherence) is more acceptable and appropriate to people with
HIV than a contingency management program targeting methamphetamine use only. The specific aims of the
research plan for the five-year K23 award period are: 1) to identify resources required to implement contingency
management programs in settings serving people with HIV, 2) to adapt contingency management to integrate
incentives for adherence to ART (CM+ART), and 3) to evaluate whether CM+ART is acceptable and appropriate
to people with HIV who use methamphetamine compared to a contingency management program targeting only
reductions in methamphetamine use. Dr. Montoyaâs mentored training plan, including formal didactics and other
activities, aligns with the research aims and career development plans and has four key areas: 1) to deepen
knowledge of evidence-based practices implemented at local and national levels to support patient engagement
in HIV and substance use disorder care, 2) to apply an implementation science approach to guide adaptation of
contingency management to integrate incentives for ART adherence, 3) to acquire advanced methodological
skills to design and evaluate mixed-method studies and clinical trials, and 4) to engage in professional
development activities geared toward development of a competitive NIDA R01 application and an independent
research career. This proposal strongly aligns with NIDA Strategic Plan Objectives 3.1 (âDevelop and test novel
treatments based on the science of addictionâ) and 3.4 (âDevelop and test strategies for effectively and
sustainably implementing evidence-based treatmentsâ); the NIH Office of AIDS Research priority to address HIV-
associated comorbidities such as substance use disorders; and the âEnding the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for
Americaâ initiative. The comprehensive training activities and research plan will effectively position the candidate
for an independent research career focused on the integration of HIV and substance use disorder care."
10818477,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Metastatic disease remains the major cause of cancer-related death. Among the vital organs to which solid
tumors metastasize, the lung is one of the most common. Lung metastases frequently occur in various late
stage solid cancers including breast cancer. In the past 20 years, significant advances in lung metastasis
research have revealed intricate interactions between the disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) and the lung
microenvironment that are essential for the development of metastatic lung lesions. In particular, formation of
the immunosuppressive lung pre-metastatic microenvironment (niche), which is driven by factors secreted by
primary tumors, is regarded as a key preparation stage prior to the arrival of DTCs. The focus of this proposal
will be on the lung resident mesenchymal cells (MCs), an under-characterized stromal cell population within
the lung pre-metastatic niche. Preliminary studies in mouse models of breast cancer suggest that lung resident
MCs serve as a driver of immunosuppressive pre-metastatic niche formation by reprogramming diverse types
of myeloid cells to become highly immunosuppressive or tolerogenic. The central hypothesis of this proposal is
that lung resident MCs drive formation of the lung pre-metastatic niche by endowing diverse infiltrating
myeloid cells with an immunosuppressive capacity. To test this hypothesis and uncover mechanisms by
which MCs modulate myeloid cells, we propose three Specific Aims. Aim 1: Determine the lung resident MC
changes in the pre-metastatic niche using genetic manipulation of endogenous MCs in mice. We will
use orthotopic breast tumor cell implantation and genetically engineered mouse (GEM) tumor models to
measure the endogenous MC changes at the pre-metastatic stage. MCs will also be ablated in vivo to
determine their necessity for pre-metastatic niche formation. Aim 2: Characterize the key lung
mesenchymal factors that recruit and modulate myeloid cells. We will use RNA sequencing to profile
transcriptome changes between endogenous MCs residing in pre-metastatic vs. normal lungs to identify
upregulated genes that might play a role in modulating myeloid cells. The contribution of candidate MC genes
to pre-metastatic niche formation will be evaluated through MC-specific gene knockout. Aim 3: Target lung
MCs as a strategy for abolishing the immunosuppressive lung pre-metastatic niche in preclinical
models. Using orthotopic tumor implantation models, we will test the ability of lung MC blockade agents to
boost lung anti-tumor immunity and prevent lung metastasis. These studies will be a significant step toward our
long-term goal to fully dissect the roles of organ-specific stromal cells in organ-tropic metastases of breast
cancer. We anticipate that our findings will establish a strong foundation for the development of novel
therapeutic strategies that target stromal factors for the prevention and treatment of lung metastases of breast
cancer and other solid tumors."

Members of the voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs) are critical for electrical and chemical signaling throughout
the three kingdoms of life. Dysfunction of ion channels underlie a wide range of pathophysiology and they are
one of the primary targets for new drug development. Although they share a common membrane architecture,
the channels in this superfamily exhibit surprising diversity of function. Most open in response to a membrane
depolarization but some open on hyperpolarization. Many of them are also polymodal- their activity is regulated
by second messengers such as cyclic nucleotide or a physical stimulus such as temperature. The main objective
of this proposal is to probe the molecular driving forces in order to understand the fundamental mechanisms of
voltage-gating and its modulation by temperature and ligand. Current mechanistic approach tends to be structure
focused to the extent that protein dynamics is either ignored or treated as secondary. Although the structures of
many highly temperature-sensitive ion channels are now available, our understanding of the mechanism of tem-
perature-sensitivity remains limited, in large part, due to our inability to directly probe the molecular forces. To
address this issue, we are using a multi-pronged approach that combines new and existing tools to systematically
characterize the molecular interactions that determine polarity of voltage-gating, exquisite temperature-sensitiv-
ity and unusual allostery in VGICs. We are using the HCN channel as a model system to study gating polarity
and ligand activation. Using zero model waveguides and newly developed high-throughput analysis algorithms
we were able to probe the cooperativity of ligand binding in a model system. We are now poised to extend these
studies to full-length channels and receptors. With regards to mechanisms of gating polarity, we have made a
surprising discovery that a bipartite switch regulates gating polarity in HCN channels. Microsecond scale simu-
lations in Anton supercomputer suggest a gating model which we will be tested further. We will carry out structural
studies and combine it with voltage clamp fluorometry in order to annotate these structures. Next, we will also
use ancestral protein reconstruction approach, to identify the deep allosteric networks that regulate gating po-
larity in these channels. Our studies on temperature-dependent gating is based on two model systems: a) Tem-
perature-sensitive Shaker mutant and, b) archaeal MthK channel. In order to determine the essential elements
that are responsible for âsensingâ temperature, we have to measure the thermodynamic properties such as heat
capacity. We propose to develop a new approach involving single molecule force spectroscopy to extract these
energetic parameters. Overall, our âmolecular forcesâ focused approach has the potential to provide unparalleled
insights into the mechanisms of voltage gating and its regulation by temperature in VGICs."
10873668,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide. Despite
recent scientific advances, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the immune mechanisms
responsible for control and eradication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. PLWH with latent TB
infection (LTBI) have a ~10% annual risk of progressing to TB disease, however currently available tests for
LTBI diagnosis have reduced sensitivity in this population and are not able to predict which latently infected
individuals are at highest risk for developing TB for targeted preventive therapy. Emerging data from
clinically relevant animal models suggest that LTBI and active TB represent a spectrum of immune
responses and host pathology, with increasing metabolic changes and immune dysregulation during the
transition to TB disease. We have identified unique serum metabolite and microRNA (miRNA) profiles that
are able to discriminate between patients with TB and those with non-TB lung disease. However, these
novel TB signatures have not been assessed prospectively to identify PLWH and HIV-negative persons with
LTBI who are at increased risk for TB progression. In order to address this significant knowledge gap, in Aim
1 of the current research program, trainees will leverage the Indian and South African RePORT longitudinal
biorepositories of household contacts of TB index cases to test the hypothesis that TB is a chronic
inflammatory disease associated with profound changes in immune regulation and metabolism prior to the
onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Another major barrier to global TB eradication efforts is the lengthy
and complicated current anti-tubercular regimen, which is associated with medical nonadherence and the
emergence of drug resistance. Recently, attention has focused on host-directed adjunctive therapies aimed
at optimizing immune responses to the pathogen and improving lung damage. Lipid-laden macrophages
(foam cells) are central to maintaining chronic TB infection by providing a favorable niche in which
antimicrobial functions are down-regulated, and by inducing caseation and tissue damage. Recent work has
shown that foam-cell-rich and necrotic areas of TB granulomas are particularly enriched in triglycerides. Mtb
infection is associated with dysregulation of two cellular pathways involved in triglyceride homeostasis: a
pro-lipogenic pathway involving protein kinase B and mTOR complex 1 (Akt/mTORC1), and an anti-
lipogenic pathway involving AMP-activated protein kinase and the sirtuins (AMPK/SIRT). In Aim 2, trainees
will use longitudinal clinical samples from RePORT study participants and experimental infections ex vivo to
characterize: (i) the relationship between activation of these pathways and control of clinical Mtb infection,
and the effect of anti-lipogenic treatments on antimycobacterial functions of human macrophages infected
ex vivo. The research aims will be integrated with a mentoring strategy for mentees that fosters
development of high impact patient-oriented research with a pathway to independence."
10683717,"The goal of this application is to improve our understanding of the genetic basis of pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic cancer is currently the 3rd leading cause of cancer death in the United States and it is projected
there will be 56,770 new pancreatic cancer diagnosed in the United States in 2019. Over the past decade the
incidence of pancreatic cancer has been steadily increasing. Despite the fact that pancreatic cancer incidence
rates are higher among African Americans compared to the US White population there have been no large-
scale genetic studies of pancreatic cancer in African Americans conducted to date. Furthermore, the relative
rarity of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer (PDAC) and the rapidly fatal disease course has resulted in
limited samples sizes for all prior genome-wide association studies regardless of ancestral population. As
such many common PDAC loci have yet to be identified due to limited statistical power. Large-scale, diverse
collaborative studies of PDAC, are needed to dramatically increase our understanding of the inherited basis of
this deadly disease. Our proposal is designed to specifically address this need. First, we will conduct the first
genetic study of pancreatic cancer risk specifically focused on African Americans through whole genome
sequencing. As part of this study we are bringing together African American pancreatic cancer patients and
controls from our two, large established, successful pancreatic cancer consortiums, the Pancreatic Cancer
Cohort Consortium and the Pancreatic Cancer Case Control Consortium (PanC4). Secondly, we also expand
our power to detect pancreatic cancer association across all ethnic groups by doubling the size of prior GWAS
studies and conducting the first multi-ethnic genetic study of pancreatic cancer risk. We will conduct both
ancestry stratified and ancestry-informed analysis including both single variant and gene-based tests of
association of pancreatic cancer patients and controls. In addition, we will conduct gene x environment
interaction analysis with known risk factors of smoking, BMI, diabetes, and alcohol intake. The specific aims of
the project are to: Aim 1: To identify pancreatic cancer susceptibility loci in the African American population,
Aim 2: To identify novel pancreatic cancer loci through multi-ethnic GWAS analyses; Aim 3: To fine-map
regions associated with pancreatic cancer risk. In summary, this application seeks to identify novel pancreatic
cancer loci, conduct the first genetic analysis of pancreatic cancer in individuals of African Ancestry, and
leverage cross population genetic diversity to fine-map known pancreatic cancer susceptibility loci.

10862554,"Abstract
Viral respiratory infections are responsible for major morbidity and mortality in early life. Infants account for a
significant proportion of influenza hospitalizations and are considered a top high-risk group. In addition to the
acute morbidity, initial immune responses to influenza shape/imprint the immune system and affect subsequent
responses to influenza infections and vaccinations, which tend to induce humoral responses skewed towards
epitopes present in the first influenza antigen encountered. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection in infants is
generally mild and less severe than in older individuals. This is remarkable and suggests that there are unique
features on how the infant immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2, compared to its responses against other
respiratory viruses, that can be leveraged to improve our understanding of early life immunity.
On the basis of these observations, we hypothesize that early life viral respiratory infections elicit virus-specific
immune responses that lead to distinct immune developmental trajectories. To address this hypothesis, we will
compare three longitudinal cohorts: i) infants infected with SARS-CoV-2; ii) infants infected with influenza virus;
and as reference iii) healthy infants with none of those two infections. After acute infection children will be
followed longitudinally for three years and immune responses assessed in the context of influenza and COVID-
19 vaccinations.
We designed two integrated research projects, supported by three cores. Project 1 will define: 1) the differences
of blood transcriptional immune signatures in infants with SARS-CoV-2 versus infants with influenza infection;
2) the magnitude, immunodominance pattern and breath of the antibody responses to influenza virus and
evolution of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2; and 3) perform high-throughput longitudinal evaluation of B
cell responses to influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Project 2 will: 1) Assess the blood cell composition, transcriptome
and epigenome in response to influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infection occurring in the first six months of life at the
single cell level; and 2) Characterize the PBMC phenotype/cell composition, transcriptome and epigenome in
response to vaccination against influenza and SARS-CoV-2."

Tobacco use remains a leading cause of preventable premature death in the United States, especially for
racial/ethnic minorities and low-income populations. Public and multiunit housing are closely tied to tobacco-
related disparities as vulnerable populations are most likely to live in multiunit housing with the highest rates of
smoking and secondhand smoke exposure, while also the least likely to have access to smoke-free home
environments. For example, New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) residents smoke at higher rates, report
higher secondhand smoke exposure from an outside source and are surrounded by high density tobacco retail
environments compared to other New Yorkers. Public housing is at the forefront of the smoke-free policy
movement. In 2016, HUD mandated that all housing authorities adopt smoke-free policies, which affects all
3,300 housing authorities and 1.2 million households nationwide. NYCHA is the largest public housing provider
in the nation; it houses more than 400,000 people in 326 public housing developments spanning over 2,400
buildings citywide. As of July 2018, all NYCHA housing units adopted a smoke-free policy affecting all
properties. The implementation of this policy, the largest of its kind, represents a critical opportunity to examine
and reduce public housing-related tobacco hazards. To date, no randomized controlled trials (RCT) have been
conducted to test the effects of compliance strategies on resident smoking behavior and secondhand smoke
exposure. The proposed design will be a borough-stratified, four-arm, factorial-design, cluster RCT that will
target 128 randomly selected buildings (32 buildings per arm) in separate NYCHA developments. We will
recruit and follow 8 randomly selected residents stratified by smoking status- 4 smokers and 4 non-smokers-
per building (n=1024) into four arms: (1) relocation/cessation, (2) resident endorsement, (3) relocation/
cessation plus resident endorsement and (4)the standard approach (256 participants per arm). Outcomes
will be assessed longitudinally using salivary cotinine and resident surveys to measure smoking behaviors and
secondhand smoke exposures at 4 time points: baseline, 2, 6 and 12 months post-intervention. Qualitative
data will also be collected via key informant interviews, focus groups and sensory observations of buildings.
This mixed methods, pre-post with comparison RCT design overseen by a highly experienced, interdisciplinary
team in partnership with NYCHA and a stakeholder advisory board. Aims include to experimentally test if policy
compliance interventions reduce personal smoking behavior (Aim 1); reduce secondhand smoke exposure
(Aim 2), and determine if the tobacco retail environment surrounding each building moderates the relationship
between compliance interventions and smoking-related outcomes (Aim 3). This comprehensive, community
engaged and social-ecologically informed RCT supports the design and implementation of interventions to
optimize smoke-free housing compliance for populations with high burdens of tobacco-related disparities."

 Biofilm bacteria cause two-thirds of infections in modern clinical practice, including wound and device-
related infections. Host defenses and most available antibiotics are inactive against biofilms, rendering the
infections they cause challenging to treat. Given the failure of antibiotics in management of biofilm-associated
infections, novel and innovative approaches are needed. Avoiding antibiotics will also decrease the dysbiosis
and selection of genotypic antibiotic resistance linked to their use. We are developing electrical anti-biofilm
strategies. In the original funding period, we developed the âelectricidal effect,â which uses fixed direct current
(DC). Though fixed DC exhibited activity in vitro and in animal models of orthopedic foreign body infection,
concerns about mechanistic non-specificity, and challenges in clinical delivery for orthopedic infections (at least
as an initial application), led us to propose a new approach. Here, we propose a mechanistically-precise
electrochemical strategy (distinct from fixed DC), that will specifically deliver one or the other (or both) of two
anti-biofilm chemicals â hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and/or hypochlorous acid (HOCl). We have also moved to a
more clinically feasible target â wound infections. Our new approach employs a completely novel, tunable â
potential-controlled â electrochemical system, which will cleanly deliver continuous low concentrations of H2O2
and/or HOCl, suitable for biofilm killing, without compromising wound healing. Importantly, both chemicals have
applications in wound care, but use has been hindered by rapid decomposition of their raw chemical forms. To
bring together the biology, microbiology, electrochemistry, engineering and animal model expertise required for
our studies, we are newly collaborating with an electrochemist and biofilm engineer, Haluk Beyenal, PhD. In
collaboration, we will develop scalable electrochemical bandages (e-bandages) composed of carbon fibers that
will generate sustained, controlled quantities of H2O2 and/or HOCl in the presence of specific applied potential,
providing an easy-to-use, antibiotic-free approach for treatment of infected wounds and promotion of wound
healing. The technology being applied was not available in the prior funding period. We have built prototype
devices that generate continuous, controlled concentrations of H2O2 or HOCl (based on applied potential) in
amounts that reduce biofilms. Both H2O2- and HOCl-generating prototypes reduced Acinetobacter baumannii,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus biofilms in vitro. Further, the HOCl-generating
prototype reduced the number of live bacterial cells of all three species on porcine dermal explants, and the
H2O2-generating prototype did the same against A. baumannii on explants, without damaging the animal
tissue. In Aim 1, we will build e-bandages and confirm, using in vitro studies, their biofilm treatment properties,
tuning them to ensure lack of toxicity. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate activity and safety of the e-bandages in a
murine wound infection model. Our goal is to have a product ready for human testing at the end of our studies."

To achieve aspirational goals to end the HIV epidemic (EHE), evidence-based practices (EBPs) to increase viral
suppression must be implemented effectively nationally. The Managed Problem Solving (MAPS) behavioral
intervention is an EBP for behavior change in people living with HIV (PLWH). To accomplish the goals of this
application, we leverage a data-to-care partnership between the Philadelphia Department of Public Health
(PDPH) and participating clinics (n = 12), which enhances the sustainability of our approach. We propose that
MAPS can be delivered by trained Community Health Workers (CHWs). The use of CHWs to deliver MAPS is
justified by their ability to develop trusting relationships with their clients and the need for task shifting in busy
clinics. In order to also address retention in care, we will adapt MAPS to also focus on problem solving activities
tailored toward retention in care (now termed MAPS+). CHWs will be located in clinics to implement MAPS+ to
improve viral suppression and care retention in PLWH. Data-to-care allows for identification of people who are
lost to care and link these patients back to care. Currently, medication adherence and retention in HIV care are
not targeted in data-to-care so we will build on this approach to facilitate the identification of PLWH who are out
of care and not virally suppressed to offer them MAPS+. Our set of implementation strategies include task-
shifting the delivery of MAPS+ to CHWs, providing the CHWs training and ongoing support, and increasing
communication between the CHWs and medical care team via standardized protocols. We will conduct a hybrid
type II effectiveness-implementation trial with a stepped-wedge cluster randomized design in 12 clinics to test
MAPS+ compared to usual care using a set of implementation strategies that we believe will best support
implementation. Each clinic will be randomized to one of three implementation start times. We will collect baseline
(usual care) data from each clinic for 6 months, followed by MAPS+ and our package of implementation
strategies for 12 months, in three cohorts of 4 clinics each. Aim 1 will test the effectiveness of MAPS+ on clinical
effectiveness outcomes, including viral suppression (primary) and retention (secondary). Aim 2 will examine the
effect of the package of implementation strategies on reach. We will also measure implementation cost. Aim 3
will apply a qualitative approach to understand processes, mechanisms, and sustainment of our implementation
approach. Our results will guide future efforts to implement behavioral EBPs across the HIV care continuum,
consistent with the âtreatâ pillar of EHE, and move the science of implementation services, consistent with NIH
strategic priorities."

Autoreactive B cells play critical roles in many autoimmune diseases. Multiple immune tolerance
checkpoints exist to remove autoreactive B cells or keep them under control. Defects in these checkpoints
constitute the basis for the development of autoimmune diseases. Despite intensive study, our
understanding of these checkpoints remains incomplete and fragmentary. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a new
class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate a large diversity of biological processes. Hundreds of miRNAs
are expressed in the immune system. While some miRNAs have been shown to play important roles in
lymphocyte development and function, the roles of miRNAs in controlling immune tolerance remain poorly
understood. We performed in vivo functional analysis of hundreds of miRNAs in the recently established
IgMb-macroself mouse model and identified miR-148a as an important regulator of B cell central tolerance
and autoimmunity (Nature Immunology 17:433-40, 2016). Further molecular analysis identified 119 target
genes regulated by miR-148a in immature B cells. We examined 4 of these target genes and demonstrated
that 3 of them, Gadd45a, Bim and Pten, regulate B cell central tolerance. In this proposal, we will 1) further
investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying miR-148a regulation of immune tolerance
and autoimmunity, focusing on its role in controlling various B cell tolerance checkpoints and plasma cell
differentiation; 2) evaluate the possibility of treating systemic autoimmunity through miR-148a ablation and
inhibition by genetic and chemical approaches, respectively, and 3) perform an in vitro functional screen of
the other 115 miR-148a target genes to identify novel regulators of B cell tolerance. Our pilot screen has
identified B4galt5 as a positive hit. As B4galt5 is a major enzyme in the glycolipid biosynthesis pathway, we
speculate that this pathway plays important roles in immune tolerance. Therefore, we will elucidate the
function and mechanism of B4galt5 and the glycolipid biosynthesis pathway in controlling B cell tolerance
and autoimmunity."

Bladder cancer (BCa) is a common solid tumor and exhibits poor outcomes when regionally advanced or
metastatic. Only modest improvements are seen even with aggressive surgical or medical treatments. Most
patients with advanced cancer ultimately succumb to their disease with the most significant prognostic factor
being the presence of metastasis. While much work has been done on identifying the presence of metastatic
tumor cells in lymph nodes, little research currently explores the mechanisms that govern BCa progression to a
metastatic phenotype. It is now well recognized that genetic factors, intrinsic to the primary tumor, and
microenvironmental factors, independent of the primary tumor are involved in metastatic progression. One key
understudied regulator of metastatic efficiency may be mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Variations in mitochondrial
copy number and loss of mtDNA have been implicated as pathogenic events in BCa, and changes in mtDNA
have been measured in patient samples; however, little is understood about the functional contribution of mtDNA
to metastatic progression due to lack of suitable and available laboratory models. We have developed a model
to determine contributions of mtDNA, designated MNX â mitochondrial-nuclear exchange. Transgenic mice are
generated with matched nuclear DNA but different mtDNA from separate strains such that maternal inheritance
determines mtDNA content in constant nuclear backgrounds. Prior studies from the Welch lab (mPI) using these
mice in breast and melanoma models indicate mtDNA is a novel metastasis efficiency regulator. Moreover,
mtDNA changes in the microenvironment independent of the tumor itself may further regulate the potential for
metastasis. However, no such studies have been done in genetically credentialed models that accurately
recapitulate human disease. Our preliminary data indicates that transfer of C3H/HeN mtDNA into a C57Bl/6J
nuclear background results in more rapid tumor progression, especially in female mice. We hypothesize that
specifically altering mitochondrial genetics will fundamentally alter tumor progression and metastasis
rates in BCa via signaling changes in both tumor cells and the tumor stroma. We will use the highly
credentialed N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN) induced BCa model in murine strains with different
rates of tumor formation (C3H/HeN and C57BL/6J) to investigate this hypothesis. In Specific Aim 1, we will
evaluate the role of mtDNA in primary BCa tumor progression to metastasis using WT and MNX mice. In Specific
Aim 2, we will determine the contribution of cellular and stromal elements to BCa metastasis in WT and MNX
mice. These studies will define the role of mtDNA in this model and lead to future experiments understanding
how loss or gain of mtDNA specifically effects both murine laboratory models and patients."

Institute (Texas Biomed) will attract the next generation of diverse researchers to the tuberculosis (TB) research
field, and develop them into independent researchers with multi-disciplinary skills and real-world experience of
clinical TB. The product of IN-TRAC will be researchers that choose to work on some of the most challenging
and relevant translational problems in TB, and that work across academic disciplines and within a framework of
highly collaborative research. This will be achieved through 6 interrelated Cores. Administrative Core: The
central hub of IN-TRAC management and oversight, with responsibility for administrative and scientific
leadership; coordinating communication between Cores, researchers and NIH/NIAID Program staff and
providing an organizational structure to optimize multidisciplinary collaborations and interactions between the
Cores and among a diverse cohort of IN-TRAC participants. Development Core: Oversight of all career
development programming and courses, tailoring the research and clinical experiences, both intern and
externships, to each individual IN-TRAC participant, and management of the IN-TRAC pilot grant program.
Biosafety & Biocontainment Core: Extending the required biosafety training to a personalized curriculum
including theoretical and hands-on biocontainment training, understanding the mechanical and regulatory
requirements of a BSL3/ABSL3, coaching on how to develop biosafety protocols, and working through risk
assessments from the perspective of a Biosafety Officer. Research Imaging Core: Providing theoretical and
hands-on training from single cell imaging (confocal microscopy, cytometry, live cell imaging, single cell RNAseq)
through to whole body imaging in mice (IVIS) and Non-human primates (NHP) (PET/CT) within large, fully
outfitted BSL3/ABSL3 facilities. Animal Model Core: Implementing a training program to introduce all IN-TRAC
participants to the regulatory requirements for working with rodents and NHPs, how to develop a robust
experimental protocol, how to write an IACUC protocol, and hands-on animal handling and experimental
procedures. Clinical Research & Patient Care Core: Introducing IN-TRAC participants to TB patient care at
the only free-standing TB hospital in the US (Texas Center of Infectious Diseases) that manages some of the
most challenging cases of TB nationally. Partnering with this will be a clinical research experience at the US-
Mexico border, to experience TB studies in under-served and under-resourced communities."
10703204,"Background: Opioid prescribing has declined 64% between 2012 and 2020 in the Veterans Administration
(VA),1 with high dose prescriptions declining 77%. Although this change likely will prevent prescription-related
harm to Veterans, some reports signal adverse events - events that are not well understood - including suicide.
Where harm has occurred, it is crucial to know what factors, modifiable and nonmodifiable, played a role.
Efforts to examine causal mechanisms for suicide through trials present ethical challenges. Large database
assessments may not reveal crucial information that is lacking from medical records. Psychological autopsy
research provides a method to collect and analyze discrete, descriptive data concerning the clinical contexts
for suicide during opioid transitions, including taper or stoppage.
Significance: The solicitation to which this proposal responds (HX-21-024) prioritizes learning about âbenefits
and harms of tapering and/or discontinuation.â At present, several federal agencies have declared a
commitment to averting suicide during opioid taper. But thus far, we lack a deep understanding as to why the
suicides occur, which makes preventive and mitigating action difficult to plan. The next logical step in preparing
a health system response is in-depth study of the events themselves.
Innovation and Impact: Whereas much research has gone toward discerning statistical associations between
prescription opioid change and outcomes (including suicide), this project takes a different approach, by
applying techniques of psychological autopsy. The pre-requisite challenge to such research is the ability to
recruit bereaved survivors who may perceive stigma and who often harbor distrust of health care systems. Our
team has invested years in building connections to the community, and allying with suicidologists, so that
recruitment becomes possible. Also, by assessing differences between Veteran and non-Veteran suicides, we
are positioned to assist VA of its unique assets and liabilities, with the goal of mitigating the latter.
Specific Aims:
Aim 1. Characterize the patient and clinical context factors associated with suicide among 100 persons (50
Veterans and 50 non-Veterans) who have died by suicide in the context of opioid transition (stoppage or
reduction) through survey, structured interview of bereaved family members, and medical record review.
Aim 2. Identify factors that may be unique to suicides following opioid transition in Veterans as opposed to
non-Veterans, with attention to differences in experience for Veterans in and outside of VA care.
Methodology: We will recruit, from the public, family survivors of Veterans and non-Veterans with pain who
have died by suicide in the context of an opioid transition. We will work with survivors to solicit medical records
from within or outside VA, to review them, and to carry out structured interviews traditional for psychological
autopsy. From review of the resulting reports, a multidisciplinary research team (including experts in opioid
taper, suicide, addiction, health services research and medical anthropology) will apply the Social-Ecological
Framework to identify common personal and contextual factors, to identify aspects of clinical interaction that
appear salient to these events, and to identify notable contrasts between those suicides occurring among
Veterans as opposed to non-Veterans during opioid transition.
Next Steps/Implementation: We intend to present findings quarterly to our patient/family Stakeholder Team
and to VA partners (Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, VA National Program Director for
Pain Management), so that early and actionable insights are triaged for action. The collation of our research
findings and our stakeholder response and feedback allows this project to serve as the first step of the
Intervention Mapping process (âNeeds Assessmentâ), which leads in turn to design of preferred outcomes,
intervention design and testing."
10662207,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Despite federal cannabis prohibition, an increasing number of states are implementing
or considering cannabis legalization. Washington and Oregon were among the first states to
legalize, in 2012 and 2014. Jurisdictions in the U.S. and abroad are looking to the early state
adopters to identify best practices for state and local policy, and to learn about the impact of
cannabis legalization beyond the short-term.
 In response to state legalization of recreational cannabis, many communities in
Washington and Oregon have initiated additional regulatory policies or taxes. Currently, there is
no evidence base to predict the effectiveness of such local policy actions for moderating public
health or social outcomes that may follow cannabis legalization.
 The Aims of the proposed study are to:
1) Monitor and document local-level changes in cannabis policies, prices, and market activities
(e.g., density, sales) in Oregon and Washington.
2) Assess how local variation in cannabis policies, prices, and market activities in Oregon and
Washington affect cannabis use and related health outcomes beyond the short-term (5-10 years
after legalization) among youth, pregnant and parenting women, and adults.
3) Estimate the short-term and longer-term effects of local-level cannabis policies, prices and
market activities on the prevalence and frequency of alcohol and tobacco use among youth,
pregnant women, new mothers, and all adults, as well as substance use treatment and
hospitalizations related to alcohol and opioids in Oregon and Washington.
 We will address these aims using quasi-experimental methods and geospatial analyses
that exploit within-state and across-time variation in cannabis policies, prices, and market
activities. We will collect and review local marijuana policies in both states, retailer-level
licensing and transaction data, and assess their association with relevant behavioral, public
health and social outcomes. We will rely on multiple established public health surveillance and
other data reporting systems, which are largely common across both states.
 Findings from this study will provide policymakers and other stakeholders with strong
evidence about the effectiveness of local cannabis policies on public health outcomes."

Increasing evidence has demonstrated that the dynamical behaviors of kinase signaling, i.e., kinetic patterns of
activation/deactivation process, can dictate the cells' responses to different perturbations. Understanding such
dynamics can help to predict cell fates, such as live/dead outcomes of drug treatments. However, this task
requires resolving single-cell kinase signaling dynamics in the context of cellular phenotypes, which is
technologically challenging. Although genetically encoded reporting systems can address some of the needs, its
implementation is restricted to easily transfectable cell lines, thereby limiting its translational impacts. To
overcome those challenges, our group has developed a chemical method for studying kinase signaling activities
in living single cells, using cyclic peptide-based imaging probes. In this MIRA proposal, we seek to expand the
chemical toolkit to include multicyclic peptide-based affinity tags and develop a repertoire of highly specific
imaging probes (Project 1a). We will also explore chemical strategies to devise a universal probe delivery tag
(Project 1b). By combining these tools with other well-established single-cell technologies and multivariate
analysis methods, we plan to address two outstanding biological questions: How do the unique kinetic features
of protein kinase signaling activities link to phenotypical heterogeneity (Project 2)? How does diverse kinase
signaling dynamics orchestrate cellular responses to external perturbations, such as live/dead outcomes of
targeted kinase inhibitors (Project 3)? To answer those questions, we performed preliminary studies focusing on
AKT signaling using a human glioblastoma cell line. We found that inhibiting AKT or its upstream signaling protein
(EGFR) can both significantly change the kinetic features of AKT signaling. We also demonstrated that a neural
network algorithm could predict whether a cell can survive AKT inhibition, using the kinetic patterns of AKT
signaling profile as the input. Based on our data, we propose two hypotheses: First, the pattern of kinase
signaling kinetics is shaped by the abundance and activities of upstream signaling proteins. Second, early
responses in kinase signaling govern therapeutic outcomes of targeted kinase inhibitors. In projects 2&3, we will
test those hypotheses by studying kinase signaling dynamics in a panel of cell lines, with and without external
perturbations. We will initiate the studies with a focus on AKT signaling, and as new imaging probes from Project
1 become available, we will expand our work to include other signaling modules. Successful execution of the
proposed research will provide a suite of novel chemical probes and enabling technologies for interrogating
kinase signaling dynamics at single-cell resolution. It will also generate insights into how such dynamics connects
to phenotypical heterogeneity and governs specific cellular responses."

Water fluoridation is controversial. Over the past decade, concern about the potential toxicity of
fluoride has grown, but there are still questions. Most human studies of fluoride toxicity only
studied children who were exposed to high levels of fluoride and only a few studies measured
fluoride exposure during critical periods of development. Urine, which is commonly used to
quantify a personâs exposure to fluoride, reflects recent exposure and requires serial sampling to
measure fluoride during different periods of development. Our proposed study will analyze tooth
dentin â the tissue that lies beneath enamel â to measure the level and timing of fluoride
exposure. Tooth dentin is an optimal biomarker because it provides a historical record of both
serial and cumulative exposure to ingested fluoride. We will test the following specific aims:
Aim 1. To quantify prenatal, early childhood, and cumulative fluoride exposure levels using shed
baby teeth collected from 800 children; Aim 2. To test whether dentin fluoride concentrations in
baby teeth is associated with lower IQ scores (n=610) and attention problems (n=898); Aim 3.
To test whether the urinary and dentin fluoride concentrations impact thyroid hormones, and
ultimately IQ scores and attention problems. This study is innovative because it will employ
state-of the-art analytical methods to measure the level and precise timing of exposures to
fluoride and toxic metals in tooth dentin. The study capitalizes on an existing Canadian
pregnancy and birth cohort, the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals. We will
leverage existing data from our ongoing NIH-funded study to find out if fluoride exposure during
early brain growth alters childrenâs IQ scores and behavioral problems. In addition, we will test
the endocrine disrupting potential of fluoride during pregnancy. Our measurement of fluoride
exposure in tooth dentin and serial urine samples offers an unprecedented opportunity to test for
neurotoxic effects of early-life exposure to fluoride. The large sample size will let us find out if to
child sex, timing of exposure, or exposure to powdered infant formula impact fluorideâs toxicity.
Major contributions include: 1) quantification of exposure to fluoride during fetal development
and early childhood using dentin; and 2) results that will directly impact decision making
concerning the safety of fluoride exposure during fetal development and early childhood at levels
relevant to the U.S. and Canada. Given our archived resources, we will be able to accomplish
this study efficiently and cost-effectively."

Myotonia congenita (MC) and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HPP) are inherited skeletal muscle ion
channel diseases. Despite initial descriptions of both diseases many years ago, effective and well
tolerated therapy for both disorders has remained elusive. The reason for this is that a detailed
understanding of mechanisms regulating muscle excitability in health and disease is lacking. A better
understanding of mechanisms underlying muscle dysfunction in the non-dystrophic ion channelopathies
is necessary to develop improved therapy for patients.
While it is known that muscle in myotonia congenita is hyperexcitable due to reduction of ClC-1 current,
the mechanisms underlying two motor symptoms suffered by patients remain poorly understood. The
first is transient weakness in recessive forms of myotonia congenita (Becker disease). While the
weakness lessens with continued exercise, it is likely a significant contributor to motor dysfunction.
Weakness appears to be due to loss of muscle excitability, but the mechanism is unknown. The second
symptom is stretch-induced (percussion) myotonia. As muscles must alternately contract and stretch
during movement, stretch-induced myotonia may contribute significantly to stiffness. Currently, nothing
is known about the mechanism triggering stretch-induced myotonia.
We have discovered novel currents that underlie both weakness and stretch-induced myotonia. In Aims
1 and 2 our goal is characterize these currents and to test the efficacy of available blockers to develop
novel therapy for motor dysfunction in myotonia congenita. In Aim 3 we extend this work to study of
motor dysfunction in hyperkalemic periodic paralysis."
10878989,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Music therapy has become a standard palliative care service in many pediatric and adult hospitals. However, a
majority of music therapy research has focused on the use of music to improve psychosocial dimensions of
health, without considering biological dimensions. In addition, few studies have examined dose-response
relationships. Cancer treatment is an inherently stressful experience, and a significant number of young
children and parents (caregivers) experience persistent, interrelated emotional distress and poor quality of life.
Many parents also experience traumatic stress symptoms because of their child's cancer diagnosis and
treatment. Our previously tested Active Music Engagement (AME) intervention uses active music play to
diminish stressful attributes of cancer treatment to help manage emotional/traumatic distress experienced by
young children (ages 3-8) and parents and improve quality of life. A recent AME trial is examining psychosocial
mechanisms of action responsible for change in child/parent outcomes. The current study expands on this
work by examining AME's effects on several biomarkers to povide a more holistic understanding about how
active music interventions work to mitigate cancer-related stress and its potential to improve immune function.
The purposes of this two group, randomized controlled trial are to examine biological mechanisms of effect and
dose-response relationships of AME on child/parent stress during the consolidation phase of Acute
Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) treatment. Specific aims are to: 1) establish whether AME lowers child and
parent cortisol, 2) examine cortisol as a mediator of AME effects on child and parent outcomes, and 3)
examine the dose-response relationship of AME on child and parent cortisol. Child/parent dyads (n=228) will
be stratified (by age, site, ALL risk level) and randomized in blocks of four to AME or attention control. Each
group will receive one 45-minute session during weekly clinic visits for the duration of ALL consolidation (4
weeks standard risk; 8 weeks high risk). Parents will complete measures at baseline and following the last
study session. Child and parent salivary cortisol samples will be taken pre and post-session for the first 4 AME
or attention control sessions. Child blood samples will be reserved from routine blood draws prior to sessions 1
and 4 (all participants) and session 8 (high risk participants). Linear mixed models will be used to estimate
AME's effect on child and parent cortisol. Examining child and parent cortisol as mediators of AME effects on
child and parent outcomes will be performed in an ANCOVA setting, fitting the appropriate mediation models
using MPlus and then testing indirect effects using the percentile bootstrap approach to estimate the indirect
effect. Graphical plots and non-linear repeated measures models will be used to examine the dose-response
relationship of AME on child and parent cortisol. Findings will increase mechanistic understanding of the
effects of active music interventions on multiple biomarkers and understanding of dose-response effects, with
direct implications for the evidence-based use of music to improve health."

The overall goal of the proposed UC San Francisco â UC Berkeley Tuberculosis Research Advancement Center
(UCSF-UCB TRAC) is to accelerate the pace of discoveries that improve our understanding of tuberculosis (TB)
and lead directly to new tools for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of TB. Addressing the complex problems
of the current heavy burden and persistence of the TB epidemic requires partnerships across disciplines;
mobilization of technology for identification, intervention, and prevention; and mentoring of future scientists and
clinicians. The UCSF-UCB TRAC is uniquely positioned to address these challenges for radically new
treatments, better diagnostics and an effective vaccine. UCSF and UCB represent a major hub of NIH-funded
TB research with many labs across the wide spectrum of disciplines, and the UCSF-UCB TRAC will fill a critical
gap in a prominent clinical and basic science research environment. Our proposed UCSF-UCB TRAC will allow
us to, (1) attract and support New Investigators (NI) in the TB field by providing pilot awards, training, longitudinal
mentorship and other key services and resources; and (2) attract and enable non-TB investigators to enter the
field by providing awards, key resources and opportunities for multidisciplinary collaboration that support new
directions in TB research. Further, our Center tightly integrates 4 cores: 1) an Administrative Core to provide
leadership, infrastructure, administrative and communication support, advice and oversight to coordinate all
UCSF-UCB TRAC operations; 2) a Basic Science Core to lower traditional barriers experienced by investigators
to facilitate innovative, multidisciplinary, fundamental TB research through a suite of cutting edge technologies
accessible in BSL-3/ABSL-3 facilities; 3) a Clinical Science Core to augment existing UCSF and UCB resources
to accelerate clinical research by engaging new investigators and reducing the barrier to conducting high-quality,
innovating clinical research; and 4) a Developmental Core to attract and develop scientific leaders in TB research
via a platform of services to support a continuum of ideas to independence in TB research, offering mentoring,
professional development, proposal support, and research funding. The UCSF-UCB TRAC will add value to the
robust research enterprises of UCSF and UC Berkeley by bridging traditional silos between fundamental and
clinical TB and by providing a nucleating factor for coordinated TB research resources and collaboration at the
two campuses and at affiliated international research sites."
10889023,"ABSTRACT
 Inflamed bone fracture poses a significant clinical problem. In the United States, approximately 1.6 million
bone fractures encounter prolonged healing or non-union each year, among which, the major population bearing
with these clinical complications are patients with inflammatory conditions, e.g, elder patients, smoking, diabetic
or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. In these patients, the fracture risk is increased due to the poor bone quality,
highlighting the potential deleterious role of chronic systemic inflammation in fracture repair.
 The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that under inflammatory conditions, NF-ÎºB, the principal
mediator of inflammation, induces RbpjÎº expression through downregulating Dnmt3b and its DNA methylation
activity. We further hypothesize that Dnmt3b GOF or RbpjÎº inhibition restores MPC differentiation and
chondrocyte maturation that are reduced by inflammation during fracture repair. This hypothesis is supported by
our preliminary data wherein we show that Dnmt3b is highly expressed in fracture callus during fracture repair
and Dnmt3b is the major DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) responsive to cytokine in MPCs and chondrocytes.
Relevant to our proposal, we provide evidence that inflammatory signals inhibit Dnmt3b in MPCs and
chondrocytes in an NF-ÎºB-dependent manner. Consistently, mice with Dnmt3b loss-of-function (LOF) in MPCs
and chondrocytes display delayed fracture repair; and Dnmt3b gain-of-function (GOF) in MPCs or chondrocytes
shows protective effect from inflammation in vitro and accelerates fracture repair in mice. Mechanistically, MPC
differentiation defect mediated by inflammation and Dnmt3b LOF coincide with upregulation of RbpjÎº in MPCs
and RbpjÎº inhibition can restore differentiation capacity in vitro.
 In vitro mechanistic studies and in vivo LOF and GOF approaches will be used to modulate IKK2, Dnmt3b
and RbpjÎº expression in MPCs and chondrocytes to dissect its effects during fracture repair process. Three main
Specific Aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1 will delineate the effect of constitutively active NF-ÎºB signaling
(IKK2ca), as the principal molecular driver of inflammation, on Dnmt3b expression and fracture repair. Specific
Aim 2 will establish the effect of Dnmt3b GOF in MPCs and chondrocytes on accelerating fracture repair.
Specific Aim 3 will delineate the mechanism by which Dnmt3b regulates downstream target, RbpjÎº, during
fracture repair. This work will enhance our understanding of mechanisms by which systemic inflammation (via
the NF-ÎºB pathway) affects the fracture healing process through Dnmt3b and identify downstream targets of
Dnmt3b (such as RbpjÎº) as novel candidates for therapeutic intervention."
11039614,"Between 8-12% of people exposed to opioids develop opioid use disorder (OUD). Developing more effective
preventions and treatments for OUD requires a better understanding of genomic and epigenetic mechanisms
that underlie individual vulnerability to distinct stages along the OUD trajectory (e.g., initial use, compulsive
use, relapse). The overall goal of this proposal is to use an outbred rat model (Sprague-Dawley) to identify
novel downstream genes and upstream regulators of gene transcription involved in 3 behavioral phenotypes
associated with distinct stages along the OUD trajectory. By comparing rats that show high versus low levels of
addiction-like behavior at each stage, we will be able to identify changes in gene expression and their
regulation associated specifically with susceptibility to opioid addiction from among the numerous effects of
opioids that are unrelated to addiction. Anhedonia produced during withdrawal from acute morphine (i.e.,
withdrawal-induced anhedonia, WIA) will be used as an addiction phenotype of the earliest phase of OUD, i.e.
prior to voluntary drug consumption. We have previously found that WIA is more strongly associated with a
range of measures of subsequent i.v. morphine self-administration (SA) than these SA measures are with one
another. Economic demand for morphine and reinstatement after extinction will serve as measures of drug
reinforcement efficacy and propensity for relapse, respectively, after extensive morphine SA. To identify
vulnerability-related genomic targets, we will use Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques and
advanced bioinformatic tools to compare transcriptomic and epigenomic differences in rats exhibiting high
versus low levels of WIA (Aim 1), demand (Aim 2) or reinstatement (Aim 3). Our epigenomic assays will map
loci of chromosomal accessibility (using ATAC-seq) and of the stable chromatin mark H3K4me3 (using ChIP-
seq). We will overlay each of these data sets onto RNA-seq data to identify genes showing differential
activation in High- versus Low-Susceptibility rats, as well as upstream regulators of these transcriptional
effects. These assays will focus on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a node within the mesocorticolimbic
system that plays a pivotal role in addiction. We will also overlay epigenomic maps derived from our studies
onto genotyping data derived from larger studies of Heterogeneous Stock (HS) rats manifesting High- versus
Low addiction-related behavioral phenotypes (e.g., drug intake, impulsivity), in other NIDA Animal Genetics
Consortium U01/P50 projects. We hypothesize that these comparisons will yield a set of downstream genes
and upstream regulators associated with individual differences in early vulnerability to addiction-like behavior
and its severity once established. We further hypothesize that our transcriptomic and epigenomic data will
provide a viable roadmap for identifying genetic variants from larger genomic datasets associated with
individual differences in OUD susceptibility. As such, our studies promise to yield novel genomic and molecular
targets for developing more effective, individualized approaches for the prevention and treatment of OUD."
10652993,"Proactive goals of care conversations (GoCCs) conducted in advance of clinical deterioration are a hallmark of
high-quality, patient-centered care. When done well, GoCCs allow healthcare providers to tailor end-of-life care
to patient values and improve key outcomes for patients, caregivers, providers, and the healthcare system.
Given the need for structures and processes to promote GoCCs, the VA National Center for Ethics in Health
Care implemented the Life-Sustaining Treatment Decisions Initiative (LSTDI) at all VA facilities in 2018 to
promote standardized documentation of GoCCs for Veterans at high risk of clinical deterioration. As of early
2020, proactive GoCCs remained vastly underutilized. The onset of the COVID pandemic reinforced the
need for and importance of GoCCs to guide end-of-life care, acting as a catalyst for innovations to
LSTDI implementation. In response to the pandemic, guidelines and lay media instilled a new urgency among
patients and providers to proactively discuss and document GoCCs. Many sites both within and outside of VA
developed innovations to facilitate proactive GoCCs, including outreach to high-risk patients (e.g., those with
dementia), holding GoCCs by telehealth (a new modality for these sensitive discussions), and tasking and
training outpatient providers previously unreached by the LSTDI with conducting GoCCs. [At least 40 VA
facilities have increased outpatient GoCCs in 2021 compared with pre-pandemic rates.]
[Yet it remains unknown how these sites increased and maintained GoCC rates, or whether COVID-catalyzed
LSTDI implementation innovations improved GoCC rates at the expense of GoCC quality or equity. Our
hypothesis is that some facilities prioritized outpatient LSTDI implementation during the pandemic, achieving
sustainable increases in both reach and quality of GoCCs without exacerbating disparities in GoCCs among
Black Veterans. From close evaluations of LSTDI implementation at selected sites, we will identify sustainable
innovations catalyzed by the pandemic that can be spread across VA to improve LSTDI implementation and
delivery of high-quality, equitable, patient-centered end-of-life care, even after the pandemic recedes.]
Our sequential explanatory mixed methods study is designed to [comprehensively assess the long-term
impact] of the COVID pandemic on LSTDI implementation and the frequency, quality, and equity of GoCCs.
We begin with time series analyses to examine how COVID affected LSTDI implementation across VA
facilities, with attention to [sustained] changes in reach to Veterans and adoption by providers (Aim 1). We will
then leverage time series and proportional hazard analyses to assess quality and equity of outpatient GoCCs,
as determined by documentation of National Quality Forum preferred practices in LSTDI notes (Aim 2a), and
length of time from GoCC to death, a marker of proactive advance care planning (Aim 2b). Finally, in Aim 3, we
will interview Veterans, providers, and leaders from [10] sites purposively selected based on Aims 1 and 2
findings to identify best practices to improve [and maintain frequency, quality, and equity of GoCCs, with
special attention to approaches to engage Black Veterans and patients with dementia]. Findings will inform a
playbook to improve quality, equity, and sustainability of LSTDI implementation.
The changes wrought by the pandemic to VA healthcare delivery created an unprecedented opportunity to
identify innovations, challenges, and unintended consequences in implementing the LSTDI, as well as
outcomes of GoCCs on quality and equity of end-of-life care delivered before, during, and after COVID. This
study is designed to leverage the unique circumstance and sense of urgency created by the pandemic and will
produce a usable deliverable: an implementation playbook capturing best practices and innovations catalyzed
by the pandemic. This work is strongly supported by our partners in the National Center for Ethics in Health
Care and the Office of Primary Care to help spread the LSTDI, and it is of central importance to achieving the
VA mandate to conduct GoCCs to improve the quality, equity, and patient-centeredness of end-of-life care."

The Viral Immunity and Vaccination (VIVA) Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) will carry out a
comprehensive systems immunology program to assess the dynamic human immune response to SARS-CoV-
2, seasonal influenza viruses and tetravalent and trivalent dengue vaccines and subsequent infections by those
pathogens. It will generate comprehensive innate, cellular and adaptive immune signatures that correlate with
vaccine outcomes. The VIVA HIPC will leverage recent advances in human immune profiling methods to
characterize the diverse states of the human immune system before and after vaccination against these viral
pathogens of great public health concern using novel immune phenotyping and genomics strategies that
generate data and tools to be used for downstream data analysis and functional investigations. The proposed
studies will use longitudinal biospecimens from established human cohorts of respiratory infections and
vaccinations in the US and Argentina as well as from vaccine trials in the US (provided by the Clinical Core,
Core B). In addition, validation experiments using human tonsils sourced from healthy individuals and exposed
ex vivo to the different vaccine types will be conducted. Three complementary, well-integrated projects will
produce in-depth human immune profiles and signatures of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations and infections (Project
1), seasonal influenza vaccinations and infections (Project 2) as well as dengue vaccine and human challenge
studies (Project 3). Unique in our approach is the use of longitudinal cohorts for in vivo profiling, supported by
ex vivo human tonsillar histoculture (HC) models for infection and vaccination. Our holistic approach will provide
cutting- responses to
vaccinations and infections by the Immune Phenotyping Core (Core C), genomics/transcriptomics, including
scRNAseq, CITEseq and spatial tissue transcriptomics by the Genomics Core (Core D), and experimental
vaccinations in primary human tonsillar histocultures (HC) in Projects 1, 2 and 3. Data mining, bioinformatics
to identify the network
components and infer their interactions and correlations important for vaccine outcomes will be done by the Data
management and Analysis Core (Core E). The VIVA HIPC will make the data, analyses and immune profiles
generated available to the scientific community by coupling our local data infrastructure to ImmPort (directly or
through the HIPC Coordinating Center). This integration will ensure full and timely release of clinical, sample,
and experimental metadata in synchrony with genomic data releases to standard data repositories including
SRA, GEO, and Genbank (Core E). The VIVA team (Drs. Krammer, Garcia-Sastre, Durbin, Gamarnik, van
Bakel and Sebra) led by Dr. Fernandez-Sesma and Dr. Simon includes physicians, physician scientists and
scientists with complementary expertise in viral immunology, viral pathogenesis, vaccinology, genomics,
data analysis and a proven track record of collaboration and excellence."

From a human health perspective, genetic heterogeneity due to accumulation of mutations in normal
tissues increases cancer risk, and is likely an important factor in many degenerative diseases, such as
adult macular degeneration, congestive heart failure, inflammatory & autoimmune disorders,
sarcopenia & muscle weakness, and skeletal & joint degeneration. Somatic mutations can occur due to
DNA damage or replication errors. However, it has been difficult to detect somatic mutations in
individual patients because it has not been possible to reliably compare sequences of the genomes of
single cells. Human colon crypts can be used as a clonal representation of the colon stem cell at the
base of each crypt. Using SNP microarray, we have shown that large-scale human somatic cell-to-cell
differences (deletions, gene conversions, duplications) exist in colon crypts and increase with age. We
have optimized methods for whole genome sequencing without whole genome amplification to >30X
depth using a single colon crypt of 1000 to 2000 cells to study mutations accumulated in both nuclear
and mitochondrial genomes. An increase in single base mutations in both the nuclear and mitochondrial
genomes with age was observed in the whole genome sequencing analysis. Based on power
calculations using these preliminary findings, we propose to expand the study to include a total of 21
individuals distributed among three age groups to statistically validate our findings and examine
potential mechanisms for the age-related DNA damage. In Aim 1, whole sequencing libraries will be
constructed from five single colon crypts and the bulk tissue for >30X coverage of the genome from
each individual human subject over a range of ages from children to elderly. In Aim 2, the whole
genome sequencing data will be examined for point mutations and small indels, and for crypt to
germline and crypt-to-crypt changes in the same individual. In Aim 3, large deletions will be identified
to discern the mechanism of both the DNA breakage and the repair. In Aim 4, DNA sequence motifs at
sites of genetic change will be examined to identify preferred damage sites in the nuclear as well as the
mitochondrial genome. The potential biochemical basis and the molecular repair pathway of these age-
related DNA aberrations will also be explored. These efforts are important for understanding what DNA
sequences are at highest risk for the types of DNA damage or error-prone DNA repair that result in
accumulation of genetic change. This study will lay the foundation for future work to study how
environment and diet may affect the progression of somatic genetic changes over the human lifespan
as well as how polymorphisms may predispose some individuals to more rapid degenerative diseases
or cancer and thus permit consideration of preventive measures. Also, as diagnostic analysis relies
upon progressively fewer somatic cells, this knowledge of somatic cell genetic heterogeneity will
become increasingly important for precision medicine."

At least one quarter of the 18 million persons in the US with intellectual and developmental disabilities engage
in self-injurious behavior (SIB), which can result in injuries, disfigurement, and loss of function (e.g., blindness).
In most cases, SIB is maintained by social reinforcement (e.g., attention). SIB that persists in the absence of
social reinforcement has been referred to as automatically reinforced SIB (ASIB), based on the supposition
that the behavior itself produces some type of biological reinforcement. The current standard of care approach
to treatment for ASIB includes two phases: a Pre-Treatment Assessment (a Competing Stimulus Assessment
to identify stimuli associated with reductions in ASIB), followed by treatment where competing stimuli are
delivered on a noncontingent reinforcement (NCR) schedule. Our NICHD- supported research to date has
identified subtypes of ASIB that vary greatly in terms of their responsiveness to these treatments. Subtypes are
based on results of standardized assessment conditions: Subtype 1 varies inversely with the level of
stimulation across conditions; Subtype 2 is invariant; and Subtype 3 is characterized by self-restraint, a
self-limiting behavior that occurs to avoid ASIB, but also impairs adaptive functioning. Treatments using NCR
with competing stimuli alone are effective in over 82% of cases with Subtype 1, but in only 7% of cases with
Subtype 2 or 3, necessitating restraint or protective equipment to sufficiently reduce ASIB. The identification of
subtypes has revealed the urgent need for more effective interventions for the treatment-resistant subtypes.
Fortunately, our research (R01 HD076653) has also led to several recent discoveries that provide the
conceptual and empirical basis for a new Intensified Approach to treatment targeting the most
treatment-resistant subtypes (Subtype 2 and 3 ASIB). The proposed treatment approach is based on the same
principles as the current Standard of Care Approach (Matching Law and reinforcer competition), but employs
novel methods to more effectively compete with reinforcement maintaining Subtype 2 and 3 ASIB, and to
address self-restraint for Subtype 3. The proposed Intensified Approach to treatment includes three phases: 1)
Pre-Treatment Assessments will identify competing stimuli, tasks, and self-control devices that reduce ASIB; 2)
Intensive Training to strengthen skills needed to fully access available reinforcement, and replace debilitating
self-restraint; and 3) Combination Treatment using NCR to deliver, and differential reinforcement for
engagement with: multiple competing stimuli, competing tasks, and alternative self-control devices (for Subtype
3). Combination Treatment is designed to greatly increase the amount and vary the sources of alternative
reinforcement. Aim 1 is to identify and establish competing stimuli, competing tasks, and self-control devices
(Subtype 3 ASIB). Aim 2 is to employ a randomized crossover design to demonstrate the effectiveness of
Combination Treatment (developed using the Intensified Approach), relative to NCR with competing stimuli
alone (developed using the current Standard of Care Approach) for reducing ASIB and self-restraint."

The Environmental Health Sciences Research Center (EHSRC) will advance and translate research that
addresses environmental health problems across the urban-rural continuum. Rural America faces unique
environmental challenges from exposure to farm chemicals, air and water pollution from livestock and agricultural
production, rural manufacturing, and the green energy economy. The EHSRC is at the forefront of research in
rural environmental health, determining the role of innate immunity and the inflammasome in lung disease; the
role of the microbiome in health and disease; state-of-the-art biomedical imaging with advanced computational
modeling to assess the effect of inhaled toxicants; and applications for distributed sensor networks and data
analytics for exposure monitoring. The Center applies innovations, for example, in advanced -omics
technologies, population-based animal models, and advanced lung imaging, to advance this research. The
EHSRC vision is to be the primary environmental health sciences (EHS) resource for improving the health of
rural residents in the Midwest by stimulating and translating innovative environmental health sciences research.
This is accomplished by enhancing the careers of Center investigators and through our translational research
vision to translate new insights from rural exposures; population health; individual susceptibilities; and pathways
of toxicity, disease, and repair to enhance environmental health literacy, public health practice, regulatory policy,
new clinical treatments, and precision environmental health. Center goals are to: 1) enhance the effectiveness
of environmental health sciences research and extend the focus of research in five Thematic Areas, including
Inflammation and Innate Immunity, Nanoscience, Population Health, Systemic and Redox Toxicology, and Water
Quality; 2) recruit, mentor, and nurture a diverse group of investigators interested in the environmental health
sciences, with an emphasis on recruiting and grooming future leaders in the field; and 3) engage with
communities and other audiences to translate research knowledge toward improving the health and environment
of rural people in the Midwest and the nation. The interdisciplinary research of the EHSRC is organized around
its Thematic Areas and supported by three facilities, the Integrated Health Sciences Facility Core (IHSFC),
Exposure Science Facility (ESF), and Pulmonary Toxicology Facility (PTF). These facilities provide cost-effective
and cutting-edge services and state-of-the-art equipment. An Administrative Core provides transformative
leadership, leverages institutional support, and manages highly effective Pilot Grant and Career Enhancement
Programs that provide resources and mentoring to advance the careers of promising and diverse early-stage
investigators. The Community Engagement Core engages the Centerâs audiences to ensure the relevance of
EHSRC research and, in collaboration with the IHSFC, translates research to environmental public health."

The application addresses the formidable treatment gap for cognitive rehabilitation of spatial neglect
(SN), defined as asymmetric orienting, perception, and responding to left space after right brain
stroke, causing functional disability. Although veterans with SN are half as likely to return home,
have one-third the community mobility, require 3x as much caregiver supervision, and have longer
hospitalizations, increased fall risk and increased rehospitalization compared with similar right brain
stroke survivors, a personalized approach to SN rehabilitation is not available in veteran-specific
systems of care. We discovered that frontal lobe damage and âAimingâ SN both predict optimal
recovery of functional independence after prism adaptation treatment (PAT). These findings argue for
the development of an [objective, biomarker-based process to identify patients who should be
administered PAT. The algorithm will be developed by identifying specific neurobiological features
predictive of PAT treatment response. Thus, we expect this research will deliver a critical missing
element to rehabilitation, eliminating clinician uncertainty about SN diagnosis and appropriateness of
PAT, and allowing a more personalized health care approach to SN rehabilitation. Our team of
researchers at three high-performing VA medical centers, distinguished in cognitive neurology
analysis of brain imaging predictors, and stroke rehabilitation, from both advanced and clinical data,
will develop the first biological parameter that can be used to assign SN rehabilitation. In 180
veterans (120 with SN, 60 without), we will define and validate brain imaging biomarkers that predict
the presence of Aiming SN (Aim 1), a strong predictor of functional recovery after receiving PAT. Our
expectation that disconnection of frontal regions with subcortical and parietal regions will predict
Aiming SN. We will also examine the correlation between the brain imaging biomarkers predicting
Aiming SN and improvements in daily life function after PAT (Aim 2).] Then, we will determine if
adding behavioral predictors to biomarker predictors (Aim 3) accounts for additional variance in the
trajectory of functional recovery. The overall impact of our work will be to establish the utility of a
validated biomarker that routinely identifies veterans with SN after stroke who are the best
candidates for PAT. Armed with a biomarker-based algorithm, we can then carry out a large-scale
PAT clinical trial, and personalized SN care. This care pathway could reduce reliance on specialized
SN assessment, [coordinate VA and community systems providing veteran stroke care,] and improve
stroke care efficiency, to enhance outcomes and quality of life after stroke for thousands of veterans."

The long-term goal of the award applicant is to establish a competitive, independently funded research program
that develops robust materials to address healthcare challenges. This goal will be realized through the execution
of an organized, thorough, and integrated career development plan, effective mentorship, and an engaging and
innovative research project. The proposed research project will investigate phase separation in self-etch
adhesive resins and explore the use of monomers capable of adaptable, dynamic hydrogen bonding to improve
overall adhesive performance. The three aims of this project will address the hypothesis that phase separation
during adhesive polymerization forms weakened domains of the hybrid layer, which must be reinforced to ensure
robust adhesive performance. To this end, the first goal of the research project is to study phase separation in
model self-etch adhesives and to ascertain the resulting composition and morphology of heterogeneous domains
that result during polymerization. The second goal of the research project is to develop a series of methacrylate
monomers decorated with two different hydrogen bonding groups (catechol, and ureido-4[1H]-pyrimidinone â
UPy) and ascertain their performance in adhesive resins and efficacy at rearranging in response to applied
stresses. The career development proposed for Dr. Caroline Szczepanski includes training in relevant
experimental protocols to assess the performance, biocompatibility, and stability of polymeric materials intended
for oral care. Additionally, broad training in skills necessary for the management of an independent career and
funded research laboratory (e.g. grantsmanship, lab management) will be addressed. These goals are
complemented by the choice of mentors and the institutional environment which will all assist in providing the
skills and guidance needed by the applicant to develop a successful research program and succeed as an
independent investigator. The mentor team will consist of Prof. Ana Bedran-Russo (University of Illinois Chicago
â UIC), Prof. Christina Chan (Michigan State University - MSU) and Prof. Marco Bottino (University of Michigan).
Profs. Bedran-Russo and Bottino will provide critical guidance and training in the analysis of material
performance in simulated oral environments (e.g. micro-tensile bond testing), as well as the use of dentin
specimens to assess adhesive efficacy. Since both Profs. Bedran-Russo and Bottino are affiliated with schools
of dental medicine, they will also provide Dr. Szczepanski with opportunities to attend research seminars, meet
fellow researchers, and network within this new field of research. Prof. Chan will provide mentorship particularly
focused on grantsmanship as well as navigating the path towards reappointment and tenure at MSU. In addition
to these mentors, Dr. Szczepanskiâs career development plan includes seminars in the grantsmanship,
responsible conduct of research, and mentorship will be pursued throughout the award period. Together, the

10851671,"Abstract
Concentrations of ultrafine particles (UFP) are elevated near major roadways and highways. Evidence is
strong that living in these areas is associated with substantial respiratory, cardiovascular and other adverse
health outcomes. We have contributed to recent evidence of associations between chronic exposure to UFP
and cardiovascular disease risk. Indeed, in response to these findings, including ours, there is growing use of
in-building air filtration to reduce traffic-related pollution levels in homes and schools near highways, including
market-based responses and city ordinances. There is, however, as yet, no empirical evidence that these
measures improve health. This proposal builds on preliminary studies in which we conducted randomized
crossover trials of in-home air filtration on a smaller scale (N= 20 and 23) and a controlled short term setting
(N=77). Our randomized 2-hour exposure study showed that reducing PM with filtration can reduce blood
pressure. Accordingly, we propose a blinded randomized crossover efficacy trial (N=240 households
consisting of 288 participants) of High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filtration in near-highway homes that
lack mechanical air-handling systems. Households will be randomized to 30 days of either filtration or sham
filtration followed by a 30 washout period with a subsequent 30-day period of the alternative assignment.
Room air filters that are commercially available will be placed in the bedroom and living room of each home.
We will measure UFP and PM2.5 concentrations in 20% of the homes during filtration and sham periods and
assess personal exposure in a subset of participants. We will also assess chemical composition of particulate
air pollution in 10 homes/year for exploratory purposes that could lead to future lines of research. Our primary
health endpoints will be participantsâ hsCRP and peripheral blood pressure, measures we have used in
multiple observational studies of UFP as well as in our pilot filtration intervention studies. Secondary biological
measures that contribute to understanding biological pathways will be IL-6 (inflammation), D-dimer
(coagulation), metabolome, central pressure and arterial stiffness. The primary intention to treat analysis will
compare outcomes between HEPA filtration to sham filtration. We will have 80% power to detect a difference
of 0.6 mg/L in change in hsCRP and a difference in reduction in systolic blood pressure of 3.5 mmHg
compared to participants who receive no filtration. Having participants serve as their own controls in the
within-subject comparisons of intervention effectiveness increases our statistical power and eliminates the
possibility of baseline imbalances in demographic and clinical characteristics. A social science evaluation will
inform final adjustments to our approach at the start and also assess participant acceptance and experience
with the intervention at the end. Our primary innovation is that this will be the first near highway HEPA
intervention trial that is large enough and careful enough to be policy-relevant."
10640108,"Background: Store-and-forward teledermatology is a significant part of Department of Veterans Affairsâ
telehealth portfolio. While considerable evidence supports teledermatologyâs potential to provide timely access
to expert dermatologic care, its effectiveness in achieving clinical outcomes that are equivalent to usual in-
person care has not been as well documented due to the lack of objective outcome measures for many skin
diseases. Clinicians typically document skin diseases using non-standardized qualitative language. Manual
review to extract meaningful outcomes data from relatively unstructured text is typically prohibitive.
Significance/Impact: Natural language processing (NLP) offers a previously unexplored approach to
objectively and systematically identify relevant text in the electronic medical record to gauge patientsâ clinical
responses following either in-person dermatology and asynchronous teledermatology consultation. This
project will leverage NLP to follow clinical courses of important skin conditions in the medical record and to
compare the outcomes and effectiveness of teledermatology relative to usual office-based dermatology
consultation. It will also serve as a test for other outcome measures such as access times that are often
assumed to be proxies for quality of care for Veterans. The results may help influence VA telehealth strategy
and policies to enhance access of patients to high quality skin care and to improve patient safety.
Innovation: This project represents a novel application of NLP methods to understand how key clinicians
document skin conditions and to provide a large-scale, systematic and rigorous assessment of
teledermatologyâs effectiveness in caring for Veterans with a variety of skin diseases. The project will also
result in NLP systems which may be translatable to create practical operational quality management tools for
monitoring the quality of follow-up care of both dermatology and teledermatology patients in VA.
Specific Aims: Aim 1 will survey expert and non-expert clinicians to learn how each group evaluates and
documents clinical change in five common skin diagnostic categories. We will test novel annotation methods,
and identify differences between clinician groups in annotated survey responses. Aim 2 will use our annotated
data sets to train and validate NLP models to extract concepts and relationships for our five diagnostic
categories from actual VA clinical notes. This information will be used to create a document classifier capable
of assigning a clinical change status to follow-up notes. Aim 3 will integrate output from our NLP tools to
assign an overall clinical outcome to dermatology and teledermatology referrals. Other important clinical
events and activities available as structured data will be correlated with NLP outcomes to further interpret their
significance. Commonly used access outcome measures will also be compared as a test of their validity.
Methodology: Aim 1 will survey dermatologists and primary care providers to annotate and compare their
responses. Aims 2 and 3 will create trained and validated NLP tools to assign condition and outcome status to
actual clinical notes. Aim 3 will use our tools to compare clinical outcomes following teledermatology and
dermatology consultation and will will utilize the VA Corporate Data Warehouse to obtain structured data on
other key clinical events and access measures.
Implementation/Next Steps: The NLP models that result from this project may be extendable beyond routine
in-person and teledermatology care to generally track clinical course outcomes related to other forms of
telehealth such as dermatology e-consults and video telehealth. In addition, the models may be adaptable to
create a practical dashboard tool to allow providers and quality management staff to monitor the effectiveness
and quality of teledermatology delivered to Veteran patients."
10795631,"Background: Drug overdose is a leading cause of death, accounting for 70,630 deaths in the United States
(US) in 20193. The majority of drug overdoses involve opioids, and opioid-involved stimulant deaths are rising
with 3 out of every 4 cocaine-related deaths involving opioids and 53% of psychostimulant-related deaths
involving opioids7. Drug overdose mortality among Veterans mirror these trends5,6. In Massachusetts, among
individuals who died of an opioid overdose, 1 in 6 had a non-fatal overdose in the preceding 12 months17.
These non-fatal overdoses serve as a promising target for opioid overdose prevention efforts, especially for
evidence-based treatments such as medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). The increase in stimulant-
involved opioid overdoses also highlights the need to investigate strategies to improve uptake of evidence-
based treatments for stimulant use disorders.
Significance: In March 2019, the VHA Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention released a national
clinical note template, the Suicide Behavior and Overdose Report (SBOR). The SBOR standardizes the
reporting process, enhances the visibility of suicide and overdose events in the medical record, and is intended
to improve clinical care after these events (e.g., by incorporating risk factors for overdose and strategies to
mitigate risk, including referrals for care). However, the SBOR is currently mandated for intentional overdose
and only recommended for unintentional overdose. Moreover, it is unclear the extent to which it is being used
and whether its use improves post-overdose care as intended.
Innovation and Impact: The proposed study will characterize non-fatal opioid-, stimulant-, and combined
opioid and stimulant overdoses among VHA patients and the extent to which they receive recommended post-
overdose care. Given that the SBOR will soon be mandated for all overdoses, and to ensure that VHA is doing
everything it can to prevent overdose mortality among Veterans, it is critical to understand whether the SBOR
is improving post-overdose care as intended and if additional strategies may be needed.
Specific Aims: The proposed study will pursue the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Characterize non-fatal opioid and/or stimulant overdoses within VHA and patient-, prescriber-, and
setting-related factors associated with post-overdose treatment utilization.
Aim 2: Describe utilization of the SBOR among providers of patients with non-fatal opioid and/or stimulant
overdoses and associations between SBOR use, post-overdose treatment utilization, and treatment outcomes.
Aim 3: Identify barriers and facilitators of post-overdose care and ways to improve it via interviews with VHA
patients, patientsâ concerned others, and treatment providers.
Methodology: The Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and MaintenanceâRE-AIMâframework
will guide our study. Aim 1: VHA patients with non-fatal overdoses will be identified using Corporate Data
Warehouse (CDW), Community Care, and Medicare data from Fiscal Years 2014 to 2021 (FY2014-2021).
Regression models will describe patient, prescriber, and setting factors associated with post-overdose care.
Aim 2: Using CDW, Community Care, and Medicare data combined with VA Mortality Data Repository data,
primary analyses will examine whether providersâ SBOR use is associated with patientsâ post-overdose
treatment utilization and reduced mortality using marginal structural Cox mediational models. Aim 3: Up to 60
total interviews will be conducted with VHA patients who experienced a non-fatal overdose, their concerned
others, and VHA providers who documented a non-fatal overdose. Rapid and in-depth qualitative analytic
approaches will be used; the former allows for rapid provision of actionable feedback to operations partners.
Next Steps/Implementation: Our research team has strong operational partnerships and helped develop and
implement the SBOR. Our team will ensure that findings are quickly translated to improve post-overdose care."
10906645,"Summary
Up to 80% of lung transplant recipients who survive beyond five years will develop chronic lung allograft
dysfunction (CLAD), a heterogenous, progressive condition characterized by the gradual and irreversible
functional decline eventually leading to death. Once developed, the majority of CLAD types do not respond
well to currently available therapeutic interventions. Early diagnosis of suspected CLAD is therefore crucial to
efforts aimed at the delaying disease onset and/or progression, which usually proceed via the aggressive
treatment of associated immunological risk factors.
Despite recently revised criteria, the current clinical reliance on spirometry to diagnose suspected CLAD
suffers from several disadvantages: namely, the global nature of the measurements provided by pulmonary
function tests (PFTs), their failure to differentiate between rejection and infection as the cause of functional
decline, frequent inter-observer disagreement in interpreting their results and, finally, their inability to improve
the targeting of transbronchial biopsy. An imaging modality capable of sensitively and accurately detecting
CLAD-onset earlier and with more spatial specificity would provide significant clinical value.
In response to this need, the proposed project will use the sensitive, regional measurements of lung function
which various hyperpolarized xenon-129 MRI techniques are uniquely capable of providing to develop a set of
imaging markers capable of diagnosing suspected CLAD before spirometric measurements reveal a clinically
significant functional decline; ideally, these markers will also enable a distinction to be made between
obstructive and restrictive forms of CLAD before either becomes symptomatic.
The first task of this project will be to use multi-breath HP xenon-129 MR imaging to establish regional specific
ventilation (SV) and alveolar oxygen tension (PAO2) as imaging markers for the early diagnosis of obstructive
CLAD: increased heterogeneity in these sensitive measures of gas replacement dynamics within the
transplanted lung will offer an earlier indication of CLAD-associated functional decline than spirometry. Next,
we will use dissolved-phase HP xenon-129 imaging to quantify the efficiency of alveolar gas exchange and
transport in order to detect the fibrotic and bloodflow impediments to pulmonary function associated with
restrictive CLAD. Finally, we will attempt to radiologically define several novel sub-classifications of CLAD
related to known associated risk factors such as ischemia reperfusion injury, respiratory infection, antibody-
mediated injury and gastroesophageal reflux."

10928078,"ABSTRACT
Bladder cancer (BCa) is predominantly a disease of aging with the risk of developing invasive disease peaking
in the 8th decade of life. Elderly patients have higher rates of co-morbidities and are thus often not suitable
candidates for standard of care surgery and/or chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Moreover, unlike other cancers
such as breast and colon, BCa in the elderly is more aggressive and associated with poorer outcomes. Aging is
also associated with both increased baseline levels of tissue inflammation and major differences in the gut
microbiome. Aging-associated changes in the microbiome and inflammation have been linked to cancer
incidence and progression, and poorer outcomes with immunotherapy and chemotherapy in multiple cancers. In
spite of the numerous studies describing these changes, mechanistic studies attempting to understand how
these changes impact BCa are comparatively absent. To investigate this phenomenon in a translational setting,
we exposed young (8 weeks at start) and older mice (78 weeks at start) to the model BCa carcinogen N-Butyl-
N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN). We found older animals had increased baseline levels of inflammation
and developed larger, more aggressive tumors after 16 weeks of BBN. Older animals also had more inflamed
tumors as we found higher levels of recruited neutrophils and macrophages. Innate immune cells, particularly
neutrophils, have been associated with a pro-tumorigenic phenotype in colon, liver, and other cancers and thus
we proposed altered inflammation may be a cause of the larger tumors. As aging results in major changes in
microbial diversity, we also evaluated 16S sequencing of the fecal microbiome to determine if these animals
underwent similar changes. While the microbiomes were similar at the start of the study, we found major
divergences between the groups over time, with significant differences in Ã-diversity between young or old
animals with cancer. This has led to the hypothesis that gut dysfunction drives neutrophil recruitment to enhance
BCa formation in aged animals. In Specific Aim 1, I will assess gut dysfunction and microbial divergence over
time in young and old animals. In Specific Aim 2, I will use fecal microbiota transplantation to determine if
switching microbiota constituency between young and old animals during tumor formation can affect BCa
tumorigenesis. In Specific Aim 3, I will use pharmacological and genetic inhibition of specific aspects of neutrophil
biology to evaluate the role of neutrophils in BCa development in young and old mice. Completion of these aims
will provide the first murine model for aging related increases in BCa. Moreover, this research sets the stage for
future R01 studies aimed at detailed mechanistic studies understanding the signaling mechanisms that mediate
these observations as well as studies using combination therapy with immunotherapy as a novel treatment for
BCa. Dedicated time to perform these studies will serve as the critical preliminary data to propel the applicant,
Dr. Ben Woolbright, towards an independent career."

 â
This proposal is for renewal of the National Hispanic Science Network (NHSN) Annual Conference grant (R13
DA026647), to support five three day, stand-alone conferences. The NHSN is dedicated to improving health
equity of Hispanics by increasing the amount, quality, and dissemination of interdisciplinary translational
research and fostering the development, advancement, and promotion of future Hispanic scientists and leaders.
The NHSN conference assembles members of the global research community focused on different aspects of
substance use disorder including epidemiology, toxicology, environmental health, intervention science,
psychology, sociology, health policy, and neurobiology as it pertains to Hispanic populations. The NHSN
conference is unique in that it serves as a forum for transdisciplinary scientific discourse spanning from basic
neuroscience to implementation science and policy. The NHSN conference serves as a venue for mentoring,
networking, and professional development of scientists underrepresented in their respective disciplines.
Because many of the sociocultural factors and comorbid conditions relevant to Hispanic communities are shared
with other underrepresented minority (URM) populations, our goal is to expand the scope of the conference (on
alternate years) to include African-American, Asian-American, and Native-American workgroup participation.
The proposed yearly conferences will continue to serve as the unique venue for transdisciplinary and
interprofessional scientific discussions on strategies towards minimizing the impact of substance use disorders
and their comorbidities on health disparities in Hispanics and other URMs. In addition, the conferences will
continue to foster recruitment, retention, development, and advancement of Hispanic scientists to promote future
leaders in substance use disorder research and related areas. The NHSN conference is an opportunity for
trainees of diverse gender, ethnicity, discipline, and geographic location to come together and participate in a
multidisciplinary scientific meeting, establish peer support groups, and develop professional relationships that
provide venues for innovative developments in the field."
11014937,"Background:
The Senior Research Career Scientist Award (SRCS) requires a strong and dedicated
commitment to the VA and to the care of Veterans. This award recognizes individuals who have
made significant contributions to the VA in their research, mentoring and teaching, service
activities, and scholarly productivity. Maintaining the SRCS requires not only a personal and
deep sense of commitment to the VA, but also an acute understanding of the needs of the
Veteran population. With rapidly changing VA national priorities, it is critical that awardees are
aware of these changes, realign their own research goals with those of the VA, and reflect the
latest priorities in their own research studies and professional commitments.
Specific Aims:
The overall goal of this renewal application is to continue to make important and productive
contributions that improve the safety and quality of care provided to Veterans through
leadership and service on VA local and national activities, obtaining independent funding,
maintaining scholarly productivity, and leading mentoring and training activities. The specific
aims are to: 1) mentor junior faculty, fellows, students, and project staff at both the VA and
university settings; 2) become a national expert and leader in evaluating the impact of
community care on Veteransâ health outcomes, as well as the quality and safety of care; and 3)
pursue research to advance the measurement of patient safety and quality, ultimately achieving
scientific distinction and national recognition in this area.
Methods:
To accomplish Aim 1, the applicant will dedicate specific time each week for mentoring and
training purposes. This will include one-to-one sessions as well as group meetings such as the
writing and mentoring group that occurs bi-weekly. Mentoring/training will involve discussions of
long- and short-term career goals, review of proposals, grants, and manuscripts, discussion of
potential service opportunities, and other topics as they arise. For Aim 2, current research on
evaluating Community Care program, with a focus on quality, safety, cost, and access, will
continue with HSR&D funding of a three-year grant. To accomplish Aim 3, the applicant will
continue research through work funded by the VA National Center of Patient Safety and also
HSR&D. Additional training and skills in implementation science, evaluation research, and
advanced statistical methods will be undertaken in order to provide the applicant with new skills
necessary for accomplishing this work in order to achieve scientific distinction and national
recognition.
Expected Results:
Scientifically rigorous and timely evaluation of the impact of VAâs changing national priorities,
including expansion in the use of Community Care, will provide VHA with critical information
needed on the quality and safety of care that Veterans receive in the community. Moreover, the
activities proposed in this SRCS renewal application will significantly contribute to improving the
overall quality of care provided to Veterans, as well as strengthen the personal commitment and
contribution of the applicant to the VA for at least the next seven years."

The goal of this proposal is to identify the role of critical developmental molecules in growth and maintenance
of the postnatal intervertebral disc (IVD, or disc), and how the loss of these molecules with age results in
pathological changes in the disc. The disc is a cartilaginous structure present between each vertebra. The disc
has three components: notochord derived central nucleus pulposus (NP), surrounded by orthogonal layers of
annulus fibrosus (AF), and endplate (EP) adjacent to the growth plate. With age or injury, the disc undergoes
degenerative changes leading to chronic lower back pain (cLBP) affecting almost 80% of the adult US
population. Much remains to be learned about the cellular and molecular basis of disc growth differentiation,
and aging, that has limited development of effective therapies. We will use conditional genetic mouse models,
lineage-tracing, and disc injury models to identify the function(s) of a crucial developmental regulator Brachyury
(Bra) in the disc. Our central hypothesis is that Bra-expression by the NP cells is essential for disc growth and
maintenance, and its loss during aging leads to the pathological changes in the disc. BRA is a T-box
transcription factor and a notochordal marker. Previously, we showed that postnatal NP cells express Bra; but
itâs expression decreases with age. We also found that sonic hedgehog (SHH), an important notochord signal
secreted by NP cells, regulates postnatal disc growth and differentiation, and regulates Bra expression. While
the total number of NP cells decreased with age, the Bra-expressing NP cells also decreased with age and
were replaced by non-Bra-expressing ""chondrocyte-like cells"" (CLCs). The lineage relationship between CLCs
and the Bra-expressing cells they replace is unknown, nor is it known how (or if) the loss of Bra expression
leads to disc aging. Our preliminary data showed that all NP cells are lost in an aged mouse disc. We also
showed that conditional targeting of Shh in adult mouse accelerates disc aging, along with the loss of Bra
expression. We further showed that haploinsufficiency of Bra accelerates disc aging, providing the logical
premise for this new project. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that Bra is a primary transcriptional regulator
downstream of SHH signaling, and regulates growth and maintenance of postnatal disc. Aim 2 will test the
hypothesis that NP cells diverge into two molecularly heterogeneous populations, which differ with respect to
Shh and Bra expression. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that Bra controls the survival of NP cells, and prevents
them from differentiating into ""chondrocyte-like"" cells. We expect that the findings from this study will provide
insights into the role of developmental molecules in the maintenance of postnatal disc during growth and aging,
and will identify avenues for targeting such molecules to reverse the aging process, aiding the development of
therapeutics for the treatment of disc related disorders and LBP."

Intrinsic functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging is a powerful tool to study the organization of
functional networks (FNs) in the human brain. Rich and accumulating evidence demonstrates that FNs
undergo predictable normative development in youth, and that abnormal development is associated with
diverse psychopathology. Recent work based on advances in image analytics has established that FNs are in
fact person-specific. When paired with large-scale neuroimaging datasets, person-specific FNs provide
unprecedented translational opportunities for the development of new diagnostics that could guide
personalized treatments for neuropsychiatric illnesses. However, the translational promise of person-specific
FNs is at present hindered by several obstacles. First, current methods compute personalized FNs at a specific
scale, despite clear evidence that the brain is a multi-scale system with a hierarchical functional organization.
Second, to enforce correspondence across different subjects personalized FNs are typically computed under
certain constraints, which may yield biased results. Third, deep learning has achieved mixed success in
neuroimaging data analysis partially due to the fact that ad-hoc network architecture is typically adopted and
feature learning capability is often deprived by adopting pre-engineered rather than learned features. Fourth, to
correct site effects of neuroimaging measures from multiple datasets of large-scale neuroimaging studies
current methods typically attempt to harmonize data prior to statistical modeling, resulting in loss of valuable
information. Fifth, longitudinal neuroimaging and clinical data are increasingly available, but effective analytic
tools for longitudinal data are scarce. Last but not least, deep learning algorithms have been developed to
analyze fcMRI data but are often released as poorly documented source code, limiting both reproducibility and
adoption by translational researchers. In this application, we build on the success of the prior award period to
address these limitations by developing, validating, and disseminating tools that characterize brain functional
organization at an individual subject level. We will leverage complementary large-scale studies of brain
development to validate our methods and delineate how abnormal development of FNs is associated with
major dimensions of psychopathology in youth, including depression, anxiety, psychosis, and ADHD-spectrum
symptoms. Specifically, we will develop novel methods to 1) accurately identify bias-free personalized FNs with
a multiscale hierarchical organization; 2) robustly predict psychiatric symptom dimensions using personalized
FNs with optimized deep neural network architecture and integrated site-effect correction, and 3) effectively
model longitudinal data of FNs to create predictive models of psychopathology. These tools will be released in
a freely available, containerized software package to ensure frictionless portability across computing platforms
and full reproducibility."

Montana Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (MT PRAMS)
Component A: Core Surveillance
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goal of the Montana Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (MT PRAMS)
is to reduce maternal and infant mortality by collecting information that can be used to inform
maternal and infant health programs, health policies and maternal behaviors.
MT PRAMS collects Montana-specific information on the experiences of mothers prior to,
during, and after pregnancy. MT PRAMS provides important information used by public health
programs and professionals to improve the health of mothers and infants in Montana. Data will
be used to identify populations at risk, risk factors, and inform maternal and child health
programs by monitoring health behaviors and access to care.
MT PRAMS follows a nationally developed method for collecting information from a portion of
the women who give birth in Montana each year. A certain number of mothers are randomly
selected to participate in the survey each month. A paper survey is mailed to each of them. If
they donât respond to three survey mailings and a follow-up letter, a telephone call will be used
to follow-up.
MT PRAMS covers key topics of information to maternal and child health, such as prenatal care,
oral health, medical risk factors, breastfeeding, tobacco use, and many others. MT PRAMS
provides data not available from other sources in Montana. Comprehensive analyses will be
performed of the data, and analytic results will be disseminated to program partners and
stakeholders."

Dr. Brust is an infectious diseases specialist and physician-scientist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. His
multidisciplinary patient-oriented research (POR) program focuses on the interplay of tuberculosis (TB) and
HIV in South Africa. A K24 Award would allow him to expand his POR program and develop a robust
mentoring program in TB, HIV and global health research at Einstein. Worldwide, TB is the most common
cause of death in patients with HIV, and the growing epidemic of drug-resistance threatens decades of gains in
TB prevention and care. With an emerging pipeline of novel and repurposed TB medications, there is an urgent
need for innovative research in TB pharmacology, genomics, and clinical trials to evaluate these drugs.
Similarly, there is a need to train the next generation of scientists in multidisciplinary TB/HIV and global health
POR. Dr. Brust's research program of clinical, epidemiologic, and translational studies is built upon a network
of outstanding collaborators in pharmacology, genomics, microbiology and epidemiology. He has a strong
record of successfully mentoring pre-and post-doctoral trainees from multiple institutions and using his
collaborators to provide mentees with broad technical and professional expertise. Einstein has a rich
environment for training clinical investigators through its medical school, post-doctoral fellowships and multi-
disciplinary centers (CTSA, CFAR, Global Health). Within this highly conducive training environment and with a
multi-institutional and multinational collaborative research team, Dr. Brust can expand his comprehensive
mentoring program at Einstein and internationally. His research program is unique at Einstein and his
mentorship is sought by trainees and junior investigators. His mentorship focuses on the design and execution
of hypothesis-driven research to assist mentees in becoming independent investigators. By allowing him to
decrease his clinical responsibilities, this K24 award will permit him to devote more time to mentorship and to
take on a larger number of mentees. The award will also advance his immediate and long-term career goals to:
1) Increase his knowledge of clinical pharmacology to inform current and future studies of new TB medications;
2) Understand how whole genome sequencing can reveal mechanisms of acquired TB resistance; 3) Expand
clinical trials skills to facilitate the design and implementation of TB/HIV trials for novel drugs; and 4) Enhance
the structure and content of his mentorship of trainees pursuing careers in TB/HIV and global health POR.
Finally, this award will support an innovative sub-study of Dr. Brust's new R01 to further investigate the TB
drug clofazimine: 1) To develop a novel assay to measure intracellular clofazimine concentrations; 2) To
correlate intracellular clofazimine concentrations with the emergence of bedaquiline resistance following a
treatment interruption; and 3) to compare intracellular clofazimine concentrations in alveolar macrophages with
that in PBMCs. A K24 award will provide vital protected time, enabling Dr. Brust to build upon his current
success and giving him the skills to grow as both an investigator and as a mentor."
10668958,"The goal of this grant is to harness a new understanding of vulnerabilities in tumors with mutations in the
hereditary breast cancer genes. We have found that cells deficient in the BRCA-pathway genes, fail to properly
respond to DNA replication perturbations (stress) and consequently replication is not restrained properly and
ssDNA regions (gaps) develop. We find that when gaps are present, BRCA cancer cells are sensitive to therapy
and when gaps are avoided, resistance occurs. Our findings that gaps are fundamental to therapy response is
a paradigm shift in the current framework that proposes that persistent DNA breaks and fork degradation is the
cause of sensitivity. Thus, we propose to employ state-of-the-art experiments to map the molecular determinants
of this BRCA pathway fork restraint function. Moreover, will identify the gap making machinery that is critical for
therapy response and the gap avoidance machinery that is critical to therapy resistance. Lastly, we will re-
examine models of therapy resistance previously attributed to restored DNA repair and fork protection and
determine if gap suppression is instead the fundamental resistance mechanism. Collectively, these proposed
studies will identify how cancer cells succumb to and eventually gain resistance to chemotherapy and provide
valuable insight towards biomarkers predicting resistance and drugs that prevent resistance."
10877670,"While genetics has been demonstrated to represent a major risk factor for the development of type 1 diabetes
(T1D), microbiota dysbiosis has been suggested as an elicitor of a break in immunological tolerance and initiation
of Î²-cell autoimmunity. Probiotic microorganisms may be used to prevent or restore this dysbiosis. We
have previously performed an intervention study using L. johnsonii N6.2 in rodents and found that the
administration of the microorganism reduced the incidence of T1D. Translating our rodent studies towards a
potential method for T1D prevention in humans required a pilot study in healthy individuals. We
conducted a double-blind, randomized clinical trial in 42 healthy individuals with no known risk factors for T1D to
evaluate subject responses to the consumption of L. johnsonii N6.2. The administration of L. johnsonii N6.2 was
well tolerated in adult control subjects, demonstrated systemic impacts on innate and adaptive immune
populations and resulted in a decreased kynurenine/tryptophan ratio. These data provide support for the
safety and feasibility of using L. johnsonii N6.2 in prevention trials in subjects at risk for T1D. The long term
goal of our research is to determine that the administration of L. johnsonii or its constituents will prevent T1D
onset in children. As a step in that direction, the primary goal of this proposal is to test the safety and
tolerability in adults with T1D. As a secondary outcome of this proposal, we hypothesize that the administration
of L. johnsonii N6.2 will promote tolerogenic skewing of the host immune system in the context of T1D and
may preserve Î²-cell function. We will achieve the goals of this proposal by evaluating the safety and tolerability
of L. johnsonii N6.2 in adults with T1D, determining the role of L. johnsonii N6.2 in immune cell activation in
adults with T1D and elucidating the mechanism of systemic signal transduction mediated by bacterial
effector components. After completion of this proposal, we will have determined that the consumption of L.
johnsonii N6.2 is safe for adults with T1D with no adverse effects on disease progression. We further expect to
have gathered evidence on the bacterial effectors of systemic responses in the host. The data obtained in the
proposal will provide a stepping stone for the use of L. johnsonii N6.2 in prevention trials in subjects at risk for
T1D."

1982 and funded by the NIH in 2010. The mission of our Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP)
is to train a diverse and creative cadre of physician-scientists who will become leaders in their chosen
fields of research, seek new knowledge and apply that knowledge to enhance health. Our objectives
are to: bring together the best MD-PhD students and faculty from the UM Baltimore, UM Baltimore
County, UM College Park and the NIH to provide integrated training to MD-PhD students committed
to pursuing research careers; develop and assess novel approaches to dual-degree training designed
to enhance completion rates and decrease time to degrees; recruit and retain underrepresented
minority MD-PhD students; and prepare MD-PhD students to become physician-scientists making
significant, independent contributions using their dual degree training in academia, government,
research institutes and industry consistent with NIHâs emphasis on developing the physician-scientist
workforce.
 Our curriculum consists of very strong preclinical and clinical training, abbreviated graduate
didactic studies, MSTP-specific courses designed to integrate medical and scientific knowledge, and
flexible reentry from graduate school to medical school. MSTP-specific activities include: Molecules to
Medicine journal club; Graduate program orientations; Summer Research Rotations with associated
Symposium; Certificate in Methods to Enhance Research Rigor; Physician Scientist Seminars;
Clinical Case Studies and Longitudinal Clinical Clerkship during graduate school; annual MSTP
Retreat and MD/PhD endowed lecture. Our opportunities for dissertation research are extensive and
are interdisciplinary by design. Thus, our program ensures the MD/PhD students are not merely MD
students with PhD training.
 During the current funding period, our MSTP has transitioned to a new Program Director (PD)
bringing a fresh perspective and new initiatives to the program. The PD, a physician-scientist with
credentials in research, education and patient care, joins an Associate Director (AD) who is an
accomplished scientist with experience running a graduate education program.
 Our success during the last five years can be seen the quality and diversity of our applicant pool
and students, high publication productivity and outstanding residency placements. We plan to build
on this success by increasing the size of our overall program and continuing to develop innovative
training and mentoring strategies."
10615790,"There is a knowledge gap and clinical equipoise as to whether statins should be used in patients at high risk
for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), in particular patients with lobar ICH who are at high risk for recurrent ICH.
While the benefits of statins in reducing major adverse cerebro-cardio-vascular events (MACCE) are well
established, statins have been linked to a slight increase in the incidence of ICH, particularly in lobar ICH
patients who have Apolipoprotein E Îµ2 and/or Îµ4 genotypes, and the presence/number of microbleeds on
gradient-echo MRI. There are no prospective or randomized data on the effects of continuation vs.
discontinuation of statins after ICH regarding the risks of ICH recurrence and incidence of MACCE, or long-
term functional or cognitive outcomes, or quality of life. We propose a multi-center, pragmatic, prospective,
randomized, open-label, Phase III clinical trial with blinded end-point assessment (PROBE) in patients with
lobar ICH taking statins to determine whether continuation or discontinuation of these drugs is the best
strategy. We specifically wish to evaluate the effects of discontinuing vs. continuing statins on the risk of
recurrent symptomatic ICH, and the occurrence of MACCE (symptomatic ischemic stroke, symptomatic
myocardial infarction, newly symptomatic arterial occlusive disease (peripheral, retinal, or carotid),
revascularization procedures for coronary, carotid, or peripheral arterial disease, and vascular death) during 24
months of follow-up in patients presenting with lobar ICH while taking a statin. We will also examine: 1) quality
of life, functional, and cognitive outcomes in patients in whom statins are continued vs. discontinued, by
repeated assessments of the EQ-5D quality of life questionnaire, modified Rankin Scale, and Telephone
Montreal Cognitive Assessment at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months; and 2) whether the presence vs. absence of
APOE Îµ2 and/or Îµ4 genotypes modifies the effects of statins on the risk of recurrent ICH, (i.e. whether APOE
genotype can be used as a biological marker to stratify the risk of ICH recurrence in statins-treated patients).
We hypothesize that: 1) discontinuation of statins in patients with lobar ICH is likely associated with reduced
risk of ICH recurrence; and 2) patients with lobar ICH and APOE Îµ2 and/or Îµ4 genotypes have an increased
risk of recurrent ICH with continuation of statins therapy; and that avoiding statins in this subset of patients with
these biological markers might be helpful to reduce the risk of ICH recurrence.
This proposed study within the NIH StrokeNet will answer an important clinical question relevant to everyday
practice. This study will also provide a unique opportunity to simultaneously address important areas in ICH
research identified by the NINDS PRG and StrokeNet: 1) prevention of ICH recurrence; and 2) biomarkers that
may modify treatment decisions in stroke patients. Successful studies aiming to prevent ICH and its recurrence
would have significant public health and cost-saving implications."
10679013,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Large bone defects caused by trauma, infection, or cancer lead to thousands of amputees and millions of
dollars in costs. Recently, a two-staged surgical regimen, Masqueletâs Induced Membrane Technique (MIMT),
has presented a revolutionary way to reconstruct critical-sized defects that is more ideal than the current
standards and could serve a wider patient population. More importantly, it presents a unique opportunity to
discover new bone regeneration biology which could be applied to other bone formation situations (i.e. non-
union, fusions) and possibly other tissues. The key feature of MIMT is an autologous foreign-body membrane
that forms around an implanted bone cement spacer. Weeks to months later during a second surgery, the spacer
is removed and the membrane compartment is filled with morselized bone graft. The technique can heal defects
as large as 25 cm, more than triple the traditional maximum volume treatable via grafting without the membrane.
 However, MIMTâs regeneration mechanisms are completely unknown. All that is certain is that the
membrane is necessary. Its critical functions have not yet been defined, so there is no evidence to improve its
clinical application or harness the biological principles for other tissue regeneration scenarios. A critical barrier
to investigating MIMTâs mechanisms is that it has only been thoroughly established in rats and larger animals.
The number of genetic tools and reagents available for these species are far fewer than those available for
mice. Thus, establishing a mouse-based MIMT model would be very powerful and allow much more in depth
study and manipulation. To date, only one study has used a mouse for MIMT, but the second stage was not
attempted and the first stage study design did not mirror well what has been done in other species.
 The goals of this proposal are to establish a mouse-based MIMT model, compare/contrast this model with what
is known in other species, and use tools only available in mice to answer some fundamental MIMT questions. We
hypothesize that a mouse model is feasible and that host cells, specifically osteoblasts, are mainly
responsible for new bone generation. To test this hypothesis, we will first compare/contrast membrane
formation and bone regeneration dynamics in normal C57BL/6J mice with what is already known from other
species â most specifically rats. After establishing that a mouse MIMT model is feasible, we will use transgenic
C57BL/6J mice to determine the contributions of host/graft cells to regeneration.
 Information gained from these experiments will be combined to target specific cells/genes/pathways in
host/graft mouse tissues in a future R01."
11087905,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chronic, immune activation is one of the major hallmarks of HIV in the modern era, despite the effectiveness of
antiretroviral therapy (ART) in suppressing viral replication. This chronic immune activation is largely mediated
by myeloid-lineage cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and microglia. This demonstrates a critical need
to develop new anti-inflammatory strategies that are effective in inhibiting myeloid activation in the context of
chronic HIV infection and treatment. Cannabinoids, particularly the phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) is
among the most promising new anti-inflammatory drug. However, the impact of CBD on HIV/SIV associated
inflammation is not clear because there have been no studies assessing the anti-inflammatory properties of
cannabidiol (CBD) in the SIV/macaque model of HIV. There is a pressing need to better counteract HIV-
associated inflammation in the ART era. Given the gap in our knowledge regarding the immunomodulatory
effects of cannabinoids, we propose studies on CBD administration in a virally suppressed rhesus macaque
model (ART-SIV). Resident tissue macrophages express functional CB1, CB2, and GPR55, though there is
variable expression among the organs. Our data show that stimulating these receptors inhibits endogenous
and LPS-induced pro-inflammatory and anti-viral genes, while increasing potent anti-inflammatory cytokines.
We determined that these cytokines were a source of chronic inflammation in the periphery and CNS in our
SIV-ART model. Thus, we propose to 1) evaluate the impact of CBD on myeloid immune activation, 2)
determine the effect of CBD on myeloid antiviral signatures, and 3) define the impact of CBD on the monocytic
and microglial neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective transcriptome. We anticipate our work will provide
insight into the mechanisms by which CBD exerts anti-inflammatory properties, both peripherally and in the
brain. Additionally, our findings will fill a critical gap in knowledge regarding the inflammatory mechanisms
underlying CNS dysfunction in the current ART era."
10760278,"A Novel Waveguide to Enable MAS-DNP-NMR in Standard-bore High-field Magnets
Abstract
The critical importance of solid-state NMR (ssNMR) was recently demonstrated by, after nearly two decades of
intense efforts, yielding the first atomic-resolution structures of the A?40 and A?42 amyloid fibrils that play a crucial
role in Alzheimerâs Disease (AD). Key to that structure determination was a technique denoted as dynamic nu-
clear polarization (DNP) with magic angle spinning (MAS). While Cryo EM, scanning tunneling electron micros-
copy (STEM) and other methods provided useful information, recent advances in MAS-NMR methods provided
essential restraints and additional crucial information. Hence, developing transformational advances for ssNMR
is crucial for both structural biology and biomedical research in general, for progress in curing Alzheimerâs Dis-
ease and cancer, and for providing regio-specific drug binding information enabling detailing of the mechanism
of action for effective drugs.
MAS-DNP systems thus far have all required specialized wide-bore (WB) magnets largely because known de-
signs of waveguides compatible with THz transmission and the various relevant issues cannot be made small
enough to work in probes for use in standard-bore (SB, also called narrow-bore, NB) magnets. The specialized
WB magnets and the required corrugated THz waveguides constitute a large portion of the high cost for MAS-
DNP, which has put it out of reach to all but a few premiere laboratories. The Phase-I of this effort demonstrated
what we believe can fairly be described as the most significant advance in waveguides for the 40-1500 GHz
range in half a century â since the invention of corrugated waveguides. Their attenuation is two orders of mag-
nitude below that of prior small waveguides at 400 GHz and comparable to that of the very expensive corrugated
waveguides where the diameter is tightly constrained. Manufacturing costs are expected to be well over an order
of magnitude below those of corrugated waveguides, and they can readily be made at diameters small enough
to make MAS-DNP probes practical in existing NB high-field magnets.
This proposed Phase II effort continues the development of our revolutionary broad-band Laminate-Lined Wave-
Guides (LLWGs) and tapered transitions, for use over the 40-1500 GHz range, as needed for NMR at 1.5-55 T.
It is expected that this advance, in combination with several other technological advances being pursued in other
projects, will enable DNP to be added to existing ssNMR high-field systems without the requirement of either a
specialized magnet or a gyrotron. This Phase-II effort further proposes to demonstrate a 500 MHz NB HXY MAS-
DNP probe operating below 50 K utilizing LLWGs. The LLWG developments will also have major applications in
ultra-broadband 6G communications equipment, next-gen satellite communications, astrophysics, and THz med-ical imaging methods."

A patientâs genetic variant must be contextualized against a population-based reference and detailed phenotype
to assess its pathogenicity and impact on prognosis, based on the care trajectories and outcomes of other
patients with the variant, or similar variants of a particular gene. However, CTSA researchers do not have ready
access to a definitive and representative reference dataset linking the genome to diagnosis, clinical progression,
therapeutic response, and precision-adjusted laboratory reference ranges with the appropriate consents to
recontact patients if needed. In preliminary work, three of the leading childrenâs hospitals in the CTSA program
formed the Genomics Research and Innovation Network (GRIN) leveraging a combined, ethnically diverse
population with unparalleled representation across the pediatric disease spectrum. GRIN sites broadly consent
patients into compatible biobanking protocols. The next logical step is a truly federated CTSA-wide biobanking
initiative, with the informatics supporting a Genomics Information Commons (GIC). With phenotype data
produced as a byproduct of care, we develop the GIC technology, regulatory, and policy backbone, recognizing
both heterogeneity of IT systems across CTSA hospitals and local control imperatives for a successful federated
network. First, adhering to well-established common data models, each site exposes data to investigators across
the secure PIC-SURE meta application programming interface (API), fostering incorporation of multiple
heterogeneous clinical, omics, and environmental datasets. We demonstrate the self-scaling nature of the GIC
as two additional CTSAs join in a modular fashion. Second, we develop two portals for researchers: (A) Prep-to-
research portal. Investigators can execute genotype, phenotype, or combined genotype/phenotype queries, and
receive aggregate results in real time; and (B) Study portal. With proper approvals, patient-level data are readily
transferred to a cloud-hosted environment with data science tools (Jupyter Notebooks, R Studio), SMART on
FHIR apps and resources, and API access to external data sources (e.g., gnomAD, NHANES). Third, we develop
a GIC toolkit with policies for broadly consented biobank enrollment, investigator access, material transfer, and
collaboration to enable new sites to participate and/or self-organize into collaboration networks. Finally, we
leverage the GIC to build, and make publicly available, a knowledge resource of genetically-adjusted, precision
laboratory reference ranges across demographically diverse populations."

 future research partnerships to establish the FDL-RRI as a self-sustaining research institute serving the
 Bemidji and Great Plains areas and facilitating health research according to tribally identified priorities."
10832960,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Aedes aegypti females have evolved efficient metabolic pathways for managing the high ammonia
concentrations that are released during a blood meal's digestion. Carbon (C) atoms from glucose are required
for clearance of ammonia and excess nitrogen (N) disposal through the interplay of multiple pathways,
including glycolysis, and ammonia fixation, assimilation and excretion pathways. What remains unknown is
how these intersecting metabolic pathways are regulated. The long-term goal is to identify the biochemical and
molecular bases underlying the regulation of N and C metabolism in Ae. aegypti, so that novel metabolism-
based strategies for mosquito control can be developed as a way to improve public health and quality of life.
The overall objective for this application is to identify the mechanisms involved in the regulation of polyamines
and glucose/ammonia metabolism. The central hypothesis is that the proper disposition of N waste is
controlled by uric acid and polyamine fluxes, and by proteins involved in the last step of glycolysis. The
rationale for the proposed research is that the identification of regulatory mechanisms will provide new
opportunities for the subsequent identification of targets for the design of innovative strategies to mosquito
control. Guided by strong preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims:
1) Determine the metabolic flux of polyamines and the mechanisms of its regulation in blood-fed mosquitoes;
2) Identify mechanisms of regulation of both glucose and ammonia metabolism in mosquitoes. Under the first
aim, stable isotopically labeled compounds and advanced LC/MS methods, western blots, qRT-PCR, chemical
inhibitors and reverse genetics techniques will be used. In the second aim, standard techniques for gene
cloning, protein purification, kinetic characterization, crystallization and structure determination will be
performed. Further, immunoprecipitation, inmunofluorence, RNA interference, and metabolomics analysis will
be performed. This approach is innovative because it combines classical and state-of-the-art techniques (i) to
monitor metabolite flux at atomic level without sample derivatization and (ii) to identify regulatory mechanisms
of polyamine, glucose/ammonia metabolism at different levels including transcriptional and post-translational
levels. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to fill gaps in current understanding of how
female mosquitoes maintain N and C metabolism and regulate the proper disposition of N waste upon a blood
meal without which ammonia levels could reach lethal concentrations. Thus, these results are expected to
uncover mosquito-specific regulatory mechanisms under high demands of ammonia detoxification. As such, a
much-improved fundamental understanding of the biochemical and molecular bases underlying the N and C
metabolism in mosquitoes can be anticipated. It is also expected that what can be learned in Ae. aegypti
mosquitoes through traditional and advanced technologies will be broadly applicable to identify regulatory
mechanisms in other arthropod vectors of diseases, as well as in other biological systems."

The landscape of aging and technology has changed dramatically. Uptake of technology is increasing among
aging adults; more researchers are focusing on this topic (many of whom are CREATE progeny); technology is
increasingly being considered as a solution for the support needs of aging adults; and more technology products
are marketed to seniors. These trends underscore the continued significance of the Center for Research and
Education on Aging and Technology Enhancement (CREATE). Deployment of technology in healthcare and
day-to-day activities is increasing and advances in technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly
aimed at supporting older adults. Yet, aging adults are often ignored in design, and robust research evaluating
the usability, safety, and efficacy of these systems with older adults is limited. Even among older technology
adopters, rapid changes in technology pose challenges in terms of the constant need for adaptation and
continual learning. Further, there remains a lag in uptake among many older adult sub-groups, including ethnic
minorities, older cohorts, those of lower socio-economic status, those living in a rural location, or with a cognitive
impairment such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's Disease/Alzheimer's Disease Related
Dementias (AD/ADRD). This application is a request for continued support for CREATE, an established
multidisciplinary, cohesive, highly productive, and innovative Center that focuses on aging adults and technology
interactions. CREATEâs goal is to ensure that older adults are able to use and realize the benefits of technology.
CREATE V has a new vision, expanded research program and teams, and target populations, such as those
with MCI, expanded technical expertise, and access to an array of resources, community and clinical partners.
Given that age is a significant risk factor for cognitive impairments such as MCI and AD/ADRD, and the criticality
of cognition to everyday functioning, a thrust of our planned research is on using emerging technologies to help
maintain cognitive health and provide support for those with cognitive impairments. Our Research Program
includes three highly integrated cross-site projects focused on: 1) enhancing cognitive health and cognitive and
social engagement and preventing cognitive impairment; 2) providing support for adults with MCI and using
innovative techniques to assess further cognitive decline such as conversion to AD/ADRD; and 3) providing
cognitive support for health-management activities for those with and without cognitive impairments. Our cross-
site approach allows us to examine heterogeneity in response to our promising interventions. Our Program will
also include an expanded Pilot Research Program to support new research and investigators. CREATE will
involve three main sites: Weill Cornell Medicine, Florida State U. and the U. of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. J.
Sharit will remain as a Co-Leader (U. of Miami). We will also draw on faculty support from other campuses and

10792651,"Circadian misalignment has deleterious effects on metabolism, and contributes to the obesity and diabetes epidemics in the United States. REV-ERB nuclear receptors link the circadian clock and metabolism, and the present proposal combines tissue-specific, genome-wide analysis of cistromes, transcriptomes, and the epigenome in novel mouse genetic models with sophisticated metabolic phenotyping to understand the physiological role of REV-ERBa and b in the generation and systemic coordination of central and hepatic circadian rhythms and metabolism. Specific Aim 1 is to determine the cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous roles of hepatic REV-ERBa and b in liver circadian rhythms and metabolism. We hypothesize that REV-ERBs have cell-autonomous as well as non-cell autonomous functions in hepatocytes. Preliminary characterization of adult mice after hepatocyte REV-ERB double knockout (HepDKO) has demonstrated the cell-autonomous role of REV-ERBs in liver circadian rhythms and also revealed genes that do not lose circadian rhythmicity upon REV-ERB deletion. The underlying mechanisms and specialized metabolic functions will be determined using integrative functional genomics, proteomics, and metabolic phenotyping. Specific Aim 2 is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which hepatocyte REV-ERBs control circadian rhythms in non-hepatocytic liver cells. In addition to hierarchical (cell-autonomous and non-cell autonomous) regulation of peripheral clocks, we hypothesize that there is communication between peripheral clocks in difference cell types with an organ. Preliminary data demonstrate that hepatocyte REV-ERBs control circadian rhythms in non-hepatocytes. The scope and underlying mechanisms will be determined using integrative genomics and metabolomics. In Specific Aim 3 we will determine the role of hypothalamic REV-ERBs in the regulation of circadian behavior and metabolism. We hypothesize that hypothalamic REV-ERBs centrally control circadian
behavior as well as peripheral metabolism, and this is borne out by preliminary analysis of mice with deletion of REV-ERBs in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) as well as other mice with REV-ERB deletion in non-SCN neurons. Cistromic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic analysis will be used to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms. We will also utilize novel mouse models to test the desyncrony hypothesis of metabolic stress resulting from lack of coordination between biological clocks and environmental zeitgeberes. Together, the studies will lead to a more fundamental understanding of the links between circadian rhythm and metabolism that underlie
the mechanism by which circadian misalignment exacerbates metabolic dysfunction, obesity, and diabetes."
10845458,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating worldwide impact on health and economy. There is still
no effective treatment, and the full extent of COVID-19 pathogenesis remains unclear. In particular,
mechanisms for SARS-CoV-2 evasion of host immune surveillance remain poorly understood. I am interested
in exploring both SARS-CoV-2 viral factors that block cellular translation and their roles in viral immune
evasion. I have discovered that SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 14 (NSP14) inhibits host translation and
subsequently suppresses the innate immune response. Furthermore, my data suggest that the guanine-N7-
methytransferase (N7-MTase) activity of NSP14 is required to inhibit translation, which catalyzes N7-
methylguanosine (m7G) modification at 5â cap guanosine. However, how m7G modification restricts cellular
translation is unclear. Moreover, our data also showed that NSP14 inhibits the expression of MHC-I molecules
on the cell surface and this also depends on its N7-MTase activity. However, whether NSP14 dampens MHC-I
antigen presentation and cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses requires further study. I hypothesize that NSP14
induces RNA m7G modification in SARS-CoV-2 infection and that shuts down cellular translation. I further
hypothesize that such activity restricts the MHC-I antigen presentation pathway to escape T cell responses.
The central objectives in this proposal are to define the molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 NSP14
inhibits cellular translation and enhance our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 escapes T cell-mediated
immunity. In Aim 1, I will determine the role of RNA m7G modification in translation inhibition in SARS-CoV-2
infection. In Aim 2, I will define how NSP14 restricts MHC-I antigen presentation and T cell responses. These
two aims will address how SARS-CoV-2 infection can affect T cell-mediated immunity. I expect that our
findings will uncover new strategies to develop new antiviral therapeutics for COVID-19 and help gain new
insights into understanding the biology of COVID-19 pathogenesis.
 My career goal is to become an independent investigator studying virus-host interaction of infectious
diseases, with a special focus on translational regulation and viral immune evasion. The proposed K22 grant
will provide me with advanced training and skills to build specific expertise necessary to execute the proposed
project and become independent in this field, including expertise in: 1. Immunology and Virology, 2. post-
transcriptional modification and translational regulation research, and 3. skills necessary to head an
independent research laboratory. To achieve these goals, I have assembled a Professional/Scientific Advisory
Committee consisting of experts in SARS-CoV-2 Virology, Immunobiology, RNA Biology, and Bioinformatics."

More than 15% of U.S. adults with type 2 diabetes have poorly controlled blood sugar, here defined as a
glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 9.0% or higher. These adults have an elevated health risk of a variety of
outcomes, including amputation and mortality from cardiovascular disease and from all causes. Nutrition-
focused interventions can be effective for improving glycemic control, reducing anti-hyperglycemic
medications, and reducing body weight, all of which are critical outcomes for adults with type 2 diabetes.
However, typical nutrition-focused interventions can be burdensome, often requiring complex instructions and
a complete overhaul of oneâs diet. Additionally, adults with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes are more likely to
have low literacy levels, which can be a barrier for adherence to complex interventions. Therefore, an effective
intervention for adults with poorly controlled diabetes who may have lower health literacy levels is necessary to
reduce both HbA1c levels and anti-hyperglycemic medications. Carbohydrate intake has the strongest impact
on post-prandial glycemia of any dietary factor, and a very low-carbohydrate dietâdue to its ability to improve
glycemic controlâis now recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) for the treatment of type
2 diabetes. We hypothesize that some of the benefits of a very low-carbohydrate diet may be available to
individuals who change only their breakfasts to be very low-carbohydrate, rather than modifying their entire
diet. Thus, we propose an acceptability, feasibility, preliminary effectiveness trial of a 4-month, online, small-
steps, low-literacy, very low-carbohydrate breakfast-focused program in 120 adults with poorly controlled type
2 diabetes. We will measure acceptability and feasibility, plus critical efficacy outcomes, such as changes in
HbA1c, anti-hyperglycemic medications, glycemic variability, body weight, blood pressure, and lipids. We will
also test whether factors such as sex, health literacy level, and baseline insulin resistance significantly
moderate the impact of the intervention on change in HbA1c and change in anti-hyperglycemic medications.
These moderation analyses will contribute to a nascent research approach for personalized nutrition, which
responds to Objective 2-5 of the NIHâs May 2020 Strategic Plan for NIH Nutrition Research. This submission is
in response to PAS-20-160, Small R01s for Clinical Trials Targeting Diseases within the Mission of NIDDK,
which does not require preliminary data. If results are promising, our goal is to conduct a follow-up, powered,
longer randomized trial of this approach. As the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and the understanding of
personalized interventions continue to increase, there is a critical need to provide additional effective options
for population-level type 2 diabetes treatment strategies, especially for adults with poorly controlled type 2
diabetes."

The OâNeal Comprehensive Cancer Center (OâNeal) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham is the only NCI-
Designated Cancer Center in a four-state region including Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas.
OâNealâs catchment area is the State of Alabama, the state with the 8th highest cancer mortality in the country
and a state with significant racial disparities in cancer incidence and mortality. More than half of the population
is medically underserved, and 16 of the 67 Alabama counties are rural (RUCC 7-9). OâNeal (originally the UAB
Comprehensive Cancer Center) was one of the first eight cancer centers designated by the NCI nearly five
decades ago. OâNealâs vision is Life without cancer. Our mission is to advance our understanding of cancer to
improve prevention, detection, treatment, and survivorship for all people. A matrix Cancer Center, OâNeal has
187 members across 7 UAB Schools and 28 Departments. OâNeal members are supported by $22M of direct
cost funding from the NCI and $59M in total direct cost cancer-relevant funding. Their research productivity led
to 2,390 publications in the current CCSG cycle. OâNeal members are organized into 4 Research Programs:
Cancer Biology and Immunology (CBI), Experimental Therapeutics (ET), Neuro-Oncology (NO), and Cancer
Control and Population Science (CCPS). Program research is supported by 12 Shared Resources and is
connected to 15 Disease Working Groups (DWGs) focused on translational clinical research and 8 Cancer
Management Teams (CMTs) of the OâNeal Cancer Service Line (CSL) focused on multi-disciplinary cancer care.
Programmatic Research is focused on seven cancers identified by the Office of Community Outreach and
Engagement (COE) as being significant burdens to our catchment area communities. These include breast,
colon, prostate, brain, lung, and cervical cancers, as well as multiple myeloma. COE provides cancer prevention,
screening, and care education in most Alabama counties with a focus on the 26 counties with the greatest cancer
burdens. During the current CCSG cycle, OâNeal members made significant contributions to our understanding
of cancer that impacted treatment, including new approaches for treating brain cancers. In addition,
improvements in OâNeal clinical trials processes and support lead to a 14% increase in accruals to therapeutic
trials in 2020 over 2019 despite COVID-19, and a projected 21% increase in 2021. In addition, there was a 29%
increase in NCI funding including two newly awarded NCI P01s, a $30M naming gift from OâNeal Industries, and
initiation of a $300M project to build a new free-standing cancer hospital on the UAB Campus. Completion of the
2021-2026 OâNeal Strategic Plan revealed areas of basic, translational, and clinical excellence, including
metabolism and obesity in cancer, cancer imaging, cancer immunology, cancer survivorship and increases in
cancer care access to the underserved. This sets the stage for impactful science in the next CCSG cycle that
will further diminish the cancer burdens and disparities in the State of Alabama."
10624278,"The overall goal of our tuberculosis (TB) Aftermath study is to identify, implement and measure feasible case finding strategies and identify key populations to screen among treated TB patients in India. People treated for TB have high incidence of recurrent disease. A recent analysis of the TB treatment cascade in Indian public-sector hospitals estimated that under 40% of cases were TB free one year following treatment completion and as much as 13% of reported TB per year in India is recurrent TB. Furthermore, India is home to one-third of the worldâs estimated three million undetected TB cases. Thus, active case finding (ACF) approaches targeting recently treated TB cases may be an effective strategy to reduce the global burden of TB. The Indian National TB Control Programs (RNTCP) new strategic plan for TB elimination strongly recommends developing and implementing a scalable surveillance system for recurrent TB. The World Health Organizationâs Systematic Screening for Active TB guidelines suggest that screening for recurrent TB in treated TB patients is a âconditional recommendationâ; conditional only because there is a lack of evidence. TB Aftermath will compare effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and feasibility of two ACF strategies that are presently being considered by the RNTCP for detecting recurrent TB and provide evidence needed to implement and scale the preferred intervention. In Aim 1, we will conduct a randomized trial to measure the comparative effectiveness of two potentially implementable strategies that are presently being considered by the RNTCP for detecting recurrent TB in India: Household ACF (HHACF) vs. ACF by periodic telephonic interviews (TACF) followed by HH screen for HHs reporting any symptomatic members among treated TB patients and their HH contacts. In Aim 2, we will use the RE-AIM framework to understand barriers and facilitators to implementation of the two interventions and identify sub-populations that are best reached by the interventions and sub- populations who may benefit the most from the interventions. We will enhance the RE-AIM approach, by exploring the acceptability of the strategies in depth across three key stakeholder groups (TB patients, HH members, and health care personnel) to optimize implementation. In Aim 3, we will model the impact and cost- effectiveness of the ACF interventions evaluated in the trial, and of potential alternative strategies for the targeting and timing of those interventions. We will use data from the trial to model and compare potential strategies for ACF in terms of expected diagnostic yield, cost effectiveness, and impact on TB control in India. TB Aftermath will answer key questions in a population that is often ignored by the TB community once treatment is complete, despite being at considerable risk for recurrent TB disease. We will provide evidence for an effective and scalable strategy targeting HHs of treated TB cases, a high priority of the RNTCP. Our high TB burden setting, strong multidisciplinary team, communication with the RNTCP and state TB program, and proven research infrastructure ensures successful implementation of TB Aftermath."

10748277,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Ciliopathies are a collection of diseases that feature genetic mutations that impair primary cilia morphology or
function and are characterized by symptoms that include developmental disorders, obesity, cognitive and
behavioral deficits in humans. Primary cilia are immotile organelles that protrude off neuronal soma often
adjacent to the nuclear compartment. A growing body of evidence indicates that extracellular stimuli (i.e.,
neuromodulators) transmits specialized signaling through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) located on
neuronal primary cilia to influence transcriptional changes and neuronal activity. Thus, determining how to
specifically target neuronal ciliary GPCRs, will lead to novel therapeutic approaches for neurological and
neuropsychiatric diseases. This proposal will focus on identifying selective ciliary targeting mechanics employed
by neural GÎ±i-coupled GPCRs and the impact of ciliary GPCR signaling on gene transcription.
We found that in brain sections, neural GÎ±i-coupled GPCRs, such as the mu opioid receptor, are expressed in
neuronal primary cilia of some neuronal populations but not others suggesting cell and/or receptor-selective
ciliary targeting machinery. In Specific Aim 1, we dissect whether ciliary targeting mechanics are cell-specific
and/or receptor-selective in three distinct cell types. In Specific Aim 2, we employ Proteomics-based approaches
to identify novel GPCR-associated proteins involved in ciliary targeting of GÎ±i-coupled GPCRs in cells and brain
tissue. In Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the contribution of ciliary GÎ±i-coupled GPCR cyclic-AMP signaling to
neuronal transcription. Collectively, this proposal will attempt to discern the mechanisms underlying ciliary
targeting of neuronal GPCRs and the neuromodulatory function of ciliary GPCRs."
10834219,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Prediabetes is a significant public health problem affecting 88 million U.S. adults and increases the risk of
developing diabetes with a 5-year risk of up to 50%. The NIDDK has prioritized examining behavioral approaches
to preventing type 2 diabetes. This application seeks to address this priority by developing a prediabetes digital
activation tool to increase patient activation, which is a key driver of positive health outcomes. Patient activation
encourages empowering patients to be knowledgeable and activated, and a collaborative partner in managing
his or her health. However, in clinical practice, primary care clinicians (PCP) often do not have the time or training
to use objective tools to assess their patientâs activation, which may lead them to making recommendations that
may not get followed or not making any recommendations at all. This barrier likely contributes to the low rates of
referral and participation in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a yearlong lifestyle program shown to
decrease oneâs risk of developing diabetes.
Our overarching goal is to increase the percentage of patients engaging in diabetes prevention activities to
reduce the incidence of diabetes. To address this need, we propose the following interrelated Specific Aims: 1)
To develop a prediabetes digital patient activation tool (DPAT) that evaluates a patientâs activation level,
generates for the clinician a visit goal related to prediabetes, questions to guide the visit toward that goal, and
a list of resources that support moving the patient from a lower to higher stage of activation, and 2) To conduct
a conduct a pilot group-randomized controlled trial of DPAT vs. usual care to assess the primary outcome of
increased patient activation, followed by interviews of a subset of participants and PCPs to evaluate
acceptability and feasibility of DPAT. The target population includes adults with prediabetes and BMI â¥25kg/m2
who have an electronic health record patient portal account.
We hypothesize that patients who use this tool will have an increase in activation levels, report greater
satisfaction level and experience, and ultimately, be more likely to be enroll and participate in the DPP compared
to participants in the usual care group. Data from this pilot study would provide preliminary data to test the

11032948,"Ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) is the most common form of phycotoxin-borne seafood illness across the globe,
affecting tens of thousands of people annually. CFP is caused by the consumption of seafood (primarily reef
fish) contaminated with ciguatoxins. Gambiertoxins, precursors of ciguatoxins produced by the (sub)tropical
benthic dinoflagellate genus Gambierdiscus, enter reef food webs when herbivores and detritivores consume
Gambierdiscus directly or indirectly by grazing on macroalgae. These precursor molecules are transferred to
higher trophic levels by bioaccumulation, bioconversion and biomagnification until they reach predatory finfish
species that are targeted in many commercial and recreational fisheries. When people subsequently consume
the contaminated fish, they are exposed to the toxins, thereby experiencing CFP. Historically, CFP outbreaks
have been linked with warm water temperatures and coral reef impacts, both of which are expected to increase
in the setting of climate change. Consequently, CFP is predicted to increase on geographic and temporal scales.
For example, although CFP is endemic to the Caribbean, the Florida Keys, and South Florida, CFP appears to
be expanding northwards into the Gulf of Mexico, highlighted by the recent identification of toxic fish in the Flower
Garden Marine Sanctuary off of the Texas/Louisiana coast. Ciguatoxin is a novel type of voltage-gated ion
channel toxin. In nerve tissues, ciguatoxin causes a tetrodotoxin-sensitive increase in sodium ion permeability
and depolarization of the resting membrane. Depending on the magnitude of the depolarization, the
consequence can be an increase in excitability of the neuronal membrane or a depolarizing type of conduction
block at high concentrations. The onset of CFP is typically characterized by gastrointestinal and neurological
symptoms and signs typically persist for days to weeks, with vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain,
dysesthesia, pruritus, myalgia being common. Severe cases of ciguatera may involve hypotension and
bradycardia, but fatalities are rare. Occasionally, neurological signs may persist for several months. Remarkably,
the diagnosis of ciguatera is still largely dependent on the astuteness of the clinician. In the absence of a
confirmatory laboratory test, a sizable proportion of cases still go undiagnosed and unreported. The enigmatic
nature of CFP events, coupled with a lack of sustained scientific research on the environmental and physiological
factors that contribute to outbreaks, has hindered progress in the development of management strategies to
protect people against exposure to ciguatoxins. The purpose of this project, therefore, is to establish a Greater
Caribbean Center for Ciguatera Research to 1) examine the role climate change may play in the geographic and
temporal expansion of CFP into more temperate latitudes; 2) obtain a better understanding of the toxic
metabolites produced by certain Gambierdiscus strains, and the subsequent transfer and biotransformation of
these compounds into coastal/reef food webs; and 3) study the genotoxicity and impacts on cellular metabolism
caused by these toxins upon exposure."
11032947,"Ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP), the most common form of finfish-borne disease globally, affecting tens of
thousands of people each year, is caused by dinoflagellates in the genus Gambierdiscus. Our goal is to
investigate how climate change, particularly warming sea surface temperatures, will influence the geographic
extent and population dynamics of toxin-producing Gambierdiscus spp. in the Greater Caribbean Region
(GCR), and use these findings to model ciguatoxin fluxes into coral reef food webs under predicted climate
change scenarios. This proposal builds on several important findings from our previous work, which includes
the determination that toxicity in the GCR is tightly linked to just a few Gambierdiscus species, and that the
most toxic species G. silvae may be the âsuper bugâ on Caribbean reefs, responsible for the bulk of toxin
entering the food web even at low cell densities. This breakthrough discovery presents a fortuitous opportunity
to study the physiology, toxicity, and ecology of this highly toxigenic species, including its temperature
tolerances and the manner in which it disperses to and colonizes other regions. The scientific premise of this
project is that only through a deep understanding of the autecology of the most toxic species and their direct
and indirect responses to climate change (e.g., warming sea surface temperatures and coral reef impacts,
respectively), will we (society) be able to properly assess and respond to the impact of climate change on CFP
incidence in the GCR. We will use innovative experimental approaches to examine the impacts of temperature,
including field investigations of local adaptation within and dispersal between Gambierdiscus sub-populations
using RADseq (Restriction site-Associated DNA sequencing) and analyses of the spatio-temporal dynamics of
toxin-producing Gambierdiscus spp. In addition to investigating broad-scale geographic patterns, we will use
natural temperature differences between closely adjacent sites to explore the effects of temperature extremes
and variability on the composition of Gambierdiscus communities. These natural experiments will be
complemented by laboratory studies to determine resilience of toxin-producing Gambierdiscus spp. to thermal
stress under variable temperature regimes. Together, these data will reveal how temperature-driven
partitioning of Gambierdiscus communities operates at local, regional, and seasonal scales. This has major
implications with respect to the effects of climate-driven warming on the extent and prevalence of ciguatera
toxicity in the GCR. The resulting data, along with that produced in RP2 and RP3, will enable us to further
develop and calibrate our ciguatoxin flux model, which is the first-ever computational model of ciguatoxin fluxes
in the food web. This modeling effort will push forward the boundaries of predictive capacity for CFP events
and public health protection."
10861712,"Project Summary/Abstract
Postpartum smoking relapse rates have remained stagnant for over a decade with more than 50% of those
who are able to achieve smoking abstinence during pregnancy relapsing within the first few months after
childbirth. Maternal cigarette smoking results in significant increases in a variety of negative health
consequences for both mother and child. Second-hand smoke exposure to newborns and infants increases
their risk of both acute and chronic illness. Therefore, research to identify safe and novel postpartum smoking
relapse prevention intervention is warranted. Our preliminary data indicates that the delivery of exogenous
progesterone (Prog) in the early postpartum period reduces several smoking relapse related risk factors (e.g.,
craving) and was also associated with a higher prevalence of smoking abstinence at 12-weeks postpartum.
These observations concur with a wealth of prior literature that demonstrates the protective effects of
progesterone on a variety of addictive behaviors. In our other preliminary work looking at non-pregnant
premenopausal women, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate or DMPA, which blocks ovulation for 12-weeks
which subsequently decreases estradiol levels, was associated with longer previous quit attempts and reduced
smoking motives. These observations have shaped our central hypothesis which is that the combination of
Prog + DMPA; i.e., increased progesterone and decreased estradiol will prevent postpartum smoking relapse.
To examine this hypothesis, we will conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial that
will be implemented by an experienced, transdisciplinary, and productive team of investigators from two sites
to enhance the diversity of the study sample and generalizability of the results. We will enroll healthy pregnant
women (n=320) who have recently quit smoking and intend to stay abstinent postpartum. Using a 2Ã2 factorial
design, participants will be randomized into one of four assignments: (1) Prog + DMPA, (2) Prog + placebo, (3)
placebo + DMPA, and (4) placebo + placebo. Participants will be followed for days to smoking relapse (primary
outcome), smoking relapse-related risk factors (e.g., craving), and infant health outcomes from gestational
week 36 through 9 months postpartum. This study proposes a safe and innovative intervention to examine the
impact of manipulating postpartum physiological to influence the behavior of a new mother which will lead to
improved health outcomes for her and her infant. The implications of this novel study will directly advance the
current state of the science by expanding on the role of Prog and DMPA in addressing smoking-related
behaviors within this highly vulnerable population. Further, should our central hypothesis be supported, the
clinical translatability of this intervention is high and may be immediately pursued."
10624341,"Project Summary
Chronic exposure to high levels of manganese (Mn) causes manganism, a neurological disorder
which shares multiple pathological features with Parkinson's disease (PD). Mn-induced
neurotoxicity includes decreased expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a rate-limiting enzyme
in dopamine synthesis, and dopaminergic neuronal injury. But the mechanisms of the Mn-induced
neurotoxicity are not completely understood. Estrogenic compounds, such as tamoxifen, a
selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), have been shown to be protective in Mn toxicity
and PD, but their mode of action remains to be established. While the transcription factor RE1-
silencing transcription factor (REST) was initially described as a repressor of neuronal genes in
non-neuronal cells during development, it has recently been shown to play a critical role in
protection of adult neurons, and it activates genes that are involved in neuroprotection. Our
preliminary data reveal that Mn decreased REST, whereas TX increased its expression in TH-
expressing neuronal cells. REST protected dopaminergic neurons against Mn neurotoxicity by
attenuating Mn-induced oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. These findings indicate that
REST may mediate TX-induced neuroprotection against Mn toxicity in dopaminergic neurons.
Therefore, investigating the mechanisms of REST in Mn-induced neurotoxicity and TX-induced
protection against Mn toxicity is critical to advance our understanding of Mn neurotoxicity and in
developing therapeutic strategies to treat neurodegenerative diseases associated with
dysfunction of dopaminergic neurons. We hypothesize that REST protects against Mn
neurotoxicity by enhancing expression of TH, as well as the antioxidant/antiapoptotic genes
catalase (CAT) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and mediates TX-induced protection against Mn
toxicity via genomic ERÎ± and nongenomic ERÎ±/GPR30 pathways. Our hypothesis will be tested
in the following specific aims: 1) Test if REST in DAergic neurons is protective against Mn
neurotoxicity in mice, 2) Investigate mechanisms of Mn-induced REST reduction and the
protective effects of REST against Mn neurotoxicity via upregulation of TH, CAT and Bcl-2, and
3) Test if DAergic REST is a critical mediator of TX-induced neuroprotection against Mn toxicity.
The outcome of the study will provide critical information on the role of REST in DAergic neuronal
function, Mn toxicity and TX-induced neuroprotection against Mn toxicity. The results also greatly
contribute to the development of `neuroSERMs' to treat NDs associated with DAergic injury, such
as manganism and potentially PD."
10840314,"Project Summary: Enormous strides continue to be made in the design of nanoparticles as highly specialized
therapeutics for achieving superior outcomes over standard pharmacological agents, the latter often associated
with significant toxicity that limits treatment efficacy. While cancer immunotherapies have revolutionized the
treatment of disease and shown therapeutic benefits in hard-to-treat cancers, these agents are limited, for
example, by immune-related adverse events and off-target effects in immunosuppressive microenvironments.
Novel, emerging anti-cancer strategies are therefore critically needed to overcome these limitations and improve
durable response rates in combination with immune therapies. One promising strategy exploits the unique âself-
therapeuticâ capabilities of the nanomaterials themselves â the treatment of tumors without the need for cytotoxic
drugs. These capabilities are governed by the intrinsic physico-chemical properties of these materials, which can
lead to disruption of signal transduction pathways, cell cross-talk or invasion, and/or induced cell death programs
within the tumor microenvironment (TME) â providing unprecedented opportunities for combating disease. We
have developed specialized ultrasmall fluorescent core-shell silica nanoparticles, Cornell prime dots (C' dots),
with intrinsic therapeutic capabilities enabling a distinct combination of activities that (1) selectively and directly
induce cancer cell death through the iron-dependent mechanism of ferroptosis and (2) modulate immune cells
directly by priming T cells and polarizing macrophages toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype. As CD8+ T cells
are known to also regulate ferroptosis during immunotherapy, such effects are expected to synergize with those
induced by C' dots. A long-term goal of this proposal is to determine critical C' dot physico-chemical parameters
responsible for maximizing responses to these intrinsic therapeutic activities. In Aim I, we will examine the extent
to which changes in the structural properties of PEG-coated C' dots, plain or modified to specifically bind to
melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1-R; a well-established target overexpressed by our syngeneic murine models and
human melanomas), influence therapeutic efficacy in syngeneic melanoma models by modulating ferroptosis
and the tumor microenvironment, in the presence and absence of checkpoint blockade. In Aim II, we will probe
underlying mechanisms driving regulation of immune cell phenotype and/or induction of ferroptosis in vitro. The
successful completion of the project will provide critical insights into (i) key structural parameters modulating the
combined self-therapeutic activities of these particles related to their induction of ferroptosis and priming the
tumor immune microenvironment; (ii) whether critical differences exist in particle characteristics needed to
optimize these distinct activities; (iii) mechanisms underpinning these activities; and (iv) therapeutic strategies
that maximize potent anti-tumor effects in syngeneic melanoma models by administering therapeutic doses of
particles in tandem with checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4)."
10850636,"Project Abstract
 The growing population of persons with dementia presents challenges to providing high quality nursing
home (NH) care. Care is complicated by behavioral and psychosocial symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as
aggression, vocal outbursts, wandering, and withdrawal that occur as persons with dementia lose cognitive
and communication abilities and cannot verbally express unmet physical and psychosocial needs. NH staff
use âelderspeak,â speech similar to baby talk that is demeaning to residents. Residents react to elderspeak
with BPSD resulting in increased use of psychotropic medication to control BPSD, higher staffing needs, more
staff stress and turnover, and increased costs. The Changing Talk (CHAT) training program educates staff
about elderspeak and person-centered communication strategies and is proven to reduce staff elderspeak and
BPSD. The next step to increase the impact of this effective classroom-based training is to test CHAT content
provided in online internet modules. Providing this training online (CHATO) can improve access for busy staff
and those in rural and small NHs to increase dissemination across care settings to improve dementia care.
 This continuing renewal study will test a new, online version of CHAT, a nonpharmacological
intervention that effectively decreases staff elderspeak communication and subsequently reduces BPSD in NH
residents with dementia. The interactive CHATO modules provide flexible access to training, continuously
accessible to staff via the internet. In this pragmatic trial, 120 NHs will be randomly assigned to CHATO training
or to the control group. BPSD and psychotropic medication rate data, extracted from the Center for Medicare
and Medicaid Services Nursing Home Compare and Minimum Data Set, will be compared using linear mixed
modeling. NH strategies used to engage staff (paid time to complete, recognition) and other supports will be
analyzed in relation to staff participation rates and changes in the outcome measures. Costs will be determined
in relation to changes in the outcomes and ongoing use and reinforcement of training will be assessed at a
one-year follow-up survey for participating nursing homes. The overall goal of this study is to prepare for large
scale dissemination and implementation of this evidence-based nonpharmacological intervention to reduce
RTC for residents with dementia across long term care settings.
 This research addresses NIA's milestones for nonpharmacological dementia care interventions, NINR's
symptom management and caregiver support missions, the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease goal
to enhance care quality and efficiency, and the Alzheimer's Association Plan to build a workforce with high-
quality care skills. Reducing inappropriate use of psychoactive medications to control BPSD is the top priority
goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care. As the number of persons with dementia triples in
the next 30 years, empowering care providers to provide high quality dementia care is of critical importance."
10907452,"Metastasis is the major cause of mortality in human breast cancer. The mechanisms by which the primary tumor
microenvironment promotes the invasion and intravasation of tumor cells has been extensively studied. In
contrast, the mechanisms regulating extravasation of blood-borne tumor cells at distal sites, their
survival and proliferation in their new microenvironment, and their re-dissemination to additional sites,
are less studied and not well understood. Therefore, the investigation of the mechanisms that regulate
breast cancer cells at the metastatic site are an area of intense scientific interest with important clinical
applications.
CTCs efficiently disseminate throughout the body but form metastases with low frequency. The CTCs that
successfully extravasate, survive and grow at distal sites have acquired stem-like characteristics that promote
these processes. The acquisition of stem-like properties is closely linked to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT). Thus, the transcriptional control of stemness and EMT is an important regulator of metastatic efficiency.
Stemness and/or EMT is induced by metabolic, hypoxic and redox stress, as well as by interactions with
macrophages and platelets. Understanding the regulation of tumor cell stemness by stromal cells could lead to
the identification of novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of metastatic disease.
Previous studies on the role of stemness in metastasis to distal sites has been significantly limited by the analytic
methods used. We have developed ground-breaking new techniques that allow us to directly interrogate the
relationship between stemness and the efficiency of extravasation, survival and growth in vivo. Our novel imaging
methods combine the use of a permanent lung imaging window compatible with multiphoton microscopy, novel
computational reconstructions of large fields of view, and newly developed biosensors that report on the
induction of stemness, hypoxia and ROS. These tools allow the visualization and analysis of breast cancer cells
as they extravasate and form metastatic colonies in the lung. In contrast, traditional end-point analyses of fixed
tissues cannot provide information on the role of stemness during extravasation and metastatic growth.
This Program Project is organized around three major questions. First, we will define the signaling pathways that
regulate breast cancer cells in the lung metastatic niche. Second, we will explore the induction of stem-like
properties in tumor cells by interactions with stromal cells, as a critical regulator of extravasation and subsequent
metastatic growth in the lung. Third, we will pursue novel preliminary data on the effects of chemotherapy in the
metastatic site. Taking advantage of important synergies between the Projects and innovative methodological
advances by the Cores, this PPG is well-positioned to make ground-breaking contributions to our understanding
of CTC extravasation and grow in the lung, as well as their re-disseminate to tertiary sites. These studies will
provide paradigm-shifting insights into the biology of metastasis, with important implications for the clinical
treatment of systemic metastatic disease in breast cancer."

Child sexual abuse is one of the most disturbing issues confronting the public health sector. It is estimated that
one in four girls and one in eight boys will be sexually abused before reaching the age of 18. Moreover, victims
of such abuse are known to experience a wide range of psychiatric, behavioral, and relationship problems over
their lifetimes. While much progress has been made in recognizing that child sexual abuse is a major public
health problem, there have been few rigorous studies of tertiary prevention interventions designed to minimize
re-offending amongst those individuals who have perpetrated child sexual abuse. The only random clinical trial
with adult males, who perpetrate the vast majority of sexual abuse, began in 1985 and its final results were
published in 2005. This study, funded by the State of California and a state enhancement grant from the
National Institute on Mental Health, found no differences between treated and untreated sexual offenders using
a first-generation relapse prevention approach, although they found some indications of effectiveness in those
who met the treatment program goals. This proposal describes a feasibility and pilot study of a model tertiary
prevention program designed to target adult men who have committed child sexual abuse. This model
intervention was developed with input from a panel of international experts in sexual offender treatment
convened in September 2019 with funding from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of
Canada and the Eunice Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Development. This application proposes
a small pilot study with a sample drawn from male inmates incarcerated by the Minnesota Department of
Corrections (MnDOC) and within 20-24 months of release from sentences for criminal sexual conduct against
victims aged under 14 years of age. Participants will be randomly assigned to either complete the model
intervention or receive treatment as usual through MnDOC. Data will be collected on the process of
intervention implementation and outcomes of the intervention as measured by participant self-report and
reports of disciplinary actions experienced during participantsâ incarceration. Data will also be collected on
factors that could influence outcome, such as therapist characteristics, participant characteristics, motivation,
and participation. Process measures related to intervention completion, barriers encountered, and fidelity to
the intervention will be obtained. The purpose of this proposed project is to provide information and data that
will allow for the design and development of a multinational, random assignment, long-term effectiveness
study. Thus, statistical analysis will explore effect size rather than statistical significance and issues
encountered will be documented. This will allow for calculation of necessary sample size and for modification
of the intervention and methods for a subsequent study to explore the effectiveness of the model intervention
across jurisdictions and cultures."
10836973,"All cells are subject to and respond to mechanical forces like compression. However the molecular mechanisms
linking the mechanics to biological responses are not fully understood. The cells of our model system, the
chondrocytes of cartilage, undergo compression in vivo, and these cells can transduce compression into
biological signals. There is evidence that glucose utilization in chondrocytes is regulated by compression and
that physiologic compression stimulates glycolysis, the main pathway chondrocytes use to make ATP. This
phenomenon has been linked to the ability of chondrocytes to maintain cartilage. Thus, the study of glucose
metabolism is relevant to NIH because millions suffer from chondrocyte-driven cartilage deterioration in
osteoarthritis. Current osteoarthritis treatments involve joint motion, which is counterintuitive. We show for the
first time that physiologically relevant culture conditions enable in vitro compression of chondrocytes. This
project tests the hypothesis that physiological compression of both normal and osteoarthritic chondrocytes
results in a specific pattern of metabolites within glucose metabolism that support protein production to maintain
the cellular microenvironment. The premise is that by quantifying glucose metabolism in chondrocytes this
project will develop strategies that use mechanical loading to produce the building blocks for cartilage repair.
Aim 1 - In vitro experiments will examine the source of carbon (glucose or glutamine) and the mechanism of
regulation. Dependent variables include sex, donor age and the level (low or high) of applied compression.
Targeted metabolomics data will be generated from normal and osteoarthritic chondrocytes subjected to
compression under different experimental conditions. Aim 2 - Experiments using mice subjected to voluntary
running will assess in vivo mechanotransduction. Dependent variables include sex and the duration of running.
Readouts will include both targeted metabolites and immunohistological markers examining regulation of
glucose metabolism. Assays will employ highly specific enzyme inhibitors that will allow a step-by-step analysis
of critical metabolic pathways. This project has substantial innovation including a novel systems biology model
and analytical approach that calculate the relative rates of reaction for each step in glucose metabolism. These
modeling results will be used both to refine existing hypotheses and to generate new ones. The goal of this
project is to identify changes in patterns of small metabolites that result from compression for normal and
osteoarthritic chondrocytes. The expected outcome is to identify candidate target reactions that leverage
glucose metabolism to increase mechanically driven production of amino acid precursors to repair cartilage.
Understanding these mechanisms may prove useful in developing translational strategies to heal cartilage by
activating existing mechanosensitive pathways. Insight into how chondrocytes respond to compression will
advance osteoarthritis translation by providing new therapeutic targets for cartilage repair and enabling
substantial clinical progress."
10771955,"Alzheimerâs disease (AD) is the most common form of senile dementia without effective treatments after
countless number of clinical trials for over decades. This application proposes in vitro and in vivo evaluation of
targeting human tau-tubulin kinase (TTBK1), a neuron specific tau kinase involved in the phosphorylation and
aggregation of microtubule-associated protein tau in human and mice and genetically associated with late-
onset AD in Spanish and Chinese cohorts. TTBK1 protein expression was significantly increased in the frontal
cortex of postmortem AD brains compared to the control subject, suggesting that TTBK1 may play critical roles
in AD pathogenesis. Our recent neuropathological examination of postmortem brain tissues revealed abundant
expression of TTBK1 in the entorhinal cortex (EC) layer II and CA1 region of the hippocampal field where early
tau pathology evolves in AD. Importantly, several studies reported that CA1 neuronal loss was correlated with
cognitive decline in AD, and that CA1 connectivity to medial temporal cortex was associated with reduced
episodic memory with mild cognitive impairment patients as determined by functional MRI. Interestingly, we
found that TTBK1 significantly reduced axonal integrity of EC pyramidal neurons in AD mouse model,
mimicking the early AD pathology. Thus, suppressing initial pathological tau accumulation in the EC and their
spread to CA1 region by targeting TTBK1 could halt progression of AD at the prodromal stage. There are
several attempts to develop TTBK1 kinase inhibitors, which were unsuccessful due to their cross-reactivity with
TTBK2, a ubiquitous tau-tubulin kinase involved in mitosis and ciliogenesis. In this proposal, we will test the
therapeutic specificity and efficiency of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting TTBK1, which have little
cross-reactivity to TTBK2. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that ASO-TTBK1 reduces accumulation
and spread of pathological tau in early-stage AD brains. Our exciting preliminary data have shown that ASO-
TTBK1 significantly reduced the level of phosphorylated tau at pSer396, pThr231 and pThr181 in the
hippocampal region in PS19 tau mice. We will examine the therapeutic effect of ASO-TTBK1 on tau pathology
and cognitive function in PS19 mice and our recently developed early tau propagation model (ECII-CA1 tau
mice, Aim 1). We will further validate the effect of ASO-TTBK1 on tau pathology in human induced pluripotent
stem cell-derived neurons and organoids isolated from late onset AD and FTDP-17 (P301L MAPT) cases in
vitro (Aim 2) and on human TTBK1 transgenic and TTBK1:APP knock-in double transgenic mice in vivo (Aim
3). Successful completion of these experiments will validate TTBK1 as a therapeutic target of tauopathy and
ASO as a translatable approach for targeting TTBK1 in AD brains."
10595613,"Background: As many as 7 out of 10 hospitalized patients experience asymptomatic blood pressure (BP)
elevations while in the hospital. However, no guidelines exist to guide the management of inpatient BP
elevations. And, literature suggests treating these elevations with short-acting âas neededâ BP medications
(PRN BP), especially if asymptomatic, may be harmful. Despite this, many providers treat asymptomatic BP
elevations with PRN BP.
Significance: Adverse events due to overtreatment of inpatient BP elevations may lead to poor patient
outcomes and higher hospitalization costs. Veterans, by virtue of older age and high prevalence of co-
morbidities, are a population at high risk for adverse effects from inpatient BP treatment. Thus, it is vital to
understand the practice patterns and provider motivations for PRN BP prescribing in VA hospitals in order to
design interventions to target proper PRN BP use in hospitals. Such interventions can be tested for impact on
safety and cost attributable to this practice. This work addresses VHA HSR&D priorities of Quality and Safety
of Health Care, Health Care Value and Health Care Informatics.
Innovation and Impact: The proposed work is novel in that it leverages extensive clinical electronic health
record and administrative data and marries it with granular data from provider and nursing interviews (locally at
a single VA hospital) and a national survey to better understand the full arc of predictors and motivations for
prescribing in a low cost, timely fashion. Ultimately, the impact of this project is that it will provide fundamental
infromation that will lead to the design, development and testing of interventions aimed at optimizing provider
and nursing use of PRN BP. This intervention can be tested via cluster randomized trials to optimize related
safety and costs of care.
Specific Aims: Aim 1. To identify the prevalence of PRN BP use, and the sociodemographic and clinical
factors associated with PRN BP use among Veterans hospitalized in VA hospitals nationally from FY16-
FY20. Aim 2. To understand provider, nursing and system-level factors motivating PRN blood pressure use in
VA hospitals through qualitative research techniques
Methods: We will use VINCI resources to create a cohort from the national VHA of all Veterans consisting of
all non-intensive care unit admissions to VA hospitals in FY16-20. Using several VA data sources including the
Pharmacy Benefit Management and the Corporate Data Warehouse, we will define PRN BP use during
hospitalization and collect diagnosis codes and specific clinical data including BP and kidney function
measures. In Aim 1, will describe the prevalence of PRN BP prescribing and factors that predict prescription of
PRN BP. In Aim 2, we will complement our findings from Aim 1 through 1 on 1 interviews with providers and
nurses at a single VA tertiary care hospital to explore system-level and individual-level motivating factors for
PRN BP use. We will use themes that emerge from interviews to design a survey to be distributed nationally to
all VA inpatient providers and nurses to understand regional and institutional variations in drivers of PRN BP
use.
Next Steps/Implementation. Armed with new knowledge from this project, the next step will be to create an
intervention that will be directed at optimizing inpatient PRN BP use for those with asymptomatic BP
elevations. The intervention would then be tested locally and later nationally via cluster randomized trial to
determine the impact of implementation on provider practice patterns and key safety and cost outcomes."
10844347,"Project Summary/Abstract
Richterâs syndrome (RS) is a critical complication of up to 10% of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients,
which develops as an aggressive transformation into a diffuse large B cell histology, and is mostly refractory to
existing therapies. RS pathogenesis remains largely unknown and cellular and mouse models for molecular
studies are limited. To address this challenge, Dr. ten Hacken has developed novel human-genetics inspired
mouse models through CRISPR-Cas9 multiplexed B-cell editing, recapitulating CLL transformation into RS.
Already through her preliminary studies, Dr. ten Hacken demonstrated how selected mutational co-occurrences
facilitate disease transformation, and are associated to distinct transcriptional changes and therapeutic
vulnerabilitiesâwork that is presently near completion. Dr. ten Hacken is now planning to introduce a new set of
mutations in genes involved in epigenetic programming of B cells, which were identified as putative RS drivers
in recent human genomic analyses. In Aim 1, Dr. ten Hacken will introduce epigenetic drivers in mice to assess
the impact of the selected alterations (and their combinations) on CLL transformation. As part of this Aim, Dr.
ten Hacken will also assess the transcriptional and genetic faithfulness of these models to human disease. In
Aim 2, Dr. ten Hacken will functionally characterize the modeled gene mutations, while dissecting changes in
the epigenetic landscape underlying transformation of CLL into RS. Epigenetic dependencies identified through
these studies will be cross-compared with human RS datasets and validated in human primary samples with
similar genetic make-ups. In Aim 3, Dr. ten Hacken will perform in vitro and in vivo preclinical testing of a panel
of agents (comprehensive of chemotherapy and novel targeted agents) in order to design mutation (or co-
mutation) specific treatment strategies. To carry out the proposed work, Dr. ten Hacken has enlisted
collaborators who are experts in computational biology, systems immunology, mouse pathology, molecular
pharmacology, biostatistics, functional genomics and epigenetics. Dr. ten Hacken has outlined a 3-year career
development plan that will allow her to foster her personal professional development (including leadership, grant
writing, negotiation and communication skills), and to gain additional scientific training in bioinformatics and
biostatistics. Dr. ten Hackenâs independent research program will be focused on translational research in
hematological malignancies, with the longer-term objective of undertaking clinical correlative research and
functional genomic analyses of other lymphoid and myeloid malignancies. Through her proposed work, Dr. ten
Hacken anticipates to contribute 2 high-impact manuscripts within the award term. She will present yearly at
international conferences, and will be ready for her first R01 submission towards the end of Year 2. The proposed
studies are expected to provide critical insight into the biology and natural history of Richterâs syndrome, and the
mouse models Dr. ten Hacken is developing will represent useful tools to dissect pathogenic mechanisms and
test novel treatment strategies for this largely incurable malignancy."
10625839,"Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most common mental health diagnoses
among Veterans. Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and prolonged exposure therapy (PE) were widely
disseminated in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) as recommended PTSD treatments. Despite these
efforts, few post-9/11 Veterans diagnosed with PTSD initiate CPT or PE. In the small percentage of Veterans
who receive these therapies, CPT and PE are rarely the first treatment a Veteran receives. A common
treatment sequence identified in implementation research, begins with âstabilization treatment,â combinations
of psychosocial and medication treatments that prepare Veterans for CPT or PE. A gap in existing research is
how treatment sequences, particularly stabilization treatment, influence initiation of CPT or PE.
Significance/Impact: PTSD is an HSR&D priority condition due to its substantial negative biopsychosocial
impact on Veterans lives. Novel strategies are needed to increase engagement, retention, and improve
outcomes from recommended PTSD treatments, and to reduce disparities in access to this care.
Understanding how to most effectively combine and sequence PTSD treatment is an HSR&D identified area of
interest, and a research gap identified in the VHA PTSD clinical practice guideline.
Innovation: Despite consistently identifying stabilization treatment as a common VHA practice, little research
has investigated this treatment sequence. A novel approach to solving existing limitations in PTSD treatment
delivery involves developing an intervention that both acknowledges the ubiquitous presence and benefits of
stabilization treatment, while facilitating timely transition from stabilization treatment to CPT or PE.
Specific Aims: This CDA-2 aims to improve delivery of PTSD services in the VHA, while simultaneously
providing me with training in health services research methods to support my development into an independent
VHA researcher. The proposed research aims are: (1) To qualitatively understand Veteransâ and cliniciansâ
perspectives on selecting stabilization treatments and how stabilization treatment serves as a barrier or
facilitator of transition to CPT or PE; (2) To develop and conduct a randomized, pragmatic pilot trial of a brief,
Veteran-centered intervention to support transition from stabilization treatment to CPT or PE; and (3) To
identify sociodemographic disparities in treatment sequences and to determine how treatment sequences
influence time to CPT or PE initiation across the VHA.
Methodology: I will then conduct qualitative interviews with a national sample of Veterans (n=30) and
clinicians (n=20; Aim 1). Using rapid qualitative analysis procedures, I will evaluate how treatment sequences,
particularly stabilization treatment, are chosen and how they serve as a barrier or facilitator of transition to CPT
and PE. I will then use knowledge gained from Aim 1 to develop a health services intervention that facilitates
timely transition to CPT or PE. I will test this intervention in a randomized, pragmatic, pilot trial comparing the
intervention (n=20) to treatment as usual (n=20; Aim 2). I will assess the proportion of Veterans who initiate
CPT or PE within a year after beginning the intervention as a primary outcome and feasibility as a secondary
outcome. Using electronic health record data from a national, longitudinal cohort of post-9/11 Veterans who
received VHA PTSD treatment (anticipated n=400,000) from 10/05-12/23, I will identify treatment sequences;
understand how treatment sequence impacts time to CPT or PE initiation using Cox proportional hazard
regression; and identify disparities in treatment sequences based on sociodemographic characteristics (Aim 3).
Implementation/Next Steps: I will apply the knowledge and training gained through this proposal to an
HSR&D Merit application to test the benefits of the developed intervention on a large scale through a multisite
hybrid type-II pragmatic trial. I will collaborate with organizational partners at the Office of Mental Health and
Suicide Prevention to ensure that work supports efforts to promote clinical practice guideline-consistent care."

Overall
The overall goal of this Center is to further understand and probe the neural network central to obsessive
compulsive disorder (OCD) and the abnormalities within that network that are associated with impaired
behavioral flexibility that is reflected in persistent avoidance, a key clinical feature of the disease. The rostral
and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (rACC and dACC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
(vlPFC), insula and the striatum are associated with abnormalities in OCD and are the cortical nodes in the OCD
network (OCDnet). The Center hypothesis is that the behavioral inflexibility reflected in persistent avoidance in
OCD is the result of circuit dysfunction between central nodes in the OCD network (OCDnet). Collectively we
will use a multimodal, cross-species network approach to achieve 3 overarching aims: 1. Identify cortical regions
within the OCDnet that cross-link circuit connections to other nodes; 2. Understand how impairments in
behavioral flexibility that results in persistence avoidance are associated with these connections in OCD patients
compared to healthy control subjects; and 3. Study the effects of modulation on these circuits and on behavioral
inflexibility. Specifically, Aim 1 will use a combination of animal studies (P1, 2), and human studies (P1, 3,
Cores B, C) to characterize the OCDnet circuits anatomically, physiologically, and behaviorally; Aim 2 will
characterize how impairments in a newly developed probabilistic approach avoidance task PAAT are linked to
the abnormalities in the OCDnet (P2-4, Core B-D); and Aim 3 will modulate the OCDnet in OCD patients using
both conventional treatments (P4) and direct circuit manipulations (P5) (Cores B-D). Collectively, these studies
will further our understanding of circuit interactions of key brain regions implicated in OCD, their involvement in
behavioral inflexibility that results in persistent avoidance associated with OCD, and the effects of
neuromodulation of those circuits."
10844445,"PROJECT SUMMARY â Overall
The long-term goal of the National Center for Interventional Biophotonic Technologies (NCIBT) is to promote
public health by advancing a new paradigm for intraprocedural, image-guided decision making. The Center's
strategy is to advance optical spectroscopy and imaging technologies, to develop means of providing imaging
results to medical practitioners at the time, in the form, and within the context they will be most useful in guiding
decisions, and to maximize the impact of this work by involving as many scientists and physicians as possible in
developing and using these technologies. Initially, the Center will promote technological advancements of
interventional fluorescence lifetime imaging (iFLIM) and interferometric diffuse optical spectroscopy (iDOS) and
their translation into clinical use. An open-ended intraprocedural platform will incorporate them and, eventually,
complementary optical imaging technologies. Specifically, NCIBT will (1) advance scalable optical imaging
technology, built from the perspective of intelligent optical system design, to characterize tissue properties in the
most effective manner; (2) develop an intraprocedural platform that physically incorporates these technologies
and integrates the resulting imaging data, details of the procedure, and patient-specific information within AI-
based decision algorithms that guide, in real-time, therapeutic decisions, and (3) disseminate these technological
advancements to research institutions and medical centers. The significance of this project derives from its
potential for rapid advancement, catalyzed by an AI-directed holistic approach to instrument design, of its optical
imaging technologies and platform and their relevance to managing humanity's most common afflictions - cancer,
stroke, heart disease, trauma, infection, and degenerative diseases. NCIBT will ensure the national impact of
these technological advancements by creating and expanding a network of collaborative research and service
projects broadly distributed nationwide and implementing a comprehensive training and dissemination program.
Annual workshops, hand-on training sessions at national meetings, in special courses and at UC Davis,
presentations and publications will educate, train, equip and diversify potential users of NCIBT technology.
Bridging gaps between engineering and medicine and between technology development and clinical application
will ensure that the needed technologies are developed and applied clinically to improve the nation's health."
11194918,"The peripheral blood contains only a small fraction of the total number of lymphocytes in the body. Therefore, a thorough understanding of T-cell dynamics, including SIV/SHIV/HIV-mediated T cell depletion, T-cell trafficking and immune reconstitution following combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), requires a direct whole body in vivo visualization of lymphoid tissues. Although in the past decades immunologists have attempted to address some of these questions using optical imaging technologies, the latter are unable to generate quantitative information from deep tissues, due to attenuation and scattering of low energy photons, hence limiting their use to rodent models. NIAID scientists have demonstrated the feasibility of CD4 pool in vivo imaging in non-human primates using intact or fragmented anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies radiolabeled with single photon gamma or positron emitters, and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) or Positron Emission Tomography (PET) cameras, respectively. Although both SPECT and PET document differences in CD4 pools of lymphoid tissues between healthy and SIV/SHIV CD4 depleted animals, PETâs higher sensitivity, resolution and unique quantitative imaging capability allows the quantification of the absolute number of CD4 receptors (per unit volume of tissue), in vivo, as recently reported. Ibalizumab is an FDA-approved recombinant humanized IgG4 mouse anti-human-CD4 monoclonal antibody administered intravenously (IV) for the treatment of multi-drug resistant HIV infection. The NIAID team has successfully radiolabeled Ibalizumab via a deferoxamine conjugate with Zirconium-89 (89Zr), a positron emitter with a 78h half-life that allows serial imaging over at least 1 week with the additional benefit of commercial distribution and ease of patient scheduling as compared to other positron emitters such as 64Cu (12.7h half-life). They have developed and validated the methods and quality control for conjugating Ibalizumab with deferoxamine (DF-Ibalizumab) and radiolabeling with 89Zr to produce 89Zr-DF-Ibalizumab using established methods and have recently produced PET images of the whole-body CD4 pool in healthy and SIV CD4 depleted macaques with quality similar to those generated with previously developed PET anti-CD4 probes in the NIAID program. This proof-of-concept study aims to establish the safety and capability of a GMP developed 89Zr-DF-Ibalizumab to visualize the CD4 pool in humans through a single-site, open-label, non-randomized, phase 1 trial."
10875383,"This application for a Practice-based Suicide Prevention Center (PAR-20-286), ETUDES (Enhancing Treatment
and Utilization for Depression and Emergent Suicidality) is a competitive renewal of our current Alacrity P50. We
aim to address the crisis in adolescent suicide, with special attention to Black youth, for whom the rate of suicide
attempts has increased more rapidly than in any other demographic group. We will develop and test effective
methods for identifying and intervening with youth at risk for suicide that can be readily deployed in pediatric
primary care (PPC). We focus on PPC because most youth visit PPC annually, youth are routinely screened
annually for depression and suicidal risk, and mental health treatment delivered in primary care can decrease
disparities in access and outcomes. We focus on the following strategies to reduce suicidal behaviors: (1)
improved identification to complement screening; (2) promote linkages to services and safety planning; and (3)
targeting risk factors for depression and suicidality to prevent the onset of suicidal crises. In the first component
of our signature R01, we will develop prediction models that combine machine learning algorithms using EHR
data and mobile sensing to improve our detection of imminent suicidal risk in a cohort of 2,000 youth, recruited
from PPC. In the 2nd component of the R01, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial on a subset of this
cohort, 900 suicidal youth, comparing usual care to a suite of tools that we have developed to help PPC providers
assess and manage suicidal youth. In previous work, these tools increased physician referrals to mental health
and engagement in treatment, and reduced suicidal behavior. We propose three R34s that target domains that
increase risk for depression and suicidality, namely, online victimization, low activity/anhedonia, and poor sleep.
To address the national crisis of rising suicidal behavior in Black youth, we will recruit a sample that is at least
35% Black, and apply implementation science methods to ensure that all assessments and interventions are
acceptable and effective for Black youth and their families. Moreover, our methods of identification and
interventions target probable sources of racial disparities in suicidal behavior, namely, treatment access, online
victimization, low activity, and poor sleep. This Center renewal convenes a diverse, interdisciplinary team, with
expertise in clinical trials and longitudinal studies, machine learning, mobile sensing, health disparities, and
implementation science. All aims are guided by collaboration with stakeholders, some of whom play leadership
roles in the Center. Primary to the Centerâs mission is the training and support of a diverse group of 10 early
career scientists who play critical roles in Center projects. If successful, Center projects should yield predictive
algorithms for imminent suicidal risk to complement annual screening, a care pathway for suicidal adolescents
that can be implemented in PPC and will substantially reduce suicide-related events, and interventions to prevent
depression and suicidal behavior. These tools aim to reduce racial disparities in suicidal behavior by improving
identification, and access, and by targeting risk factors that are more prevalent among Black youth."
10703217,"Background: Musculoskeletal (MSK) pain is the leading cause of disability and reduced quality of life among
older adults. We also know that depressive symptoms frequently co-exist with MSK pain and complicate
management. Despite rising costs attributed to MSK pain and depressive symptoms, few behavioral
interventions have been developed to address these comorbid conditions in this vulnerable aging population.
Significance: The PI, during her VA HSR&D CDA2, developed and tested the feasibility of a novel behavioral
intervention targeting older Veterans with chronic back pain and depressive symptoms. MOTIVATE (Moving to
Improve Pain and Depression in Older Veterans) incorporates evidence-based components of motivational
interviewing (MI), values elicitation, goal setting and patient activation to motivate older Veterans to become
more physically active, thereby improving pain interference, function, and depressive symptoms. MOTIVATE is
delivered by a health coach via telephone or video during eight sessions over 12-weeks. Preliminary findings
from the PIâs ongoing pilot trial of MOTIVATE show it is feasible, improves step counts, pain interference, and
depressive symptoms. In response to VA HSR&D research priority areas, this application focuses on improving
access to care, augmenting resources for primary care practices â specifically in the areas of pain
management and aging, and leveraging virtual care to deliver behavioral interventions to vulnerable Veterans.
Innovation/Impact: This research is innovative because we 1) target both MSK pain and depressive
symptoms and enhance generalizability of our findings, 2) incorporate older Veteransâ motivation to change as
a key behavioral determinant, 3) use remote delivery to enhance reach of both pain and mental health services
to older Veterans; and 4) involved older Veterans and other stakeholders at every stage of development.
Specific Aims: We propose a hybrid type 1 implementation-effectiveness randomized controlled trial at two
large VA sites to establish the effectiveness and scalability of MOTIVATE. The overall goals of this study are to
1) examine the effectiveness of MOTIVATE compared to a waitlist control arm on clinical and behavioral
outcomes; 2) explore implementation processes for the MOTIVATE intervention, and 3) evaluate preliminary
cost with a budget impact analysis for MOTIVATE in older Veterans with chronic MSK pain and depressive
symptoms. We hypothesize that MOTIVATE will improve clinical and behavioral outcomes in this population.
Methodology: We will recruit older Veterans with MSK pain and depressive symptoms (n=264) to determine
effectiveness of MOTIVATE versus waitlist control arm to improve clinical and behavioral outcomes at 3
(primary endpoint) and 6 months post-enrollment. The primary outcome is pain interference (a subscale of the
Brief Pain Inventory) and secondary outcomes include depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), pain intensity, arthritis
self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing Scale, PROMIS scales (including sleep), resilience, frailty, and Global
Impression of Change. Using intent-to treat analyses, we will compare MOTIVATE and waitlist groups in terms
of primary and secondary outcomes by using a linear mixed-effects model which simultaneously models all
available measurements including baseline. Concurrently we will examine implementation processes of
delivering MOTIVATE (Aim 2). Using semi-structured interviews, we will explore the contextual factors, barriers
and facilitators to implementation and uptake of MOTIVATE, among Veterans, frontline providers, health
coaches, and facility leaders (n~50). We will use the i-PARIHS implementation framework to inform the
discussion guide. Aim 3 will provide necessary cost evaluation of MOTIVATE along with budget impact
analysis from the perspective of a VA facility to estimate the costs of implementing MOTIVATE.
Implementation/Next Steps: Results will facilitate national implementation and dissemination of MOTIVATE,
along with a hybrid type 3 trial, which can augment the care provided by primary care, mental health, and
specialty services to improve outcomes in older Veterans with comorbid MSK pain and depressive symptoms."
10658845,"Background: Womenâs health care within the VA is at a pivotal juncture. By 2040, the proportion of Veterans
who are women is expected to nearly double, from 9% (2018) to 17%. Distinct from men, women Veterans
(WV) are more racially and ethnically diverse, younger, and more likely to be single heads of households; all of
which have implications for health care engagement. The shift in age portends increasing women-specific
preventive and reproductive health care needs and a growing burden of chronic illnesses. Significance: These
shifts in the WV population require the VHA to innovate and adapt to continue to meet WV health care needs.
Virtual care will be a part of ongoing health care service changes and innovations, and has shown specific
potential for WV. However, we do not know how and when to deploy virtual care to optimize patient
engagement and clinical outcomes for WV. Addressing key areas of uncertainty in virtual VHA care
deployment for women could accelerate strategic utilization and successful implementation of virtual care for
WV, thereby improving patient satisfaction, quality of care, and health outcomes. This project addresses the
legislative priorities of the Deborah Sampson Act (H.R.2452); HSRD priorities of women's health, Virtual Care,
health equity; and ORD priorities of promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as leveraging VA
research for real-world impact. Innovation and Impact: Our proposal has four key areas of scientific
innovation, including: 1) advancing comprehensive, womenâs care delivery by completing the first synthesis of
qualitative literature around womenâs experiences with virtual care; 2) addressing key information gaps
identified by a recent VHA virtual care multi-stakeholder think tank; 3) advancing the science of qualitative
evidence synthesis through innovative incorporation of stakeholder input; and 4) bridging a methodologic gap
for translating implementation strategies into real-world actions. Specific Aims: 1) To identify barriers and
facilitators to the adoption and sustainability of appropriate virtual care delivered within comprehensive WHCs;
2) To develop an implementation blueprint for how and when to optimize adoption and sustainability of
appropriate virtual care in the context of VA comprehensive womenâs health care; and 3) To explore the impact
of the novel implementation blueprint on use of appropriate virtual care in comprehensive WHCs using a mixed
methods field test design. Methodology: For Aim 1, we will review the qualitative peer-reviewed literature on
womenâs experiences with virtual care, as well as collect primary qualitative data from marginalized women
Veteran populations (eg., Black WV, rural women) and their care providers to fill gaps in existing literature and
explore the specific VA context of synchronous virtual care for WV. For Aim 2, we will map barriers and
facilitators to relevant strategies and outcomes for implementation, and engage key multi-level stakeholders to
define actionable applications of identified strategies within comprehensive WHCs. For Aim 3, we will work with
the VA Womenâs Health Practice Based Research Network and the Office of Rural Health to identify two
comprehensive womenâs health clinics with which to conduct an evaluation of the implementation blueprint.
primary qualitative interviews and clinical providers of WV health care. Implementation: The product of this
work will be a blueprint for when and how to incorporate synchronous virtual care into comprehensive care for
WV. We will maintain close communication with our operations partners from the Office of Connected Care,
Office of Rural Health, and Womenâs Health Services throughout the proposed work and plan iteratively with
them for dissemination. Ultimately, this proposed work has the potential to improve effectiveness of, and
satisfaction with, comprehensive care for WV within the VA by delivering health care at the right time with the
right modality for the clinical situation and patient's needs."
10796875,"PROJECT SUMMARY
To date, efforts to define and apply precision endotyping has been limited to studies of adults. However,
immune development in early life (IDEAL) is dynamic and varies between individuals suggesting that
endotypes corresponding to distinct pathophysiological mechanisms will be age-dependent. We propose
therefore a novel approach in which we will study well-defined longitudinal childhood cohorts and use in silico
integrative analyses of existing and prospectively collected data coupled with age-specific human in vitro model
systems to identify agents that redirect IDEAL away from disease endotypes towards those associated with
health. We have selected three clinical endpoints to correlate with systems biology data to identify IDEAL
endotypes: a) vaccine responsiveness, as vaccines are the most important biomedical intervention to
reduce childhood disease; b) respiratory infection which represents the greatest burden of childhood
infectious disease; and c) asthma, an immune-mediated respiratory disease which manifests in
childhood and results in substantial health burden. Each of these endpoints demonstrates substantial
inter-individual variability enabling powerful systems biology tools to extract meaningful correlations. We
will harmonize and study an IDEAL Meta-Cohort (IMC) comprised of longitudinal childhood cohorts
enrolled in North America, Africa and Australasia. Our Clinical Core in Rochester, NY, is nationally
prominent in the study of childhood immune ontogeny. Project (PR) 1 will employ cutting edge, cross-
platform integrative bioinformatics tools to identify endotypes associated with clinical endpoints. PR2, will
apply epigenetic analysis tools to the same samples and translate to host immune parameters the in
silico-derived signatures. In PR3, key endotype-associated biomarkers and pathways will be dissected in
vitro to establish cause and effect and identify agents (e.g., proteins, metabolites, adjuvants, vaccines) that
may redirect IDEAL away from unfavorable endotypes and towards favorable ones. We have optimized
sample-sparing assays to enable systems biology in infants and our published preliminary data
demonstrate feasibility, robust IDEAL, and suggest distinct signatures by clinical status. Our cross-
platform validation and correlation with endotypes correlating with clinical phenotypes will identify
predictive/actionable biomarkers by i) characterizing IDEAL and microbiome in systemic/mucosal
compartments (Overall Aim 1), ii) identifying endotype-specific biomarkers (Overall Aim 2), identifying in
vitro interventions that re-direct IDEAL endotypes towards health (Overall Aim 3). Overall, we will enhance
and accelerate discovery of new approaches to predict and prevent childhood disease."
10615663,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Large-scale genetic studies have made tremendous progress identifying the heritable basis for many
neurodevelopmental, psychiatric disorders. However, connecting common genotypes to phenotypes -- and their
underlying biological mechanisms -- in the nervous system is often complicated by complex patterns of linkage
disequilibrium (LD) as well as the long-range action of genomic regulation. Common genetic variation within the
17q21.31 locus shows strong, highly pleiotropic genome-wide associations with several brain-related
phenotypes including neuroticism, PTSD, brain volume, educational attainment, as well as multiple
neurodegenerative disorders, among others. This locus, however, is among the most complex in the human
genome, as it is known to harbor at least 8 common, complex structural haplotypes, including a ~900 kb inversion
(âH2â) under positive selection and present in ~20% of Europeans. Consequently, the specific haplotypes
mediating these brain relevant trait-associations -- and the biological mechanisms through which this risk is
conferred -- remain unknown. This proposal leverages recently developed 17q21.31 haplotype-specific SNP
imputation panels to fully elucidate the âphenome-wideâ impact of these common structural haplotypes on a wide
range of neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, cognitive, and neuroimaging phenotypes. In Aim 1, we interrogate
haplotype-specific neurodevelopmental trajectories in the iPSYCH case-cohort, comprising ~90k Danish
individuals with clinical and psychiatric diagnoses from nationwide medical registers. In Aim 2, we characterize
haplotype-specific associations with neuroimaging, psychiatric symptom, and cognitive phenotypes among up
to ~500k British 40-70 year old volunteers in the UK Biobank and in the ABCD Study, a community sample of
~10k 9-11 year olds in the US. In Aim 3, we interrogate the molecular impact of haplotypes on gene expression
and coexpression patterns in human brain across development. Finally, we perform single-cell RNA-seq and
ATAC-seq on primary human neural progenitor cell lines ascertained for distinct haplotypes, enabling direct
assessment of the allelic impact on developmental cell growth, gene expression, and chromatin accessibility.
Altogether, proposed studies will characterize the âphenome-wideâ impact of common 17q21.31 complex
structural variation in the population and deconstruct the specific neurobiological mechanisms underlying these
broad associations with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric traits."
10752605,"Background: State Veterans Home nursing homes (SVHs) care for 51% of all Veterans receiving VA-funded
nursing home care. SVHs cost VA $1.2 billion yearly in per diem payments. This critical system provides care
to a population of over 20,000 vulnerable Veterans annually but has been little researched and is in urgent
need of attention. In some SVHs, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in large numbers of preventable
illnesses, hospitalizations, and even deaths. Congress, the Government Accountability Office, and the
Secretary have all called for greater VA involvement in this system that lacks a national quality improvement
infrastructure and lags behind VA on many quality measures, including falls. This proposal addresses SVHs'
need to reduce high fall ratesâ55% of residents experience at least one fall per quarterâby implementing an
effective, evidence-based program known as LOCK. In LOCK, staff (1) âLearn from bright spotsâ (focus on
evidence of positive change); (2) âObserveâ (collect data through systematic observation); (3) âCollaborate in
huddlesâ (conduct frontline staff huddles); and (4) âKeep it bite-sizeâ (limit activities to 5-15 minutes). The
program avoids reliance on existing quality improvement infrastructures, can be easily integrated into frontline
staff routines, and has demonstrated success in improving clinical outcomes, including reductions in falls.
Significance: This study provides the following. (1) Timely, evidence-based research support to improve care
for SVHs' vulnerable population of aging Veterans. (2) Explicit integration of frontline staff expertise, ensuring
interventions are practicable and successful. (3) Direct alignment with high-reliability principlesâsuch as
sensitivity to operations and deference to expertiseâhelping extend VA's high-reliability focus to SVHs.
Innovation and Impact: This study contributes the following. (1) Advances the science of how to intervene in
settings that do not have a strong, centralized quality improvement focus through rigorous investigation of how
and why an intervention works in SVHs. (2) Investigates sustainment of our interventionâthe extent to which it
becomes part of usual careâfor up to 12 months after completion of each step of our wedge-based design. (3)
Provides timely, systematic investigation of a new area for VA research, gathering information on VA
researcher-SVH partnerships to support future collaborations.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Investigate the effectiveness of the LOCK program at improving our primary outcome of
any resident fall. We will also investigate other resident clinical outcomes (mobility, medication changes,
restraint and alarm use) and work-process outcomes for staff (job satisfaction, work engagement, burnout). We
will use both primary and secondary data collection. Aim 2: Evaluate the LOCK program's implementation. We
will use the replicating effective programs framework and multi-modal implementation facilitation strategies to
implement the program. We will use mixed methods to evaluate the program's reach, adoption, and
implementation. Aim 3: Assess the extent of program sustainment. Mixed methods will enable us to examine
intervention sustainment at 3, 6, and 12 months post intervention and sustainment variability among sites.
Methodology: This is a 4-year hybrid (Type 2) effectiveness-implementation study. It uses a pragmatic
stepped-wedge randomized trial design and employs relational coordination theory and the RE-AIM framework
to guide implementation and evaluation.
Next Steps: This study (1) directly improves care for aging Veterans, (2) advances understanding of how to
intervene in settings lacking quality improvement infrastructure, and (3) contributes knowledge about
intervention sustainment. This study also addresses VA's Research Lifecycle stages of (a) scale up and
spread and (b) sustainment. Our operational partners (Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care and the National
Association of State Veterans Homes) are fully committed to using our findings to improve care across SVHs.
Findings may also help improve care in other settings (e.g., inpatient mental health and domiciliary programs)."
10843816,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Osteoporosis is a common, chronic disease with an enormous health burden. There is an urgent need for
new anabolic therapies. The long-term goal of this project is to understand genetic risk factors for osteoporosis
to identify new drug targets to reduce this massive health burden. Genome wide association studies (GWAS)
have identified hundreds of loci associated with bone mineral density (BMD). However, the causal genes at
these loci remain to be discovered. The rationale for this project is that defining causal genes at BMD loci is, at
present, a phenotype-limited problem. More specifically, most causal genes reside in the genomic regions
flanking BMD loci. Thus, each locus implicates multiple candidate genes residing in these flanking regions.
However, there are 100s of such candidate genes whose skeletal functions are unknown, and in vivo
approaches with sufficient throughput to fill this phenotype gap are virtually non-existent. There is an urgent
scientific need to understand the functions of genes at BMD loci, because they form the basis for
understanding how genetic variants influence BMD, and in turn, the ability to translate these loci into clinical
targets. The objective of this project is to leverage rapid-throughput biology in zebrafish to advance our
understanding of genes at BMD loci that influence bone mass and quality, and the mechanisms by which they
act. Our central hypothesis is that genetic variants influence BMD by regulating genes at BMD-associated loci,
which work in concert to influence bone mass and quality. In specific aim 1 (SA1), we will identify genes at
BMD loci with adult loss-of-function skeletal phenotypes in a reverse genetic screen. Our team has identified
56 BMD loci in a large-scale GWAS meta-analysis. A novel phenotyping strategy will be employed to
functionally annotate candidate genes residing within 80kb of these 56 BMD loci. Human genetic analyses will
be performed to explore how each gene identified in our screen contributes to BMD. In specific aim 2 (SA2),
we will perform a multi-level examination to determine cellular and molecular mechanisms by which genes at
7q31.31 influence bone mass and quality. SA2 will serve as a model by which new genes discovered in SA1,
and their interactions with each other, will be mechanistically evaluated. This project is innovative because it
substantially differs from the status quo for functional testing for causal genes at BMD lociâthe use of mouse
phenotyping consortiumsâand harnesses approaches developed by our team to perform one of the most
comprehensive functional analyses of genes at BMD loci to date. This project is significant because it will: 1)
establish an efficient model for exploration of human genomics underlying osteoporosis-related traits, for which
there is an urgent need; 2) identify new skeletal genes at BMD loci, a genetic territory that is enriched with
known osteoporosis drug targets, and which has proven to yield drug targets likely to be clinically viable; 3)
define mechanisms by which genes at 7q31.31 influence bone mass and quality, as a model of how different
genetic variants and their causal genes can act in concert to affect BMD."

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health problem, and advances in the basic and clinical sciences are
urgently needed to make progress towards the World Health Organizationâs End TB Strategy goal of reducing TB
deaths by 95% and new cases by 90% between 2015 and 2035. The Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Center for
Tuberculosis Research (CTR) has been a global leader in TB pathogenesis, translational models, diagnostics, drug
development, pharmacology, public health interventions, and epidemiological and economic modeling for more than
two decades. Research emanating from the CTR and JHU has transformed the treatment of TB infection and
disease, elucidated interactions between TB and HIV drugs, validated the efficacy and effectiveness of new
diagnostic tools, and contributed to the development of evidence-based policies for global TB control, based on the
epidemiology and population dynamics of TB. However, to make further progress in efforts to achieve the END TB
goals, additional innovative, cross-disciplinary and impactful research is critical and a new generation of TB
scientists must be recruited and trained, particularly among groups nationally underrepresented in health-related
research (UHRR). We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of researchers from multiple departments spanning
four JHU schools (Medicine, Public Health, Nursing and Engineering), with complementary expertise in microbial
pathogenesis, immunology, animal models, imaging, clinical trials, diagnostics, epidemiology, pharmacology and
pharmacometrics, computational modeling, and biostatistics, in order to provide added value to the TB research
enterprise at JHU optimize training opportunities for junior investigators and support for new, interdisciplinary
collaborations, with the goal of addressing key knowledge gaps in TB research. The JHU TRAC team comprises
58 researchers, including 32 experienced TB researchers (19 current members of the CTR), 15 senior researchers
new to the TB field, and 11 Early Stage Investigators (ESI). The overarching mission of the JHU TRAC is to advance
TB research by promoting innovative, multidisciplinary collaborations and by recruiting, training and supporting
junior Investigators, especially among UHRR groups, to develop the next generation of leaders in TB research. To
this end, the JHU TRAC will focus on these four areas: 1) Enhance the integration, productivity and impact of JHU
TB research; 2) Provide mentoring, support, and pilot funding for the next generation of TB researchers, and to
increase the pipeline of junior investigators from UHRR groups; 3) Support TB researchers with direct services from
a Clinical Core and three Scientific Cores; 4) Contribute to the END TB goals through global engagement, training,
outreach, and collaboration with partners in high-burden countries. The JHU TRAC is organized into six Cores
(Adminsitrative Core (AC); Developmental Core (DC); Clinical Core (CC); Microbiology, Immunology, Animal
Modeling and Imaging (MIAMI) Core; Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics Core (PPC); and Bioinformatics,
Modeling and Biostatistics Core (BMBC), which will interact closely with each other to promote synergy in TB
research, and ensure that the utility and output of the JHU TRAC is greater than the sum of its parts."

Transplantation, and Cancer Prevention and Control. Twelve SRs provide state-of-the-art-or-better support for
SKCCC research and researchers. SKCCC science encompasses discovery research into the molecular
genetics and epigenetics of human tumorigenesis, clinical trials of new immunotherapies and other cancer
treatments, and epidemiologic analyses of lifestyle influences on cancer mortality. Over the past funding
period, SKCCC Members were exceptionally productive, authoring 3,775 publications (23% Intra-
Programmatic, 22% Inter-Programmatic and 66% featuring external collaborators). SKCCC researchers
garnered $78.5 million in current peer-reviewed grant support, including $44.9 million from the National Cancer
Institute. The SKCCC continued to deliver its science to the bedside. From an average 6,374 new cancer
patients treated per year from 2016â2020, an average of 1,647 new subjects were enrolled annually to
interventional studies (26% of newly registered cancer patients); therapeutic studies accrued some 17% of
cancer patients. In addition, the SKCCC has worked successfully to promote inclusion of minority and
underserved patients with cancer in clinical research, yielding a slight increase in minority participation in
interventional trials (22.3% in 2015 to 25.4% in 2020), while African American accrual to interventional trials
remained steady (15.0% in 2015 and 15.6% in 2020). Moving forward, the SKCCC plans: (1) to promote new
breakthroughs in fundamental cancer research that create paradigm-shifting insights into the nature of human
cancers, (2) to translate this pipeline of discovery into practice-changing advances, (3) to overcome barriers
responsible for disparities in cancer outcomes by enhancing the delivery of innovative cancer services
throughout the state of Maryland catchment area, and (4) to integrate research training and career
development of biomedical scientists and health care professionals into all cancer research endeavors."

The overarching goal of this proposal, submitted in response to RFA-CA-19-035, is to evaluate if an aging-
sensitive survivorship intervention improves outcomes valued by older adults and their caregivers
during the transition into survivorship from curative-intent chemotherapy. This proposal is important
because by 2040, 73% of survivors will be aged 65+ and almost 50% will be aged 75+. Unfortunately, aging-
related conditions (e.g., physical and cognitive function impairments) are not addressed routinely in survivorship
care. Preliminary research by all multiple principal investigators (MPIs: Mohile, Janelsins, Mustian) suggests that
a Geriatric Evaluation and Management (GEM) intervention is effective for surveilling, triaging and managing
physical and cognitive impairments, improving patient and caregiver satisfaction, and fostering communication
about aging-related conditions during chemotherapy in older cancer patients and their caregivers. Preliminary
research by MPIs also suggests that a Survivorship Health Promotion program is effective for improving physical
function among older survivors after chemotherapy. Our MPI team has shown that GEM and Survivorship Health
Promotion are feasible to implement in older patients, survivors and caregivers in nationwide samples recruited
via the University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP)
Research Base network. To fill existing empirical gaps in survivorship care for older survivors and caregivers,
we created a novel intervention called Survivorship-GEM by combining these two very promising and synergistic
programs. Survivorship-GEM is directed by oncology advanced practice providers (APPs), because they
routinely direct care for survivors in the community. We propose to conduct a two-arm cluster randomized trial
comparing the efficacy of our novel Survivorship-GEM intervention to usual care for improving physical and
cognitive function, satisfaction with care, completion of referral appointments, and hospitalizations among older
survivors. We will also examine the effect of Survivorship-GEM on oncology APP communication with primary
care providers and on caregiver distress and satisfaction with care. We will randomize 30 NCORP community
oncology practices to two arms: 1) Survivorship-GEM or 2) usual care. Survivors aged 65+ (n=720) and
caregivers (if available, estimated n=500) will complete baseline assessments at the end of curative-intent
chemotherapy for a solid tumor malignancy with follow-ups at 6 and 12 months. Our uniquely qualified,
multidisciplinary team includes expertise in geriatrics, clinical trials, nursing, primary care, behavioral oncology,
rehabilitation, health disparities, biostatistics, and implementation science. The team also benefits from
collaborations with the Cancer and Aging Research Group Advisory Board and the SCOREboard patient
advocate group. The APP-directed Survivorship-GEM intervention is highly innovative and has tremendous
potential to improve outcomes in older survivors and caregivers by surveilling, triaging and managing the effects
of chemotherapy and by fostering health promotion."

MULTIVALENT TICK-MICROBE TARGETED LYME DISEASE VACCINES
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Lyme disease remains a prevalent tick-borne infection in many parts of the world. In the United States alone,
there are over 300,000 new cases occurring each year. The infection is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu
lato, which is a group of atypical extracellular bacterial pathogens that survive in nature through a complex
enzootic infection cycle involving ticks (belonging to the Ixodes scapularis complex) and an array of vertebrate
hosts, most commonly wild rodents. Despite serious efforts to control the infection over the past several
decades, the disease is still emerging around the globe, largely due to the absence of effective control
measures against tick infestation, lack of human vaccines, difficulties in diagnosis, and clinical complications
associated with treatments which use currently available antimicrobials. Specifically, several months after
standard-care antibiotic therapy, a subset of patients can experience a series of persistent or relapsing
symptoms, known as chronic Lyme disease or post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, for which further
treatment options remain unavailable. Therefore, the development of vaccines is highly warranted to
combat Lyme disease. This project pursues our goals to develop a novel vaccination campaign that
comprises selected antigens from both the Lyme disease pathogen and the tick vector, expressed from a well-
established viral vector system. The approach incorporates a set of novel vaccine targets that are expressed
on the microbial surface or towards the luminal surface of the tick gut. As highlighted in recently-published and
preliminary data, immunization with these targets generates protective immunity in mammals. We will
utilize highly efficient Rabies virus-based vaccine systems (RABV), which have broad applications as
competent vaccine platforms for many infectious diseases and display remarkable safety profiles, as
evidenced from their current use for human vaccination. The overall objective is embodied in three specific
aims: 1) construction of a battery of recombinant replication-competent, replication-deficient RABVs
and virions expressing B. burgdorferi and tick antigens, 2) characterization of vaccine constructs for
long-term immunogenicity in murine models, and 3) identification of the most effective vaccine
candidate(s) that modulate B. burgdorferi infection and generate protective immunity. We will also
perform studies for understanding the mechanisms of the humoral and cellular immune responses associated
with host protection. Overall, these studies will facilitate the design of safer, next generation vaccines to
prevent the incidence of Lyme borreliosis. Moreover, the same approach may serve as a paradigm for
combating other tick-borne infections.

10606546,"Our overall aim is to develop a precision-based nanotheranostic platform where the imaging signal may
serve as an early predictive imaging biomarker for intracellular nanoparticle accumulation and therapeutic
response. New anti-cancer agents continue to be developed, but many fail due to the tumor developing (multi-)
drug resistance. Cellular membrane proteins acting as a drug efflux pump have been identified, and while
some promising agents enter tumor cells, they cannot always be retained long enough to be effective. We aim
to exploit the enzyme legumain (an asparaginyl endopeptidase) that is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells
for specific cleavage of an olsalazine (Olsa)-conjugated peptide substrate, following which the substrate self-
assembles into intracellular nanoparticles. This enzyme-driven self-assembly serves several purposes: 1)
intracellular entrapment with minimal drug efflux; 2) prolonged tumor drug exposure; and 3) minimal toxicity to
normal organs due to rapid blood clearance of non-assembled single molecules. We have preliminary data
demonstrating this concept to be feasible in vivo. Since it does not only serve as an anti-cancer drug through
inhibition of DNA methylation, but also as a non-metallic, label-free contrast agent for chemical exchange
saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging (CEST MRI), olsalazine is a unique theranostic agent. The
drug can be visualized without modification, allowing direct imaging without pharmacological alterations that
may affect self-assembly and/or biodistribution. Following in vitro selection of an optimal Olsa-CBT-800CW-Rn-
AAN substrate with maximum tumor cell penetration and retention in legumain-overexpressing DU145 cells
(Aim 1), we will test this compound for its in vivo nanotheranostic properties in an orthotopic mouse prostate
tumor model (Aim 2) and a transgenic mouse model (TRAMP mouse) where normal prostate cells undergo a
malignant transformation over time (Aim 3). If successful, this approach may be extended to other enzyme-
targeted CEST MRI-detectable theranostic platforms for imaging tumor aggressiveness, drug accumulation,
and predicting therapeutic response."
10806923,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) and spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) allow noninvasive study
of brain chemistry. However, subject motion remains a major obstacle in MRS, especially in motion-prone
populations such as children, the elderly, and patients with movement disorders. Motion results in inaccurate
localization and degrades MRS spectral quality. Most of these effects cannot be corrected retroactively, and
must be corrected prospectively (i.e. in real-time). In the brain, existing prospective motion-corrected MRS
sequences are currently limited to a handful of research centers and are not widely used. In the spinal cord,
prospective motion and shim correction has not been reported. The main objective of this application is to
develop fully automated, high performance, motion-corrected MRS sequences for the brain and spinal cord, that
are also easy to share (no additional external hardware needed) with other institutions and easy to use. Our
specific aims are as follows. In Aim 1A, we will develop improved brain navigators that are faster and less
sensitivity to B0 inhomogeneities, and will allow adjustment of 2nd order shims in the MRS voxel at 3T and 7T. In
Aim 1B, we will develop prospective motion correction in the spinal cord at 3T and 7T. In Aim 2, we will fully
automate the sequence workflow to allow âpush-buttonâ acquisition of reproducible, high quality MRS data, even
by non-MRS experts. In Aim 3, we will assess the performance of techniques developed in Aims 1 and 2 in real-
life conditions in healthy volunteers (children, young and elderly adults) and in children with
mucopolysaccharidosis type I, adrenoleukodystrophy and Friedreich ataxia. We will initially develop these new
techniques on Siemens scanners, with the goal of translating them to other manufacturers in the next funding
period. We expect that âpush-buttonâ data acquisition together with prospective motion correction will remove
remaining obstacles for acquisition of MRS data with consistently high quality. Both improving spectral quality
as a whole and decreasing the variability in spectral quality are key for reliable MRS measurements. With
improved reliability and ease of use, the full potential of brain and spinal cord MRS will be widely available for
upcoming clinical studies and gene therapy trials."
10842286,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Overall)
The proposed âCenter for Team Effectiveness to Accelerate EBP Implementation in Childrenâs Mental Health Services (TEAMS)â will leverage organizational team effectiveness research (TER) to develop and test novel team-based implementation strategies, methods, and tools to improve the reach, quality, and effectiveness of care delivered in public systems serving children with mental health needs - specialty mental health, schools, pediatric healthcare, and child welfare. Gaps between evidence-based practices (EBPs) and routine care persist and limit the quality and effectiveness of services for children. High performing implementation teams are essential to effective services and team-level mechanisms can hinder or facilitate EBP implementation. There is substantial research on team development interventions developed for the military, business, and other complex contexts, but they not been leveraged to improve childrenâs mental health. The TEAMS Center will create the essential administrative and scientific infrastructure to conduct team-based implementation research to improve childrenâs mental health outcomes. It will bring together experts in childrenâs mental health implementation research, EBPs for children and adolescents, implementation strategies, models, and methods, TER, and computer science. We propose to: (1) establish a highly efficient and well-functioning Center for community-partnered childrenâs mental health implementation research; (2) integrate TER and natural language processing to advance implementation science models, designs, and measures; and (3) leverage the Centerâs expertise and infrastructure to design, build, and test team-based strategies to improve the implementation and effectiveness of EBPs across service systems. The Administrative Core will apply TER strategies to Center operations to optimize communication and decision-making; foster interdisciplinary collaboration and partnership with community stakeholders; and promote the development of internal and external trainees. The Methods Core will advance implementation science models to incorporate TER and natural language processing, adapt and develop measures to examine team-based implementation strategies and mechanisms, and clinical/service outcomes. Center research will adapt and test team development interventions selected from those with evidence in other contexts. The Signature R01 will test a combination of team development interventions [e.g., communication training via handoff protocols, team performance monitoring] to improve implementation and effectiveness of the Collaborative Life Skills Program for children with ADHD in schools. The developmental projects will test after-action reviews to improve shared decision making regarding mental health services in child and family teams in Child Welfare Services (R34#1); implementation team charters to improve distance training for two autism EBPs in specialty mental health and schools (R34#2); and team communication training to facilitate depression screening in a pediatric health care system (R34#3). Additionally, the Center will solicit and fund two pilot projects per year led by internal and external teams of investigators and community partners."

The Healing Lodge of the Seven Nations (HL) is a Native American youth residential addiction treatment center.
Youth come to HL from tribal communities including, but not limited to, the Coeur dâAlene Tribe, the Kootenai
Tribe, the Nez Perce Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, the Kalispel Tribe of Indians,
the Spokane Tribe of Indians, and the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation. Recognizing the lack of
programmatic research regarding best practices for supporting adolescentsâ recovery within tribal nations, HL
has developed a research partnership with the Division on Addiction, Cambridge Health Alliance, a Harvard
Medical School teaching hospital. This partnership is the Center for Indigenous Research, Collaboration,
Learning, and Excellence (CIRCLE). As part of CIRCLEâs NARCH VIII program, Promoting Cultures of Recovery
in Tribal Communities, we worked with and learned from these seven tribal nations about how communities seek
to support their youth in recovery from substance use disorders. Accordingly, CIRCLEâs NARCH X program,
Building Cultures of Recovery in Tribal Communities, was a logical extension of this work. We used a Tribal
Participatory Program Development approach to build a mental health first response system grounded in
indigenous values, strengths, and needs called, xaÊtus (pronounced hah-toosÍ¾ i.e., First Face) for Mental Health.
Now, CIRCLEâs proposed NARCH XII program, Assessing Cultures of Recovery in Tribal Communities, seeks
support for an Administration Core, Research Core, Capacity Building Core, and two Pilot Projects that will
support advanced development and insight into xaÊtus for Mental Health, and unique understandings of tribal
youth in recovery. More specifically, in the Research Core, we will complete community surveys and a large
multi-wave randomized waitlist assessment of xaÊtus for Mental Health. The Capacity Building Core will use
project-based educational experiences to help AI/AN students gain research experience and HL develop its own
research and training unit, while also providing xaÊtus for Mental Health training and evaluation at HL. The Pilot
Projects will use survey research methods to obtain essential information from tribal youth and adults about ideal
intervention points for youth in recovery and perceived barriers to using xaÊtus for Mental Health. In addition to
the many scientific knowledge gains of the research studies, the proposed set of activities will have an immediate
public health impact, through the training of hundreds of tribal community members in mental health knowledge
and situational awareness."

10650290,"SUMMARY
The over-arching goal of this proposal is to delineate the signaling networks mediating the instructive role of the
myofiber on MuSC function. MuSC, also known as satellite cells, are the main source of skeletal muscle growth
and regeneration. In healthy adult tissues MuSC exist in a quiescent state, and upon stress or injury they are
activated to proliferate and generate large numbers of progenitors to efficiently repair damaged muscles. While
this process is efficient in healthy conditions, in several diseased conditions and during aging the numbers and
function of MuSC are impaired. Thus, there is a major need to understand the molecular networks regulating
their function, in order to identify novel tools or targets to enhance their tissue repair potential that can be utilized
in regenerative medicine approaches. Significant efforts in the recent years have defined a critical role of the
microenvironment in regulating MuSC function, by uncovering the integrated coordination of several tissue-
resident cells, such as inflammatory cells, fibroadipogenic progenitors and endothelial cells in regulating MuSC
tissue repair function. However, the role of the myofiber within the tissue microenvironment and in the MuSC
niche is still poorly defined. Our preliminary findings provide evidence that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Fbxw7 in
myofibers regulates MuSC pool size in a cell non-autonomous manner, suggesting that the myofiber plays a
major role in instructing stem cell function. We further identify PGC1alpha as a direct Fbxw7 target and the
upregulation of the PGC1alpha target irisin, a myokine that promotes MuSC differentiation. The identification of
signaling pathways that mediate the instructive role of the myofiber on MuSC pool size could identify strategies
to expand MuSC, thus allowing their use in regenerative medicine approaches. The objective of this application
is to take advantage of genetic models, unbiased proteomics and ubiquitinome profiling, gene expression
profiling and cellular biology techniques in order to delineate the signaling networks mediating the instructive role
of the myofiber on MuSC function. The central hypothesis to be tested is that the Fbxw7 in myofibers regulates
MuSC numbers in a cell non-autonomous manner by altering the MuSC niche. This integrated approach will
improve our understanding of myofiber/MuSC interactions, define the signaling networks mediating this process
and evaluate Fbxw7/PGC1Î±/Irisin as a critical axis to regulate MuSC pool size."

Adolescence is a developmental period when oral diseases often arise and a time during which dental
care is the most common unmet health care need. Approximately one-fifth of U.S. adolescents have
untreated dental caries in their permanent teeth, and they use fewer dental services compared with
younger children. Adolescence is also a developmental period during which they are strongly
influenced by the peers in their social network, which is a personâs network of in-person social
interactions and interpersonal relationships. Outside of oral health, research on social networks have
been instrumental in advancing our understanding of obesity, smoking, HIV/AIDS and drug addiction.
Far less is known about the effects of social networks on oral health; and there is no existing literature
on the association between social networks and oral health outcomes in adolescents. This study will
examine the extent to which adolescent social networks are predictive of dental utilization. We will use
the largest, most comprehensive longitudinal survey of adolescents in the U.S., which is the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, 1994-2018 (Add Health). Add Health collected peer
network data from 90,118 public school students aged 10 to 19 years from 145 schools in Wave I
(1994-1995) and completed 4 additional Waves of data collection through 2018. A whole peer network
can be constructed from this dataset, which allows us to study the relationship between social network
characteristics and dental utilization cross-sectionally in the same year and longitudinally as the cohort
transitioned to adulthood. We will use multiple regression controlling for individual, family, community,
and social network characteristics with peer- and school-level random effects to examine the extent to
which adolescent social networks are predictive of dental utilization. This proposal addresses the
NIDCRâs strategic vision 2030 on Oral Health + Overall Health, which prioritizes longitudinal cohort
studies of oral health across the lifespan. The overall impact of this research will increase our
understanding of the relationship between social networks and oral health outcomes, apply rigorous
social network analytic methods to dental health research, and inform novel approaches to
interventions that improve dental utilization in an age range that has persistent untreated dental caries."

Over 250,000 women in the United States are living with HIV, but limited research has addressed the physical
and mental health outcomes among younger women living with HIV (WLHIV). Because health status in the
reproductive years and surrounding pregnancy critically affects lifelong health, understanding health outcomes
among young WLHIV of reproductive age before, during, and after pregnancy is of substantial public health
importance in the US and worldwide. The maternal outcomes of WLHIV are inextricably linked to the long-term
health and survival of their children. The Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS), conducted at 21 sites across
the US and Puerto Rico, has been following young WLHIV of reproductive age and their children since 2007,
with over 2000 birth mothers and >2800 HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) children. Mothers with perinatally
acquired HIV (PHIV) are of specific interest, and the PHACS network includes >400 such women with PHIV
(WPHIV) along with their 251 HEU children. Utilizing the successful and longstanding PHACS research
infrastructure and existing cohorts, we will establish the Health Outcomes around Pregnancy and Exposure
to HIV/Antiretrovirals (HOPE) cohort, a cohort of 2000 pregnant, non-pregnant or nulliparous WLHIV of
reproductive age from geographically diverse, high HIV prevalence areas. Leveraging PHACS, cost-effective
and targeted enrollment and follow-up for longitudinal data collection will be achieved; we will also establish a
rich biorepository which links WLHIV to their childrenâs data and biospecimens. Thus, the HOPE research
platform will support high impact scientific studies central to the health of young WLHIV.
Our scientific aims for the HOPE cohort are: (1) to evaluate the effects of HIV-related disease and treatment
factors on reproductive health, non-communicable diseases, and oral health of WLHIV as well as psychosocial
determinants of these health outcomes (engagement in care, mental health diagnoses, racism, inequity and
stigma, disclosure of HIV, and substance use/misuse), and (2) To assess child health outcomes and their impact
on the health of WLHIV, including maternal HIV disease progression, antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence,
engagement in care and maternal mental health. Overall, HOPE will create a platform to explore the multilevel
determinants and mechanisms that influence the short and longer-term health of WLHIV during their reproductive
years, as well as the health of their children, and will serve as a resource for future multidisciplinary studies in
areas such as genetics and epigenetics, microbiome/virome/proteomes and immune activation, to provide better
understanding of potential inflammatory and epigenetic processes associated with these outcomes."
10595012,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a highly prevalent vascular disease entailing high morbidity and mortality
risks. But, PAD is underdiagnosed with low primary care awareness. Conventional PAD diagnosis in clinical
settings is not suited to low-cost, high-throughput, and accurate PAD diagnosis. Noting that PAD alters arterial
pulse waveforms, the analysis of arterial pulse waveforms (called the pulse waveform analysis (PWA)) has the
potential for advancing the accuracy and convenience of PAD diagnosis. In particular, PWA can outperform
techniques built upon discrete features in the arterial pulse waveforms (e.g., ABI) by exploiting the arterial
pulse waveforms in their entirety. In addition, PWA can be realized with arterial pulse waveforms conveniently
measured at the extremity sites (e.g., arm and ankle, which are already being employed in ABI). Yet, PWA
involves trial-and-error-based empirical feature selection. Hence, PWA may be combined with modern deep
learning (DL) techniques to leverage the ability of DL to automatically select task-relevant features.
 Successful training of a DL algorithm for PAD diagnosis requires massive labeled datasets associated
with longitudinal PAD progression collected from diverse PAD patients. However, only scarce (and possibly
non-longitudinal) datasets from a small number of patients may be available in reality. Now that arterial pulse
waveform is affected not only by PAD but also by the anatomical and arterial biomechanical characteristics of
the patient, insufficiency in datasets can deteriorate the robustness of the DL algorithm against disturbances
due to a wide range of anatomical and arterial biomechanical characteristics encountered in real-world PAD
patients obscuring the signatures of PAD in the arterial pulse waveforms. To address these obstacles, we
propose to realize a DL-enabled arterial PWA approach to PAD diagnosis by developing a novel computational
method for robust training of DL algorithms with scarce datasets. Our basic idea is to extend the conventional
domain-adversarial learning to guide DL training so as to foster the exploitation of latent features independent
of continuous anatomical and arterial biomechanical disturbances in diagnosing PAD. Specific aims include: (i)
to develop a continuous domain-adversarial regularization (CDAR) method for robust DL algorithm training with
scarce datasets; and (ii) to demonstrate the potential of the DL-enabled arterial PWA developed with the aid of
CDAR for detecting, localizing, and assessing the severity of PAD robustly against disturbances associated
with patient height and arterial stiffness in a resource-efficient in silico study. We will also estimate the amount
of datasets required to enable accurate and robust PAD diagnosis to inform our follow-up in vivo study. If
successful, the CDAR method and the DL-enabled PWA may be broadly applicable to the diagnosis of a range
of cardiovascular diseases. The success of this project will provide us with a strong justification for resource-
intensive in vivo assessment of the DL-enabled PWA approach to PAD diagnosis using datasets collected from
real PAD patients based on the sample size informed by the results of this project."

researchers. Over the past three decades the University of Utah School of Medicine (UUSOM), which includes
the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences and the Moran Eye Center, has built a dynamic
research community that addresses the full range of eye-related health issues. Faculty membersâ grant-funded
research spans the continuum of T1-T4 translational science and is supported by numerous institutional
programs. A large number of our medical students are interested in eye health, as evidenced by 29% regularly
participating in monthly meetings of the medical student-run Ophthalmology Interest Group. In addition, faculty
members have extensive experience in successfully mentoring trainees, helping to build the physician-scientist,
and scientifically minded physician, workforce. Thus, the UUSOM is an ideal location to offer outstanding short-
term research experiences for medical students. The goal and objectives of the Medical Student Research
Program in Eye Health and Disease (MSRP-EHD) are to: GOAL: Ignite in medical students a life-long interest
in conducting or collaborating in the translational field of vision research, while also building their skills in
creative and critical thinking. Objective 1: Expose 5 medical students/year to EHD-associated research
opportunities spanning the translational research spectrum (T0 to T4). Trainees will participate in a mentored,
10-week summer research experience between their first and second years of medical school and develop
creative and critical thinking skills through an innovative summer course. Objective 2: Engage in the exciting
foundational, clinical. and translational science discoveries taking place at the University of Utah. Sixteen
faculty mentors have agreed to participate in the program. The PI/PD will be advised by an internal Steering
Committee of NEI-funded investigators, SOM Curriculum Committee members, and external T35 program
leaders. Multiple evaluation strategies will be used to provide formative feedback for program improvement as
well as tracking studentsâ career trajectories."
11100866,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a highly lethal human malignancy, typically diagnosed at an
advanced stage and known to be largely unresponsive to chemotherapy and ionizing radiation. Recent genomic
characterization of PDA reveals that between 20-25 % of PDA harbor recurrent mutations in genes, including
BRCA1/2, PALB2, and ATM, which are critical for homologous recombination (HR), an important form of DNA
repair. In many patients, these may be germline mutations. This subgroup of PDAs, termed HR-deficient PDA,
has emerged as a defined biological entity associated with increased chemoresistance and a more aggressive
disease course.
 The defects in HR observed in these tumors impart cells with a specific vulnerability to PARP inhibitors and
platinum-containing therapy. Still, as observed in the case of many other targeted therapies, only a fraction of
HR-defective patient tumors respond to PARP inhibition. More so, many patients that initially respond
eventually often develop resistance and progress. Therefore, novel therapies which can be effective against HR-
defective PDA, alone or in combination with PARP inhibitors or other combinatorial regimens, are urgently
needed.
 We have recently determined that inactivation of the HR pathway is associated with overexpression of
polymerase theta (PolÆ, also known as POLQ) in PDA. POLQ is a key enzyme that regulates an alternative
pathway of DNA repair, known as the alternative non-homologous end-joining (Alt-NHEJ) pathway. Data from
our group indicates that in the setting of defective HR, Alt-NHEJ becomes a critical pathway responsible for the
repair of DNA breaks. Furthermore, we show that POLQ inhibition in HR-defective tumor cells demonstrates a
synthetic lethality phenotype, not observed in cells with intact HR. In this proposal, we present exciting new data
that knockdown of POLQ is synthetically lethal in PDA cells deficient for Brca1, Brca2, Atm, and Palb2 genes.
POLQ knockdown significantly inhibited growth of both Brca2- and Atm-deficient tumors cells in vivo. Further,
POLQ knockdown significantly upregulated the cGAS-STING pathway in HR-deficient PDA and promoted T cell
infiltration.
 Here, we plan to examine the unique role of POLQ in pancreatic cancer biology and its role as a novel
therapeutic target in HR-defective pancreatic cancers. We will also evaluate the antitumor effect of combining
POLQ inhibition with: i) current standard cytotoxic chemotherapies, ii) PARP inhibition, and iii)
immunotherapy. An important goal of this proposal is to generate a set of data for proof-of-concept that
targeting POLQ in a valuable therapeutic strategy in HR-defective pancreatic cancer, as POLQ inhibitors are
currently in development for clinical use."

 High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most lethal gynecological malignancy. More than 80% of
HGSOC patients recur after frontline standard therapy, and complete and durable responses are rare. Therapies
that improve compete tumor regression and prevent relapse are needed. Our GOALS are to i) identify which
ovarian cancer genetic subsets will benefit from a new more effective genetically targeted therapy using primary
tumor cultures, patient-derived xenograft models and human tumor samples from our clinical trial, ii) identify
mechanisms of acquired resistance with genetic validation.
 We have identified a novel and highly active genotoxic therapy by co-inhibiting poly-ADP ribose polymerase
(PARP) and ATR checkpoint kinase. Combination PARP inhibition with ATR inhibition (PARPi-ATRi) synergizes
to specifically target and kill HGSOCs harboring common HGSOC-associated alterations, e.g. homologous
recombination (HR) deficiency and Cyclin E overexpression. Our preliminary studies show that PARPi-ATRi in
combination is especially effective in killing HGSOC cells with these alterations and causes regression of HR-
deficient and Cyclin E overexpressing HGSOC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). These results have stimulated
a clinical trial of PARPi-ATRi combination in recurrent HGSOC (unselected patient population) to be led by the
PI of this proposal. This will be the first trial evaluating PAPRi-ATRi combination in ovarian cancer.
 Here, we propose to validate in vitro findings and expand the use of our PDX model, a reliable HGSOC
surrogate, to test the effectiveness of this novel PARPi-ATRi combination in killing HGSOCs that either
overexpress Cyclin E-or have acquired PARPi-resistance, which together cause most deaths from HGSOC. Our
clinical trial of PARPi-ATRi for treatment of recurrent HGSOC will be performed in parallel with the expanded
preclinical mouse studies. This will allow us to correlate predictive biomarkers (HR-deficiency and Cyclin E
overexpression) of response and potential resistance mechanisms (e.g., BRCA reversion mutations).
 This PARPi-ATRi combination therapy is promising; however, this treatment causes tumor regression initially
in chemo-resistant Cyclin E-overexpressing tumors but acquired resistance ultimately develops. Using genomic
and proteomics, we will integrate alterations discovered in the PAPRi-ATRi-resistant and sensitive PDXs with
patient samples from the clinical trial to develop a candidate pool list. Candidate genes associated with resistance
will be refined by prioritizing alterations found at both the gene and protein level and that are druggable. The top
candidates will be validated in vitro using a targeted CRISPR knock-down approach. Defining markers of
response and resistance will help stratify patient populations, optimize treatment strategies and identify new
targets for future therapeutics based on HGSOC cancer genetics."
10646191,"Project Summary/Abstract
A growing number of epidemiological studies link childhood asthma with maternal environmental exposures
with the strongest evidence provided for diesel exhaust and cigarette smoke. How maternal exposures lead to
asthma in offspring is unknown. To address this, we developed a mouse model of asthma susceptibility in pups
by exposing their mothers to diesel exhaust particles (DEP). Our data suggests that in this DEP-driven model,
asthma-predisposing information is transmitted in part by a subset of offspring long-term hematopoietic stem
cells (LT-HSCs), in the form of a stem cell memory. This subset distinguishes itself by expression of the IL3
receptor and is programmed for enhanced generation of basophils by the synergistic action of DEP-induced
IL1b and IL3. One key mechanism of the synergism between IL1b and IL3 is the ability of IL1b to increase
stem cell sensitivity to IL3 which is in part due to IL1b-mediated upregulation of IL3R b chain. In addition to
expanding the basophil lineage, IL3 and IL1b are likely to enhance its capacity to promote asthma. Previous
studies show that IL1b potentiates basophil histamine release and IL3 potently stimulates their IL4 production,
sowing the seed for type-2 immune response. Consistent with this, in DEP offspring, basophils overexpress
IL4. The IL3/IL1b-primed, expanded, IL4-overexpressing basophil population becomes a key driver of the type-
2 immune response and asthma upon allergen challenge. Basophil depletion in DEP pups prevents generation
of allergen-specific IgE and development of asthma. This is in contrast with data obtained in plain allergen-
based models in which basophils are redundant for production of IgE and asthma. Our overarching hypothesis
is that maternal exposure to DEP induces asthma susceptibility in offspring through IL1b and IL3 driven
programming of the hematopoietic stem cell-basophil axis. In Aim 1, by performing stem cell transplantation
experiments, we will establish links between DEP IL3R+ LT-HSCs, increased basopoiesis and predisposition to
asthma. We will define molecular basis of DEP IL3R+ LT-HSC programming by analyzing their transcriptomes
(RNA-seq) and chromatin remodeling at gene regulatory sites (ATAC-seq). In Aim 2 we will study importance
of IL1b and IL3 in programming of the HSC-basophil axis for asthma induction. In our model, IL1b and IL3 are
increased in offspring and maternal tissues, including maternal serum. We propose that maternal IL1b and IL3
are important at early stages of embryonic hematopoiesis, when HSCs undergo their initial divisions and
embryonic sources of IL1b and IL3 are scarce. Offspring-derived IL1b and IL3 complete the HSC programming
process, sustain basopoiesis at a high level, and contribute to basophil activation after maternal cytokines fade
away. To define how maternal IL1b and IL3 are transferred to embryos, study their roles and roles of offspring-
encoded IL1b and IL3, we will perform serum transfers, injections with radiolabeled cytokines, and combine
IL1b or IL3 KO strategies with embryo transfers. In Aim 3 we will use human blood samples to study IL1b and
IL3 guided basophil development in childhood asthma."
10829435,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Over 100 million surgical procedures are performed in the United States each year, with up to 80% of patients
experiencing postoperative pain. Higher levels of pain after surgery are associated with the development
chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP) and chronic opioid use, feeding into a pain epidemic that has a greater
annual societal cost than that for cancer, heart disease, and diabetes combined. Though there have been
multiple phenotypic and environmental factors that have been identified to be predisposing for the development
of CPSP, much less data is available regarding genetic predictors of CPSP. Previous studies have been
limited by small samples or candidate-gene approaches that are often not reproducible in different cohorts. It
therefore remains difficult to predict patients genetically predisposed to severe postoperative pain or those who
will progress to develop CPSP, and to tailor antinociceptive therapy to a patientâs specific genetic
predisposition to the development of pain.
The goal of the proposed work is to overcome these limitations by using the largest and most well genotyped
cohort employed thus far in the study of postsurgical pain genetics. Over 3400 patients with both
pre/postsurgical self-reported pain and genomic sequencing data will make up this cohort. We hypothesize that
1) identifiable variations in genes and genetic pathways are associated with postsurgical pain, and 2) these
variations can contribute to differing responses to pharmacologic therapy. This study will use candidate gene,
genome-wide association study, and pathway-based analyses to identify genetic variations that influence
postsurgical pain. I will then leverage one of the most granular clinical trials of low back pain (NIH HEAL
BACPAC) to study genetic associations of responsiveness for a common pain medication (duloxetine).
The candidate for this mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award aims to complement his
previous training with additional expertise in large-scale genomics, biostatistics, and clinical trial design. In
order to facilitate future collaboration with colleagues across multiple disciplines, in concert with the proposed
study the candidate with also pursue didactive and experiential translational science training related to his
research aims. The University of Michigan has committed abundant resources to support this proposal, and it
is also supported by a multidisciplinary mentorship group comprised of authorities in genetics, genomics,
biostatistics, perioperative pain, and clinical trial design and execution. The proposed studies will provide novel
insights into the genetics of chronic postoperative pain and form the basis for future studies into personalized
pain therapy."
10844071,"There is a critical need for new protein crystallization methods that require less labor, time, and resources. Pre-
viously, crystals of 10 out of 11 target proteins were readily generated by fusing them to TELSAM, a polymer-
forming crystallization chaperone. There is great need for continued investigation of TELSAM due to its potential
as a general-use protein crystallization chaperone. Lack of straightforward methods to successfully crystallize
any protein of interest significantly hinders study of molecular disease mechanisms and the development of
effective treatments. The lack of effective treatments for many diseases forces them to be addressed instead
with costly symptom management programs. The long-term goal of this project is to develop protein crystalliza-
tion methods that can result in well-ordered protein crystals on a time scale of less than a month, cost as little as
$1000 per structure, and are successful for greater than 70% of proteins of interest. The overall objective of this
proposal is to convincingly demonstrate the benefits of using TELSAM as a protein crystallization chaperone and
to clearly define the requirements for doing so. The central hypothesis is that TELSAM will accelerate the speed
and success rate of crystallization across a wide range of proteins of interest and that flexible fusion of target
proteins to the 1TEL variant will be optimal. The rationale is that TELSAM has shown great promise in preliminary
studies and has the potential to 1) decrease the cost of determining an atomic-scale protein structure, 2) accel-
erate the rate that protein structures can be determined, and 3) increase the success rate of crystallization,
expanding the range of proteins that can be structurally characterized in this way. The central hypothesis will be
tested, and the overall objective achieved by executing 2 specific aims: 1) Compare the ease of obtaining well-
ordered crystals across a range of proteins of interest with and without fusion to TELSAM. 2) Establish best
practices for successfully using TELSAM. In Aim 1, a panel of target proteins or protein complexes of varying
sizes will be crystallized alone or as flexible fusions to TELSAM. In Aim 2, selected target proteins will be flexibly
or rigidly fused to TELSAM with varying degrees of target protein loading along the polymer. Longer linker lengths
and unusually low protein concentrations in crystallization experiments will also be investigated. The proposed
research is innovative, in the applicantâs opinion, because it proposes: 1) Systematic investigation of the factors
required by TELSAM-target fusions to reliably form well-ordered crystals, 2) Investigation of 1TEL, which pre-
sents 6 copies of the target protein per turn of the TELSAM polymer and precludes any direct inter-TELSAM
contacts, 3) Investigation of semi-rigid fusions of target proteins to TELSAM, 4) Testing the limits of TELSAM-
mediated protein crystallization with target protein complexes and ligand-bound targets. The proposed research
is significant because it will enable the successful crystallization and structure determination of a greater number
and variety of biotechnology and disease-relevant proteins, ultimately leading to new biotechnology tools, more
effective disease treatments, and reduced healthcare costs."
10709523,"Parkinsonâs disease (PD), an intractable condition impairing motor and cognitive function, is imperfectly treated
by drugs and surgery. Two priority issues for a majority of people with PD are OFF-time and Cognitive
impairment. Even under best medical management, 74% of people with PD experience âOFF-timeâ related to
medication-related motor fluctuations, which severely impacts both quality of life and cognition 1. Cognitive
deficits are found even in newly diagnosed people with PD and are very difficult to treat 2. However, our strong
preliminary data demonstrate that partnered dance-aerobic exercise reduces OFF-time (Cohens standardized
d=1.09), on the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale-IV, MDS-UPDRS-IV) and
ameliorates other disease features 5-8, with retention of benefits for at least one month post-PDAE. These data
motivate this proposal. PDAE provides AE during an improvisational, cognitively-engaging rehabilitative physical
activity. Cognitive engagement is a critical component of PDAE, which has benefitted spatial cognition (d=.76).
Consistent with these findings, we have strong preliminary evidence, obtained via functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI), that biweekly PDAE training increases activity in brain regions implicated in cognition. Although
exercise benefits motor and cognitive symptoms and may be neuroprotective for PD, 3,4 studies using robust
biomarkers of neuroprotection in humans are quite rare. We propose to perform a randomized, controlled trial in
veterans and non-veterans with diagnosed PD to compare the efficacy of PDAE versus walking AE (WAE) for
OFF-time, cognition, and neuroprotection. Importantly, we will assess neuroprotection with novel neuromelanin-
sensitive MRI (NM-MRI) and iron-sensitive (R2*) MRI sequences to quantify neuromelanin loss and iron
accumulation in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) 3,8 9. We will use these biomarkers, neuromelanin loss
and iron accumulation, as tools to chart the course of neurodegeneration in patients with PD who have
undergone long-term (16 months) intervention. Our overall hypothesis is that PDAE â a cognitively engaging AE
â is more effective at reducing OFF-time and improving cognition than WAE. However, similar to WAE, we
believe PDAE is neuroprotective in PD. We will randomly assign 102 veterans with mild-moderate PD to 16
months of PDAE or WAE. The 16-month observation period is required to robustly assess neuroprotection with
imaging outcomes. The innovative 16-month intervention period will consist of previously established Training
(3 months of biweekly sessions) and novel Maintenance (13 months of weekly sessions) phases. We will assess
participants at baseline, 3 months (immediately post-Training), and 16 months (immediately post-Maintenance)
for OFF-time and behaviorally and physiologically measured cognition. We will acquire NM-MRI and R2* imaging
data at baseline and 16 months to assess neuroprotection. We will: 1. examine effects of Training and
Maintenance phases of PDAE vs. WAE on OFF-time; 2. compare PDAE vs WAE at 3 and 16 months on
behavioral and fMRI measures of spatial cognition; and 3. compare PDAE vs. WAE for effects on rates of
neurodegeneration. The primary outcome measure of Aim 1 will be the Movement Disorders Society Unified
Parkinson Disease Rating Scale Part IV score, which assays MRMF. The primary outcome measure for spatial
cognition of Aim 2 will be the Corsi blocks. For the first time, we will use promising, cutting edge imaging
techniques to reveal whether PDAE, used as long-term exercise, slows neurodegeneration in PD more than
walking. Understanding the relationships between drug efficacy and exercise modalities will allow clinicians to
better treat PD. Understanding the mechanisms for improving cognition via PDAE will determine whether PDAE,
a scalable, readily available treatment, is a robust model of concurrent physical/mental training to address CI in
PD. This project combines patient-centered, clinical science and mechanistic aims to improve veteran health
care."

Gliomas represent one of the most fatal and difficult to treat cancers. Despite the aggressive therapies,
including surgical resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy the median survival time for patients remains very
poor. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a noninvasive therapy for treating locally invasive malignant
tumors such as glioma. BNCT is a robust therapy with clear advantages as it relies on the nuclear capture and
fission reactions. Despite clear advantages, BNCT have not been as effective in the clinic due to inability to
achieve adequate amounts of Boron-10 (an active drug) concentration selectively in the target cancer cells,
which remains an unsolved problem. The studies proposed here are intended to fill a critical void using a
nanomedicine-based approach, which is uniquely poised to offer a solution to this unsolved problem. We have
developed nanodrugs for imaging and treatment of the primary and metastatic brain tumors. Here we propose
a novel nanodrug (Nano-10Boron), based on a natural, nontoxic and biodegradable polymer carrying in excess
of 300 molecules of Boron-10 enriched 4-boronophenylalanine (BPA) to cross blood-brain barrier (BBB) and
actively target and deliver high Bopron-10 concentration to glioma cells for effective BNCT. In Aim 1, we will
establish optimum functionating lead Nano-10Boron. This will be achieved by synthesizing next-generation
Nano-10Borons with varied loading of BPA and a tumor targeting and BBB transport peptide Angiopep-2 (Ap2).
In our preliminary studies, we used 12 Ap2 molecules and 300 BPA molecules covalently attached to PMLA
to form a first-generation Nano-10Boron. Our goal is to prepare a lead Nano-10Boron with maximum allowable
number of BPA molecules to enhance intracellular Boron-10 concentrations to boost the treatment outcome.
Aim 2 will focus on establishing an ideal time window for neutron flux irradiation for greater BNCT effect. PK
of our first-generation Nano-10Boron is about 1.44 h (see preliminary results for details) whereas, PK of free
BPA used in clinical studies ranges in few minutes. Additionally, PMLA based nanodrugs utilizes active
targeting and remains in tumor for relatively longer period, while clearing out from the systemic circulation
providing grater tumor uptake. Studies outlines in this aim will determine the optimum time window when we
have the highest Boron-10 concentrations in tumor vs surrounding healthy brain, facilitating effective BNCT
response while minimizing any potential off targeting toxicity to the healthy brain. Aim 3 will utilize the lead
Nano-10Boron to treat glioma baring mice to improve the survival. Lead Nano-10Boron will be injected at the
optimum dose developed in the previous aim followed by irradiation with low energy neutrons to treat glioma
baring animals and improve the survival time. The proposed work will solve the long-standing problem of
Boron-10 delivery, thereby making BNCT a practical therapy for glioma treatment, improve patient survival and
enhance the quality of life. The results of this study could lay the groundwork for a novel treatment option for
glioma for clinical applications.

In response to RFA-MD-21-007, we propose the Rutgers-NYU Center for Asian Health Promotion and Equity
(CAHPE) to advance interdisciplinary research on comorbid cardiometabolic disease and mental health of Asian
adults. There are currently significant disparities in relationship to Heart and Mind, with lower thresholds for BMI
for Asians and disproportionate disparities related to cardiometabolic disease and mental health. Such an
important focus in research, population and investigators will inform both practice and policy at community,
regional and national levels. Asians are the fastest growing yet most understudied US minority group at 23 million
people and growing 26% from 2010-2019. Yet, < 1% of NIH research funding in the last 10 years were focused
on US Asian populations. Moreover, this population experiences the âAsian Paradoxâ: while on average, US
Asians, are the highest-income earners and the most highly educated, more Asians, especially older adults, live
below the poverty line, are less likely to participate in biomedical research, and suffer disproportional health
disparities compared to white Americans. These health inequities are further complicated by the heterogeneity
of these immigrant populations, especially with respect to culture, religion, language, sexual identity, and trauma
exposure, many of which challenge our assumptions about the âmodel minorityâ stereotype.
 Building on two decades of rigorous aging research in minority populations and track records of
successful academic achievements, we have leveraged strong existing transdisciplinary partnerships across
multiple academic and community institutions to build a center designed to foster the next generation of diverse
researchers in a nurturing environment that is conducive to success and promotes highly relevant and rigorous
translational research on cardiometabolic and mental health outcomes among US Asians. With strong
institutional support of $3 million in matching funds, our Center will have five inter-connected aims: 1)
Provide leadership, organizational communication, and evaluation systems designed to achieve the overarching
goals of supporting high quality and enduring inter-disciplinary research on cardiometabolic and mental health
outcomes among Asian adults; 2) Guide solicitation and selection of 6 pilot studies per year; 3) Implement the
three interdisciplinary, translational, and synergistic R01-like projects with specific focus on: Nutritional, Positive
Affect, and Dementia Caregiving Interventions to multi-prong target diverse Asian population at high risk; 4)
Enhance, track, and evaluate existing infrastructure to support and synchronize the pilot and center projects;
and 5) Disseminate these findings to the local, regional, and national levels in order to inform the design of future
prevention/intervention research commodities. The overall aims of this application reflect the synergistic work of

10864010,"Project Summary
Asthma pathogenesis is characterized by airway inflammation, remodeling and hyperresponsiveness
resulting in severe bronchoconstriction. Allergen-induced inflammatory mediators act on immune cells
and structural airways cells and activate intracellular signaling. The Activator Protein-1 (AP-1)
transcription factor complex is a central regulator that responds to signaling pathways activated by
cytokines, growth factors and other inflammatory signals in airway cells to mediate airway remodeling in
asthma. Therefore, upregulated AP-1, which contributes to multiple features of asthma pathogenesis, is
an attractive anti-asthma therapeutic target. The Extracellular signalâRegulated protein Kinases
(ERK1/2) are key regulators of AP-1 activity in airway smooth muscle (ASM), lung fibroblasts (LF), and
other lung cells that contribute to the pathology of asthma. Taking advantage of ERK1/2 structural
interactions with specific substrates, we identified a novel compound that binds to a unique ERK1/2
substrate docking site that mediates interactions with AP-1 complex proteins and inhibits ERK1/2-
mediated AP-1 activity. Targeting select kinase functions offers advantages in reducing acquired drug
resistance and toxicity observed with the current kinase inhibitors that target ATP binding sites and block
all enzymatic activity. We demonstrate that function-selective ERK1/2 inhibitors inhibit ASM cell
proliferation, AP-1 activity, and mitigate multiple features of allergic asthma in a murine model.
Considering that upregulated ERK1/2 activity contributes to the pathogenesis of asthma, we hypothesize
that function-selective inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling through the AP-1 will mitigate ASM and LF cell
hyperplasia, hypertrophy, extracellular matrix (ECM) hypersecretion, and other features of asthma. The
R61 phase will consist of two aims. Aim 1 will use computer-aided drug design and chemical synthesis
to generate optimized analogs of a lead function-selective ERK1/2 inhibitor that targets regulation of AP-
1 proteins. Aim 2 will evaluate new compounds in regulating AP-1 mediated hyperplasia, ECM secretion,
and inflammatory mediators in primary ASM and LF cells obtained from normal and asthmatic lungs. Aim
3 in the R33 phase will employ an integrated mouse model of asthma to assess the most potent
compounds in mitigating multiple features of allergic asthma. In addition, R33 phase will collaborate with
an Accelerator Partner, Gen1E, Life Sciences, to perform pre-clinical testing and development of the top
3 compounds focusing on pharmacokinetic evaluation, kinase selectivity, off-target effects, and toxicity.
These studies will provide important pre-clinical data to advance a novel therapy that effectively inhibits
a major effector target (e.g., AP-1) involved in the pathology of asthma."
11196569,"This application seeks to establish an R25 Research Education Program, âEnhancing
Diversity among Future ELSI Researchers,â with the long-term objective of helping to
diversify the pool of ELSI researchers and thus enrich ELSI scholarship. Our program
would draw on regional diversity to build a pipeline that identifies and recruits promising
undergraduates from populations historically underrepresented in ELSI and bioethics.
Our specific aims are: 1) To recruit undergraduate students from diverse,
underrepresented groups and backgrounds to explore and conduct research in
genomics and society studies (methods, skills, history, and content); 2) To mentor and
support small cohorts of interdisciplinary trainees, exposing them to career options in
genomics and society studies and sparking their interest in pursuing such a career, and
integrating them into local, regional, and national bioethics networks; and, 3) To nurture
and strengthen relationships between and among bioethics scholars and units at
universities in the Baltimore-DC area, creating and sustaining a regional pipeline for the
entry of students from diverse, underrepresented groups and backgrounds into
genomics and society studies, and the institutional structures and networks to support
them over time.
Through the R25, our program faculty and staff will create a 15-month training and
mentorship experience, the entry point of which will be a new Genomics and Society
division of the Johns Hopkins Diversity Summer Internship Program (SIP), offering an
intensive 10-week ELSI research experience. The BI will be able to offer multiple
research experiences through individual faculty research and through our CEER,
Bridging Infectious Disease, Genomics & Society (BRIDGES). Following the on-campus
summer program, students will continue their connection to the Hopkins Program
throughout the academic year, co-lead the planning of an activity (e.g., seminar, panel,
outreach event) related to their interests in Genomics and Society at their home
institution, and return to Hopkins and the Berman Institute for one week the following
summer for additional training and connection with the next cohort of trainees. The R25
will fund five trainees per year for five years. An additional trainee each year will be
funded by University of Maryland Baltimore County, one of our regional partners."

10909132,"Justice-involved individuals have high rates of trait, state, and precipitating risk factors for suicide, account for a
significant proportion of U.S. suicides each year, and many are not well-connected to care. The National Center
for Health and Justice Integration for Suicide Prevention (NCHATS): (1) uses contact with the justice system
(e.g., police contact, arrest) as a novel indicator of suicide risk in the general population; (2) demonstrates how
big data systems that efficiently track justice involvement can be linked to health system records and scaled to
identify individuals at risk for suicide and connect them to care; and (3) examines effectiveness and scalability
of suicide prevention approaches using these methods. Center projects are hybrid effectiveness-implementation
studies that examine effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and scalability of suicide prevention activities triggered
through linkage of justice and health data. Given that contact with the justice system is a sign of risk for suicide,
big data integration across justice/health systems to flag movement between systems (and therefore suicide
risk) provides a novel method of identifying suicide risk in the general population. This approach does not require
collecting new data from this hard-to-reach population. Rather, it sets up strategies to efficiently link existing data
and to test methods to respond. This is an innovative and potentially scalable approach to identify/address
suicide risk for individuals not well-connected with standard health care. The Center is innovative in that it: (1)
establishes a suicide prevention intervention effectiveness base for a large and high-risk target population,
conducting (a) 2 of only 3 fully-powered suicide prevention RCTs in justice populations, and (b) the largest RCTs
of any intervention for any condition in a justice-involved population to date; (2) develops and manualizes
strategies for scalability and sustainment -- understudied areas of implementation science; (3) uses contact with
the justice system as a novel indicator of suicide risk in the general population; (4) uses sociometric identification
of key individuals to promote diffusion and dissemination of Center approaches; (5) demonstrates how efficient,
generalizable health and justice system big data linkage is achieved and can be used to automate suicide risk
identification and response across health and justice systems at scale. This is extremely rarely done in practice
and never before tested as a method of improving health outcomes in justice populations. By incorporating the
few cases of which we are aware into this Center, we are poised to rapidly advance the field. Center aims are
to: (1) Evaluate effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of suicide prevention approaches that use justice contacts
as markers of risk and health/justice system data linkage to provide scalable ways to alert providers of this risk;
(2) Maximize scalability, sustainability, relevance, and dissemination of identified approaches and identify, refine,
and manualize scalability/sustainment strategies to be fully tested in future trials; and (3) Promote national
research and practice capacity in suicide prevention at justice intercepts. Partners include jails, police, health

Since its formal inception in 2019, the Columbia University Digestive and Liver Disease Research Center (CU-
DLDRC) has brought together an interdisciplinary group of highly accomplished basic, translational and clinical
researchers with complementary backgrounds from different departments and campuses and the New York
Presbyterian Hospital. The CU-DLDRC reflects vibrant growth in digestive disease science over the last two
decades, paired with exceptional institutional support and a dynamic scientific environment at Columbia
University. The CU-DLDRCâs vision is to contribute to improved prevention, detection and therapy of digestive
diseases through the application of creative concepts, cutting-edge research methods, innovation and multi-
disciplinary team science, with a strong emphasis on clinical relevance and translation. The CU-DLDRC includes
49 digestive-focused members (30 full, 19 associate) with NIH funding of $20.8M direct costs (35.6% from
NIDDK). The central theme âEpithelial cells and their interactions in digestive homeostasis and diseaseâ, reflects
the passion and expertise of its members and its key role in digestive diseases. The broad coverage of digestive
organs under this theme is predicated upon the conceptual framework that many disease-driving pathways, cell-
cell interactions and therapeutic targets are shared across digestive organs. Guided by these principles,
digestive disease research at Columbia has witnessed significant growth and impact, fruitful collaborations and
joint publications and grants to a degree that would not have been achieved by studies in single digestive organs.
The Administrative Core ensures success and effectiveness of the CU-DLDRC through management of its
research base, operational oversight, scientific vision, innovation, and structures and activities that stimulate
translational digestive science with maximum member benefits (Aim 1). The four biomedical cores offer a suite
of closely linked state-of-the-art core facilities that span from clinical biospecimens and databases to cutting-
edge bioinformatics, organoid platforms and advanced bioimaging, empowering members to investigate
epithelial cells and their interactions; these powerful research methods will be linked the breadth of clinical
expertise and biospecimens via organ-focused clinical-basic teams (Aim 2). The Pilot and Feasibility program,
that to date has funded seven investigators with an exceptional rate of return, will promote impactful basic and
clinical projects, thereby promoting new investigators, innovation and the integration of excellence from other
fields (Aim 3). The Enrichment Program will stimulate intellectual exchange within our center and with the national
digestive community through seminars, an annual retreat, and basic-clinical symposia; support new investigators
and training through a formal mentoring program and workshops; and promote Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
(DEI) in all components and activities of the CU-DLDRC through a DEI delegate (Aim 4). Through these Aims,
the CU-DLDRC will make impactful contributions to digestive disease research and serve our patients."

This project is directly aligned with the NIAâs strategic goals of 1) developing improved approaches for the early
detection and diagnosis of disabling illnesses and age-related debilitating conditions and 2) identifying
appropriate strategies for disease, illness, and disability prevention and healthy aging among the underserved.
As the older adult population continues to grow, it is expected that an increasing number of seniors will be living
with Alzheimerâs disease and related dementias. As such, it is imperative to identify early risk markers of cognitive
decline prior to symptom manifestation. Although Hispanics/Latinos (henceforth referred to as Hispanics) are at
increased risk for mild cognitive impairment compared to non-Hispanic Whites, research investigating early risk
markers in this growing and underserved segment of the United States (U.S.) population is lacking. One potential
early risk marker of Alzheimerâs disease is subjective cognitive decline (SCD), which is used to describe self-
reported perceived changes in cognitive function compared to a previous state. Although the expression,
reporting, and predictive value of SCD may vary due to factors such as cultural/ethnic background, acculturation,
and education level, little research has been conducted outside of non-Hispanic White cohorts. In fact, most
existing SCD research with Hispanics has been conducted in Spain, whose population is very culturally different
than Hispanics living in the U.S. The proposed study will help advance SCD research by characterizing the
cognitive and biomarker correlates of SCD in U.S. Hispanics cross-sectionally, and by establishing its predictive
value for cognitive change over three years. To achieve this, we will prospectively administer a validated SCD
questionnaire, a culturally sensitive cognitive test battery, mood questionnaires (i.e., depression), and culturally-
relevant measures that may influence SCD to older Hispanics with normal cognition (N=100) or mild cognitive
impairment (N=100). We will also obtain SCD reports from participantâs informants to determine its differential
ability to predict cognitive decline. Participant recruitment will leverage on existing cohorts at two sites: The
University of California San Diego Shiley-Marcos Alzheimerâs Disease Research Center (ADRC) and the
1Florida ADRC. We will investigate if self and informant SCD reports are associated with concurrent, objective
cognitive function (adjusting for relevant covariates) and examine if baseline SCD reports predict change in
cognition over 3 years. Moreover, we will use existing biomarkers collected by the ADRCs, as well as novel
blood-based biomarkers, to investigate if SCD is associated with amyloid-Î² and apolipoprotein E Îµ4 allelic status.
Furthermore, we will investigate if acculturation, health literacy, country of origin, and language of testing, as well
as demographic variables (age, sex, years of education) influence SCD reporting. Findings will characterize the
cognitive and biomarker profile and predictive value of SCD in U.S. Hispanics, help refine SCD measurement,
and identify individual differences in SCD reporting that may confer greater risk for decline."
10795824,"ABSTRACT
 Spontaneous T cell pressure against an evolving tumor is a conserved mechanism of anti-tumor immune
control. On the other hand, immune therapies directed to alleviate paralyzing T cell dysfunction within solid
tumors only benefits a small proportion of patients with metastatic disease. The field is in desperate need for the
development of complementary therapies capable of enhancing sustained T cell-mediated control of primary and
metastatic tumor growth. However, myeloid cells within tumors present a substantial barrier towards overcoming
the immune dysfunction present in most cancers.
 Here, we demonstrate that recognition of commensal bacteria through TLR5 signaling results in sustained
myeloid dysfunction and impaired response to PD-L1 blockade. TLR5 signaling broadly impairs myeloid function,
resulting in infiltration of tumors with poorly functional T cells. In TLR5 KO mice, PD-L1 blockade achieves
significantly increased overall survival and leads to durable and long-term remission for mice bearing aggressive
ovarian tumors. The effect of TLR5 signaling is recapitulated in non-responsive melanoma and breast tumor
models, suggesting that this signaling pathway is a conserved mechanism of immune suppression and failure
for PD-L1 blockade. Mechanisms underlying myeloid dysfunction and failure of PD-L1 blockade have largely
focused upon interactions between tumors and immune cells. However, our data implicate a mechanism
whereby recognition of commensal bacteria by TLR5-expressing immune cells initiates myeloid dysfunction and
failure of PD-L1 blockade. Based upon these data, inhibition of TLR5 signaling emerges as a means of restoring
anti-tumor T cell function across a broad range of tumor types. However, because TLR5 signaling is canonically
associated with activation of adaptive immunity in other settings, it is critical to understand how TLR5 signaling
impairs myeloid function within the tumor microenvironment.
 The overarching goal is to define how commensal microorganisms impair anti-tumor immunity and response
to PD-L1 blockade. Here, we will test the hypothesis that chronic encounter with microbiome-derived TLR5
ligands and autocrine amplification of IL-6 polarize TLR5-expressing myeloid cells within the tumor
microenvironment (TME). This results in impaired ability of myeloid cells to prime and/or recall tumor-reactive T
cells and subsequent failure of PD-L1 blockade. Aim 1 will define how TLR5 signaling on myeloid cells affects
tumor growth and response to PD-L1 blockade. Aim 2 will determine how TLR5 signaling impairs myeloid
function. Aim 3 will leverage in vivo labelling of commensal microorganisms to establish how encounters between
commensal microorganisms and TLR5 expressing immune cells within the tumor microenvironment impair anti-
tumor immune function. Mechanistically, very little is known as to how the microbiome negatively impacts host
anti-tumor immune function. The studies proposed herein will fill this gap in knowledge, providing critical insight
into how host-microbiome crosstalk negatively impacts anti-tumor immunity and response to PD-L1 blockade."

Development of improved serological diagnostic and parasite genotyping tools for congenital
Chagas disease
Chagas disease is a neglected disease caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. It is a
serious public health issue in Latin America and the southern United States. Diagnosis of chronically
infected patients, including congenital and maternal cases, is based on antibody detection. PA-18-031
priorities for Trypanosoma cruzi include the development of new diagnostic tests with high validity and
reliability for timely detection of congenital and maternal T. cruzi infection. Indeed, the WHO
recommends a minimum of two positive tests to establish diagnosis, due to limited sensitivity and
specificity and frequent discordant results. Part of the discordances may be attributed to the very large
genetic and antigenic diversity of T. cruzi, which has been divided into seven discrete typing units
(DTUs) TcI-TcVI and Tcbat. Indeed, current serological tests are based on a very limited set of parasite
antigens/strains which do not reflect the entire range of T. cruzi diversity and multiclonal infections.
There is thus a critical need for more reliable tests based on panels of conserved antigens allowing
detection of all T. cruzi genotypes. On the other hand, while parasite genotyping is straightforward in
parasite culture and in vector samples, current PCR-based techniques have a low sensitivity with blood
samples from chagasic patients. Another critical need is therefore to identify new molecular markers of
T. cruzi DTUs, allowing a more sensitive genotyping in clinical samples. In aim 1, we will improve
serological diagnostic of maternal and congenital T. cruzi infection identifying new conserved T. cruzi
antigens. In Aim 2, we will improve the sensitivity of current molecular tools for genotyping by
sequencing of T. cruzi in clinical samples from pregnant women and newborns. We will perform a
bioinformatics screening of T. cruzi genome sequences from multiple DTUs for new antigens and
molecular markers coupled with high-throughput immuno-screening with peptide arrays and multiplex
PCR and sequencing, respectively. Antigens identified for diagnostic in an ELISA platform will be used
in a rapid test platform for the accurate diagnostic of T. cruzi infection. We will also perform a
retrospective analysis of parasite genotype and multi-strain infection on maternal and congenital
Chagas disease. At the completion of these studies, we expect to have identified a set of conserved
antigens for a novel rapid test for a reliable diagnostic and one or more molecular markers for
genotyping by sequencing of all T. cruzi DTUs in pregnant women and newborns. These advances will
also spur on molecular research on T. cruzi much beyond our own research focus, by further exploring
parasite evolution and genetic diversity allowing us the to understand the potential relations between
parasite characteristics, congenital transmission and clinical symptoms."

While the mechanisms modulating the transmission and perception of chronic pain differ
between men and women, the exact neuroanatomical and molecular differences existing
between the sexes remain only partly understood. This proposal focuses on the study of
intracellular mechanisms that modulate symptoms of long-term pain states in female mice. We
have identified signal transduction mechanisms in the mouse ventrolateral periaqueductal gray
(vlPAG) that selectively modulate sensory symptoms of inflammatory and neuropathic pain in
female mice. The signal transduction modulator Regulator of G Protein Signaling-1 (RGSz1)
controls the function of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) by binding to activated Gï¡i
subunits, including the Golgi enriched Gï¡z. RGSz1 negatively modulates the amplitude and
direction of signal transduction of several GPCRs involved in the modulation of pain processing,
including the serotonin 5HT1A receptor. We recently found that RGSz1 mRNA and protein
levels are dynamically regulated in the vlPAG of female (but not male) mice by long-term
peripheral inflammation. Constitutive deletion of the RGSz1 gene or vlPAG-specific knockdown
of RGSz1, exacerbate sensory hypersensitivity behaviors such as thermal hyperalgesia and
mechanical allodynia in female mice, but they have no effect in male mice. We will investigate
the mechanisms regulating the expression of RGSz1 in the male and female vlPAG at various
points after the induction of peripheral nerve injury or inflammation. We will apply several
genetic mouse models for regional inactivation or overexpression of RGSz1 in vlPAG neuronal
subsets, along with brain biochemistry, electrophysiology and voltammetry to understand the
sex-specific role of RGSz1 in the function of the descending inhibitory pathway in models of
chronic pain. Since RGSz1 plays a prominent role in the function of the Golgi apparatus, will
apply chronic pain models to understand the impact of RGSz1 on the expression levels of trans-
Golgi components in the presence and in the absence of pain. Finally, we will use RNA
Sequencing to understand the impact of RGSz1 on gene expression adaptations underlying
chronic pain states."

elevated blood pressure, which is the most important modifiable contributor to heart disease - far and away the
leading cause of death in our region. By increasing reach in census tracts with increased social vulnerability
where lifespan disparities and uncontrolled cardiometabolic risk factors are most prevalent, our study design

10812305,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Soil transmitted helminths (STH) - hookworms (Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus),
Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura - are among the most widespread neglected tropical diseases
(NTD) of humans worldwide, disproportionately affecting the poorest and most vulnerable communities. In
rural, populations, intensive animal-human mixing with livestock and companion animals combined with poor
hygiene and sanitation can lead to transmission of zoonotic infections as well as result in zoonotic sources
of infection. It is estimated that 30% of households globally have domestic livestock animals, with south and
southeast Asia and Africa contributing the largest proportion. These regions also have the highest burden of
STH globally. Most epidemiological surveys and mathematical models of STH do not account for or measure
the risk of infections acquired from zoonotic sources, either by direct contact with animals or animal feces or
indirectly from the environment. The inability to interrupt transmission due to presence of zoonotic and
environmental reservoirs of infection may prolong mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns and result in
emergence of anthelmintic resistance.
 The overarching goal of this multi-disciplinary collaborative application is to use a One Health
framework to examine the interconnected burden and transmission patterns between human, animal and
environmental reservoirs of STH by integrating carefully collected epidemiological, environmental and
qualitative research data with state-of-art molecular techniques to better inform monitoring and elimination
strategies in endemic communities. We will leverage an ongoing randomized controlled trial on community
wide MDA and an upcoming One Health project in two eco-epidemiologically and culturally distinct
geographic regions of India (Tamil Nadu and Meghalaya) to: (1) comprehensively investigate the
transmission dynamics of different STH species at individual, household and community levels; (2) ascertain
the impact of community wide MDA on zoonotic STH transmission and screen for emergence of
benzimidazole resistance markers; and (3) develop and validate field-ready, portable point-of-collection
(POC) diagnostics for STH based on prevalent human and zoonotic species. The field and laboratory data
will provide the key parameters to build species-specific STH transmission models and explore the impact of
human, animal and environmental reservoirs on STH control measures, across a range of transmission
scenarios. The One Health framework of this TMRC will provide much needed data for future planning of
integrated STH control programs that combine community wide MDA with upgraded WASH, supported by
POC molecular diagnostics. The center will provide a platform for early career investigators to conduct multi-
disciplinary One Health research on STH as well as other zoonotic or helminth NTDs."

10897139,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Health disparities in the burden of multiple chronic conditions for low-income and racial/ethnic minority groups
are pervasive and have their roots in social determinants of health and unequal access to evidence-based health
care services during critical periods of life. A long history of racial segregation in the Chicago region has resulted
in neighborhoods that are disproportionately burdened by poverty and related social determinants of health as
well as poor access to high quality health resources. Unequal distribution of resources across the Chicago region
results in geographic âhotspotsâ where high numbers of residents suffer from multiple cardiometabolic conditions.
Innovative local solutions are necessary to bridge gaps in the healthcare system, gaps in the traditional approach
to delivering preventive and management services, and gaps generated by the traditional siloed approach to
science. The Chicago Chronic Condition Equity Network (C3EN) will address these gaps by strengthening
collaborations across community-based organizations, practice networks, and academic researchers, by
promoting a comprehensive approach to the prevention and management of multiple chronic conditions that
accounts for mental health, functional health and social life, and by supporting interventions that actively seek to
cross boundaries of disease-specific management, professional training, community and practice. This network
will be the communication channel for multi-directional exchange of ideas regarding how to address disparities
in communities, the community-based research network where both pilot studies and larger regional studies of
scalable interventions will take place, and the training ground for new investigators. Our research projects have
been selected to demonstrate our scientific thematic interest in promoting a comprehensive view of health that
acknowledges the importance of physical, psychological, and social functioning as outcomes as well as potential
avenues for health improvement. The C3EN will benefit from a foundation of multiple institutes and centers at
the University of Chicago and Rush that set the stage for conducting interdisciplinary research aligned with public
health goals of the Chicago region, inter-institutional collaboration, and models for training programs. Our
Centerâs Specific Aims are: 1) To build a Chicago regional community-based research network based on
collaborations with key stakeholder groups including community-based organizations, networks of ambulatory
practices, and academic institutions, to identify innovative, effective, and scalable interventions that reduce
disparities for multiple chronic conditions; 2) To provide cutting edge research support and expertise
(intersectoral health, informatics, implementation science, community-resource referral software systems,
remote sensor technology) to facilitate chronic condition health disparities research conducted across practice
networks, in community settings, and in the home; and 3) To attract and support diverse new investigators by
providing education, training, mentoring, support for community and stakeholder engagement, pilot grant
funding, and access to research support."
