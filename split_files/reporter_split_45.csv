 PARP1 and PARP2 are DNA damage-induced poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) transferases, which are recruited
to and activated by DNA breaks. Active PARP1&2 PARylate themselves and histones to promote DNA repair
and chromatin relaxation. Dual-specificity inhibitors (PARPi) for PARP1 and PARP2 are currently used for the
treatment of BRCA1/2-deficient breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers. However, severe anemia
occurs in ~ one-third of patients, leading to dose reduction and premature termination of PAPRi therapy. PARPi
also cause significant clonal hematopoiesis, a condition that increases the risk for myeloid dysplasia and acute-
myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML). These hematopoietic toxicities are unexpected since the complete loss of Parp1
that is responsible for >80% of DNA damage-induced PARylation in cells, has no impact on hematopoiesis. To
understand this potential on-target toxicity of PARPi, we generated mouse models with knockin catalytically
inactive mutations in Parp2 – Poly-ADP-Ribosylation (PARylation) deficient (E534A, Parp2EA) or Mono-ADP-
Ribosylation (MARylation) deficient (H404A, Parp2HA). In contrast to the normal development of Parp2-/- mice,
mice expressing PARylation deficient PARP2 (Parp2EA/EA) died at embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) with severe
anemia and stage-specific blocks in erythropoiesis. The Parp2HA/HA mice are viable but display splenomegaly
and chronic anemia. Meanwhile, our cell biology analyses suggest that clinically used PARPi effectively stalls
PARP2, but not PARP1, on laser-induced DNA damage sites. Based on these and other observations, we
hypothesize that PARP2 has PARylation-dependent structural functions that preferentially block nick
ligation during DNA replication, underlie the PARP inhibitors-induced erythropoiesis defects and anemia.
Specifically, we propose that catalytically inactive PARP2 were trapped on DNA breaks, especially 5’pho-nicks,
where they prevent other repair factors (e.g., Ligase1) from accessing the DNA nicks. Correspondingly, like the
Parp2EA/EA mice, Lig1-/- mice also succumbed to lethal anemia at E16.5. To test our hypothesis, we will Aim 1)
investigate the mechanism that regulates PARP2 recruitment and dynamics at DNA damage sites using live-cell
imaging and bulk biochemical assays; Aim 2) determine the impacts of catalytically inactive PARP2 on the
recruitment and function of other DNA repair factors, and DNA replication in vivo and in vitro; Aim 3) characterize
the mouse models expressing catalytically inactive - Parp2 and investigate how the loss of Trp53, CHK2, two
genes associated clonal hematopoiesis, modulates the anemia in Parp2EA/EA models. The completion of the
proposal will characterize the previously unrecognized structural functions of PARP2, address how catalytically
inactive PARP2 compromises DNA replication and selectively abrogates erythropoiesis, providing the strategy
to mitigate this on-targeted toxicity of PARP inhibitors by reducing PARP2 stalling."
10850709,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mutation is the ultimate source of genetic and genomic variation and the relationship between mutation and evolution-
ary change is a fundamental question in biology. Mutations can occur as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or
larger structural variants (SVs) like duplications, deletions and copy number variants. Molecular studies have focused
extensively on SNP variation but DNA sequencing technologies are increasingly demonstrating the prevalence and im-
portance of genomic SVs. The recency means that there is little understanding of SVs in evolution and few theoretical
predictions to guide empirical investigations. For example, organisms with holocentric chromosomes, characterized
by diffuse centromeres spread across the length of the chromosome, can have high rates of intrachromosomal
rearrangements and SVs segregating in populations. The sojourn time of a mutation fundamentally affects the
dynamics of natural selection and may differ for SNPs and SVs. Understanding the evolutionary significance of SVs
requires greater understanding of the ways in which population genetic forces of drift, selection and recombination act
on SVs, the long-term outcomes of SVs in genomes and the mechanisms that generate segregating SV mutations.
This application proposes to address these gaps in scientific understanding by addressing 3 questions:
1) What are the population genetics of SV mutations?
2) How do SV mutations accumulate to differences in genome size and content?
3) Does the frequency spectrum of SVs vary between organisms with holocentric and metacentric
chromosomes?
 To answer these questions my lab group will pursue a synergistic set of theoretical and comparative genomic
projects. We will study a theoretical graph-based model of SVs and formulate a comprehensive population genetic
theory of SV evolution. We will use our theory to formulate predictions regarding SV evolution and test our predictions
by analyzing empirical genomic change in a phylogenetic comparative framework and studying the spectrum of
SVs in holocentric and monocentric organisms. My research program uses an innovative combination of theory
and comparative computational genomics to address fundamental evolutionary questions. The research proposed
here will result in exciting discoveries unlocking the rules of eukaryotic genome evolution."
10850710,"Biodegradable metallo-elastomer
 Biodegradable elastomers are useful in many biomedical applications. Elastomers are crosslinked network
polymers. The crosslinks can be made of covalent bonds or weak bonds such as a physical bond. The former
produces thermosets, which usually have high elasticity but cannot be processed after crosslinking. The latter
produces thermoplastics, which usually have lower elasticity but are easier to process. Metal coordination bond
has medium bond strength in between covalent bonds and weak physical bonds. We will invent a series of
biodegradable metallo-elastomers where the crosslink is formed by metal coordination bonds. An advantage of
this approach is that one polymeric ligand can bind many different metal ions, thereby producing variant
elastomers, each with unique properties. Furthermore, metal ions have inherent bioactivities, an area
underexplored in biomaterials. Our preliminary study demonstrates that the materials can be highly elastic;
matching or exceeding the elasticity of elastomers crosslinked by covalent bonds. Furthermore, the resultant
elastomers contain very small amounts of metal ions and exhibit no noticeable toxicity. On the contrary, they are
more biocompatible than polycaprolactone (PCL), used in many FDA-approved medical implants.
 Many transition metal ions have inherent bioactivity. Enzymes further enhance and specify these activities by
providing amino acid ligands and binding pockets. Copper ion (Cu2+) is one of the first angiogenic factors
discovered and is known to upregulate angiogenic growth factors. In redox enzymes such as superoxide
dismutase, Cu2+ provides the critical redox activity to break down the superoxide radical. This research will
elucidate the structure-function relationship of metallo-elastomers in two specific aims: the first will explore the
pro-angiogenic properties of Cu2+, the second will study the anti-ROS activities of Cu2+. Taking advantage of the
elasticity of these polymers, we will test the polymers created in this proposal in models of skin wound healing.
Aim 1 will investigate the angiogenic properties of Cu metallo-elastomers and their potential in improving the
survival of skin flaps. Aim 2 will investigate the capability of Cu metallo-elastomer to decompose reactive oxygen
species using a polymer bearing basic resemblance to the active site of superoxide dismutase. These materials
will potentially increase the integration of skin grafts.
 Upon completion of this project, we expect to have built a basic framework on how metallo-elastomers interact
with biological systems. We will better understand how altering the basic structure of the elastomer will impact
its function. Furthermore, we will appreciate the effectiveness of these elastomers in increasing the survival and
integration of skin grafts and skin flaps. The knowledge gained will fundamentally impact biomaterial design and
practically impact host integration of medical implants."
10850712,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hospital readmission is an undesirable, costly outcome that may be preventable. Hospitalized
patients with diabetes are at higher risk of readmission within 30 days (30-d readmission) than
patients without diabetes, and >1 million readmissions occur among diabetes patients in the US
annually. Certain interventions can reduce readmission risk, but applying these interventions
widely is cost prohibitive. One approach for improving the efficiency of interventions that reduce
readmission risk is to target high-risk patients. We previously published a model, the Diabetes
Early Readmission Risk Indicator (DERRITM), that predicts the risk of all-cause 30-d readmission
of patients with diabetes. The DERRI, however, has modest predictive accuracy (C-statistic 0.63-
0.69), and requires manual data input. Recently, we demonstrated that adding variables to the
DERRI substantially improves predictive accuracy (DERRIplus, C-statistic 0.82). However, using
this larger model to predict readmission risk based on manual input of data would be too labor
intensive for clinical settings. Indeed, most readmission risk prediction models are limited by the
trade-off between accuracy and ease of use; lack of translation to a tool that integrates with
clinical workflow; modest accuracy; lack of validation; and dependence on data only available
after hospital discharge.
 The objectives of the current proposal are: 1) To develop more accurate all-cause
unplanned 30-d readmission risk prediction models using electronic health record (EHR) data of
patients with diabetes (eDERRI); 2) To translate the models to an automated, EHR-based tool
that predicts % readmission risk of hospitalized patients; and 3) To prospectively validate the
eDERRI models and tool. The new eDERRI models will expand upon the variables in the
DERRIplus based on availability in EHR data (e.g., sociodemographics, encounter history,
medication use, laboratory results, comorbidities, and length of stay). To develop the models, we
will leverage data from the PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN), a multi-center, 40-plus
hospital member of the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet). We will
apply state-of-the-art deep-learning methods to develop optimal predictive models. This project
will analyze a large, multi-center cohort of nearly 340,000 discharges with cutting-edge
techniques to develop better models and translate them to an automated tool that predicts
readmission risk for individual patients with diabetes. The proposed tool would identify higher risk
patients more likely to benefit from intervention, thus improving care and reducing costs."
10850713,"Project Abstract/Summary:
HIV-positive (HIV+) women are at high risk of developing cervical cancer even when treated with antiretroviral
therapy. Current World Health Organization guidelines recommend screen-and-treat with human papilloma virus
(HPV) DNA testing as the optimal approach for cervical cancer screening in low resource settings. However,
HIV+ women have exceptionally high rates of HPV infection which lead, in the screen-and-treat approach, to
substantial overtreatment. What is needed is a simple method to triage HPV+HIV+ women. We propose to build
on more than two decades of collaboration between the University of Cape Town and Columbia University
investigating how to strengthen cervical cancer screening in South Africa. We have recently demonstrated that
a point-of-care HPV DNA assay can be adapted for screen-and-treat for HIV-positive women. We propose to
extend this work to investigate whether new technologies of automated visual evaluation of digital images of the
cervix have clinical utility in conjunction with HPV testing. We propose to utilize our established clinical research
platform in Cape Town to recruit HIV-positive and HIV-negative women to address the following two specific
aims. Specific Aim 1 will investigate the clinical utility of automated visual evaluation of digital images taken using
the MobileODT platform as a triage assessment method for HPV+HIV+ women compared to other alternatives,
including adaptation of HPV DNA tests, cytology and expert colposcopy. Specific Aim 2 will investigate the clinical
utility of automated visual evaluation as an assessment method to detect treatment failure among women who
have undergone ablative treatment procedures as part of prior rounds of screening. Over the course of
undertaking this clinical study, Specific Aim 3 will support capacity development and training to implement and
evaluate effective cervical cancer screening technologies into low resource settings within the Eastern Cape and
Limpopo Provinces in South Africa. This will be done through existing capacity development initiatives in the
Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Cape Town."

The SD-NSC Research Development Core (ResDev Core) will provide support for career development of
junior researchers entering the field of basic aging biology, as well as established investigators who wish to join
the field of aging research. Specifically, the ResDev Core will support the scientific goals of SD-NSC to
enhance the understanding of the role of cell heterogeneity in the aging process by promoting career
development of aging researchers in three different ways: 1) by providing seed funding for projects interested
in taking advantage of the unique scientific services offered by the SD-NSC Research Resource Cores
(Human Cell Models of Aging Core, Heterogeneity of Aging Core, and Integrative Models of Aging Core), 2) by
providing conceptual and practical training in the scientific services covered by the three Research Resource
Cores, and 3) by establishing a personalized mentoring program between junior and senior members of the
NSC network and beyond. The ResDev Core will be led by Dr. Malene Hansen, Sanford Burnham Prebys
Medical Discovery Institute (SBP), who brings local, national, and international aging research knowledge, and
extensive expertise and high motivation in mentoring junior scientists. The approach will capitalize on a highly
integrative and innovative approach by providing conceptual and practical training in the scientific Cores along
with formalized mentoring in grant writing and career development. First, a two-track pilot grant program will be
launched in which applicants apply for funding for Core usage and mentoring, either directly from submitted
applications or via a grant-writing support program. Second, a one-day workshop to provide training in the
scientific Cores will take place the day after the yearly La Jolla Aging Meeting, a free one-day aging
symposium at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies (Salk) in San Diego organized by researchers at Salk
and SBP. This workshop will feature modules on the techniques and analyses provided by the three scientific
cores, along with information about potential career tracks in scientific Core services. In addition, a module on
grant writing will be offered. Third and finally, a two-track personalized mentoring program will be established in
which junior researchers will be mentored by established investigators, either as part of the pilot grant program
or via pairing of mentee-mentor relationships formed at national NSC meetings, and beyond."

on revealing heterogeneities in the aging process. The Admin Core will serve as the central point of contact for
all SD-NCS activities, maintaining lines of communication between SD-NSC Cores, as well as between SD-
NSC and the External Advisory Panel, other Nathan Shock Centers (including the Nathan Shock Centers
Coordinating Center (NSC3)), the external research community, and other regional research Centers. The
Admin Core will serve three key functions. First, the Admin Core will oversee activities of the three Research
Resource Cores, namely the Human Cell Models of Aging Core, the Heterogeneity of Aging Core, and the
Integrative Models of Aging Core, to ensure that high quality and efficient services are provided to investigators
performing aging research. This will include both operational and financial oversight. The Admin Core will help
to coordinate the flow of data and resources between Cores (workflow optimization), as well as the
dissemination of data and resources to research labs. The Admin Core will perform regular quality control
assessments, monitor the uptake of Core services by the research community, and balance demand for Core
services with workflow capacity. Finally, the Admin Core will coordinate efforts of an External Advisory Panel
and implement panel recommendations to improve Core services. Second, the Admin Core will facilitate efforts
of the Research Development Core to launch new aging research projects and to promote faculty development
and training. The Admin Core will coordinate efforts to establish and maintain a robust career development
program for aging investigators, with an emphasis on junior investigators and established investigators
entering the aging research field. The Admin Core will help run a pilot grant program, run logistics for training
workshops, and facilitate a mentorship program. Effectiveness of these programs will be monitored and
evaluated by the Admin Core, and adjustments made to these activities based on input from the Executive
Committee and External Advisory Panel. Third, the Admin Core will organize and oversee outreach activities of
the SD-NSC. This will include establishing and maintaining a website to advertise SD-NSC Core services and
NSC accomplishment; interfacing extensively with NSC3, other NSCs, the three SD-NSC participating
Institutions, and other regional research Centers to foster collaborations; working with the Salk
Communications Office to publicize SD-NSC accomplishments; and organizing lectures, symposia, podcasts,
and community events to widely broadcast the importance of aging research. Finally, to accomplish these
tasks, the Admin Core will provide project management services to ensure the three Phases of SD-NSC set-
up, launch, and operation are completed on time and that deliverables are achieved. This will include collection
of quantifiable metrics relevant to all SD-NSC activities to measure success in collaboration with NSC3."
10850835,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Human Cell Models of Aging Core
The SD-NSC Human Cell Models of Aging Core (Human Cell Core) is focused on creating new cellular models
of aging from human fibroblasts, including fibroblasts from a unique cohort representing the full breadth of adult
chronological age and annotated for physical and functional measures of biological age. Genetic model
organisms have long been important for aging research, but there are limitations to the extent to which animal
models faithfully represent the molecular and cellular process of human aging. The overarching goal of this
Core is to create powerful new human cell-based models to enable a wide range of studies into the molecular
and cellular heterogeneities of human aging. Approaches for generating these new human models of aging
draw largely from recent advances in creating induced cell types via the direct conversion of skin cell samples.
Pioneering work from the Human Cell Core co-Lead, Dr. Gage, has shown that aging characteristics are
maintained in these induced cell types. Pairing this approach with equally new approaches for creating 3D
organoid cell cultures representative of different organ and tissue microenvironments, enables the creation of
unprecedented human cell-based models of tissue aging. These models will enable robust analyses of cellular
heterogeneities in human aging processes. As part of this effort, the Core will recruit human subjects ranging in
age from 20–70+ years, thereby representing the full breadth of the healthy adult human age span. These
participants will be extensively phenotyped for key clinical and physiological features of biological aging, and
blood and skin samples will be collected. Skin samples will be used to derive primary dermal fibroblasts, from
which both reprogrammed stem cells and directly induced cell types will be created and banked for sharing.
The Human Cell Core will develop protocols for the direct inducement of different cell types and for the creation
of organoids, including pancreas, kidney, liver, heart, smooth muscle, and vasculature. To promote the uptake
of these new human cell models throughout the basic biology of aging research community, the Core will offer
workshops and training sessions in conjunction with the Research Development Core. The protocols, specific
reagents, and cells will be distributed to NSC affiliates directly from the Human Cell Core, and more broadly
through open resources and cell repositories like the NIA Aging Cell Repository at the Coriell Institute and
Addgene. Subject phenotype data will be shared along with the cell lines. Importantly, the Human Cell Core is
designed to be integrated with the other Research Resource Cores of the SD-NSC, as human cell models
(with subject-specific data) can be fed directly into the Heterogeneity of Aging Core for systems-level analysis
of aging processes (multi-omic and advanced imaging). These complex datasets can then be fed into the
Integrative Models of Aging Core for the application of new and existing integrative analyses. The Human Cell
Core, as a stand-alone resource, and as an integrated component of the SD-NSC Core pipeline, will create
substantial new opportunities to investigate the influences of cellular heterogeneity in human aging processes."
10850839,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Heterogeneity of Aging Core
In line with the pioneering work of Nathan Shock, it is clear that aged tissues accumulate cellular heterogeneity
or mosaicism. This heterogeneity is likely a cause of aging due to impairments in both intercellular interactions
and the coordination of tissue function. The Heterogeneity of Aging Core (Heterogeneity Core) within the San
Diego Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging (SD-NSC) will enable investigators to
probe the heterogeneity of aging over a broad range of scales (from molecules to organelles to single cells and
tissues) by providing access to a diverse suite of state-of-the-art instrumentation and analytical technologies,
as well as experienced Core staff. The Core will provide specific resources for studying key processes
implicated in aging and disease at high resolution, including single-cell next-generation sequencing platforms,
high-resolution imaging systems, and mass spectrometry approaches to measure proteomic and metabolomics
signatures of aging in cells and tissues, with an emphasis on cell-cell heterogeneity and heterogeneity across
tissues. These technologies are rapidly evolving and will continue to do so over the coming years. Utilizing
established Core resources with proven track records for staying current with evolving technologies is the most
effective way to ensure new innovations in analytical technologies are available to the greatest breadth of
aging researchers. The Heterogeneity Core provides specific support for researchers in the aging field by: 1)
providing access to specific scientific services, advice, and expertise, 2) developing and disseminating novel
methods for correlative data acquisitions, and 3) running on-site and virtual training sessions. The
Heterogeneity Core is a critical component in the pipeline of research resources that our SD-NSC will create.
The value of this Core is bolstered by the generation of age-equivalent induced cell types and organoids by the
Human Cell Models of Aging Core, and novel machine-learning capabilities in the Integrative Models of Aging
Core. Together we will provide researchers in the basic biology of aging field with the resources necessary to
make key discoveries into the mechanisms by which we age. The Heterogeneity Core will enable studies into
the cell-cell and tissue heterogeneity of aging and, ultimately, the contributions and mechanisms by which
heterogeneity causes the degeneration and dysfunction that characterizes aging."
10850841,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Integrative Models of Aging Core
Aging is a multi-faceted, multi-scale and heterogeneous process. While specific pathways and genes
associated with aging are beginning to emerge from computational modeling studies, in the age of high-
throughput and single-cell sequencing, proteomic, and imaging analyses, researchers in the aging field must
overcome a number of challenges to integrate and interpret these disparate and often massive datasets.
Because of this high barrier to entry, biology of aging researchers are only beginning to approach the study of
aging using integrated data-driven approaches. To support the mission of the San Diego Nathan Shock Center
of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging (SD-NSC), the Integrative Models of Aging Core (Modeling Core)
will address these challenges by devising strategies for the generation and curation of high-throughput data,
developing novel integrative algorithms and models for interrogating specific aspects of aging biology,
including the role of cellular heterogeneity, and implementing these models via an accessible online portal. The
Modeling Core proposes the following three specific aims. First, the Core will establish sufficient data
infrastructure. Integrative modeling requires high quality pre-processed data obtained from diverse high-
throughput assays. This Aim will identify and implement the hardware and software resources required to pre-
process and store sequencing, proteomics, metabolomics, and imaging data. Second, the Core will implement
and develop integrative models of aging that take into account the heterogenicity of the process. Integrative
computational models will enable the mapping of diverse pre-processed data inputs into integrated
interpretable biological processes. These models can then be used to generate hypotheses that can be tested
in the lab, resulting in the generation of additional datasets, which can be used to refine the models in an
iterative manner. Work in this aim will consist of: 1) fulfilling requests to apply established techniques for the
integrative analysis of data, and 2) developing customized predictive computational models as tools for
answering specific questions regarding aging biology. Finally, the Core will provide widespread access to
integrative modeling tools. While computational models allow for a systematic understanding of specific aging-
related biological processes, widespread access to these models will be needed to maximize impact across
NSCs and across the field of aging. This aim is focused on translating the models and theories into interactive
tools for use by aging biology researchers."

improve worker-related health and safety. The IAFF proposes to deliver eight Hazardous Materials Technician
and eight Confined Space Rescue classes per year, as well as additional refresher training and Train-the-
Trainer modules to ensure program sustainment. During the grant period 16 classes will be held each year,
providing over 25,600 contact hours to 400 workers annually. The IAFF training has a successful history of
development, updating, and delivery of such technical training programs, evidenced by high student pass
rates, highly-rated survey responses, and repeated positive third-party program reviews. The proposed
training will be accessible to all populations that may be responsible for preventing, responding to, or assisting
in recovery of, a HazMat emergency including fire and EMS personnel, law enforcement members, emergency
management and public health officials, industrial responders, as well as local community partners.
Through this continued cooperative agreement, the IAFF will:
1. Utilize advanced GIS and collaborative contact databases to identify and coordinate outreach to target
 populations, giving consideration to increasing diversity and training of underserved populations.
2. Enhance the capabilities of workers through the delivery of updated and improved curricula, that includes
 embedded training on important emerging topics, to improve overall worker health and safety, and
 encourage increased worker and community resiliency.
3. Integrate new technologies (such as electronic tablets, an IAFF online library of tools and resources, mobile
 hotspots, web-based applications, etc.) for course delivery, ensuring consistent deployment to all students
 while also improving access to technology across all student populations.
4. Employ multiple, robust quality assurance protocols to provide defined benchmarks and measure training
 effectiveness. The IAFF is dedicated to ensuring the training program meets and exceeds the NIEHS
 Minimum Training Criteria Document resulting in workers who are safety-conscious, strong decision
 makers, positive role models, and who may serve as worker-trainers in their field."

response, mitigation, and recovery to ensure provider safety, protection of the community, conservation of the
environment, and regulatory compliance. (International Association of Fire Chiefs, 2019) Both responders and
communities must continue to explore new strategies to decrease worker injuries while also increasing overall
resilience. Providing the appropriate level of HazMat training for all first responders, as well as community
members, will help to better protect local communities, improve response efficacy, reduce recovery time, and
increase resiliency of first responders, as well as the communities they serve. This training will also address
important health and safety challenges facing the first responder community, such as PTSD and suicide, to
help protect the overall health and safety of the workers. The IAFF has been effective in planning,
implementing and operating worker health and safety training programs for more than 30 years. Through this
grant funding, annually the IAFF will deliver: five Frontline Safety classes, 20 IAFF Peer Support Training
classes, 20 IAFF Resilience Training classes, 1,500 web-based Disaster Response Peer Support Training classes,
1,500 web-based IAFF Safety Planning Intervention for Suicide Prevention Training classes, and 10 IAFF
Community HazMat Education classes. During the 5-year grant period, the IAFF will deliver 15,275 classes
and train a minimum of 21,875 workers (instructor led and web-based training combined).
Through this continued cooperative agreement, the IAFF will:
 1. Utilize advanced GIS, collaborative contact databases, hazard risk assessments, and applications of
 demonstrated need to identify and provide the HazMat training programs described above. The IAFF
 remains dedicated to increasing diversity and training of underserved populations.
 2. Improve overall worker health and safety, and increase worker and community resiliency, through the
 delivery of updated curricula that encompasses worker safety (including new strategies to help
 decrease injury and death), behavioral health awareness, opiate/substance abuse disorder, suicide
 prevention, community HazMat awareness.

10850861,"Project title: Neuroprotective Role of Sirt6 in Glaucoma
SUMMARY
Glaucoma is the second leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. It is characterized as progressive
retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death and optic nerve degeneration. Strong risk factors for glaucoma include
elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), age and genetic background. Among them, only IOP is well-studied and
serves as the only treatable target for glaucoma. However, lowering IOP does not always stop the progression
of glaucoma. It is urgent to identify other mechanisms of neuropathy in glaucoma for therapeutic intervention.
Sirtuin (Sirt) 6 is a member of the Sirts that are evolutionarily conserved nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD)-dependent histone deacetylases and share homolog with yeast Sir2 protein that critically regulates
lifespan of yeast. It is a histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) and H3K56 deacetylase which represses the transcription
activities of several transcription factors involved in aging and inflammation, promotes DNA repair, prevents
genomic instability and maintains glucose homeostasis. These multiple functions of Sirt6 position it as a key
anti-aging molecule. Sirt6 is expressed in the retina but its role in glaucoma is unknown. This application will
integrate a series of novel approaches including our newly developed Sirt6 global and conditional knockout
/overexpression mice, AAV2-mediated gene knockdown, clinic-relevant non-invasive imaging and functional
tests, state-of-the-art imaging to test the hypothesis that Sirt6 plays a key role in the prevention of
dysfunction/degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons in glaucoma. We will: 1) test the
hypothesis that loss of Sirt6 causes pathological changes in the retina and optic nerve resembling glaucoma;
2) test the hypothesis that boosting Sirt6 expression prevents pathological changes in the retina and optic
nerve in IOP elevation-induced glaucoma. Completion of the proposed studies will provide important new
knowledge that may guide the development of novel therapies for glaucoma. This proposal is in line with vision
research priorities identified in the NEI Publication, “Vision Research: Needs, Gaps, & Opportunities”: 1)
Determine the mechanisms by which risk factors, such as age and prior glaucomatous injury, influence
susceptibility of remaining RGC axons to elevated IOP; 2) Apply molecular biology techniques to RGC
neuroscience to dissect factors important for survival, axon regeneration, and physiology; 3) Explore
neuroprotection as an approach for prolonging RGC function and survival."
10850862,"Abstract
 Cataract surgery is associated with a high risk of posterior capsule opacification (PCO), a form of secondary
cataract, the formation of which is still poorly understood. However, PCO is generally considered a chronic
disease and a consequence of the LEC fibrotic process, attributed in part to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) in which TGFβ mediated signaling is one of the key players. Recently, we and others have suggested
that canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling is also a pivotal player in LEC fibrosis and the pathogenesis of PCO. To
test the Wnt signaling in chronic conditions, we conducted a 6-month-kinetic rabbit cataract surgery study and
found a profound activation of the canonical Wnt signaling during the course of PCO formation, associated with
elevated oxidation and chronic inflammation. We postulate that lens epithelial cells (LECs) undergo self-
regulatory signaling transduction to adapt to the new microenvironment after cataract surgery, and the canonical
Wnt/β-catenin plays a pivotal role in this process. Our initial study identifies Wnt3 as a highly expressed and
upregulated Wnt-family gene in human and mouse LECs after cataract surgery. However, the role of Wnt3
signaling mediated LEC fibrosis and PCO formation is still unclear; the underlying mechanisms of how lens
epithelial cells regulate the Wnt signaling remain to be addressed. We plan to unravel these puzzles with a basis
of support from several key findings of our pilot studies, e.g., our discovery that LECs package Wnt3 into
exosomes, a type of extracellular vesicle (EVs), and conduct signaling transduction in an endocrine fashion.
Importantly, inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα, can drastically promote exosome biogenesis and Wnt3
secretion. Aim 1 will test how lens epithelial cells regulate Wnt3 packaging and exosome biogenesis. We need
to understand how LECs manage to promote exosome biogenesis and Wnt3 secretion under the certain stimuli,
e.g., inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Aim 2 will delineate the role of Wnt3 in LEC proliferation,
migration, and differentiation using in vitro cell culture, primary cell culture, ex vivo explant culture, and in vivo
mouse models. Aim3 studies the LECs’ growth microenvironment and the Wnt3 mediated autocrine signaling by
using human tissue with and without a history of cataract surgery. Human tissue studies will offer a final
checkpoint of research after studies from cell culture and animal models. In summary, substantial pilot data form
the basis of our proposal, one which will unravel a novel LECs self-regulatory pathway that is closely reminiscent
of the pathological and physiological conditions of cataract surgery."

Adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are known to rely on signals from neighboring microenvironmental cells, such as the endothelial populations. While the role of blood vessels in promoting metastatic progression of solid tumors has been extensively studied, their function in the initiation and progression of early myeloid disorders, such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), is less defined. MDS is characterized by a block in HSC differentiation and progressive bone marrow failure, especially in the elderly. With our ageing population, >10,000 new cases are diagnosed in the US every year. Since many patients with MDS develop aggressive therapy-resistant acute myeloid leukemias (AML), there is a significant need to understand mechanisms promoting MDS progression. Extensive work has shown increased angiogenesis in MDS patient bone marrow biopsies, possibly induced by angiogenic factors secreted by MDS cells. Higher disease burden often correlates with increasing microvascular density. Endothelial niche-driven signals are known to be critical for survival and chemoresistance of AML. These observations indicate a functional role for aberrant angiogenesis in promoting disease progression. However, it is not known when the endothelial niche remodeling initiates during MDS progression, what are the molecular changes that occur within the endothelial cells over time, and if the newly formed blood vessels provide support for disease progression. Based on the extensive remodeling of the endothelial niche in MDS, and the requirement for endothelial niche-driven signals in AML that can develop from MDS, we hypothesize that the altered vascular bone marrow niche provides support for MDS initiation as well as growth and progression of MDS. To test this, we will determine the spatiotemporal changes in the bone marrow endothelial niche and determine the functional role of the altered endothelial cells on MDS progression. In the long term, our work may help in designing novel therapeutic approaches aimed at inhibiting endothelial cell remodeling in MDS."
10838506,"Dysfunction of RNA metabolism has emerged to play crucial roles in multiple neurodegeneration diseases, including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Alzheimer’s Disease related dementias (ADRD), such as frontal temporal dementia (FTD). One pathologic hallmark of these diseases is the nuclear clearance and cytosolic aggregation of the RNA binding protein (RBP) TAR DNA binding protein-43 (TDP-43), which is found in 20-60% AD patients and 50% FTD patients. TDP-43 has multiple functions in mRNA processing. It is also implicated in regulating retrotransposon activation, but the molecular mechanism is not resolved.
Retrotransposon elements are mobile genetic elements that copy themselves by transcribing into RNA, reverse-transcribed into DNA and then inserted into new sites in the genome, a process known as retrotransposition. Long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE1) is the only currently active, autonomous family of retrotransposon elements in human, and accounts for ~20% of the human genome. Only a small subset of LINE1s are thought to be mobile. The majority are inactive due to truncations, rearrangements and point mutations. There are increasing interest in understanding the “noncoding RNA” functions of LINE1 RNA in chromatin state regulation.
In this research project, we will decipher the molecular mechanism of LINE1 RNA dysregulation, particularly the dysfunction of LINE1 RNA decay pathway caused by TDP-43 loss of function, which is associated with the pathology of Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias. We will determine the causal relationship of LINE1 RNA elevation with chromatin accessibility, histone modification and transcriptional gene network disruption. We will combine human induced pluripotent stem cell-differentiated neurons and postmortem tissues from AD and FTD patients to dissect the molecular mechanisms associated with TDP-43 proteiopathy. Our proposed study will provide deeper mechanistic understanding of the retroelement dysregulation in AD/ADRD and its role in functional genomics, which is largely understudied in the past. The findings will help understanding disease mechanisms and facilitating therapy development for Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias."
10827751,"Summary
The primary objective of the 2024 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on New Antibacterial Discovery and
Development (NADD) and its associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) is to address the urgent demand for
new, effective antibacterial drugs. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the potential for infectious diseases to
significantly impact society. Despite the historical success of antibiotics, the increasing prevalence of drug-
resistant bacteria has not diminished the threat they pose. While many conferences focus on a single aspect of
the antibacterial crisis— e.g., virulence mechanisms of specific bacteria, new chemistries enabling novel inhibitor
design, or the use of new drugs in clinical practice, the 2024 GRC on NADD is positioned at the intersection of
basic science, drug development, and government partnerships. It uniquely creates a multi-disciplinary
environment where attendees can define and explore pathways to generate the next generation of safe and
effective antibacterial drugs.
Despite the lessons from COVID-19 and the growing threat of drug-resistant bacteria, large pharmaceutical
companies continue to exit the antibacterial field while small biotechnology companies struggle with unique
economic challenges related to antibacterial commercialization. Meanwhile, much of the excitement in the
infectious diseases space has shifted toward novel vaccine technologies for viral infections. Although these
advances may eventually benefit drug-resistant bacterial infections, they do not diminish the need for innovative,
safe, and effective direct-acting antibacterial drugs. Consequently, fostering a community of scientists dedicated
to innovation and calculated risk-taking in this field is more critical than ever. The 2024 GRC and GRS will offer
opportunities for critical thinking on the latest findings and technological advancements in the field of antibacterial
discovery and, importantly, will allow cross-disciplinary learning from recent challenges and successes in the
ongoing fight against bacterial drug resistance.
Previous GRCs on NADD have fostered a collaborative atmosphere in a typically competitive scientific
landscape. Building on this tradition, the 2024 GRC and GRS will focus on three main areas: 1) exploring new
technologies to identify new druggable targets, novel inhibitors, and approaches to improve target accessibility,
2) identifying challenges and solutions for progressing molecules from proof-of-concept hits to bonafide lead
molecules or development candidates, and 3) learning from recent clinical successes and setbacks.
The ultimate goal of the 2024 GRC and GRS is to establish and maintain a scientific ecosystem with expertise
covering the entire spectrum of the antibacterial discovery and development process. By cultivating such
communities, we can ensure that the next generation of antibacterial medicines will be available to address the
growing threat of drug-resistant bacteria."

Project Summary/Abstract
The vascular biology field is undergoing a transformation as new technological developments and discoveries
are revealing the extent and mechanisms of vascular diversity. Vascular biologists have a growing appreciation
for how vessel structure and function can vary in different organs, developmental stages, sexes, and disease
contexts and how this variation can impact therapeutic strategies for tackling a wide range of pathologies. Two
important factors that contribute to vascular diversity are (1) the genetic patterning of developing vessels, and
(2) the surrounding environment in which vessels grow and adapt. Vascular Biology 2024 (VB2024) will
provide a forum for in-depth exploration of these factors by covering the themes of (1) development and
genetics, (2) matrix biology and bioengineering, (3) signaling and (4) inflammation. The combination of these
four themes fosters exciting opportunities for vascular biologists with diverse expertise to collaborate and make
discoveries. In addition, VB2024 will host the Microcirculatory Society (MCS) as its guest. The MCS brings
classical expertise in microcirculatory physiology and function, and benefits the molecular, genetic, and
bioengineering approaches of NAVBO meeting participants, and vice versa. Overall, VB2024 aims to bring
together scientists focused on developmental, genetic, matrix, bioengineering, signaling, inflammation and
microcirculatory aspects of the vasculature so that their cross-fertilization can progress the field's
understanding of vascular development, diversity, and therapeutic potential.
VB2024 will be an international meeting that draws researchers from academia, industry, and government and
incorporates both trainees and established scientists. The meeting will be held at the Asilomar Conference
Grounds, from October 20-24, 2024. The roster of organizers and invited speakers provides a diverse and
inclusive face to the meeting, with women, junior faculty, and individuals from underrepresented groups
featured. In addition, a large number of speakers will be selected from abstract submissions to give trainees
and junior faculty additional opportunities to present their research and to promote diverse voices. The meeting
will include 14 concurrent sessions across the five main topics and two cross-over themes on malformations
and mechanotransduction. Keynote, NAVBO and MCS award lectures and the sessions on Metabolism,
Vascular Malformations, and Microvascular Changes During Pregnancy are general sessions that will unify all
meeting participants in one room. Additional opportunities for formal and informal interactions will occur at
poster sessions, group meals, nano-talks, and a conference-wide reception on opening night. Altogether,
VB2024 will serve as a nexus for scientists of diverse career stages, backgrounds, and perspectives to come
together for four days of intensive discussion and interaction that will foster new ideas and collaborations to
advance the field of vascular biology and will highlight potential areas of therapeutic opportunities to promote
the NHLBI mission."
10828267,"IMAT R61 Abstract
In addition to its well-recognized roles in neuronal computation and cardiac contractions, the voltage across the
plasma membrane has been implicated as a fundamental regulator of differentiation and proliferation. The
concurrent regulation of proliferation and stem cell states by membrane voltage contributes to normal tissue
morphogenesis, development, and diseases such as cancer. Membrane hyperpolarization tends to promote
increased differentiation and reduced proliferation while depolarization is associated with immature and
proliferative stem-like cell states. Of clinical relevance, cancer cells and cancer stem-like cells exhibit depolarized
membrane voltage values compared with the normal differentiated cells from which they arise. Despite the
strong association between voltage and cancer cell phenotypes, voltage modulation has not been effectively
exploited as a drug target against cancer, largely reflecting the technological challenges with membrane voltage
measurements in physiologically relevant contexts. Current techniques to measure membrane voltage, including
electrode arrays and voltage sensitive dyes, have limitations in the number of experimental observations
possible, compatibility with complementary phenotypic readouts, the duration of sampling, and the inability to
perform longitudinal cell analyses. These technologic challenges motivate our hypothesis that integration of
genetically encoded voltage and cell cycle sensors will provide a robust and novel high-throughput platform to
identify modulators of membrane voltage and cell proliferation. We propose to develop, optimize, and validate
a cell-based technology platform integrating JEDI, a novel voltage indicator, and FUCCI cell-cycle sensors to
enable real time high-throughput analysis of concurrent changes in voltage and cell proliferation in living cells.
To build the platform, we propose to demonstrate high-throughput imaging of voltage dynamics (Aim 1) and cell
cycle states (Aim 2) in glioblastoma stem cells. We next propose to deploy these technologies for high-throughput
quantification of the impact of ion channel-modulating drugs on the membrane voltage and cell-cycle changes
(Aim 3). This novel platform is expected, for the first time, to provide a tool for real-time live cell readouts of
concurrent changes in membrane voltage and cell proliferation. Besides its implications for the treatment of
cancer, we anticipate this platform to have far reaching basic science and clinical translational applications in
neuroscience, stem cell and iPSC biology, cell-based therapies, and cardiovascular diseases."

The Pharmacological Sciences Training Program, renamed the Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology
(CMP) training program in this new submission, is one of the oldest and largest pharmacology training
programs in the nation. The program provides a specific set of skills and a strong identification with the
field of Pharmacology to students entering through the umbrella Biomedical Sciences (BMS) Program at
UCSD. The training program is associated with one of the premier Departments of Pharmacology, whose
faculty are highly funded, dedicated to graduate education, and trained and experienced mentors. Junior
faculty and those from other UCSD departments and the Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical
Sciences complement the list of Pharmacology Department training mentors to provide diverse and
interdisciplinary research opportunities. Students join the CMP Training Program at the beginning of their
second year of graduate work, having taken the first year of required BMS didactic courses and seminars
that cover a broad range of state-of-the-art research areas, and emphasize presentation and
communication skills, quantitative skills, ethics, and rigor and reproducibility. The entire class of first year
BMS students (~30 training grant eligible students) are invited to apply to the CMP training program and
many do so because of the excellent reputation of the program and its faculty. At present there are 38
students in the CMP training program, with 7-8 students entering each year and supported for two years,
corresponding to the requested 15 training grant slots per year. Once in the program, the students become
a highly cohesive group through their interactions in additional CMP-specific classes and interdisciplinary
training experiences. These include an introductory workshop in the Fundamentals of Rigor and
Reproducibility, two courses in Drugs and Disease, computational and/or quantitative courses, a biannual
Careers course, a student organized journal club, attendance and participation in the weekly Research
Discussion presentations, and a yearly retreat focused in large part on the trainees. Through these
activities, the program seeks to build a diverse pool of rigorously trained scientists, with the skills required
for leadership roles in areas of biomedical science where training in the fundamental discipline of
pharmacology impacts basic research, drug discovery, public policy and education. Intended and realized
outcomes, evidenced by those of our extensive pool of alumni, include positions in the pharmaceutical and
biotech industry, in government and regulatory affairs, in public policy and secondary education, in law,
and in biomedical and pharmacology education. Critical and independent thinking that pushes the
boundaries of pharmacological science is emphasized and recognized through a variety of awards to
students and alumni. Importantly, we model inclusiveness through the significant fraction of training faculty
and trainees who are URMs and women."
10828829,"Abstract
The research in our laboratory centers on foundational mechanisms that regulate eukaryotic gene expression.
In particular, we are interested in roles played by small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) and histone post-
translational modifications (PTMs) in the transmission of genetic and epigenetic information required for proper
metazoan development and genome function. We have developed innovative model systems in Drosophila
melanogaster to study gene regulation and neuromuscular disease. Critically, these models allow direct
interrogation of specific residues present within conserved genes and multi-gene families. For example, we can
now study the biological function of a specific histone PTM by changing the acceptor residue to an amino acid
that cannot be appropriately modified and then replacing all wild-type copies of a given histone gene with mutant
copies. This approach is not possible in other animal models. Hence, for the first time in any multicellular
eukaryote, we can now directly determine the extent to which a given histone PTM contributes to cell fate and
organismal development. Similarly, we generated an allelic series of animals that express missense mutations
in the Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) gene that are derived from human Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) patients.
This series represents the largest number of SMA-causing point mutants currently available in any model
organism. Several of these alleles serve as separation-of-function mutations that uncouple the putative
housekeeping and tissue-specific activities of SMN, enabling us to study these processes independently. We
employ genome-wide techniques together with molecular genetics and biochemistry to identify cellular pathways
and binding partners that are dysregulated in human cancer and neuromuscular disease. Using these two
powerful genetic platforms, we expect to identify factors and mechanisms that enable a specific chromatin mark
to modulate the expression of an individual transcript or an entire chromosome, as well as those that carry out
the assembly and maturation of spliceosomal and messenger RNPs."
10828728,"Abstract
Type 2 diabetes and cardiac arrhythmias are both highly prevalent in older age. There is growing awareness
that diabetes affects the electrical conduction system in the heart. Asymptomatic arrhythmias are thought to be
particularly common in older adults, especially in the setting of diabetes. Many of these arrhythmias are
thought to be harmful, but their impact on cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in older adults with diabetes
is not clear. Prior research has shown that glycemic variability and hypoglycemia in diabetes contribute to a
high burden of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. However, prior studies have not collected concomitant
information on glucose patterns and ECG recordings. We contend the glycemic patterns (low, high, and
variable glucose) may acutely contribute to cardiac arrhythmias in diabetes. To address this question, we will
conduct continuous glucose monitoring and leadless “patch” ECG monitoring in a population of adults with
diabetes aged 60 years and older to assess coinciding variations in glycemia and cardiac rhythm. We will
relate these patterns to current health status and long-term clinical outcomes. Our research will inform the role
of low, high, and variable glucose in leading to cardiac arrhythmias and subsequent outcomes in older adults
with diabetes."
10828887,"PROJECT SUMMARY.
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) persists as a costly public health problem that lacks widely effective medications.
The scientific premise of the proposed research is that brain receptors for the nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide
(NOP) are promising targets for new medications, but translational studies in sophisticated nonhuman primate
(NHP) models are needed to inform and direct drug development and clinical testing. This premise is based on
encouraging data from rodent models and positive preliminary data from our NHP laboratory using
buprenorphine and its derivative BU08028, termed a “bifunctional” MOP/NOP agonist because it stimulates
both NOP and mu opioid peptide (MOP) receptors. The proposed studies combine a well-characterized,
clinically relevant NHP model of chronic ethanol (EtOH) drinking, novel NOP- and MOP/NOP-acting drugs, a
translational method of pharmacotherapy assessment and noninvasive brain imaging using positron emission
tomography (PET imaging). After being induced to drink EtOH using established procedures, male and female
rhesus monkeys will have free access to EtOH; responding to receive food pellets will also be monitored as an
index of potential side effects. Specific Aim 1 will determine the effects of buprenorphine and its derivative
BU08028, in combination with drugs that selectively stimulate or block MOP or NOP receptors. The results will
reveal the relative contribution of MOP and NOP receptor stimulation to the ability of bifunctional agonists to
decrease EtOH drinking, indicating the ideal pharmacological profile for a medication. Next (Aim 2), drugs that
possess the desired profile will be selected from among a catalog of novel compounds synthesized by Co-
Investigator Dr. Stephen Husbands. Candidates will be administered daily for several months and effects on
moderate and heavy drinking (6 or 22 hours per day, respectively) will be determined using a translational
approach developed by the P.I. We expect to identify a compound that produces prolonged suppression of
EtOH drinking without altering food-maintained responding or producing adverse effects. Aim 3 consists of
PET imaging studies using the novel radiotracer [11C]NOP-1A that run parallel to Aims 1 and 2. These studies
will characterize (1) the influence of basal NOP receptor availability on initial sensitivity to EtOH, (2) the effects
of long-term EtOH drinking on NOP receptors, (3) the effects of efficacious treatments on NOP receptor
availability, (4) the extent of recovery of NOP receptor availability during abstinence from EtOH and,
importantly, (5) sex differences in all these measures. Together, the results of these studies will provide novel,
translational data to support the feasibility and efficacy of developing MOP/NOP and NOP-selective agonists
as novel AUD pharmacotherapies using translational, clinically relevant NHP models."

 Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a life-threatening birth defect that accounts for 8% of all major
congenital anomalies. In cases where CDH co-occurs with cardiovascular malformations (CVMs), mortality
rates increase from 30 to 60%, and long-term morbidity is common. Our goal is to identify genes that cause
CDH and CDH/CVM, and to discover the mechanism by which they control diaphragm and heart development.
 Correctly identifying genes that contribute to specific phenotypes from the large list of candidate genes
data generated in research and clinical studies is a major obstacle to progress in this and other research fields.
In Specific Aim #1, we will address this challenge by generating ranked CDH and CDH/CVM pathogenicity
scores for all RefSeq genes using a machine-learning algorithm that integrates data from large-scale genomic
knowledge sources. We will use these scores to identify novel CDH and CDH/CVM genes from cytogenetically
defined critical regions and form large next-generation sequencing databases as part of our multifaceted
approach to novel gene discovery. We will also accelerate the pace at which human disease genes are
discovered by making these scores and our machine-learning algorithm freely available.
 8p23.1 microdeletions that encompass GATA4 and SOX7 are among the most frequently identified causes
of CDH/CVM. In RNA-seq studies, we identified several CDH-associated genes that are dysregulated in the
E15.5 diaphragms of Gata4flox/flox;Prx1-Cre embryos. These embryos are an ideal model of the sac hernias that
comprise 20% of human CDH cases. In Specific Aim #2, we will combine data from RNA-seq and BioChIP-seq
analyses with the priority scores generated in Aim #1 to identify primary GATA4 target genes whose
dysregulation contribute to the development of sac CDH. We will then determine if alterations in the expression
of these target genes can cause CDH, or can modify the CDH phenotypes of GATA4-deficient mice.
 We have shown that SOX7 deficiency causes septal defects by decreasing endothelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) in the developing heart. In RNA-seq and in situ hybridization studies we have shown that the
expression of Wnt4—a key regulator of EMT in the endocardium—is severely decreased in E9.5 Sox7-/- hearts.
In Specific Aim #3 we will determine if Wnt4 is a primary target of SOX7, and whether modulation of WNT4 or
its downstream effectors can rescue SOX7-related cardiac phenotypes.
 Several lines of evidence suggset that WNT4 is a novel CDH/CVM gene in humans. To confirm this
association, and learn more about the role of WNT4 in diaphragm and heart development, we will determine if
WNT4 deficiency causes CDH/CVM in mice, if Sox7 and Wnt4 interact genetically in the development of
CDH/CVM and if SOX7 regulates Wnt4 transcripition in the developing diaphragm.
 Through these studies we will identify novel CDH and CDH/CVM genes and pathways. The bioinformatic
tools we develop in this grant will enhance gene discovery efforts across multiple research fields."
10828892,"Our goal is to understand the mechanisms of cell type- and stimulus-specific regulation of the
human TNF gene and the TNF/LT locus genes (LTA and LTB) in T cells and monocytes/macrophages and
to identify genomic regions that could potentially be targeted in TNF-driven disease states. Using unbiased
next generation sequencing (NGS) approaches and CRISPR editing of human cells and mice, we will
identify and elucidate function of transcriptional regulatory elements that modulate TNF, LTA, and LTB gene
expression in T cells and monocytes/macrophages during activation and differentiation conditions and
infectious challenges. Our preliminary studies using the NGS approaches of stranded RNA-, ATAC-, and
HINT-seq reveal multiple novel highly conserved non-coding elements that transcribe eRNA in a cell type-
specific manner in naïve T cells and in human monocytes/macrophages. They also show the cell type-
specific hHS-8 enhancer that controls IFN-γ priming in monocytes/macrophages and enhances TNF and
LTA in activated T cells we previously described. Our first goal will be to define the transcriptional territories
and potential intrachromosomal interactions between the novel elements and hHS-8 with the TNF, LTA, and
LTB genes. We will use ChIP-seq to determine the recruitment of the architectural protein CTCF, which
mediates chromatin conformation, and the enrichment of H3K27Ac and H3K24Me, which are associated
with enhancers. To select high potential regulatory areas this data will also be evaluated by a phylogenetic
analysis of the TNF/LT locus in non-human primates to define highly conserved regions that predict
regulatory function. These studies will guide our 3-dimensional analysis of locus architecture with Hi-C and
CRISPR deletion of potential regulatory elements in cell lines and primary cells to establish their function.
These studies then will provide a powerful framework and data set from which to interrogate these sites and
new regulatory elements we will uncover in our analyses of (i) different states of human T cell and
macrophage differentiation stimulated with TCR ligands or LPS and/or IFN-γ, respectively; (ii) the TNF/LT
locus in primary T cells and BMDM from C57BL/6 and Balb/c mouse strains to evaluate concordance
between the regulation of the murine and human TNF/LT loci as a baseline for performing studies in
CRISPR-edited mice and testing the role of elements in acute (sepsis) and chronic (arthritis) TNF-mediated
disease models. We will also characterize the role of distal elements that regulate TNF and the IL-6 gene
expression, which shares regulatory similarities with TNF during infection with M. tuberculosis (MTb) or
RNA viruses (Sendai and SARS-CoV-2), to elucidate broader gene expression programs. We anticipate
that these studies will lead to a new understanding of how the TNF/LT genes are coordinately regulated,
provide fundamental insights into gene regulation and the role of distal elements, and provide potential
genomic targets to regulate TNF in a cell type-and inducer-specific manner in disease states."
10829477,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Social deficits are a prominent feature of autism spectrum disorder and many other
neuropsychiatric diseases. Since there are currently no drugs available to treat these debilitating
symptoms, it is critical to decipher the neuronal mechanisms underlying social behavior and their
impairments in mental illnesses. Oxytocin, first discovered as a hormone that strengthens
contractions during labor and facilitates lactation, has subsequently been found to have a critical
role as a neuromodulator regulating social behavior. Recent work has begun to clarify how
oxytocin acts on neuronal circuits to modify inter-neuronal communication and circuit properties.
However, there is a large gap in the understanding of the intracellular signaling pathways that are
activated by oxytocin acting on its receptor in neurons. In particular, the regulatory mechanisms
that control oxytocin receptor signaling in neurons remain unexplored. Our preliminary findings
suggest robust and rapid-onset desensitization of oxytocin receptor response in multiple regions
of the mouse brain. Here, we propose to investigate the molecular mechanisms and behavioral
role of this process in the brain. Based on our generation of novel oxytocin receptor mutants that
do not undergo desensitization, we will characterize the molecular determinants that control
oxytocin-induced recruitment of the desensitizing machinery, G protein coupling and receptor
internalization in neurons and the brain. The behavioral role of oxytocin receptor desensitization
in controlling social behaviors will be tested by replacing endogenous oxytocin receptor in specific
brain regions with non-desensitizing mutants using CRISPR-Cas9 technique and virus delivery.
In addition, this proposal will dissect the inhibitory effect of a novel protein complex that we
identified in our proteomics experiments to associate with oxytocin receptor in neurons. The
investigations proposed here will provide a comprehensive test of our overall hypothesis that
neuronal oxytocin receptor is under tight regulatory control of receptor desensitization that limits
its signaling and that inhibiting this process would enhance oxytocin signaling and oxytocin-
dependent social behaviors. Completion of this work will provide deep insights into regulatory
mechanisms governing an important G protein-coupled receptor in the brain and may uncover
novel targets for the future development of therapeutic agents that alleviate social deficits in
neuropsychiatric disorders."

10840116,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Environmental exposures heavily influence human health. To gain more precise insight into environmental
exposures' effects on health, scientists must integrate and assimilate sensor data and other types of research
data across domains and varied temporal and spatial scales. However, we lack informatics tools that enable
researchers to share, find, assess, and re-use environmental data sources. The central problem is the lack of
associated metadata that enables appropriate use and re-use. There is a lack of consensus on metadata
standards and conceptual models representing the exposure domain. Investigators and curators of real-world
data collections are often not incentivized or responsible for metadata discovery for data re-use. Moreover, we
lack accessible tools that enable scientists to discover, harmonize, store, and publish metadata. In prior work,
we developed the Exposure Health Informatics Ecosystem (EHIE), a scalable, standards-based, open-source
informatics infrastructure. EHIE supports semantically consistent, metadata-driven, event-based management
of exposure data for research. Here, we propose to leverage our expertise in metadata and event-based
modeling to advance methods for exposure health research entailing sensors. In aim 1, we will develop a
logical model for representing diverse types of sensor metadata, and in doing so, discover and harmonize
sensor and device metadata in a community-driven approach. In aim 2, we design and evaluate a user-facing
metadata repository that will encompass a library of data, sensors/ devices, and interfaces that support
metadata submission and browsing. In aim 3, we will develop specifications, logical models, and the functions
needed to transform any exposure health data into an event-based format, enhanced with spatial and temporal
coordinates. In aim 4, we will develop prototype workflows that research teams can use as models for using
the tools we create to generated metadata-enhanced, semantically consistent exposure health data. Across
these four aims, we engage the environmental exposure health research community through an expert panel,
user-centered design, public comment, and a communications plan. This effort builds upon prior research and
development efforts of an experienced informatics team in conjunction with the University of Utah's Center of
Excellence in Exposure Health Informatics. The expected outcome is the development of community-driven,
shared, and generalizable tools for metadata and data management, supporting reproducible environmental
exposure health research."

transformation of the field of muscle and movement sciences by providing support and access to approaches
from biology, engineering, and computing, that will lead a new understanding of multi-scale muscle biophysics

underpinnings of muscle development and aging, physiologic structure-function, disease-mediated dysfunction,
and the systemic impact of muscle behavior and plasticity. Core D will provide invaluable multi-scale
computational tools and visualization platforms to be used in research on metabolism (energy supply) and

10842279,"Schizophrenia affects approximately 1.1% of the population, or approximately 3.5 million Americans. The life expectancy
of persons with schizophrenia is 10-25 years less than that of the general population, and has not improved in recent
decades. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and ventricular arrhythmia (VA), which account for 8-10% of all deaths in this
population, is three times as common among those with than without schizophrenia. The most clearly established risk
factor for SCA/VA in persons with schizophrenia is the use of antipsychotic agents, and this risk is dose-dependent.
Second-generation antipsychotic agents (SGAs) are the most common treatment for schizophrenia, and are also used for
other common mental health conditions including bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and psychosis/agitation
associated with dementia. The prevalence of current antipsychotic drug use in US adults is 1.6%, or 3.8 million adults. A
recent meta-analysis found that several widely used SGAs are associated with an elevated risk of SCA/VA. Given the high
prevalence of polypharmacy in persons with schizophrenia and other mental health conditions, and the high potential
for drug interactions in persons taking SGAs, clinicians badly need evidence-based guidance on which drugs do and do
not increase the risk of SCA/VA in persons taking specific SGAs. Unfortunately, almost all available evidence about the
health effects of potential DDIs involving SGAs comes from either 1) spontaneously reported adverse drug events, which
provide limited evidence for causation because of their anecdotal nature, or from 2) pharmacokinetic studies of serum
concentrations of SGAs, which include few subjects and do not examine health end-points. A more rigorous approach to
identifying and elucidating drug interactions will help to identify drug-drug pairs that truly increase the risk of SCA/VA,
and improve the safety of pharmacotherapy provided to persons with schizophrenia and other mental health conditions.
To address these critical knowledge gaps about which drugs should and should not be avoided in persons receiving
commonly used second generation antipsychotic drugs, we will perform high-throughput pharmacoepidemiology
screening to identify drugs that may increase the rate of out-of-hospital SCA/VA in persons taking commonly used
second-generation antipsychotic agents. Then, in two independent validation populations, we will conduct hypothesis-
driven etiologic pharmacoepidemiology studies to either confirm or refute high-priority potential drug interactions, and
elucidate factors that place patients at increased risk of out-of-hospital SCA/VA associated with specific drug pairs. The
results of this research will provide drug interaction compendia editors with valid, actionable evidence that will allow
them to warn clinicians about truly risky drug combinations. Of equal importance, this research will allow clinicians to be
relieved of unnecessary and burdensome alerts about drug combinations that can actually be administered safely. We
further propose to enhance the impact of our research by disseminating key findings through our ongoing series of
webinars, newsletters, and videos that we produce for our established stakeholder group of editors and curators of drug
interaction compendia and computerized decision support systems."
10842280,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In the United States, declines in cardiovascular mortality have stalled, and there is growing concern that these
population-level trends may reflect an increase in the burden of cardiovascular risk factors and disease in low-
income working-age adults (18 to 64 years). However, these patterns have not been well characterized on a
national scale. The COVID-19 pandemic has only magnified the critical need to track the cardiovascular health
of the low-income working-age population. The pandemic has led to substantial disruptions in health care, and
created enormous spillover effects, including unemployment and deepening financial hardship, which have
fallen more heavily on low-income adults. These changes may widen inequities in health insurance coverage,
health care access, and affordability, and ultimately, worsen cardiovascular health for years to come. In the
wake of the pandemic, policymakers are now weighing whether to expand the Medicare program to increase
access to health care. Understanding the potential effects of this policy change on the cardiovascular health of
low-income adults could inform federal strategies to improve health equity nationwide. Building on our team’s
expertise in the linkage and analysis of large datasets, the application of epidemiological and
econometric methods, and the evaluation of health policies, we will examine changes in cardiovascular
risk factors, disease, and outcomes in low-income working-age adults, assess the impact of the
pandemic on health care coverage, access, and affordability as well as cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality, and determine the potential effects of expanding Medicare on the cardiovascular health of
this population. To do so, we will use a unique combination of national survey data, state all-payer and
national Medicaid claims, and CDC epidemiological data. In Aim 1, we will perform a national analysis that
determines whether the prevalence, treatment, and control of cardiovascular risk factors, incidence of acute
cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular mortality were increasing in low-income working-age adults prior to
the pandemic. In Aim 2, we will examine whether the pandemic was associated with short- and long-term
changes in health care coverage, access, and affordability, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and self-
reported health in low-income working-age adults using interrupted time series analyses. In Aim 3, we will
evaluate the effects of Medicare on health care access and affordability, the screening, treatment and control
of cardiovascular risk factors, and self-reported health in low-income adults using quasi-experimental
approaches. This research will advance our understanding of changes in cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality among low-income working-age adults, before and after the pandemic, and provide critical insights on
the implications of expanding Medicare on health care access, affordability, and cardiovascular health for this
population. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the US, and our work will ultimately
inform public health and policy strategies to improve cardiovascular outcomes – and equity – nationwide."
10842397,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human morbidity and mortality due to bacterial infections continue to remain significant public health concern.
Group B Streptococcus (GBS) or Streptococcus agalactiae cause invasive infections during pregnancy
leading to preterm births, stillbirths or infections in newborns. Furthermore, GBS also cause infections in the
normal, elderly, diabetic and immuno-compromised adults. Our work has shown that the hemolysin, which is
a key virulence factor for GBS infections is a pigmented ornithine rhamnolipid also known as granadaene.
This hemolytic lipid toxin is cytotoxic to a number of host cells leading to adverse outcomes to newborns and
adult humans. The objectives of this proposal are to identify additional nontoxic analogs that can prevent toxin
function during GBS infections using murine models of infection, to elucidate host immune mechanisms
important for analog mediated immunity against this GBS toxin, to determine how membrane vesicles
exacerbate GBS pathogenesis and if antibodies can attenuate their effects. Collectively, the results from these
aims will be important and relevant for prevention of GBS infections in humans and will be relevant to other
diseases caused by pathogens encoding toxic lipids."
10842398,"Ant1 is the muscle/heart/central nervous system (CNS) isoform of adenine nucleotide translocase that is
primarily involved in ATP/ADP exchange across the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). An increasing
number of missense mutations in Ant1 are found to cause dominant diseases that affect skeletal muscle and
the central nervous system. These diseases are commonly manifested by fractional mtDNA deletions and mild
bioenergetic defects. The mechanism of neuromuscular damage in the diseases is poorly understood.
Interestingly, our recent studies in yeast and cultured human cells suggested that the mutant Ant1 is misfolded.
This leads to cell death by a novel mechanism that we named mitochondrial Precursor Overaccumulation
Stress (mPOS). mPOS is characterized by the toxic accumulation and aggregation of un-imported
mitochondrial preproteins in the cytosol. These findings led to the central hypothesis that the mutant Ant1
primarily affects mitochondrial protein import. This results in mPOS in the cytosol, which plays an important
role in inducing neural and muscular degeneration. Fractional mtDNA deletions occur independent of
nucleotide transport activity, likely as a secondary damage collateral to reduced mitochondrial protein import.
In this application, we propose to directly test this hypothesis in mouse models. We successfully generated
knock-in (KI) mouse lines expressing misfolded variants of Ant1. Preliminary studies indicated that these mice
develop phenotypes consistent with neural and muscular degeneration. In Specific Aim 1, we will use these
unique experimental models to test the hypothesis that misfolded Ant1 induces neural and muscular
degeneration and mtDNA instability independent of nucleotide transport. In Specific Aim 2, we will use various
experimental tools that we developed in yeast, cultured human cells and the Ant1-KI mice to test the
hypothesis that the misfolded Ant1 (or Aac2 in yeast) causes structural and functional damage to the
mitochondrial protein import machinery and induces mPOS in the cytosol. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine
the mechanisms that protect cells against Ant1-induced protein import stress and mPOS. Success of the
project will establish a mouse model of protein import stress associated with mPOS. Particularly, validation of
the mPOS model would help reconciling the mitochondrial and proteostatic pathways in many neural and
muscular degenerative diseases. Finally, the results could have important implications for the understanding
and therapy of Ant1-induced diseases, as well as many other clinical conditions that directly or indirectly affect
mitochondrial protein import."

An epidemiological shift from infectious to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) has led to a dramatic increase
in mortality and disability over the past several decades. This has been attributed in part to important changes
in lifestyles and diets, which have been described as the epidemiologic transition. Cardiometabolic risk factors,
which increase the risk of and promote onset of CVD, include a combination of metabolic dysfunctions
primarily characterized by hypertension, insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, and
central adiposity. This crisis has led to a call for strategic investment in research including regional
development, networking across countries, and expanding cross-sectoral partnerships to improve translation,
innovation and patient care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In this D43 Training Application to
Fogarty International Center, the University of Washington (UW) Department of Global Health will collaborate
with two long-standing partners in Nepal and Kenya to address cardiometabolic diseases and risk factors
through rigorous educational programs, strong mentorship and relevant research experiences. This
collaboration brings together Kathmandu University (KU), with an emerging capacity to address CVD
as a national priority, and University of Nairobi (UON), which has successfully implemented multiple
international training programs, to provide a synergistic approach for empowering the next generation
of researchers to address NCDs in these low resource settings. Specific aims of this program are: 1)
Increase high-impact research on cardiometabolic disease and risk factors by building research capacity at
Kathmandu University (KU) and University of Nairobi (UN) through Master's level degree training to include 6
clinician-researchers, 3 each from Nepal and Kenya, to study and receive UW MPH degrees; 2) Support the
training of 6 students to complete an MS degree in Public Heath from KU with courses offered by D43 faculty;
and 3) Provide mid- and short-term training in Kenya and Nepal focusing on essential research and leadership
skills including a one-year certificate program using on-line distance learning resulting in culminating projects,
and in-country workshops offered by UW, KU and UON Core faculty. Conferences that bring together
members of the NCD community with KU and UON researchers and county health directors will be offered to
promote community engagement in local care, treatment and prevention in both LMICs. Using UW's well-
established approaches to training, this program will establish greatly needed implementation science research
capacity at KU and UON and contribute to changing the face of the NCD epidemic in LMICs."
10843109,"Project Summary
Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy characterized by extensive structural and numerical
chromosomal abnormalities. By comparing consecutive gene expression profiles (GEP) of samples at
baseline, during intensive chemotherapy and at relapse, we have identified chromosomal instability (CIN)
genes associated with poor prognosis in MM disease. One of the CIN genes, the serine-threonine kinase
NEK2, is the most significantly upregulated gene in myeloma cells in patients in complete remission (CR) with
minimal residual disease (MRD) and at relapse early during chemotherapy following tandem transplantations.
We have shown that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of NEK2 delays tumor growth and induces cell
apoptosis in myeloma and high expression of NEK2 has also been related to poor outcomes in many other
cancers. The deubiquitinase (DUB) USP7 stabilizes NEK2 protein resulting in the activation of the NF-
B/heparanase pathway, also involved in bone destruction. However, it is unknown whether NEK2 also
activates USP7. In addition, we have found that NEK2 negatively regulates PD-L1 expression, most likely via
epigenetic modification. High-risk myeloma cells show low levels of PD-L1 expression and are resistant to
immune checkpoint blockade. Therefore, we hypothesize that NEK2 promotes myeloma cell survival, drug
resistance, and disease progression by activating the deubiquitinase USP7 and the histone methyltransferase
EZH2. In order to rigorously test this hypothesis, we will: (1) Identify the major deubiquitination targets
regulated by the Nek2-Usp7 complex using Nek2-transgenic mice with varying levels of Nek2 expression and
controls. We will focus on selecting probable proteins as a proof-of-principle to establish the role of Usp7 as
the signaling hub in this complex. (2) Determine the mechanisms by which NEK2 inhibits responses to immune
checkpoint blockade in myeloma cells using Nek2-knockout mice and biochemical approaches. And, (3)
Develop novel immune therapies for drug-resistant and relapsed myelomas using primary myeloma cells, a
genetic Nek2-knockout mouse model, and a myeloma mouse model. Supported by strong preliminary data that
provide strong rationale for this application, the proposed research is poised to facilitate novel, targeted
approaches to the prevention and treatment of myeloma progression and relapse. We predict that our results
will extend beyond myeloma and also apply to other hematological and solid tumors."

The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) has been a leader in mammalian genetics research and education since its
inception in 1929. JAX pioneered the development of genetic approaches toward understanding fundamental
questions in mammalian development and the genetic underpinnings of human disease. JAX also has a long
and illustrious track record of training postdoctoral, and more recently predoctoral scholars, to be productive
researchers at the nexus of systems genetics, genomics and computational biology. To support JAX's dual
mission of discovery and education, we continually strive to provide cutting-edge, unique, and highly relevant
training opportunities designed to prepare all JAX trainees for successful scientific careers.
 An NIA T32–funded Training Program in Precision Genetics of Aging and Dementia (PGAD) would
provide high-quality graduate and postdoctoral training to prepare its trainees for careers as independent
investigators in universities, research institutions and the biomedical industry. It would bring together 16 highly
productive and well-funded faculty mentors at the JAX Mammalian Genetics campus in Bar Harbor, ME and the
JAX Genomic Medicine campus in Farmington, CT who provide a uniquely interdisciplinary, integrated and
comprehensive training environment. Research foci within the context of aging and age-related disease include
mammalian genetics, hematology, vascular biology, immunology, nephrology, neurology, behavior, microbiome,
systems genetics, and bioinformatics.
 We seek to provide two slots for postdoctoral fellows, and request support for two predoctoral students.
JAX participates in collaborative Ph.D. training programs with the Tufts School of Medicine, the University of
Maine, and the University of Connecticut that have grown to critical mass. Specific criteria are used to admit both
pre- and postdoctoral trainees into the program. Required and elective curricula have been developed to enrich
the training experience. Trainees will test hypotheses regarding the genetic underpinnings of aging and disease,
and will model new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, using cutting-edge computational and mouse genetics
resources uniquely available to them at JAX. Trainees will have access to focused and individualized career
development opportunities, such as teaching and grant writing experiences, and will be integrated into seminars,
workshops, and research interest groups. They will write external funding applications, present their findings at
scientific meetings, and publish in peer-reviewed journals. Trainee evaluation will be rigorous and coupled with
support for growth. The program will thus provide exceptional research opportunities in a stimulating scientific
training environment and enable trainees to launch successful independent careers in biomedical research."
10843227,"Project Summary:
Oncogene mutations frequently drive malignant transformation through inappropriate activation of regulatory
kinases, and inhibitors that disrupt oncogenic phosphorylation have transformed care for subsets of cancer
patients. Despite these successes, kinases are a small fraction of known oncogenes. In particular, several
transcriptional factor oncogenes are essential for tumor initiation, progression and maintenance. In a few cases,
targeting transcription factor oncogenes, such as estrogen, androgen and retinoic acid receptors, has led to
clinically meaningful responses. However, direct targeting of most transcription factors has proven challenging.
An alternative approach to directly targeting oncogenic transcription factors is to inhibit upstream epigenetic
mechanisms regulating chromatin state. Indeed, many epigenetic regulators are recurrently somatically mutated,
and several small molecules targeting chromatin regulators have been shown to abrogate tumor growth. In
preliminary studies, we performed a gene expression-based screen to identify small molecules that inhibit the
activity of TMPRSS2-ERG, a fusion oncogene leading to aberrant transcription in prostate cancer, and identified
BRD4683, a highly potent inhibitor of p300 and CREB binding protein (CBP) histone acetyl transferase (HAT)
activity. We have solved the structure of BRD4683 in complex with p300 and confirmed that inhibition of
p300/CBP HAT activity is specifically required for survival of transcription factor-driven human cancer cell lines.
Despite serving as a useful tool compound, BRD4683 has several chemical liabilities that limit its potential for
drug development.
 We thus used BRD4683 to develop and validate a high-throughput and cost-effective biochemical screen
for discovery of additional novel small molecule p300/CBP HAT inhibitors as well as a cascade of follow up-
assays to eliminate false positives and prioritize chemically tractable molecules. In this project, we propose to
identify new p300/CBP inhibitors and to systematically identify tumor subtypes dependent on combined
p300/CBP HAT activity. In Aim 1, we will perform a high throughput biochemical screen of more than 800,000
compounds to identify new p300/CBP HAT inhibitors. In Aim 2, we will validate novel p300/CBP candidates using
three complementary assays to identify inhibitors an IC50 of at least 10 µM. These assays will not only confirm
inhibitor specificity but will also validate biochemical activity in cells. In Aim 3, we will perform iterative medicinal
chemistry with the goal of identifying lead candidates. In parallel to these studies, we will perform both chemical
and genetic experiments to systematically identify tumor subtypes that depend on p300/CBP HAT activity for cell
fitness (Aim 4).
 To perform these studies, we have assembled a multidisciplinary research team with the necessary
experience and expertise in cancer biology, structural biology, medicinal chemistry and drug development. We
anticipate that these studies will allow us to identify small molecules that will serve as lead candidates that will
spur the development of clinical grade p300/CBP HAT inhibitors and define which patient populations are likely
to benefit from such inhibitors."
10841329,"PROJECT SUMMARY
American Indian (AI) youth demonstrate early substance use initiation and subsequently high substance
misuse rates. One factor contributing to this is the relative lack of prevention strategies that leverage contextual
and cultural strengths to optimize effectiveness and sustainability. Rich cultural and traditional practices make
interpersonal relationships particularly vital for AI youth, but these networks are largely untapped in prevention
approaches. Research in other populations demonstrates social networks' roles in risk and resilience.
However, data on AI social networks are sparse, and data on how networks relate to risk for early substance
use is virtually nonexistent. Preliminary data from the Tribal Reservation Adolescent Connections Study
(R21DA053789) confirmed suspicions that social network theories require some adaptation to the culture and
context of AI communities. The proposed study will collect quantitative social network surveys among
adolescents and community organizations and qualitative interviews with adolescents on a Northern Plains
reservation to explore how these networks are structured, the principles under which they operate, and their
influence on behavior over critical periods of adolescence. Network characteristics will be examined in relation
to substance use, suicide, and exposure to violence, to understand how and when networks impact risk and
resilience. A cohort sequential longitudinal and explanatory sequential mixed method design (QUAN → Qual)
will be used to accomplish three specific aims: Aim 1: Identify changes in AI adolescents’ peer and kinship
social networks over time. Hypothesis: Social network composition and structure will change from late
childhood into late adolescence and those changes will include shifts in network size, proportion of family in
networks, and gender homophily. Aim 2: Analyze community-based interorganizational networks among
youth-serving institutions. Hypothesis: These networks will vary over time and location, resulting in varied
coordination of youth services across communities. Aim 3: Test the relationship of peer, kinship, and
community-based network characteristics to trajectories of substance use over time and in
combination with violence and suicide. Hypothesis: Trajectories of substance use, violence, and suicide will
be related and influenced by both stable and dynamic youth and community networks. This project will be led
by a team of early-stage Principal Investigators who are American Indian and Alaska Native. They have
expertise in substance use, exposure to violence and suicide among AIs, expertise in community-engaged
research with tribal communities, social network analyses, and quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods
approaches. This leadership team will be supported by two senior researchers with experience in areas
relevant to this study and 20 years of experience conducting research with the reservation where the study will
take place and an expert in longitudinal social network analysis at the individual and community level."

How molecular organization and activity leads to tissue level outcomes is an open
question in biology and biomedical research. Addressing this question is technically
challenging because we cannot observe with molecular precision at the tissue scale.
While optical microscopy is the method of choice to observe architecture and dynamics
within living cells and organisms, it has severe limitations in spatiotemporal resolution and
volumetric coverage. Thus, our most detailed observations of cellular dynamics and
ultrastructure have been limited to single cells on coverslips, which were far removed from
their physiological context.
Here I propose to extend the capabilities of light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM),
a technology that provides gentle and efficient 3D imaging, but only moderate resolution.
We will combine LSFM with super-resolution methods to allow rapid imaging of
subcellular dynamics away from coverslips. We will further explore ways to increase the
volumetric acquisition rate of LSFM such that large samples can be rapidly explored.
These new developments will be tied together by smart sampling strategies, which will
enable autonomous exploration of large samples while applying the highest resolution
only locally. This way, we expect that rare cellular events can be studied in subcellular
detail in entire model organisms or organs that were rendered transparent through
clearing. The proposed rapid volumetric imaging capabilities will enable imaging of all
neurons in a small model organism such as C.elegans or Zebrafish embryos with up to
100 Hz volume rate. Such rapid pan-neuronal imaging may shed light on how a brain
functions. While we expect that the potential for discovery with such microscope
technology is immense, access to such advanced instrumentation is often limited. To
address this, we will develop a modular light-sheet platform that can be adapted to a wide
range of imaging tasks. We will further explore ways to simplify the microscope
architecture and design less expensive variants to aid dissemination.
The resulting new microscope technology will enable large volume imaging experiments
that have been prohibited by either lack of spatial resolution or acquisition speed, and as
such accelerate biological and biomedical research."
10841102,"7. Project Summary
Effective antiviral therapeutics are needed for the treatment of KSHV infection. We propose to pinpoint novel
KSHV antiviral targets by identifying virus specific protein functions and conformations. This project aims to study
the molecular interactions (protein-DNA and protein-protein) that govern KSHV DNA synthesis and genome
replication using a highly specialized electron microscopy (EM) approach. Previous studies used sequence
homology between KSHV and related herpesviruses to determine conserved protein functions of the seven
essential core DNA replication genes/proteins encoded by KSHV: ORF6(SSB), ORF9(POL), ORF40/41(PAF),
ORF44(HEL), ORF56(PRI), ORF59(PF) and ORF50(RTA). However, protein sequence homologies only range
from 20-50% and thus poorly predict protein function; therefore, an ultrastructural characterization of purified
KSHV viral DNA replication proteins, individually and in concert are needed to identify their full range of functions
(Aim 1). To evaluate the in vitro activities, electron microscopy (EM) will be used to directly visualize viral proteins
and viral DNAs. Our EM approach produces qualitative data (heterogeneous protein complexes, oligomeric
state, DNA architecture) and quantitative data (DNA mapping of protein binding locations, molecular size
comparisons). The first aim of this proposal will characterize the molecular interactions and activities of a subset
of already purified KSHV DNA replication proteins. The findings will provide valuable insights into KSHV
replication and inform future studies of proteins purified from a human cell culture system to directly compare
the impact of viral protein post-translational modifications of proteins produced from insect cells with human cell
native modifications. The second aim of this proposal is focused on generating viral proteins in physiologically
relevant human cell lines. We have previously produced five of the seven KSHV replication proteins using an
insect Sf9 cell system, but commercial and lab attempts to express and purify the remaining two proteins (PAF
and PRI) from non-mammalian cells have been unsuccessful. We hypothesize that by utilizing relevant human
cell types, we will overcome the challenges of producing viral proteins in non-human cell lines and enhance the
functionality of the purified proteins (Aim 2). This in-depth molecular study of the core DNA replication proteins
will advance the general understanding of KSHV biology and gamma-herpesvirus replication and the data
generated from this proposal will provide the foundation for future proposals aimed at identifying virus specific
inhibitors to prevent KSHV infection. Finally, trainees (undergraduate and graduate students) will gain exposure
and expertise in a wide range of biochemical and molecular biology approaches while also learning unique,
highly-specialized EM techniques while completing Aims 1 and 2."

Parent grant “Reducing Avoidable Nursing Home-to-Hospital Transfers of Residents with ADRD: An Analysis
of Interdisciplinary Team Communication using Text Messages” (1R01AG078281-01)
Close to two-thirds of the over 1.3 million U.S nursing home (NH) residents have a cognitive impairment such
as Alzheimer’s disease or a related dementia, and are at high risk of hospital transfer. Reducing avoidable
hospitalizations for NH residents is a national priority due to the negative effects on resident health and high
Medicare and Medicaid costs. NH-to-hospital transfers result in > $2.6 billion in expenditures annually, harm to
residents from physical and emotional relocation stress, and is avoidable in as many as 60% of cases.
Avoidable NH-to-hospital transfers include transfers for conditions that can be safely and effectively managed
in the NH. Early illness recognition and treatment could prevent the need for hospital transfer altogether,
ultimately reducing morbidity and mortality in residents with ADRD while controlling costs. NH-to-hospital
transfer decision-making is complex and relies on timely transmission of information among the
interdisciplinary team. Unfortunately, many NHs rely on antiquated communication methods (e.g. phone, fax)
rather than leveraging modern, convenient, and low-cost options, like text messaging (TM), which could
improve health information sharing. Complicating the decision-making process about residents with ADRD is
the progressive loss of language impacting the individual’s ability to communicate. We hypothesize that
communication among health care team members differs for NH residents with and without ADRD. Our dataset
provides an ideal and novel opportunity to apply natural language processing and social network analysis to
TMs shared among an interdisciplinary team about NH resident transfer. We propose to examine the content
of TM using the age-friendly health system 4M framework, which includes four evidence-based elements of
high-quality care (what Matters, Medications, Mentation, and Mobility). The 4M framework addresses the core
issues that should drive all decision making in the care of older adults and is a way of systematically rethinking
care in ways that improve patient health and satisfaction. A critical need exists to examine how convenient,
low-cost communication options like TM can reduce avoidable NH-to-hospital transfers of residents with
ADRD. Our aims are to: 1) Identify documentation of the 4Ms in health information shared by the
interdisciplinary team through electronic TM two weeks prior to NH-to-hospital transfer of residents with ADRD
2) Estimate the effects of the 4Ms found in TMs on avoidable NH-to-hospital transfers and 3) Compare
communication patterns of interdisciplinary teams making transfer decisions about residents with and without
ADRD. A potential impact of this work is to decrease avoidable hospitalizations, and ultimately, morbidity and
mortality in NH residents with ADRD by identifying evidence-based elements of high-quality care for older
adults (4Ms). Another potential impact is the development of a structured language allowing for timely and
seamless portability of information across the complete spectrum of care, optimizing the health of individuals
and populations."
10841874,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The objectives of this research program are to understand the structural, functional, and molecular
mechanisms of two classes of integral membrane proteins in eukaryotes: ion channels and enzymes that
catalyze chemical reactions within lipid membranes. For ion channels, we aim to discover the mechanisms by
which the channels conduct ions across cellular membranes, achieve ion selectivity, and are gated. Regarding
membrane enzymes, the salient questions we will address include how both water-soluble and lipophilic
substrates access membrane-embedded active sites, what underlies chemical mechanisms of catalysis, what
conformational changes occur during the reaction cycles, and what constraints the lipid membrane places on
these processes. We combine approaches to determine three-dimensional structures (X-ray crystallography
and cryo-electron microscopy) with functional analyses (e.g. electrophysiology, enzymology, and biochemistry)
to pursue holistic mechanistic understandings of these complex molecular machines.
The ion channels under study include the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, the bestrophin (BEST) family of
calcium-activated chloride channels, and two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channels. The mitochondrial
calcium uniporter is a highly regulated multi-subunit ion channel complex. It is the primary conduit for
mitochondrial calcium entry and thereby regulates ATP synthesis and other processes. Our efforts are aimed
to discover the channel’s modes of ion selectivity and gating, and to investigate functions of its regulatory
subunits. BEST channels form anion-selective pores that are regulated by intracellular calcium,
phosphorylation, and changes in cell volume. Mutations in BEST channels cause retinal degenerative
diseases. Our efforts are geared to understand the gating and selectivity properties of the channels, with
particular attention to: differences among human BEST1-4 channels, interactions with binding partners (e.g.
lipids and other proteins), and the possibility that the channels conduct neurotransmitters. K2P channels
establish the resting potential of cells and thereby regulate immune responses and neuronal firing. We aim to
determine the structures and mechanisms of the channels, with emphasis on regulation by cellular binding
partners.
Regarding our studies of integral membrane enzymes, current focuses are the enzymes ICMT and RCE1,
which catalyze posttranslational modifications of RAS and other CAAX proteins, and the enzymes HHAT and
GOAT, which attach acyl groups onto the signaling molecules Hedgehog and ghrelin. We aim to determine
atomic structures of these enzymes with substrates, substrate analogs, and products that represent snapshots
of their reaction coordinates – and to combine these efforts with experiments that address function.
The studies will reveal principles of ion channel and enzyme function, thereby making substantial contributions
to the understandings of the physiological processes that these membrane proteins control."
10842002,"Abstract
Population sequencing and clinical genetic testing are producing vast and growing catalogs of human genetic
variation. Some key emerging bottlenecks are to understand: (a) which variants alter gene function, (b) the
mechanism(s) by which they act, and (c) to what extent these functional changes influence traits and disease
risk. We address these questions by developing and applying massively parallel approaches to test many
thousands of gene variants under experimental functional selections. We have shown, in a diverse range of
genes, that the resulting maps are highly concordant with existing knowledge, and that they can guide the
interpretation of variants discovered during clinical genetic testing to increase its accuracy and actionability.
Here, we seek to capitalize on these methods’ scalability to apply them across an entire pathway of functionally
related genes involved in DNA mismatch repair (MMR), which is implicated in inherited cancer risk syndromes
affecting ≥1:300 individuals worldwide. We will carefully interrogate variants that display intermediate levels of
function, which are commonly overlooked in such large-scale screens. We hypothesize that rather than being
entirely ‘noise’, many of these are hypomorphic alleles, and that they may affect disease risk more subtly (e.g.,
with reduced penetrance) or only conditionally (e.g., when combined in cis with a regulatory variant). In addition,
we are intrigued by anecdotal examples of epistatic interactions within and between MMR genes – that is, pairs
of variants that together yield effects that differ from sum of their individual effects. We propose that the MMR
pathway genes will serve as a useful case study to assess how prevalent these types of variants and interactions
are, and to what extent they contribute to pathogenic burden. Finally, we propose to establish functional readouts
to newly enable pooled screens and/or selections for entire classes of clinically actionable human genes,
broadening our focus to DNA damage response genes beyond MMR, which are implicated in diverse disorders
including cancers as well as immunodeficiencies and neurodevelopmental disorders. To establish these maps’
real-world utility, we will validate and calibrate them by comparison to biobanks with linked genotype and health
record data. Importantly, by testing every possible variant, these approaches avoid population biases common
among current large genomic datasets. In sum, these studies will make hundreds of genes newly amenable to
large-scale structure-function mapping, and will improve the accurate and equitable interpretation of clinical
variants."
10850666,"We propose a new research paradigm aimed at addressing scientific questions in both biosensing and
machine learning for the early prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and at solving a grand challenge in
the identification of minimally-invasive AD biomarkers in tear, saliva, and blood. Our goal is to develop a
novel and minimally-invasive system that integrates a multimodal biosensing platform and a machine
learning framework, which synergistically work together to significantly enhance the detection accuracy.
The program will pioneer a novel Multimodal Optical, Mechanical, Electrochemical Nano-sensor with Twodimensional
material Amplification (MOMENTA) platform for sensitive and selective detection of AD
biomarkers. The sensor outputs are used for training the new Hierarchical Multimodal Machine Learning
(HMML) framework, which not only automatically integrates the heterogeneous data from different
modalities but also ranks the importance of different biosensors and biomarkers for AD prediction.
Moreover, the framework is able to identify potential new biomarkers based on a statistical analysis of the
learned weights on the input signals and provide feedback information to further improve the MOMENTA
platform design. This interdisciplinary research brings together materials scientists who create new twodimensional
(2D) material platforms for sensor enhancement, nanotechnology and device experts who
advance chip-scale sensor platforms, data scientists who analyze data with machine learning methods to
target early prediction of AD, and AD experts who help to identify potentially new AD biomarkers. The
machine-learning-enhanced multi-modal sensor system will not only offer major performance boost
compared to state-of-the-art, but also yield critical insights on new biomarker discovery for AD diagnosis at
an early stage."
10828918,"ABSTRACT: Physical disability is common in U.S. older adults, with a higher prevalence in Black vs. White
Americans. Physical functioning declines with aging due to biomechanical and biochemical effects. Skeletal
muscle and the liver are highly active metabolic organs contributing to biochemical effects involved in multiple
physiologic processes. However, with aging, excess fat accumulates ectopically in and around muscle and the
liver, impairing normal functioning and causing negative metabolic consequences. In fact, skeletal muscle and
the liver share common pathophysiological mechanisms, e.g., insulin resistance and chronic inflammation, that
predict physical disability. Individuals of African ancestry have more muscle adiposity, but paradoxically, less
liver adiposity than White Americans. A better understanding of the underlying biology of muscle and liver adi-
posity in Black vs. White older adults could potentially explain health disparities. Lipidomics is a promising
method to better understand metabolic mechanisms underlying muscle and liver adiposity since it directly
measures lipids left behind from cellular processes that have shown to have extensive biological relevance.
The Principal Investigator, Dr. Marron, previously found several triglycerides were higher and several were
lower in older adults with high vs. low walking ability, where the direction in associations directly depended on
degree of fatty acid saturation. These findings led to this project, to investigate lipid pathways associated with
muscle and liver adiposity, since ectopic fat depots are likely major drivers of functional capacity with aging and
both muscle and liver share common pathophysiologic processes that predict disability. Thus, Dr. Marron pro-
poses to apply lipidomics to measure >1000 plasma lipids and use existing computed tomography of skeletal
muscle and the liver in a subset ages 50+ from the Tobago Study, a Black Caribbean cohort and the Coronary
Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a Black and White American cohort. This proposal
will: 1) characterize, for the first time, differences in muscle and liver composition in Black Caribbeans, Black
Americans, and White Americans; 2) compare associations between lipids and muscle and liver adiposity in
Black Caribbeans, Black Americans, and White Americans and assess if differences are driven by ancestry
admixture or environment/behavior; and 3) develop and validate a metabolite composite score indicative of
muscle and liver health. The career development award will provide protected time for Dr. Marron to cultivate
her emerging research program and initiate a path towards independence. The proposal has been designed to
1) gain didactic training in biochemistry, lipid metabolism, and body composition by race/ethnicity; 2) leverage
cutting-edge techniques, i.e., untargeted lipidomics with a novel isotope dilution approach and computed to-
mography, to expand existing knowledge of underlying pathogenic mechanisms of muscle and liver adiposity;
and 3) enhance mentorship and grantsmanship to obtain funding to reach a long-term goal of elucidating novel
intervention targets to preserve muscle and liver health and physical functioning with aging."
10830393,"Program Summary/Abstract
The present proposal is a continuation of an interdisciplinary, predoctoral training program in research on
substance use disorders (SUDs) currently in its 29th year as a NIDA-supported training grant. The objective
continues to be the preparation of individuals for careers that require broad knowledge and research expertise
in addiction science, with emphasis on the abuse of drugs and alcohol (alone or in combination), consistent
with the Collaborative Research on Addiction at NIH (CRAN). Only predoctoral trainees with an established
interest in pursuing research related to SUDs are selected from a substantial pool of competitive applicants at
the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (UNC-CH). The environment at UNC-CH provides optimal
resources for training in addiction science, including rapidly advancing 21st century methodologies. First, the
training program includes a core of faculty mentors whose research and teaching activities provide a broad
spectrum of research training opportunities. These include research programs focusing on motivated
behaviors, opioid and cytokine neurobiology, astrocytes in SUDs, the neuropharmacology and neurobiological
effects of abused substances, investigations of the immune system and of HIV/AIDS and drug abuse,
behavioral genetics of drug abuse and vulnerability and impulsivity. The inclusion of mentors from the Clinical
Psychology program and from UNC’s Obstetrics & Gynecology Department brings research opportunities in
translational areas that will enrich the trainees’ knowledge in substance abuse treatment. Research
laboratories are located within the Psychology and Neuroscience Department, the Psychiatry Department, the
Neuroscience Center and the Center for Alcohol Studies. Second, all trainees receive formal training in basic
neural and behavioral sciences and statistics. More focused training related to addiction science takes place
through several interdepartmental courses and seminars and extensive laboratory research. Third, the
program offers many opportunities for professional development through a yearlong Seminar in Addiction
Science which trainees take part in every year as they progress through the program. The Seminar in
Addiction Science provides a) training in grant writing, b) practice in making research presentations, c)
numerous presentations by outside scientists in addiction science and d) introduction of a range of career
options. Fourth, the trainees regularly present their research at national meetings and receive training in
teaching skills. Finally, UNC-CH is committed to maintaining ethical conduct in research and instruction on this
topic is integrated from a variety of sources and takes place over the course of the entire training period. Over
the last 15 years, 43 trainees have received their PhD (average time to degree: 5.5 yrs.) and the program has
successfully trained several individuals from underrepresented groups. Upon completion of the program,
trainees have established careers within addiction science, in both academic and research-intensive settings."

Alcohol use disorders (AUD) are complex behaviors accompanied by substantial morbidity, mortality and societal
expense. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to AUD. Despite progress in the human genetics of
AUD, especially the identification of genome-wide significant AUD genetic risk variants, the neural basis of AUD
in humans is largely unknown. Over the past five years, we have provided compelling evidence that: 1) Human
neuronal cells derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be used as a tractable model to study
neuropsychiatric disorders including AUD; 2) Ethanol exposure results in an inflammasome response in human
neurons; 3) Human neurons carrying OPRM1 A118G minor gene variants showed enhanced sensitivity to
opioids and ethanol; 4) Ethanol causes gene expression changes in both human neurons and glial cells; and 5)
Microglia-containing 3D neural cultures can be a powerful system to study neuroinflammatory microglia-neuronal
interactions. These premises provide a foundation for further mechanistic studies of the genetic and molecular
underpinnings of AUD in human iPS cell-derived neural models. We also identified key gaps of knowledge in
utilizing human neurons as a model system to study AUD that need to be filled, particularly: 1) how ethanol
affects neuro-glial interactions in a human neural context is not known; and 2) how ethanol affects neurogenesis
in a 3D context is not known. Moreover, 3) because of the polygenic nature of AUD, the contribution of single
gene to AUD risk is likely small and the phenotypical manifestation is strongly influenced by individual’s genetic
makeup. To address these outstanding questions, we hypothesize that ethanol impairs neuronal function via
affecting neuroglial interactions, which is influenced by individual polygenic risk backgrounds. We have selected
36 subjects of both sexes with either extremely high polygenic risk score (PRS, top 10%ile, n=18 AUD) or low
PRS (bottom 10%ile, n=18, no AUD) to test this hypothesis. We will differentiate iPS cells derived from these
subjects into both 2D and 3D (i.e. brain organoids) neuronal cells co-cultured with human astrocytes and human
microglia. Upon exposure to ethanol, these neural cells are subjected to a combination of morphological,
immunocytochemical, electrophysiological, live cell imaging and genomic analyses to unravel the mechanism(s)
underlying the impact of ethanol, focusing on neuro-astro-microglial interactions. In a relatively large collection
of human iPS cells (n=36 lines) derived from subjects with extreme AUD PRSs, we hope to unravel the
convergent phenotype and gene-networks that are linked to extreme high or low AUD PRSs. The results will
advance our mechanistic understanding of the pathogenic role of AUD risk gene variants and the influence of
polygenic risk background in a human neural system."

This project is designed to identify a noninvasive and highly effective gene delivery strategy to target
specific neural cells in the CNS and to validate this technology by delivering regenerative molecules to
mammals with CNS injury. We will determine whether systemic delivery of our newly engineered AAV9
vectors can transduce most target CNS cells and whether noninvasive delivery of the genes that target
neuronal intrinsic and extrinsic factors can promote robust axon regeneration and functional recovery
in rodents with spinal cord injury (SCI). A major challenge in neuroscience research is to deliver target
genes to specific types of neural cells widely distributed in CNS. Engineered AAV9 vectors usually
show limited efficacy after intravenous (IV) injection by transducing cells only in some CNS regions.
We thus created new AAV9 vectors that include multiple features of engineered AAV9 capsids, aiming
to develop highly efficient BBB-crossing AAV9 vectors (HEBC-AAV9) that can transduce most target
CNS cells after IV injection. In Aim 1, we will study efficiency of our novel HEBC-AAV9-GFP vectors
for selectively transducing each type of neural cells (neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and
microglia) in several strains of adult mice. To solve a crucial issue in neuroscience research with this
technology, in Aim 2 we will develop a regenerative therapy for SCI by systemic delivery of genes to
target neuronal let-7 miRNA. After SCI, severed axons fail to regenerate partly because of reduced
intrinsic growth capacity of mature neurons. Many genes are known to control the growth ability of
mature neurons, but none have been translated to clinical use. The best targets are probably those
with potential to impact multiple genes. Among them, let-7 is important for regulating age-dependent
decline in axon regeneration in worms. In Aim 2, we propose to use unique HEBC-AAV9-synapsin
vectors to target neurons selectively for inducing expression of let-7 inhibitor, lin28, and lin41, aiming
to promote robust regeneration of multiple axon tracts by enhancing growth capacity of mature neurons
in SCI rodents. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) generated by glial scars strongly suppress
axon extension and are major extrinsic molecular targets for treating CNS injury. Our lab designed
small peptides to block functions of CSPG receptor LAR, PTPσ, and PTPδ by targeting their critical
activity domains and demonstrated their high efficiency for promoting axon regrowth. In Aim 3, we will
induce astrocytic expression of secreted 3 peptides for each of LAR, PTPσ, and PTPδ with HEBC-
AAV9-GFAP vectors, aiming to promote robust axon regeneration after SCI by targeting extrinsic
CSPGs alone or combined with intrinsic let-7 signals. Our new viral vectors should provide a powerful
tool for gene delivery in CNS and for developing effective regenerative therapies for SCI and other
neurological disorders."

The over-arching goals of Dr, Rameau's Beeson application are (1) to develop an easy-to-use, highly
accurate bedside clinical decision support tool to identify swallowing dysfunction in older adults using analysis
of features of their recorded voice, cough and speech, and (2) to become a leader in the nascent field of
geriatric otolaryngology with a focus on management of speech and swallowing issues in older adults with
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD).
Candidate: The applicant, Dr. Anaïs Rameau, is an otolaryngologist at Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC)
who has demonstrated significant research ability and clinical interest in geriatric otolaryngology, especially in
the care of older adults with dysphagia. Dr. Rameau's long-term career goal is to become an independent
researcher and academic leader in geriatric dysphagia. She already laid significant foundations towards this
goal, developing close mentorship relationships, gaining broad research, clinical, management and leadership
skills, and experience as PI on multiple institutional and foundation grants.
Mentors: To achieve her objectives, Dr. Rameau has engaged an exceptional, transdisciplinary team of
mentors, who are highly successful, NIH-funded investigators and well-recognized leaders and experts in their
respective fields. Her mentorship team includes Dr. Mark Lachs, Co-Director of the WCMC Division of
Geriatrics, Dr. Michael Stewart, Chair of the WCM Department of Otolaryngology – Head & Neck Surgery, and
Dr. Sara Czaja, Director of the Center on Aging and Behavioral Research at WCM.
Research: In collaboration with bio-acousticians at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, our research, both in an
excised canine model and a human pilot study, has suggested that conventional acoustic metrics of voice and
cough sound differ in important ways between patients with and without aspiration risk. These characteristics
may serve as biomarkers of dysphagia, and acoustic analysis of the patient's digitally recorded voice and
cough has the potential to effectively differentiate between normal and abnormal swallowing. Including multiple
characteristics, such as those specifically evaluating oral frailty, and combining the results may increase
accuracy of swallowing dysfunction identification, especially in older adults with AD/ADRD who are more prone
to silent aspiration. Adding non-linear methods and machine learning to conventional acoustic analysis may
also improve accuracy. Dr. Rameau proposes to use these techniques to develop a clinical decision support
tool that incorporates analysis of multiple characteristics of a patient's recorded voice and cough to determine
their aspiration risk. To increase the potential for use of this tool at the bedside, she will modify it for recordings
on a smartphone as part of a mobile application. Upon completion of this research, she plans to submit an R01
to prospectively examine the performance of the clinical decision support tool in a multi-site RCT in large,
diverse cohort of older adults."

 People living with HIV (PLWH) are at a significantly high risk of developing Pulmonary Hypertension (PH),
which can lead to death by heart failure, even with the suppressive effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART). PH is
characterized by phenotypic changes in endothelial cells that result in increased pulmonary artery pressures and
right ventricular hypertrophy. However, the underlying mechanism of how HIV contributes to the development of
HIV-PH is still not fully understood. Our team has previously identified an association between specific HIV
polymorphisms and the susceptibility to HIV-PH in patients. This proposal focuses on increasing the knowledge
of how the pulmonary vasculature responds to HIV and determining how specific HIV polymorphisms contribute
to the pathogenesis of HIV-associated vascular disease. To address this gap in knowledge, and guided by the
literature and our preliminary studies, we propose conducting experiments in human vascular cells in vitro and
in hu-mice to investigate the role of the CXCR4 signaling pathway elicited by HIV-PH polymorphisms in ECs, the
impact of HIV-PH variants and ART in SMC constriction in vitro and in pulmonary vascular hemodynamics in hu-
mice and transcriptomics (using scRNA-seq) and epigenomics (using scATAC-seq) changes induced by HIV-
PH in pulmonary vascular cell sub-populations in hu-mice. This proposal addresses high-priority research areas
established by the Office of AIDS Research and the NHLBI by addressing PH as an HIV-associated comorbidity
that is not improved by ART. Our findings will inform future therapeutic advances tailored to HIV-PH. The
strengths of this proposal build upon its multifaceted approach, compelling data on the role of HIV proteins in
PH, access to HIV-PH biospecimens, utilization of a novel mouse model of HIV-PH, and a strong team of
investigators with significant and complementary expertise."

To what extent is adaptive evolution predictable? Despite its importance in understanding the biology of human diseases,
including the evolution of viral and bacterial pathogens, the dynamics of genetic adaptation are still poorly understood. In
particular, few examples yet exist that have been dissected to the molecular level. Examples of adaptations from natural
systems and the use of model organisms are powerful tools that can be combined to make progress on this difficult
question. We have employed instances of “parallel evolution”, involving assemblages of species experiencing a common
regime of natural selection, to evaluate multiple outcomes of the process of adaptation. With this information, we can
learn about recurrent features of adaptation and infer constraints and regularities in the adaptive process. Our work
focused on the biomedically-important interaction between Na+,K+-ATPases and their regulatory steroidal-glycosides that
a large variety of plants and animals use as toxins to defend themselves from being eaten. Using a diverse set of animals
that have independently evolved resistance to steroidal-glycoside toxicity, including insects and vertebrates, we
discovered these diverse species most often evolve resistance via a small number of possible options (i.e. involving only
three of 41 possible sites in the protein that could be modified to confer resistance). These findings suggest that adaptive
evolution is often path-dependent, implying that the individual components of an adaptation must evolve in a prescribed,
and ultimately predictable, order. They also raise numerous questions about the nature of this path dependency, including
the extent to which it emerges from interactions among residues within a protein, or from the genomic background of the
species; whether it similarly constrains adaptation over short and longer time scales, and how generally it applies in
adaptive protein evolution. Here we propose three aims that address these questions, by combining approaches from
evolutionary genomics and molecular genetics. In Aim 1, we will use genome engineering in Drosophila to elucidate the
path dependence of the steroidal-glycoside resistance adaptation both at the level of its primary target (Na+,K+-ATPase)
and at the level of the whole genome. In Aim 2, we will determine which and how many genomic factors contribute to
naturally occurring variation within Drosophila populations. This information will reveal the relationship between within-
population and between-species genetic variation underlying the same trait, connecting short- and long-term dynamics of
the adaptive process. In Aim 3, we will use principles learned from molecular adaptation at Na+,K+-ATPase to
computationally predict and use genome engineering to functionally validate path dependent adaptation dynamics in
Drosophila for a diverse group of proteins, many of which (like Na+,K+-ATPase) have important roles in neurological
development and homeostasis. Together this work will greatly increase our understanding of the constraints on adaptive
protein evolution and the predictability of the genetic changes by which novel phenotypes emerge."

Over the past nine years, the Hillman Cancer Center (HCC) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
(UPMC) has trained and mentored 134 high school students from underrepresented minority (URM) groups
and economically disadvantaged (DA) backgrounds hailing from over 60 high schools. Our newly proposed
Hillman Academy will expand the successes of our current program, which is funded under the expiring
Continuing Umbrella of Research Experiences to the HCC and was recognized in 2014 with the Carnegie
Science Center Leadership in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) Education Award.
Our past participants performed research over a wide range of cancer topics at six research sites across the
campus under the tutelage of 106 faculty members who supported our students as hosts and mentors. Our
alumni have won numerous scholarships and awards, coauthored manuscripts, presented at national scientific
conferences, and continued research both with us and at the top institutions that they now attend. Ninety-three
percent of our alumni with known and declared undergraduate majors matriculated into science- and
healthcare-related areas of study. We aim to continue these successes with an expanded program to reach
even more URM/DA students—24 per year—to increase the diversity and preparedness of the cancer
workforce through a multi-modal approach that includes immersive research experiences, didactic training with
tailored curricula, and professional and academic development. We will also lead a number of outreach
activities in our region to raise awareness of cancer, cancer disparities, and cancer research through our
collaborations with long-standing community partners, such as the Fund for the Advancement of Minorities
through Education, MPowerhouse, Inc., and the Homeless Children’s Education Fund. These efforts will grow
out of the Hillman Academy to engage URM/DA students at earlier stages, as well as, their schools and other
community members. Together, the Hillman Academy will engage, train, and provide paths for URM/DA youth
to advance cancer research and care. Our leadership, infrastructure, mentors, and experience of running a
holistic research training program position us for lasting success in this endeavor. We will build on our previous
accomplishments of promoting the pursuit of STEM education and careers for our students and continue to
address cancer disparities by equipping URM/DA youth to be agents of change that impact their communities."
10835913,"Humoral immunity is an essential component of the immune response to flavivirus infection. Primary infection generates a robust neutralizing antibody response that mediates viral control and protection. It is becoming increasingly apparent that secondary infection with a closely related flavivirus strain can result in immunological cross-reactivity; however, the consequences to infection outcome are hotly debated and controversial. Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, which has a high degree of sequence and structural homology to Dengue virus (DENV), and is responsible for continuing epidemics of fetal congenital malformations within the Americas since its introduction to Brazil in 2015. Prior flavivirus exposure has been strongly associated with generation of cross-reactive antibodies that bind to and/or neutralize ZIKV. A unique aspect of ZIKV pathogenesis is the ability of the virus to seed infection within the placenta, however, the mechanisms of transplacental ZIKV infection are not well understood. The overall goal of this proposal is to understand how cross-reactive antibodies facilitate ZIKV transcytosis and seed infection of the placenta. The placenta is composed of anchoring chorionic villi, which penetrate the uterine wall, as well as floating chorionic villi that are bathed in maternal blood pooling in the intervillous space. Recent epidemiological observations found that between 20-50% of pregnant women with possible ZIKV exposure had detectable ZIKV RNA in the placenta. Another report found that ZIKV can persist in the placenta for over 200 days post mother onset of Zika symptoms. We discovered that Hofbauer cells, fetally- derived placental macrophages located within the villus stroma, are permissive for ZIKV infection. To identify a potential mechanism by which ZIKV gains access to the villous stroma, we recently evaluated the impact of cross-reactive dengue antibodies in mediating transplacental infection. Using an ex vivo placental explant model, we observed profound enhancement of ZIKV infection of human mid-gestation floating chorionic villi with ZIKV immune complexes generated using either DENV or ZIKV cross-reactive convalescent serum or monoclonal antibodies. Similar to histological analysis of placenta from infected pregnant mothers, ZIKV replicated exclusively within Hofbauer cells. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that the Fab fragment (specificity for ZIKV) and the Fc domain (affinity for FcRn and FcγR) of IgG impacts antibody-mediated ZIKV transplacental infection. Moreover, we believe that gestational age of the placenta dynamically influences the efficiency of ZIKV transcytosis and placental infection. Moreover, we believe that gestational age of the placenta dynamically impacts ZIKV transcytosis and placental infection. In this proposal, we seek to address the following outstanding questions: 1) How does IgG antibody specificity, affinity and Fc/FcRn interactions impact ZIKV transplacental infection? and 2) How does placental gestational age impacts antibody-mediated infection of Hofbauer cells? Our studies will likely reveal therapeutic targets and provide insights for development a vaccine to protect against ZIKV infection."

How do cortical populations represent sensory input and support perceptual decision making? It has long been
known that the responses of individual neurons to the repeated presentation of a stimulus are highly variable.
Nonetheless, the pattern of activity across a population encodes enough information to support precise
perceptual decisions. This implies that hidden in the distribution of population responses there are invariant
features, yet to be identified, which robustly encode the sensory stimulus from one trial to the next. Here we
propose to mathematically model the conditional distribution of the population response given a stimulus and to
uncover the invariant features that support the reliable discrimination of sensory stimuli.
Surprisingly, preliminary data reveal that the distribution of population responses to a fixed stimulus is star-
shaped — in any one trial, the population vector can point in one among a finite set of directions. The directions
are highly invariant across trials, while the amplitude of the responses is variable. Based on these observations
we hypothesize that cortical coding is a one-to-many correspondence. This idea represents a major departure
from the prevailing view of cortical coding as a one-to-one map between a stimulus and a population direction.
We propose to study star-shaped distributions and their role in the encoding of sensory information with the
following three Aims: (a) measure population responses to the repeated presentation of a stimulus and test the
hypothesis the structure is well-described by star-shaped distributions, (b) test a mathematical model linking the
direction of population responses evoked in indiviudal trials to behavioral choice in a discrimination task, (c)
establish if star-shaped distributions are generated in the cortex or inherited from thalamic input.
The proposed studies are significant because they challenge the dominant view that cortical coding implements
a one-to-one map. We introduce an innovative framework to study and understand the structure of cortical
variability that generalizes prior approaches, yielding predictive models that link population activity to behavior.
Altogether, the proposed studies will significantly advance our understanding of cortical coding and function."

Project 1 The epidemiology of complex malaria in Southeast Asia
Malaria is a significant health concern in Southeast Asia. The main parasites in this region are Plasmodium vivax
and Plasmodium falciparum. At present, Southeast Asian countries are working to eliminate malaria; however,
its epidemiology is rapidly changing, creating new obstacles. The current challenges include a shift from P.
falciparum to P. vivax in many countries, the large social and ecological diversity of the remaining endemic areas,
the change in land use that alters the disease transmission ecology, and a rapid increase in zoonotic cases due
to P. knowlesi. To address these challenges, our study has four main objectives:
1. To understand the epidemiology of malaria in Southeast Asia by monitoring and understanding transmission
 dynamics, risk factors, and parasite genetics;
2. To identify seromarkers for P. knowlesi infection, enabling cost-effective serosurveys to track P. knowlesi
transmission;
3. To identify new parasite antigens to improve point-of-care diagnosis, including rapid diagnostic tests for pan-
 malaria detection and P. knowlesi-specific detection;
4. To understand the parasitological factors that underly severe P. knowlesi malaria by examining parasite
 genes associated with virulence and in vitro phenotypes;
The study will improve our understanding of the disease and the complexity of its transmission in Southeast
Asia, provide better tools for point-of-care diagnosis and community surveillance, and elicit information-rich
datasets to inform malaria-elimination strategies in Southeast Asia."

independent research scientists making significant contributions to our understanding of this public health
disease, as well as to developing and rigorously testing evidence-based prevention strategies. The training
program will recruit MD and/or PhD scholars that will progress towards research independence through three
inter-related training activities: (1) didactic training acquired through formal coursework, research seminars,
workshops, and distinguished faculty lectures; (2) experiential training acquired through an applied research
experience conducted under the guidance of highly qualified mentoring faculty; and, (3) the preparation of a
formal research project and/or grant proposal. Fellows will also receive training in the responsible conduct of
research and methods to ensure scientific rigor and reproducibility in their work. Given the early state of the
field, we will utilize a collaborative, cross-disciplinary, and multi-method approach that emphasizes: (1) the
need to establish foundational knowledge and methodological skills in pediatric firearm injury prevention
science; (2) the analysis of empirical data and a focus on theory building; and, (3) the use of multi-disciplinary
approaches to advance stronger team science methods in the field. The program will capitalize on the breadth
and depth of the research laboratories, clinical settings, academic programs, experienced faculty, and linkages
to multiple research networks and centers at the University of Michigan (UM), including the newly established
Firearm Injury Prevention Institute, to provide an unparalleled training environment for this training. The

10836555,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Pleiotropy is defined as the phenomenon in which one gene affects multiple distinct phenotypic features.
Although unbiased genomic analyses have unmasked its increasing prevalence in Mendelian and complex traits,
the full extent of pleiotropy and its molecular basis in humans remains elusive. In this proposal, we will leverage
two seemingly distinct developmental genetic conditions, Idiopathic Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism (IHH) and
Craniosynostosis (CS), as hallmark examples to study pleiotropy. IHH is a rare reproductive disorder caused by
defective embryonic migration and/or secretion of hypothalamic Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)
neurons. CS is a birth defect impacting craniofacial development in which one or more of the sutures of the skull
fuse prematurely. Several molecular cascades (e.g., FGF, Wnt, BMP, hedgehog, ephrin, and retinoic acid
signaling) are known to overlap during GnRH neurogenesis and vertebrate cranial suture fusion. Yet, in humans,
shared genetic etiology between IHH and CS has not been widely reported, with only recent appreciation of a
partial genetic overlap. Loss-of-function (LOF) FGFR1 mutations cause IHH, while gain-of-function FGFR1
mutations result in CS, offering a plausible underpinning for this pleiotropic observation (opposing variant
directional effect). By contrast, LOF mutations in TCF12 (encoding a pro-neural transcription factor) have been
shown previously to cause coronal CS in humans, and recently, we identified LOF TCF12 mutations as a novel
cause of IHH. Notably, we observed phenotypic co-occurrence of IHH and CS in TCF12 mutation carriers,
providing compelling evidence for developmental pleiotropy between IHH and CS. Building on these
observations, and the still largely unexplained biologic basis of IHH/CS pleiotropy, the overarching goal of this
proposal is to unravel the ensemble of shared molecular pathways that coregulate GnRH and cranial suture
development. Our strong investigative team, with complementary expertise in reproductive endocrinology,
craniofacial biology, human genetics, animal models of disease, and human clinical investigation will juxtapose
human studies (Mendelian disease and population cohorts) with relevant zebrafish models in three distinct Aims:
(1) We will define the shared molecular pathways between GnRH neurogenesis and cranial suture fusion using
genomic studies in human Mendelian cohorts with validation in transgenic zebrafish; (2) We will utilize differential
transcriptomic atlases from human cranial suture and relevant zebrafish GnRH and cartilage cell types to
discover novel genes for IHH and CS; and (3) We will utilize population biobanks, IHH, and CS cohorts to define
the full extent of phenotypic pleiotropy relating to genes linked to both traits. Defining the underlying mechanisms
of pleiotropy for CS and IHH will serve as a blueprint to elucidate further the genetic architecture of human
diseases; chart precise genotype-phenotype maps in Mendelian conditions and in population settings; and inform
precision therapies for optimal clinical care."

Cell metabolism is the collection of biochemical processes that support the bioenergetic, biosynthetic, and
signaling demands of life. While the biochemical composition of most major human metabolic pathways have
been defined, we do not yet have a strong understanding of how metabolic pathways are differentially utilized to
support the diverse needs of cells across cell states. Activation of cell proliferation is one such state that comes
with substantial changes to metabolic pathway activities, however many of the mechanisms by which these
metabolic changes support cell proliferation, and the consequences of their disruption, remain unknown. At the
heart of cell metabolism is the mitochondrion, a double membrane bound organelle that serves as a metabolic
hub by providing a separate biochemical compartment from the cytosol and through the unique metabolic
capabilities afforded by the electron transport chain (ETC). While most famous for its role in ATP synthesis,
studies from us and others have determined that mitochondrial metabolism is essential for supporting cell
proliferation independent of ATP production. These findings have upended the traditional view of mitochondria
as mere “powerhouses” and underscore the need for a new, holistic understanding of how mitochondria support
cell functions. Our work has identified that complex I of the ETC is critical for cell proliferation by regenerating
electron acceptors, which support the synthesis of the amino acid aspartate. In addition, our preliminary data
uncover that the metabolic effects of impairments to complex II of the ETC are distinct from those of complex I,
and we identify a novel, redox-driven mitochondrial metabolic pathway necessary for cell proliferation upon
complex II dysfunction. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the metabolic contributions of
mitochondrial processes to cell proliferation remains lacking. My research program uses state-of-the-art
approaches to delineate the metabolic and functional consequences of disruptions to mitochondrial processes
to gain a new, systems level understanding of how the interconnected metabolic pathways in mitochondria
support cell proliferation. Notably, disruptions to mitochondrial function in humans have highly diverse clinical
manifestations and so mechanistic understanding of the consequences of impairments to different mitochondrial
processes will support the development of novel, targeted therapeutic approaches for the many diseases
associated with mitochondrial dysregulation, including inborn errors of metabolism, cancer, neurodegeneration,
aging, and others."

Determinants of Elderly Health: The Role of Place-Based Factors
 The goal of the proposed research is to better understand the factors affecting the health and health
behaviors of the elderly population in the United States by moving beyond the work of the prior grant, which
aggregated analysis of elderly healthcare utilization, to look directly at health behaviors and health outcomes.
As recent work has shown, there are large disparities in life expectancy among the Medicare population by
race, income, and geography, despite access to the same universal health insurance program. By examining
two potential broad-based forces, person-specific factors (“health capital”), which can include genetic
endowments as well as prior medical care, and place-based factors (“current place effects”), which is the
environment associated with their current location, we hope to gather findings that will greatly enrich not only
our understanding of the factors that affect the elderly’s health behaviors and health, but also shed light on the
likely efficacy of alternative policies aimed at improving elderly health behaviors and health.
 To accomplish this goal, the proposal has three central Aims. In Aim 1, we focus on a specific, harmful
health behavior: opioid addiction. The elderly population uses prescription opioids at a higher rate than any
other age group, therefore suggesting that this crisis is acute among the elderly and may worsen as the near-
elderly continue to age. By analyzing person-specific factors, such as mental health status and prior
substance abuse, as well as place-specific factors, including availability of physicians willing to prescribe
opioids for what they perceive as legitimate reasons or the presence of policies such as prescription monitoring
programs intended to limit abuse, we hope to gain a better understanding of both the causes of the opioid
crisis and the likely impacts of policies designed to combat it.
 In the second part of the proposed renewal, we will extend beyond the empirical methodology
employed in Aim 1 to focus on the role of place-based factors in two specific ways. In Aim 2, we will analyze
the impact of place-based factors on elderly mortality. In Aim 3, we will analyze the role of place-based factors
in contributing to health disparities among the elderly population. It is critical to understand the relative roles of
current place effects and person-specific factors in contributing to elderly mortality and elderly mortality
disparities in order to more fully understand the factors that may lead to elderly mortality and the likely effects
of policies on elderly health. Through these aims we hope to gain a clearer understanding of how person-
specific and place-specific factors affect the health behaviors and health outcomes of the elderly population in
the United States."

Malaria remains one of the most important global health challenges, with an estimated 247 million cases and
619,000 deaths in 2021, of which 95% of cases and 96% of deaths were in the WHO Africa region. The scale
up of proven control interventions resulted in significant reductions in the burden of malaria following the turn of
the century. However, since 2015 progress has stalled and even reversed course in some of the highest
burden countries of Africa. Indeed, a myriad of challenges, including the spread of insecticide resistance,
changes in vector composition and behavior, the emergence of artemisinin partial resistance, and the COVID-
19 pandemic have created a precarious situation. Our program called “PRISM” has been based in Uganda,
representing the East African region for the International Centers of Excellence for Malaria Research network.
Uganda is emblematic of the challenges faced by high burden countries, where routine surveillance systems
are inadequate to assess trends in the burden of malaria or to monitor the impact of control interventions.
Through PRISM we have implemented a comprehensive malaria surveillance program including enhanced
health facility-based surveillance and detailed longitudinal studies. Complementary laboratory-based studies
include surveillance for markers of antimalarial drug and insecticide resistance and serologic measures of
malaria exposure. These studies have greatly improved our understanding of the epidemiology of malaria in
Uganda and of the impact of control interventions. In this renewal application we propose to continue key
components of our health facility and community-based malaria surveillance to strategically focus on
quantifying the impact of malaria control interventions, working in close collaboration with our partners at the
Uganda National Malaria Control Division (NMCD). We will utilize specimens collected from our surveillance
system to generate genomic and serologic data to address key questions about malaria epidemiology,
transmission, diagnostics, and antimalarial drug and insecticide resistance. The central theme of our program
will be to improve malaria surveillance to better assess the impact of malaria control interventions and guide
evidence-based utilization of existing and novel interventions to reduce the malaria burden using an adaptive
approach. The program will consist of three research projects linked together in an integrated manner to
maximize scientific discovery. Research Project 1 (Surveillance and Impact Evaluation Project) will utilize
health facility and community-based malaria surveillance data from sites with varied transmission intensity and
control interventions to monitor trends, estimate the impact of interventions, and provide clinical data and
specimens for our other research projects. Research Project 2 (Resistance Project) we will characterize the
evolution of genotypic markers of drug and insecticide resistance and assess the impacts of resistance on
malaria transmission. Research Project 3 (Molecular Epidemiology Project) will characterize key parasite and
vector genomic traits and human serological responses."

Recent discoveries implicate specific genetic variants that confer extremely high risk for schizophrenia (SZ), a
devastating psychiatric syndrome. Alongside these genetic discoveries there have been parallel advances in
molecular neuroscience, including induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell technology; high-throughput cellular
technologies such as high content imaging and single cell genomics; and multiplex “cell village” approaches.
These techniques allow for rigorous yet efficient interrogation of complex biological processes in previously
inaccessible human neuronal cell types. The combination of genetic findings and technological advances are
powerful tools for addressing what has become the “great white whale” of modern psychiatry: What is the
underlying pathophysiology that gives rise to a SZ phenotype? We propose that high penetrance of rare SZ
mutations derive from large effects at the molecular and cellular levels. We will identify downstream targets and
pathways impacted by five rare SZ-associated variants with large effect sizes: deletions at chromosomal
locations 2p16 (localized to the NRXN1 gene), 3q29, 15q13.3, 22q11.2, and duplication at 16p11. A key strength
of this proposal is our access to the Genomic Psychiatry Cohort (GPC). Importantly, the GPC is a diverse cohort
with significant representation of African ancestry. We will select for study previously-banked cryopreserved
lymphocytes from individuals with SZ who carry one of these five defined variants (n=20 each genotype),
prioritizing underrepresented minorities, to generate iPS cell lines. A clear advantage of the GPC is its large
diverse control sample, allowing us to select controls (n=40) that are matched by genomic background to the SZ
cases, increasing the rigor of our study. A consistent but surprising observation about these SZ-associated rare
variants is their similarity in both effect size and phenotypic characteristics, giving rise to the hypothesis that
these variants converge on downstream molecular targets and/or cellular pathways. We will test the hypothesis
that SZ-associated rare mutations cause molecular perturbations in neurons at the level of chromatin
accessibility and gene expression and that genes or pathways impacted by two or more of these SZ-associated
variants converge, with more overlap than expected by chance. Finally, we will validate molecular pathways
using multimodal cellular phenotypic levels of analysis. Identifying the specific biological processes that are
disrupted by SZ-associated loci will open a window into the complex molecular biology of this disorder. The
substrate for our mechanistic studies will include subjects with diverse genetic backgrounds that have been
historically underrepresented in genetic studies, ensuring that our results are generalizable to these communities,
who suffer disproportionately from adverse mental health outcomes. The tools and data generated herein will
support the mental health field aligning with NIMH priorities, lead to transformative insights into the neurobiology
of SZ, and uncover novel targets that may be a launch point for therapeutic discovery."

Signaling by cAMP plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity and memory. The b2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR)
forms a unique signaling complex with AMPARs that also includes Gs, adenylyl cyclase (AC), and the cAMP-
dependent kinase. Norepinephrine (NE) stimulates via β2AR -cAMP - PKA the phosphorylation of the AMPAR
GluA1 subunit on S845, promoting AMPAR trafficking to the postsynaptic membrane. A primary mechanism of
long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission, which underlies learning and memory, is the accumulation
of AMPAR at the postsynaptic site. Members of the Phosphodiesterase 4 family (PDE4A-D) curb cAMP signaling
by hydrolyzing cAMP. Sleep deprivation stimulates expression of the PDE4A isomer PDE4A5, which impairs
hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and knock down of PDE4A5 rescues learning deficits. Therefore,
pharmacological targeting of PDE4A5 may alleviate cognitive deficits in brain disorders. In Aim 1, we found that
PDE4A5 binds with its unique ~100 amino acid long N-terminus (NT) to the SH3 domain of PSD-95. PSD-95
anchors AMPARs. For the remainder of my PhD. I propose to define the functional role of PDE4A5 and its
association with PSD-95 in AMPAR receptor trafficking. For Aim 2, my postdoctoral position in another lab, I
consider expanding this project by employing advanced imaging methods for cAMP signaling and super
resolution analysis of AMPAR localization in postsynaptic nanodomains."

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is characterized by intense liver inflammation and injury in the setting of excess alcohol
ingestion. Cytokine and chemokine upregulation leads to immune cell infiltration and drives inflammation in AH.
Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) are an important source of chemokine expression in the liver and
participate in paracrine signaling to attract immune cells in a process termed “angiocrine signaling”. Pathway
analysis of AH liver RNA-sequencing suggests a potential role of IL17 in mediating LSEC angiocrine signaling.
IL17 is a cytokine involved in many autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Our preliminary data shows that
IL17 synergically stimulate CXCL chemokine production with TNF, but the underlying mechanism is not clear.
The regulation of IL17 production from T cells also requires further study. Super enhancers are DNA regulatory
elements that complex with target gene promoters to drive gene expression. Our previous work has highlighted
the role of super enhancers in AH inflammation response. Here, we hypothesize that LSECs increase
inflammatory chemokine expression and enhance immune cell transmigration into the liver parenchyma
in response to T cell IL17 upregulation by super enhancer activation. To test our hypothesis, we will employ
complementary cell biologic and in vivo approaches to study the following specific aims: Aim 1. LSECs enhance
CXCL1-dependent neutrophil transendothelial migration in response to IL17; Aim 2. Therapeutic
targeting of a super enhancer in T cells downregulates IL17 and ameliorates inflammation in AH. In Aim
1, we will explore the role of IκB𝜁, a transcription factor previously implicated in IL17 signaling, in mediating the
interaction between IL17 and TNF signaling pathways. We will also assess the transcriptomic changes of IL17
and TNF stimulation and IκB𝜁 silencing on LSECs by RNA-sequencing. Using microfluidic devices to simulate
liver microvascular circulation, we will directly observe the effects of IL17/TNF stimulation and IκB𝜁 inhibition
on neutrophil chemotaxis. In Aim 2, we will identify the IL17 super enhancer by chromosome conformation
capture assays. We will assess the feasibility of CRISPR-mediated sequence-specific suppression of the IL17
super enhancer. We will use a Cre dependent dCas9-KRAB knockin mice with AAV6 viral delivery of single guide
RNA to target the IL17 super enhancer in vivo. We aim to achieve T cell-specific suppression of IL17 expression
and assess its effect on AH inflammatory response in a murine model. Indeed, in vivo CRISPR gene-editing has
already been applied clinically to treat hereditary disorders, highlighting the translational promise of precision
genome-targeting therapies. Better understanding of the IL17 mediated angiocrine signaling process and IL17
super enhancer regulation may reveal novel therapeutic targets for treatment of AH. Therefore, our overall aims
and approaches are aligned with the mission of NIAAA to further understanding and treatment of alcohol-
associated liver diseases."

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related death in men in the United States. Many of the
newly diagnosed patients are indolent and would not die from prostate cancer even if they are left untreated. But
lack of reliable markers to identify such indolent tumors has led to overtreatment of patients. To minimize
overtreatment, patients with a lower Gleason Score are put on active surveillance and are not treated unless
there is sign of disease progression. Although such active surveillance can minimize over-treatment, it may miss
the opportunity for early intervention of aggressive tumors. Therefore, understanding molecular mechanisms
underlying the aggressive nature of prostate cancer and identifying prognostic markers to distinguish indolent
from aggressive prostate cancers are of great clinical significance. Human prostate cancers mostly originate in
the peripheral zone (PZ). In addition, transition zone (TZ) tumors are often associated with favorable pathological
features and better recurrence-free survival. These observations lead to the hypothesis that the differences in
tissue microenvironment between the two zones influence the frequency and aggressiveness of the resulting
tumors. We compared gene expression profiles between TZ and PZ stroma by an RNA-seq analysis and identify
the transcription factor FOXF2 as one of the top genes expressed at a higher level in TZ stromal cells. We
demonstrated that elevated Foxf2 expression in prostate stromal cells suppressed growth of prostate cancer
xenografts in vivo. In Aim1, we will use genetically engineered mouse models to confirm that stromal Foxf2-
mediated signaling suppresses tumor progression. In Aim 2, we will investigate the molecular mechanisms
through which stromal Foxf2 suppresses tumor progression. In Aim 3, we will investigate how stromal FOXF2
expression is regulated."

This project is rooted in the clinical observation that the blood diseases that affect infants, children, and adults differ. We hypothesize that that is due to developmental and age-related intrinsic differences in the fundamental properties of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Our research group is focused on understanding how temporal differences in HSPCs impact manifestation of blood diseases. The preliminary data supporting this proposal expand our prior studies on the role of the heterochronic Lin28b/let-7 axis in defining the maturation states of definitive HSPCs. Lin28b/let-7 acts as a molecular switch whereby Lin28b is expressed in the fetal state to implement hallmarks of juvenile hematopoiesis such as fetal globin expression, erythroid-biased output, and innate-like lymphocytes. Developmental downregulation of Lin28b releases let-7 microRNAs that target transcripts to establish mature adult myeloid-biased hematopoiesis. We have found that the Polycomb repressor complex 1 (PRC1) component Cbx2 is a target of let-7 microRNAs in the hematopoietic system and that PRC1 controls the expression of master hematopoietic transcription factors (TFs) such as Erg. On the basis of this finding, we hypothesize that histone H2A lysine 119 monoubiquitylation (H2AK119Ub) by PRC1 downstream of Lin28b/let-7 regulates the TF networks that control HSPC self-renewal and differentiation. This proposal aims to understand 1) how Lin28b is normally developmentally downregulated and how it may be aberrantly expressed in blood diseases with oncofetal gene expression such as myelodysplastic syndrome; and 2) how Erg, as a master hematopoietic TF, effects Lin28b/let-7/Cbx2’s control of hematopoietic maturation. Our experience in normal hematopoietic maturation, modeling of blood diseases, and the collaborations that we have established to complete this proposed research position us to answer these key questions, which we believe have immediate applications to better understanding age-biased blood diseases."
10850864,"The long-term objective of this project is to understand how genes specify the functioning of a behavioral
system. The anatomically simple neuromuscular system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans consists
of diverse types of neurons and muscles while being sufficiently small and simple to allow a complete
description of its cells, cell lineage, and neural connectivity, facilitating the identification and analysis of
anatomical, developmental, and functional abnormalities caused by mutations. Studies of the C. elegans
egg-laying system and of the neuromuscular systems that control behaviors often coordinately regulated
with egg laying, such as locomotion and feeding, offer opportunities for the analysis of a broad variety of
fundamental biological problems of relevance to many human disorders. The major issue that this project
will address is the mechanisms used by animals to respond to environmental cues and stresses. More
specifically, this project will determine how low oxygen levels and multichromatic light (color) affect C.
elegans egg-laying behavior and locomotion, respectively, and will use these C. elegans behaviors as
readouts to analyze important evolutionarily conserved pathways that respond to such cues and stresses.
The genetic, molecular, cellular, and neural-circuit bases of these responses will be defined. The major
focus will be on mechanisms that mediate behavioral responses to oxygen deprivation, which profoundly
affects cellular and organismic physiology in humans and is responsible for the cardiac damage in heart
attacks as well as for ischemic damage to the kidneys, nervous system and other organs. The evolutionarily
conserved EGLN/HIF pathway mediates responses to oxygen deprivation, has been implicated in many
human disorders, and has defined major therapeutic targets for cancer. This aim will identify new
components of this important pathway and reveal how this pathway acts both broadly and with cell-type
specificity to control animal physiology and behavior. The second and more exploratory aim will determine
how, despite lacking eyes and opsins (the class of photoreceptor proteins thought to be essential for color
discrimination), C. elegans can distinguish different colors. Color detection is used by animals of diverse
phyla to sense and respond to colorful natural environments. The proposed studies of the responses of C.
elegans to multichromatic light will address a fundamental and intriguing biological question: what
mechanisms allow cells that lack opsins to respond to multichromatic light? More specifically, this aim will
determine how the evolutionarily conserved Epithelial Sodium Channel (ENaC), which in mammals is crucial
for fluid and ion homeostasis, functions in C. elegans to mediate responses to colored light. These studies
should both reveal novel aspects of ENaC channel regulation and function and provide novel insights into
opsin-independent photobiological responses, which are displayed by a variety of light-sensitive non-visual
human cells, including the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells of the mammalian eye."
10850991,"Framed by the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST), and building on our recent
preliminary studies, we are requesting 5 years of support to conduct an optimization trial among
people who inject drugs (PWID) and newly enrolled on medication for opioid use disorder
(MOUD). The goal is to assess the performance of four intervention components (Attention,
Executive Functioning, Memory, and Information Processing) aimed at enhancing the ability of
PWID on MOUD to process and utilize evidence-based HIV prevention content, leading to
improvements in Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) adherence and HIV risk reduction. Existing
evidence-based interventions require participants to have at least moderate levels of cognitive
functioning but do not acknowledge or accommodate participants with cognitive dysfunction.
This is a crucial weakness as cognitive dysfunction is a common feature among PWID, and one
that can directly impede their ability to process and utilize intervention content. In fact, our
recent studies comparing objective and self-report cognitive assessments (e.g., NIH toolbox)
show that ~67% of PWID experience substantial levels of cognitive dysfunction across tasks
involving attention, executive function, memory, and information processing that, in turn,
disrupt the expected intervention outcomes (e.g., medication adherence, HIV risk reduction).
Our recent work also suggests that PWID newly enrolled on MOUD would benefit from an
intervention approach that incorporates ‘compensatory strategies’ to accommodate their
cognitive dysfunction. A number of well-established compensatory strategies have been
successfully applied to other patient populations (e.g., traumatic brain injury, ADHD,
Alzheimer’s/dementia) and have been identified by our team as promising intervention
components that could enhance evidence-based PrEP-focused primary HIV prevention
approaches targeting PWID on MOUD. To date, however, no studies have examined the
potential impact and cost of incorporating such intervention components, either individually or
in various combinations, in terms of enhancing PWID’s ability to process and utilize HIV
prevention content. This innovative trial will be the first to use the MOST framework to optimize
an evidence-based HIV prevention approach by compensating for cognitive features that are
characteristic of PWID on MOUD, and maximizing PrEP adherence outcomes within real world
budget constraints."
10917309,"This proposal addresses fundamental issue of specificity and generality of training in the context of Perceptual
Learning (PL). PL broadly encompasses the set of mechanisms through which experience with the
environment gives rise to changes in perceptual processing. The potential broader impacts of PL are immense.
Careful research in this domain can greatly enhance our basic understanding of the perceptual systems and
the plasticity of these systems. Furthermore, translational approaches underpinned by the basic science of PL
are becoming increasingly prominent. This includes a host of emerging translational approaches for the
rehabilitation of both perceptual deficits and for cognitive training, which are believed to share cortical plasticity
mechanisms. However, while existing research provides evidence that PL approaches can improve perceptual
skills, our ability to develop effective interventions is limited by a lack of understanding of the behavioral
outcomes associated with different PL approaches. Here we suggest that to understand and maximally exploit
PL, it is necessary to know how training with different tasks and in different individuals gives rise to different
outcomes. One major obstacle to successful translation of PL is that the field to-date has been strongly driven
by “novel” and “provocative” findings demonstrated via small N studies with very few projects digging deep to
achieve robust and reliable results. In turn, not surprisingly, the field of PL, like many others in psychology, has
suffered from numerous replication challenges. Furthermore, perhaps because following in direct footsteps
runs counter to the tendencies noted above, it is surprisingly rare for different research groups to use identical
training tasks or outcome tests. This is problematic given research showing that small changes in task-
procedures can give rise to large differences in learning outcome. Here we overcome these limitations by
comparing a large number of different training tasks using common outcome measures and in a large subject
population. Each of these tasks involves a different “critical feature” for learning proposed by a given research
group. However, these tasks have never been directly compared or contrasted. The outcome of the proposed
research will be of tremendous value to both basic understanding of PL as well as how to translate PL to help
those with visual needs. We will achieve robust and reliable results by training a large sample of participants
on PL tasks and assess the outcomes via a common set of measures. We will also collect a broad assessment
of individual differences, which will provide a unique dataset that can resolve controversies in the literature and
lead to new understandings. Our proposed analytical approach tests central key hypothesis in the field,
explores the extent to which different training approaches leads to systematically different profiles of learning,
and examines how these can differ based upon the individuals being trained. Further by releasing our training
and testing tools as well as the data collected, we will enable other groups to model results, replicate our
studies, and make well specified modifications of training tasks with known outcomes to guide future research."

appointing each trainee for 2-3 years. The broad mission of the proposed program is to focus research and
professional skills development on underrepresented Ph.D. trainees at CCNY while also providing
beneficial impact for our broader population of trainees and mentors in STEM disciplines. Our specific
objectives and strategies are as follows:
 · To recruit and retain talented minority Ph.D. trainees whose biomedical research interests align
 with the participating CCNY faculty-led teams. Vigorous recruitment will be coupled with
 sustained mentee-mentor matching, development of sound cohort and research identity, and
 provision of a supportive and inclusive training environment.
 · To offer rigorous didactic training that combines disciplinary depth with interdisciplinary breadth
 while progressively building independent research design skills. Interdisciplinary degree tracks
 and co-teaching will be emphasized.
 · To provide robust research training that fosters individual skills and creativity, cooperation within
 a research group, synergy among research groups, and the use of state-of-the-art technology to
 address important open issues in the biomedical sciences.
 · To offer structured research-related activities that build STEM research identity and ethical values,
 an inclusive and supportive G-RISE cohort, career-ready skill sets and focus.
 · To achieve trainee outcomes that include enhanced numbers and proportions of UR Ph.D.’s who
 achieve timely graduation in biomedical science and engineering disciplines, while also improving
 each trainee’s technical and communication skills, research productivity, and post-Ph.D. placement
 in the workforce.
In the proposed project, a strategic combination of NIH and institutional resources will allow us to improve

Copper is an essential trace element utilized by eukaryotic cells as an enzymatic redox cofactor. At high
concentrations the metal is toxic, and complex homeostatic mechanisms have developed to ensure that
it is maintained at the correct physiological level. Prokaryotes such as gram negative pathogens have a
diminished requirement for the metal, and show sensitivity to copper at levels well tolerated by
mammalian cells. For this reason, macrophages utilize pathogenic copper toxicity as part of their
defense against invaders while the latter combat the host-defense by upregulating their exporter
machinery. Our research is focused on the mechanisms of copper transport and catalysis and is divided
into three separate but overlapping projects. Project 1 examines the reaction mechanism of
mononuclear monooxygenases exemplified by peptidylglycine monooxygenase (PHM), the only enzyme
capable of installing the critical post-translational amide into peptide hormones. We have identified three
important unanswered questions – (i) the pathway for electron transfer (ii) the chemical speciation of
reaction intermediates and (iii) the mechanism of substrate triggering, and have designed an approach
for interrogating each. Project 2 focuses on the mechanism of pathogenic copper export via a study of
the CusCBAF exporter of E. coli. Here we use a novel labeling approach to track the flux of metal ions as
they move through the pump. We build on recent results that have successfully determined the role
CusF and CusB in metalating CusA, the rates of copper transfer from CusF to CusB, and the identity of
the CusF-CusB complex as a shared ligand intermediate. Unanswered questions include the
mechanism of CusF to CusA metal exchange, the role of metal-binding residues in selectivity and
efficiency, and the function of the novel His2Phe Cu(I)/Ag(I) binding site in the CusS regulator. Project 3
takes our program into new territory by investigating structure/function of the newly discovered copper-
dependent kinases MEK1/2 and ULK1/2 involved in cell signaling and tumorogenesis. The integrated
approach to all three projects leverages the Pi's track record in developing toolsets that can interrogate
the chemistry of copper, but particularly the Cu(I) state which reacts with oxygen, and is the form in
which copper is trafficked in the cell. Two aspects of this effort are of particular utility: (i) development of
metal-directed probes of Cu(I) coordinate structure utilizing x-ray absorption and emission
spectroscopies and (ii) development of labeling strategies utilizing selenomethionine substitution coupled
to Se K EXAFS. The expected outcome of the research is a better understanding of how biology
leverages the fundamental chemistry of copper to achieve functionality, recognizing that function requires
balance between the requirements for selective metalation, the structural determinants of catalysis, and
pathogenic virulence induced by robust bacterial export pumps."
10828865,"Tendons can withstand large forces due to a highly aligned, dense collagen matrix. However, their low
cellularity and relative inability to recruit reparative cells post-injury, as well as susceptibility to excessive
scarring results in loss of tendon structure and mechanical function. Type I collagen (Col1) is the primary
collagen of healthy tendon and type III collagen (Col3) is a minor constituent that increases in response to
injury. In other Col1-rich tissues such as skin and bone, Col3 directs reparative cell activities by regulating
early cellular infiltration to promote healing, as well as collagen deposition, architecture and crosslink
formation, supporting an early critical role of Col3 in wound healing, which has not been studied in tendon.
Adding to the importance of understanding a role for Col3 in tendon, Col3 levels in aging tissues are reduced
and in aged tendon, we have shown inferior healing which raises the possibility that age-induced Col3 loss
increases susceptibility to poor tendon healing in aging populations. While Col3 may orchestrate cellular
activities and fate that are critical for an optimal reparative response post-injury at early stages in tendon, its
persistent expression in the remodeling phase may compromise the desired healing response. Therefore, our
overall objective is to delineate mechanisms by which the temporal expression of Col3 modulates the injury
response throughout tendon healing, as well as its differential effect throughout aging. Specifically, we will test
the hypothesis that Col3 is crucial for early tendon healing, but that its continued expression during remodeling
is detrimental. To test this, we generated a novel inducible Col3 deficient (i.e., Col3a1F/+, Col3a1F/F) mouse
model to determine the dose-dependent effects of Col3 by temporal targeting of Col3. Using this approach, we
will define the regulatory roles of Col3 throughout tendon healing at the time of injury, during the early
proliferative phase, and during remodeling. In addition, by knockdown of Col3 in young, middle-aged, and old
animals, we will evaluate the effects of aging on tendon healing with altered Col3. Understanding the role of
Col3 throughout healing will lead to clinically relevant insights to improve outcomes following tendon injury in
patients of varying ages. The study aims are: Aim 1: To define the age-sensitive mechanistic role(s) of Col3
throughout tendon healing by knocking down Col3 at the time of tendon injury. Aim 2: To elucidate the age-
sensitive mechanistic role(s) of Col3 in directing reparative cell activities and prolonged effects of knocking
down Col3 during the proliferative phase of tendon healing. Aim 3: To define the age-sensitive mechanistic
role(s) of Col3 in tendon repair by knocking down Col3 during the remodeling phase of tendon healing. This
study will define the critical temporal roles of Col3 in response to tendon injury throughout aging. We will utilize
a novel mouse model coupled with rigorous hierarchical structure/function assays to define the role of Col3 in
directing interplay between cellular activities and matrix assembly/organization in tendon healing."

We propose a high-impact, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, mechanistic clinical trial aimed at
elucidating the basis for the wide heterogeneity in severity of and treatment responses in persons with allergic
rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC) and allergic asthma (AA). AA and ARC are highly prevalent, environmentally triggered
and often comorbid conditions that share mechanistic correlates. We will study persons with house dust mite
(HDM)-associated PARC and AA, termed HDM+PARC+AA+. HDMs are influential in AA/ARC pathogenesis and
disease severity. To investigate mechanisms that may contribute to heterogeneity, we capitalized on an
aeroallergen challenge chamber (ACC), a unique and relatively rare resource, which allows for controlled
exposures to disease triggers of ARC/AA. Challenge studies with a fixed dose of HDM in persons with HDM-
associated PARC without AA evoked (i) maladaptive (persistently higher ARC symptoms), (ii) adaptive
(progressive symptom reduction with repeated challenges), and (ii) resilient (resistance to symptom induction)
phenotypes. Symptom severity in the natural environment was an imprecise correlate of the phenotypes.
Congruently, challenge studies in HDM+PARC+AA+ persons with HDMs in the ACC also evoked these
phenotypes. Mechanistic studies revealed that these phenotypes may relate to an imbalance between levels of
airway epithelial integrity and inflammation. To further test this concept, we will evaluate 88 HDM+PARC+AA+
persons with persistent mild-to-moderate asthma. The ACC will be used identify persons with the maladaptive
and adaptive phenotypes, defined by higher and lower symptom severity evoked in response to HDM exposures
in the ACC. Each phenotype strata will be randomized 1:1 and administered a 22-week course of dupilumab
(monoclonal antibody targeting IL-4 receptor alpha) or placebo. Exposure to HDMs in an ACC for 1 daily 5-hour
challenge will occur: 1) for phenotyping and baseline assessment of symptoms (pre-randomization), 2)
intermittently while on dupilumab/placebo administration for assessment of heterogeneity in responses to drug,
and 3) intermittently while off dupilumab/placebo for assessment of heterogeneity in the recrudescence in
symptoms. Mechanistic correlates of the upper airway (nasal) and systemic (peripheral blood) compartments
will be determined pre-treatment, on-treatment, and off-treatment. Thus, this clinical trial will test the hypothesis
that a 22-week course of dupilumab will attenuate AA/ARC symptoms in persistent mild-to-moderate allergic
asthmatic subjects by mitigating inflammation with or without fully restoring epithelial integrity. However, the rate
of symptom attenuation and recrudescence will be less and greater, respectively, in persons with the maladaptive
compared with adaptive phenotypes. Affirmation of this hypothesis will provide new insights into the mechanisms
underpinning heterogeneity in disease severity and treatment responses, as well as provide a basis to consider
multi-modal therapeutic interventions to achieve durable suppression of AA/ARC symptoms."

The G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and its cognate ligand CXCL12
have been linked to endothelial cell migration, a necessary part of angiogenesis in health and disease.
Specifically, arterial expression of CXCR4 promotes neovascularization of the heart following myocardial
infarction, reducing damage and leading to recovery, yet the mechanisms that control CXCR4 signaling remain
poorly understood. Better understanding of CXCR4 signaling could aid in developing improved therapeutics for
cardiovascular disease. CXCR4 abundance and signaling is regulated by the post-translational modification
termed ubiquitination, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. The objective of this project is to better
understand how ubiquitination governs CXCR4 signaling and trafficking. Stimulation with CXCL12 induces
ubiquitination of C-terminal lysine residues on CXCR4, serving as a sorting signal into the multi-vesicular
body/endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (MVB/ESCRT) pathway for subsequent degradation
in lysosomes leading to downregulation of signaling. In addition, agonist activation of CXCR4 promotes
ubiquitination of STAM1, a component of the ESCRT-0 complex. Ubiquitination of STAM1 requires the
endocytic adaptor proteins b-arrestin1 and is implicated in regulating CXCR4 trafficking and signaling. Despite
this pivotal role very little is known concerning STAM1 ubiquitination. Preliminary data suggest that b-arrestin1
increases ubiquitination of STAM1 by the E3 ubiquitin ligase AIP4, consistent with b-arrestin1 serving as an
adaptor for STAM1 ubiquitination. Mass spectroscopy analysis revealed that STAM1 is modified by ubiquitin at
several lysine residues and with potentially multiple types of ubiquitin linkages. Remarkably, one of the
ubiquitin linkages corresponded to linear or Met1-linked ubiquitin chains, a linkage type only previously known
to form by the E3 ligase complex LUBAC in the context of NFkB signaling. Further biochemical studies suggest
that b-arrestin1 is required for M1-linked linear ubiquitin chain formation at a specific lysine residue on STAM1
by AIP4. Based on the preliminary data, we hypothesize that b-arrestin1 coordinates lysine selection by AIP4
to mediate linear ubiquitination of STAM1. To test this hypothesis, we will use several biochemical, molecular
and biophysical approaches (Aim 1) to identify and characterize site-specific linear ubiquitination of STAM1 by
b-arrestin1 via AIP4 and (Aim 2) to determine the role of linear poly-ubiquitin chains on GPCR trafficking and
signaling. At the conclusion of the project, we will have identified an unexpected role for M1-linked ubiquitin
chains in GPCR signaling and trafficking. This project will be carried out at the Medical College of Wisconsin
under the mentorship of Dr. Adriano Marchese, an expert on the role of ubiquitin on GPCR signaling and
trafficking. The sponsor lab and the overall scientific community at the Medical College of Wisconsin provides
an outstanding environment to successfully complete the proposed studies."
10834053,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Current therapies for patients with advanced or metastatic pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PGL/PCC) are
not curative and there are no known molecular or genetic markers to predict penetrance of primary or metastatic
disease. Although most patients have sporadic tumors, up to 40% have a hereditary cause for their PGL/PCC,
with at least 12 different susceptibility genes identified. The Succinate Dehydrogenase Subunit (SDH) genes
form complex II of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and are involved with the Kreb’s cycle converting succinate
to fumarate. Germline pathogenic variants in any of the SDHx genes increases risk of developing Hereditary
PGL/PCC Syndrome. This syndrome is defined by the development of multifocal primary PGL/PCC, renal cell
carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. The penetrance for the disease in carriers of SDHx pathogenic
germline variants varies per gene. Furthermore, there are no predictive markers for primary tumor development
or metastatic disease. This gap in understanding between genotype and phenotype makes clinical
recommendations for screening and surveillance difficult and creates an unmet need in the field. The goals of
this proposal are to identify genetic risk loci for developing PGL/PCC to better understand the etiology of the
cancer and to identify genetic modifiers for SDHx-associated PGL/PCC to be directly translatable to clinical care
for prediction of cancer risk and prognosis as well as identification of therapeutic targets for cancer prevention
and treatment. Leveraging the international American-Australian-Asian Adrenal Alliance (A5) consortium, we
have assembled the largest known sample set of 1740 germline DNAs and matched clinical data from patients
with sporadic and SDHx-associated PGL/PCC as well as patients with germline SDHx pathogenic variants
without PGL/PCC. In Aim 1, we will determine the inherited genetic risk loci for PGL/PCC to better understand
the genetic etiology of the cancer by performing a case control genome-wide SNP analysis. In Aim 2, we will
determine inherited genetic risk modifiers for SDHx pathogenic variant carriers to develop PGL/PCC by
performing a case-control study between SDHx carriers with and without disease. Aim 3 focuses on rare variants
within the SDH complex which may be modifiers for SDHB-associated PGL/PCC. SDHB carriers are at highest
risk for developing metastatic disease. Finally, using several methods including eQTL analysis and regulatory
element analysis, we will identify the most likely causal variants to test with in vitro functional assays. Successful
identification of genetic modifiers for sporadic or SDHx-associated PGL/PCC will have direct translation to clinical
care by identifying those at highest risk for a personalized screening approach and identifying targets for cancer
prevention and therapeutic intervention."

There is a growing recognition that many of the most pressing challenges of our time require a coordinated
transdisciplinary approach. Over the last two decades insights have been gained about what successful
transdisciplinary collaboration looks like; however, creating space to apply these known successful
transdisciplinary best practices is still hard to achieve. Barriers to applying transdisciplinary methods to
data-intensive research remain formidable - particularly the lack of resources for training and/or
cross-disciplinary capacity-building. The social aspects of a collaboration are often neglected. Additionally,
much about the methods for evaluating collaboration and the multivariate effects of individual and team
characteristics on collaboration efficacy are poorly understood and are active areas of research. As a
consequence of these gaps in knowledge and resources, large biomedical consortia often fall short of their
objectives. In our experience on dozens of such projects (and based on years of team science research
literature), failure results from a lack of shared understanding about the goals coupled with ambiguous
governance processes and/or misaligned incentives. Programs focusing on AI are at particular risk because of
their need for innovations across multiple disciplinary boundaries to support specific AI applications. To avoid
these pitfalls and advance our understanding of team science we will engage in the following aims:
Aim 1. Design and implement Collaborative Agreement to foster sound governance across Bridge2AI.
Here we propose to establish policy and process for effective transdisciplinary research based on best
practices.
Aim 2. Realize inclusive, integrative team science across the BRIDGE community and beyond. Here we
propose to provide training and guidance to meet the specific needs of the BRIDGE community.
Aim 3. Evaluate efficacy and impact of teaming across Bridge2AI and communicate lessons learned.
Here we propose to collect data describing Bridge2AI collaborations and their effectiveness for the purpose of
improving the BRIDGE community and advancing the science of team science."
10836006,"BRIDGE Center Standards Core Project Summary
AI offers great potential for the discovery of novel biomedical insights from linkages between disparate,
cross-domain datasets. Unfortunately, traditional hypothesis-driven datasets tend to be narrowly focused on
the targeted problem domain with little consideration to “AI-readiness”. To best enable the use of such datasets
in data-driven and cross-domain discovery, they must be made Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and
Reusable (FAIR). Lack of FAIRness is particularly problematic for AI, which is data-hungry. To fully leverage the
power of AI approaches, researchers need to find and reuse data to combine into larger datasets, and the data
must be interoperable or harmonized to be combined meaningfully. Transforming pre-existing datasets into
AI-ready data is challenging, requiring extensive linking and curation by human experts. This challenge is
exacerbated when annotating and linking data across domains, where standards may be disparate in purpose
and specificity. Finally, many datasets do not adhere to best practices in data transparency, including content
attribution and conditions on distribution and reuse. These additional considerations of Traceability, Licensing,
and Connectedness create an operationalized model for FAIR: FAIR-TLC.
Overcoming the barriers to FAIR-TLC is key to translational science and AI-driven biomedical discovery. Our
team has led standards development efforts in numerous large consortia, including the GA4GH, HL7, and
N3C. Our standards for representing biomedical concepts have been widely adopted, including those for
human phenotypes (e.g., HPO, GA4GH Phenopackets), diseases (NCIt, Mondo, ICD-11), genes (Gene
Ontology), anatomy (Uberon), and molecular variation (GA4GH VRS). We have developed standards and tools
to address data provenance (SEPIO), contributions (Contributor Attribution Model), licensing barriers (Data
Use Ontology, Reusable Data Project), and connectivity (Linked data Model Language, LinkML).
We will build on our previous work, collaborative skills, and technical knowledge to develop a framework to
enable the harmonization of standards across biomedical domains. We will form working groups with
representatives of the Data Generation Projects (DGPs) to document use cases and synthesize data standard
requirements. We will provide protocols and training for specifying standards, and provide concierge services
in support of all deliverables and activities. We will create a version-controlled Bridge2AI Standards Registry to
inventory standards for use by the DGPs, specified in the modality-agnostic LinkML framework, discoverable
through the interactive Standards Hub, and automatically exportable to technical artifacts through our Data
Transformation Toolbox. We will build a Standards Evaluation Dashboard for assessment and discovery of
standards in datasets from Bridge2AI Data Generation Projects. We will promote best practices in the
transparent and responsible sharing of datasets and ML models through DUO, Datasheets, and Model Cards."

A considerable number of clinical, neuropathological, immunohistochemical and immunological studies suggest
that human brain cells, in particular those of myeloid origin, are susceptible to HIV-1; infection of these cells may
contribute to neurocognitive dysfunction and viral long-term persistence despite ART. However, among all
anatomical tissue locations in the human body, the central nervous system (CNS) arguably represents the most
difficult one to access and to evaluate for viral infection and persistence. Recently, significant progress has been
made in defining viral reservoirs using novel next-generation sequencing approaches, frequently allowing viral
sequence profiling at single-genome or single-cell resolution. Using such technologies, it is possible to profile
the evolutionary dynamics of viral species in the CNS in great detail, and to obtain rare insight into the underlying
mechanisms and pathways that influence HIV-1 reservoir establishment and persistence in the CNS. Here, we
propose a collaborative, interdisciplinary research project involving investigators with complementary experience
in neurology, neuropathology, virology, computational modeling and clinical care of HIV-1 patients to advance
the current understanding of the CNS as an anatomical site for long-term persistence of replication-competent
HIV-1. In specific aim 1, we will leverage a unique collection of paired CSF and plasma samples from
longitudinally-followed, untreated HIV-1 patients to evaluate phylogenetic associations and interrelated viral
population genomics between viral sequences from the CNS and alternative anatomical compartments; these
studies will be instrumental for tracking the seeding and establishment of long-lasting viral reservoirs pre-ART.
In specific aim 2, we will use autopsy material from ART-treated HIV-1 patients with suppressed viremia at death
to profile the frequency, clonality, chromosomal location and replication competence of proviruses isolated from
sorted CNS cells, in particular from myeloid parenchymal microglia, from myeloid perivascular macrophages and
astrocytes. Together, these studies will allow for a deep characterization of HIV-1 reservoir cell dynamics in the
CNS, and may be informative for future clinical strategies aiming at HIV-1 eradication and cure."

 SAR441236 is a tri-specific HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) that combines
the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) specificity of VRC01-LS, the V1/V2 glycan-directed binding of
PGDM1400, and the gp41 MPER binding of 10E8v4 into one antibody molecule (1). This
trispecific bnAb has greater potency and breadth than any single bnAb and provided complete
protection to macaques against intra-rectal challenge by a mixture of SHIVs.
 The advantages of a three-in-one bnAb, when compared to three separate monospecific
bnAbs administered in combination, are the potential to improve efficacy and simplify prevention
and treatment regimens, possibly improving patient adherence. ACTG A5377 is a phase I first-
in-human study of SAR441236 that investigates this novel trispecific bnAb in viremic and
aviremic participants with HIV.
 Administration of an HIV-1 bnAb could affect reservoir dynamics through two
mechanisms: 1) a direct antiviral effect that clears residual virions and infected cells, and/or 2)
indirect effects that improve anti-HIV surveillance and immune function. The scientific premise
of this proposal is that treatment with SAR441236 during suppressed infection selectively
prunes the HIV-1 proviral landscape and affects immune system function, directly or indirectly,
to improve HIV-1 control. The goals of this proposal are to determine if trispecific bnAb
treatment during suppressive ART impacts the HIV-1 provirus landscape and to define what
effects, if any, trispecific bnAb administration has on the immune system and the anti-HIV
immune response.
 We hypothesize that SAR441236 leads to the selective loss of intact provirus variants,
modulates Treg and antigen presenting cell (APC) function, and improves cytolytic immune
responses to HIV-1. Specific Aims of this proposal are to investigate SAR441236 selection
pressure on the HIV-1 reservoir, define the effects of SAR441236 on the peripheral immune
system epigenome, transcriptome and cell surface proteome at single cell resolution, and to
understand the effects of SAR441236 on cytolytic immune responses – CD8+ T cells and NK
cells - to enhance reservoir clearance. Our approaches build on novel technologies to test
previously unexplored hypotheses that are central to understand how treatment with
SAR441236 influences the HIV-1 proviral reservoir and the peripheral immune system."

Minorities remain underrepresented in aging-research-related professions, including demography and
economics of aging, health, and health care. In health services research (HSR), which studies the
organization, financing, and delivery of health care and provides an evidence base that is central to addressing
issues of care quality, access, affordability, and equity, Blacks and Hispanics accounting for only 6.9% and
3.7%, respectively, of the HSR workforce.[1] In economics there has been an almost 20-year stagnation in the
number of degrees, Bachelors or Doctorate, awarded to women and underrepresented minorities, despite
improvements in other STEM fields.[2] Yet underrepresented researchers bring essential diverse perspectives
and, often, personal experiences to bear in understanding the social, economic, political, and environmental
determinants of racial and ethnic disparities in health and health care.
Pipeline programs in aging are critical to providing more diversity in the workforce as well as to developing
creative, culturally appropriate and sensitive solutions to issues associated with racial and ethnic health
disparities in aging populations. We propose a new pipeline program, Get Experience in Aging Research
Undergraduate Program (GEAR UP), in order to develop talented underrepresented minorities seeking
research careers with a focus in the demography and economics of aging, health, and health care, and
particularly health disparities in diverse communities. Building on the innovations in Penn’s Population Aging

in the demography and economics of aging, health, and health care by providing exciting mentored research
experiences to undergraduates for two consecutive summers, supplemented with programming throughout the
academic year. This 15-month program provides students an opportunity to grow and enhance the skills in
their toolbox, enrich their relationships with mentors and colleagues, and get more deeply involved and
committed to aging research. The goal of this program is to motivate undergraduate scholars to dedicate their
lives to addressing societal problems through research."

Activated protein C (APC) is a naturally occurring plasma serine protease that has been translated to the clinic
as a recombinant wild type or mutant biologic. In a diverse collection of preclinical animal injury models,
pharmacologic APC’s provides many benefits. APC and the protein C systems contribute to the regulation of
thromboinflammation that is critical for host defense, including defense versus SARS-CoV-2 infection. APC can
act on diverse cell types, including immune cells for suppression of graft-versus-host disease. APC not only has
anticoagulant activity but also initiates cell signaling via multiple receptors, in particular, via several protease
activated receptors (PAR). APC-initiated cell signaling contributes to tissue homeostasis and host defense
systems. Beneficial APC-initiated biased signaling is caused by specific cleavages of PAR1 and PAR3, and for
some critical biologic activities, e.g., reducing mortality in sepsis, APC requires the integrin, Mac-1. Despite
recent insights, there is a major gap in knowledge about protein-protein interactions between APC and its cellular
receptors. Aim 1 studies will use a very extensive library of > five dozen recombinant APC mutants to provide a
database regarding APC’s receptor specificities which will then enable engineering of APC mutants with
receptor-specific selectivity, e.g., an APC mutant with highly selective PAR1-specific or PAR3-specific signaling
capabilities or selectively specific for the I-domain of Mac-1. Such receptor-selective APC mutants will be useful
reagents for deciphering which receptors play critical roles on cells in vitro or in animals in vivo, and they may
lead to translation for novel APC mutants. To address the major problem of COVID-19, Aim 2 studies will
characterize how murine COVID-19-like symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 infected hACE2 mice are influenced by
endogenous protein C systems, e.g., by anticoagulant systems, by cytoprotective systems including anti-
inflammation, anti-apoptosis, and endothelial barrier stabilization, and by fibrinolysis systems. Studies will define
how these systems are modulated to be either hyperactive or hypoactive. This will provide new insights into how
the protein C systems may be intertwined with defense versus SARS-CoV-2. The most promising cytoprotective-
selective APC mutant (3K3A-APC) will be tested for COVID-19 therapy to advance potential translation. Aim 3
will characterize the multifaceted roles of APC in the pathobiology of acute traumatic coagulopathy. Studies will
assess mechanisms by which disproportional APC generation contributes either to the development of acute
traumatic coagulopathy involving Factor V inactivation and hyperfibrinolysis or, conversely, to protection of the
integrity of organ function during and after acute traumatic coagulopathy by way of APC’s cytoprotective
activities. The proposed studies will provide novel mechanistic insights and new APC variants which may aid
translations to the clinic related to the APC pathways."

Annual mass azithromycin distribution dramatically reduces the prevalence of the ocular strains of Chlamydia
trachomatis that lead to blinding trachoma. Current World Health Organization guidelines indicate that annual
mass azithromycin distribution should be continued until district-level prevalence of the clinical sign of
trachoma, trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF), drops below 5%. However, TF does not correlate well
with infection after multiple rounds of azithromycin treatment. Specifically, any decrease in TF lags well behind
the decrease in infection. Thus the TF threshold may lead to overuse of antibiotics and depletion of scarce
resources. Here, we propose a community randomized controlled trial and diagnostic test study to evaluate
whether 1) azithromycin distribution can be discontinued in communities with TF prevalence up to 20%, and 2)
alternative indicators of trachoma transmission can better measure true infection. We anticipate that results will
provide evidence to support discontinuation of azithromycin treatment earlier, and evidence of that true local
elimination of infection can be achieved, altering the goal of the trachoma program from control to eradication."

 Expanded GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeats in the C9orf72 gene were recently identified as the most
common genetic cause of Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), two
neurodegenerative disorders with clinical, pathological and genetic overlaps. Proposed disease mechanisms
include loss of C9orf72 protein function and gain of toxicity from the bidirectionally transcribed sense or
antisense repeat-containing RNAs, mediated by sequestration of RNA binding proteins into RNA foci or by
production of at least five different aberrant dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins [GA, GP, GR, PR, and PA] from
the intronic sequence through a nonconventional translation mechanism called repeat-associated non-AUG-
dependent (RAN) translation. Several studies demonstrated that gain of toxicity from C9orf72 repeat containing
RNAs plays a central role in disease pathogenesis. It is yet unknown which specific cell types in the central
nervous system is responsible for the disease pathogenesis from gain of toxicity. C9orf72 loss of function
alone is insufficient to cause FTD/ALS in mice, but our preliminary data showed it exacerbates diseases
together with gain of toxicity. C9orf72 plays an important role in the immune cells as C9orf72 null mice develop
splenomegaly and enlarged cervical lymph nodes. However, the function of C9orf72 in microglia and its
contribution to FTD/ALS is not determined. In this proposal, will determine 1) molecular pathways altered by
C9orf72 loss of function in microglia using genome-wide RNA sequencing and whether such changes in
microglia will lead to neuronal toxicity (Aim 1); 2) Whether C9orf72 loss of function in microglia contributes to
FTD/ALS pathogenesis caused by gain of toxicity from the repeat containing RNAs in mice (Aim 2); and 3)
cell-type-specific toxicity from C9orf72 repeat containing RNAs (Aim 3). If successful, the proposed study will
further help us understand the disease mechanisms of C9orf72 repeat expansions in FTD and ALS and

Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene augmentation is currently the most effective approach for
treating recessive inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs). However, due to the limited capacity of AAV vectors,
gene augmentation currently is not possible for one third of IRD patients due to mutations in genes that are too
large for AAV, e.g., USH2A, which has a coding sequence of 15.6kb. Mutations in the USH2A gene are the
leading cause of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and Usher Syndrome Type II (USH2). These two diseases affect
approximately 500,000 people worldwide. Both diseases are characterized by progressive vision loss
beginning in early adulthood, with the addition of bilateral hearing loss from birth in USH2. Our long-term goal
is to develop therapeutics that slow or prevent vision and hearing loss in USH2A patients. Over 1000
pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants have been identified in the USH2A gene. To date, studies have
mainly focused on developing therapeutic strategies for the most prevalent mutation c.2299delG in exon 13 of
the USH2A gene, which accounts for approximately one third of all USH2A cases in Europe and the U.S.
c.2299delG disrupts the open reading frame of USH2A transcript. Multiple genetic approaches have been and
are being tested to repair this genetic defect, including antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-based exon skipping
therapy or CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. The exon skipping strategy have been extensively pursued in the past
several years. Multiple lines of pre-clinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that excision of exon 13 from
the USH2A gene can restore the disrupted open reading frame caused by c.2299delG mutation and lead to
rescue of the retinal phenotypes in animals and improved vision in human. These findings strongly support the
use of exon skipping as a treatment modality for some of the USH2A patients. The specific object of the
proposed research is to investigate the potentials of innovative technologies, including exon skipping, base
editing and prime editing, for the treatment of USH2A-related diseases. We plan to perform three proof-of-
concept studies in three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will identify which other exons in the USH2A gene can
serve as the next targets for exon skipping approach. To achieve this goal, we will generate mouse model that
lacks an exon of interest and evaluate the ability of the abbreviated forms of the USH2A protein is sufficient to
correct USH2A deficient phenotypes in mice. In Aim 2, we will explore the use of base editing to induce exon
skipping in cells and human retinal explants, with the hope to circumvent the constraints of ASO, or Cas9
nuclease mediated exon skipping approaches. In Aim 3, we will investigate the feasibility of implementing
prime editing to directly correct the mostly reported mutations in the USH2A gene, in particular the c.2299delG.
If successful, these studies will open new therapeutic avenues for USH2A-associated disorders. It will also
provide a template for similar efforts to develop therapies for other IRDs due to mutations in large genes."
10841569,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The internalization and recycling of receptors is a key biological process in all eukaryotic cells. The
early/sorting endosome is the initial destination of receptors internalized from the plasma membrane (PM). This
endosome serves as a major sorting station from which receptors are shunted to late endosomes and
lysosomes for degradation, or are recycled back to the PM through a transitory network of vesicular and
tubular recycling endosomes. Whereas a decade ago most researchers thought that active sorting directed
proteins to the degradation pathways, targeting to the recycling pathway was thought to be largely a passive
process that occurs by default. However, recent evidence supports active sorting to the recycling pathways by
specific sorting nexin (SNX) and other proteins that bind to the cytoplasmic tails of receptors and specifically
target them for recycling. Although recycling is an essential process for all mammalian cells, its complex
regulation is poorly understood including the sorting of receptors on endosomal membranes, the budding and
fission of vesicles and tubules from the endosome, and the transport of receptors back to the PM. As such, our
knowledge of endosomal function lags substantially behind that of receptor internalization mechanisms. A key
group of regulatory proteins that controls sorting and trafficking at the endosome is the retromer complex.
Originally identified in the retrieval of biosynthetic cargo from endosomes to the Golgi complex, the retromer
has recently been implicated in the regulation of a variety of key cellular pathways both within and beyond the
scope of endocytic trafficking including endocytic recycling, mitochondrial homeostasis, the centrosome cycle
and ciliogenesis. The retromer complex also interacts with other key endocytic regulatory proteins, including
the tubular endosome scaffold MICAL-L1; its interaction partner and endosomal fission modulator, EH domain
containing 1 (EHD1); and a host of SNX proteins that mediate endosomal cargo sorting. The retromer also
links to the actin cytoskeleton via the WASH complex. Our laboratory has been focusing on an overall
understanding of the mechanisms by which endocytic regulatory proteins function both in endocytic pathways
and in non-endocytic trafficking. Our primary expertise is in biochemistry and molecular cell biology coupled
with advanced light microscopy, but we recognize the need to incorporate in vivo components into our
approach and have ongoing collaborations with other groups to examine these processes in whole organisms,
including zebrafish and worms. In our studies, we will address significant and as-yet-unresolved biological
problems such as: 1) how endosomal fission is regulated and linked to sorting and recycling and 2) how key
endocytic proteins mediate the biogenesis of the primary cilium."
10841570,"Title: Roles of Macropinocytosis in HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T Cells
Project Summary:
Host cell entry is the first step in the replication cycle of HIV-1, the causative agent of AIDS. Although receptor
binding of viral Env glycoprotein and subsequent virus-cell fusion during the virus entry process have been
described in detail, subcellular locations of these events remain to be determined. In particular, despite the
importance of CD4+ T lymphocytes as a natural host cell type for HIV-1, the contribution of virion endocytosis
to HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T cells remains poorly understood. Previous studies of HIV-1 entry into T cells have
largely focused on clathrin-mediated endocytosis and cell surface fusion. However, our team recently
discovered that primary CD4+ T cells engage in robust macropinocytosis, a large-scale, clathrin-independent
form of endocytosis. Importantly, our preliminary data indicate that pharmacological inhibition of
macropinocytosis blocks both internalization of HIV-1 particles and productive infection in primary human
CD4+ T cells. In contrast, the same treatment does not affect HIV infection of a commonly used CD4+ T cell
line. These results suggest that the macropinocytic entry is a hitherto overlooked mode of HIV-1 entry that
contributes to infection of primary human CD4+ T cells. Interestingly, our preliminary study also showed that
inhibition of macropinocytosis after completion of virus internalization also blocks expression of virus-encoded
genes, suggesting that macropinocytosis has another later role in productive HIV infection, which is separable
from virus internalization. In the current application, we propose to determine the roles of macropinocytosis in
productive infection of primary CD4+ T cells. Our long-term goal is to fully describe cellular mechanisms that
promote HIV-1 infection and to use the obtained knowledge for developing antiviral strategies. Our central
hypothesis in this application is that macropinocytosis in primary human CD4+ T cells contributes to productive
infection as a major HIV-1 entry pathway and as a cellular function necessary for maintaining a permissive
environment for the virus. To test this hypothesis, we plan to determine: 1) the extent to which macropinocytic
internalization contributes to productive HIV entry into primary human CD4+ T cells; 2) the roles played by
Env-receptor interactions in promoting HIV-1 macropinocytosis; 3) the influence of macropinosome
environment on HIV-1 entry; and 4) the nature of post-internalization macropinocytosis function that promotes
productive infection. The outcomes of the experiments outlined in this proposal will likely fill the knowledge gap

10841573,"Food protein induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) is a non-IgE-mediated food allergy with a usual onset in
infancy. FPIES is recognized as an allergic emergency due to severe vomiting, and shock-like symptoms within
1-4 hours of ingestion of the causative food. Symptoms of FPIES resolve within hours following acute exposure
and days following chronic exposure; endoscopy and biopsy of gastrointestinal mucosa are not routinely
performed for the confirmation of diagnosis that is based on the recognition of the constellation of symptoms.
Diagnosis in infancy is based on clinical history, and oral food challenges (OFC) are performed to determine if
outgrowth has occurred. OFC are performed in hospital, with intravenous access in place for rapid fluid
resuscitation. In addition to being highly resource-intensive, they are limited in availability and extremely
unpleasant for the patient and the caregivers, due to the severity of the gastrointestinal symptoms. There is an
unmet need for better approaches for diagnosis, as well as an understanding of the underlying pathophysiology.
In Aim 1, we will randomize participants 1:2 to standard OFC or a novel low-dose multi-day challenge protocol,
in which individuals with a history of FPIES will be challenged on Day 1 with a low-dose (300 mg protein) OFC,
which we expect to be tolerated by most individuals with active FPIES. They will then continue with a daily 300
mg challenge at home for a total of 7 days, while monitoring symptoms. On day 8, participants will return for a
re-evaluation and biospecimen collection. If no objective symptoms were recorded during the at-home challenge,
a regular 3 g OFC will be performed. Objective symptoms at any point of the protocol will result in stopping of
the challenge. We anticipate that the majority of those who will react to the OFC will develop relatively mild but
objective gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea) during the at home dosing. In Aim 2, we will perform
high dimensional T cell profiling of T cells activated by the low dose chronic antigen challenge. FPIES is
associated with a lack of circulating detectable food-specific T cells, however during symptomatic reactions there
is a systemic innate immune cell activation as well as a Th17 cytokine signature detectable in the plasma,
suggesting a role for tissue resident T cells. As is observed with gluten challenge in celiac disease, we expect to
see an expansion of gut-resident T cells in the periphery in response to a multi-day food challenge. We will sort
these cells and perform spectral cytometry, bulk RNAseq, and single cell RNAseq to generate a full
understanding of the role of these cells in FPIES reactions. In Aim 3, we will examine the role of the purine
metabolism pathway as the mechanistic link between T cell activation and vomiting symptoms in FPIES.
Serotonin from enterochromaffin cells (EC) is thought to drive activation of vagal afferents leading to vomiting,
and EC are responsive to purine metabolites that are elevated during FPIES reactions. In Aim 3, we will use
gastrointestinal biopsies to study the immune regulation of serotonin release from ECs via the purine pathway.
Successful completion of our aims will directly improve patient care and advance our understanding of FPIES."
10841574,"Impact of Structural Racism and Discrimination on Liver Disease Disparities in High-Risk
 Asian American Populations
Project Summary
Structural racism and discrimination (SRD) play an important role in shaping persistent health disparities,
including liver disease disparities among racialized Asian Americans (AAs). Despite comprising 7% of U.S.
population, AAs account for more than half of all Hepatitis B (HBV) infections in the U.S. Of 2.4 million Americans
infected with HBV, 58% are AAs who have the highest HBV prevalence of any racial/ethnic group. Despite CDC
and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations to screen Asian adults who are at high risk for
infection, a significant majority of AAs (~68-75%) have never been screened, remaining undiagnosed. SRD
manifests in structural inequalities by limited access to care, culturally and linguistically appropriate
services/resources, social segregation, mistrust of health system, anti-Asian racism, immigration and poverty in
AAs. Most SRD research has examined how structural racism and multilevel determinants disadvantaged
healthcare access for Black/African Americans and Latinx, few have included AAs. Our preliminary studies
among Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese indicated that HBV screening and linkage to care disparities are
attributable to the intersection of multilevel structural barriers. During COVID-19 pandemic, barriers to care for
AAs are increasingly affected by anti-Asian racism, hate crimes and discrimination at each level, which impedes
HBV screening and care and exacerbates liver disease disparities. The overall goal of this innovative and timely
study is to identify structural racism and protective factors in relation to liver disease disparities and impact of
SRD on health outcomes by Asian Americans. Guided by an adapted multilevel Socio-Ecological Model, we will
leverage 20-year established Regional Cancer Health Disparities Networks to collaborate with community-based
organizations and clinical partners in greater Philadelphia and NYC. Specifically, our multidisciplinary team will
use mixed methods to: 1) examine the longitudinal association of individual-level SRD lived experiences (e.g.,
COVID-19 Anti-Asian racism, socio-historical trauma, cultural stereotype racism) and HBV screening and care
among 2000 Asian Americans: Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese; 2) examine the impact of institutional-level
SRD in healthcare settings (e.g., Anti-Asian racial bias, resources for patient navigators) on HBV screening
uptake and care; and 3) elucidate the impact of community-level SRD (e.g., Anti-Asian racism/xenophobia and
residential segregation) and protective factors (e.g. residence, social norms/advocacy and neighborhood social
cohesion) on impeding or promoting screening and care. Finally, we conduct integrative analysis to examine
whether individual, institutional and community-level SRD are associated with HBV screening uptake and linkage
to care. This is the first multilevel, longitudinal study that will enable us to understand how structural racism drives
HBV-related liver disease disparities among high-risk Asian Americans. Our study findings will identify culturally
attuned strategies to mitigate SRD and design interventions to improve overall quality of chronic HBV care. Our
study will likely result in a paradigm shift from individual level approach to eliminate Hepatitis B by 2030."

The lysosome is an important organelle responsible for digesting and recycling materials, nutrient sensing, and
controlling cell proliferation. It is also linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's,
Huntington's, and Parkinson's diseases. Despite its importance, the regulation of lysosomal membrane protein
composition and the function of its transporters and ion channels are not well understood. My lab has made
significant progress in studying the turnover mechanisms of lysosomal membrane proteins by identifying a
conserved ubiquitin- and ESCRT-dependent pathway for protein degradation. However, several key questions
remain, including the identification of substrates of lysosomal E3 ligases in humans (future direction 1), the
assembly of the ESCRT machinery to the lysosome membrane for internalizing ubiquitinated cargoes (future
direction 2), and identifying other proteins involved in the quality control process. Additionally, there is a lack
of understanding of the substrates, direction of transport, and energy dependence of many lysosomal
transporters and ion channels (future direction 3). My lab has developed a reconstitution platform to study
lysosomal membrane transport proteins, which will be combined with conventional methods such as
metabolomics of isolated lysosomes to better understand these processes."
10843149,"Project Summary
The landmark Institute of Medicine report, “Emerging Infections: Microbial Threats to Health in the United
States"" highlighted the importance of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and improved control for
zoonotic infectious diseases in natural animal hosts—60% of all human pathogens are directly transmitted
from or emergent from animal reservoirs. Understanding the behavior of zoonotic pathogens, including
mechanisms of persistence, evolution of virulence, and genetic change underlying transmission
phenotypes, is now widely recognized as critically important to addressing emerging infections. In
addition, the importance of zoonotic pathogens and normal microbial flora of animals in emergence,
formation of reservoirs, and spread of antimicrobial resistance has been highlighted in recent reports by
both CDC and WHO.
This Post-doctoral Training Program specifically prepares a scientific workforce prepared to and capable
of addressing critical knowledge gaps in infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance. The Training
Program focuses on the integrated training of two types of post-doctoral fellows: (i) clinically-trained
veterinarians with either residency training or a MPH (3-5 years post-DVM); and (ii) recent PhD graduates
with research experience in cell biology, genetics, epidemiology, immunology, or microbiology (0-2 years
post-PhD). Training for those who enter the program with DVM degrees is guided by two principles: (i) a
strong basic sciences foundation is indispensable and is attained with targeted coursework; and ii) a
minimum of 3 years of dedicated research is required to build the basis for career progression to
independence. Training for post-doctoral fellows with PhD degrees is tailored to their backgrounds but
emphasizes research directed at critical knowledge gaps in zoonotic infectious diseases and/or
antimicrobial resistance. In addition to education on the responsible conduct of research, all trainees
receive instruction on experimental design and data interpretation that generates rigorous and
reproducible results. As the Training Program recruits primarily entry-level post-doctoral fellows, 3 years
of fellowship commitment is required. This integration provides a dynamic training environment where
post-DVM fellows develop the basic research skills required to address and solve complex diseases while
post-PhD fellows develop specific expertise with microbial pathogens and a broader and deeper
understanding of the global health relevance and impact. Program data strongly supports that the Training
Program is addressing a significant gap with strong demand and preparing both types of entry level fellows
for successful careers."
10843156,"Project Summary/Abstract
A common feature of human aging is an increased susceptibility to infections. This age-related susceptibility is
linked with a significant and reproducible loss of naïve T cells in older individuals. Notably, aged naïve cells not
only reduce in number but also display features of partial differentiation, implying a loss in cellular quiescence
may cause repertoire contraction and dysfunction with age. Naïve T cell quiescence is classically maintained
within secondary lymphoid tissues (SLTs) by fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs). Mouse models have elegantly
demonstrated the ability of FRCs to promote T cell survival and directly inhibit activation-induced
differentiation. These data suggest that FRCs actively regulate naïve T cell quiescence and likely play an
essential role in its loss during aging. However, mechanistic studies in humans are significantly confounded by
rare use of single cell technologies and limited by poor naïve T cell survival in standard in vitro culture and
humanized mice. Better utilization of new single cell techniques and the development of novel methodologies
that sustain naïve T cells in vitro is thus required to gain further insight into naïve T cell maintenance during
human aging. Our preliminary data suggests high heterogeneity of human naïve T cells that narrows with age,
a situation that can be mimicked in vitro through the use of a novel SLT-like organoid model system. For this
proposal, Aim 1 will define the overall phenotypic, transcriptional and epigenetic heterogeneity of the naïve T
cell compartment during human aging. In addition, Aim 2 will further develop SLT-like organoids for the long-
term study of naïve T cell quiescence. Aim 3 will use our organoid system, in combination with ex vivo and in
vitro assays, to determine the role of FRCs in the maintenance of naïve T cell quiescence and its breakdown
with aging. The overarching goals of these studies are to define fundamental naïve T cell heterogeneity and
determine causes of age-related homeostatic decline – to ultimately identify potential therapeutic interventions
to boost protective immunity and prevent pathogenic infections in older individuals. The applicant Dr. Claire
Gustafson has outlined an integrative five-year research and career development plan to advance her
knowledge in single cell techniques and their analysis pipelines and to develop a novel, organoid-based
research platform to study T cell homeostasis during aging. Dr. Gustafson’s mentor, Dr. Jörg Goronzy, has
comprehensive expertise in T cell aging as well as an extensive network of scientific collaborators using high
throughput analytical techniques. This mentorship combined with Dr. Gustafson’s team of expert advisors and
the resources available at Stanford University provides an exceptional research environment for Dr. Gustafson
to successfully become a strong independent investigator in the area of human immune aging."
10842060,"Project Summary/Abstract
Catalytic difunctionalization of alkenes with two carbon sources is a powerful method to create two carbon-
carbon bonds in one synthetic step. Achievement of this objective will establish new techniques for the rapid,
concise and cost-effective construction of the cores of many biologically important molecules. Our long-term goal
is to devise and create such catalytic reactions that will allow us to add one or both alkyl sources to unactivated
alkenes. However, these are exceptionally challenging reactions to develop largely because of two critical
problems – a) low reactivity of unactivated alkenes, and b) difficulty in intercepting catalytic intermediates
generated upon the addition of the first carbon source. To remedy these challenges, strongly metal-binding
groups, such as imines, pyridines and aminoquinolines, are currently employed, which can both activate alkenes
by proximity effects and promote migratory insertion, and stabilize alkylmetal intermediates as metallacycles,
thereby decelerating -H elimination and enabling subsequent interception. However, serious limitations exist
with this approach, particularly with the requirement for the installation and removal of coordinating groups.
These reactions are also mainly successful for incorporating two C(sp2) coupling reagents, such aryls and
alkenyls. In addition, the coordination-assisted strategy is not applicable for alkenes that don’t have heteroatoms
proximal to the alkenes. To remedy these limitations, we are adopting two substrate-dependent strategies. We
will develop transition metal catalysis for alkenyl substrates containing simple FGs, a universal scenario in
organic synthesis. A key challenge in implementing simple FGs for coordination is their weak binding to metals
and the low stability of their metallacycles since they are fluxional. We will develop a combination of electron
deficient alkenes (EDAs) and organic nitriles (RCN) as a dual ligand system for transition metals to promote
simple FG-assisted alkene difunctionalization in non-coordinating reaction media through the stabilization of
reaction intermediates and promotion of C(sp3)/C(sp3) reductive elimination. For alkenes where no FGs are
present for coordination, we will develop photoredox catalysis. Photoredox catalysis enables the generation of
carbon-centered radicals, which are most amenable intermediates to react with alkenes. A key challenge to
apply this strategy for alkene difunctionalization is the interception of the resultant second carbon-centered
radicals with organo-reagents. We are developing a novel photoredox catalytic process with photoexcited
dioxygen and catalytic iodine. We propose to implement this catalytic protocol for alkene difunctionalization
reactions, including generating strained ring systems such as cyclopropanes. Our ultimate goal is to transform
catalytic alkene difunctionalization with two carbonaceous reagents into its enantioselective version. We will
design and develop TADOL-phosphoramidites, PyOx and BOX ligand systems to realize this goal. The catalytic
alkene difunctionalization reactions and their enantioselective variants proposed, for which we have strong
preliminary results, are unique transformations that cannot be achieved with using other methodology."

Circadian clocks are cell-autonomous timekeepers that generate ~24-hour oscillations in gene
expression and control rhythms in almost all aspects of our behavior and physiology, including sleep-
wake cycles, metabolism, and immunity. Almost every cell in the human body has a clock and
dysregulation of clocks have been implicated in many human pathologies such as diabetes, cancer, and
neurodegenerative diseases. Although past studies, primarily using genetic screens and biochemical
assays, have outlined the genetic basis of circadian rhythms, very little is known about how circadian
clocks are organized and regulated at the subcellular level in an intact organism. Using Drosophila clock
neurons as a model system, my lab has recently made the surprising discovery that clock neurons
possess a complex internal organization where clock proteins, genes, and mRNAs are strategically
localized to specific subcellular compartments so that cellular events can occur at the right time and the
right place. Specifically, we have discovered that clock proteins and genes are organized into nuclear
condensates at the nuclear periphery during the circadian repression phase to enable transcriptional co-
repression. More recently, our studies revealed that clock mRNAs and proteins are localized to the
perinuclear cytoplasmic region, which is vital for the post-transcriptional regulation of clock mRNAs and
for generating ~24-h circadian rhythms. My laboratory will build upon these discoveries to achieve a
mechanistic understanding of the spatiotemporal mechanisms that govern circadian rhythms by
developing novel tools as well as harnessing the power of high-resolution live imaging, genetics,
proteomics, functional genomics, and behavior assays. First, we will utilize a novel proximity labeling
approach that we developed for identifying interaction partners of Period, a core clock protein, over the
circadian cycle to gain a deeper understanding of circadian regulation at the molecular level. Second, we
will investigate circadian genome organization in clock neuron nuclei using both imaging and sequencing-
based methods and determine the underlying molecular mechanisms to understand the role of nuclear
architecture on circadian rhythms. Third, we will determine the mechanisms that govern the
spatiotemporal localization of cytosolic clock mRNAs and proteins to understand the organizing principles
of cytoplasmic clock complexes. These studies have the potential to not only transform our understanding
of how cells keep time at the molecular level in intact organisms, but will also provide new insights into
important, overarching biological questions relevant to gene regulation in many contexts, including
learning and memory, development, and disease. Using insights from this research our long-term goal is
to engineer novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of diseases associated with dysregulated
clocks."
10842069,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Biology and Biochemistry of the Microtubule Cytoskeleton
Microtubules are cytoskeletal polymers that are vital for a wide range of cellular functions. They serve as tracks
for microtubule-based motor proteins (i.e., kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein), and perform work when their ends
attach to subcellular structures such as kinetochores. Most microtubule-based processes rely on assembly of
microtubules into higher order structures such as the mitotic spindle. This in turn depends on cellular factors
such as microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and microtubule motors, which bind microtubules and organize
them in three-dimensional space. How MAPs and motors drive assembly of microtubule-based arrays is not fully
understood, particularly under conditions of stress. In addition, the complexity of the microtubule system is
augmented by post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are “written” onto microtubules; PTMs alter the affinity
of MAPs and motors for the microtubule lattice, providing a mechanism to create functionally distinct subsets of
microtubules. Our research is focused on understanding how MAPs and motor proteins engage the MT
cytoskeleton to orchestrate essential cellular processes. To address this and fill gaps in our knowledge we: (i)
Discovered a second pathway that drives assembly of the mitotic spindle, and developed inhibitors against a
motor protein that plays a key role in this pathway; (ii) Developed a screening pipeline to identify proteins that
bind to microtubules in a manner that depends on tubulin PTMs; and (iii) Identified a mechanism that may explain
how tubulin PTMs are written onto the microtubule lattice. The research proposal benefits from our expertise and
will combine in vitro reconstitution and cell biology approaches to address long-standing questions: (a) How do
MAPs and motor proteins work together to build the mitotic spindle?; (b) What are the functional outputs of tubulin
PTMs?; and (c) How are MTs selected for post-translational modification? Our research will provide new insights
into fundamental mechanisms that regulate the biological and biochemical properties and functions of the
microtubule cytoskeleton and uncover general principles that inform on other cellular processes (e.g.,
microtubule organization in neurons)."

Opioid use disorder and overdose deaths represent a national public health crisis that has been particularly
acute in central Appalachia for decades. While treatment access and engagement are improving across
Appalachia, the quality of the recovery support ecosystem is reflected in the small percentage of individuals
who successfully maintain treatment with medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) or abstain in recovery.
An interface of community and treatment, peer recovery support services (PRSS) are a particularly high value
proposition to enhance treatment outcomes and the recovery process, though one for which there is currently
limited evidence to inform the content of their practice and use, particularly in the context of MOUD. While
research to advance recovery support services is urgently needed in central Appalachia, insufficiencies in
basic infrastructure, such as research capacity, engaged clinical research sites, and data infrastructure remain
barriers to PRSS implementation and study. In response, the Studies To Advance Recovery Support (STARS)
Network, a thematic, stakeholder-focused research network, will be initiated from an established regional
research consortium—the Opioids Research Consortium of Central Appalachia (ORCCA). The following
network aims will be executed by leveraging assets inherent to ORCCA and concentrating on PRSS for
individuals treated in the context MOUD clinics: 1) build university and health system partner capacity to
conduct community-engaged PRSS research; 2) enroll cohorts of MOUD clinics and PRSS professionals to
foster commitment to engage in rapid conduct of PRSS studies; 3) advance processes and technologies to
harmonize data and research efficiencies that advance PRSS studies across institutional partners; and 4)
advance STARS network capacity to conduct rapid-cycle intervention research using rigorous designs. A
dynamic team, jointly led by established ETSU and Virginia Tech researchers and facilitated by ORCCA
institutions and PRSS partners with lived experience in recovery, offer assurance of successful execution. The
proposed work is innovative because it aligns assets of an established opioids research consortium for
maximum efficiency, demonstrates a novel application of the Recovery Ready Ecosystem Model, and creates
rigorously developed assessment tools and critical cohort platforms of PRSS professionals and MOUD clinics
for the purpose of recovery research. The proposed work is significant because the expected outcomes and
products will mitigate current barriers to, and establish a foundation for, high-priority PRSS research in the
central Appalachian region (KY, TN, VA, WV), a region devastated by the opioid crisis. Consistent with the
NIDA mission, our long-term goal for this work is to inform the expansion of recovery support services,
particularly PRSS, and advance recovery among individuals treated with MOUD."

Obesity disproportionately impacts sexual minority women. The goal of this K23 is to improve obesity
treatments for sexual minority women by tailoring and optimizing an evidence-based online behavioral weight
loss program to enhance weight loss in this group. This objective aligns with the research priorities outlined in
NIH’s Notice of Special Interest in Research on the Health of Sexual and Gender Minorities (NOT-MD-19-001).
Behavioral weight loss programs are the gold standard treatment for mild to moderate obesity. Rx Weight Loss
is an online behavioral weight loss program (co-developed by mentors on this K23) that is effective, low-cost,
and highly scalable. However, existing research and the Candidate’s pilot work suggest that tailoring treatment
to address 3 well-established weight loss barriers in sexual minority women will be critical for maximizing the
relevance and efficacy of behavioral weight loss for this group. This K23 will tailor Rx Weight Loss to address
sexual minority women’s weight loss barriers (i.e., minority stress, low social support, negative body image)
and conduct an optimization trial to identify whether and how tailored components enhance weight loss
outcomes in sexual minority women using the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST). The Preparation
Phase (Aim 1) will involve developing 3 novel treatment components targeting sexual minority women’s weight
loss barriers and refining the intervention based on pilot testing and feedback from qualitative interviews with
20 sexual minority women. The Optimization Phase (Aim 2) will involve conducting a factorial experiment. 88
sexual minority women will receive 12 weeks of Rx Weight Loss and randomization to receive 0-3 tailored
components. This data will be used to determine whether novel components - alone and in combination -
impact mean weight loss and the proportion of women achieving clinically significant weight loss at 6 months
(Aim 2A) and to clarify how tailored components affect weight loss by testing hypothesized mechanisms of
action (Aim 2B). Novel components that increase mean weight loss by ≥2% or the proportion achieving 5+%
weight loss by ≥10% will be retained in a final obesity treatment package to evaluate in a future RCT.
This project builds on the Candidate’s prior work in sexual minority women and will be completed with
guidance from a highly qualified and experienced mentorship team. The Candidate’s overarching goal in
this K23 is to establish skills in applying cultural tailoring and innovative methods (e.g., technology-
based treatment, MOST) to improve the relevance, efficacy, and impact of behavioral weight loss
programs for sexual minority women. The mentorship, training, and experience provided by the K23 will
allow the Candidate to acquire these skills and to launch an independent research career leveraging these
skills to address obesity disparities in sexual minority women and other underserved groups."

Substance use disorders (SUD) are common, chronic, and associated with substantial death and despair but
can be treated. American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations are vulnerable to health and healthcare
disparities and increased likelihood of SUD due to colonialism, historical trauma, and structural racism.
Understanding substance use and its treatment among AI/AN Veterans would fill a major knowledge
gap and provide needed foundation for development and testing of a culturally appropriate SUD
intervention that can be built on strength and resilient factors among AI/AN Veterans and delivered in
clinical settings. Guided by Public Health Critical Race (PHCR) praxis, the mixed-methods parent R01
provides a unique and synergistic opportunity to conduct needed foundational clinical epidemiology and in-
depth qualitative work to inform development of an intervention that can be tested in a Type I Hybrid design.
The proposed supplement capitalizes on this rich foundation and substantial upfront investment from NIDA to
add an unprecedented and community-engaged line of inquiry into substance use and its treatment among
AI/AN Veterans and support culturally appropriate intervention development. The overall goal of the proposed
supplement is to build on the resources developed through the parent study to conduct research in partnership
with AI/AN community members and guided by PHCR to provide the foundation for developing a Hybrid Type I
study of a culturally appropriate, strengths-based intervention. The specific aims, all of which will be guided by
community partners, include: Aim 1) Describe the prevalence of unique substance use disorders among AI/AN
Veterans, overall and relative to White Veterans, and identify multilevel factors associated with SUD among
AI/AN Veterans; Aim 2) Describe receipt of and multilevel factors influencing evidence-based treatment (e.g.,
specialty addictions treatment and/or receipt of effective pharmacotherapies) among AI/AN Veterans with
SUD, and compare likelihood of receipt to those of White Veterans with SUD; Aim 3) Understand experiences
of SUD, their treatment, and multi-level lived experiences that influence these among AI/AN Veterans through
in-depth qualitative interviews with ~40 AI/AN Veterans. The proposed community-partnered innovative
foundational study will be the first to our knowledge to describe the prevalence of SUD and its treatment, as
well as multi-level factors that result from structural racism to influence these experiences, among AI/AN
Veterans. It is also the only study to our knowledge to obtain in-depth qualitative information to understand the
lived experiences of AI/AN Veterans with SUD and how they influence SUD treatment and the multi-level
factors that influence both. Together the planned activities will provide foundational data and community
engagement we need to design a community-engaged, culturally appropriate intervention to decrease SUD
and increase SUD treatment among AI/AN Veterans whose lived experiences are heavily influenced by
uniquely American structural racism."

Marine Natural Products continue to play a critical role in the treatment and prevention of human diseases. Most
of our small molecule drugs are either derived from or inspired by natural products. While the majority of them
is based on terrestrial natural products, the marine environment remains a largely unexplored frontier that
harbors the greatest biodiversity on our planet. This rich biodiversity in turn translates into chemical diversity and
potentially new pharmacology as a basis for the discovery of new strategies for the management of human
health. The unique chemical scaffolds of marine natural products that consequently displays unique
pharmacology, provides structure-function pairs for target validation and drug development. In recent decades
marine natural products researchers have searched for ways to effectively harness new methodologies to mine
the biosynthetic potential of marine organisms. With advances in sampling strategies, genomics, synthetic and
chemical biology, complimented by new analytical and synthetic chemistry tools, this field has been addressing
the challenges and gaining major insight into structural novelty, supply issue and target identification, thus
overcoming the hurdles in the current era. The field has been emphasizing the development of databases and
computational tools, including machine learning, to analyze the massive genomic and structural information.
Breakthroughs in fields such as cryo-EM, and other enabling technologies as antibody-drug conjugation have
now penetrated the field of marine natural products, synergizing with other methods to decipher target
interactions. As we anticipate this huge progress to lead to a new wave of drugs to help combat the rapidly
evolving trends in human diseases, the synergistic efforts in multiple disciplines related to marine natural
products science will be the focus of the 2024 Marine Natural Products GRC that consequently aligns well with
the mission of NCCIH. Subtitled “From Discovery to Production via Function to Applications”, the meeting will
provide an exceptional platform to all marine natural products researchers at various career stages and coming
from all parts of the globe while representing research in both academia and industry, to gather, exchange,
network and be inspired by the peers in the field. Presentations and discussions will address themes from various
perspectives, including technologies, disease indications, biological targets and applications at the molecular,
cellular and organismal levels as well as ecological context. Attendees bring diverse and cross-disciplinary
expertise in bioorganic, medicinal, and pharmaceutical chemistry, and ecology, as well as in genomics,
biotechnology, bioinformatics and molecular pharmacology. Ample opportunities for scientific exchange in and
outside of meeting sessions, collaboration, and networking will facilitate the pivotal goal of connecting and
educating marine natural products researchers. NIH support will be directed to fund the participation of graduate
students and postdoctoral attendees as presenters and discussion leaders at the 2024 GRS, and early career
as well as established scientists, while emphasizing the participation of females and members of groups that are
traditionally under-represented in science."

This collaboration develops a comprehensive mathematical model of phosphorylation-dependent cardiac myosin
binding protein C (cMyBP-C) regulation. The resulting model will be leveraged to predict how to best manipulate
cMyBP-C phosphorylation to prevent or reverse contractile dysfunction in heart failure with reduced, or preserved
ejection fraction.
Recent attempts to treat cardiac disease by modifying myofilament-level function have been mostly
disappointing. The main problem is that it has been difficult to enhance contraction without compromising
relaxation, and vice versa. In vivo, of course, autonomic control can enhance both contraction and relaxation at
the same time. During exercise, for example, the heart contracts more forcefully and it also relaxes faster to
allow time for the ventricles to fill as heart rate increases. While numerous mechanisms contribute to this
behavior, cMyBP-C is one of the main sarcomere-level effectors. It’s therefore possible that cMyBP-C could be
strategically manipulated to create innovative new treatments for cardiac disease.
The main barrier to developing these treatments is that cMyBP-C’s function is complex and regulated by at least
9 phosphorylation residues. The functional roles of the individual residues are not equivalent and the large
number of potential combinations means that approaches based solely on cell and animal-based experiments
are impractical. This challenge will be overcome by developing computational models that can capture and
predict cMyBP-C’s complex impact on contractile function at both the sarcomere and whole organ levels.
The multidisciplinary team comprises three experienced investigators with complementary skills: Julian Stelzer,
PhD, Kenneth Campbell, PhD, and Brett Colson, PhD. The proposal has 3 Aims:
Aim 1 combines high-throughput screens and computer modeling to predict cMyBP-C phospho-variants that
enhance contraction and relaxation. Aim 2 tests these predictions in mice using AAV9 gene delivery. Aim 3
determines whether phospho-variants of cMyBP-C can rescue contractile function in mice and in samples of
myocardium isolated from patients with disease.
The proposal is innovative and advances understanding of cMyBP-C biology and clinical translation. The team’s
commitment to sharing open-source code and experimental data will benefit research focused on heart failure."

has a unique combination of geographic (e.g., locale relative to legacy and emerging pollution sources),
historic (e.g., land use, age and condition of housing stock), and demographic (e.g., socioeconomics, race,
ethnicity, age) characteristics that together create the spectrum of environmental risk and environmental justice
issues that produce disparities in the incidence and severity of adverse health outcomes including preterm
birth, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. A community-engaged, transdisciplinary team science
approach is essential to address the major environmental health challenges facing Detroit’s racially and
ethnically diverse population. We have assembled a talented interdisciplinary team of established and
emerging environmental health scientists who work with our community partners to accomplish this work. We
listen to our community partners, and their concerns inform the Center and provide direction for building our
research capacity so that our research translates back to the community. CURES advances the NIEHS 2018-
2023 Strategic Plan by performing research that increases environmental health science knowledge, converts
“data to knowledge to action,” and supports the growth of workforce diversity, team-building, and collaboration.
To create a gateway to a healthy urban environment starting with Detroit, CURES’ short-term goals are to 1)
strengthen CURES existing partnerships and develop new ones within the Detroit community, and in
collaboration with our community partners identify environmental threats common to US urban populations and
provide scientifically-based strategies to mitigate them; 2) conduct integrated mechanistic, epidemiological,
and community-engaged research that addresses the consequences of urban chemical and non-chemical
exposures on human health; 3) build CURES’ investigator capabilities by providing facility cores that provide
state-of-the-art analytical services as well as pilot funds to explore the feasibility of new areas of study; 4)
secure the long term contribution of CURES on the discipline of EHS by mentoring new and established
investigators to attain their professional goals and prepare them for EHS leadership; and 5) foster a culture of
antiracism, inclusion, and environmental health equity throughout the Center. Our long-term goal is for CURES
to be a premier Environmental Health Sciences Core Center that is focused on urban environmental health,
environmental justice, and resilience in the face of chemical and non-chemical stressors. CURES is optimally
positioned to pursue innovative, community-engaged, team science research opportunities that have the
greatest promise to deliver transformative gains in the early detection, prevention, and eventual eradication of
urban environmental disease in our lifetime."

resources that each contribute unique capabilities to identifying and quantifying
toxicants and biological responses to toxicant exposure. High performance technologies
including small molecule quantitative analysis, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and
proteomic analyses are most frequently requested by CURES Center investigators and
form the base for ESFC services. With Center investigators increasingly focused on
questions regarding the interaction of environmental exposure and the physiological
response to chemical and non-chemical stressors we have included analytical
resources to quantify protein and DNA adducts, small molecule toxicants and
metabolites, cellular profiling as well as cytokines, lipids and metabolites. Our combined
facilities include some of the most advanced analytical capabilities available for targeted
and untargeted analysis of the exposome and for discovery of exposure signatures.
Although we focus on the common matrices of blood, plasma, urine, cells and tissues,
we can work with any biological or environmental sample matrix. Because few
investigators are familiar with the full scope and power of the technologies available
through the ESFC we consult with investigators as they are planning a project. We offer
advice regarding analytical end points, how those end points could be achieved
experimentally and the cost involved in doing that work. To offset costs at the initial
stages of a study 28 vouchers of $2500 are available each year. Vouchers can be used
in any of the six ESFC labs. Investigators are rarely familiar with the latest advances in
technology or which is most appropriate for the study. Omics technologies produce data
sets that require specialized software available in the laboratory where the data are
generated. Using our experience with bioinformatics for interpretation of the data is the
final step offered by the ESFC. The complete ESFC package provides investigators with

ABSTRACT
The Center for Urban Responses to Environmental Stressors (CURES) aims to improve the lives of citizens of
Detroit through community-responsive research that deflects the adverse health effects of combined exposures
to chemical and non-chemical stressors in a complex urban environment. To address the mission and
objectives of CURES, the Community Engagement Core (CEC) has established several innovative and
community responsive practices. The CEC team is a diverse group and includes two leaders of the CURES
Community Advisory Board (CAB) who are integrated into all CEC activities and meetings and more broadly
across CURES as well. The CEC will convene a large, 23 member, highly engaged CAB at meetings three
times per year that will be co-facilitated with the CAB Co-Chairs. The CEC and CAB will co-develop events that
will allow us to directly reach hundreds of Detroit residents each year through a grassroots outreach strategy
that provides information and resources on timely and locally relevant environmental health topics. The CEC
will also develop innovative training programs, including tailored skill building to enhance science
communication skills with public audiences and advocacy training sessions to provide community stakeholders
with knowledge on how to connect with key decision makers. During the next four years, the interface between
racial justice and environmental justice will be the overarching aim and foundation of the CURES CEC’s
activities, and the CEC’s core objective will be to foster community resilience through the integration of
community members and their needs with CURES priorities and activities. To address the CURES CEC’s
overarching aim and core objective, the CEC will pursue four Specific Aims: (1) The CEC, through shared
leadership with CAB Co-Chairs, will focus on amplifying and integrating CAB and community stakeholders’
environmental health and anti-racism priorities across the CURES Cores and activities. (2) The CEC will
increase community stakeholders’ and researchers’ capacity for multi-directional engagement about
environmental health science by co-developing and implementing a tailored skills training curriculum for
community stakeholders and researchers to provide best practices for collaboration, communication, and
engagement with diverse populations. (3) The CEC will deliver educational forums (“Environmental Health
Chats”) and spin-off sessions, that will focus on the main research themes of CURES investigators and current
community priorities, using strategies that take into account the social determinants of health that impede
Detroit residents’ access to health bolstering information, e.g., digital exclusion, limited transportation, etc.
(4) Finally, the CEC will deliver innovative advocacy training that melds hazardous site tours with hands-on
advocacy education that will embolden community stakeholders to become effective advocates in the policy
influencing process."

Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a debilitating disorder characterized by spontaneous and recurring seizures as
well as pervasive memory and psychiatric impairments. These TLE-induced comorbidities do not respond to
pharmacological treatment, and little is known about how specific brain circuits are altered by disease to drive
these clinical phenotypes. Recent evidence suggests that these comorbidities are driven by deficits along the
dorsoventral axis of the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit and that they are dissociable from seizures themselves.
As such, it is imperative to study how epilepsy may detrimentally alter temporal lobe circuitry that is a key node
in memory and emotion processing. In previous work, our lab and others have established CA1 of dorsal
hippocampus (dCA1) as a site of poor spatial processing in epileptic mice. However, it remains unclear if
upstream inputs to dCA1 are impaired which may be driving downstream changes in hippocampus. In the F99
phase, I will test the hypothesis that medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) has disrupted spatial coding in epileptic
mice and will specifically test how distinct hippocampal inputs from layer 3 (MECIII) pyramidal neurons and
layer 2 (MECII) stellate cells are altered. I will perform in vivo calcium imaging in these isolated subpopulations
as epileptic and control mice perform spatial foraging and memory tasks, both before and after the onset of
progressive memory impairments. This will allow me to determine the relationship between these spatial
coding metrics and progressive memory deficits found in epileptic mice. During this phase I will receive
technical training on in vivo calcium imaging and large-scale data analysis, as well as conceptual training on
epilepsy models, learning and memory circuits, spatial coding, and integrating neural recordings with behavior.
In the K00 phase, I plan to combine my previous expertise in stress-induced changes in entorhinal-
hippocampal signaling with my current work in epilepsy circuits to determine how the ventral extent of this
circuit contributes to altered emotional regulation in epilepsy. I will combine state-of-the-art mouse behavior,
molecular assays, gene expression studies, calcium imaging, and virally mediated manipulation techniques to
characterize ventral entorhinal-hippocampal circuit changes that drive psychiatric symptoms in epilepsy.
Results from these studies will provide new insights into the neural and circuit mechanisms of epilepsy induced
emotion deficits. Together, this training across F99 and K00 phases will support my successful transition to
postdoctoral researcher and ultimately a career as an independent research scientist focusing on molecular,
cellular, behavioral, and circuit-level signatures of behavioral dysfunction associated with epilepsy and stress."

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with a 5-year survival rate of 15%. Only
a small proportion (16%) of lung cancer cases are diagnosed at an early stage, when it is more likely to be
curable, thus we need improved strategies to identify high-risk individuals for intensive surveillance. Although
cigarette smoking and other environmental factors are risks for lung cancer, it is estimated that 10-25% of lung
cancers occur in never-smokers, highlighting the potential role of inherited genetic factors in lung cancer.
Familial lung cancer as well as genome wide association studies have identified few lung cancer predisposing
genes, which only explains 14% of all inherited risk for lung cancer. Hence, most of the genetic risk for lung
cancer remains unexplained. With the adven t of the next-generation sequencing technologies, emerging
evidence suggests the contribution of pathogenic germline mutations in DNA damage repair (DDR) genes in
lung cancer susceptibility and etiology. Our preliminary data shows that about 6.8% of lung can cer patients
harbored pathogenic mutations in DDR genes including high and moderate penetrant mutations in ATM,
BRCA2, CHEK2, ERCC2, NBN and TP53. We hypothesize that the genetic alternations in DDR genes may
modify the intrinsic and extrinsic (tobacco smoking or environmental) risk factors of lung cancer. The objectives
of our proposed study are to determine the clinical significance of inherited mutations in DDR genes in lung
cancer, study the interplay between germline-somatic mutational architecture and functionally characterize
them to understand the mechanism of lung cancer susceptibility. Our findings will inform clinical and preventive
management by elucidating genotype-phenotype correlations, penetrance (risk) modification, and clinical
outcomes in genetically defined cohorts. For the proposed study, we will leverage the ongoing MSK-IMPACT
initiative, an institution-wide effort to perform genomic testing using paired tumor–normal tissue samples
in 10,000 patients with lung cancers as well as whole exome sequencing for a selected 400 lung cancer
patients who had either family history of any cancer, or early diagnosis (age at diagnosis <50 years)
or personal history of multiple primary tumors. In aim 1, we will discover germline mutations in DDR
genes using novel analytical framework by integrating germline-somatic data for variant interpretation. We
will replicate our findings in a case-control cohort in collaboration with the International Lung Cancer
Consortium and England Genomics UK and determine risk associated with lung cancer in a case-control
cohort and the pattern of inheritance in families (Aim 2). We will establish the clinical and functional
significance of the germline mutations using the CRISPR gene editing approach and generate patient-
derived xenograph (PDX) models from patients carrying germline mutations in DDR genes to test the
therapeutic options; this will open the new paradigm of research and treatment options for lung cancer
guidelines for lung cancer patients and their family members (cascade testing) for early detection."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal brain tumor with a median survival rate of about 15 months
despite intensive multimodal treatment including immunotherapy. GBM is highly immunosuppressive and
resistant to immunotherapy because glioma cells escape from effective antitumor immunity by modifying the
tumor microenvironment (TME). Owing to the diversity and plasticity of tumor cells and the surrounding TME,
understanding the mechanisms of immune evasion by GBM remains elusive. Our long-term goal is to dissect
cancer-cell-intrinsic mechanisms that reprogram the TME of GBM for the development of effective treatments.
We recently identified Chitinase-3-like-1 (CHI3L1), a highly expressed and secreted glycoprotein in GBM as a
candidate to mediate immune evasion. Our central finding is that silencing Chi3l1 expression in syngeneic GBM
mouse models results in increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), tumor size reduction, and improved
animal survival, which is reversed by overexpression of CHI3L1. The underlying mechanism we discovered is
that Galectin-3 (Gal3), a member of the β-galactoside-binding lectin family, and Galectin-3 binding protein
(Gal3BP), a secreted glycoprotein, interact competitively with the same binding motif on CHI3L1, leading to
selective accumulation of protumor M2-like versus antitumor M1-like bone marrow-derived macrophages
(BMDMs) and resident microglia (MG). The overall objective in this application is to determine the detailed
molecular mechanisms whereby CHI3L1 resets tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) including BMDMs and
MG, a main component of the GBM TME, and to intervene in this process for therapeutic purposes. The central
hypothesis is that CHI3L1-binding complexes with Gal3 and Gal3BP, reprogram TAM recruitment, polarization,
and cytokine production, which dysregulates antitumor TIL infiltration and activation to facilitate GBM growth,
progression, and resistance to immunotherapy. To test our hypothesis, we propose to 1) delineate mechanisms
of CHI3L1-binding complexes in TAM recruitment and polarization; 2) decipher how CHI3L1-reprogrammed
TAMs mediate GBM immunosuppression, and 3) assess the preclinical efficacy of disrupting CHI3L1-binding
complexes in promoting GBM response to immune checkpoint blockade. To accomplish these aims, we will
employ in vitro and in vivo gain/loss-of-function approaches to elucidate how CHI3L1-binding complexes regulate
the TAMs and TILs in immune evasion. To advance a potential direction for translational research, we will test a
newly-developed peptide alone and in combination therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors in preclinical
glioma mouse models. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it is based on a new
mechanism of CHI3L1-binding complexes regulating GBM immunosuppression. The proposed research is
significant because it is expected to provide a strong scientific rationale for the development of effective therapies
for GBM patients. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential of offering new opportunities for cancer
treatment."
10835121,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The notable protective effect of pregnancy on women’s tobacco and other drug use is a common yet
understudied phenomenon in which addictive processes are temporarily attenuated in the absence of
treatment. Identifying underlying mechanisms would provide novel insights into how addictive processes could
be more effectively disrupted.
 To accelerate progress towards this goal and overcome methodologic limitations of prior studies, we
repurpose multiple existing datasets with unique features to accomplish our aims. Specifically, we will:
1. Utilize a within-person design to estimate the unique “effect” of pregnancy, and salient events of
 pregnancy, on smoking behavior within a single pregnancy.
2. Isolate and estimate the impact of general and parenting-related developmental influences on smoking by
 examining between-pregnancy differences in a subset of women who were assessed on two pregnancies.
3. Examine the role of prenatal reflective functioning, coded from existing gold-standard qualitative interviews,
 in pregnancy’s protective effect on smoking.
Aims 1 & 2 will provide the first ever estimates of precisely when and how pregnancy interacts with smoking
behavior, setting the stage for future work to specify novel intervention targets. As reflective functioning is
known to be malleable in substance using pregnant women, understanding its role in pregnancy-associated
change in smoking will provides the foundation for novel smoking cessation interventions.
 This innovative proposal blends hypotheses generated from Dr. Massey’s (MPI) day-to-day clinical work as
an addiction psychiatrist with the cutting-edge quantitative and methodological expertise necessary to
rigorously test these hypotheses provided by epidemiologist Dr. Allen (MPI). Cohorts to be integrated contain
short-term (within pregnancy) and long-term (across multiple pregnancies) longitudinal data, state-of-the-art
drug exposure measures, and both qualitative and quantitative maternal data contributed by an experienced
team of established developmental scientists: Drs. Neiderhiser (Co-I), Eiden (Co-I), and Wakschlag (Co-I).
 As data were originally developed with NIDA’s support to examine drug-exposed children, they are
uniquely suited to examine drugs alone, and in combination. Knowledge from this study is needed to improve
and personalize prenatal interventions and to guide future investigations of exposure-related offspring
outcomes. Elucidating mechanisms underlying pregnancy’s protective effect on drug use also informs a
broader understanding of how social processes successfully compete with addictive processes."

Deformability and non-adherence are the most intrinsic biorheological properties of red blood cells (RBCs), as
they play a critical role in modulating RBC perfusion through the microvasculature. In acquired or inherited blood
disorders, such as sickle cell disease (SCD), these two interrelated properties are pathologically altered. SCD is
an autosomal recessive disorder associated with considerable morbidity and mortality in its afflicted populations.
In SCD, RBCs undergo radical morphological and structural transformations leading to decreased deformability
and increased adhesiveness, which further trigger vascular complications and a number of co-morbidities
including painful crises, stroke, acute chest syndrome, and organ failure. OcclusionChip is a novel standardized
in vitro microfluidic assay to measure microvascular occlusion mediated by RBCs in a wide range of clinical conditions.
The unique design embodies the two key features of the capillary bed: a gradient of microcapillary networks and side
passageways mimicking the arteriovenous anastomoses. Occlusion Index, measured by the OcclusionChip assay,
may serve as a new standard parameter to evaluate the clinical efficacy of treatments improving red blood cell
adhesion and deformability, such as hemoglobin modifying drugs, anti-sickling agents, and emerging genetic
therapies. The objective of this STTR Phase I/II Fast-Track project is to translate and commercialize novel
OcclusionChip microfluidic technology as a standardized and validated companion diagnostic assay for SCD.
In Phase I, we propose to streamline the manufacturing process with a third-party manufacturer and establish
quality control strategy.
In Phase II, we propose to contract manufacture a large number of devices (1000), establish analytical validation
and clinical validation relative to conventional, targeted, or curative therapies in SCD.
Our goal is to establish the manufacturability, analytical validation, and clinical utility of the OcclusionChip in
providing comprehensive functional characterization of red cell biorheological properties and assessment of
patient-specific response to emerging targeted and curative therapies in SCD."

The retina, an outgrowth of the brain, is often referred to as the “window of the brain”. The retina and the brain
are both associated with various neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-related
macular degeneration (AMD). AD and AMD share similar neuropathological conditions, with AD characterized
by extra-cellular amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, and AMD diagnosed by the presence of drusen
deposits. Mounting evidence suggests that AD also results in visual deficits and pathological changes in the
retinas of AD patients, including the extensive loss of optic nerve and retinal ganglion cells, thinning of the retinal
nerve fiber layer, and vascular abnormalities. Although the biochemical analysis of drusen deposits in AMD has
shown remarkable similarities to the AD deposits, the underlying molecular mechanisms that lead to their
similarity are still unknown.
This study aims to identify shared cell types and common cellular pathways between AD and AMD through
comparative single-cell data analysis. To achieve this goal, we propose two aims. Aim 1 will harmonize BRAIN
Initiative generated single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) data with
snRNA-seq data generated from AD brains to produce a fully harmonized, denoised, batch effect corrected, and
annotated sc/snRNA-seq dataset that will be ready for differential gene expression and cell-cell communication
analysis. Using the harmonized data obtained from Aim 1, Aim 2 will conduct cell-type-specific differential gene
expression and cell-cell communication analysis between AD and normal brains. We will further conduct
comparative analysis with cell-type-specific changes obtained from our parent R01 that focuses on AMD. By
comparing the changes in AD brains and AMD eyes at the cell-type-specific level, we will identify shared cell
types and common pathways between these two diseases. Findings from this application will address key
knowledge gaps in the degeneration mechanisms of AD and AMD, elucidate the connections between these two
diseases, and seed cell-specific functional studies, in vivo modeling, and precision therapeutic targeting of both
AD and AMD."

Asthma is a severe long-term disease of the lungs affecting millions of children in the US. An infection by
Rhinovirus (RV) is the most common trigger of an asthma attack which can be life threating for children with a
pre-existing condition. There are significant racial and ethnic disparities in asthma-related conditions where
African American and Hispanic children are more likely to have a diagnosis of asthma and significantly higher
asthma-related morbidity in comparisons with non-Hispanic white children. Genetic factors alone or in
combination with differences in environment exposures or lifestyle are important but have not been able to fully
explain observed disparities. Social environment such as chronic stressors experienced by racial and ethnic
minority groups have been linked to increased susceptibility to infection and chronic illness including asthma.
We hypothesize that social disadvantages during childhood result in long-lasting epigenetic alterations in key
regulatory regions impacting immune cell gene function that negatively impacts antiviral defense and
subsequently increase the risk of asthma. Our goal is to combine population-based epigenome mapping in nasal
mucosa with single immune cell analysis in large pediatric asthma cohorts of African American children with
detailed information about asthma and viral status as well as chronic stress exposures of several domains. In
Aim 1, we will implement an epigenome enrichment assay using our Methylation Capture Sequencing approach
to query the complete functional methylome in nasal mucosa (estimated to cover ~3M dynamic CpGs) derived
from thousands of children. We will deploy the approach in well-characterized pediatric cohorts to explore
predictive power of nasal epigenome signatures to capture chronic stress, viral infection along with asthma
phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will profile the immune cell landscape by high-throughput transcriptomic and
epigenome assays at single-cell resolution in hundreds of children with asthma. We will focus our single-cell
profiling efforts in blood derived from RV infected children that are exposed to high vs. low levels of chronic
stress to characterize immune cell signaling and viral response mechanisms epigenetically altered as a
consequence of social experiences. In Aim 3, we will perform in vitro validations of RV response in primary
macrophages differentiated from circulating monocytes from children that are discordant for chronic stress
exposure. We will perform detailed single-cell transcriptome and epigenome mapping before and after in vitro
infection with RV which will allow us to quantify the effects of social disadvantages on immune gene expression
at baseline and in response to RV infection.
Overall, our program will provide new insight into how genes and the social environment combine to influence
heterogeneity in the response to environmental stressors and contribute to the health disparity seen in children
with asthma."

 Relative to the general population, HIV-infected individuals have a 60–200-fold higher relative risk to
develop Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas, including plasmablastic lymphoma, primary central nervous system
lymphoma, primary effusion lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. They also have an 8–10-fold higher
relative risk to develop Hodgkin's Lymphoma compared to uninfected individuals. Many of these malignancies
are driven by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and result from poor immune control of the virus driven by HIV-
dependent immune dysfunction. Thus, a safe and effective vaccine that prevents EBV infection and eliminates
the EBV-associated component of risk could have a significant clinical benefit in resource-poor areas where
HIV-1 is endemic. The correlate of protection for most successful viral vaccines is neutralizing antibodies.
 Previously, our lab isolated the first anti-EBV mAb that could potently neutralize infection of both B cells
and epithelial cells. We further demonstrated that passive transfer of AMMO1 protected both humanized mice
and rhesus macaques from experimental EBV infection. These results strongly suggest that antibodies are
important for, if not sufficient to protect against EBV infection, and that a prophylactic vaccine should seek to
elicit high titers of AMMO1-like antibodies. To this end, we developed and tested several gH/gL vaccines. All
gH/gL vaccines were strongly immunogenic, but they only showed partial protection against experimental EBV
infection in humanized mice and macaques. Epitope mapping studies revealed that vaccine-elicited gH/gL
antibodies targeting the AMMO1 epitope were subdominant and rare, while antibodies targeting other non-
neutralizing epitopes on gH/gL were immunodominant.
 The goal of this proposal is to obtain a high-resolution antigenic landscape of the gH/gL glycoprotein to
define the most critical sites of vulnerability. We will then use this this information to employ structure guided
EBV vaccine design intended to immunofocus the antibody response onto protective epitopes like the one
targeted by AMMO1, and evaluate their ability to protect against EBV challenge in humanized mice and
macaques."

Novel vaccine strategies is needed to develop a safe, effective, and broadly accessible HIV vaccine to
end the HIV pandemic. This proposal is built upon several innovative advancements. First, learned from
natural immunity observed in a group of HIV resistant Kenyan female sex workers, we found 12 protease
cleavage sites (PCS) in HIV are critical for virus maturation due to their essential function in tightly
controlled cleavage of Gag, Gag-Pol, and Nef precursor proteins. Sequences surrounding the HIV PCS
are immunogenic and highly conserved across global HIV subtypes, thereby a vaccine based on 12 PCS
immunogens will be globally accessible and likely to prevent virus escape mutations. Further, our recent
studies demonstrated that a PCS vaccine delivered by recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)
vector and nanoformulation protected more than 80% of vaccinated female Mauritian cynomolgus
macaques (MCMs) against SIVmac251 intravaginal challenges, which is associated with vaccine elicited
potent PCS-specific CD8 T cell responses. However, in previous studies, 12 PCS immunogens were
individually expressed in the rVSV. To improve vaccine immunogen presentation and facilitate the
vaccine preparation, 12 PCS immunogens should be expressed in a single cassette, i.e., multi-epitope
PCS (MEPCS). i.e., multi-epitope PCS (MEPCS). To that end, we have developed a cold-chain friendly
and long-term stable MEPCS-mRNA-LNP vaccine. We found that SIV MEPCS-mRNA-LNP vaccine
induced a potent PCS-specific CD8 T-cell immunity without inducing generalized inflammation and CD4
T-cell activation. Based on our strong preliminary date, we hypothesize that MEPCS vaccines would
protect rhesus macaques against SIVmac251 rectal transmission. The reason we will use a rhesus
macaque (RM)-SIV rectal challenge model is that the effectiveness of MEPCS vaccine needs to be
validated in the most rigorous rhesus macaques and anal sex is the most common HIV transmission in
the United States of America. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of cold-
chain friendly and long-term stable MEPCS-mRNA-LNP vaccine in comparison with rVSV-MEPCS
vaccines in protecting RMs against SIVmac251 intrarectal challenge and to better understand the
immune correlated protection. in this proposed study we will comparatively evaluate the effectiveness of
MEPCS-mRNA-LNP with rVSV-MEPCS vaccines against SIVmac251 intrarectal challenge in RMs. The
proposed study has the great potential to develop a new HIV/SIV vaccine to prevent HIV/SIV rectal
transmission. The novel MEPCS immunogens plus the cold-chain friendly and long-term stable mRNA-
LNP formulation makes this proposed study highly innovative and significant.

interdisciplinary work, built on a robust collaborative research program within BUSPH and with outside
research partners and designed to provide research training that is interdisciplinary in spirit, substance and
outcome. We will recruit four pre-doctoral trainees each year for a steady state census of twelve trainees and
build on a demonstrated record of recruiting trainees from underrepresented groups. EECS trainees typically
receive support from the training grant during the first three years and then transition to external research
grants awarded either to the trainee (e.g., NIH F awards, EPA STAR fellowships) or to faculty advisors (e.g.,
NIH R01 awards). An advisor is assigned upon entering the program to assist with selecting courses,
identifying research rotations, and developing dissertation plans. A core curriculum provides training in
environmental health, epidemiology, biostatistics, community-engaged research methods, toxicology, and
physiology. Clusters of advanced courses are tailored to areas of ongoing research such as epidemiologic
methods, exposure science, and environmental health disparities. Trainees engage in three research rotations
on active projects during their first year, which facilitates integration into the program and refinement of
research interests. Additionally, the program provides regular opportunities for oral presentation, teaching,
grant proposal writing, and research translation, including a required ""lay summary"" of their research findings
to relevant community stakeholders. With the support of a new grant writing workshop, trainees prepare a
dissertation proposal in the form of a fellowship grant to be submitted to a funding agency (e.g., NIEHS) by the
end of their fifth semester, before qualifying exams. Upon passing their exams, trainees establish a dissertation
committee and engage in full-time research activities. Key enrichment activities include a weekly departmental
research seminar, a biweekly proseminar, a monthly journal club, an annual research retreat, and explicit
instruction in the responsible conduct of research and enhancing reproducibility. The Training Program
Steering Committee (TPSC) reviews the progress of each trainee with respect to program milestones via
course grades and progress reports. The EECS program is evaluated via feedback from trainees at the end of
each semester, critical examination of successes and failures by the TPSC, reviews conducted by partnering
community organizations, and monitoring of graduates to track career paths and productivity."
10835897,"Background: Recently, VA underwent two unprecedented disruptive changes that fundamentally altered how
care is delivered to Veterans. First, the VA MISSION Act was implemented in June 2019. Arguably the biggest
policy change in VA care delivery since the ""Kizer revolution,” MISSION’s purpose is to improve Veteran
access to care, especially for services that have traditionally been resource-limited in VA due to geographic/
temporal barriers (e.g., specialty care). While VA healthcare systems were still in the early phases of adapting
to MISSION, the COVID pandemic spread rapidly across the world, resulting in a sudden and prolonged ramp-
down of elective outpatient care across the entire US healthcare system. VAMCs nationwide are independently
adapting to these disruptive changes in ways that directly impact Veterans’ health and experience.
Significance/Impact: Currently, we know little about MISSION’s early effects on where and how Veterans
access specialty care (as moderated by COVID-related disruptions), or factors influencing community care
referral. We also lack a clear understanding of how individual VAMCs are responding to these disruptive forces
in realigning organizational strategy/structure to optimize performance. Addressing these knowledge gaps is
critical to assessing the long-term impacts of MISSION and COVID on VA specialty care delivery and helping
VAMCs to tailor adaptation approaches to their local setting to optimize the health and experience of Veterans.
Innovation: Expansion of VA community care under the MISSION Act represents one of the largest natural
experiments in delivery transformation in any U.S. healthcare system in modern times. Thus, VA community
care expansion under MISSION offers an unparalleled opportunity to study the relationship between rapid
environmental change, organizational adaptation, and long-term performance. The unanticipated system
""reset"" caused by COVID will only amplify and accelerate the adaptation process already underway.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Examine the relationship between VAMC organizational/environmental characteristics
and longitudinal performance under MISSION/post-COVID, and the extent to which facility-level organizational
adaptation measurably impacts performance. Aim 2: Characterize variation in organizational adaptation by
high-performing tertiary VAMCs with different organizational/environmental characteristics. Aim 3: Explore how
the experience of Veterans with specialty care needs differs at high-performing VAMCs with distinct
organizational adaptation approaches.
Methodology: In Aim 1a, using a longitudinal pre-/post- comparison analysis, we will examine the relationship
between VAMC organizational/environmental characteristics and longitudinal performance under
MISSION/post-COVID, including measures of access, care coordination, and community care referral. In Aim
1b, using a difference-in-differences approach, we will leverage differences in financial incentives between
VAMCs to empirically assess the effect of VAMC organizational adaptation on longitudinal rates of VA
community care referral and other outcomes. In Aim 2, we will interview leadership at 12 high-performing Level
1 VAMCs with varying organizational/environmental attributes to characterize variation in adaptation
approaches under MISSION/post-COVID. In Aim 3, we will explore how VAMC organizational adaptation
impacts Veterans’ specialty care experience through qualitative interviews of 48 Veterans at select Aim 2 sites.
Implementation/Next Steps: This study will provide critical information about where and how Veterans access
specialty care under MISSION/post-COVID, how high-performing tertiary VAMCs with different organizational/
environmental characteristics are adapting to enhance specialty care delivery under MISSION/post-COVID,
and how variation in these adaptation approaches affects the Veteran experience of care. Grant products will
provide vital information to VHA leaders about how tertiary VAMCs with unique facility-level characteristics can
best adapt their organizational approaches to optimize performance and enhance the Veteran care experience."

Ischemic stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in the United States. Fortunately, the landscape of
stroke patient management has been changing by endovascular mechanical thrombectomy (EVT) in recent
years. EVT is an interventional procedure to remove a stroke-causing thrombus (clot) from a cerebral artery to
induce recanalization. It stands to reason that further improvements of EVT in safety and efficacy will continue
to improve stroke outcomes. One key to the success of EVT is patient selection using perfusion imaging that
assesses the viability of the downstream vascular bed and collaterals. Salvageable tissue will likely benefit
from reperfusion by EVT, whereas the risk of post-recanalization hemorrhagic transformation (HT) is larger
when infarct (dead tissue) size is large (>50–70 ml). Cerebral collateral circulation keeps salvageable tissue
viable and slows down the infarct core growth; however, the strength of the collateral circulation varies strongly
between patients and it is expected to become insufficient over time (even within the time window in which
EVT is offered). Therefore, it is essential to assess the risk–benefit ratio of EVT for each patient using
perfusion imaging; however, the problem with the current standard of care is an inability to perform real-time,
intra-operative brain perfusion imaging. In this project, we propose to develop a novel method called IPEN v2
to perform quantitative brain perfusion imaging in the interventional suite using standard x-ray angiography
images. IPEN (Intra-intervention PErfusion with No gantry rotation) will provide the interventional radiologist
critical, real-time, information to take multiple steps to perform EVT safely and more effectively. Under an R21
project, we developed IPEN v1 which can assess the 3D tissue perfusion of multiple volumetric regions-of-
interest (ROIs) directly from angiography images. A simulation study for liver tumor oncology showed that the
perfusion indices were accurate even though ROIs were overlapped in angiography images. Building upon this
foundation, Specific Aim 1 of this project is to develop IPEN v2 for brain perfusion assessment. Specific Aim 2
is to validate IPEN v2 using patient data. We will retrospectively access 300 sets of stroke patient data
acquired via standard of care and validate IPEN with multiple aspects. Specific Aim 3 is to assess IPEN v2
using computer simulated data. By the end of this project, we will have IPEN v2 fully developed and validated
to enable the necessary improvements of EVT. We will then start the conversation with manufactures for
implementing IPEN in their angiography systems."

Worldwide it is estimated that over 6 million people die each year as a result of sepsis. There
are few clinical treatment options for patients, therefore, it is critical to determine the molecular
mechanisms that occur during sepsis in order to identity new targets for therapeutic intervention.
Here we identify the long noncoding RNA, GAPLINC, as a conserved gene between human and
mice that is highly expressed in macrophages. We show that GAPLINC knockouts are resistant
to LPS induced septic shock. The overall aim of this proposal is to determine how GAPLINC
contributes to the immune response that leads to septic shock. In Aim 1 we will utilize our
genetic mouse models to expand on our initial findings and determine what impact knockout or
overexpression of GAPLINC has in response to gram negative induced sepsis in vivo. In Aim 2
we will determine the molecular mechanisms utilized by GAPLINC to influence immune genes.
We will identify the minimal region within GAPLINC required to impact gene expression. We will
determine the complexes GAPLINC makes either with RNA or proteins to function and finally we
will identify any structural features within GAPLINC that mediates these interactions. In Aim 3
we will determine if GAPLINC is functionally conserved in humans by studying its role in
controlling immune genes in primary human monocyte derived macrophages. This project will
enable us to better understand the complex mechanisms that are at play during bacterial
induced sepsis. By focusing on GAPLINC we will identify a new layer of regulation during sepsis
providing us with new avenues for future drug development."
10836598,"Project 2: Abstract
Despite significant endeavors in prevention and control, malaria remains a formidable and persistent public
health threat in Southeast Asia. Zoonotic malaria caused by Plasmodium knowlesi is a growing challenge to
malaria control in Southeast Asia. Despite reported human cases, knowledge on the distribution and behavior
of P. knowlesi vectors remains limited. Deforestation and agricultural activities are linked to zoonotic malaria,
but their mechanisms are not fully understood. While P. knowlesi vectors are typically forest-dwelling
mosquitoes, some species dominate in deforested agricultural villages. Insecticide resistance complicates
control efforts. Widespread use of indoor residual spraying and insecticide-treated nets has altered mosquito
species, abundance, susceptibility, and biting behaviors. However, the impact on P. knowlesi vectors and
disease transmission is uncertain. Addressing these gaps is crucial for effective malaria management.
Therefore, the overarching objectives of this project are to 1) investigate how environmental changes affect
human and zoonotic malaria transmission in Southeast Asia; 2) enhance understanding of vector behavioral
ecology, population dynamics, vector competence, insecticide resistance, and the genetic basis underlying
these factors; and 3) assess novel vector control methods targeting Anopheles malaria vectors in controlled
environments. This knowledge will play a pivotal role in shaping zoonotic vector control programs and providing
a fundamental knowledge base for the development of enhanced tools in vector control."

Over 1 million people in the United States are living with multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease that
has significant impacts on physical functioning and, consequently, health-related quality of life.
However, a psychometrically sound, publicly available measure of physical function optimized for
persons with MS developed from the patient perspective has not been recognized by FDA as fit-
for-purpose for use in drug development. We propose the preparation and submission of a Full
Qualification Package (FQP) to support the qualification of the PROMIS / Quality of Life in
Neurological Disorders™ (Neuro-QoL™) Physical Function Measure for Multiple Sclerosis
(PROMISnq PFMS—15a) as a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure of physical function in
people diagnosed with all forms of MS.
A measure of physical function was accepted into the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research’s
(CDER’s) Clinical Outcome Assessment (COA) Qualification Program under DDT #000123 on
June 21, 2017. The PRO Consortium’s MS Working Group selected the PROMISnq PFMS—15a
as the physical function measure for qualification as it has been optimized for use in persons with
MS and has qualitative evidence supporting its content validity. Next, a Qualification Plan (QP)
was submitted to FDA on November 29, 2021. The QP addressed the Working Group’s research
plan for obtaining quantitative evidence to support qualification of the measure. After FDA
acceptance of the QP, the next steps will be to analyze cross-sectional and longitudinal datasets
from the United Kingdom MS Register Study and the University of Washington MS Psychometric
Evaluation Study to generate quantitative evidence and to prepare and submit an FQP.
Our approach includes 3 aims. For Aim 1, we will analyze available cross-sectional and
longitudinal datasets that include the PROMISnq PFMS—15a in accordance with the accepted
QP and statistical analysis plan to document its validity, reliability, and responsiveness as an
outcome measure in people with all forms of MS. For Aim 2, we will prepare an FQP for the
PROMISnq PFMS—15a using the CDER COA FQP content outline and integrate all evidence
supporting the measure, including results of the completed qualitative and quantitative research.
Aim 3 will involve the submission of the FQP with all necessary appendices and attachments,
including a user manual and the associated analysis datasets and programming code. The goal
of this project will be a publicly available and accessible PRO measure for assessing physical
function in MS clinical trials for people with all forms of MS. As such, qualifying the PROMISnq
PFMS—15a will fill a critical gap in the measurement of physical function in MS treatment trials."

This R61/R33 application is responsive to PAR-18-829, issued by the National Center for Complementary and
Integrative Health (NCCIH). In the R61 phase, the award will support the development of a three-armed
clinical trial to assess the ability of 5-hydroxtryptophan (5-HTP), creatine monohydrate, and their combination
to alter three distinct biomarkers of depression in persons already taking antidepressants: 1) frontal cortical
bioenergetics as measured by phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy; 2) subgenual cingulate cortex
functional connectivity as measured by resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging; and 3) whole-
blood serotonin levels. The study is motivated by evidence that relative hypoxia contributes to depression risk.
It has been repeatedly demonstrated that persons with hypoxic medical conditions such as asthma and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease are at higher risk of depression and suicide than both health controls and
persons with non-hypoxic medical conditions. Similarly, it has been observed that, compared to the rest of the
United States, mountain states like Utah have higher rates of major depressive disorder and suicide, which are
not fully explained by other sociodemographic factors. Chronic hypoxia due to altitude of residence may
mediate this, via alterations in brain bioenergetics or serotonin synthesis. These deficits could be corrected via
supplementation with creatine and 5-HTP, respectively. In the R61 phase, we will conduct a randomized,
double-blind, three-armed trial to investigate (Aim 1) the effect of supplementation with the combination of 5-
HTP and creatine on spectroscopic markers of depression in persons living at high altitude who have not
responded sufficiently to standard antidepressants, as well as (Aim 2) alterations in resting-state functional
connectivity in subjects with depression. To assess the ability of 5-HTP supplementation to affect serotonin
synthesis, we will also (Aim 3) measure subjects' blood serotonin levels before and after 8 weeks of treatment.
In the R33 phase, we will assess whether the above neurochemical correlates of depression and target
engagement are associated with antidepressant response. We hypothesize that dual augmentation with
creatine and 5-HTP will, compared to augmentation with either agent alone, enhance antidepressant
response in persons with MDD as measured by clinical outcomes. We further hypothesize that persons
who are responsive to combination treatment will exhibit normalization of markers of brain energy metabolism
measured by 31P-MRS and normalization of subgenual cingulate resting state functional connectivity. The
research plan described here will form the basis for a subsequent placebo-controlled R01-funded study
proposal to further assess the effectiveness of the study intervention for the treatment of MDD in persons with
depression that has not responded to first-line agents. This proposal and subsequent R01-level proposals will
directly inform the clinical care of MDD while helping to elucidate the mechanisms underpinning it."

The Administrative Core will provide the leadership, guidance, administrative support, financial
management and oversight to ensure the efficient resource management and success of the
Southern and Central Africa ICEMR. This will be achieved in part by hosting weekly project
meetings with all partners, coordinating meetings of the Scientific Advisory Group, participating
in annual ICEMR meetings, and preparing reports. The Administrative Core’s mid- and short-
term goals are to ensure that resources are managed efficiently and the planned research
activities are coordinated, tracked, reported, and completed within the proposed timelines. The
long-term goals of the Administrative Core are to ensure that the Southern and Central Africa
ICEMR makes substantial contributions to regional malaria control and elimination through
research and capacity building and the scope of work described for the two Research Areas and
the Data Management and Analytics and Computational Modeling Cores."
10837088,"Project Summary
This proposal investigates the mechanisms that control satiation. This is a fundamental problem in physiology
and also has relevance to obesity, because meal size is an important determinant of overall food intake. The
caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTS) contains key neural circuits for meal termination. These circuits
integrate input from vagal afferents innervating the abdominal viscera as well as circulating hormonal and
nutrient signals in order to trigger the termination of feeding. While cNTS cell types have long been studied
using a variety of approaches, their natural activity patterns during behavior are almost completely unknown.
Addressing this knowledge gap would reveal the nature of the key signals that regulate cNTS neurons during
normal feeding, how these signals are integrated in specific cell types, and how they evolve during the course
of a meal. In preliminary studies, we developed methods to record the activity of cNTS neurons in freely
behaving mice and characterized their dynamics during feeding and in response to a variety of visceral stimuli.
Here we propose to build on these findings to systematically dissect the signals that regulate cNTS satiety
circuits in vivo. In Aims 1 and 2, we manipulate inputs at various stages of the GI tract and measure how this
alters cNTS dynamics during feeding. In Aim 3, we use targeted optogenetic manipulations to boost or block
elements of the natural activity patterns of these neurons and measure how this alters food intake and meal
microstructure. Together, these experiments will reveal how the caudal brainstem dynamically integrates
diverse inputs to enable the moment-by-moment control of feeding behavior."
10851510,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Parent Award: Our brain is composed of an immense diversity of neurons that are molecularly,
morphologically, and functionally distinct. Understanding how this immense diversity of neuron types is
generated and organized to allow us and other adult animals to carry out such a vast array of complex tasks
and behaviors is of great importance. By far, most of the neurons in our adult brains are generated during
development, either directly or indirectly from the cell divisions of a defined but, rather heterogeneous
population of neural stem cells. Molecular differences exist among neural stem cells based on their location
and neural stem cell themselves can change their intrinsic genetic programs over time. Research outlined in
this proposal is geared towards better understanding of how neural stem cell extrinsic factors integrate with
neural stem cell intrinsic factors to control numbers and types of neurons produced through time and space
during development. Here, we use the genetically tractable model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, to
uncover the genetic pathways and molecular mechanisms regulating neural stem cell proliferation decisions,
from quiescence to proliferation, and then termination once development is complete. Our research goals
include gaining a better understanding of how dietary nutrient availability affects neural stem cell proliferation
decisions. Through genetic and single cell sequencing techniques, we are working to identify the intrinsic
differences among these neural stem cell types that distinguish nutrient-dependence versus nutrient-
independence. We are also working on determining how dietary nutrients consumed during development
regulate neural stem cell temporal programs and thus types and numbers of neurons produced. Altogether, the
research outlined here will advance our understanding of neural stem cell proliferation control during
development and how dietary nutrient availability affects types and numbers of neurons produced. These
insights should stimulate new discoveries in translational stem cell research in the context of normal
development and disease states.
Supplement request: In this proposal, we seek to better understand the extrinsic, systemic cues that regulate
neural stem cell proliferation decisions during development. This award will support technical training and
career development activities for a PhD student as the student pursues their dissertation work and prepares for
an upcoming NRSA F31 application."
10850774,"Man’s total environment including diet, lifestyle and environmental chemicals has a major impact on health. The
effects of environmental chemicals are most dramatic when they alter a regulatory system that amplifies the
toxicity. We will examine effects of toxins and disease on lipid chemical mediators or oxylipins. Deleterious effects
also are more global when the environmental chemicals alter a system fundamental to many cells and organs.
Thus, we will investigate how environmental chemicals increase endoplasmic reticulum stress resulting in
negative and often chronic outcomes in multiple organs. Natural epoxyfatty acids (EpFA) are a component of a
regulatory system that maintains homeostasis. We are using inhibitors of the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEHI)
to stabilize these beneficial EpFA. A variety of environmental chemicals such as triclosan and nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs damage these pathways enhancing disease states. sEHI restore the homeostatic systems
leading to improvement in many disease models including for diabetes, heart failure, neuropathic and
inflammatory pain, fibrosis and toxicities. Recently, we reported sEHI beneficial for treating cancer as well as
Parkinson’s and depression. With the flexibility offered by the RIVER program, we will evaluate the relationships
among these disease states, determine biochemical mechanisms, and monitor the levels of EpFA and other
chemical mediators. Based on this knowledge we will develop cellular and biochemical biomarkers of health and
disease particularly for diseases related to endoplasmic reticulum stress. We will continue providing the
biochemical and analytical tools developed for this work for the broad scientific community. These tools include
clones and proteins of the sEH enzyme, sEH inhibitors as probes and drugs, novel bioassays, antibodies and
nanobodies, synthetic standards of regulatory lipids, and of course analytical methods. We will expand our
testing of the hypothesis that toxicity and disease can be altered by pharmacological and nutritional intervention
both in house and with collaborators. In particular, we will expand our recent studies that by stabilizing natural
omega 6 and omega 3 fatty acid epoxides, sEHI can prevent and reverse symptoms of depression, Parkinson’s
disease and other CNS disorders and block tumor resurgence and metastasis caused by cell debris from cancer
chemotherapy and resection. Thus, we will test the hypothesis that the mitochondrial–ROS–ER stress axis is a
common mechanism in the onset of many toxicities and pathological outcomes and that these effects can be
prevented or reversed by increasing epoxyfatty acids. While carrying out the above research we continue and
expand our work to reduce barriers to entering the oxylipin research field by providing service and reagents. Our
research will be coupled with a training and outreach component to encourage collaboration and free information
exchange in the oxylipin discipline. The work is transformative in emphasizing chronic rather than short-term
toxicities, illustrating a new mechanism of toxicity in ER stress, and in exploring approaches to prevent the
toxicities by manipulating endogenous chemical mediators."

BRAIN pioneers are people who take on significant risk as participants in first-in-human or early
neurotechnology studies for the sake of helping to further science. Their willingness to try invasive and non-
medically necessary devices, their investments of significant time and energy, and their close relationships with
study teams, typically built over 3-5 years of intensive experiments, make them relatively unique as research
participants. Their well-being is integral to the continued development of the field of neural technology, yet
relatively little neuroethical attention has been focused on the structures of support, from researchers and from
family members, that enable BRAIN pioneers to successfully participate in neural device trials. In this study,
we: 1) Utilize an embedded ethicist to observe interactions between participants in long-term, implantable
neural device trials, their family partners, and the research team to identify modes of care and support provided
in the experimental setting; 2) Use qualitative interviewing to explore how participants, family members and
researchers articulate the role, benefits, and limitations of family and researcher care and support before,
during, and after a trial; and 3) Develop recommendations for best practices for a more inclusive support

improve the reproductive health of women over the lifespan."
10851191,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The long-term goal of this proposal is to determine how chronic alcohol intake modulates the liver-to-brain
axis to induce and/or promote Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. Studies have largely focused on the direct
action of alcohol on the brain and studies looking outside the brain to understand how alcohol modulates AD
pathology are lacking. Our exciting preliminary data have identified two potential alcohol-induced changes to the
liver that could induce and/or promote AD pathology in the brain. First, we have discovered that chronic alcohol
feeding reduces hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LRP1), a receptor essential in removing peripheral
Aβ. Since peripheral Aβ can be transported across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by receptor for advanced
glycation end products (RAGE) and become deposited in the brain, it is conceivable that altered LRP1-mediated
hepatic Aβ clearance can significantly affect brain Aβ load. Second, our work shows that peripheral tumor
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secreted by the liver and other organs during alcohol-induced injury can greatly impact
the BBB and AD pathology. In AD transgenic mice, peripheral TNF-α blockage by the TNFR-Fc fusion protein
(etanercept) reduces AD pathology, and our exciting preliminary data shows enhanced Aβ(1-42) migration
across the brain endothelium due to TNF-α-mediated increase in BBB-permeability in vitro. This proposal will
explore these novel findings to provide an integrated examination of how alcohol intake may alter the liver-to-
brain axis to induce and/or promote AD pathology. The proposal has two specific aims: 1) Delineate the effect
of alcohol on Aβ clearance by the liver and examine its impact on peripheral-to-central Aβ homeostasis. Our
working hypothesis is that alcohol intake alters hepatic peripheral Aβ clearance through LRP1 downregulation
to increase peripheral-to-central Aβ load. 2) Characterize the effect of alcoholic-liver-injury-induced peripheral
inflammation on neurovascular- and neuronal-degeneration, and its impact on AD pathology. Our working
hypothesis is that alcoholic-liver-injury-induced peripheral inflammation causes BBB dysfunction, increases AD
hallmark pathology (Aβ and tau-tangles), and modulates neuroinflammation, thereby inducing and/or potentiating
AD pathology. The proposal will combine specialists in the areas of liver/alcohol research with those in AD/BBB
research to provide a comprehensive exploration of the liver-to-brain axis utilizing state-of-the-art in vivo and in
vitro techniques and models, which will increase synergy and likelihood of success. The resulting new knowledge
will enable the identification of new therapeutic-targets and provide mechanistic insight into alcohol-dependent
AD, and will delineate the importance of the liver-to-brain axis in AD pathology, an unexplored concept in the
emerging field of alcohol-dependent AD."

Compared to adolescents or adults in mid-life, young adults are at higher risk of death and disease from a variety
of causes, most of which are preventable, such as mental health problems, substance use, sexually transmitted
infections, homicides, and motor vehicle accidents. Although early adulthood is an important period to
understand, little research has focused on cross-cultural heterogeneity in potential risk and protective factors
during early adulthood. The proposed research builds on the ongoing Parenting Across Cultures longitudinal
study that began in 2008 with recruitment of a sample of 1,417 8-year-old children and their mothers and fathers
from 9 countries (China, Colombia, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, Philippines, Sweden, Thailand, and the United States).
We have since assessed families annually through interviews with children, mothers, and fathers about the
parent-child relationship, the child’s adjustment, attitudes and beliefs, and cultural values, with 90% retention of
the original sample. During the next project period, the original child participants will be 22 to 26 years old,
providing an unprecedented opportunity to understand how childhood and adolescent experiences in the most
diverse long-term longitudinal study ever conducted culminate in adjustment during early adulthood. We will
conduct interviews annually with young adults and their parents to assess family and cultural influences on
decisions, risks, competencies, and opportunities during this developmental period that is characterized by major
health risks and transitions in education, work, residential status, intimate partnerships, and parenthood.
We address three aims: (1) We will build a developmental model of young adult adjustment and maladjustment
using mediators and moderators at the individual, family, and culture levels, including potential risk and protective
factors. (2) We will examine predictors of parent-young adult relationships across cultures that normatively differ
in how changes in family relationships are experienced and negotiated in early adulthood. (3) We will examine
the impact of COVID-related disruptions in education, work, and other important domains on subsequent
adjustment. We have collected data on COVID-related experiences every 3 months since the start of the
pandemic, situating us well to be able to examine these experiences in relation to adjustment in the aftermath of
the pandemic. Addressing these aims in the most diverse, prospectively studied, multi-national sample to date
will have major public health implications in informing scientific understanding of predictors of adjustment during
early adulthood, a developmental period characterized by high morbidity and mortality due to mental health
problems, substance use, and other largely preventable causes, as well as opportunities for positive adaptation.
This work will inform programming and policy to improve population health and well-being by identifying novel
targets for prevention and intervention in the United States, while also advancing the Sustainable Development
Goals adopted by the United Nations to guide the international development agenda through 2030."

 Project Summary
Emerging evidence suggests a bidirectional relationship between sleep disturbance and alterations in the gut
microbiome. This study aims to examine the effect of sleep health and dysfunction in influencing cognition
while accounting for the role of the gut microbiome in a community-based Latinx sample. Despite its
importance, studies exploring the effect of sleep on the gut microbiome, and the subsequent effect on the
cognition of humans are extremely limited. Of the preliminary investigations that do exist, none have been
conducted with Latinx community-living samples. While Latinx samples were the focus of two gut microbiome
studies, which provided preliminary evidence for the unique gut microbiome of this population, our
proposed study is innovative in that it includes cognitive measures, cortisol sampling, and objective measures
of sleep. Guided by the National Institutes of Minority Health and Health Disparities Framework, we will also
explore sociocultural factors at various levels of influence that may impact sleep, cognition, and the gut
microbiome. There is an urgent need for studies of this kind given that the gut microbiome may have a direct
effect on cognition and sleep, positioning it as a modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline. Sleep disturbance,
a modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline, including Alzheimer's disease, is bidirectionally-related to the gut
microbiome, variations in sleep patterns affect the structure and diversity of the gut microbiome, and the gut
microbiome is influential in circadian cycles and hormones related to sleep and waking. Investigations
examining the microbiota-gut-brain axis are essential in community-based samples to identify modifiable risk
factors for cognitive decline and inform novel interventions. We will recruit 150 Latinx midlife adults through
staggered recruitment and leveraging our existing resources: for a total of 450 observations. Each participant
will be administered a battery of neurocognitive and sleep assessments and will provide objective sleep data
through a wrist-worn actigraphy device, 3 saliva samples in one day to assess salivary cortisol, and a stool
sample to examine the gut microbiome through whole-genome shotgun sequencing. Using this data, we will
examine four aims: Aim 1. Using integrated microbiome analyses, we will examine correlations between gut
microbiome profiles, and measures of cognition. Aim 2. We will examine the bivariate relationship between
sleep and gut microbiome profiles. Aim 3a: We will examine the relation between sleep and measures of
cognition. Aim 3b: We will examine the interconnections between gut microbiome profiles, measures of
cognition, and sleep using two mediation models. Aim 4: We will examine the interrelations between gut
microbiome profiles, stress (salivary cortisol), measures of cognition, and sleep. Using an integrated analysis
of the gut microbiome, cognition, stress through salivary cortisol, and sleep measurements, our study will be
among the first to explore the interrelations of gut microbiome diversity, microbial profiles, stress, cognition,
and sleep to conduct future life course longitudinal studies and understand the changing effects over time."

Abstract
The FIU-RCMI Research Capacity Core (RCC) plans to continue building on our existing infrastructure with
added and expanded features to provide measurable and sustainable research resources and support to
underrepresented ESIs. FIU-RCMI scientific focus areas will include basic biomedical research, behavioral
research and population science, and clinical/health services research, with one R01-equivalent project in each
area. The RCC will add to the quality and productivity of health disparity research at FIU by: 1. Providing
infrastructure support and connecting underrepresented ESIs to resources; 2. Mentoring, training and guiding
underrepresented ESIs in contemporary quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods approaches to prepare
pilot proposals, conduct, analyze and publish data, and use it to develop competitive K and R applications; 3.
Convening senior investigators, mentors and mentees to provide educational opportunities; and 4. Creating
and improving scientific methods, metrics, measures and tools for health disparity research. Innovative aspects
of the RCC include more opportunities in data science and machine learning as well as qualitative and mixed
methods approaches, providing financial and collaborative methodological guidance for mentors, increasing
the focus on advancement of methods and metrics, and adding and mentoring underrepresented ESIs in core
leadership roles. The RCMI RCC has made an impact at a minority serving institution with over 2/3
Hispanic/Latinx student constituency, and 366 ESIs among whom 53% are women and over 40% are
underrepresented minorities. To date the RCC has sponsored 53 professional development and research in
progress events reaching a total of 1,349 attendees, provided methodological mentorship and support for pilot
program applicants and awardees, conducted needs assessment to guide the RCC activities, and created a
repository of research resources and disseminated the training and funding opportunities through various
platforms. Moving forward, the goal of the RCC is to provide consistent, rigorous, innovative, and sustainable
opportunities for training and mentorship across a spectrum of underrepresented ESIs at FIU, as well as newly
recruited faculty. This will be accomplished by executing the proposed aims with new and innovative aspects
and collaborating with internal and external partners that include the RCMI network of affiliated institutions as
well as the FIU-RCMI Investigator Development and Community Engagement Cores, and FIU-
STATCONSULT, a core facility in providing sustainable methodological research services to the university
community."

 Cytokinesis is the final stage of cell division, and is regulated by an evolutionarily conserved signaling
pathway in eukaryotic organisms ranging from yeast to humans. Trypanosoma brucei, a parasitic protozoan
and causative agent of human sleeping sickness, undergoes a distinct mode of cytokinesis by dividing along
the longitudinal cell axes uni-directionally from the anterior end of the new-flagellum daughter cell towards the
nascent posterior end of the old-flagellum daughter cell. T. brucei adopts a cytokinesis signaling pathway that
is totally different from its human host; therefore, cytokinesis can be exploited as a drug target for combating
this dreadful human pathogen. Despite the identification and the functional characterization of multiple
cytokinesis regulators, the functional interplay and the order of action among these regulators remain poorly
understood. Moreover, it remains also unclear how cleavage furrow ingression is initiated and regulated and
whether these identified cytokinesis regulators cooperate with certain cytoskeletal proteins at the cleavage
furrow to promote furrow ingression. The current proposal is built on the recently discovered cytokinesis
regulatory pathway, and aims to determine the functional interplay among known cytokinesis regulators and to
explore the mechanistic roles of kinesin proteins in promoting cytokinesis initiation and progression. In specific
Aim 1, we plan to carry out a systematic analysis of the functional interplay among the cytokinesis regulatory
proteins before and during cytokinesis. In Aim 2, we plan to dissect the function of a kinesin-13 family protein in
regulating cytokinesis initiation and integrate this kinesin into the existing cytokinesis regulatory pathway. In
Aim 3, we plan to investigate the mechanistic role of KLIF-associated cytoskeletal proteins and to explore their
functional interplay with KLIF and other cytokinesis regulators in driving cleavage furrow ingression. These
studies will facilitate the understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the unusual mode of
cytokinesis in T. brucei, and the outcomes from these investigations may provide new targets for
chemotherapeutic intervention."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) arises through T-cell mediated killing of the pancreatic beta-cells. It has a strong
genetic component, but environmental factors likely influence disease triggering as well as the post-onset
disease course. In human T1D families, we have identified an elevated inflammatory state that is consistent
with exposure to microbial antigens. In healthy siblings of probands, this familial innate inflammation is
supplanted by an age-dependent regulatory state that includes temporal increases in peripheral activated
regulatory T-cell frequencies. We have identified a similar inflammatory state in the BioBreeding DR rat model
of T1D. DR rats are not spontaneously diabetic, however T1D can be triggered in young animals by viral
infection. Importantly, the innate inflammatory state in DR rats is temporally supplanted by an IL-10/TGF-β-
mediated regulatory state that coincides with the inability of virus to induce T1D in older animals. In line with
studies that implicate an altered gastrointestinal microbiota in T1D pathogenesis, modulation of the microbiota
in healthy siblings of T1D probands or DR rats partially normalizes the underlying inflammatory state. In
BioBreeding rats, such treatments prevent development of T1D. Our studies suggest that T1D progression is
promoted when the genetically controlled but environmentally influenced familial innate state is augmented by
additional inflammatory signals prior to the establishment of robust counter-regulatory mechanisms. Our
studies have also focused on the persistence of insulin secretion after T1D onset, which is clinically significant
as even modest residual beta cell function is associated with reduced risk of complications. These studies
have utilized a plasma-based transcriptional bioassay that quantitatively captures inflammatory: regulatory
balance. Importantly, new onset T1D patients with short post-onset partial remissions, exhibit plasma based
signatures with predictively higher inflammatory bias, as well as reduced peripheral regulatory T-cell
abundances. In genetically susceptible healthy subjects and T1D patients, we hypothesize
that levels of immune activity are in part governed by composition of the microbiota and systemic microbial
antigen exposure. This in turn influences the rate of T1D progression as measured by duration of the post-
onset partial remission. With our large patient population and expertise, we are well-positioned to test the
hypothesis that the inflammatory state associated with T1D and T1D susceptibility can be partially normalized
through probiotic supplementation. We propose the following specific aims.
1. Determine whether Lactobacillus plantarum 299v supplement reduces systemic inflammation and
prolongs residual β-cell function in new onset T1D.
2. Define how L. plantarum 299v supplementation alters immune activity in new onset T1D."
10850642,"Helicobacter pylori infection of the stomach and the resulting clinical consequences of chronic gastritis, peptic
ulcer disease, and disease progression to gastric cancer remains a major health concern for Veterans. This
pathogen infects half of the world’s population, and gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths
worldwide. H. pylori prevalence in Veterans is high; deployment-related infection is a problem, especially
acquisition of strains associated with higher risk for carcinogenesis. The three polyamines, putrescine (Put),
spermidine (Spd), and spermine (Spm), are ubiquitous molecules with many biological effects. Put is synthesized
by the rate-limiting enzyme, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), and is converted sequentially to Spd and Spm,
which is back-converted to Spd by spermine oxidase (SMOX). Our Lab has had a long interest in the role of
polyamines in GI inflammation and carcinogenesis, and we have the following exciting findings pertinent to this
renewal grant: 1) Smox–/– mice infected with H. pylori exhibit decreased gastric inflammation, DNA damage, and
chemokine expression, associated with depletion of Spd; 2) These phenotypes are recapitulated in H. pylori-
infected 2D organoids from Smox–/– mice; 3) A new link between the H. pylori-induced pro-carcinogenic activation
of b-catenin and SMOX, including findings that Smox–/– mice and gerbils treated with a SMOX inhibitor have loss
of b-catenin activation in vivo; 4) Use of human gastric organoid cultures to demonstrate the effectiveness of a
novel and potent SMOX inhibitor in blocking H. pylori-induced b-catenin activation, associated with Spd
depletion; 5) Implication of a unique form of protein translation, hypusination, via the action of deoxyhypusine
synthase (DHPS), a process which has been linked to carcinogenesis and appears to be attenuated by Smox
deletion; 6) Demonstration of somatic genomic abnormalities by whole exome sequencing (WES) in gastritis and
dysplasia tissues of INS-GAS mice, a model of H. pylori-induced carcinogenesis. We will now make effective
use of important molecular tools, including valuable mutant mouse models, a key SMOX inhibitor, and advanced
use of 3D and 2D gastric organoids from mice and VA patients. We hypothesize that dysregulated polyamine
metabolism, due to SMOX and associated generation of Spd and hypusination, provides a molecular
pathway leading to risk for gastric disease progression to carcinogenesis. Our specific aims are: 1) To
directly determine the role of SMOX and Spd in gastric carcinogenesis. We will test: A) The effect of SMOX in
cancer-prone INS-GAS mice, analyzing H. pylori-induced carcinogenesis, DNA damage, b-catenin activation,
and GEC function in FVB/N INS-GAS Smox–/– mice +/- Spd; B) A novel, potent, second-generation SMOX
inhibitor, SLH150-54, in INS-GAS mice and gerbils; C) The effect of SMOX/Spd on the formation of somatic
genomic abnormalities using whole exome sequencing. 2) To determine if epithelial DHPS mediates deleterious
effects of SMOX/Spd in gastric carcinogenesis. We will analyze: A) The role of SMOX in hypusination during H.
pylori infection in C57BL/6 and FVB/N INS-GAS Smox–/– vs. WT mice +/- H. pylori +/- Spd; B) The effect of
hypusination in gastric epithelial cells (GECs) on inflammation and carcinogenesis, using C57BL/6 and FVB/N
INS-GAS mice with specific deletion of Dhps in GECs; C) the effect of DHPS/hypusination on somatic genomic
instability. 3) To utilize gastric organoid reporter systems in tissues from VA patients to establish human
biomarkers for carcinogenesis. H. pylori-induced DNA damage, b-catenin activation, and pathways identified in
Aims 1 and 2 will be studied, related to: A) Induction and role of SMOX, using CRISPR/CAS9-mediated deletion
of SMOX and SMOX inhibitors; and B) Induction and role of DHPS, using CRISPR/CAS9-mediated deletion of
DHPS and the DHPS inhibitor, GC7. This research program will provide crucial new insights into H. pylori-
induced inflammation and disease progression along the pathway to gastric carcinogenesis. The translation of
findings from valuable animal models into robust human organoid systems is expected to facilitate the validation
of new strategies for cancer risk assessment, chemoprevention, and treatment for VA patients."
10850643,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic metabolic dysfunction has emerged as one of the most severe medical problems worldwide, leading
to increases in type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular disease. The discovery of alternative
pathways to regulate whole-body glucose and energy metabolism is urgently needed to address this great
medical need. Such pathways could be exploited for new therapeutic strategies to combat diabetes and
insulin resistance. Using a multidisciplinary strategy combining computational, cellular, and in vivo
approaches, we have recently uncovered a new adipokine from thermogenic adipose, Isthmin-1 (Ism1), that
acts to promote glucose uptake in mouse and human adipocytes. The action of Ism1 requires PI3K/AKT
signaling but is entirely independent of the insulin receptor. In animals rendered diabetic by high-fat diet
feeding, administration of recombinant Ism1 protein or genetic elevation of circulating Ism1 improves
glucose homeostasis. However, more studies are needed in order to understand the contribution of Ism1 to
glucose metabolism, and to leverage this understanding for therapeutic purposes. The overall objectives in
this proposal are to establish how Ism1 can control blood glucose by determining the signaling effectors and
cell surface receptor that mediate the action, determine the endogenous physiological function for Ism1, and
evaluate the pharmacological potential of Ism1 as a therapeutic target. In Aim 1, we will utilize biochemical,
genetic, and proteomic methods to identify the signaling pathways and cell surface receptor responsible for
the signaling action and glucoregulatory mechanisms of Ism1. These studies will identify Ism1’s mechanism
of action and will be critical for our understanding of Ism1 signaling as an insulin-independent pathway to
regulate glucose uptake. In Aim 2, we will determine the physiological function for Ism1 using our generated
whole-body and adipocyte-specific Ism1 knockout mice. These studies are essential in determining the
endogenous role of Ism1 in glucose metabolism. In Aim 3, we will determine the minimal requirements for
Ism1 bioactivity by generating fragments, mutants, and engineered forms of Ism1. This aim will pave the
way for further optimization of a polypeptide hormone as a therapeutic agent, and will be essential in
understanding the effects of augmentation of this novel pathway physiology. These contributions are
expected to be significant because pathways that can regulate glucose independently of insulin will open
entirely new avenues to overcome insulin resistance and diabetes, which could have a significant public
health impact."

10850653,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Base excision repair (BER) is a critical mechanism for preventing the mutagenic and lethal consequences of
DNA damage generated by endogenous reactive chemical species or exposure to environmental hazards. BER
is multi-step pathway that requires a tight coordination between the repair proteins. The downstream steps of
BER pathway involves gap filling by DNA polymerase (pol) β and subsequent nick sealing by DNA ligase (ligase
I or IIIα). This step-to-step coordination is orchestrated by non-enzymatic scaffolding protein X-Ray Repair Cross
Complementing 1 (XRCC1) that plays a key role in assembling repair proteins. Although the roles of the individual
enzymes are largely studied, how the multi-protein BER complex coordinates while maintaining the repair
efficiency remains unclear. Though often considered an accurate process, the BER can contribute to genome
instability if normal coordination breaks down. For example, the mutations in the polβ gene that have been found
in many human cancers result in the modifications in its repair functions that impair BER efficiency. Similarly,
XRCC1 cancer-associated variants with a defective scaffolding role predispose the cell to genomic instability
and transformation. Failure in the BER pathway coordination could result in the formation of strand-break repair
intermediates that are more mutagenic or toxic than the initial DNA lesions. My research program will fill the
important gap of knowledge in the BER field by elucidating the molecular components of multi-protein BER
complex that are necessary for accurate repair and define the ramifications of defective pathway coordination
during DNA ligase I and IIIα activities. We are in a unique position to advance this scientific front based on our
strong track record and our multidisciplinary approach. In Project 1, we build off our substantial prior work using
biochemical and biophysical approach to define the molecular mechanism by which polβ, DNA ligases I and IIIα
execute the repair pathway coordination. Our studies will also elucidate cancer-associated XRCC1 and polβ
variants with altered BER functions as an important determinants of defective pathway coordination. In Project
2, using X-ray crystallography, we will elucidate the features of DNA substrate and ligase interaction that dictate
accurate versus mutagenic outcomes during final nick sealing step at atomic resolution. This project will be
extended with cryo-EM to define the structural architecture of large BER multi-protein complexes scaffolded by
XRCC1 that dictates accurate repair pathway coordination. With these 2 Projects, my laboratory will launch a
new and unique aspect of the research conducted by my group which seeks to better understand the mechanism
by which a multi-protein repair complex coordinate during BER and answer several key questions regarding how
a tight coordination is vital for maintaining the integrity of our genomic DNA, functions normally and how altering
these functions stemming from a failure in the repair pathway coordination leads to disease."
10850654,"Among the 30 million Americans with type 2 diabetes (T2D), physical activity is prospectively
associated with better glycemic control, reduced cardiovascular risk, and lower rates of death. Unfortunately,
more than 75% of T2D patients do not engage in recommended levels of physical activity. Many existing
physical activity interventions in T2D have had limited effects on activity and diabetes outcomes, and most do
not address psychological factors independently linked with greater activity. Furthermore, physical activity
interventions that do appear to be effective are intensive and have been difficult to implement in clinical
settings. Innovative, accessible interventions to promote physical activity in T2D are badly needed.
 Positive psychology (PP) interventions may represent a novel, effective component of a T2D activity
intervention. Positive psychological well-being (e.g., optimism, positive affect) is prospectively associated with
more physical activity, better glycemic control, and lower cardiac risk. PP interventions use simple exercises
(e.g., using personal strengths, accessing gratitude) to systematically cultivate such well-being. In preliminary
work, PP has led to substantial increases in activity when combined with existing behavior change programs.
 Motivational interviewing (MI) could be another element of a scalable activity intervention in T2D. MI is
a well-established, effective approach to behavior change that can be delivered remotely. However, MI alone
has had somewhat modest effects on activity in T2D, potentially due to low levels of optimism and self-efficacy
in this population that could be addressed by PP. Given their complementary approaches to behavior change,
PP and MI could be combined to promote optimism, self-efficacy, and motivation to engage in physical activity.
 We have developed a remotely delivered, combined PP-MI intervention to promote physical activity in
T2D patients, and in an NIDDK R21 pilot trial (NIH Stage IB; N=60) we found the intervention to be well-
accepted and associated with promising improvements in well-being and physical activity. We now aim to
examine the efficacy of the 16-week PP-MI intervention, with 8 weeks of phone sessions and 16 total weeks of
text messaging to further support change, in a randomized NIH Stage II efficacy trial in 280 patients with T2D
and low baseline physical activity. PP-MI will be compared to a time-matched, MI-alone control condition. The
primary study outcome will be improvement in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) at 16 weeks. We
will also measure the intervention’s impact on overall physical activity, psychological measures, diabetes self-
care, function, cardiac risk factors, and glycemic control at 8, 16, 24, and 52 weeks. Finally, we will assess PP-
MI’s mechanism of effect on MVPA via causal mediation analyses to allow further intervention refinement.
 Through its potential to promote physical activity in T2D, the remotely delivered PP-MI program could
impact public health and clinical practice. If PP-MI shows efficacy in this trial, we will more definitively examine
its effects on glycemic control and cardiac risk in a larger, Stage III effectiveness-based trial."
10850655,"Poverty is associated with harsh living conditions, few opportunities to exercise, and poor access to healthy
food that collectively produce “wear and tear” on organ systems. Psychological stress increases the fragility of
neurons in the central nervous system, potentially producing both the loss of function and volume in areas of
the brain that are involved in maintaining homeostasis (e.g., blood glucose), planning tasks, executing tasks,
motivation, and emotional control. Psychological stress and poor nutrition can accelerate the aging process,
and may manifest as executive function deficits, diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer's disease/Alzheimer's disease-
related dementias (AD/ADRD), and early death. The mechanisms by which poverty-associated stress
accelerates aging are known, but there is no proven intervention to slow the rapid pace of aging among
impoverished families. Anti-poverty programs are a logical point of intervention.
An ongoing randomized-controlled trial (RCT), MyGoals for Employment Success, intervenes on both poverty
using proven employment incentives and on executive function deficits using a field-tested coaching program.
That study was designed to evaluate outcomes associated with executive function, economic well-being, and
social functioning. To evaluate outcomes associated with aging, additional intervention time and follow up are
needed because health outcomes tend to lag economic outcomes.
The National Institute on Aging provided one year of funding for cohort maintenance and to re-design MyGoals
for Employment Success into a healthy aging study with three years of intervention time, six years of follow up,
and health, aging, and cognition measures. This re-design was done in collaboration with leading
interdisciplinary experts using the Delphi method, a formalized process for understanding how to optimize
measure selection and the timing of measure collection. With their input, we propose an innovative RCT that
we call MyGoals for Healthy Aging. We will measure the effect of the intervention on psychological stress, diet,
sleep, mood, loneliness, height, weight, executive function, blood sugar, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and
gene methylation patterns. We will also store blood for future “freezer studies” that allow for more sophisticated
measures of human aging. In addition, we will maintain an ongoing dataset linked to electronic data so that it is
possible to measure outcomes beyond the time frame of the study, including future income and mortality by
cause of death. Completion of these aims will provide foundational evidence on the ability of social policy to
influence aging-related health outcomes; our ultimate goal is to test a novel intervention that might reduce or

10850662,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Intrauterine exposure to maternal overweight/obesity and diabetes transmits risks to offspring, triggering a
disease cycle across generations. Over half of US women have overweight or obesity at conception and ~10%
of pregnancies are affected by diabetes, exposing nearly 2 million infants each year. Prenatal lifestyle
interventions are well-studied, yet begin too late to impact the critical period of conception and early pregnancy.
Starting interventions before conception may be key to halting the disease cycle. However, prior research is
limited, often lacks offspring outcomes (especially sensitive measures), includes mostly white and affluent
participants, and has been challenged to identify women likely to conceive soon. Further research is needed on
scalable strategies to improve maternal-child health during preconception and early pregnancy, especially for
racial and ethnic minority or low-income women with disparately high prevalence of obesity and diabetes. The
National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) is a widely-disseminated lifestyle intervention to reduce weight
and glycemia that has untapped potential to improve maternal-child health. From an implementation science
perspective, the NDPP has greater potential impact than new interventions that are unlikely to be scaled up,
even if efficacious. We have delivered the NDPP to >1600 adults since 2013, including >350 young women. Our
preliminary data shows that the NDPP may reduce peri-conceptional risks in diverse, low-income women. While
limited engagement by younger women in the NDPP is a concern, strategies to increase engagement
(motivational “pre-sessions”, remote delivery, and classes specially for young women) are promising. For
example, young women attended our 12-month NDPP for 64 days longer after receiving a pre-session, with 2.0
kg/m2 lower preconception BMI and 0.4% lower A1c in early pregnancy, than controls. To plan a preconception
trial, we also developed a 2-step screening protocol to 1) use electronic health record data (e.g., contraceptive
use) to identify women who are more likely to conceive by 24 months (36% vs. 13% for all young women), and
2) outreach to confirm current family planning to expect ≥60% conception, based on our preliminary data showing
that 73% conceived by 24 months if they endorsed intention to conceive or being sexual active without highly
effective contraception. We propose a randomized controlled trial of an enhanced NDPP (NDPP-NextGen)
initiated before pregnancy to evaluate effects on maternal-child health. We will recruit 360 women aged 18-39
years with overweight/obesity who are likely to conceive within 24 months. Women will be randomized to NDPP-
NextGen or a usual care control group. Our specific aims are 1) to assess effects of NDPP-NextGen on peri-
conceptional BMI and prenatal glycemia; 2) to assess effects of NDPP-NextGen on gestational weight gain and
behavioral outcomes in pregnancy; and 3) to explore effects of NDPP-NextGen on neonatal adiposity and
explanatory mechanisms."

understanding of the experiences of persons with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and AD-related dementias
(ADRD), their care partners and older adults (co-mentor: Edith Burns, MD); 2) gain expertise in theoretical
models of loneliness (team member: Louise Hawkley, PhD); 3) advance my understanding of psychotherapies
(team member: Allison Applebaum, PhD); 4) leveraging technology to deliver interventions (primary mentor:
Michael Diefenbach, PhD); 5) learning advanced study designs, methodologies, and statistics (co-mentor:
Martin Lesser, PhD); and 6) engage in in-depth training needed to maintain a successful program of research
(Diefenbach). These training goals and expert mentorship were designed in support of my overall career goal
of becoming an independent investigator improving the lives of older adults and their care partners through
reduction of loneliness. More than 60% of care partners of persons with AD/ADRD report feeling lonely.
Building on the existing evidence that increasing meaning and purpose in life is a strong predictor of decreased
loneliness, interventions to reduce loneliness in this population may be strengthened by incorporating concepts
from Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy (MCP). Thus, the overall goal of the proposed project is to reduce
loneliness in care partners of patients with AD/ADRD through increasing their sense of meaning and purpose
in life using concepts from MCP, delivered via a web-based platform, RELOAD-C (REducing LOneliness in
Alzeheimer’s Disease-Care Partners). This will be achieved through three Specific Aims. Aim 1 consists of
three phases (preparatory work, stakeholder involvement with N=15 AD/ADRD care partners, and adaptation
of the existing web-based platform) to produce RELOAD-C, which centralizes: 1) 6 brief videos portraying our
MCP expert delivering MCP concepts; 2) links to 7 virtual group meetings (6 weekly + 1 booster) to discuss
MCP concepts; and 3) written content expanding on the material from the MCP videos. Aim 2 evaluates
usability/acceptability of RELOAD-C (defined as a task success rate ≥ 78%, and scores ≥ 68 on the System
Usability Scale) with N=20 care partners of persons with AD/ADRD. Aim 3 proposes a pilot RCT to evaluate
the preliminary efficacy of the RELOAD-C components (MCP videos vs. MCP-focused group discussions) in
reducing loneliness and feasibility of conducting a future, large-scale RCT. N=96 AD/ADRD care partners will
be randomized to: usual care, n=32; MCP videos alone via RELOAD-C, n=32; or MCP videos + weekly groups
via RELOAD-C, n=32. Care partners’ outcomes will be assessed at baseline, and 6-weeks and 3-months post-
baseline. We expect the effect sizes will be in the moderate range (.3). Feasibility is defined as: ≥ 75%
consented, ≤ 30% drop-out, and 80% engagement with intervention. Reducing loneliness among care partners

Microtubules are long, dynamic filaments made of tubulin protein which physically organize most human cells,
with prominent roles in cell division and neurons. We will investigate the cell- and chemical biology of
microtubules using microscopy, biochemistry and genetics. We seek to answer fundamental questions about
microtubule organization and function and to generate knowledge relevant to treating human diseases where
microtubules play a role. We will analyze the physical mechanisms cells use to divide using frog eggs
(Xenopus) as a model system. A key unanswered question is how different components of the cell interact
mechanically to promote accurate division. This work will help us understand mistakes in cell division that
give rise to birth defects and cancer. We will image individual growing microtubules in cells and frog egg
extracts and measure sideways movement of growing tips, which will reveal previously hidden physical forces
that act on them and help us understand microtubule organization. We are interested in developing drugs
that perturb mitosis in certain cancers but normal cells, which may open new avenues to treatment. We will
target a kinase called VRK1, which is selectively essential for mitosis in glioblastomas. We are interested in
how microtubules become damaged in disease states such as inflammation, cancer and neurodegeneration.
We hypothesis that tubulin is chemically damaged by reactive fragments of cellular lipids and that Stathmin-
1 protein protects cells by sequestering damaged tubulin. We will test this idea using biochemistry and
microscopy of cultured cells and de-identified human disease biopsies. A related protein called Stathmin-2
protects the health of motor neurons and its loss can cause ALS. We will analyze how sthamin-2 protects
neurons, hoping to generate knowledge relevant to disease-modifying treatments of ALS."

Radical SAM is the largest enzyme superfamily known, with its members catalyzing a remarkable diversity
of reactions in all domains of life. Radical SAM enzymes are involved in the synthesis of essential cofactors
and antibiotics, repair of DNA damage, and the assembly of complex biological metal clusters, among
many other reactions. The presence of radical SAM enzymes in humans as well as in both beneficial and
pathogenic microbes lends high significance to understanding their fundamental properties and
mechanisms. The proposed research will develop a critical understanding of radical SAM mechanisms,
including both the radical initiation process common to all enzymes in this large and diverse superfamily,
and mechanisms of individual radical SAM enzymes. Research efforts will focus on freeze-quench trapping
radical intermediates and using time-delay, thermal annealing, and photo-initiation to probe reaction steps
and chemical properties. Trapped intermediates will be characterized by using spectroscopic approaches
such as electron paramagnetic resonance and electron-nuclear double resonance, and structural approaches
such as X-ray crystallography. Systems to be studied will include the pyruvate formate-lyase activating
enzyme, which has proven to be an outstanding prototypical radical SAM enzyme for illuminating
mechanistic details. In addition, we will pursue mechanistic insights into radical SAM enzymes involved
in maturation of RiPPs (ribosomally-encoded, post-translationally modified peptides) and larger protein
substrates undergoing substantial modification. We will further be working to define the biochemical
function of RSAD1, a radical SAM enzyme implicated in Alzheimer’s disease in humans. This project will
provide new insights into the fundamental mechanisms of radical initiation in radical SAM enzymes, and
into the mechanistic and functional details of some of the more complex and interesting reactions catalyzed
by members of this enzyme superfamily."

Both the DNA genome and the RNA transcriptome are punctuated with chemical modifications
to the four bases, and these modifications can either be added to individual nucleotides by
specific enzymes or installed by cellular chemistry, such as oxidative stress. This program
seeks to understand where these base modifications occur by developing new chemical
methods of sequencing for modifications as well as examining the biological outcomes of such
modifications through biochemical studies of the proteins that write, read and erase the
chemical modifications. Previous NIH support of this program led to the discovery of oxidized
guanine nucleotides as epigenetic-like modifications in G-quadruplexes of gene promoters as
well as sequencing methods to characterize oxidation in the genome and base modifications in
the transcriptome. Future work will study the key DNA repair proteins, apurinic/apyrimidinic
endonuclease-1 (APE1), oxidized guanine glycosylase 1 (OGG1), endonuclease VIII-like protein
1 (NEIL1) and Cockayne syndrome B (CSB) protein by biophysical methods to understand the
mechanism of gene regulation. For both DNA and RNA, nanopore sequencing methods will be
advanced for detection of oxidized bases as well as the two most common base modifications in
RNA, pseudouridine and N6-methyladenosine. These unusual bases are found to be more
abundant in cells undergoing oxidative or inflammatory stress and viral infection."

Messenger RNA transmits genetic information from DNA to protein. The regulation of mRNA
levels is a fine balance between transcription rate and degradation rate. Transcriptional control
is well documented and studied. Although the major pathways in mRNA turnover have been
identified, accounting for disparate half-lives has been elusive. My lab has shown that codon
optimality is a general feature that contributes greatly to mRNA stability in eukaryotes. Codon
optimality reflects the disproportionate rate by which the ribosome deciphers each of the 61
codons. The randomness of tRNA selection during the mRNA decoding process manifests in
codon optimality wherein tRNA concentrations/functionality dramatically influence rate.
Accordingly, codon optimality is ultimately gauged by the relative prevalence of cognate tRNAs,
wherein a codon is deemed `optimal' when tRNAs are in excess and conversely `non-optimal'
when tRNAs are more limiting. Codon optimality is also determined by the thermodynamic
stability of codon/anticodon pairing. Our major advance has been to show that the mRNA
degradation machinery monitors ribosome speed and responds to degrade message when
ribosome movement is relatively slow. In this proposal, we investigate how the mRNA
degradation complex senses ribosome translocation rate as a function of codon optimality. We
will determine the precise molecular events that occur in response to ribosome hesitations.
Moreover, we focus on biological context where codon optimality is regulated both through
mRNA chemical modification and tRNA regulated expression. Lastly the influence of codon
optimality is now seen to be the major determinant of mRNA stability in yeast and in early
development. Thus work through this project has uncovered a central and critical principle in
biology that contributes broadly to gene expression regulation."

 The small Ca binding protein, calmodulin (CaM), either directly controls, or at minimum, modulates every
functionality within the heart. This versatile and ubiquitous Ca binding protein is the only known exception to the
central rule of biology - one gene one protein. In all mammalian cells, an identical CaM protein is derived from
three different genes, CaM1,2 and 3. Finding the reason for this deviation is not only important to explain this
biological conundrum, but for understanding the vast signaling processes mediated by CaM in various cell types
including cardiac myocytes in health and disease. CaM is known to bind and regulate hundreds of target proteins.
Due to the fact that the free concentration of CaM is limited within cardiac myocytes, yet the bound protein is
abundant, we surmise the presence of the three different genes is important for orchestrating specific and unique
myocyte CaM-mediated Ca signaling processes in space and time. We propose the divergent 5’ and 3’ UTRs
of the three CaM genes recruit different RNA binding proteins used to transport and pool together specific CaM
target proteins’ mRNAs into discrete “interactosomes”. We hypothesize these mRNA clusters are then locally
translated together (“tranlatosomes”) where the proteins function within the cardiac myocyte and are thus
“functionally distributed”. We have created novel imaging tools and data analysis software in order to visualize
these processes. We have also discovered in the adult cardiac myocyte that ribosomal translocons, rough ER,
and the golgi complex actively process and translate transmembrane proteins far from the perinuclear space,
contradictory to the long held classical view of membrane protein translation. In this proposal, we will define the
abundance, subcellular distribution, sites of translation and physiological modulation for the three CaM mRNAs,
along with key CaM targets in cardiac myocytes in health and disease. Ultimately, we will apply this novel and
new knowledge to target our therapeutically engineered proteins with high precision and specificity to select
“interactosomes” in order to treat various cardiovascular diseases."
10838523,"Key steps of early HIV-1 infection include reverse transcription, nuclear import of replication complexes and
transport to nuclear speckles followed by viral DNA integration into host genome. At some point before
integration, the capsid shell surrounding the viral ribonucleoprotein complex must disassemble (uncoat) to
release the viral pre-integration complexes. It is currently unclear where in the cell uncoating occurs and whether
the capsid (CA) protein is progressively or synchronously lost from the capsid shell, yet optimal core stability is
essential for evading the host innate immune responses and for nuclear import of functional viral complexes.
Highly divergent findings regarding HIV-1 uncoating have been reported by several groups based upon the
visualization of single virus uncoating in live cells. These conflicting results stem, in part, from the use of indirect
CA labeling approaches and lack of minimally invasive direct fluorescent labeling of HIV-1 capsid. We
hypothesize that HIV-1 uncoating is a multi-step process that involves permeabilization of the capsid shell in the
cytoplasm, remodeling at the nuclear pore, and loss of CA in the nucleus. We will use a novel minimally invasive
direct CA labeling strategy, which is based on site-directed incorporation of non-canonical amino acids and click-
labeling with an organic dye, to elucidate single HIV-1 core permeabilization and uncoating events resulting to
infection (Aim 1). Another gap in knowledge pertains to post-uncoating processes leading to HIV-1 integration
and sub-nuclear compartments where integration occurs. We hypothesize that the viral pre-integration complex
separates from the capsid shell and travels to the edge of a nuclear speckle where it engages the integrase-
binding host factor LEDGF/p75 for integration into host genome. We will employ a novel live-cell single viral DNA
visualization technology to track nuclear transport and productive integration of single viral complexes that
establish actively transcribing viral RNA foci (Aim 2). Finally, we will use a powerful panel of biochemical,
biophysical, structural biology, virology, and microscopy techniques to characterize a novel HIV-1 CA binding
host factor, RBM14, which we hypothesize to modulate pre-integration steps of infection after nuclear import
(Aim 3). These experiments are expected to elucidate the controversial HIV-1 uncoating process, reveal the
dynamic events leading to productive integration and sites of integration, as well as delineate the role of RBM14-
capsid interactions in early infection, thus informing novel antiviral strategies."

The healthy corneal epithelium is an effective barrier to pathogenic and environmental bacteria. Because of
this, corneal infection or keratitis models often rely on bypassing the epithelium altogether by introducing
microbes directly into the corneal stroma, where they initiate immune cell responses that can damage tissue
and cause vision-threatening scarring. A limitation of this experimental approach is that epithelial defense
mechanisms are unable to be identified or investigated. The bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is
the most common infection associated with soft contact lens wear, suggesting it is uniquely capable of causing
infection in the stroma even when the epithelium remains intact. One way in which P. aeruginosa colonizes the
epithelium is by invading and replicating inside epithelial cells, which has been investigated in cultured cells,
and observed in mouse corneal infection models. Preliminary data show that the toxin ExoS produced by P.
aeruginosa suppresses caspase-4 mediated pyroptosis of invaded corneal epithelial cells, buying time for
bacteria to replicate in a protected niche. Additional data indicate that a different inflammasome pathway is
also active in corneal epithelial cells, and leads to production of the cytokine IL-1β, which ExoS also
suppresses. Therefore, a novel role for ExoS in corneal infection could be to prolong a niche for bacteria to
replicate within corneal epithelial cells, while limiting secretion of cytokines that recruit immune cells. Using
imaging methods to selectively monitor invaded cells, and CRISPR-Cas9 to manipulate corneal epithelial cells
genetically, we will answer three outstanding questions regarding both corneal epithelial defense, and bacterial
subversion of it: 1. How does ExoS block caspase-4-mediated pyroptosis? 2. How do corneal epithelial cells
detect and respond to P. aeruginosa? 3. What is the significance of epithelial cell inflammasome activation and
pyroptosis in protecting the eye from developing keratitis in the stroma? Successful completion of these aims
will identify a new mechanism of host defense at the ocular surface, further our understanding of
inflammasomes in epithelial cells, and elucidate how a uniquely devastating corneal pathogen is able to
overcome host defenses."
10828832,"In response to RFA AI-19-036, investigators from Rutgers University, Makerere University, the Foundation for
Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), McGill University, Frontier Sciences Boston, the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, the Kenyan Medical Research Institute and Oxford University propose to study Novel
and Optimized Diagnostics (NOD) for Pediatric TB in a prospective study of well-characterized cohorts of children
<5 years of age in Uganda and by accessing the biorepository from a pediatric diagnostic study in Kenya. The
study populations are enriched for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and HIV-exposed, uninfected
(HEU) children. The major advances in the diagnosis of adult tuberculosis (TB) have not extended to pediatric
TB. There are several reasons for this. Most children in high burden countries with symptoms compatible with
TB have limited access to clinical and laboratory facilities necessary for the diagnosis. Even at referral centers
where diagnosis is feasible, because of the paucibacillary nature of pediatric TB only a small proportion of
children that have a compatible clinical presentation can be bacteriologically confirmed. The current bacteriologic
reference standard for TB diagnosis requires difficult to obtain respiratory samples and has limited sensitivity.
The impact of HIV infection of and HIV-exposure on diagnostic accuracy is uncertain. Under- and misdiagnosis
of pediatric TB contributes to the high case-fatality rates that are highest in children <5 years of age and in those
with HIV infection. The novel approaches for TB diagnosis in children < 5 year of age that we propose address
the current needs: a) Point-of-care (POC) tests that avoid collections of respiratory specimens; b) increasing the
proportion of bacteriologically-confirmed cases with more sensitive diagnostics; and, c) stratification of children
with unconfirmed TB by their likelihood of having TB. We hypothesize that novel diagnostics that are currently
available or further optimized and new diagnostics based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) of cell free DNA
can address each of these needs. We will accomplish these goals in 3 specific aims: 1. Evaluate and develop
novel assays that diagnose TB by detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacterial products in non-sputum
body fluids comparing highly characterized children with microbiologically confirmed TB versus children
suspected but deemed unlikely to have TB (unlikely TB). 2. Evaluate and develop novel assays that diagnose
TB by detecting host biomarkers in non-sputum body fluids comparing children with confirmed TB versus unlikely
TB. 3. Identify combinations of assays that applied together could be used to diagnose TB among children
suspected of having TB but that are culture negative (unconfirmed TB). We will propose a new reference
standard for the diagnosis of TB that might contain host and bacteria-based assays. Once validated in large
observational studies and clinical trials, it could allow targeting of TB treatment in children currently classified as
unconfirmed."
10828835,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a global epidemic, progresses to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
and fibrosis, and results in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma and increased cardiovascular mortality.
Unfortunately, no pharmacological therapies are available yet to treat NASH and fibrosis, necessitating the
identification of novel targets and approaches. RECK (Reversion Inducing Cysteine Rich Protein with Kazal
Motifs), a unique membrane-anchored protein, has been shown to inhibit multiple mediators involved in
inflammation and fibrosis. Our novel preliminary data demonstrate that hepatic RECK protein levels are markedly
reduced with increasing severity of NASH and fibrosis in clinical patients and in our pre-clinical mouse model of
western diet (WD)-induced NASH and fibrosis. Since RECK gene deletion is embryonically lethal, we generated
RECK floxed (RECKfl/fl) and CAG-CATflox-RECK transgenic mice. Our proof-of-concept pilot studies demonstrate
that while hepatocyte-specific RECK knockdown by AAV8-mediated Cre recombinase exacerbates NASH and
fibrosis in short-term WD-fed mice, its overexpression in hepatocytes blunts liver inflammation, Kupffer cells (KC)
and hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation. Moreover, our preliminary in vitro data in primary mouse hepatocytes,
KCs and HSCs in which RECK is either silenced or overexpressed support our in vivo studies. These preliminary
studies suggest that sustaining RECK expression is hepatoprotective. Therefore, we hypothesize that Cre-Lox
mediated RECK deletion specifically in hepatocytes enhances pro-inflammatory signaling by enhancing
amphiregulin (AREG) cleavage by ADAM (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase domain-containing protein) 10-
and 17, leading to increased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HSC activation collectively
contributing to worsening of long-term WD-induced NASH and fibrosis (Aim 1). Conversely, transgenic
overexpression of RECK, specifically in hepatocytes, will be protective. We will also determine if rescuing RECK
expression by ectopic overexpression in hepatocyte-specific RECK deficient mice with established WD-induced
NASH and fibrosis can be reversed (Aim 1). Since KCs are the predominant resident liver macrophages and
HSCs are considered the principal cell type responsible for hepatic fibrosis, we will establish the importance of
RECK deletion and transgenic overexpression in Kupffer cells and HSCs on cellular injury and activation,
extracellular matrix deposition, and fibrosis (Aim 2). In both Aims, molecular mechanisms underlying
inflammation and fibrosis will be investigated in co-culture studies using primary hepatocytes, KCs and HSCs
isolated from these gene-altered mouse models. Thus, our proposed genetic and interventional approaches will
mechanistically establish RECK as a novel upstream regulator in the pathogenesis of both NASH and fibrosis
with potential as a future therapeutic."

Given the complex challenges of developing preventative measures and novel treatments for disease and
improving health, we see an imperative to train the next generation of translational researchers in an
interdisciplinary environment. The Institute of Translational Health Sciences (ITHS)—a partnership between the
University of Washington, Seattle Children's, and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center—is an incredibly
rich environment for clinical and translational research and attracts PhD, MD and other clinically trained
investigators. The reach of ITHS extends beyond its hub in Seattle across Washington, Wyoming, Alaska,
Montana, and Idaho (WWAMI), providing distinct opportunities, particularly in the areas of rural health and
underserved populations, through clinical research networks and collaborating universities. Since 2007, the ITHS
KL2 Multidisciplinary Career Development Program has cultivated a group of talented junior faculty from a wide
variety of disciplines. The primary goal of the 3-year program is to prepare a diverse group of early career faculty
to lead interdisciplinary teams conducting translational research that will ultimately improve human health. ITHS
provides salary and research funds, protected time, and mentorship to 9 scholars each year. The 62 scholars
trained to date produced 458 publications while in the program and have been awarded more than $73M in NIH
funding. ITHS now proposes to enhance the existing KL2 program through two new major aims to:
1. Create a larger, more inclusive cohort to promote scholar engagement through the addition of an
 institutionally supported KL2 seminar fellows program. We will maintain 13-15 seminar fellows per year,
 early career investigators who participate fully in the KL2 curriculum for up to 2 years but are supported by
 other funds. The larger cohort will enrich the KL2 experience for funded scholars by providing more
 opportunities for peer engagement and adding more diverse research perspectives, as well as those from
 different cultural and social backgrounds, which have a positive impact on innovation.
2. Increase the diversity of the KL2 cohort to support more scientists from underrepresented
 backgrounds on the basis of race/ethnicity, disability, and social disadvantage, and from regional
 research organizations. We will expand outreach, purposeful recruitment, and pre-application support to
 draw more investigators from outside the 3 Seattle-based partners and investigators from groups identified
 by NIH as underrepresented in biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and social sciences. Centering this as a major
 aim will help us create a more diverse translational research workforce.
KL2 scholars and seminar fellows will be rigorously trained using a curriculum grounded in translational science
core competencies in a unique interdisciplinary environment. Scholars benefit from guidance of their scientific
mentors and KL2 Program Directors. Graduates will be positioned to lead effective research teams that work
across disciplinary boundaries, making a positive impact on human health, and reaching a range of communities."
10828709,"Over 2.5 million U.S. service members have been deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq war zones since 2002 and,
according to reports from the Department of Veterans Affairs, one in every six returns from this OEF/OIF arena
with PTSD. Since only half of the Veterans with PTSD response to treatment, alternate treatment approaches
need to be explored. PTSD consists not only clusters of clinical symptoms, but also immune imbalances
toward an inflammatory state. Studies of humans and with animal models have shown that peripheral
inflammation can stimulate neuroinflammation and, in turn, alter behavior. Added studies have suggested
immune contributions to PTSD following trauma. However, immune analyses with PTSD subjects have been
haphazard and studies have not considered the possibility of restoring peripheral immune balance to lessen
neuroinflammation as a novel immunotherapeutic approach for PTSD.
The hypothesis of the present study is that the dysregulated immune state in PTSD parallels disease status,
and can contribute to inflammatory brain cell reactivity. Also hypothesized is that leukocytes from subjects with
PTSD can be redirected from a hyper-inflammatory state toward a balanced regulated state, thus quenching
their ability to stimulate brain cell inflammatory activity.
Rationale: While the present study does not propose inflammation to be the primary cause of PTSD, there is
support for a causative linkage between inflammation and PTSD following trauma exposure. Several studies
with human subjects showed that stimulation of peripheral inflammation results in activation of brain microglia,
hypervigilence, irritability and anxiety. If inflammation-skewed leukocytes of PTSD subjects still retain
plasticity, then then there is the opportunity for immune redirection to a functionally balanced state that does
not facilitate brain cell inflammatory activity. The following specific aims will test the hypothesis of this study:
Aim #1: Define the immune imbalances in PTSD and demonstrate that the dysregulated immune state of
 PTSD subjects parallels disease status.
Aim #2: Identify the heightened microglial-activating capacity of leukocytes of PTSD subjects.
Aim #3: Redirect inflammation-skewed blood leukocytes from subjects with PTSD to a balanced state.
Aim #4: Determine if redirecting the inflammation-skewed blood leukocytes of subjects with PTSD to a
 balanced state blocks their microglial-activating ability.
To limit the influence of variables, this study will involve a tightly-controlled and relatively homogeneous
population of Veterans, all with similar levels of combat exposure in the OEF/OIF arena, but some with PTSD
and others testing negative for PTSD. The proposed studies are expected to show immunological imbalance
toward an inflammatory phenotype in PTSD patients and that this imbalanced status stimulates microglial
inflammatory activity. Important for the goal of developing immunotherapeutic approaches for PTSD is
assessment of immune plasticity to determine if leukocytes of PTSD subjects can be redirected from an
inflammatory to a balanced regulated state with diminished microglial-activating capacity.
Significance to Veterans’ health: Despite the availability of psychological and pharmacological treatments
for PTSD, about half of combat Veterans remain unresponsive to these treatments. Since peripheral
inflammation can impact on brain inflammation and behavior, our study to define the peripheral immune impact
on brain microglial inflammatory reactivity, as well as to explore the feasibility of redirecting the immune
imbalances will pave the way for a novel immunotherapeutic approaches for PTSD. Consistent with the VHA
Blueprint for Excellence for “improving Veteran health and well-being, and developing novel treatment of health
issues that are unique to Veterans”, this study’s goal is to expand a much-needed armament of treatment
approaches for Veterans with PTSD."

 Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a congenital heart disease with a high mortality rate. Infants with
this syndrome are born with circulation problems due to hypoplasia of the left part of the heart that includes
aorta, left ventricle, mitral valve and aortic valve. Infants may need to undergo a series of open-heart surgeries
to restore systemic circulation. Even after the surgeries, these patients can develop heart failure and other
complications due to the overload on the right ventricle that serves as the single ventricle. Very little is known
about the etiology and pathogenic mechanisms of HLHS. Recent human genetic studies identified de novo
loss of function mutations in the RNA binding protein RBFOX2 that are linked to the HLHS phenotype. It is
currently unknown how RBFOX2 contributes to HLHS developmental defects. This is mainly because of our
lack of knowledge regarding the role of RBFOX2 in cardiovascular development and its target RNAs in the
embryonic heart. Using our Rbfox2 conditional knockout mouse model, which recapitulates several phenotypic,
cellular, and molecular features of HLHS, we will address these urgent and clinically relevant questions utilizing
genetic, molecular/cellular and state-of-the art custom designed sequencing and computational approaches.
Our main goal is to determine the mechanisms by which RBFOX2-regulated RNA networks contribute to
cardiovascular development and investigate their contributions to HLHS. Our work will determine the
underlying mechanisms of HLHS developmental defects caused by loss of RBFOX2. Ultimately, our findings
will advance development of innovative HLHS therapeutic strategies by restoring aberrant RBFOX2-regulated
gene expression in HLHS patients using modified antisense oligonucleotides in the future."

22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS), the most common of the microdeletion syndromes, is caused by
hemizygous loss of 0.7-3 Mb of DNA on chromosome 22 and results in a constellation of clinical phenotypes.
The core phenotype originates from disrupted development of the pharyngeal apparatus. Particularly affected
are the second heart field-dependent heart structures, great vessels, parathyroids, thymus, and lower
craniofacial and face muscles. Although approximately 50 genes may be deleted, it is the haploinsufficiency of
the transcription factor TBX1 that recapitulates most of the critical phenotype associated with 22q11.2DS.
Genetic and developmental mouse studies have established that TBX1 is critical for typical development of the
pharyngeal endoderm, a transient anatomical structure necessary for development of the thymus, parathyroids,
and 4th pharyngeal arch arteries. Despite this central role, very little is known regarding the molecular
mechanisms by which TBX1 functions in the pharyngeal endoderm. While a handful of studies have attempted
to study the role of TBX1 in human cells, the cell types they have been conducted in are not representative of
the appropriate developmental stage where and when TBX1 plays its critical role. To date, an effort to integrate
all the critical genes into a pharyngeal endoderm or 4th pharyngeal arch arteries network has not been attempted,
particularly in human cells.
This R01 leverages recent development of an in vitro model which faithfully mimics the formation and progression
of human pharyngeal endoderm, thereby providing an unprecedented opportunity to tease out the functions of
TBX1 in its physiological context. Specifically, this model will be used to identify the transcriptional targets and
partners of TBX1 (Aim1), investigate the role of TBX1 as epigenetic regulator of the human pharyngeal endoderm
(Aim2), and mechanistically investigate newly discovered putative regulatory regions of the TBX1 locus (Aim3).
The overarching hypothesis is that TBX1 is at the center of a Gene Regulatory Network critical for both the
formation and maturation of the pharyngeal endoderm and the morpho-patterning of the surrounding mesoderm
and neural crest cells.
The proposed work is expected to identify the molecular mechanism at the basis of TBX1 haploinsufficiency and
identify pathways which could be rescued through pharmacological intervention. Dissection of the epigenetic
and molecular machinery responsible for pharyngeal endoderm formation will be instrumental in informing the
generation of cell therapies for 22q11.2DS."

and basic science. The purpose of our Program is to train young scientists and physician-scientists in basic
and translational research, in the diverse lines of investigation related to transplantation biology, in this multi-
disciplinary environment, with emphases on immunological mechanisms with translational applications.
Participating faculty members with diverse but complementary research interests, a successful record of
collaboration, and a commitment to training young investigators, have been assembled to provide trainees with
exposure to topics related to transplantation immunobiology including immunogenetics, tolerance induction,
antigen processing and presentation, bone marrow transplantation, regulation of lymphocyte development,
pathology of graft rejection, complement biology, autoimmune disease, dendritic cell biology, chemokines and
lymphocyte trafficking, B and T cell biology, regulatory T cells, mucosal immunology, gene editing, infection,
cancer biology, and xenotransplantation. The major goal of this program is to develop outstanding
independent investigators capable of addressing fundamental questions in the field of transplantation
and the application of this knowledge to important clinical challenges. Pre-doctoral trainees will be
selected from students currently enrolled in the Immunology Program at Harvard University's Division of
Medical Sciences with an interest in pursuing thesis research in the field of transplantation immunology.
Training for pre-doctoral students takes approximately 5 years, and students commit to thesis laboratories in
the second year of graduate school. Pre-doctoral trainees already in transplantation-related research
laboratories and distributed between students in their 3rd, 4th or 5th year of thesis research will be selected.
Post-doctoral trainees currently holding a degree of MD, PhD, or MD/PhD will be selected with outstanding
potential for careers in research and teaching and a commitment to independent investigation. Training will
require 2-3 years. This program builds on our unique and dynamic environment to optimize individual training
and mentorship experiences, by expanding into new areas of research, by recruitment of trainees and faculty
from groups underrepresented in transplant research, to advance excellence in the field of transplantation."

biomarker profiles for clinical applications. Finally, with this foundation, cannabinoid-associated extracellular

Droplet-based single cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology is able to measure the gene
expression from tens of thousands of single cells simultaneously. More recently, coupled with cutting-edge
Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq) and Cell Hashing technology,
the droplet-based system has allowed for immunophenotyping of single cells based on cell surface expression
of specific proteins together with simultaneous transcriptome profiling in the same cell. These cutting-edge
technologies have transformed biomedical research. The proposed two projects in this P01 renewal will apply
these single-cell genomics tools to further characterize the molecular signature of severe asthma patients and
advance our knowledge of underlying pathobiological characteristics. Bioinformatics and sequencing Core C
will provide full support to both projects with the knowledge from the best single cell experiment and
bioinformatics practice in the field. With the similar responsibility of Core C in the previous cycle, our core will
continue providing high-quality services of cutting-edge single cell experiments and advanced bioinformatics
analysis. In addition to classic analysis, Core C will develop new computational tools to analyze single-cell
multi-omics data and integrate multi-modal data with clinical phenotypes from both projects. Specifically, the
aims of our team are to: (1) perform bulk RNA-seq, TCR-seq, scRNA-seq and CITE-seq experiments, (2)
perform data processing and advanced bioinformatic analysis of multi-omics data, and (3) develop novel and
tailored computational methods for integrative analysis of multi-omics single cell data. To achieve our goals,
we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with outstanding expertise in asthma research, single-cell
technology, bioinformatics, and computational immunology. Our pioneering work should generate precious
genomics data, enhance our understanding of asthma pathogenesis, and provide new biological insights to
prevent, diagnose, and treat severe asthma."
10829841,"Despite many advancements in the treatment of severe asthma (SA) with the advent of biologics, there still
remain challenges because of incomplete understanding of the underlying immune and molecular aberrations.
Towards this end, we analyzed the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells of patients enrolled in the severe
asthma research program (SARP) and also of those in the P01-funded IMSA (Immune Mechanisms in Severe
Asthma) program. In addition, we studied the transcriptome of these cells using bulk RNA-seq methods. Initial
studies of the SARP cohort revealed that the BAL cells in 35-40% of SA patients harbor a high Type 1
(T1)/IFN-g immune signature and implicated IFN-g-activated STAT1 in steroid insensitivity due to co-operation
with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Subjecting the BAL cells of 41 subjects in the IMSA cohort to mass
cytometry/CyTOF and downstream bioinformatic analysis allowed clustering of the SA patients into two groups
(PGs), PG2 and PG3, displaying distinct immune profiles. The PG2 group showed a heightened innate
immune response dominated by FceRI+IL-4+ cells while PG3 was a lymphocyte-dominated group
characterized by increased numbers of IFN-g+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which included tissue-resident memory
(TRM) cells. The immune cells were associated with gene modules by deconvolution of their transcriptomic
data using our novel algorithm, ICLite. Module-associated gene expression suggests importance of FceRI- and
IL-7-signaling in cytokine production by innate cells in PG2 and of co-stimulatory molecules in positive
regulation of IFN-g production from TRMs in PG3. In the clinic, response to treatment of SA patients with the
biologic, dupilumab, also highlights heterogeneity despite similar biomarker profiles of the treated patients.
Thus, given the novel insight gained about distinct immune phenotypes of SA patients with specific
transcriptomic signatures, we now have the opportunity to determine in fine resolution, immunologically and
molecularly, how dupilumab differentially impacts the local immune (Proj. 1) and epithelial (Proj. 2) phenotypes
in patients who show similar biomarker profiles and yet do not respond similarly to treatment. Collectively,
these data allow us to hypothesize that two distinct immune mechanisms, one regulated by FceRI+ innate
immune cells in conjunction with airway epithelial cells, and the second by T cells, with their impact on
epithelial cells, collectively determines SA. To address this hypothesis, the specific aims of Project 1 are to:
Aim 1. Characterize airway immune cells in high-resolution by CITE-seq and TCR-seq and determine impact
of dupilumab on immune phenotype. Aim 2. Determine mechanisms that induce innate immune cell-driven SA
phenotype using a novel fungal protease-driven model. Aim 3. Determine mechanisms that regulate a T1high
adaptive immune response using an established HDM+cyclic dinucleotide-driven model. Collectively, the
findings will qualify heterogeneity in immune response and response to therapy at the single cell level and
establish key molecules/pathways that drive distinct immune phenotypes using novel experimental models."
10829842,"Project 2 explores the paradigm-shifting hypothesis that the epithelium is at the heart of two
fundamentally different molecular phenotypes of severe asthma (SA). In the 1st, bronchial
epithelial cells (BEC)s respond to initial environmental stimuli to drive an innate intrinsic
phenotype. In the 2nd, BEC cell death pathways intersect with CD8 T-cell immune processes to
drive an immune interactive phenotype. This hypothesis is based on published, submitted and
preliminary data across Project 1 and Project 2 which identify two immune cell phenotypes of
severe asthma, one independent of T-cells and another, highly associated with them, in particular
with CD8 cells. Similar levels of Type-2 (T2) biomarkers/genes are present in both. In published
data from the previous cycle, epithelial growth and repair modules more strongly associated with
asthma severity than T2 modules, suggesting T2 immunity alone does not drive severity.
Consistent with gene expression, poor wound repair of asthmatic BECs in vitro was reported,
with associated loss of a proliferative capacity. The tethered mucin MUC4b, increased in asthma,
lowers BEC proliferation, while increasing secretion. BEC gene clustering mirrors Project 1 with
T-cell- and non-T-cell associated SA phenotypes, each with similar levels of T2 biomarkers. The
innate intrinsic/Non-T-cell SA cluster associates with innate NF-kB and apoptotic pathways
potentially through Toll like receptors (TLR)s. The immune interactive/CD8 cluster associates
with IL-12 and -18, interferons and upregulation of inflammasome and pyroptosis pathways
through the 17q12-21 gene, GSDMB. Thus, interactions between BEC genetic/epigenetic risks,
innate and adaptive immunity and cell death pathways may contribute to these distinct
phenotypes, with differing treatment responses. Using cutting edge technologies of scRNAseq,
advanced bioinformatics and mechanistic in vitro and in vivo models, we will refine the molecular
phenotypes identified in the 1st cycle and link them with cell profiles identified in Project 1. We
propose 3 aims: 1) Identify the mechanisms for and functional implications of an innate intrinsic
epithelial phenotype using fresh and cultured healthy and asthmatic BECs 2) Evaluate the role
of GSDMB in the development of a IL-18/CD8-associated immune interactive phenotype and
its functional implications using fresh and cultured healthy and asthmatic BECs 3) Integrate
immune-inflammatory phenotypes with epithelial molecular phenotypes, as the penultimate effort
to link cell types, mechanisms and compartments to rigorously refine phenotypes. These studies
will improve the understanding of molecular phenotypes in relation to cell death, allowing
Identification of novel precision therapeutic targets to eventually confirm underlying endotypes."
10829926,"ABSTRACT- CLINICAL CORE
The Clinical Core (CC) is central to the function of the NYU ADRC by providing comprehensive evaluations and
accurate research diagnoses for participants engaged in its long-standing longitudinal study of normal versus
pathologic cognitive aging. The CC has made significant advances in the characterization of preclinical to
dementia stages: establishing subjective cognitive decline as a prodromal stage, developing widely used scales
for clinical phenotyping, and helping establish important imaging biomarkers of early stage disease. We continue
our goal to understand mechanisms that influence transitions towards dementia. We emphasize the study of
critical, early transitions (normal->preclinical/prodromal->MCI) and how they relate to state-of-the-art biomarkers
of the ATN framework and AD/ADRD heterogeneity. Our approach will combine standard UDS 3 assessments
with an innovative NYU-specific protocol that uses advanced MR and PET neuroimaging, robust clinical
phenotyping schemes, and new biofluid/disease monitoring strategies. We propose 4 specific aims. Aim 1 is to
comprehensively characterize a cohort of ~500 community-dwelling older adults [70% normal, 20-25% MCI, 40%
from Black/African-American and Latino groups] with (a) a unique protocol for longitudinal clinical phenotyping
and biomarker analysis to evaluate preclinical/prodromal disease and AD/ADRD heterogeneity, (b) timely data
reporting to participants and national repositories, and, (c) brain donation consenting to establish clinical-
biomarker-pathological correlations. Aim 2 is to support a large network of interventional AD/ADRD trials and in-
house affiliated studies on multi-etiology dementia by maintaining a dynamic registry of “study-ready”
participants. Aim 3 is to improve the clinical phenotyping of at-risk/early stage subjects by (a) developing novel
characterization schemes for neuropsychiatric symptoms and SCD and (b) leveraging emerging technology to
investigate digital biomarkers related to cognition, sleep, and motor function. Aim 4 is to improve clinical skills of
dementia practitioners, promote the use of CC data for AD/ADRD research among early career investigators,
and educate the public about AD/ADRD and the value of normal controls and brain/biospecimen donation. These
aims allow the CC to advance its state-of-the-art program that is well poised to answer critical questions within
the current AD/ADRD research framework and contribute to NAPA research implementation milestones."

The good news is that increasingly, patients who experience an ischemic stroke survive. Unfortunately, survivors
are rarely unscathed — stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in the U.S. Interventions are limited in
part due to a lack of insight into secondary processes post-stroke. Neural stem cells (NSCs) have demonstrated
therapeutic benefit in stroke recovery. But key questions remain that if answered, could enhance clinical use.
NSCs normally migrate to the lesion, secrete pro-reparative factors, differentiate, and reduce secondary damage.
Central to these benefits is the ability of NSCs to send and respond to specific environmental cues. Our data
show NSC function is influenced by low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP1), a multifunctional
receptor that modulates cell signaling via multiple mechanisms. Despite an expansive role in signal modulation,
the importance of LRP1 in NSC biology is virtually unstudied. We knocked-out LRP1 in adult NSCs and subjected
mice to middle-cerebral artery occlusion. We found LRP1-KO in NSCs ablated migration to ischemic lesions.
We also discovered that functional impairment and lesion size were reduced. This observation is somewhat
paradoxical-physical localization of NSCs to lesions is often considered important to neuroprotective efficacy.
We also found that LRP1-KO ablates expression of CXCR4, a chemokine receptor which is essential for
migration to ischemic lesions. Thus, we seek to better understand how impaired LRP1 expression in NSCs is
neuroprotective, and similarly to understand the mechanisms underlying LRP1 regulation of CXCR4. Our overall
hypothesis is that LRP1 promotes NSC migration toward ischemic lesions through CXCR4 regulation,
yet also limits the endogenous NSC-neuroprotective response. Our data suggest that LRP1 is a major driver
of NSC response to signals. This proposal investigates LRP1, CXCR4, and NSC function in stroke using surgical
models, in vivo, and in vitro approaches. We utilize a Nestin-CreERt2 mouse model to direct knock-out of LRP1
and/or CXCR4 in NSCs and to track these cells with expression of red fluorescent protein. Aim 1 tests the
hypothesis that NSC-mediated neuroprotection is due to loss of LRP1, which promotes recovery
independent of effects on CXCR4 by measuring post-stroke outcomes after rescuing expression of CXCR4 in
mice with LRP1-KO in NSCs, or ablating LRP1 in mice with CXCR4-KO in NSCs. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis
that loss of LRP1 (or CXCR4) is neuroprotective by enhancing post-stroke NSC neuroprotective
response by interrogating the effect on NSC post-stroke response and survival, both in vivo and in vitro. Aim 3
tests the mechanism by which LRP1 regulates CXCR4 expression by rescuing LRP1 with domain-specific
constructs and elucidating the effect on transcription, signaling, trafficking, and degradation of CXCR4. Data
from these studies will define the value of NSC-LRP1 as a therapeutic target, identify discrete mechanisms of
LRP1-mediated neuroprotection, and define the mechanism by which LRP1 regulates CXCR4 expression."
10829903,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In women, reproductive aging is marked by a dramatic decline in ovarian hormone production, and is a time
when many women report changes in memory and attention. Animal studies provide powerful evidence that
ovarian hormones, in particular 17β-estradiol, play a critical role in shaping the morphology and function of
brain regions that are central to higher order cognitive processes and cognitive aging. The degree to which
female reproductive aging leads to macrostructural changes in human brain morphology, changes in brain
connectivity, and ultimately changes in cognitive functioning represents a significant knowledge gap that has
yet to be adequately examined. Ovarian hormone suppression (OHS), a widely used treatment for
endometriosis, offers a unique clinical scenario through which to study the impact of estrogen and
progesterone changes on the brain and cognition. The treatment allows for the temporary and reversible
induction of a postmenopausal-like endocrine status, the effects of which can be observed over the course of a
few months, and offers a human analogue of animal studies that have provided substantial evidence for the
neuroprotective effects of ovarian hormones and their influence on neural function. In the proposed
observational study, we will examine 200 adult women with endometriosis (ages 25 to 40), half of whom will
undergo OHS via the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist Elagolix, and half of whom will follow
a non-hormonal treatment plan, in order to gain critical insights into how the depletion of ovarian hormones
impacts the brain and cognition. Women will be examined pre-treatment and at 6 months post-baseline to
characterize the progression of changes in response to OHS. In Aim 1, we will characterize the effects of OHS
on cognitive functioning. We will employ a comprehensive neuropsychological battery to assess changes in
cognition brought on by OHS. In Aim 2, we will utilize state-of-the-field neuroimaging techniques to
characterize the impact of OHS on structural brain measures, specifically targeting subfields of the
hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex, and white matter pathways using diffusion spectrum imaging. In Aim 3,
we will use resting state and task-based fMRI paradigms to determine the effects of OHS on global and
regional brain networks. We hypothesize that OHS will impact intrinsic correlations in the default mode,
frontoparietal, and limbic networks at rest, and alter prefrontal cortex efficiency during working memory.
Finally, in Aim 4, we will test whether polygenic risk for Alzheimer’s disease modifies the effects of OHS on the
brain and cognition. The multimodal cognitive neuroscience approach will allows us to model a core aspect of
reproductive aging, ovarian hormone depletion, while holding chronological age relatively fixed. This project
will clarify the role of ovarian hormones in shaping brain architecture and cognitive functioning, a severely
understudied arena in cognitive neuroscience with clear implications for women’s health."
10834056,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Feeding behavior is critical for animal survival, and is also a fundamental aspect of energy homeostasis. This
process is regulated by highly complex neurochemical pathways involving a multitude of neuropeptides and
biogenic amines. Despite decades of work on individual neurochemical systems, the general organizational
principles underlying neuromodulation are still poorly understood. This is mainly due to the fact that
modulation of neural circuit has so far been studied primarily one modulator at a time without the knowledge
about co-modulation of networks. The latter information would require the development of sensitive and
selective analytical tools to precisely identify these low abundance endogenous signaling molecules and
accurately measure their behaviorally-relevant concentrations in a complex microenvironment. Our proposed
research aims to address this critical knowledge and technological gap by developing new bioanalytical
methods to elucidate the complex identities and functional roles of neuropeptides in food intake via combined
mass spectrometric and physiological approaches. We employ the crustacean stomatogastric nervous
system, cardiovascular system, and its associated neuroendocrine organs as a test-bed for technology
development and validation due to the unique advantages and biological significance of this model system. In
parallel, we aim to translate our technology development for neuropeptide discovery and analysis to the
mammalian central nervous system. To this end, we propose to focus on key brain regions in a rat model at
progressively more complex levels of feeding-related information processing. The specific aims include: (1)
Developing and applying mass defect-based, amine reactive chemical tags coupled with data-independent
acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry (MS)-based strategy for multiplexed quantitation of neuropeptide changes
under different feeding conditions; (2) Developing a nanosecond photochemical reaction (nsPCR)-assisted
MALDI-based mass spectral imaging (MSI) technique for mapping co-localization patterns of individual
isoforms of extended peptide families and amine neurotransmitters in identified neurons and the feeding
circuits, with enhanced sensitivity and chemical information; and (3) Assessing functional roles of
neuropeptides in feeding and cardiac regulation using a multi-pronged approach integrating in vivo
microdialysis and ex vivo physiological and behavioral measurements. Novel neuropeptides will be evaluated
for functional roles in feeding regulation at the neuronal network and system levels. The outcome of the
proposed research will be a suite of new analytical tools enabling quantitative assessment of the interplay of
neuropeptides and biogenic amines with high spatial, chemical and temporal information. The parallel
application of these new methods to both crustacean and mammalian nervous systems in feeding will
accelerate our pace towards the development of new therapeutics for feeding disorders."
10834872,"The use of radioembolization has been shown to be successful for the treatment and downstaging of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as well as liver metastases, and advantages over traditional chemoembolizaion
have been reported. The local beta emissions from this technique have been shown to provide therapeutic effect
within the tumor. Dosages range from 110-150 Gy, but radiation delivered to malignant tissue is dependent on
distance from the yttrium source. Radiotherapy is only effective in treating HCC in doses above 50 Gy.
Consequently, treatment response after radioembolization is between 25-60% when based on response criteria
in solid tumors (mRECIST). We propose to use ultrasound-triggered microbubble destruction (UTMD) to improve
radioembolization of HCC. This technique uses commercial ultrasound contrast agents, whose ultrasound
triggered cavitation results in a variety of well documented bioeffects. Localized microbubble cavitation has been
shown to sensitize malignant tissue to radiotherapy by inducing vascular endothelial-cell apoptosis. Thus,
localized UTMD after radioembolization of HCC may potentially improve tumor response by selectively
sensitizing malignant tissue to radiotherapy. In addition, the rate of contrast reperfusion after a destructive pulse
can be quantified and used to estimate blood perfusion and fractional vascularity. Changes in fractional
vascularity and perfusion may be a potential earlier indicator of treatment response, thereby enabling earlier
retreatment in non-responding patients.
 We propose a clinical trial using localized microbubble cavitation followed by imaging of contrast washing
back into the tumor (termed reperfusion) to improve patient outcomes and predict treatment response earlier
than the current clinical standards. Patients scheduled for radioembolization of HCC will be randomized to
receive radioembolization alone or radioembolization in combination with a contrast ultrasound exam 2-4 hours
and 7 and 14 days post radioembolization. A flash destruction-replenishment technique will be used to induce
microbubble cavitation at multiple planes within the tumor vasculature. Tumoral response, safety, radioactive
bead distribution, liver function, and alpha fetal protein, will then be evaluated and compared between groups.
As a secondary aim, tumor perfusion will be quantified in the experimental group based on the rate of contrast
agent reperfusion following each destructive ultrasound pulse. Patients will then be stratified according to
mRECIST criteria 3-4 months post treatment based on their clinically scheduled follow-up MRI/CT study.
Microbubble-derived tumor reperfusion rate will be compared between groups to determine if treatment response
can be predicted 7-14 days post therapy. Once validated, this technique is expected to improve patient outcomes
by selectively sensitizing malignant tissue to radiotherapy, and by enabling alternative forms of treatment through
earlier identification of patients not responding to therapy."
10834961,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Spirochetes of the Borrelia genus are the cause of several prevalent vector-borne diseases. The most
well-known pathogen from this group is Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, which causes over 300,000 cases of
Lyme disease in the United States each year. B. garinii and B. afzelii, which belong to the B. burgdorferi sensu
lato complex, are the primary agent of Lyme disease in Europe and Asia. Borrelia spirochetes are also the
etiological agent of the ancient human disease relapsing fever, as well as a newly recognized infectious
condition called Borrelia miyamotoi disease. Lyme-associated, relapsing fever-associated, and B. miyamotoi
spirochetes have differing lifecycles and their infections are accompanied by distinct clinical presentations.
However, each of these pathogens are known to encode multifunctional surface-expressed lipoproteins that
interact with vertebrate host molecules. Among these proteins are a small arsenal of immunomodulators that
specifically target and inactivate a primary arm of innate immunity known as the complement system. We have
recently reported two independent lines of evidence that support the hypothesis that one of these pathways,
known as the classical pathway, is important in controlling B. burgdorferi infections. First, we have shown that
mice deficient in the pattern recognition molecule of the classical pathway, C1q, are significantly more
susceptible to B. burgdorferi infection. Secondly, we have shown that the lipoprotein B. burgdorferi BBK32 is a
high-affinity inhibitor of the initiating protease of the classical pathway, C1r.
 In Aim 1 of this project we seek to understand the C1r inhibitory activity of BBK32 sensu lato proteins at
the molecular level. In Aim 2 we will determine the immunomodulatory roles and virulence contribution of three
BBK32 orthologues known as FbpA, FbpB, and FbpC which are found uniquely in relapsing fever and B.
miyamotoi spirochetes. In Aim 3 we will delineate the role of C1r inhibition in borrelial pathogenesis using in
vivo models of disease. To achieve this, we propose a multi-disciplinary strategy that employs x-ray
crystallography, biophysical approaches, and complement functional assays to pinpoint key ‘hot-spot’ residues
on BBK32 that give rise to its potent anti-C1r activity. These data will inform the design of bbk32 mutants which
will be used in mouse infectivity studies to connect structural features of BBK32, at the amino-acid level, to an
in vivo phenotype. Parallel studies will use genetic deletion mutants of fbp genes from the relapsing fever-
associated spirochetes B. turicatae and B. hermsii. These studies will be paired with experimental models of
Lyme and relapsing fever borrelioses using C1r-/- mice to better understand the role of the classical pathway
initiating protease in the control of borrelial infections. By addressing fundamental questions of how medically
important Borrelia spirochetes recognize and evade host immunity, the studies proposed here stand to have a
broad and significant impact on the field of bacterial pathogenesis."
10836033,"PROJECT SUMMARY
HIV infection can persist long-term antiretroviral therapy as a reservoir of provirus integrated into host cell
genomes. The stability and activity of this reservoir depends on the complex interplay between viral and host
mechanisms. The overall goal of this P01 is to characterize the mechanisms of formation, persistence,
reactivation, and therapeutic responsiveness of the HIV reservoir in unprecedented detail. This will involve
generating high-dimensional and longitudinal single-cell and single-genome datasets. The role of the Data
Analytics & Modeling Core is to provide specialized quantitative methods to each of the research projects to
aid in the design and interpretation of the experimental studies. The Core will bring together analytical experts
contributing to each project to collaboratively plan, conduct, and interpret analyses. Core members will develop
and apply state-of-the-art bioinformatic methods to interpret high-dimensional biological data characterizing the
HIV reservoir. They will additionally develop and apply mechanistic viral dynamics models to understand the
mechanism of reservoir formation, persistence, and reactivation, with the long-term goal of predicting
outcomes of novel therapeutics. Overall the Data Analytics & Modeling Core will advance the goals of this
program project by building a more complete understanding of the causes and consequences of HIV reservoir
dynamics."

10836451,"The goal of the Translational Alcohol Research Program (TARP) is to facilitate the ability of
emerging post-doctoral researchers to bridge the gap in the application of knowledge gained from
basic to clinical and social behavioral science research in alcohol use disorders (AUD) and alcohol-
related liver disease (ALD). Both AUD and ALD are major public health problems and they should be
considered together in the diagnosis and management of alcohol abuse and alcoholism. There is a gap
in the application of knowledge f rom basic science studies to clinical models. This is particularly
concerning given the establishment of a new generation of approaches (e.g., genomic, whole-body
imaging) that allow the application of a `systems' approach to the study of AUD and ALD. It is of critical
importance that future investigators are able to exploit these new research tools and approaches to
accelerate the discovery and development of new treatments for ALD and AUD. The TARP is designed to
improve clinical treatment of AUD and ALD by increasing the availability of appropriately-trained young
scientists who are conversant in basic and clinical sciences and able to comfortably traverse the
translational gap between these sciences. It is a two-year program offered by the Yale Schools of
Medicine and Public Health and provides six post-doctoral trainees the opportunity to devote full-time
effort during the initial phase of their careers to developing the skills and experience needed to become
independent researchers in the field of translational research in AUD and ALD. The TARP has four main
“content areas” viz. Reward Mechanisms; Stress and Negative Affect; Comorbidity (psychiatric and
medical); and Alcoholic Liver Disease. The affiliation of TARP faculty with the NIAAA-funded Center for
the Translational Neuroscience of Alcoholism and/or the Yale Liver Center enables the TARP trainees to
conduct research that readily gravitates between preclinical projects (“bench”) and clinical and population
health studies (“bedside” and “community”). Applicants will be MD or PhD post-doctoral candidates,
trained in specialties including psychiatry, internal medicine, clinical psychology, public health,
epidemiology, pharmacology, toxicology, or neuroscience. The TARP includes: 1) individualized, team-
mentored research training, which includes successful completion of a translational-research project, 2) a
core curriculum, including seminars on preclinical and clinical research and treatment, the medical
consequences of excessive alcohol consumption, hepatology, metabolomics, biostatistics, responsible
conduct of scientific research, and grant writing, 3) an individualized training and development plan
(including participation in seminars of interest in associated departments and centers), 4) clinical and/or
basic science training, and 5) training in effective communication and teaching. Upon completion, TARP
graduates will be equipped to establish independent careers in translational research in AUD and ALD."
10933509,"PROJECT SUMMARY
United States (US) pregnancy-related mortality (PRM) has more than doubled over the last two decades, with
an additional 1.5-fold post-pandemic rise. There are also striking socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic disparities
US PRM. It’s estimated that 80% of US PRM is preventable, yet rates remain high and disparities remain wide.
Roughly half of US PRM occurs postpartum (PP) after hospital discharge. During this period, cardiometabolic
and mental health conditions are precipitating factors in most deaths. Such data is particularly alarming
considering that only 60% of patients receive healthcare during the PP year and few patients receive care that
is adherent to evidence-based guidelines, particularly after pregnancy affected by a cardiometabolic or mental
health condition. This is perhaps not surprising considering that patients consistently report that, “after you
have [a] baby, it’s all about the baby and you don’t have time for yourself.” And providers consistently report
that the obstetric to PP primary care hand-off is challenging. Mothers with low socioeconomic status (SES) and
from minoritized backgrounds are least likely to receive PP care but most likely to exhibit a major risk factor for
PRM, which is driven by structural and individual racism and discrimination, including in healthcare. In
collaboration with the Ohio Department of Medicaid, we designed a novel dyadic mother-infant PP primary
care program targeted toward Medicaid-insured, minoritized patients transitioning out of high-risk pregnancy –
the Multi-modal Maternal Infant Perinatal Outpatient Delivery System (MOMI PODS). Dyadic care is a
critical component of the model, with mothers and infants cared for in tandem throughout the PP year, and
beyond. MOMI PODS was also strategically designed to 1) facilitate a coordinated obstetric to PP primary care
transition, 2) promote tailored, evidence-based care informed by the obstetric history, and 3) integrate clinical
and supportive care to concurrently address clinical and psychosocial needs. We have now established 7
MOMI PODS sites and delivered MOMI PODS to >150 dyads. Our compelling preliminary data shows that
MOMI PODS is feasible and acceptable, with patients attending 95% of visits that systematically incorporate
clinical and supportive care. In the MOMI PODS hybrid type 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT), we’ll
evaluate the effectiveness of MOMI PODS in mitigating PP cardiometabolic and mental health risk, identify the
biopsychosocial mechanisms linking MOMI PODS to PP health, determine if MOMI PODS reduces disparities
in PP care delivery, and identify strategies to improve implementation. Our central hypothesis is that MOMI
PODS will mitigate PP risk and reduce disparities in PP risk by improving biopsychosocial profiles and
facilitating access to evidence-based clinical and supportive care. Thus, the MOMI PODS RCT represents a
critical step toward establishing an equitable, scalable model of integrative PP clinical and supportive care that
is capable of mitigating PRM risk and addressing PRM disparities. MOMI PODS has significant potential to
serve as a foundational model of care appropriate for scale up and replication in diverse healthcare settings."
10841525,"The Department of Veterans Affairs is the largest provider of medical care to people with HIV in the United
States; in 2016 ~30,000 Veterans received treatment for HIV from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).
Over the last several decades, the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment for HIV infection has
changed the demographics and phenotype of Veterans living with HIV. Although HIV+ Veterans are living longer,
78% of them are overweight or obese, and they have a two-fold greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes
compared to Veterans without HIV. While much of the research on HIV and metabolic disease has focused on
the interaction between obesity and the accumulation of ectopic fat in the liver, several recent studies highlight
the central role of ectopic fat in skeletal muscle in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and diabetes. However,
this important phenomenon has received little attention in the context of HIV infection and the role of skeletal
muscle ectopic fat in the complex interaction between HIV and obesity remains unclear.
Defects in adipose tissue lipid storage and regulation are hallmark of both HIV infection and obesity, which leads
to a high degree of ectopic fat accumulation in tissues such as the liver and skeletal muscle. While several
studies have investigated ectopic liver fat as a risk factor for diabetes in HIV, our novel hypothesis is that impaired
glucose tolerance in Veterans with treated HIV and obesity is driven by disproportionately greater ectopic lipid
infiltration of skeletal muscle (the primary site of glucose uptake) promoting impaired myocyte bioenergetics and
glucose homeostasis (Fig.1). This is supported by our preliminary CT imaging, MRS imaging, and glucose
metabolism data that implicate skeletal muscle pathology in HIV associated glucose intolerance: 1) Our CT data
show ectopic fat infiltration in muscle is greater in HIV+ diabetics vs nondiabetics; 2) Our MRS data show higher
muscle triglyceride content is associated with a slower rate of ATP synthesis; 3) Our metabolic data show lower
plasma acylcarnitines (indicating impaired mitochondrial oxidation) correlates with insulin resistance in HIV.
In the proposed study, we aim to determine: a) whether the deposition of excess lipid in skeletal muscle in HIV+
Veterans is a phenomenon separate from hepatic fat deposition and a hallmark for T2DM in this population (Aim
1); b) whether skeletal muscle fat accumulates over time in nondiabetic overweight/obese Veterans and is
accompanied by reductions in muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity, ATP production, and muscle force (Aim
2); and c) whether changes in skeletal muscle ectopic fat and mitochondrial oxidative capacity over time are
accompanied by reductions in insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance (Aim 3).
To accomplish these aims, we will recruit two cohorts of HIV+ Veterans on long-term ART that will be matched
by sex, age, race, BMI and CD4/CD8 ratio. Group 1: 45 Veterans with HIV, obesity and type 2 diabetes; Group
2: 45 Veterans with HIV, obesity and no diabetes. Our study will: 1) determine the contribution of ectopic fat in
skeletal muscle vs liver to developing glucose intolerance in HIV; 2) identify temporal changes and determine
relationships in skeletal muscle ectopic fat infiltration and impairments in mitochondrial function in HIV; 3) identify
temporal changes and clarify relationships between skeletal muscle ectopic fat, liver ectopic fat, mitochondrial
function, and glucose tolerance in HIV; 4) establish a foundation for future studies targeting ectopic fat deposition
to improve metabolic health; and 5) inform our understanding of lipid pathology and the development of diabetes
in treated HIV, yielding opportunities for interventions to advance the healthcare of our Veterans."
10841660,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been linked to increased risk of tobacco use and
other substance use disorders. In particular, individuals with a higher number of ACEs are more
likely to smoke cigarettes, initiate smoking at earlier ages, progress to heavier smoking, have
higher levels of dependence, and are less likely to quit. However, very few human laboratory
studies have been conducted to examine interactions between ACEs and risk for smoking, and
the mechanisms underlying these associations are poorly understood. Based on several
converging lines of evidence, we propose a translational framework in which ACEs are
associated with alterations in corticostriatal circuitry contributing to dysregulated reward
processing, which in turn increases sensitivity to reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse, including
nicotine. The proposed research will apply a laboratory model of initial nicotine exposure using
nasal spray to examine subjective reactions and reinforcing effects of nicotine among young
adult non-smokers (n=150) with a history of ACEs ranging from 0 to 4 or more. Participants will
first complete a functional neuroimaging protocol designed to assess mesolimbic reactivity to
monetary reward, prefrontal inhibitory control, and corticostriatal functional connectivity.
Subjective reactions to 0, .5, or 1 mg doses of nicotine nasal spray will be assessed during
three separate fixed-dose visits. We will then evaluate reinforcing effects of nicotine during a
choice session. In general, we hypothesize that increased exposure to ACEs will be associated
with greater positive subjective and reinforcing effects of nicotine, that deficits in corticostriatal
circuitry will mediate the association between ACEs and nicotine reactions, and that this
association will be stronger among women. These results will provide a critical translation from
animal models demonstrating consequences of early life stress on neurobiological pathways
relevant to addiction. Moreover, this work will help to explain the increased risk for smoking
among individuals exposed to ACEs and will have implications for prevention and treatment of
smoking in this high-risk population and beyond."
10841665,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The basolateral amygdala (BLA) serves as a neural hub for the integration of various inputs from across the
brain to, in turn, control fear and anxiety-related behaviors and the response to chronic stress. Given this central
role in neuropsychiatric disease-relevant emotional processing, neuromodulatory G protein-coupled receptors
(GPCRs) that can control BLA function have been proposed as targets for the treatment of anxiety disorders and
post-traumatic stress disorder. However, due to the complexity of BLA circuits and the lack of tools for
spatiotemporally and genetically precise manipulation of GPCRs in vivo, it remains difficult to understand how
specific receptors in defined cell types or projections mediate their effects on BLA circuit function and behavior.
 Here we will focus on an understanding of how metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2) modulates
anxiety and fear-related behaviors using recently developed genetically-targeted photopharmacology in
conjunction with slice electrophysiology, behavior, fiber photometry and RNA sequencing. mGluR2 is a critical
presynaptic G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) which mediates both rapid synaptic inhibition and the induction
of long-term depression (LTD), although connecting these dynamic synaptic processes to behavioral modulation
has been challenging. Our preliminary mapping studies using a Grm2-Cre mouse have shown that mGluR2 is
enriched in projections from the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and posterior insular cortex (pIC) to the
BLA, motivating our comparative analysis of these two projection classes. We will define the ability of mGluR2
in each projection to control the synaptic strength of cortical connection to BLA pyramidal neurons and
interneurons and use our photopharmacological toolset to link presynaptic modulation to behavioral changes
across a battery of measures of avoidance to aversive stimuli and auditory fear conditioning (aim 1, aim 2). We
hypothesize that depending on the nature of the aversive stimulus (spatial, somatosensory, social) either inputs
from the vmPFC or pIC will play primary roles in behavioral control. In aim 3, we will use a dual optogenetic and
projection-targeted RNA sequencing approach to define the synaptic and molecular adaptations that occur in
each pathway in response to chronic unpredictable stress. Such analysis should inform future studies of novel
projection-defined drug targets that can have desired effects on different aspects of fear and anxiety. Together
this project will introduce a novel approach to mapping the synaptic and circuit mechanisms of behavioral control
by neuromodulatory GPCRs while providing new insights into neuromodulatory control of the BLA by presynaptic
mGluR2."
10841714,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The proposed research will use state of the art electron microscopic (EM) connectomics combined with
specific pathway tracing to analyze the convergent inputs involving cortical and thalamic circuitry in mice.
Labeling will be via different types of engineered ascorbate peroxidase (APX) that will tag either cytoplasm for
some injections or mitochondria for others. Volumes of cortex and convergent inputs to be analyzed are: thalamic
VPm & POm input to S1; thalamic LGN & Pul input to V1; S1 & POm input to M1; thalamic POm & VA/VL inputs
to M1; and layer 5 inputs from different cortical areas to a thalamic nucleus (those to be initially analyzed are V1
& S1 convergent input to LD and V1 & V2, to Pul). We shall also analyze in each of the cortical areas under
connectomic analysis inputs from layer 4 to layers 2/3 and local lateral connections within layers 2/3. The
detailed connectomics analysis will allow us to determine the different connection patterns of the various labeled
convergent afferents, including the extent to which they converge onto single cells.
 Regarding the analysis of cortical layer 5 convergent inputs to a thalamic nucleus, we expect this to address
an open question of great import regarding thalamic functioning. Limited studies so far suggest that there is little
or no functional convergence of different information streams onto individual thalamic relay cells. Thus retinal
input to LGN cells involves little or no convergence, and even when there is little convergence (usually ≤3 retinal
axons), the inputs are of the same type (e.g., X or Y retinal axons) with virtually no mixing of types. This suggests
a simple relay function for thalamus. However, these analyses have been mostly limited to first order thalamic
nuclei (i.e., those receiving driving input from subcortical sources, like the retina). Recent study of higher order
nuclei (i.e., those receiving driving input from cortical layer 5) suggests that these might have convergent input
from different cortical areas. We will test this, and if we find such convergent input onto single relay cells, this
will transform our understanding of thalamic function, because it will demonstrate that, at least for some higher
order nuclei, significant alteration in the nature of incoming information occurs before relay to cortex.
 In addition to these analyses allowing a better understanding of cortical and thalamic circuitry and their
interactions, most of the pathways to be studied have independently been analyzed physiologically for
characteristics of driver vs modulator properties. We thus expect to find significant correlations between these
physiological data and the proposed connectomics analyses, which we believe will allow future connectomic
studies to be interpreted on a functional basis heretofore unavailable."
10841715,"ABSTRACT. 1.6 million Americans suffer from functional tricuspid valve regurgitation (FTR); that is, tricuspid
valve leakage due to valve-extrinsic factors such as pulmonary hypertension-induced right ventricular
remodeling. Of those patients, only approximately 8-10 thousand are surgically treated. This undertreatment of
patients with FTR has been declared “a public health crisis”. While the reasons for undertreatment are multi-fold,
one is unarguably that available treatment options have suboptimal outcomes while being high-risk; thus, tilting
the risk-benefit scale toward conservative treatment. For example, FTR recurs in as many as 10-30% of patients
treated via the gold-standard surgical technique tricuspid valve annuloplasty. Additionally, mortality rates of re-
operation are exorbitantly high (>30%). Clearly, better therapeutic approaches are needed to treat FTR and to
stop undertreatment of a large patient population. Our collaborative team has recently shown in two separate
sheep models that the tricuspid valve leaflets grow and fibrotically remodel in FTR. The discovery of tricuspid
valve (mal)adaptation now raises the possibility to both harness the valve’s native ability to grow, and thereby
counteract disease, and to therapeutically target leaflet fibrosis. However, before being able to use our new
knowledge toward improving treatment of FTR and toward overcoming today’s massive undertreatment, tricuspid
valve maladaptation must be better understood: To date, we don’t know its stimuli, the mechanisms of its
detrimental effects on valve function, or how therapy may be used to suppress fibrosis. The objective of this
current proposal is to overcome these gaps in knowledge. To this end, we will test our central hypothesis that
disease-induced leaflet strains stimulate leaflet maladaptation which, in turn, hinders valve coaptation and
contributes to FTR, and that leaflet maladaptation may be halted by counteracting disease-induced stimuli. We
will pursue our objective in three aims: 1) Identify the stimuli of tricuspid valve maladaptation, 2) Delineate the
mechanisms through which maladaptation impedes valve function, 3) Test whether prophylactic intervention
halts maladaptation. To accomplish these aims, we will combine innovative, chronic sheep models with in-vitro
flow loop valve characterization using high-speed 3D imaging, and extensive mechanical, compositional, and
biological tissue phenotyping. Our team has a long collaborative track record of studying tricuspid valve function
and disease, and is supported by a senior colleague with 30 years of experience in in-vitro valve experimentation.
Upon conclusion of this work, we expect to have identified the stimuli for tricuspid valve maladaptation,
understand the mechanisms through which it impedes valve function, and have shown that it can be halted
through surgical intervention. Thus, we will have shed light on a recently identified disease mechanism of the
tricuspid valve and suggested it as a novel therapeutic target. Our work will therefore pave the way toward a
better understanding and better treatment of FTR as a public health crisis. While our work is surgically-focused,
it is equally important to transcatheter repair strategies which amplifies the significance of our work and its impact."

The goals of this project are to determine the molecular mechanisms that control activity of the tandem pore
(K2P) family of potassium channels, with a focus on how K2Ps integrate a diverse set of incoming signals to
regulate channel function. K2Ps are ion channels primarily responsible for producing background “leak” currents
that set cellular resting membrane potential. Modulation of K2P activity directly affects cellular excitability and
K2P channels have been implicated to play important roles in cardiac, neuronal, endocrine, and vascular biology.
The mechanosensitive subfamily of K2Ps that are the focus of this proposal have been identified as potential
drug development targets for treatment of cardiac arrhythmia, depression, and chronic pain, though efforts to
develop small molecule modulators that target K2Ps have largely failed to produce high affinity and subtype
selective agents. Meanwhile, endogenous lipids are known to modulate many K2P channels and show strong
subtype specificity. The overall aim of this proposal is to examine the basic biology underlying K2P modulation
by lipids and the related effects of membrane tension, with the long-term goal of using this knowledge to develop
a framework for development of improved pharmacology against K2P channels. To achieve these goals, we will
pursue a multifaceted approach that includes cryoEM structural studies, native mass spectrometry to define
K2P/lipid interactions, and electrophysiological functional studies of K2P behavior. Our first aim will examine the
mechanisms by which positive and negative allosteric membrane phosopholipids or free fatty acids are sensed
by K2P channels, with a focus on the molecular details of lipid binding sites in the K2P structure. We will also
address the basis for the interrelated impacts of allosteric lipids and membrane tension on K2P gating behavior.
In aim2, we will explore the mechanism by which lipids, mechanosensitivity, and other K2P input signals control
channel output at the ion conducting potassium selectivity filter, defining the molecular connectivity within the
structural architecture of the K2P channel. Taken together, our studies will provide a detailed structural model
of K2P gating and modulation that is broadly relevant to the basic biology of this important family of channels."

The macular pigment carotenoids, lutein, zeaxanthin, and lutein’s metabolite meso-zeaxanthin are
uniquely concentrated in the primate foveal region to form the yellow pigment of the macula lutea
where they can enhance visual function and protect against the light-induced oxidative damage that has
been associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and other disorders of the retina. Diets
and supplements enriched in lutein and zeaxanthin are among the most widely prescribed interventions
for patients concerned about future visual loss from AMD, and these xanthophyll carotenoids have
become standard-of-care for individuals with large drusen or advanced AMD in one eye based on
AREDS2 results; however, it is common in the United States for patients and clinicians to integrate
nutritional interventions into clinical practice beyond indications established in large, randomized
clinical trials such as AREDS2, and carotenoids are no exception. For example, lutein has been
incorporated into prenatal supplements and infant formulas without any clinical trials at all, based only
on the hope that it might promote health and development of the child’s visual system, and nondietary
carotenoids such as meso-zeaxanthin are now being promoted as “next generation AREDS
supplements”, again without adequate clinical or basic science studies. The Bernstein laboratory is
dedicated to provide mechanistic insights into the biochemistry, physiology, and pharmacology of the
macular carotenoids to optimize rational, safe interventions against blinding diseases throughout the
lifespan. The key organizing concept that drives the laboratory’s research is that the specific deposition
and protective functions of the three macular carotenoids in the human foveal region are mediated by
complex, regulated interplay of binding proteins, transporters, and metabolic enzymes. The research
group examines this premise using an integrated approach that includes biochemical studies on the
enzymology and protein biochemistry of carotenoid transport and metabolism, animal models for
carotenoid function in the eye in health and disease using transgenic “macular pigment mice”
genetically engineered to have enhanced carotenoid uptake into the retina relative to wild-type mice,
and advanced imaging techniques with particular emphasis on resonance Raman imaging to localize the
macular carotenoids at unprecedented spectral and spatial resolution. The results of these studies will
advance mechanistic knowledge of their physiological functions at a molecular level, which will enable
basic studies that account for their roles in retinal neuroprotection, as well as clinical studies that will
lead to rational, scientifically supported decisions about treatments to prevent visual loss throughout a
person’s lifetime."

 This K23 application aims to support Dr. Stephanie Manasse in her overarching goal of becoming an
independent clinical researcher focused on developing and evaluating novel treatments for obesity. The
proposed application will strengthen the candidate’s ability to meet this goal by providing advanced training to:
(1) Gain expertise in theoretical models and measurement of decision-making; (2) develop expertise in
nutritional and meal pattern analysis; (3) design and execute clinical trials for adolescent obesity; (4) Build
proficiency with multilevel and longitudinal data analytic approaches related to clinical trial research. To
achieve these goals, an expert team of mentors has been assembled, consisting of primary mentor Dr. Evan
Forman (for conducting obesity clinical trials); co-mentors Dr. Adrienne Juarascio (for training in conduct of
clinical trials for individuals with disordered eating), Dr. Joseph Kable (for training in models and measurement
of decision-making), Dr. Tanja Kral (for training in meal pattern and nutritional analysis in pediatric obesity), Dr.
Tanofsky-Kraff (for training in assessment and clinical trial methods in adolescent obesity and loss-of-control
eating) and Dr. Zoe Zhang (for training in longitudinal statistical methods); and consultants Dr. Robert
Berkowitz (biological considerations of adolescence on weight and weight change) and Dr. Laurence Steinberg
(for training in models of adolescent decision-making).
 As part of this training, Dr. Manasse will complete a project that will examine the predictive role of
aberrant decision-making processes (i.e., delay discounting, affect-driven impulsivity, and perseverative
decision-making) in weight loss outcomes from behavioral treatment for adolescent obesity. Second, the study
will also examine the influence of aberrant decision-making on problematic eating behaviors during treatment
that are likely driving poor weight loss outcomes: reward-driven overeating, loss-of-control eating, and
problematic dietary restriction. Third, the study will examine whether these problematic eating behaviors
mediate the influence of aberrant decision-making on weight loss outcomes. We will recruit 60 adolescents
(ages 14-18) with (n=30) and without (n=30) clinically significant LOC eating who will complete a behavioral
weight loss program and complete measures of decision-making at baseline. Problematic eating behaviors and
weight outcomes will be evaluated at mid-treatment (6 weeks), post-treatment (16 weeks), 6-month follow-up,
and 12-month follow-up. The current study will provide critical information that will directly lead into the
development of a novel adolescent obesity intervention augmentation that will be poised reduce aberrant
decision-making and improve weight loss outcomes. Given the poor efficacy of weight loss treatments in
adolescents, novel augmentations that target the unique developmental factors of adolescence are necessary.
Therefore, in addition to helping launch the candidate into an independent research career, this project will
meet a critical need by providing much-needed knowledge for adolescent obesity treatment development."
10843252,"Infections and cellular stress can trigger cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors to assemble an
inflammasome complex, which promotes the release of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-18 and the
induction of pyroptotic cell death. Inflammasome responses are also perpetuated and propagated to bystander
cells. Ultimately, this response contributes to pathogen clearance and wound healing. However, excessive
inflammasome activation can contribute to- or cause debilitating symptoms associated with inflammatory
diseases. Particularly, the NLRP3 inflammasome has been directly linked to numerous diseases. It has a
unique position by not only sensing infections, but also cellular stress and tissue damage. Even though the
NLRP3 inflammasome is of utmost importance for balancing between homeostasis and disease, and is
therefore a prime target for novel treatment strategies, the underlying molecular mechanisms, particularly in
human macrophages, are still poorly understood. There are numerous human inflammasome components that
are absent in mice and their functional contribution to human health and disease are even less well understood
than the more conserved factors. Elucidating unique human responses is the main focus of our lab.
 Innate immune receptor oligomerization initiates inflammatory host responses, including inflammasome
activation. The research outlined in this proposal is designed to mechanistically unravel a novel NLRP3
inflammasome activation concept in human macrophages. We discovered a novel NLRP3 inflammasome
component in human macrophages, which interacts with NLRP3, but is absent from mice and our preliminary
studies revealed that NLRP3 requires this co-sensor for oligomerization as well as for recruiting the
inflammasome adaptor, ASC. Furthermore, NLRP3 and its co-sensor are necessary for efficiently nucleating
ASC polymerization and caspase-1 activation. Knock out of the co-sensor phenocopies NLRP3 knock out in
human macrophages. Significantly, it is absolutely necessary for cytokine release driven by NLRP3 mutations
that cause Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS). We propose two specific aims that investigate
the mechanism and function of the co-sensor in NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation in
macrophages, as well as the molecular events that enable this co-sensor to promote NLRP3 inflammasome
activation. We will utilize CRISPR/Cas9 knock out and restored expression of wild type and mutant co-sensor
proteins and a humanized mouse expressing the human co-sensor for studying its function in vivo.
 We expect that our research will uncover novel molecular mechanisms that not only change our current
understanding of control mechanisms that prevent inappropriate NLRP3 inflammasome activation for
maintaining homeostasis and human health, but also NLRP3-driven pathologies in inflammatory diseases.
The outcomes of our study will move the field forward and will be highly significant for understanding disease
pathologies and for the development of novel therapies that benefit patients and positively affect human health."

Laparoscopic surgery is the standard of care in high-income countries for many cancer operations in the chest
and abdomen. Laparoscopic surgery avoids large incisions by using a tiny camera and fine instruments
manipulated through keyhole incisions, but it is generally unavailable in low- and middle-income countries
(LMICs) due to high cost of installment, lack of qualified maintenance personnel, unreliable electricity
and shortage of consumable items. Patients in LMICs would benefit from laparoscopic surgery, as
advantages include: decreased pain, improved recovery time, fewer wound infections, and shorter hospital
stays. Laparoscopic surgery would reduce recovery time, enabling patients to return to home and work more
quickly, thereby mitigating impoverishing health expenditure.
KeyScope and KeyLoop (collectively called KeySuite) are laparoscopic prototypes that we have
designed for the resources, needs and challenges of LMICs. KeyScope is a laparoscope that can be
made for $150 (cost of goods), plugs into a laptop computer to display images during surgery, exists as a
single unit without complicated assembly and is sterilizable by immersion in Cidex. It links to a tele-mentoring
application so that experienced surgeons can mentor surgeons in capacity-building partnerships. KeyLoop is a
laparoscopic retractor that lifts the abdominal wall during surgery, obviating the need for a constant power
supply and medical-grade carbon dioxide. This would enable laparoscopic surgery to be performed in rural
hospitals, where most patients live in LMICs, and increase access in tertiary centers where laparoscopic
equipment is rare and expensive. We describe a multi-disciplinary collaboration between surgeons,
engineers, oncologists, attorneys, global health experts and business executives to take this technology
to the next stage.
We will perform a clinical First-in-Human study at the Uganda Cancer Institute. Ugandan surgeons will use the
KeySuite devices to perform biopsies of intra-abdominal tumors. Primary outcome will be the ability to perform
biopsies laparoscopically without conversion to open surgery. Secondary outcomes include: 1) device
feasibility and safety data and 2) patient satisfaction.
We will demonstrate that KeySuite devices can be constructed in Uganda, through the Duke-MUK Shipping
Container Makerspace. We will create a bill of materials, manufacturing process instructions, training videos,
and measures of quality control. Once we have achieved exceptional construction quality, we will transfer this
work to the Uganda Industrial Research Institute (UIRI) which will move the KeySuite to a product for
commercialization. Using the WHO Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) we will establish quality assurance
protocols for sustainable local manufacturing and regulatory approval of the KeyScope and KeyLoop through
the Uganda National Drug Authority and CE mark."

Telomeres, the physical ends of linear chromosomes, are composed of short repeating sequences (TTGGGG in
the G-strand for Tetrahymena thermophila and TTAGGG in human) of double-strand DNA with a single-strand
3′ overhang of the G-strand and, in humans, six proteins collectively called shelterin. Of these, TPP1–POT1
associate with the 3′ overhang, where POT1 binds the G-strand and TPP1 functions to recruit telomerase via
interaction with telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). The telomere DNA 3’-ends are replicated and
maintained by telomerase, for the G-strand and subsequently DNA polymerase α–primase (PolαPrim) in
complex with CTC1–STN1–TEN1 (CST), for the C-strand. In Tetrahymena, orthologous proteins p50 (TPP1),
Teb1 (POT1), and CST are constitutively associated with telomerase. Mutations that affect their activity or
regulation have profound effects on human health. Recent cryoEM structures and other studies on Tetrahymena
and human telomerase and these interacting partners set the stage for our goals to illuminate the detailed
mechanism and regulation of G-strand and C-strand synthesis at telomeres. Our focus will be on two broad
aspects of human and Tetrahymena telomerase and telomere structural biology: (A) telomerase mechanism,
assembly, and disease and (B) C-strand synthesis by CST–PolαPrim. Our research approach will primarily
involve complementary applications of cryoEM and NMR spectroscopy along with rigorous biochemistry and
molecular biology. Results on the two organisms will provide complementary information on shared structures
and mechanisms while also providing an evolutionary perspective for divergent organisms. Additionally, (C) we
will extend from single particle cryoEM to cryoET to visualize telomerase at telomeres in situ."
10842171,"The overarching goal of this project is to understand how molecular-scale interactions at cellular adhesion
complexes dictate the organization of cells and tissues. In the first portion of this project, we focus on the
proteins that make up adherens junctions (AJs) and tight junctions (TJs). AJs and TJs link the cytoskeletons of
neighboring cells and allow epithelial tissues to fulfill their essential function as physical barriers, respectively.
Importantly, these complex molecular assemblies are exquisitely responsive to the mechanical forces
generated during embryonic development and tissue repair, and in the context of diseases such as cancer and
heart disease. However, only a few of the protein-protein interactions that make up these adhesion complexes
have been characterized biochemically, and even less is known about the underlying mechanisms by which
these structures respond to mechanical load. This lack of quantitative data presents an unavoidable roadblock
in the collective effort to understand how cells build and remodel multicellular tissues.
 In the past funding period, we used single-molecule biophysical assays to discover multiple unanticipated
mechanisms by which the proteins present in these complexes sense and respond to mechanical force. Here,
we will build on these results to discover the mechanisms by which AJ and TJ proteins may act to seed larger-
scale organization at the cell and tissue levels. Based on strong preliminary data, we will examine how
adhesion complexes templated by αE-catenin and afadin regulate the assembly of multicellular actomyosin
cables that power collective cellular motions during embryonic development and wound healing. Preliminary
data likewise demonstrate that PDZ domains, a widespread class of protein domains that mediate protein-
protein interactions, can exhibit striking forms of mechanosensitivity. Building on this result, we will elucidate
the function of mechanosensitive PDZ-mediated interactions in controlling the assembly and dynamics of TJs,
and work to discover additional forms of force sensing employed by junctional proteins.
 The second portion of this proposal focuses on a class of specialized cellular adhesion complexes that
mediate planar cell polarity (PCP). PCP refers to the long-range, front-back polarization of cells in the tissue
plane. PCP is essential in multiple developmental contexts, and aberrations in PCP signaling are a prevalent
source of birth defects. Previous work shows that the core PCP components assemble into clusters at cell-cell
junctions, with specific proteins asymmetrically localized to opposite sides. The molecular mechanisms that
mediate the induction of this key asymmetry have remained elusive. Here, we will combine the power of
Drosophila genetics with quantitative imaging approaches to test the hypothesis that multivalent protein-protein
interactions within individual clusters lead to a nonlinear increase in asymmetry with cluster size. In total, work
across these two areas will greatly expand our understanding of how the interactions of individual proteins
within cellular adhesion complexes generate the structure and function of cells and tissues."

Perceptual computing (PC), in combination with artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), is poised to
revolutionize clinical approaches to diagnosis, personalized treatment (precision medicine), symptom and out-
come monitoring, telemedicine/mobile health, and primary prevention across a wide range of disorders. PC tools
are rapidly expanding but unresolved ethical and practical challenges stand in the way of responsible translation
into clinical care. These challenges stem from the specific, novel features of PC metrics, which differ from tradi-
tional measures of emotional and social behavior in that they 1) represent objectively observed rather than sub-
jectively elicited states and may involve collection of digital data that patients may not be aware of or wish to
share with their clinicians; 2) collect data passively using digital devices that observe and register moment-to-
moment emotional and behavioral information; 3) yield voluminous material (i.e. “big data”) that is difficult to
scale into actionable information at the individual level; and 4) rest on data easy to collect and make inferences
from, inviting engagement from commercial and other entities whose goals may be profit-driven rather than fidu-
ciary, as in healthcare. To help realize the potential of this technology with widespread clinical impacts, the
objective of this research is to identify and anticipate benefits and concerns (Aim 1); prioritize these concerns
and assess risk/benefit tradeoffs (Aim 2); and evaluate impacts of integrating PC into clinical care (Aim 3). In
Aim 1, we will conduct in-depth interviews with diverse stakeholders (researcher/developers of PC tools intended
to improve healthcare; clinicians across medical specialties; patients; and caregivers) to identify high priority
concerns and information needs for interpreting and integrating PC findings into clinical care. Interview findings
will form the content to be evaluated by expert stakeholders in Aim 2 using a 3-phase modified Delphi. In the
first round, we will conduct a survey entailing Multi-criteria Decision Analysis to confirm and prioritize salient
benefits and potential harms among expert stakeholders. A subset of representative participants (statistically
defined) will be invited to convene in two subsequent rounds, each involving a Decision Conference to review
MCDA results and generate actionable solutions and policy guidelines. In Aim 3, we will collaborate with re-
searchers developing a multimodal PC tool (NIH R01MH125958) to present mental health clinicians with video
and audio recordings of patient intakes involving PC observations in addition to standard intake measures. Cli-
nicians across multiple sites (unaffiliated with NIH R01MH125958) will be asked to provide their best clinical
estimates before and after being presented with PC metrics derived from the audio/video data, and to evaluate
their interpretability, relevance, appropriateness, and acceptability in the context of a cognitive interview. Trian-
gulated results from these aims will contribute concrete insights into what diverse stakeholders need to know in
order to understand and translate PC metrics into actionable clinical knowledge and will contribute to NCAT’s
aims by ensuring the success and predictable impacts of translating PC metrics into clinical care."

The efficient production of small organic molecules and chemical processes impacts pharmaceutical
research, both drug discovery and process chemistry. Chiral compounds make up a substantial portion
of bioactive small organic molecules. Their enantioselective synthesis minimizes use of chiral
separation technology, which can be time and resource intensive, and the production of undesired
enantiomers, which are often considered chemical waste. New copper-catalyzed alkene
difunctionalization reactions that enable efficient and stereoselective synthesis of chiral amine
derivatives and ethers, predominantly saturated heterocycles, are being developed. The products of
these reactions readily map on to structures contained in bioactive organic small molecules such as
natural products and pharmaceuticals. In Objective 1, reactions involving the propagation of chirality,
initiated by enantioselective copper-catalyzed reactions, are being explored. This new synthesis
approach can provide an unconventional, yet streamlined route to complex and potentially bioactive
molecules. In Objective 2, a new synthesis of enantioenriched oxygen heterocycles functionalized with
a pendant carbon-carbon double bond is being explored. Application of this strategy in the efficient
synthesis of bioactive natural products is proposed. One natural product synthesis will complete its
structural assignment, while another will provide an authentic sample for bioactivity profiling. In
Objective 3, our new aerobic enantioselective alkene aminooxygenation reaction will be applied to the
synthesis of drug analogs aimed at increased stability and selectivity in biological settings. In Objective
4, we outline plans to develop a catalytic enantioselective reaction for the synthesis of amine derivatives
with bioactivities related to a range of disease states including cancer and diabetes. Mechanistic
aspects of the reactions developed in Objectives 1-4 will be explored, which will enable their rational
optimization and predictable application. Development of these chemical transformations will enable
their use in in drug discovery and chemical biology applications. Lessons learned in reaction
engineering for efficiency and selectivity should be applicable to the invention and development of
related useful chemical processes. The inclusion of select biochemical analysis of a subset of small
molecules made in this project will give insight into their potential as therapeutic agents."

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has a profound and negative impact on quality of life (QoL).1 Patients with CRS
possess double the rates of depression, worse fatigue, and poorer sleep than control subjects.2,3 CRS is one of
the most common chronic medical conditions worldwide, affecting all age groups. Its incidence is ~12.3% with an
economic burden of greater than $60 billion annually in the US. Despite the substantial burden of CRS, sufficient
treatment options have yet to be identified. While the reasons for developing CRS are incompletely understood,
the underlying morbidity results from inflammation in the sinonasal cavity. Inflammation can be decreased by
topical or systemic corticosteroid which blunt the adaptive immune response. While highly efficacious, systemic
corticosteroids have many negative side effects including osteoporosis, mania, weight gain and hyperglycemia.
To reduce adverse effects, topical intranasal corticosteroid sprays (INCS) are applied directly to the anatomic
region affected while minimizing side effects; however, the efficacy of INCS is limited.
Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) uses numerical methods to solve and analyze problems involving fluid flows.
CFD has been used to help understand nasal airflow, effects of sinus surgery and INCS drug delivery. Current
CFD models of INCS demonstrate that >90% of drug deposition occurs at the very front of the sinonasal cavity
and does not reach the paranasal sinuses. However, we have recently utilized mass spectrophotometry to
quantify INCS deposition in patients undergoing sinonasal surgery and found significant discrepancies between
CFD models in silico and tissue deposition in vivo. This discrepancy between current CFD models and in vivo
measurements is the result of static models that do not account for mucociliary clearance (MCC).
The overall goal of this project is to enhance biomedical research capacity and opportunities for student research
by developing a translational CFD program by creating a partnership between Morgan State University and The
University of North Carolina. We will develop a novel CFD with both particle deposition and MCC in consideration
for the drug absorption in nasal cavity, which will be validated by the in-vivo data for the first time: 1) Develop a
translation CFD research program focused on nasal airflow and drug delivery; 2) Model drug intracellular
absorption of INCS through mucous layer; 3) Model mucociliary clearance mediated drug movement in the nasal
passage. This project will generate one key research deliverable: a robust CFD modeling tool to simulate the
realistic drug absorption process in nasal cavity. Our team’s multidisciplinary approach will expand knowledge of
drug absorption in nasal cavity, using well validated and responsible methodology to meaningfully enhance
investigations in CRS. This project will also enrich the research capabilities in biomedical at Morgan State
University as HBCU, provide high-quality research opportunities to students at HBCU, and contribute significantly
to PI’s career development."

Streptococcus pneumoniae causes over 150,000 hospitalizations annually in the U.S., with a mortality rate of 5-
7%, making the disease both a significant health and financial burden. A key virulence factor during S. pneumoniae
infection is pneumolysin (PLY), a cholesterol dependent cytolysin (CDC) that causes ion flux in host cells through
its ability to form large 400Å pores in host cell membranes. The goal of the proposed research is to elucidate the
role of PLY-dependent ion flux in the disruption of the lung epithelium. Intercellular junctions (IJs) are crucial for
maintaining lung epithelial integrity and include adherens junctions and tight junctions. Our hypothesis is that PLY-
dependent ion flux disrupts adherens junctions (Aim 1) and tight junctions (Aim 2) during S. pneumoniae infection.
We will investigate this hypothesis with an air-liquid-interface (ALI) culture system that generates polarized lung
epithelial monolayers. In Aim 1 we will determine how PLY-dependent ion flux disrupts adherens junction proteins.
To assess PLY-dependent ion flux removal of adherens junction proteins, we will load cells with ion specific
fluorescent indicators, infect with PLY-proficient (WT) or PLY-deficient (∆ply) S. pneumoniae strains, and measure
changes in fluorescence. We will also perform these infections with ion specific chelators to show chelator efficacy
in blocking ion flux. To determine the role of ion flux in adherens junction disruption, we will infect ALI monolayers
with WT or ∆ply S. pneumoniae in the presence or absence of ion specific chelators, stain adherens junctions with
fluorescent antibodies, image monolayers by confocal microscopy, perform image analysis, and use Prism for
statistical analysis. Finally, we will assess if any adherens junction proteins are cleaved as a result of PLY-
dependent ion flux and identify the protease responsible using chemical inhibitors and CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing.
Ion flux caused by pore forming toxins disrupts tight junctions and adherens junctions via shared, but distinct
pathways, Thus, to accurately understand how ion flux disrupts tight junctions, we will evaluate them separately
from adherens junctions. In Aim 2 we will elucidate how PLY-dependent ion flux disrupts tight junction proteins in
an analogous manner to Aim 1. Briefly, we will infect monolayers with WT or ∆ply S. pneumoniae, stain tight junction
proteins, image the monolayers by confocal microscopy, and perform quantitative image and statistical analysis.
In parallel, we will assess if any tight junction proteins are cleaved as a result of PLY-dependent ion flux and identify
the protease responsible using chemical inhibitors and CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing. PLY is one of 20+ CDCs that
share 40-80% homology with each other. To assess if ion flux is a conserved mechanism for CDCs to disrupt tight
junctions we will assess CDC-dependent ion flux as described in Aim 1. We will also treat monolayers with CDCs
and analyze tight junction disruption as described in Aim 2. Collectively, these experiments will elucidate the
mechanism of how PLY disrupts the lung epithelium, a key event for S. pneumoniae dissemination and a conserved
strategy used by many other respiratory pathogens."

 African American (AA) men have an increased risk for both prostate cancer (PCa) incidence and
mortality. Although socio-economic status and other environmental and cultural factors likely contribute to this
racial disparity, emerging evidence has shown an important role of genetic and epigenetic factors in the
pathogenesis of AA PCa.
 Androgens and the androgen receptor (AR)-mediated signaling pathways play a central role in prostate
tumorigenesis. The AR is a ligand-induced transcriptional factor and contains an N-terminal transactivation
domain (NTD). The NTD of human AR possesses polymorphic trinucleotide repeats, CAGs (cytosine, adenine,
guanine), which codes for the polyglutamine (PolyQ) tract. The length of CAG repeats in the human AR gene
has been shown to be inversely correlated with the risk of developing PCa, age of disease onset, and risk of
advanced PCa at diagnosis. Intriguingly, AA men bear shorter CAG repeats significantly more frequently than
Caucasian American (CA) men, linking the length of polyQ tracts to the pathogenesis of PCa in AA men.
Additionally, a significant co-activation of the androgen and Wnt signaling pathways has been revealed in fast
growing and early onset PCa, specifically enriched in AA PCa samples. Moreover, emerging evidence has
shown a niche role of stromal AR to support prostatic epithelial oncogenesis. However, despite these intriguing
findings and past scientific progress, the oncogenic role and related molecular mechanism for AR-mediated
signaling pathways in PCa tumorigenesis, specifically in AA PCa racial disparity, remain elusively. One of the
bottlenecks for these shortfalls is the lack of biologically relevant animal models that can recapitulate aberrant
AR activation in promoting PCa development and progression, mimicking the situation in AA patients. To
directly address this challenge, we propose a series of experiments using our new and relevant animal models,
human PCa samples, single-cell RNA sequencing, and other advanced approaches to directly test our central
hypothesis that aberrant activation of the AR bearing short polyQ tracts in both prostatic epithelia and stroma
promotes PCa initiation, progression, and hormone refractoriness in AA patients. Successful completion of the
proposed study should directly impact the current paradigms and lead to the development of new preventive
and therapeutic strategies to improve clinical outcomes for AA PCa patients."

The incidence of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), the most common type of head and neck cancer,
continues to rise among numerous demographic groups in the US, yet its 5-year survival rate has not improved
for several decades. Despite advances in targeted therapy, immunotherapy and other novel adjuvant regimens,
patients with locoregionally advanced and recurrent/metastatic disease continue to have extremely poor
outcomes, underscoring the need for more effective treatments for OSCC, which often goes undiagnosed until
it has reached late stages. Primary risk factors for OSCC include tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and for
oropharyngeal cancers, HPV infection, but cancer incidence is influenced by additional elements such as
anatomic site, patient demographics, and likely the individual’s oral microbiome. Given that cases of OSCC are
increasing despite targeted head and neck cancer prevention efforts in the US such as smoking cessation and
HPV vaccination, there is a strong rationale for exploring other modifiable risk factors that, together with new
therapies, can improve outcomes for patients with OSCC as well as other aggressive head and neck cancers.
The oral microbiome is a complex and dynamic community of commensal organisms that can become
imbalanced (“dysbiotic”) in response to dietary intake, tobacco and alcohol use, and poor dental hygiene.
Dysbiosis can pre-dispose an individual to oral disease, including cancer, by enriching for bacterial pathogens
that promote carcinogenesis, secrete carcinogenic compounds, and promote chronic inflammation. Thus,
reversing oral dysbiosis is a promising approach for protecting against tumorigenesis. The food additive nisin,
which is bactericidal against a broad range of pathogens, has been shown to restore oral microbiome diversity,
suppress inflammation, and stimulate anti-tumor cellular responses in vitro and in a polymicrobial mouse model
of oral cancer, while maintaining its well-established safety profile. However, the potential clinical benefit of nisin
for treating OSCC in humans has not been investigated. Here, we propose a Phase I/IIa trial to establish the
tolerability and feasibility of administering nisin to OSCC patients who represent high-risk populations. In parallel,
we will perform mechanistic studies of nisin and its effects on oral microbiome community structure,
inflammasome expression, and anti-cancer cellular responses of the study participants. We will also analyze the
emergence of nisin resistance among key oral bacteria, which could provide insight into circumventing nisin
resistance in other clinical contexts. We hypothesize that nisin will be well-tolerated among OSCC patients and
will counter dysbiosis by inhibiting bacterial pathogen growth and promoting an anti-tumorigenic environment via
immunomodulation and anti-cancer cell activity. Our long-term goals are to validate nisin as a promising
candidate for OSCC treatment and demonstrate that oral dysbiosis is a major driver of tumorigenesis in humans
that can be manipulated, thus highlighting the important yet mostly unrecognized protective role that
antimicrobials can exert against cancer in humans."

Exposure to organophosphate (OP) compounds such as diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP)
results in irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), excessive accumulation of
acetylcholine within synapses, and overactivation of muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors in the peripheral and central nervous system, leading to death. Civilian populations
are at risk from OP exposure. Toxic signs (hypersecretions, vomiting, diarrhea, tremors, status
epilepticus [SE], respiratory distress, death) can ensue within minutes of exposure. Current
medical countermeasures are effective acutely but may not prevent long-term consequences. It
is known that OP compounds cause white matter damage in monkeys. In humans, white matter
volume reduction is observed years after exposure as evidenced by survivors of a sarin attack
in a Tokyo subway. Independently, pathologic white matter microstructural alterations, inefficient
connectivity in the limbic system and default mode network (DMN) reductions have been
observed in animal models of induced SE. However, the effect of OP exposure on white matter
microstructure and underlying pathophysiological mechanism(s) are unknown. Our approach
examines pathologic white matter microstructural alterations after DFP exposure. We will use
high resolution diffuse tensor imaging (DTI) to analyze SE-induced deleterious effects. In
addition to determining pathphysiological effects of DFP, we will also perform an intervention.
We will test the anti-excitotoxic and anti-inflammatory efficacy of alpha-linolenic acid (LIN) to
prevent the DFP-induced pathologic white matter microstructural alterations and reduction in the
DMN by employing DTI and functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) on a 7T MRI.
Finally, we will perform target and off-target lipidomics to gain insight into the contributions of
pro- and anti-inflammatory polyunsaturated fatty acid-derived oxylipins in OP-induced white
matter changes. The data acquired in this study will define the pathologic white matter
microstructural alterations and reduction in the DMN after DFP exposure. We will also
understand mechanisms underlying DFP-induced effects. The incorporation of a pharmaco-
intervention may prevent the white matter microstructural damage and DMN reduction after OP
exposure. LIN derived oxyipins may tip the balance toward an anti-inflammatory state in brain to
increase neuronal connectivity function and improve clinical outcome."

Antimicrobial resistance increasingly threatens our ability to effectively treat a wide range of infections. Absent
the development of novel antibiotics, humanity faces the prospect of a return to the pre-antibiotic era with
associated mortality to rival that of cancer. One promising approach for the development of novel antibiotics is
the engineering of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), miniproteins of diverse structural classes made by all
branches of life to defend against microbes. In particular, the engineering of human AMPs presents the
opportunity to leverage both the antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of these AMPs to treat
infections. Under the guidance of mentors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Massachusetts
General Hospital (MGH), and the Broad Institute, the candidate has adapted fast flow chemistry for the rapid
synthesis and engineering of human AMPs, and in this proposal he seeks to extend these efforts through two
aims. Aim 1 defines the structure-activity relationships underlying the mechanisms of gram-negative killing and
phagocyte chemotaxis mediated by three human AMPs of distinct structural types, while Aim 2 extends these
lines of inquiry to the development of derivatives of LL-37 as lead therapeutics. Together, these aims lay the
groundwork for extension of the studies described to additional facets of AMP biology and engineering as well
as preclinical applications as the candidate transitions to independence.
The candidate’s research background consists of doctoral training in innate immunology against retroviral
infection combined with clinical training in infectious diseases. This proposal for a K08 Mentored Clinical
Scientist Research Career Development Award will enable the candidate to complete additional hands-on and
didactic training in protein engineering and omics technologies over a five-year period toward the goal of
establishing an independent, R01-funded research program applying these approaches to the ongoing study
and development of human AMPs as novel antibiotics. In this effort, he is guided by primary mentors with
expertise in protein engineering and mass spectrometry as well as bacterial pathogenesis and genomic
technologies, which is further supported by an advisory board with deep expertise in microbiology,
immunology, proteomics, AMP mechanisms of action, and drug development as well as the extensive
resources of MIT, MGH, and the Broad Institute."

Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are becoming exceptionally popular in the world as an alternative to
conventional cigarettes. Nicotine can induce lipolysis, leading to increased serum free fatty acids (FFAs).
Increased levels of FFAs are one of the key elements in inducing lipotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and
DNA damage. NAD+ homeostasis is regulated by nutrient-sensing signaling and DNA damage response
pathways, which play key roles in metabolism and survival. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases 1 (PARP1) and
Sirtuin-1 have a common co-factor, NAD+. Therefore, increased PARP1 activity can impact Sirtuin-1 activity by
reducing the NAD+ pool. We investigated the effects of acipimox, an antihyperlipidemic drug, on e-cigarettes-
induced cardiac dysfunction. C57BL/6J wild-type mice on high fat diet were exposed to saline, e-cigarettes with
nicotine (2.4%) [e-cig(2.4%)], e-cigarette (2.4%) plus acipimox, for 12 weeks. Fractional shortening and ejection
fraction was decreased in mice exposed to e-cig(2.4%) compared with saline and acipimox. Therefore, acipimox
rescued the e-cigarette-induced cardiac dysfunction. Transcriptomic evaluation with Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis revealed that e-cigarette-treated mice had genes enriched in the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint
pathways. These changes were normalized by acipimox. Mice exposed to e-cigarettes have increased circulating
levels of inflammatory cytokines, and FFAs which were regularized by acipimox. Moreover, mice exposed to e-
cig(2.4%) had increased apurinic/apyrimidinic sites and PARP1 activity. These manifestations of DNA damage
were normalized by acipimox. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that PJ34, a potent inhibitor of PARP proteins,
reverses oxidative stress, mitochondrial abnormalities, and cardiac dysfunction induced by e-cigarettes. Aim 2
will elucidate if genetically increasing SIRT1 levels in cardiomyocytes can prevent the development of e-
cigarette-induced cardiac dysfunction. Aim 3 will assess the role of lipolysis on e-cigarette-induced cardiac
dysfunction with an inhibitor of adipose triglyceride lipase, atglistatin. PARP1 pathway might be a useful
therapeutic target to counteract the detrimental cardiac effects of e-cigarettes. Understanding the consequences
of e-cigarettes use on cardiac dysfunction and DNA damage response is directly relevant to the development of
policies related to tobacco use. As an R16 application, this project will strengthen the research environment at
Charles Drew University, a predominantly disadvantaged minority-serving Institution in the South Los Angeles
Area.

The Overall Goal of this application is to identify shared, conserved mechanisms that induce
precancerous lesions like metaplasia. Our preliminary and published data indicate that pseudopyloric or so-
called SPEM-type metaplasia in stomach is the manifestation of a conserved regeneration program induced by
large-scale injury. The metaplastic cells themselves are characterized by a “dedifferentiated” phenotype wherein
they express embryonic-like or early developmental markers that proliferate to repair the tissue damage. We
hypothesize that the metaplastic/regenerative process is fueled by expansion of a population of embryonic-like
progenitor cells (EPCs). EPCs arise in large part from mature secretory that become progenitor-like by following
a stepwise, conserved cellular program we call “paligenosis”.
Here, we will show preliminary data that Hippo signaling via Nf2 (Merlin) and downstream transcription factors
YAP1/TAZ may be a critical, conserved modulator of EPC expansion. In Aim 1, we will test necessity/sufficiency
of Nf2 and Yap1/Taz in gastric metaplasia in mouse models and in human and mouse organoids. We will perform
discovery based RNA-Seq experiments to uncover new Hippo targets modulating EPCs and metaplasia. In Aim
2 we will look at how these Hippo pathway components interact with the stages of paligenosis we have
characterized, whether they can overcome molecular checkpoints between Stages 1 and 2 and between 2 and
3. We will also determine how Hippo signaling interacts with the conserved, paligenosis-dedicated gene Ifrd1,
which we will show is required to suppress p53 as cells upregulate mTORC1 to reenter the cell cycle in Stage 3
paligenosis. In Aim 3, we will test whether increasing EPC formation and metaplasia via the Hippo pathway
increases tumorigenesis by combining Hippo mutants with: 1) the mutagen MNU; or 2) additional gastric-cancer-
related mutant alleles p53 and Cdh1; or 3) by increasing chronic inflammation with the human gastric-cancer-
predisposing bacterium H pylori.
Experiments were designed to be appropriately powered in collaboration with our biostatistician, Dr. Yan Yan.
State-of-the-art imaging (eg. AiryScan live-cell, confocal on organoids; FIB-SEM 3-D ultrastructural
nanotomography) will be performed with Dr. James Fitzpatrick in our institutional imaging core; organoid support,
and gene editing will be in collaboration with Dr. Blair Madison and our shared organoid core; bioinformatic
analysis including synergy with data repositories will be via our collaboration with Dr. Bo Zhang, who directs the
institutional bioinformatics core for the Center for Regenerative Medicine."
10852885,"Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) statistics over the years have repeatedly shown that while BC incidence is
higher in Caucasian (CA) women, death due to BC is higher in African American (AA) women. Importantly, AA
patients are more likely to be diagnosed of BC at a younger age and have a higher probability of developing
aggressive triple negative (TN) BC. AA TNBC is also diagnosed with a more advanced stage of the disease
compared to CA women. This project plans to address the differential mitochondrial reprogramming between
AA and CA TNBC patients. Considering our previous publication and preliminary data, here we use modulation
in the activation of Src oncopathway as a major readout of metabolic reprogramming. We have previously
showed that TNBC cells have high energy dependency to fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) and FAO is an important
determinant of Src activation by autophosphorylation at its Y419 site. However, our recent analyses suggest
that this dependency is mostly restricted to CA TNBC. AA TNBC cells are not responding to FAO inhibitors as
observed with most of the CA TNBC, and FAO inhibitors do not decrease Src autophosphorylation in AA
TNBC. Further analysis suggest that, even though Src depends on Krebs cycle (TCA) activity in both AA and
CA TNBC cells, the source of acetyl-CoA for TCA is significantly different between these two groups. Thus, this
project is planning to address the disparity in energy dependency between AA and CA TNBC tumors. Our
preliminary data also suggest that increased Myc, pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and argininosuccinate synthase
1 (ASS1) activities in AA TNBC are critical in their enhanced arginine pathway. We have also proposed a
translational aim to understand the role of TCA inhibitors in the therapeutic response of AA TNBC to Src
inhibitors. Thus, this project will provide critical information regarding the energy dependency and onco-
pathway activation in AA TNBC. The project involves experiments utilizing several AA and CA TNBC cell lines,
patient-derived xenografts (PDX) models as well as deidentified BC tissues obtained from AA and CA TNBC
patients. This project also involves genomic, proteomic, metabolomic, bioinformatic and clinical approaches
including in vivo studies in animal models. Overall, this study will provide an important scientific mechanism
behind the racial disparity of energy dependency and regulation of onco-pathways in AA TNBC patients. The
outcome can support in the development of race-specific combination therapies for the management of
aggressive TNBC."

 Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias (ADRD) not only exact a heavy
toll on patients, they also impose an enormous emotional, physical, and financial burden on unpaid, often
family, caregivers. The strain of providing care for a loved one diagnosed with AD, often across several years,
is associated with elevated depression risk and poorer overall health. Existing cognitive and behavioral
intervention approaches for ADRD unpaid primary caregivers operate via biobehavioral mechanisms that
remain to be clarified. In addition, existing interventions target many components and strategies
simultaneously, making inferences about the effectiveness of particular strategies difficult to draw, and involve
substantial time/cost burdens. Emotion regulation skills represent an ideal target for psychological intervention
to promote healthy coping in ADRD caregivers. The proposed research seeks to use an experimental medicine
approach to test the efficacy and biobehavioral mechanisms of a novel, relatively brief, targeted, scalable,
entirely smartphone-based cognitive emotion regulation intervention aimed at improving psychological
outcomes (i.e., reducing perceived stress, caregiver burden, and depressive symptoms) in ADRD unpaid
primary caregivers as well as examine potential benefits of the caregiver intervention on quality of life in care
recipients. Cognitive reappraisal (i.e., the ability to modify the trajectory of an emotional response by thinking
about and appraising emotional information in an alternative, more adaptive way) represents a highly
promising target for psychological intervention in ADRD caregivers. Reappraisal can be operationalized via two
primary tactics: psychological distancing (i.e. appraising an emotional stimulus as an objective, impartial
observer) and reinterpretation (i.e., imagining a better outcome than what initially seemed apparent). The
proposed project builds upon promising preliminary work to investigate the efficacy and underlying
biobehavioral mechanisms of a novel, one-week cognitive reappraisal intervention in this population, with
follow-up assessments at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 3 months. ADRD unpaid primary caregivers will be randomly
assigned to receive training in either distancing, reinterpretation, or a no regulation natural history control
condition, with ecological momentary assessments of self-reported positive and negative affect, remotely-
collected psychophysiological health-related biomarkers (i.e., heart rate variability data measured using
smartphone-based photoplethysmography), and health-related questionnaire reports. The proposed study
aims to mechanistically relate changes in psychological and psychophysiological function to prediction of
health-relevant behavioral outcomes during a novel emotion regulation intervention never before implemented
in this stressed, high risk group."

One in two adults in the U.S. have at least one cardiometabolic disease (CMD) including hypertension, heart
disease diabetes or stroke. Despite links between short sleep duration and cardiometabolic health, few
studies have sought to improve CMD risk by extending sleep. A promising area of research is sleep extension
interventions. To date, several small studies have demonstrated short term improvements in sleep and CMD
risk factors such as blood pressure and glycemic control. However, these studies are limited by their short
term design and viewing sleep extension as an experimental manipulation rather than a sustainable behavior
change. In this study, we are proposing to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test our behavioral sleep
extension intervention compared to a health education control group on sleep and CMD risk factors among
adults with prehypertension/stage I hypertension. The sleep extension intervention is based on 3 well
established behavior change principles: self-monitoring (wearable sleep tracker), education (email content)
and motivational enhancement (brief telephone coaching). During this 12 month study, we will include an
intervention period (weeks 1-8, weekly intervention), maintenance period (months 2-6, monthly intervention)
and follow-up period (no intervention). The primary outcome for this study will be sleep duration and the main
secondary outcome will be 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, which allows us to evaluate both
daytime and nighttime blood pressures in daily life. The evaluation of sleep duration changes of 12-months
will allow us to test the efficacy of our behavioral sleep extension intervention on acute and sustained
changes in sleep duration and CMD risk factors as well as important psychological, behavioral and
physiological mediators such as self-reported sleepiness, BMI, diet, physical activity, glycemic control and
inflammation. Successful completion of this study will provide critical information about the impact of
behavioral sleep extension on important measures of health and quality of life needed to incorporate sleep
extension into CMD risk interventions, such as diet and physical activity programs. The long-term goal of this
research is to develop, test and disseminate effective and scalable sleep interventions to reduce chronic
disease risk and improve disease management."

This proposal represents the renewal application of the Pediatric Oncology Clinical Research Training Program
(POCRTP), developed by Texas Children’s Cancer Center (TCCC), which is jointly supported by Baylor College
of Medicine’s (BCM) Department of Pediatrics and Texas Children’s Hospital (TCH). The POCRTP is a
comprehensive, multidisciplinary, clinical research education program to train pediatric clinical oncology faculty
to design, implement, conduct, and analyze clinical research trials. Clinical research is essential to advancing
the treatment of childhood cancer; however, clinical fellowships do not provide sufficient training in this area. The
POCRTP emphasizes a team science approach in which laboratory and clinical scientists interact to expedite
the translation of basic research discoveries into clinical therapeutic cancer research. Eligible Scholars must
have completed pediatric hematology-oncology fellowship training and be board-eligible or certified. POCRTP
Scholars receive three years of training that includes core didactics in clinical investigation and trial design and
an in-depth laboratory and clinical research experience focused in one Clinical Research Pathway: Immunology
and Cell Therapy; Genomics and Precision Medicine; or Epidemiology and Survivorship. Scholars are mentored
by both a laboratory and a clinical research mentor, and receive extensive instruction in clinical trial design,
statistical analysis, research ethics, regulatory requirements, scientific writing, grantsmanship, and leadership.
Scholars also participate in BCM’s Institutional Review Board and attend national workshops. Scholars are
expected to publish at least one peer-reviewed manuscript related to their project, develop a peer-reviewed grant
application, and develop and conduct a clinical trial in which they serve as Chair or co-Chair. Since its inception
in 2001, the POCRTP has successfully trained 30 Scholars, the majority of whom are actively involved in
pediatric oncology clinical research. There are currently six Scholars participating in the POCRTP; two Scholars
will complete the Program this summer, and one Scholar will begin in July 2021. For the next funding cycle, we
are proposing several new features to enhance the Scholar’s training and professional development, including
a multi-PI leadership plan whereby Dr. Susan Blaney and Dr. Carl Allen will be co-Leaders of the POCRTP.
Additional features include a formal Research Mentorship Education Program, as well as a required Scholarship
Oversight Committee and formal Individual Development Plan. We are also actively working to enhance the
recruitment of Scholars who are from groups underrepresented in medicine and have recruited additional faculty
mentors to expand the range of scientific expertise, as well as racial and ethnic diversity of the Program."

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is of major public health importance because of increasing prevalence, and high lifetime
risk, costs, morbidity, and mortality. Current AF therapies have partial efficacy, moderate adherence, high cost,
and substantial morbidity. Hence, there is a profound need to develop a more comprehensive understanding of
the etiology of AF to identify individuals at risk for AF and novel drug targets for AF therapies.
 In 2008, we organized the AFGen Consortium (AFGen) and since that time our highly collaborative,
international consortium has led the field of AF genetics. We have described the vast majority of the more than
130 genetic loci that have been associated with AF. To complement our genome wide association data, we
also have led efforts to perform whole exome (WES) and genome sequencing (WGS) in individuals with AF.
We have identified loss of function variants in the sarcomeric protein, titin, that are significantly associated with
early-onset AF.
 In our competitive renewal application, we now seek to extend our prior work in 4 directions. In Aim 1, we
propose to conduct one of the largest disease-based analyses of WES and WGS data. In aggregate we will
include over 91K AF cases and 769K controls from the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine program,
the NHGRI Center for Common Disease Genomics program, the UK Biobank, 5 clinical trials from the TIMI
Study, and the All of Us Program. Our primary analysis will be focused on the identification of AF associated
genes. We will then take advantage of this multi-ancestry data to a) fine map loci to identify causal variants, b)
develop polygenic risk scores that identify individuals at high risk across ancestries, and c) use Mendelian
Randomization to assess both causal effects of risk factors on AF, and AF on heart failure and stroke. In Aim
2, we propose to use deep learning models to reconstruct left atrial (LA) size and function in the United
Kingdom Biobank cardiac MRI imaging data in 100K individuals. In preliminary studies, we have derived
measurements for 7 LA traits, identified more than 20 genetic loci associated with LA traits, and co-localized
LA and AF risk genes. In Aim 3, we propose to validate the top 50 AF and LA associated genes by performing
gene perturbation assays in stem cell derived atrial cardiomyocytes. We will perform gene knockouts or over
expression followed by assays of myocyte structure and electrophysiology using high content imaging. Finally,
in Aim 4, we will support the ongoing efforts of the AFGen Consortium and continuing training of early-stage
investigators in a virtual fellowship.
 We believe that our multidisciplinary team brings together extraordinary expertise in AF genetics,
epidemiology, bioinformatics, biostatistics, and basic cardiovascular research. Ultimately, we anticipate that our
work will provide novel targets for the risk stratification, prevention, and treatment of AF."

Bone is a favored organ for the secondary growth from prostate cancer (PCa). Metastatic PCa is lethal and the
mechanisms that drive its progression in the skeleton and contribute to the evasion of therapy are not
understood. It has been recognized that interplay of PCa cells with the bone microenvironment is one of the key
factors responsible for the adaptive pro-survival signaling in the metastatic tumor. Our own preliminary data
show that in the fat cell-rich environments such as bone marrow, bi-directional cross-talk between metastatic
tumor cells and fat cells results in key metabolic changes in both cell types, ultimately affecting tumor growth,
survival and response to therapy. The key consequences of this cancer cell-initiated paracrine crosstalk are 1)
altered oligomerization and activity of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2); 2) enhanced transcription of interleukin 1b
(IL-1b) ; and 3) tumor survival-promoting changes in the mitochondrial iron metabolism. Our central
hypothesis is that: tumor cell-adipocyte interactions enhance metastatic progression, while simultaneously
reducing response to current treatments, by co-opting enzymatic and transcriptional activities of PKM2 and
IL1b-mediated regulation of iron metabolism.
We propose a multi-faceted approach that includes mouse models of lipolysis, 3D culture techniques, patient
samples and PDX models, as well as state-of-the-art proteomics and RNAseq approaches to examine previously
unexplored mechanisms linking lipolysis with PKM2/IL1β-mediated survival. We will perform these studies in
three Aims. In Aim 1 we will conditionally delete adipocyte triglyceride lipase (ATGL) in adipocytes and study the
molecular mechanisms of lipolysis on tumor progression in bone and response to docetaxel. In Aim 2 we will
focus on lipid-mediated effects on PKM2 oligomerization. We will use proteomics approaches to map S-acylation
sites on PKM2 and determine how this lipid modification regulates protein kinase activity and the
phosphoproteome of the tumor to support growth and progression. In Aim 3 we will examine transcriptional
targets of PKM2/IL-1b axis and its role in regulation of mitochondrial iron metabolism in PCa cells upon
adipocyte exposure. Together, these aims provide independently valuable and novel information into the
biology of bone marrow adipose tissue and its functional role in regulating the bone tumor microenvironment
and metastatic progression. Our work will reveal new mechanisms of tumor adaptation and survival in bone
and identify novel, mechanistic targets for therapy."

community amongst themselves through social activities; receive training in laboratory safety, responsible
conduct of research, and ethics in genomics research; and attend a poster session to meet the faculty mentors
and learn about available research projects. Weeks 2-7 will consist of two-week rotations in three labs chosen
by the scholar. Each scholar will then be paired with an interdisciplinary co-mentorship team, consisting of one
faculty member in the biomedical sciences who will be responsible for providing a genomics dataset and one
faculty member in computational biology who will supervise the bioinformatics analysis. The scholar, under the
guidance of the mentors, will develop an appropriate research plan involving genomics data analysis that can
be completed within ten months and have a high likelihood of contributing to a publication. Following a needs
assessment, individual development plans (IDP) will be prepared by each scholar in consultation with program
advisors and the co-mentor team to guide the scholar’s training program. The IDP will be reviewed monthly to
assess the scholar’s progress toward their program goals. Professional enrichment activities include practice in
scientific writing and both oral and poster presentations. A seminar series featuring invited speakers from
academia, industry, and healthcare institutions will highlight possible career opportunities in genomics data
science. INGEN4DS scholars will receive stipends for their research efforts during the summer (40 hrs/week),
fall and spring semesters (15 hrs/week), and travel funds to attend one scientific conference to present their
findings. Additionally, the scholars will receive ongoing support including individualized advising, career
development, and assistance in preparing resumes and applications. In the final month of the program,
scholars will prepare a written report and a short oral presentation of their findings. Our expectation is that over
75% of the scholars will secure employment in the genomics workforce or be accepted to a PhD program in
Bioinformatics or a Genomics field. Further, we expect that the scholars will have gained real-world experience
in large-scale genomics data analysis using advanced data sciences methodology and computing resources
and will have achieved effective communication skills necessary for working in interdisciplinary genomics
research groups."

Despite much progress, alcoholic liver disease (ALD) remains a major health problem worldwide. The
disease process is characterized by early steatosis, steatohepatitis, with some individuals ultimately
progressing to fibrosis/cirrhosis and liver failure. Unfortunately, there is currently no accepted therapies
available to halt or reverse this process in humans. Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) catalyzes
SAM-dependent degradation of nicotinamide, a predominant precursor for cellular NAD+ biosynthesis via
a salvage pathway. SAM (s-adenosylmethionine) is the first product of methionine metabolism and a
universal methyl donor in cellular transmethylation reactions. The critical role of NNNT in regulating both
NAD+ and SAM homeostasis make it an emerging novel metabolic regulator. We are the first to report
that the liver ATF4 transactivation plays a mechanistic role in mediating NNMT upregulation in the setting
of chronic alcohol consumption and adenoviral shRNA knockdown of NNMT is protective against
alcoholic fatty liver development, suggesting that NNMT can be an ideal therapeutic choice for ALD
treatment. The preliminary data recently obtained from our laboratory uncovered that NNMT inhibition
was associated with improved mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) and blunted hepatic
PPAR-gamma activation upon chronic alcohol exposure. In this proposal, we will further elucidate the
mechanistic implication of NNMT in the pathogenesis of ALD. Successful performance of the studies
proposed in this proposal will not only shed new light on the pathogenesis of this disease, but also pave
the way for novel therapeutic interventions for ALD. The three aims are included in this proposal to test
our hypothesis: AIM 1: To delineate mechanism(s) underlying NNMT-associated liver pathologies in ALD.
Both animal and cell culture studies will be conducted to elucidate mechanism by which NNMT inhibition
improves UPRmt elicitation in the liver and to determine the mechanism whereby NNMT upregulation
contributes alcohol-induced liver PPAR-gamma activation. AIM 2: To elucidate mechanism(s) by which
chronic alcohol consumption leads to hepatic ATF4 activation and NNMT upregulation. Both hepatocyte-
specific Gcn2 knockout mice and hepatocyte-specific arginase-1 overexpressing mice will be fed with
isocaloric control or alcohol-diet for 5 weeks. Targeted metabolomics will be conducted to using primary
hepatocytes to quantify the effects of alcohol on hepatic arginine metabolism. AIM 3: To determine both
preventive (the pathogenic role) and therapeutic potential of NNMT-targeting approach for ALD. Animals
with liver-specific NNMT knockout will be exposed to either isocaloric control or alcohol-diet. Both
preventive and therapeutic efficacy of NNMT inhibition for ALD will be evaluated."

This new revised T32 application seeks support for the University of Michigan (UM) Predoctoral Genetics
Training Program (GTP). The GTP mission will be to: (i) train a diverse cohort of outstanding Ph.D. and
M.D./Ph.D. scholars conducting dissertation research with a strong genetic component; (ii) enhance Ph.D.
training by providing an innovative curriculum that familiarizes trainees with all aspects of modern genetic
research; and (iii) implement programs that prepare trainees for exciting, inter-disciplinary career opportunities.
A unique aspect of the redesigned training program is the development of a customized GTP curriculum and the
inclusion of trainees and faculty from six basic science departments that span the UM Medical School (Med) and
College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA). The six participating GTP Departments include: Biological
Chemistry (Med); Ecology & Evolutionary Biology (LSA); Human Genetics (Med); Microbiology & Immunology
(Med); Molecular, Cellular, & Developmental Biology (LSA); and Pharmacology (Med). The GTP will continuously
incorporate improvements to ensure that graduate trainees achieve competency in a broad range of modern
genetic research, including computational genetics and the handling of “big data,” which permeates scientific
research. Other GTP-specific program activities will include: (a) innovative improvements to didactic coursework
and discussion-based learning activities; (b) emphasizing the critical importance of ethical conduct in science
and the necessity of conducting rigorous experiments that yield robust and reproducible results; (c) the
establishment of mechanisms to formally train GTP faculty in mentoring; and (d) the creation of initiatives that
will expose GTP trainees to the many career opportunities available to Ph.D. graduates with training in genetics.
To measure success, we will implement a careful plan to assess genetic competencies continually and
quantitatively throughout the span of graduate training. Finally, the establishment of a new diversity, equity, and
inclusion leadership position will enhance our efforts to actively recruit under-represented minority (URM) faculty
and students from varied scientific disciplines. By soliciting regular trainee and faculty feedback--and through
thoughtful discussions with our outstanding internal and external advisory committees--the GTP leadership will
challenge themselves to identify opportunities for curriculum improvements. The UM Medical School, Rackham
Graduate School, and Department of Human Genetics (the GTP administrative home) will provide additional
funds to support the GTP academic mission. In sum, the GTP will be in a strong position to train the next
generation of genetics professionals to address cutting-edge questions in genetics to benefit society. Based on
the outstanding promise of this program, we respectfully request support for 14 GTP training slots per year."
10847543,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Redox imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) (high ROS and
low nitric oxide NO) is a fundamental mechanism of endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction and a driver of
cardiovascular diseases (CVD) such as atherosclerosis, hypertension and peripheral arterial disease (PAD).
Strategies to individually mitigate ROS or amplify NO have experienced limited success. Therefore, a greater
understanding of the key factors and events that lead to redox imbalance is therefore essential to develop more
effective treatments for cardiovascular disease (classical concept) which remains the leading cause of morbidity
and mortality. In ECs, aerobic glycolysis (“Warburg effect”) has been regarded as the dominant metabolic
pathway supporting homeostatic functions. An emerging concept is that the pathways of cellular metabolism are
not fixed, and that ECs can alter their metabolic pathways or “reprogram” to meet different needs. A major gap
in our knowledge is how EC metabolism and ROS/RNS balance are altered in vascular disease and how
metabolism informs function. Recent studies have shown that aerobic glycolysis is increased in ECs of
atherosclerotic, diabetic and angiogenic blood vessels, however, the functional consequences of this dynamic
has yet to be elucidated. Enzymes that produce ROS are not only influenced by metabolism, but may also
promote changes in metabolism. Our preliminary data advance the novel hypothesis that imbalance between
changes in EC metabolism and ROS/RNS (redox balance), induced by various risk factors, is a key driver
of EC dysfunction and an underlying mechanism of vascular disease. To test this hypothesis, a
programmatic approach is essential as it is the only mechanism capable of supporting the rigor needed to
investigate the complex interplay between metabolism and redox signaling in different vascular beds and disease
states. Our program has 3 well aligned projects that benefit from the synergy of model and reagent sharing and
dedicated cores. Project 1 is focused on the hypothesis that disturbed copper (Cu) metabolism in ECs arises
from dysfunction of the Cu exporter, ATP7A, leading to excessive PFKFB3/glycolysis, ROS/NO imbalance and
mitochondrial ROS-epigenetic remodeling that drives EndMT and accelerated atherosclerosis. Project 2 will test
the hypothesis that EC metabolism shapes EC function via sex-specific, Nox1 and leptin-dependent mechanisms.
Project 3 tests the hypothesis that ability of the mitochondrial dynamics protein, Drp1, to promote reparative
angiogenesis via crosstalk between EC mitochondrial redox signaling and glycolysis is impaired in diabetes due
to excess PFKFB3/glycolysis-ROS signaling which increases the severity of PAD. To test these concepts directly,
we have developed a state-of-the-art approach using CRISPR/Cas9 to generate knock-in mice enabling
inducible reduction of glycolysis only in ECs, that will be shared across projects to enhance synergy.
Our Program will identify key mechanisms through which changes in metabolism impact ROS/NO balance, EC
function and vascular disease."

Rare variants with large effects provide excellent opportunities to characterize causal mechanisms for complex
disorders. Recently, large-scale exome sequencing of schizophrenia found that rare protein-truncating and
missense variants in SET Domain Containing 1A (SETD1A) are associated with approximately 4- to 20-fold
increased risk for schizophrenia, making this the top risk gene (P = 2.0e-12) among about ten genes with strong
support. SETD1A encodes a chromatin modifying enzyme responsible for tri-methylation of lysine 4 on the
histone 3 tail (H3K4me3), an important histone modification at active promoters. Characterizing the effects of
SETD1A variants has emerged as one of the most exciting prospects to understand causal mechanisms
underlying risk for schizophrenia. However, interrogating these effects has been hindered by two critical
obstacles: First, since SETD1A variants are very rare, it has been difficult to ascertain sufficient numbers of
carriers to fully characterize SETD1A’s clinical phenotype. Second, in part for the same reason, there have been
no studies of naturally occurring SETD1A variants in human neural cells. Here, we propose experiments to
overcome both of these obstacles, leveraging our discovery of seven deleterious, nonsynonymous SETD1A
variants enriched in a locally accessible founder population, the Old Order Amish. We will recruit a total of 128
Amish carriers of SETD1A variants and their blood relatives, ascertain deep cognitive and psychiatric symptom
phenotypes, and test hypotheses regarding allelic heterogeneity, allele frequency dependence, dose
dependence, and interactions with polygenic risk from common variants. Next, we will obtain induced pluripotent
stem cells from a subset of these individuals to identify cellular and neurodevelopmental phenotypes,
characterize allelic heterogeneity at a cellular level, and test the hypothesis that cellular phenotypes can be
rescued by restoring levels of H3K4me3. Finally, we will test the hypothesis that SETD1A variants alter the
chromatin potential of developing neurons, using cutting-edge single-cell multi-omic technologies and network
modeling techniques. Our exciting preliminary results demonstrate that Amish-enriched SETD1A variants are
associated with increased risk for psychosis, cognitive deficits, reduced cellular proliferation, increased
vulnerability to DNA damage, inefficient formation of neural rosettes, deficits in neurite outgrowth, and
transcriptional signatures of premature cell cycle exit and premature maturation in neural stem cells."

We propose to purchase a new Iconeus One functional ultrasound (fUS) neuroimaging system from the
company, Iconeus, to enhance the biomedical ultrasound and neuroimaging capabilities of the Imaging Research
Core of Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). The fUS system offers unique capabilities in the
neuroimaging space, which are currently unmet by any other instrument. More specifically, fUS fills a critical gap
between functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and standard
small animal optical imaging methods by providing a method of acquiring ultra-fast (1 Mhz), high-resolution (<50
micron spatial resolution) data, which is highly sensitive to changes in cerebral blood volume and vascular
morphology. The main points of distinction of the fUS system from fMRI are 1) the ability to acquire at an
unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution changes of brain vasculature and cerebral blood flow in awake,
mobile mice and rats; 2) a mobile, plug-and-play platform that can be relocated easily, if need be, to the site of
an experiment; and 3) substantially lower cost and greater accessibility compared to an fMRI scanner. Moreover,
it does not require the high maintenance costs of an MRI. Acquisition of this system would add value and advance
numerous ongoing projects in brain imaging, neural engineering, deep brain stimulation, neurodegenerative
diseases, pain, and development of theranostics for neuro-oncology applications. The fUS system would be the
first of its kind in the greater Cleveland area and would enable investigators from CWRU and the surrounding
four clinical affiliates (the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Louis
Stokes Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and The MetroHealth System) to carry out
cutting edge research in these very important fields. This new preclinical fUS capability will also be available to
all regional investigators. A highly interdisciplinary group of 16 Major Users from all these institutions will work
on collaborative projects using the Iconeus One. Ultimately, our goal in acquiring this advanced neuroimaging
technology is to better visualize, design, evaluate, and translate treatments for neurological disorders. An
advisory committee of highly experienced ultrasound and neuroimaging faculty at CWRU and external
institutions will oversee the organization and usage of the system and recommend policies to maintain system
performance and maximize utilization. These advancements will drive our research forward and ultimately
improve human health."

 The overarching goal of this collaborative and translational research on hepatitis B (HBV) is to discover a safe
and effective long-acting antiviral (ARV) therapy that can provide sustained viral suppression. The current daily
and chronic oral antiviral dosing for HBV patients causes pill fatigue and leads to fluctuating drug levels. Both
aspects lead to viral rebound and increases the risk of liver cancer. The introduction of Cabenuva, a long-acting
HIV drug product containing two injectables (cabotegravir and rilpivirine two different products used in
combination), has been a game-changer for the AIDS community, addressing pill fatigue and other barriers.
However, patients co-infected with HBV and HIV are not benefiting fully from this long-acting HIV therapy. To
mitigate the risk of HBV rebound and progression to cirrhosis and/or liver cancer, there is an urgent need for a
long-acting HBV product that can provide sustained viral suppression, alleviate pill fatigue, and ensure consistent
antiviral coverage for both people with HBV and HBV-HIV.
 The proposed translational research aims to leverage the expertise and collaborative capacity of the investigative
team to transform current best, oral antiviral drugs that is short acting into a long-acting HBV therapy. With
extensive resources and a proven track record in preclinical and clinical antiviral research and product translation,
our goal is to identify a lead and backup product candidate suitable as monthly self-injectable long-acting HBV
therapy. The intent of the HBV therapeutic candidate it is for use alone or in combination with existing long-acting
HIV therapies like Cabenuva. The proposed approach utilizes a well-established platform technology to develop
innovative and new long-acting anti-HBV products, with the potential to achieve longer-lasting viral suppression
and improve HBV therapeutic outcomes.
 Our research plan incorporates a set of success matrices and aims based on a defined target product profile
(TPP), with guidance from an external scientific advisory board (SAB). The research aims are: (1) identifying lead
and backup antiviral compositions and processes through molecular-level drug-lipid (excipient) interaction studies
to define the characteristics of long-acting products, (2) evaluating and defining pharmacokinetic profiles of long-
acting dosage forms in vivo to identify lead and backup candidates, (3) identifying preferred user characteristics for
long-acting HBV therapy among people living with HBV, and (4) verifying antiviral activity through dose-response
pharmacokinetic evaluation in a primate model and a woodchuck hepatitis model.
 This five-year translational research progress from in vitro drug-lipid interaction studies to the evaluation and
selection of a lead and backup long-acting anti-HBV therapy for preclinical and clinical development. The study
results will inform early discussions with the FDA and the FDA guidance received will serve as the foundation for
seeking NIH to support the manufacturing of GMP materials and GLP toxicokinetic studies, thereby advancing our
overarching goal of developing a novel long-acting HBV therapy for individuals living with HBV."

My career goal is to become an independent investigator and educator who studies structure-function
mechanisms of tendon aging and injury and how they may be improved using biomaterials. My research training
in bioengineering started by studying the role of healing and fatigue loading on multiscale tendon properties. I
realized that knowledge of biomaterials and therapeutic delivery strategies would be essential to develop
treatments for tendon. During my F32 postdoctoral training, we have developed and explored the capacity of
tough adhesive biomaterials, inspired by the mucus secreted by slugs, to adhere strongly to tendon surfaces.
The goal of this tough adhesive biomaterial is to provide mechanical support and a template for tendon
regeneration, serve as a depot for local delivery of agents, support cell growth and infiltration, and provide gliding
of surrounding tissues. This K99/R00 Application examines a new cell delivery strategy to dynamically recruit
cells in vivo, expand them, and release them on-demand to promote tendon healing using this biomaterial
platform. My mentoring team consists of Dr. David Mooney (primary mentor) and seven other renowned
scientists specializing in tendon developmental and aging biology, musculoskeletal biology, drug delivery,
orthopaedic bioengineering, materials science, and orthopaedic surgery. They provide me with an exceptional
environment to investigate these questions and develop the necessary skills to contribute to the field as an
independent investigator. We hypothesize that this biomaterial system can be tuned to recruit, expand, and
deliver tendon cells (using tough adhesive hydrogels) and augment tendon properties during aging and injury.
This hypothesis will be tested with the following aims: (1) develop and examine the ability of tough hydrogels
containing chemotactic agents to recruit tendon-derived cells, promote their proliferation, and increase
expression of tendon markers throughout aging and injury in vitro and in vivo; (2) develop and examine the ability
of hydrogel degradation and embedded fibers to template mature tendon, drive expression of tendon markers,
and promote cell release from the scaffold to the injury site throughout aging and injury, in vitro and in vivo; and
(3) investigate the ability of the tough adhesive hydrogel system to restore age-related deficits in tendon
homeostasis and healing using a clinically-relevant Achilles tendon rodent model. Success would have a
dramatic impact on individuals suffering from tendon dysfunction following injury and could contribute to the
development of on-demand therapeutics for other musculoskeletal and connective tissue diseases. Overall, this
comprehensive project and training plan will provide me outstanding training to develop the technical and
professional skills necessary to establish a successful and independent research program to study and provide
mentoring in musculoskeletal tissue aging and biomaterials."
10851202,"Project Summary/Abstract
Organophosphate (OP) nerve agents (OPNA) are increasingly used to attack civilians worldwide. OPNA
poisoning is a global health problem. There is no effective treatment for OPNA survivors. The life-long health
consequences of OPNA survivors are beginning to emerge. However, the mechanisms of OPNA-induced
long-term brain injury are largely unknown. Acute exposure to OPNA induces seizures (neural excitability) and
status epilepticus (SE). In the long term, SE-induced brain changes alter the signaling molecules in neurons
and glia. We hypothesize that OPNA-induced SE promotes key molecular interactions and exacerbates
neurodegeneration, reactive gliosis, and the development of epilepsy. In recent years, novel pathways of
neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are emerging as mechanistic targets for therapeutic development.
Our current findings and others suggest that a non-receptor Src family tyrosine kinase Fyn and a
serine/threonine cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) are the critical kinases activated in both neurons and glia
in response to status epileptics (SE) that promote neuroinflammation, hyperexcitability, and
neurodegeneration. The activated Fyn and CDK5 can trigger a self-perpetuating pathway in the glia and
interact with phosphorylated tau, NR2B, and PSD95 in neurons to promote and maintain the disease state.
Therefore, our overarching hypothesis is that the seizures induced by acute exposure to OPNA facilitate
Fyn-tau interactions in neurons and CDK5 and Fyn activation in both glia and neurons. These, in turn, activate
NR2B-PSD95 interactions to cause neuronal hyperexcitability (epileptiform spiking and spontaneous
seizures), reactive gliosis and the production of proinflammatory cytokines (neuroinflammation), nitrooxidative
stress and neurodegeneration (“disease promoters”), and promote brain pathogenesis in the long term.
We will test the hypothesis in a well-characterized OPNA (diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP)) rat model. In
Specific Aim 1 (SA1), after acute exposure to DFP, we will characterize the changes in Fyn, tau, and CDK5
and their interactions at various time points in key brain regions. We will fractionate brain lysates to isolate
synaptosomal membranes, cytosol, and nuclear fractions and conduct co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP)/WB.
We will use brain sections for proximity ligation assay (PLA) to determine interacting complexes and
immunohistochemistry for cell-specific localization of signaling molecules, gliosis, and neurodegeneration. In
SA2, we will validate these interactions using Fyn-tau interactions blocking peptide and a CDK5 inhibitor. We
will investigate the interactions of Fyn and CDK5 with NR2B and PSD95 and their impact on hyperexcitability,
neurodegeneration, and protection by pathway inhibitors and blocking peptides. We will investigate peripheral
biomarkers of neurodegeneration in the serum and CSF. This proposal is in response to the CCRP initiative
FOA (PAR-23-027), “which is expected to generate data that elucidate the mechanisms of OPNA-induced
brain toxicity and potential new targets for therapeutic development.”"

Ferroptosis is a unique type of programmed cell death that is induced by excessive lipid peroxidation.
Emerging evidence suggests that ferroptosis represents a vulnerability in certain types of cancer that have
acquired resistance to therapies. However, the signaling mechanisms that can be harnessed to promote
cancer cell ferroptosis and its functional consequence on the tumor microenvironment (TME) reprogramming
are poorly understood. In this Proposal, we aim to study a previously unrecognized anti-ferroptotic effect
imparted by mitochondrial calcium signaling, which may also contribute to the establishment of
immunosuppressive TME. Mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) is a highly selective calcium channel that is
localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane, which promotes the production of metabolite acetyl-coenzyme
A (acetyl-CoA) by targeting the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). In preliminary studies, we discovered that
MCU-mediated acetyl-CoA generation blocks both cancer cell ferroptosis and antitumor immunity. We found
that genetic ablation of Mcu (Mcu−/−) abolished acetylation of the glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a critical
gatekeeper of ferroptosis, which correlated with impaired GPX4 activity and enhanced sensitivity to ferroptosis
induction. Moreover, Mcu deficiency in cancer cells significantly blunted their growth and improved antitumor
immune response. Therefore, blockade of MCU function may represent a promising therapeutic regimen for
cancer. The goal of our proposed research proposal is to examine the function and mechanism of MCU-
mediated acetyl-CoA metabolism on GPX4-controlled ferroptosis and its impact on antitumor immunity. We
hypothesize that 1) decreased acetyl-CoA production in the absence of MCU sensitizes cancer cells to
ferroptosis due to GPX4 hypoacetylation; 2) elevated ferroptotic cell death of Mcu−/− cancer cells promotes the
production of type 1 interferon by intratumoral myeloid cells via the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-
dependent DNA-sensing pathway, leading to enhanced antitumor immunity; and 3) pharmacological inhibition
of MCU by MCU-i11 synergizes with programmed death-1 (PD-1) blockade in limiting tumor growth.
Representative syngeneic tumor models with high or low immunogenicity will be employed to examine the
effect of MCU-mediated ferroptosis on antitumor immunity. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of tumor-
infiltrating immune cells in response to MCU-i11 treatment will be performed to understand whether MCU
inhibition promotes antitumor immunity. Results of these studies will provide novel insights into the induction
and function of ferroptosis in rejuvenating antitumor immunity, which can potentially lead to the identification of
new therapeutic targets in cancer treatment."
10852704,"2-8% of the US population report “long COVID” symptoms – including “brain fog,” thinking difficulties, memory
problems, and psychiatric symptoms such as sleep disturbance, anxiety, and depression. Rates of post-
COVID-19 symptoms are nearly double in the Veteran population. These cognitive symptoms contribute to
functional impairments, reduced quality of life, poorer self-reported health status, psychological distress,
delayed return to work, new onset disability, reduced community integration, and increased healthcare
utilization. One promising treatment to improve both everyday functioning and cognition secondary to post-
COVID-19 symptoms is Compensatory Cognitive Training (CCT). Previous studies have found that CCT is
feasible, acceptable, and efficacious in Veteran populations with multiple sources of cognitive dysfunction. The
proposed CDA provides a golden opportunity to evaluate CCT for Veterans with prolonged COVID-19
symptoms (CCT-C), compared with a robust control condition, Holistic Cognitive Education (HCE). The project
closely aligns with current RR&D priorities, by “examining COVID-19-specific rehabilitation interventions and
responses to treatment” and by addressing “late or delayed effects of secondary conditions related to COVID-
19 infections on impairment and disability.” Specific aims are 1) to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of
remote CCT-C with 70 Veterans (35 CCT-C, 35 HCE) with post-COVID-19 cognitive symptoms to examine
feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy; 2) to examine the preliminary efficacy of CCT-C in this population
on overall functioning, as measured by the World Health Organization’s Disability Assessment Schedule
(WHODAS 2.0), performance-based measures of functional capacity, and secondary outcomes (cognitive
performance, quality of life, self-reported cognitive problems, psychiatric symptoms, sleep disturbance, and
engagement in work/community activities); and 3) to explore moderators of outcome (e.g., age, initial COVID-
19 severity, baseline cognitive functioning, presence of PTSD/mTBI history; biomarkers related to COVID-19
infection). The candidate, Dr. Tara Austin, is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the VA San Diego Healthcare
System. The overarching objective of Dr. Austin’s Career Development Award–2 (CDA-2) research plan is to
build on her previous clinical and research experience in interventional neuropsychology and establish her
research career focused on cognitive rehabilitation treatments for Veterans. Specifically, her training plan has
been designed to develop expertise in adapting cognitive rehabilitation treatments for novel populations
exposed to a range of chemical, physical, environmental, and infectious hazards, including exposure to novel
infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. Her proposed training includes training in cognitive rehabilitation (Dr.
Twamley), clinical trial methodology (Drs. Twamley and Thomas), cognitive and functional outcomes (Drs.
Twamley, Ford, and Wynn), biomarkers associated with neuroinflammation (Drs. Ford and Pulliam), and
advanced statistical techniques (Dr. Thomas). This training will support Dr. Austin’s career as an independent
VA research scientist with expertise in developing and evaluating interventions to improve functioning and
quality of life in Veterans with cognitive symptoms secondary to exposures or illnesses such as COVID-19."

The primary objective of this T32 renewal proposal is to continue the University of Minnesota (UMN) Pediatric
Endocrinology Program's tradition of guiding pediatric endocrinology fellows into academic careers, by
providing intensive training in basic, translational, patient-oriented, or education science. Our secondary
objective is to provide an environment that will facilitate the successful advancement of women into academic
careers. The program has been highly successful in achieving its goals. From its inception in 2004 through the
summer of 2019, we will have graduated 11 fellows from the 3 year training program, with an additional 3 in
training. Nine of our 11 graduates are women, and 7 currently have University faculty appointments. Two are
Associate Professors one is expected be promoted to Professor within the next couple years. Our goal at last
renewal was to increase the diversity of our trainees, which we achieved by recruiting both an Hispanic and an
Africa American fellow. Fellows are selected based on a demonstrated desire to pursue research training.
They may follow a clinical/translational, a basic science, or a medical education path, and are expected to
obtain a master's degree to formally and rigorously prepare them for a scholarly career. We work closely with
incoming fellows to join their research interests with available opportunities and experienced mentors who can
support their training and provide guidance for advancement to the next phase of their academic careers. The
core group of senior faculty mentors are well established investigators, selected for their ability to impart a
culture of responsible, rigorous, and robust science, as is the tradition of the UMN. Numerous and varied
research opportunities are available. The program has particular research strengths in the critical public health
domains of diabetes, obesity, and metabolism. Members of the Division of Pediatric Endocrinology enjoy a
strong tradition of scientific collaboration with other divisions within the Department of Pediatrics, other
departments within the UMN, and other institutions including the Mayo Clinic. This provides fellows with a rich
environment for scientific collaboration. The program trains physician scientists in the spectrum of skills
necessary to be well-grounded in the fundamental underpinnings of their research area by the completion of
fellowship so they are ready to enter a junior faculty academic research position."

The aim of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center Flow Cytometry Core Facility is to
provide analysis and cell sorting to enhance scientific interaction and productivity within Northwestern
University’s research community. This is accomplished by allowing access to quality controlled highly
specialized technology, education, and technical assistance in a cost-effective manner. All sorting
demands for the entire campus are accomplished on six BD instruments (four high-end and two mid-
level sorters) and one Miltenyi MACSQuant Tyto. Our high-end sorters are heavily utilized and
exceed over 4900 hours, even though our total practical capacity is 4572 hours. Additionally,
three of our high-end sorters are also nearing their end-of-life (over 10 years and showing
increased downtimes resulting from age and repairs. This, together with the increased user
demand, leads to scheduling wait times of 2-4 weeks. Since much of our user base utilizes human
patient and other time-sensitive specimens, which tend to come in at short notice, we are no longer
able to accommodate these sorting requests in a timely manner. Should a sorter be down due to major
repairs or must be decommissioned due to extensiveness of repairs; not having a replacement sorter
to provide uninterrupted service, further hinders investigators’ research. Additionally, with installation
of a 5-laser 50-parameter BD FACSymphony S6 cell sorter in 2021, many of the users have transitioned
or are in the process of transitioning to more complex 18-33 color assays for spectral based-cell sorting.
However, the current FACSAria’s lack the ability to translate these panels directly into cell sorting for
further downstream assays, thus limiting research. This proposal is for purchase of a 5-laser 78-
fluorescent detector system (86-parameters total) BD FACSDiscover S8 cell sorter with CellView Image
Technology, integrated in a biosafety cabinet. This is the first high-dimensional sorter combining
spectral flow cytometry with real-time spatial and morphological insights, thus empowering scientists to
address previously impossible-to-answer questions. The CellView Image Technology will further
enhance and allow for assays including sort QC, label-free sorting, fluorescent localization, cell-cycle
analysis and cell-cell interactions. The instrument, in addition to providing the acutely needed additional
capacity, will accommodate the high parameter cell sorting demands and allow for better detection and
efficient sorting of rarer events. The sorter will be permanently integrated in a Baker Class II Type A2
biosafety hood. This will provide state-of-the-art cell sorter instrumentation that can keep pace with the
technological advances and growing needs of future. This sorter will enable safe single cell high-
parameter image-capable spectral cell sorting of human and other animal specimen to meet the
increasingly complex needs of our user base and advancing research in a timely manner."
10852416,"The complement system plays an important role in a diverse spectrum of kidney diseases, including
autoimmune glomerulonephritis as well as many conditions not traditionally thought of as immune-mediated.
Factor H (FH) is a centrally important complement protein in the blood that serves as a major regulator of
complement activation in both the fluid phase as well as on cell surfaces and interstitial matrices. Factor H-
related proteins (FHRs) comprise a structurally related family of five genes in humans which have recently
been identified as key pathogenic drivers of human kidney diseases by acting as modulators of complement
and/or FH function. However, the functions of the FHRs are complex and controversial. In addition, animal
models of individual FHR deficiency and FHR protein-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were not
previously available for evaluating the in vivo roles of these proteins. Our proposal addresses this important
knowledge gap. The overall hypothesis of this project is that individual FHRs competitively antagonize or
otherwise modulate FH function and complement activation on specific surfaces in the kidney, and this has
a profound effect on complement-mediated inflammation at these sites. Furthermore, by interfering with C3d-
receptor interactions, the FHRs also have a strong effect on the upstream immune response to self and
foreign antigens. To test this hypothesis we propose the following specific aims. Aim 1. Examine the functions
of the different FHRs on distinct kidney surfaces. We have developed a “toolbox” for studying the FHRs in
the kidney, including mice with targeted deletion of the individual FHRs, recombinant forms of the FHRs, and
monoclonal antibodies to the FHRs. We will use these tools to map the interactions of the FHRs with healthy
and diseased kidneys. Aim 2. Examine the roles of individual murine FHRs in the development of
autoimmunity. We will use panel of FHR deficient mice to study the effects of these proteins on the
development of antibodies to self and foreign antigens. Aim 3. Examine the role of the FHRs as downstream
mediators of kidney inflammation. We will use FHR-deficient mice and recombinant FHR proteins to examine
the role of the FHRs in causing complement dysregulation in glomerular and tubulointerstitial diseases. The
studies in this proposal are innovative, because they utilize novel reagents and approaches to examine the
function of the FHRs. This project is significant, because will improve our understanding of a family of proteins
that are poorly understood but that have been linked with several different diseases."

Clinical staging is gaining traction as a potentially powerful framework for understanding the pathogenesis and
emergence of serious mental illnesses (SMI), such as schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BP), and severe
depression (severe-DEP), across development, and for guiding early interventions that aim to alter disease
trajectory. However, realizing the full potential of this approach requires overcoming a number of challenges.
These challenges include the imprecise boundaries between psychiatric disorders; unclear validity and
specificity of early clinical and neurobehavioral markers for predicting later illness onset; and growing
recognition that current psychiatric nosology may not map onto differences in underlying etiology in an optimal
way. Indeed, as large-scale genetic studies continue to unravel the genetic architecture of psychiatric
disorders, it has become clear that genetic risk for each disorder is complex and highly polygenic; involves
variants that span the allelic frequency range; and that individual genetic variants frequently confer risk for
multiple disorders. Leveraging genetic risk profiles to define groups of at-risk individuals and map the
progression of clinical phenotypes across development may therefore offer a more biologically valid approach
for defining the nosology of psychiatric disorders, identifying biomarkers with the greatest predictive validity
and specificity for different clinical outcomes, and optimizing early intervention. Towards this end, the current
project will investigate the relationships between genetic risk profiles and early markers of psychopathology in
the “Paisa,” a genetically and culturally homogenous population that predominates in the Andean Mountains of
Colombia. Specifically, we will build upon our existing infrastructure for large-scale studies of SMI in the region
to establish a new cohort of 3,000 children and early adolescents at elevated (n = 2,700) or low risk (n = 300)
for SMI. We will obtain DNA samples and comprehensive clinical and neurobehavioral phenotyping and will
generate common-variant based polygenic risk scores (PRS) for major psychiatric disorders, as well as rare
variant scores summarizing burden of rare damaging variants and copy number deletions. We will characterize
relationships between clinical syndromes and neurobehavioral traits in childhood (Aim 1). We will then map
relationships between common variant-based genetic risk for SMI, rare damaging variant burden, and
psychiatric diagnoses in childhood (Aim 2), as well as cognitive, motor, sensory, and psychological markers of
functioning (Aim 3). Finally, using existing state-of-the-art psychiatric electronic medical record (EMR)
databases to obtain longitudinal outcomes, we will explore genetic and clinical and neurobehavioral
characteristics associated with poor clinical outcome within 2 years. Study findings will clarify trans-diagnostic
vs. disorder-specific neurobehavioral profiles in childhood, identify clinical syndromes and neurobehavioral
traits in childhood associated with genetic liability for SMI, and quantify the relative power of genetic versus
clinical and neurobehavioral characteristics for predicting proximal psychiatric outcomes."
10841405,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation electron transport chain (ETC) is composed of five large
membrane protein complexes (CI, CII, CIII2, CIV and CV) and is responsible for the production of the majority
of cellular ATP. Consequently, the ETC is essential to bioenergetic metabolism. ETC defects are one of the
most commonly diagnosed congenital metabolic defects, with CI deficiencies representing roughly a third of
these diagnoses. Although ~50% of patients with CI deficiencies die within the first 2 years of life and only
~25% reach 10 years of age, CI remains the least well mechanistically understood of all the ETC complexes.
Furthermore, despite the large medical need, there are currently no effective treatments for CI or other ETC
deficiencies. This discrepancy stems in part from an incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms of
the individual complexes and their higher-order assemblies into supercomplexes (SCs). In mammalian heart
mitochondria the majority of CI is found in association with CIII2 and CIV (SC I+III2+IV, the respirasome) or in
association with CIII2 (SC I+III2). Recent biochemical and structural work has produced the first atomic-
resolution structures of mammalian mitochondrial CI and defined the arrangement of the individual complexes
within the respirasome and SC I+III2. However, significant questions remain regarding the function, mechanism
and regulation of the ETC complexes and SCs. To address these gaps in our understanding and to develop
the basic science that will underpin potential treatment strategies of ETC defects, we will establish two major
research directions in my lab. Using detailed biochemical and enzymatic analyses together with single particle
cryo-electron microscopy structural characterizations, we will elucidate the mechanisms, functions and
regulation of 1) isolated CI and 2) respiratory SCs. To achieve this, we propose to perform systematic
functional and structural comparisons of respiratory CI and SCs purified from mammalian mitochondria (from
both HeLa cell culture and porcine heart tissue), the a-proteobacteria Paracoccus denitrificans and the fungal
model system Neurospora crassa. P. denitrificans is one of the closest living organisms to the ancestral a-
proteobacteria that originated mitochondria after the endosymbiotic event. N. crassa is an established,
powerful genetic and biochemical system for bioenergetics, for which nonetheless no high-resolution ETC
structures are available. Comparing the CI and SCs from these divergent and genetically tractable organisms
to their mammalian counterparts will allow us to test several key mechanistic hypotheses in the field and to
identify the conserved features of CI and SC mechanism and regulation. This will provide deep insights into the
energy-converting mechanism of CI and the physiological roles of SC formation, which will define the scientific
foundation needed for the development of therapeutic strategies against CI and further ETC deficiencies."

 The primary goal of the New York State Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring
System (PRAMS) is to collect high quality population based data on maternal and infant
health that are not available from other sources. Data collected through the PRAMS
program will help New York State address several maternal and child health services
priorities identified in the state’s Prevention Agenda and in the Maternal and Child
Health Services Block Grant. PRAMS data provides important baseline information and
ongoing measures of New York’s progress in addressing maternal and child health
priorities.
 A stratified random sample of women who have recently given birth to a live born
infant in New York State (excluding New York City) are sampled from birth certificate
records between 2-4 months after delivery and is stratified by birthweight
(<2500g/≥2500g). Approximately 140 women will be sampled on a monthly basis for a
yearly sample size of 1,600 for the next five years. PRAMS staff will work in conjunction
with the New York State Department of Health’s Bureau of Production Systems
Management and the Bureau of Biometrics and Health Statistics to ensure access to
birth files for PRAMS sampling. Mothers will be sent up to three questionnaire mailings
with telephone follow-up for non-responders.
 Findings from the PRAMS analysis will be utilized and disseminated by the state’s
internal and external partners to monitor Prevention Agenda and Maternal and Child
Health priorities. In addition, PRAMS data will be disseminated via the PRAMS
Dashboard on the New York State Department of Health public web site to support
public health policy and program improvement. This site provides public access to
PRAMS data and is widely used by Health Department programs for evaluation and
assessment of ongoing DOH initiatives. The dashboard includes data on 64 indicators
with tables and trend graphs from 2004 – 2017."

The Tennessee Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) is a four-way partnership between a research-intensive
institution (Vanderbilt University Medical Center, VUMC), a historically black medical college (Meharry Medical
College, MMC), an academically-engaged state health department (Tennessee Department of Health, TDH),
and a sophisticated community-based organization with a 25-year exclusive focus on HIV (Nashville CARES).
To achieve the overall aims of the CFAR and its cores requires an innovative, flexible, and engaged
Administrative Core (AC). The significance and impact of the AC is heightened by the multi-institutional structure
of the CFAR, making its work critical to the success of the program. The AC will add value to the significance of
HIV research at our partnered institutions by providing leadership and resources for collaborations that will
impact the field. The work of the AC is grounded in transparent communication, maximizing efficient use of
financial and human resources, and serving the needs of HIV researchers across our diverse institutions. The
AC is the “operating system” of the CFAR, overseeing resources and creating a collaborative environment for
CFAR members. The AC will support the entire CFAR enterprise by pursuing four specific aims: 1) To provide
leadership, management, coordination, and supervision of CFAR activities; 2) To enhance the HIV research
productivity of CFAR investigators by supporting and coordinating collaborative and trans-disciplinary
approaches; and 3) To facilitate effective and bi-directional communication about HIV-related research
resources, activities and advances. The CFAR leverages Vanderbilt's strength in developing biomedical
informatics tools to support research operations. The AC will leverage such biomedical informatics tools to
support CFAR operations through real-time data collection for continuous quality improvement. This empowers
the AC and CFAR to efficiently provide institutional leadership in HIV, needed core services for CFAR
investigators, and mentoring of future leaders in HIV research."

The Tennessee Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) is a four-way partnership between a research-intensive
institution (Vanderbilt University Medical Center), a historically black medical college (Meharry Medical College),
an academically-engaged state health department (Tennessee Department of Health), and a sophisticated
community-based organization with a 25-year exclusive focus on HIV (Nashville CARES). The Developmental
Core (DC) will support and enhance collaborative, interdisciplinary HIV/AIDS research at the four partner
institutions. Invigorated by new DC initiatives and leadership, the DC will pursue three complementary objectives:
1) To administer a robust CFAR DC Awards program that supports interdisciplinary HIV research projects and
new HIV research pilot projects; 2) To ensure mentoring of investigators new to HIV research, with a focus on
early stage, minority, women, and public health investigators, to enhance competitiveness for extramural funding,
and; 3) To foster academic skills development and scientific team-building. In 2019, the DC leadership structure
transitioned, with John Koethe, MD, MSCI, Associate Professor of Medicine at Vanderbilt, assuming the role of
DC Director, supported by Fernando Villalta, PhD and Tim Sterling, MD as Associate Directors. This change was
in response to extensive strategic planning, with input from the our CFAR External and Internal Scientific
Advisory Boards, as part of succession planning for the upcoming funding cycle of this CFAR. The DC will not
only provide DC Award funding for promising early-stage investigators but will continue to assure that there is
appropriate mentoring together with activities to foster team building. This will help early-stage investigators
appreciate the critical importance of effective collaboration as they develop into accomplished academic
research scientists. The HIV-focused DC Awards, mentoring, and skills development will be leveraged with
outstanding institutional support at Vanderbilt (through the Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational
Research; VICTR) and at Meharry (through the Meharry Translational Research Center; MeTRC, and the Center
for Health Disparities Research at MMC) to maximize the potential for important, ground-breaking research that
will lead to extramural funding support, and that ultimately has substantial impact on the burden of HIV in
Tennessee, the nation, and worldwide."
10843824,"Clinical Sciences Core – PROJECT SUMMARY
The Tennessee Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) is located in the Southeastern US, the region with both the
greatest number of new HIV-1 infections, and of persons living with HIV. The CFAR is a four-way partnership
between a research-intensive institution (Vanderbilt University Medical Center), a historically black medical
college (Meharry Medical College), an academically engaged state health department (Tennessee Department
of Health), and an highly evolved HIV-focused community-based organization (Nashville CARES). This CFAR's
institutional and community environment is rich in opportunity, and with a culture of engagement and
collaboration. The Clinical Sciences Core (CSC) fills major gaps in the local research environment, and in so
doing supports the mission of the CFAR to reduce the overall burden of HIV/AIDS through the pursuit of National
Institutes of Health high priorities for HIV/AIDS research, with the ultimate goal of ending the HIV epidemic.
Access to research study participants and associated biospecimens, and to large clinical cohort datasets, are
essential for high-quality clinical and translational HIV research. Since this CFAR was established in 2015, the
CSC has been integral to its success. The CSC is essential for early stage investigators on their path toward
independent extramural funding, which equips the next generation of research scientists while also serving to
expand this CFAR's HIV research portfolio and funding base. Building upon the expertise and collective
infrastructure of the CFAR, coupled with the addition of a strong, established community partner in CARES, we
will pursue the following three specific aims: 1) To propel the use of observational databases for high impact HIV
clinical and translational research; 2) To support research projects that require access to study volunteers and
associated biological specimens, and; 3) To support research opportunities for MMC investigators, including team
science."
10843825,"Laboratory Sciences Core – PROJECT SUMMARY
The CFAR Laboratory Sciences (LSC) provides services specifically designed to meet the needs of HIV clinical,
translational and basic science researchers. Over the past grant cycle, we established multiple services for
CFAR investigators, with an easily accessible scheduling and chargeback system, regardless of investigators'
prior level of laboratory experience or training. These include cell isolation and cryopreservation protocols for
PBMCs, adipose tissue, and skin. We developed cell staining protocols for analytical flow cytometry to evaluate
the phenotype and function of B and T lymphocytes, and flow sorting assays to bulk sort populations of
lymphocytes, or to perform single-cell sorting for detailed transcriptomic analyses. Vanderbilt has long prioritized
institutional support for shared core facilities and invested accordingly. The services that the LSC established
over the prior funding cycle were carefully designed to address needs unmet by other non-CFAR Vanderbilt core
facilities, while simultaneously taking advantage of the impressive range of institutional cores that are equally
available to investigators at Vanderbilt and Meharry. Our successes have allowed us to anticipate the future
needs of this CFAR. An institutional core, VANTAGE (VANderbilt Technologies for Advanced Genomics), has
significantly enhanced our ability to analyze single cells, including B cell receptor and T cell receptor sequencing,
and RNA transcriptional profiling. VANTAGE has also designed assays to perform whole HIV genome, including
integration site, sequencing. The LSC, in addition to providing its own services, will function as a concierge
service. We will help investigators design appropriate flow cytometry panels, and sort cells, and leverage
VANTAGE to perform sequencing and analysis. The mission of the LSC is to continue to provide sustainable
leadership and services specifically responsive to the needs of HIV investigators, so that these services are used
in ways unimaginable without CFAR. The LSC will work closely with CFAR investigators to design assays,
facilitate assay performance, and help interpret results. The LSC will promote basic, clinical and translational
HIV research through two Specific Aims: 1) To provide expertise, consultation, assay performance, and training
in immunology techniques including those that require BSL3 procedures. These include study design and
implementation of state-of-the-art assays to measure phenotype and function of cell subsets relevant to HIV and
to quantitate HIV protein and nucleic acid in plasma samples and in vitro culture. 2) To provide concierge level
service for genomics research relevant to HIV. Services include access to single-cell transcriptomics
technologies, viral genome evolutionary sequence analysis, and host microbiome analysis relevant to HIV
disease pathogenesis."

10844597,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Shigella spp. are a major global cause of diarrhea and dysentery. Children <5 years of age living in low- and
middle-income countries are the most affected. Mortality is second only to rotavirus among diarrheal pathogens,
and repeated bouts of disease cause lifelong disability. The incidence of Shigella diarrhea is low during the first
year of life, increases dramatically in toddlers 12- to 23-month-old, surpassing all other pathogens, and
decreases once again after 24 months of age. Maternal immunity likely contributes to the early shielding of
disease in young infants, while subsequent exposure establishes an adaptive immunity that reduces risk of
infection from 2 years of age onwards. Much of what is known about Shigella immunity comes from studies in
adults, while detailed information on elements that can prevent infection in children is lacking. The currently
favored and most clinically advanced vaccine concept, a parenterally delivered O-polysaccharide-protein
conjugate, has failed in young children <3 years of age in field studies.
Our group has access to clinical specimens from a longitudinal cohort of mothers and infants living in Malawi
(where Shigella is endemic) from the time of birth to 2 years of age, with infant surveillance for Shigella infection.
We propose to interrogate with unprecedented depth the continuum of Shigella immunity in these children to
define maternal antibodies (Ab) that help prevent shigellosis during the first months of life and the immune
responses these children acquire post exposure that reduces the risk of infection after the 2-year-old mark.
Accrual of Ab up to 5 years of age will be monitored in a separate longitudinal cohort of children from Malawi.
Our preliminary data revealed strong anti-microbial immunity mediated by human Ab specific for Shigella proteins
(i.e. IpaB and VirG); these Ab engage innate immune cells and have distinct functional capabilities compared to
Ab against LPS. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that protein-specific immunity is critical to protect
children against Shigella infection. In Aim 1, we will interrogate the biophysical and functional properties of
systemic Ab using a Systems Serology platform as well as T- and B-cell responses to Shigella proteins in the
pediatric cohorts. In Aim 2, the Systems Serology approach will be used to characterize Ab in breast milk. All
immunological readouts will be compared longitudinally between infected and non-infected children to unmask
correlates of protective immunity. In Aim 3, we will apply the knowledge acquired in Aims 1 and 2 and novel
recombinant technology to rationally engineer protein-specific human monoclonal Ab with maximal antimicrobial
function using peripheral blood cells from the mothers with the highest immunity.
This application is timely, given that there are neither vaccines to prevent Shigella infection and its devastating
consequences, particularly in young children, nor immune therapeutics that could overcome multi-drug
resistance. The synergistic effort and unique resources of G. Alter at Ragon Institute and M. Pasetti at University
of Maryland assures the success of this clinically relevant proposal, which will greatly advance the field."
10845109,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - HUMAN IMMUNOLOGIC MONITORING FACILITY
The Human Immunologic Monitoring (HIM) Facility supports the development of state-of-the-art immunologic
assays for University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC) investigators. In 2002,
the HIM became a full CCSG Core and has been under continuous leadership direction. The primary mission
of HIM is to provide technical support and expertise for the analysis of scientific endpoints pertaining to host
immune responses at the interface with cancer. This includes predictive/prognostic biomarkers connected
with clinical outcomes and pharmacodynamic biomarkers describing effects of immunotherapeutic
interventions. Because of the complexities of the tumor-host interaction, these assays extend beyond
peripheral blood-based analyses of immune cells to include molecular and histologic evaluations of the
tumor microenvironment, banking of germline DNA for SNP analysis, and of stool samples for microbiome
sequencing. HIM makes available to UCCCC members a broad range of state-of-the-art immunologic
assays, performed under a rigorous quality control program. HIM also offers consultation regarding optimal
immunologic assessment, assay development, and assistance in processing and storage of patient samples
for future immunological analyses. Prospective UCCCC users are required to provide a summary of their
study design, which is reviewed by HIM, in order to design the most appropriate methodology to successfully
measure the endpoints of the study. In the current CCSG cycle, HIM supported 35 unique UCCCC members,
with 21 federally funded peer-reviewed cancer-relevant grants, supported 57 clinical trials for analyzing the
immune responses, and 35 peer reviewed publications (86% in journals with impact factor ≥ 10).
Tumor microenvironment analysis is further enabled through multispectral immune fluorescence imaging,
RNAscope, scRNAseq, and spatial transcriptomics. In addition to its services, HIM interfaces with the
Genomics Core Facility (GCF), the Bioinformatics Core Facility (BiCF), and computational staff of the NCI
Genomic Data Commons (GDC), the bacterial sequencing infrastructure at Argonne National Laboratory
(ANL) and the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL), significantly expanding the range of services provided
by HIM. Overall, the specialized immunologic assays and scientific questions involved are uniquely enabled
by HIM in a way not satisfied by any other facility or infrastructure entity within the University of Chicago.
Therefore, HIM lies at the heart of the UCCCC’s clinical/translational effort in cancer immunotherapy and is
vital for the scientific investigation of novel agents."

In this study, we aim to develop a protocol for pharmacy home televisits for medication
management in older adults who have multiple chronic conditions and are on multiple

examine the effect of these televisits on appropriate medication use, medication discrepancies,
adherence and adverse drug events and observe and gather information on implementation.
We anticipate that a pharmacist led medication management home televisit intervention will lead
to reduction in potentially inappropriate use of medication, reduction in medication
discrepancies, increased medication adherence and reduced adverse drug events in older

medications. We will then conduct a randomized trial with hybrid effectiveness Type I design to
examine the effect of these televisits on appropriate medication use, medication discrepancies,
adherence and adverse drug events and observe and gather information on implementation.
We anticipate that a pharmacist led medication management home televisit intervention will lead
to reduction in potentially inappropriate use of medication, reduction in medication
discrepancies, increased medication adherence and reduced adverse drug events in older
adults compared to older adults receiving usual care. We will also examine the barriers and
facilitators in implementing the intervention so that the study findings may inform future
implementation."

 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are venerable targets for drug discovery. One-third of all drugs in
clinical use target a GPCR. The endogenous ligands for many GPCRs are peptides, which make peptides ideal
probes for exploring the structure-activity relationship of these GPCRs, and for developing drugs that modulate
their activity. While a select few native GPCR peptide ligands have been successfully translated into human
therapies, the vast majority are plagued by inadequate PK/PD properties and make very poor drugs. Replacing
the natural amino acids (AAs) in the peptide with non-proteinogenic amino acids (NPAAs) can enhance the drug-
like properties of ordinary peptides, thereby improving their practical use as medicines. 80% of all GPCR peptide
drugs contain NPAAs. Determining which NPAAs to include in the peptide and where to place them largely
depends on trial and error, each peptide variant being made as the unique product of a separate multi-step solid-
phase chemical synthesis procedure that relies on a limited pool of NPAAs with poor solid-phase coupling
efficiencies. New technologies which enable NPAAs to be introduced into peptides in a general, synthetically
divergent, and cost-effective manner would (1) considerably improve GPCR peptide drug development as it is
practiced today, (2) enable access to comprehensive peptide libraries to thoroughly explore structure-activity
relationships of GPCRs, and (3) promote the development and deployment of new synthetic methods, which will
in turn advance the fields of synthetic chemistry and medicinal peptide chemistry.
 Our laboratory has developed a new parallel synthesis approach that generates entire libraries of
individual peptide analogs in a single step. We have shown that this strategy can yield libraries of peptides
wherein a single amino acid is transformed to one of a myriad of new NPAA variants. To further develop our
strategy as a general tool for medicinal chemistry and demonstrate its advantages for optimizing GPCR peptides
we propose here to generate and to evaluate libraries of a new GPCR peptide ligand designed by our lab that
has promising anti-HIV activity. By pursuing both chemistry and biology in parallel we will use our new peptide
as a vehicle to refine and improve our newly minted chemical methodology to prepare (1) peptides with multiple
NPAAs, and (2) peptides containing D-amino acids, which will advance our peptide as an entirely new
antiretroviral drug and will make our synthetic platform more useful for GPCR peptide drug development."

 Drug discovery is one of the most challenging tasks in biological sciences; it takes about 10-15 years and
$2 billion on average to discover a new drug. The main goal in drug discovery is identifying drug-like com-
pounds (ligands) capable of modulating speciﬁc biological targets (proteins). One key feature of protein-ligand
interactions is the binding free energy change, G, that occurs between the protein and the ligand upon the
ligand's attachment. This physiochemical feature heavily dictates how strongly a protein and ligand interact and
is particularly useful to understand for drug design. While wet-lab experiments accurately estimate G, they
are signiﬁcantly slow, costly, and laborious. On the other hand, computational simulations enable signiﬁcantly
faster estimation of G and shed light on the binding mechanism of various structures that could have been
complicated to be examined otherwise. The implicit solvent framework, which treats solvent as a continuum
with the dielectric and non-polar properties of water, offer much more efﬁcient estimation of G compared
to other computational methodologies, such as alchemical free energy methods. Despite noticeable progress
in implicit solvent modeling, serious concerns about its accuracy remain that stem from the underlying physi-
cal approximations. This research will employ modern machine learning techniques to bridge the accuracy gap
between a physics-based implicit solvent model and experimental references in terms of G calculations. In
particular, experimental data will be integrated into a generalized Born (GB) implicit solvent model so that with
adherence to the physical model, new structural features could improve the accuracy. In addition to the model
accuracy, it is essential to retain interpretability (that accounts for the model simplicity) and transferability (that
assures consistent performance on different datasets). To this end, a novel multi-objective loss function will be
introduced that takes “accuracy”, “interpretability”, and “transferability” into consideration. Standard protein-ligand
databases, benchmarks, and datasets will be used for designing the proposed hybrid model, including host-guest
systems, SAMPL challenge benchmarks, PDBbind, and BindingDB. While some of these sources contain clean
data, many require further post-processing to prepare for running the GB model. Careful data preparation will
be performed by following standard protocols and via popular web services. The modular characteristics of the
proposed physics-data model will allow for testing various ﬂavors of implicit solvent (physics-based model) and
modiﬁcations to the proposed Graph Convolutional Network (data-driven model). This ﬂexibility of the hybrid
model facilitates new interdisciplinary research between the classical physics-based and the modern data-driven
ends. The ﬁnal source code and parameterized datasets will be available freely to the public. They could be
incorporated into the high-throughput virtual screening of candidate drugs in the early stages of drug discovery.
The outcome of this research will beneﬁt the biomolecular modeling community by providing an approach to build
novel, accurate, and efﬁcient computational models for studying protein-ligand interactions."

In the current paradigm of protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, ubiquitination of protein
substrates has been considered as a major regulatory step. Hundreds of ubiquitinating enzymes regulate
polyubiquitination, to target proteins to the proteasome for degradation. This paradigm has led to remarkable
discoveries on how protein degradation is required for fundamental cellular processes, and also for destroying
misfolded or aberrant proteins, which can lead to cancers and neurodegenerative conditions. However, a
significant knowledge gap exists in the current paradigm, as to how the cell ensures the proper number of
functional proteasomes. Our research goal is to overcome this gap, by elucidating mechanisms of proteasome
assembly. We discovered multiple evolutionarily conserved chaperones that are dedicated to proteasome
assembly. In our model of proteasome assembly, chaperones hinder subunit addition until a given step of
assembly occurs correctly. This model suggests a new concept, that assembly is not simply a series of subunit
additions—it is also integrated with extensive quality control (QC). We will pursue this new direction of
research—unraveling mechanisms of chaperone-mediated QC during proteasome assembly. For QC, the
assembly process is a “moving target” as one step progresses to the next. How can these moving targets be
monitored? Chaperones can “mark” all of them, using a fundamental mechanism—specifically binding to
assembly intermediates. We will investigate how chaperones serve as components (e.g. adaptors) of extensive
QC of the proteasome, via three aims. First, we will examine chaperones’ new connections to proteasomal
nuclear localization signals (NLSs), which have been known for ~20 years to exist on proteasome subunits, but
their functions are poorly characterized. We hypothesize that proteasomal NLSs drive chaperones into the
nucleus, as a QC mechanism, to prevent defective proteasomes from forming in the cytoplasm. Second,
we will investigate the non-canonical role of ubiquitination via an E3 ligase, Not4, during proteasome assembly.
Bulky polyubiquitin sterically prevents the addition of the next subunits, blocking proteasome assembly, for QC.
We hypothesize that this non-canonical role of polyubiquitin depends on a specific chaperone, Nas6 (an
oncoprotein, Gankyrin in humans). Third, we will interrogate how chaperones help form proteasome storage
granules, which preserve functional proteasomes during nutritional stress. We hypothesize that chaperones
help distinguish functional proteasomes—via binding to sub-complexes—but in this case, resulting from
proteasome disassembly during nutritional stress. We will interrogate these hypotheses using our well-
established biochemical, cell biological, and proteomics strategies, together with our powerful yeast model to
assess proteasome functions in vivo. Proteasome assembly chaperones are dysregulated in many cancers,
altering proteasomal activities. Since the proteasome is a proven therapeutic target, we envision exploiting these
chaperones to modulate cellular protein degradation, to broaden the application of the proteasome as a target."

 Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling directs the development of multiple organs and tissues,
and is the cause of multiple congenital and adult diseases, including cardiovascular defects, kidney disease,
pulmonary hypertension, and is important in medical applications in orthopedics, endodontics, and tissue
engineering. BMP heterodimers exhibit consistently higher signaling activity to BMP homodimers in a multitude
of contexts. Understanding how BMP heterodimers signal more effectively will lead to their more successful use
in tissue engineering, bone repair, regeneration, and therapeutics. The zebrafish offers a paradigm of exclusive
BMP heterodimer signaling in patterning the dorsoventral embryonic axis as a morphogen, with different levels
specifying distinct cell types. This grant revealed specialized functions of the BMP Type I receptors in the
heterodimer signaling mechanism, with Acvr1 exclusively providing the kinase activity to transduce the signal,
whereas surprisingly the Bmpr1 kinase is dispensable. Intriguingly, Bmp2 homodimers were also found to require
the heteromeric Type I receptor complex of Acvr1 and Bmpr1, indicating that the role of the heterodimer is to
bring these two Type I receptors together, which elicits higher signaling activity than homomeric Type I signaling
complexes. This proposal investigates the nature of the subfunctionalized roles of the Type I receptors in
signaling and their trafficking in signal regulation through in vivo live imaging analysis, taking advantage of the
large translucent zebrafish embryo. This grant demonstrated that the BMP gradient is interpreted into three cell
fate domains by concentration thresholds of signaling and not by signal duration or gradient slope thresholds.
Further studies are proposed to understand the outcomes of gradient thresholds and its regulation over time.
 In most vertebrates, polarity of the egg determines polarity of the embryo and establishes the embryonic
dorsal-ventral axis and germ line. Egg polarity originates during oogenesis with the first polarized structure in
vertebrate oocytes, the Balbiani body (Bb), a large, membrane-less structure conserved from insects to
mammals typically composed of mitochondria and ribonucleoproteins, destined to the vegetal pole of the oocyte
and egg. Although fundamental to forming the major axes of most vertebrate embryos, vertebrate oocyte polarity
has been little studied. In zebrafish, a key factor Bucky ball (Buc) was discovered that establishes the Bb and
oocyte polarity. Buc is a highly disordered protein that can undergo a phase transition to form amyloid-like fibers
in vitro. The role of Buc in aggregating the Bb will be studied through unique buc hypomorphic alleles identified
in the previous period that reveal its distinct functions in oocyte polarity, axis formation, and germ line
development. From proteomics analysis of the Bb in the previous period, new highly disordered proteins with
predicted self-aggregation domains will be studied in regulating the Bb. Importantly, inappropriate amyloid
protein aggregates in cells are hallmarks of neurodegenerative disease. Thus, these studies are relevant to
understanding how these aggregates form and can be dissociated in therapeutics."

 The progression of cancer and infectious disease is an evolutionary process. Pathogens engage in an arms
race with their hosts, and while antibiotics/antivirals have enabled us to skew the outcome of these contests,
these bulwarks against contagion are being steadily eroded. Mutation and natural selection, coupled with rapid
generation times and immense pathogen population sizes, provide pathogens a decisive advantage. To regain
the upper hand, we must better understand the evolutionary process, to aid in the development of novel classes
of antimicrobials and devise therapeutic strategies that take into account how these weapons work and how
pathogens evade them. Until recently, efforts to gain a deep understanding of the adaptive process were stymied,
because adaptive mutations are rare and identifying them is challenging. To solve this, we developed a system
to track the evolutionary process, isolate thousands of adaptive lineages, remeasure the fitness of those lineages
across many environments, and cheaply whole genome sequence hundreds to thousands of such mutants.
 I propose a new phase in my ambitious, integrated research program that takes full advantage of this lineage
tracking system, and our discovery of Pareto fronts, which are indicative of trade-offs. We will pursue two major
goals. First, we will expand our understanding of evolution in the face of abiotic selection pressures, especially
those that produce adaptive trade-offs. Specifically, we will determine the role of historical contingency as it
pertains to trade-offs in adaptation, the potential for trade-offs to force canalization (e.g., trapping lineages into
extreme specialization), the influence that epistasis exerts on the geometry of trait space, and the extent to which
adaptive constraints underlie negative and diminishing returns epistasis. Second, we will expand to contrast
these findings with evolutionary outcomes under biotic selection pressures, using two new systems. To model
genetic conflict and arms race dynamics within species we will use the killer yeast system. Killer yeast secrete a
toxin that destroys sensitive yeast, while retaining an intracellular antitoxin. Toxin and antitoxin are both encoded
by a vertically inherited virus, which itself parasitizes a second virus. We will co-evolve killer and sensitive cells
and determine whether, as theory predicts, there are recurrent periods of selection and whether coevolved
solutions show greater trade-offs than typically observed from abiotic selection pressures. To experimentally
model arms race dynamics between species we will use crAssphage, one of the most prevalent bacteriophages
associated with the human gut microbiome. The aim of these evolution experiments will be to evaluate the
dynamics of phage and its bacterial host co-adaptation over trials of short- and medium-term duration. Overall,
this integrated, multi-level research strategy will yield fundamental new insights into how the adaptive process is
constrained under alternative forms of selection. Armed with this deeper understanding of adaptation, we will
better be able to predict the likelihood of different evolutionary futures given knowledge of a genomic present
and thereby gain the upper hand in our battle against human disease."

More than 75% of the data generated from mass spectrometry (MS) - based omics experiments are wasted due to
inefficiency of existing algorithmic methods that deduce peptides. The peptides that do get identified by existing
computational methods usually come from abundant proteins – and hence recent calls by scientists to study
overlooked proteins are gaining traction. These non-abundant and overlooked proteins might have the same (or
more) importance in human systems biology health, and disease. Yet, all downstream analysis and conclusions –
related to human health – are based on suboptimal and incomplete peptide deductions indicating formal investigation
is warranted and urgently needed. In the recent decade, advances in machine-learning (ML) models have provided
a critical step and have made it possible to develop more accurate and deeper pipelines for MS data analysis. Our
preliminary work and experiments suggest that the limited training search-space exhibited by labelled spectral libraries
makes robustness, and generalizability of existing ML models highly susceptible and may not effectively work for real-
world data. The overall objective of my research lab using this MIRA mechanism is to design and develop robust,
reliable, and generalizable machine-learning models for peptide deduction from MS data from omics experiments.
Our proposed work fills four key knowledge gaps in development of ML models pursued via this MIRA grant that, if
filled, will lead to superior computational techniques capable of inferring both abundant and non-abundant peptides.
Our general strategy will involve design and development of generative models, self-learning models, biologically
inspired models, and methods to infer uncertainty quantification. In addition, we will strive to focus on two key gaps in
adaptation of ML models that will be filled via developing ML-ready workflows and developing easy-to-use software
infrastructure that can be used by scientists. All this effort via MIRA grant mechanism will fill a critical gap in our
understanding and ability to deduce peptide (that are novel) and will contribute a fundamental tool for studying complex
communities in proteomics, and meta-proteomics data. At the end of this grant funding cycle, it is our expectation that
we will have designed and developed highly accurate ML peptide deduction engine capable of end-to-end analysis of
the MS based omics data– that is robust, generalizable, and more accurate than their algorithmic counterpart. Our
proposed work will facilitate reproducibility by developing ML models that perform well – irrespective of underlying MS
data quality or completeness – will be a highly impactful outcome. This proposed work will also serve as the
foundation for analysis of more complex data sets related to meta-proteomics, and proteogenomics as one of our
long-term goals that we hope to achieve using this MIRA grant mechanism."
10842833,"The importance of membrane potentials is most widely recognized in electrically excitable cells in organs
like the brain, the heart, and muscles. However, all cells maintain a membrane potential. Small
differences in these electric fields have been linked to enhanced cell signaling, differentiation,
development, control of circadian rhythms, modulation of ultradian rhythms, regulation of cell volume,
proliferation, cell cycle progression, metastatic potential of cancerous tumors, and more. Across all cell
types, up to 50% of the cellular ATP budget is spent on setting the membrane potential via the action of
the ATP-powered Na+/K+ exchanger.
Despite the massively expensive energy expenditure put out by cells to maintain this electrical potential,
a clear picture of the details of how bioelectrical signals and potentials shape physiology outside of the
brain remains elusive. The lack of readily implemented methods to reliably measure membrane
potential values has limited progress in the field of understanding how bioelectrical signals shape
cellular physiology outside of the context of the brain.
A vast ecosystem of electrical signals outside of the brain exists between and within cells. This
interconnected network has been previously inaccessible. Electrodes fall short when measuring multiple
cells or accessing intracellular membranes. Existing dyes are prone to serious artifacts that confound a
straightforward interpretation. We are developing optical methods to address these existing
shortcomings and visualize and quantify bioelectrical signals and potentials in cells and in organelles
outside of the context of the brain.
We combine approaches and methodologies from synthetic chemistry, physiology, and cell biology to
make contributions to understand the chemistry of fluorophores for live cell imaging, uncover new vistas
of cellular physiology across cells and within cells, and take translational approaches with implications
for understanding drug-ion channel interactions."

preterm birth, there is loss of both ω3 and ω6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA),
normally provided by the maternal/placental interface in utero. prominently contributes to
initiation and progression of ROP. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, ω3) alone prevents ROP in
some but not all studies. If DHA is given alone serum arachidonic acid (AA, ω6) decreases
further, and lack of AA also contributes to ROP. We must understand how DHA and AA together
prevent ROP to develop potent safe interventions based on physiology. In premature infants
developing severe ROP, decreased mitochondrial number and increased peroxisomal activity
(cleaving lipids ≥22 carbons) was found. However, knowledge of mitochondrial and peroxisomal
lipid oxidation in retinal diseases is limited. Pilot work suggests DHA and AA control
peroxisomal activity in a phase 1 ROP model. We will determine DHA/AA effects on retinal
metabolism, particularly mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation in early vessel loss
in ROP.
DHA/AA controls neurovascular development in phase 1 ROP by improving
metabolism.
In hyperglycemic mice in phase I ROP (vessel growth suppression and retinal neuronal
dysfunction) we will: i) investigate if AA adds to DHA protection against retinal neurovascular
abnormalities; ii) determine if DHA/AA alters retinal mitochondrial metabolism, and iii)
determine if DHA/AA controls peroxisomal β-fatty acid oxidation.
SUMMARY: These studies will determine if AA adds to DHA protection in phase I ROP

Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is the most common cancer globally in people living with HIV, and among the most common cancers in Sub-Saharan Africa, and is caused by infection by the Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV, also called HHV-8). This virus also causes primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD). While PEL is rare, it is an aggressive malignancy with few therapeutic options. KSHV-associated diseases are difficult to model because this virus is species-specific, it does not transform cells in in culture, in vitro infection frequently leads to a mixture of latent and lytic viral gene expression, and related animal viruses do not cause the same pathologies. Furthermore, KS lesions are composed of a mixture of cells that include latently KSHV-infected spindle cells and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate that includes numerous CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, plasma cells, macrophages, and mast cells. While substantial attention has been given to the histogenesis of the spindle cells, the immune infiltrates in KS lesions have only been superficially and incompletely described. The overarching goal is this application is develop preclinical in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models of KSHV-associated diseases, including KS, MCD and lymphoma. To model KS, we will apply observations from human lesions, and include the immune elements of this disease. This will be accomplished through the following specific aims: 1) conditional expression of major latency transcript genes in immunocompetent mice; 2) examine the tumor immune environment in KS lesions in patients and test the role of major immune subsets in mice; and 3) engineer synthetic, in vitro and ex vivo Kaposi sarcoma-like tissue niches for controlled growth of healthy and diseased primary endothelial cells. We will examine the effects of first line therapeutic approaches, targeted therapy and immunotherapy in these models to validate them for preclinical use."

The University of Minnesota Training the Next Generation of Surgeon-Scientists in Pancreatology Program will
provide independent translational science training experience in pancreatology through a team mentoring-based
program for the development of translational science projects as well as University of Minnesota Graduate
School curriculum and thesis. The program uniquely focuses on developing professional surgeon-scientists with
skills to work collaboratively with PhD and other investigators. A team comprised of an individual surgeon-
scientist and a PhD or other appropriate investigator will mentor each resident; both will provide mentorship with
the goal of developing surgeon-scientists trained in collaborative, transdisciplinary, translational research. As
part of this effort, we will expect all trainees to complete a Masters in Surgical Science. We believe that the
combination of these skills and experience within a team science setting will permit the acquisition of skills to
effectively function as a surgeon-scientist in the future. Our program areas of strength include nationally and
internationally recognized basic and translational research in the areas of acute and chronic pancreatitis,
pancreatic cancer, and pancreatic islet transplantation with active involvement in clinical practice. The Executive
Committee will provide administrative guidance to the Co-Directors in the selection of trainees and Trainee

This proposal requests the renewal of a highly successful, innovative T32 training program in Computational
Neural Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University. The mission of the Computational Neuralengineering
Training Program (CNTP) is to train the next generation of researchers at the intersection of computational
neuroscience, data science, and clinical neurophysiology. The training program addresses the opportunities
provided by the explosion of tools for measurement and manipulation of nervous system function, the challenges
posed by the growing threat of neurological diseases and disorders on an expanding senior population, and the
emerging Neurotechnology industry. The success of the CNTP has played a major role in catalyzing rapid and
recent growth in research and education in Computational Neural Engineering across Emory and Georgia Tech.
The first cycle of this funded program from 2019-2024 has catalyzed a student-centric community and
significantly enhanced the momentum of the larger Neuralengineering effort across Georgia Tech and Emory
University, resulting in numerous faculty hires, expansion of graduate (and undergraduate) communities, and a
place in the central strategic planning at both universities. Starting modestly with 4 trainees in 2019, the program
has grown and expanded to over 40 trainees, and 40+ training faculty, with a range of activities and opportunities
that otherwise would not exist. The training program provides trainees with unique opportunities to catalyze new
collaborative research through research rotations, coursework in neural engineering, computational approaches,
and clinical perspectives, and as well as interactions with our community through seminars, journal clubs,
industrial partners, and external visitors. Further, professional development and communications skills are
integral to all training elements.
Given the success of the first cycle of the program, plans are underway to expand the program in several ways,
including the cohort of trainees with additional support from NIH and GT/Emory, the leadership involvement of
newly promoted junior faculty, and growth and nurturing of student-centric training activities.
Collectively, the CNTP has catalyzed the community here at GT and Emory and is the heart of Neural

Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) is a group of over 150 diseases characterized by limited ability to
attach glycans to proteins and lipids. The most common form, loss of phosphomannose mutatase-2 activity
(PMM2-CDG), is an orphan disease affecting approximately 1500 patients worldwide. CDG typically presents as
severe disease in the first few years of life and is lethal in 20% of infantile cases. Children with PMM2-CDG have
a range of symptoms, including hypotonia, ataxia, neuropathy, severely delayed language and motor
development, inability to walk, and IQ of 40 to 70. Adult patients display mild to severe physical and mental
disabilities.
Current treatment for CDG consists only of palliative care. No therapeutic is approved for use. Replacement
therapies with monosaccharides, such as mannose-1-phosphate, galactose, fucose, as well as other dietary
supplements, have shown little efficacy in PMM2-CDG. Severity of disease is correlated with degree of enzyme
loss: <7% enzyme activity is lethal, whereas >50% activity yields no symptoms.
Maggie’s Pearl has discovered several compounds that increase the activity of the mutant PMM2 enzyme in
several models of PMM2-CDG, including fibroblasts derived from PMM2 patients. Many of these compounds are
aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs), and one of them, Epalrestat, appears to be a safe drug candidate. It has been
used for over 27 years in Japan for treatment of diabetic neuropathy in adults. However, the drug is not approved
for any indication in the US.
Maggie’s Pearl has tested Epalrestat in a single-patient trial. The young patient showed positive results after just
4 months of treatment, with no adverse effects after 18 months of Epalrestat. The proposed SBIR will expand
this study to a double blind, single-crossover trial of 30 childhood PMM2-CDG patients over the course of three
years. Similar success of Epalrestat in this trial would offer life-changing improvements for patients worldwide."

 This proposal aims to develop Bayesian subject-specific computational models of voice production in vocally
normal individuals and patients with structural voice disorders. Voice production is a complex biophysical
process, consisting of vocal fold biomechanics and sub-glottal, intra-glottal, and supra-glottal aerodynamics, as
well as their interactions. Predictive computational modeling approaches are highly needed as they provide
scientific tools for better understanding the detailed function of such a sophisticated coupled system. They can
be employed to study the normal function of voice production and investigate how it can be impacted due to an
anomaly or malfunction in the vocal fold structure or behavior. Experimental data of high-speed videoendoscopy,
electroglottography and acoustic signals will be used to design computational models of voice production,
coupling laryngeal dynamics and aerodynamics. In Aim 1, the objective is to develop Bayesian predictive models
that can capture the uncertainties inherent in the data and models. The Bayesian inference will be performed
using the high-speed videoendoscopy and electroglottography data. The models will be validated with acoustic
signals for each vocally normal participant. The model will couple the vocal fold tissue vibration (kinetics and

voice production for patients with structural voice pathologies including vocal polyps, Reinke's edema, and

external patient-specific force component will be calculated from the model for the patients, where the physical

Diabetes affects nearly 10% of the adult population (30 million), and these numbers are expected to double by
the year 2050. The pathophysiology of diabetes profoundly impairs all tissue reparative processes, leading to
chronic non-healing wounds in affected patients. Diabetic foot ulcers affect between 15-30% of all diabetic
individuals and represent the leading cause of lower limb amputations in the United States. Conventional
methods to treat diabetes, such as with insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, can control the disease but do not
prevent diabetic complications, as demonstrated by continued progressive organ dysfunction even decades after
medical optimization. This highlights a clear need for new therapeutic approaches. Over the past 15 years of
NIH funding, our laboratory has made important contributions to our understanding of the critical molecular and
cellular pathways in normal and diabetic tissue repair. We have identified hyperglycemia-related impairments in
both the local microenvironment and progenitor cell homing and cytokine production that contribute to the
pathogenesis of diabetic complications. We have demonstrated that diabetes results in depletion of critical cell
subpopulations, resulting in decreased neovascularization and impaired tissue healing. To understand the
effects of diabetes on cell population dynamics with greater precision, we have developed novel single cell
“-omics” techniques to identify critical perturbations in cell subpopulations at the single cell level. It is our
fundamental hypothesis that diabetes alters the “cellular ecology” of heterogeneous cell populations involved
in tissue repair and that normalization of those cell subpopulations can treat or reverse diabetic complications.
In this proposal, we will integrate emerging multimodal -omics technologies to definitively characterize the
behavior of cell subpopulations in diabetic complications, including wound healing. We will extend this work
therapeutically by using cell-based approaches to normalize these defects to treat and prevent diabetic
complications. To begin, we will employ a novel multiplex approach for high-throughput single cell sequencing
to definitively characterize the behavior of resident tissue and progenitor cell subpopulations in human diabetic
and non-diabetic wounds (Specific Aim 1). We will then confirm these human observations in animal models and
define these changes with spatial resolution by integrating single cell sequencing with next-generation spatial
transcriptomic and proteomic technologies and precisely delineate where in the three-dimensional wound
environment these differences exist (Specific Aim 2). Finally, we will use this information to optimize the systemic
delivery of cell-based therapeutics in order to prevent or reverse diabetes-induced defects in relevant cell
populations and thereby correct diabetic complications (Specific Aim 3). Taken together, this novel approach for
identifying, spatially characterizing, and correcting subpopulation deficits in diabetic complications will provide
new insights into diabetic pathophysiology and inform novel strategies to prevent and treat these complications."

Most women experience symptoms and sleep difficulties during perimenopause which can significantly impact
their quality of life. The severity and duration of menopausal symptoms are influenced by psychological,
biological, behavioral, and demographic factors. However, little is known about the associations of climate-
related factors, such as ambient temperature and greenness, with menopausal symptoms and sleep difficulties.
The available evidence on ambient temperature is limited to small studies which suggest that warmer
temperatures are associated with a higher frequency of hot flashes. For greenness, there have been two
longitudinal studies conducted. One found an association between higher exposure to residential surrounding
green space with older age at menopause. The second found that greenness was positively associated with
circulating anti-müllerian hormone levels, a marker of ovarian reserve, predictive of the timing of natural
menopause.
This Diversity Supplement will provide the candidate, Dr. Soria, with the additional experience, expertise, skills,
and data necessary to facilitate her goal of becoming an independent reproductive epidemiologist with expertise
in the exposome and women's health. Dr. Soria will draw upon her background and experience to examine the
associations between climate-related factors and health during the menopausal transition. Specifically, she will
investigate how exposure to ambient temperature and greenness are associated with menopausal symptoms
and sleep duration and quality in women undergoing the menopausal transition. This study will be embedded
within project 2 of the parent grant (U54 AG062322) and use data already collected in the Project Viva cohort.
Dr. Emily Oken and Dr. Jorge Chavarro, the leaders of project 2 of the parent grant, will mentor Dr. Soria. The
candidate will also receive mentorship from Dr. Elizabeth Klerman, a renowned sleep researcher, and Dr. Peter
James, a senior environmental epidemiologist. With the training, skills, and experience she will receive through
the proposed diversity supplement, Dr. Soria intends to seek an academic research position in reproductive
epidemiology."
10833197,"Mitochondrial malfunction is well known to manifest as dysfunction of neurons, due to the high
energetic demands of these highly polarized cells, their remarkable axonal length, and complexity.
However, how neuronal mitochondria precisely control crista structure in response to ever-
changing energy demands and oxidative stressors and how these regulations impact neuronal
function and behavior in multicellular organisms remain elusive. In our Preliminary Studies, we
have discovered an evolutionarily conserved role for MIC60 in maintaining crista structure in
Drosophila. We have found molecular modifications of fly MIC60 (dMIC60) including
phosphorylation and oxidation and their significance in maintaining crista junction plasticity and
resisting oxidative stress. These results demonstrate the vital importance of dMIC60 and its
posttranslational modifications for mitochondrial and neuronal homeostasis. We hypothesize that
molecular regulations of dMIC60 including phosphorylation and oxidation allow dMIC60 to receive
cellular signals to conduct its functions and that their misregulations could lead to neuronal
dysfunction and degeneration. To test this hypothesis, we will perform the following Specific Aims.
Aim 1: Roles for dMIC60 in neuronal homeostasis. Aim 2: Crista structure as a cellular
cause for oxidative damage. Aim 3: Molecular mechanisms of dMIC60 phosphorylation and
oxidation."
10832969,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common cancer arising in the adult brain, and is lethal in nearly all cases. A key
contributing factor to poor outcomes for GBM patients is a subpopulation of cells, known as cancer stem cells
(CSCs), that are highly resistant to routinely used genotoxic/cytotoxic therapies, and ultimately manifest as
recurrent tumor. Inhibiting tumor recurrence from CSCs that survive therapy would therefore improve GBM
patient outcomes. Our preliminary and recently published work show that CSC survival is dependent on Tissue
Factor (TF), a conserved transmembrane and secreted protein involved in blood clotting. TF activates protease-
activated receptor 2 (PAR2), a G-protein-coupled receptor on GBM cells, which promotes CSC maintenance
and expansion, as indicated by analysis of marker expression, self-renewal capacity, and in vivo growth of CSCs.
TF suppression greatly reduces CSC subpopulations, in some cases even leading to complete tumor eradication
in vivo. Protective and proliferative effects of TF-PAR2 signaling on CSCs appears to be through activation of
multiple classes of oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) like EGFR, although the mechanism by which
TF-PAR2-RTKs stimulate CSCs is unclear. Our preliminary data also show that TF positively correlates with
expression of Junctional Adhesion Molecule-A (JAM-A), a protein that promotes cell-cell adhesion by stabilizing
integrin β1. CSCs depend on such cell-cell adhesion, and our data show that JAM-A is necessary for CSC
behavior in GBM. Because TF can also signal through integrin β1, our overarching hypothesis is that TF
upregulates JAM-A expression, which stabilizes integrin β1 and enhances the ability of TF to act on integrin β1
and promote self-renewal in GBM. This has therapeutic relevance, because the pro-CSC effects of TF are
independent of its role in hemostasis, and blocking JAM-A could potentially reduce the pro-tumor effects of TF,
without causing bleeding that would result from targeting TF directly. In Specific Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis
that TF drives JAM-A expression through PAR2-RTK signaling. We will identify components of the TF-PAR2
complex that are essential for TF-PAR2 pro-tumor activities, and will test the ability of TF to trigger JAM-A
expression while inhibiting each major downstream pathway of RTK signaling. In Specific Aim 2, we will
determine whether JAM-A requires serpin B3, a serine-protease inhibitor that we have shown binds to JAM-A,
for its pro-CSC activities. In Specific Aim 3, we will use molecular knockouts to determine whether JAM-A is an
effective therapeutic target against aggressive, high TF-expressing GBM. Completion of this project will advance
our understanding of how CSC subpopulations are maintained in GBM, could well be applicable to a wide range
of cancers, and would demonstrate a compelling new therapeutic target in treating numerous malignancies,
including GBM."

The proposed research involves continued studies of group II intron and related reverse transcriptases (RTs),
their biological functions, reverse transcription mechanisms, and RNA-seq applications, including the analysis
of human extracellular vesicle and plasma RNAs for RNA diagnostics and liquid biopsy. Group II intron RTs
are encoded by bacterial retroelements called mobile group II introns, which are thought to be evolutionary an-
cestors of introns and retroelements in higher organisms. Group II intron RTs differ structurally and functionally
from retroviral RTs and have novel biochemical properties useful for RNA-seq and other biotechnological appli-
cations. Bacteria also encode a variety of other RTs that are closely related to group II intron RTs, including
RTs that function in RNA spacer acquisition in CRISPR-Cas systems, as well as multiple classes of free-stand-
ing RTs that have acquired cellular functions. At present, little is known about these RTs or their potential for
use in biotechnological applications. In previous work, we developed general methods for expressing group II
intron and related RTs with high yield and activity and applied these methods to group II intron RTs from bacte-
rial thermophiles to obtain Thermostable Group II Intron RTs (TGIRTs). We found that TGIRTs have higher
fidelity and processivity than retroviral RTs as well as a novel template-switching activity that enables facile
RNA-seq adapter addition. Taking advantage of these properties, we developed TGIRT-based methods for
high-throughput RNA sequencing (TGIRT-seq) that enable applications that would be difficult or impossible
with other currently available RTs, including the simultaneous profiling of nearly all RNA biotypes from small
amounts of starting material. We demonstrated the efficacy of these methods for the analysis of human cellu-
lar, extracellular vesicle, and plasma RNAs and have begun to explore their clinical applications. Additionally,
we obtained a first-of-its kind X-ray crystal structure of a full-length TGIRT in complex with template-primer and
incoming dNTP, providing a structural foundation for addressing major questions about the reverse transcrip-
tion mechanism of group II intron RTs, the evolutionary origin of RTs, and the engineering of group II intron
RTs with improved properties for biotechnological applications. In the proposed research, we will investigate
the reverse transcription mechanism and structural basis for the distinctive biochemical properties of group II
intron RTs, explore the evolutionary origin of RTs and their relationship to RNA-dependent RNA polymerases,
continue studies of CRISPR-associated RTs, and extend these studies to new classes of bacterial RTs. Fur-
ther, we will continue to develop TGIRT-seq methods and follow up key findings from our previous TGIRT-seq
analyses of human cellular, extracellular vesicle, and plasma RNAs, including the mechanism and regulation of
extracellular vesicle RNA packaging and secretion, the characterization of novel small non-coding RNAs, and
the functions of short 3’ tRNA fragments. Finally, we will continue to develop clinical applications of TGIRT-seq,
including new approaches for RNA diagnostics and liquid biopsy of cancer and other human diseases."

Status epilepticus (SE) is the most common serious neurological emergency among children worldwide. In the
low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) of sub-Saharan Africa, the burden of childhood SE-associated
mortality and morbidity appears to be especially high. However, the phenotypes of childhood SE, clinical
predictors of SE-associated mortality and of SE-associated neurodevelopmental morbidity, and genomic
predictors of SE, SE-associated mortality and neurodevelopmental morbidity have not been well-characterized
in this region. The clinical and genomic predictors of benzodiazepine-resistant SE, which is common and may
contribute to SE-associated mortality, have also not been well-characterized, especially among African
children. A large percentage of children (~80%) with SE in northern Nigeria experience SE as their first
seizure, and the estimated incidence of childhood SE in Kano is relatively high. Little is known of the clinical
and genomic risk factors for the development of epilepsy among African children who experience SE as their
first seizure. The H3Africa consortium is yielding insights into the genomic factors of common human diseases
across the African continent and and will provide controls for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of SE.
This project, Childhood Status Epilepticus and Epilepsy Determinants of Outcome (SEED), will establish a
large cohort of children with SE in Kano, northern Nigeria who present to pediatric emergency rooms in Kano.
Innovative capacity building will include the incorporation of point-of-care EEG and EEG-video in large
pediatric emergency rooms in Kano, performed by specially trained community health extension workers
(CHEWs) who will be trained in both basic epilepsy care and EEG technology. A team of specialists working
together at Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital (AKTH) and at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) will
utilize video exams, EEG-video, detailed histories, and brain MRI to perform deep phenotyping on this large
cohort of children with SE. Clinical risk factors for in-hospital SE-associated mortality, short-term SE-
associated mortality, long-term SE-associated mortality, and SE-associated neurodevelopmental morbidity will
be determined. GWAS will be performed on the entire cohort, with gender matched controls from H3Africa,
through collaborations between AKTH, Bayero University Kano, the Sydney Brenner Institute for Molecular
Bioscience in South Africa, and VUMC. Genomic risk factors for childhood SE-associated mortality and
morbidity will be determined, as well as clinical and genomic risk factors for development of epilepsy among
children who experience SE as their first seizure and clinical and genomic risk factors for benzodiazepine-
resistant SE. SEED will provide valuable insights into childhood SE in sub-Saharan Africa."
10833087,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The innate immunity is well-controlled to respond to pathogenic infection in a timely and sensitive manner, while
tolerating “self” molecules in the cell. Defects in the regulation of innate immunity result in various disorders,
such as autoimmune diseases or heightened vulnerability to infections. Previous studies by us and others re-
vealed ADAR1, an RNA editing enzyme that catalyzes Adenosine to Inosine (A-to-I) editing on dsRNAs, as a
key player in the regulation of innate immune response to double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). ADAR1 RNA editing
and binding activities have been shown to prevent endogenous (“self”) dsRNAs from activating the cytosolic
dsRNA sensors MDA5 and PKR, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. In addition,
the cytoplasmic editing of at least some dsRNAs by the ADAR1 p150 isoform is crucial to suppress the dsRNA-
mediated autoimmunity, although the ADAR1 p110 isoform in the nucleus is generally a lot more abundant. How
are these dsRNAs edited in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus?
In this MIRA application, we focus on two projects to address these knowledge gaps. First, we will elucidate the
interplay between ADAR1 and other players in the dsRNA innate immunity pathways. Specifically, we will inves-
tigate the mechanisms by which ADAR1 regulates the MDA5 and PKR pathways of dsRNA sensing. We propose
that ADAR1 regulates dsRNA-mediated innate immunity in both RNA editing-dependent and -independent fash-
ion. We will study how these two modes of action operate in vitro and test their in vivo implications in mouse
models. Second, we will uncover the regulatory mechanisms for cytoplasmic vs. nuclear editing. Specifically, we
will perform genetic screens and biochemical assays to identify and characterize the factors responsible for
spatial differences in editing. Taken together, these innovative studies will provide a deep understanding of the
molecular mechanisms operating at the interface of dsRNA editing and dsRNA sensing in innate immunity."
10833089,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Limited use of HIV services by those at highest risk is one of the primary reasons for continued HIV
transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. Identifying and engaging these individuals—particularly the 20% of people
living with HIV who are unaware of their status—is a major challenge that is not being met by existing service
delivery approaches. Men who purchase sex (MPS) are of particularly high priority because they are twice as
likely to be HIV-infected as other men and are inherently challenging to identify and reach with HIV services.
The proposed project will take place in the region of Kenya with the highest HIV prevalence and seeks to
promote engagement in HIV testing, prevention, and care by MPS. Preliminary data demonstrate that
“secondary distribution” of HIV self-tests by women who sell sex (WSS) to their sexual partners is acceptable,
feasible, and safe and leads to high male partner testing. However, the use of post–self-test services has
seldom been promoted or measured in a secondary distribution model. Our interdisciplinary and experienced
team of Investigators will address this key gap.
 Led by an Early Stage Investigator, this project will use a pair-matched cluster-randomized trial design to
test an innovative, well-targeted HIV self-test secondary distribution intervention to promote uptake of HIV
services by MPS. Clusters served by Ministry of Health–supported HIV clinics will be randomized to receive the
secondary distribution intervention or standard of care. In intervention clusters, we will recruit WSS from key
population clinics and transactional sex “hot spots.” WSS will be provided with oral fluid–based HIV self-tests
and encouraged to distribute them to their male transactional sex partners. Self-test kits will include salient
information for men on clinic location and hours within their cluster, and pilot-tested messaging on the
importance of early ART initiation, and the availability and benefits of PrEP. In Aim 1, we will evaluate
programmatic data from HIV clinics in study clusters to objectively determine the intervention’s impact on
uptake of confirmatory testing, ART initiation, and PrEP initiation by men. In Aim 2, we will conduct a process
evaluation to characterize factors influencing intervention effectiveness. We will assess secondary distribution
patterns and characterize the MPS population receiving self-tests through quantitative program data and a
follow-up questionnaire among enrolled WSS. We will use qualitative data obtained through in-depth interviews
with MPS to explore pathways and contextual factors influencing whether they accessed post-test services. In
Aim 3, we will compute the incremental cost-effectiveness of our intervention to inform decisions about broader
implementation. This project has the potential to break new ground on ways to engage high-risk and hard-to-
reach populations in HIV services. If effective, our approach could be readily adapted to other settings and help
advance global goals for HIV elimination."
10837688,"1. SUMMARY (Administrative Core)
The Stanford Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) will support goals of the National Alzheimer's
Project Act by serving as a shared resource to facilitate and enhance interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary
research on Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease related dementia (AD/ADRD). At the Stanford
ADRC, the focus will be on AD and a common ADRD, namely cognitive impairment and dementia linked to
Lewy bodies, Lewy neurites, and the abnormal accumulation and propagation of alpha-synuclein (the Lewy
body spectrum of neurodegenerative cognitive impairment). The Stanford ADRC has adopted a strategy of
deep phenotyping, which draws together multiple levels of biological data on individual participants followed
over time and culminating in brain donation. The Administrative Core provides the administrative structure
needed to direct, facilitate and support the Stanford ADRC mission. It establishes the overall scientific
direction, provides a forum for planning, ensures optimal resource utilization, and assures compliance with
institutional and NIH policy requirements. It will accomplish these goals during the next five years through four
specific aims: (1) Provide an infrastructure that establishes priorities and goals of the P30 Stanford ADRC:
coordinate activities of ADRC cores and committees; ensure compliance with reporting procedures, policies,
and guidelines of the NIH, institutional review board, and other relevant bodies; oversee data transfer to the
National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and other entities; and oversee the transfer of biological
specimens and genetic data to the National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer's Disease (NCRAD), National
Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS), and other collaborating
groups; (2) Stimulate innovative research on AD/ADRD by existing and new investigators, including the
solicitation, evaluation, selection, and monitoring of development projects supported by the Center; (3) Provide
leadership opportunities for the next generation of ADRC leaders; and (4) Promote research, training, and
educational collaborations with other ADRCs, universities, health professionals, caregiver organizations, and
the wider scientific and lay communities."
10837690,"1. SUMMARY (Clinical Core)
In support of the goals of the National Alzheimer's Project Act, the Stanford ADRC will focus on the
Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum and the Lewy body (LB) spectrum of neurodegenerative cognitive
impairment. Recognizing that critical answers will emerge more readily when investigators can delve deeply
within and across multiple levels of participant data, we have adopted a strategy of deep phenotyping. Stanford
ADRC participants are characterized intensively and followed over time. The AD spectrum includes cognitively
impaired patients with AD dementia and mild cognitive impairment due to AD, as well as preclinical AD inferred
from biomarker data. The LB spectrum encompasses dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease
dementia and Parkinson's disease patients with mild cognitive impairment. Healthy adults without cognitive or
motor impairment can serve as an age-equivalent comparison population, as an asymptomatic at-risk
population, and as a potential preclinical population in which mechanisms of cognitive aging and preclinical
transition can be studied. Within the LB spectrum, Parkinson's disease patients without cognitive impairment
serve as age-equivalent comparators and as an at-risk transitional population for the development of LB-
spectrum cognitive impairment. Stanford ADRC resources will enable the parallel study of these AD and LB
spectrum disorders. Opportunities for investigators to compare and contrast can provide unique insights into
pathogenesis, resistance and resilience, and therapeutic approaches. The Clinical Core will be responsible for
participant enrollment and for clinical, cognitive, and behavioral assessments. In support of a strategy that
emphasizes the deep phenotyping of individual participants, the Clinical Core is also responsible for
biospecimen procurement, imaging referral, and brain donation consent. It is responsible for participant
retention and for longitudinal follow-up. Most new participants in the Stanford ADRC will be asked to provide
disease-defining biomarkers measured in CSF, imaged by amyloid-PET/MRI, or both; to consent to
longitudinal follow-up; and to agree to brain donation through the Neuropathology Core. The Clinical Core will
work with other ADRC Cores to accomplish four aims focused on the AD spectrum and the LB spectrum of
neurodegenerative cognitive impairment: (1) Enroll participants into longitudinal research protocols of the
Stanford ADRC; characterize their neurological, cognitive, and behavioral status; provide consensus
diagnoses; follow participants longitudinally; and promote adherence; (2) support the efforts of other ADRC
Cores; (3) support ADRC development project grants and research needs of qualified externally funded
investigators who could benefit from Core resources; and (4) support the Research Education Component by
providing a rich training environment for medical and graduate students, residents, fellows, and junior faculty."
10837725,"Severe inequities in HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) access and use persist among Black and Latinx
communities most impacted by the HIV epidemic. The Bronx, NY, with over 90% of the population identifying
as Black or Latinx, is an Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) priority county with the fifth highest HIV diagnosis rate
in the U.S. and the lowest PrEP use in NY. Research on barriers to PrEP engagement indicate that the current
structure of PrEP access and management is not consonant with the lives, priorities, or needs of the hardest
hit communities, further exacerbating ongoing racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in HIV incidence.
Many of the same barriers leading to poor PrEP uptake in Black/Latinx communities also drive members of
these communities to seek care for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), a known risk factor for HIV, in
Emergency Departments (EDs). However, there is a discordance between the type of care likely to preserve
the long-term health of those seeking STI care in EDs (longitudinal, behavioral, and prevention-oriented) and
the care the ED is optimized to provide (acute, high intensity, life-saving/stabilizing), meaning that both patients
and health systems stand to gain from a restructuring of how STI care is delivered in EDs. Innovative, efficient,
and sustainable strategies for identifying and engaging high priority populations for HIV prevention seeking
sexual healthcare in EDs are thus needed. We therefore propose ED2PrEP, a pragmatic Type III hybrid
effectiveness-implementation trial comparing two strategies for increasing PrEP uptake among patients at risk
for HIV accessing care in Bronx EDs. The two strategies are (1) Post-Visit Outreach (PVO) involving proactive
outreach to patients following a STI-related ED visit. PVO will be initiated by a Sexual Health Navigator who
will provide PrEP education, counseling, and linkage to existing sexual health/PrEP clinics. (2) Tele-PrEP (TP)
will involve a real-time telehealth visit with a Sexual Health Provider during STI-related ED visits. TP will also
include education, counseling, and linkage, in addition to the provider’s ability to prescribe PrEP at the time of
the visit. To test the effectiveness of PVO and TP for increasing PrEP uptake among patients accessing STI
care in the ED, we will perform a crossover trial in which the strategies are implemented in two different EDs
for 9 months and then switched for another 9 months (Aim 1). Next, guided by the RE-AIM framework, we will
assess implementation outcomes for the strategies to identify how each strategy’s effectiveness is impacted by
implementation considerations (Aim 2). Finally, to inform scale-out locally and nationally, we will perform an
economic analysis to determine each strategy’s cost per outcome and relative cost-effectiveness (Aim 3).
ED2PrEP will generate critical data that could transform how EDs initiate PrEP and engage populations at the
highest risk for HIV and accelerate EHE goals in one hardest hit jurisdictions in the U.S. Findings could also be
informative to other jurisdictions, having dramatic effects on how HIV prevention is delivered."
10837824,"Project Summary/Narrative
 This K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award application investigates the
role of tau post-translational modifications on the cellular processes involved in the stereotyped spreading of
tau pathology that occurs as Alzheimer’s disease progresses. The cellular mechanisms underlying this process
include the cell-to-cell propagation of pathologic tau from a donor cell to a recipient cell, escape from the
endosomal compartment in the recipient cell, and subsequent seeding of tau aggregation in the cytoplasm.
Previous studies published in the literature, as well as preliminary data related to this project, suggest that tau
post-translational modifications, especially phosphorylations and acetylations, influence these processes.
 The overall hypothesis of the project is that tau post-translational modifications found on pathologic
tau in Alzheimer’s disease influence the cellular mechanisms involved in the spreading of tau pathology. The
specific aims of the project focus on investigating the impact of disease-associated tau post-translational
modifications on 1) the cell-to-cell propagation of tau, 2) the endosomal escape of tau, and 3) the seeding
activity of tau. The research strategy for this project uses human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived
neurons to study the processes outlined in the specific aims, and mutations mimicking post-translational
modifications (pseudophosphorylations and pseudoacetylations) will be used to assess the contribution of
defined combinations of specific residues. Specific Aim 1 uses an expression construct with the wildtype or
mutant tau sequences to identify donor and recipient cells by flow cytometry to assess cell-to-cell propagation.
Specific Aim 2 uses treatment of neurons with wildtype or mutant recombinant tau proteins and evaluation of
endosomal membrane integrity and tau endosomal escape using immunocytochemistry with galectin-3 staining
and a split luciferase assay, respectively. Specific Aim 3 uses tau Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)
biosensor cell models to detect tau seeding activity of the wildtype or mutant recombinant tau proteins or
Alzheimer’s disease-derived tau preparations with or without in vitro dephosphorylation and/or deacetylation.
 The career development plan of this proposal is designed to prepare the applicant for independence
as a scientist. The applicant will take courses that provide a conceptual framework for design, performance,
and analysis of the experiments described above. Scientific communication skills will be further developed by
coursework and experience in writing manuscripts/grants and presenting the results at scientific meetings. The
applicant had assembled a team of mentors, both the primary mentor and Scientific Advisory Board, to assist
in the applicant’s development over the course of the project. The combination of the research experience,
career development activities, and mentorship the applicant receives is designed to prepare the applicant for a
successful independent career as a physician-scientist in dementia research."

The broad, long-term goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory network
that regulates the differentiation and maintenance of articular cartilage, which plays a central role in maintaining
the low-friction environment of the joint space. Indeed, a hallmark of cells comprising the articular cartilage is
their expression of proteoglycans, such as the protein lubricin, encoded by the Prg4 gene, that lubricates the
joint and protects against the development of arthritis. Prg4 is specifically expressed in the superficial-most
layer of the articular cartilage. Findings by both the Lassar lab and others have established that Prg4-expressing
cells in the superficial zone of articular cartilage (in embryonic and early post-natal mice) serve as a stem cell
population for all deeper regions of the articular cartilage in the adult. Furthermore, in both humans and mice
lacking Prg4 (which encodes lubricin), the surface of the articular cartilage becomes damaged and precocious
joint failure occurs. Notably, decreased levels of lubricin have been observed following surgically induced
osteoarthritis in sheep, and in synovial fluid from patients with either osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.
Furthermore, a decrease in lubricin expression during aging, correlates with increasing sensitivity of aged knees
to cartilage degradation. Thus, a key objective of the Lassar lab has been to identify tissue-specific transcription
factors that regulate the expression of both Prg4 and other genes that are specifically expressed in the superficial
zone of the articular cartilage. Recent findings in the Lassar lab indicate that the transcription factor Creb5 is
uniquely expressed in superficial zone articular chondrocytes (as opposed to both deeper zone articular
chondrocytes and growth plate chondrocytes) and is a crucial regulator of Prg4 expression. Most notably, ectopic
expression of Creb5 in deep zone bovine articular chondrocytes (which do not expression Prg4) enabled TGF-b2
and EGFR signals to induce Prg4 expression in these cells, to a level equal to that expressed by superficial zone
articular chondrocytes. These findings suggest that Creb5 establishes a competent state in chondrocytes to
express Prg4 in response to these signaling pathways. In addition, the Lassar lab has found that mice engineered
to lack functional Creb5 fail to form many synovial joints. Taken together, these findings indicate that Creb5
plays a critical role in both the formation of synovial joints and is a both a novel and crucial regulator of
Prg4/lubricin expression in articular chondrocytes. This project will determine the role of Creb5 in maintaining
the health of all tissues in the mature synovial joint; will determine whether expression of Creb5 in either
articular chondrocytes or synovial fibroblasts is attenuated during aging or during osteoarthritis; and finally will
determine whether sustained expression of exogenous Creb5 in the synovial joint can boost lubricin expression
and block degradation of this tissue either during aging or in a murine model for post-traumatic osteoarthritis."

This implementation science R01 study aims to test a scale-up package to expand the delivery of pre-exposure
prophylaxis (PrEP) for pregnant and postpartum women in Kenya. The pregnancy and postpartum periods are
high risk for HIV acquisition. PrEP is an effective, woman-controlled, evidence-based intervention that is
recommended during pregnancy in high risk regions in both World Health Organization and Kenyan guidelines.
Delivery of PrEP integrated into maternal and child health (MCH) clinics is feasible, acceptable, and preferable
to pregnant and postpartum women. Our team has led 3 implementation science (PIs: John-Stewart, Baeten,
Kinuthia, Wagner) studies with >55 facilities focused on delivering PrEP integrated into MCH, testing
implementation strategies to optimize delivery in western Kenyan counties. These represented the first and
largest projects to deliver PrEP integrated into MCH. Integrated PrEP delivery is now ready for scale up more
broadly, which will require new implementation strategies to target scale up. The proposed R01 will leverage the
experiences of health care workers (HCW), expertise from research team members, and heterogeneity between
sites and counties, to develop and test a package of scale-up strategies for improving PrEP delivery. This
project’s aims are to: 1) develop and determine the impact of a Community of Practice (CoP) on stakeholder and
health care worker engagement and knowledge, 2) determine the impact of a 3 component scale up package –
CoP, quality improvement, and training & delivery toolkit – on implementation outcomes and PrEP clinical
outcomes, and 3) identify combinations of facility- and regional-level attributes and processes that explain
patterns of implementation. These research aims follow directly from Dr. Wagner’s K01 on which Dr. Kinuthia is
a mentorship member. The joint leadership between the University of Washington and Kenyatta National
Hospital provide a superb research environment for implementation science projects, with a strong >35 year
history of collaboration between the institutions. The established investigative team includes expertise in
implementation science, PrEP, HIV prevention during pregnancy and postpartum, engagement with Ministry of
Health, mixed-methods, configurational analyses, and strong expertise in delivery of PrEP in MCH."

12 outstanding Ph.D. students per year, plus at least one student for a combined Pharm.D./Ph.D. degree.
Underrepresented minority students are actively recruited through a number of faculty activities and represent
20% of our students. Upon graduation, the new PSPG Ph.D. scientist will have the ethics, knowledge and tools
necessary to become independent researchers, and also the passion and enthusiasm to make impactful
contributions to the pharmaceutical sciences and pharmacogenomics field throughout their career."
10837731,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Most pathogens enter the body at mucosal surfaces, yet, to date, the majority of licensed vaccines are injected
parenterally, predominantly intramuscularly. While excellent at eliciting systemic immunity, they do not always
induce the required mucosal immune responses. This highlights a gap in our understanding of how non-mucosal
immunization might be manipulated to elicit mucosal immune responses and how such knowledge could be
exploited to create better vaccines against mucosal pathogens. Defining the role that adjuvants play in this
response is key to developing such vaccines; however, the mechanisms that dictate adjuvant driven mucosal
antibody and cellular immune responses are not well understood. Our published work and preliminary
experiments using major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) and II (MHCII) and B cell tetramers to
examine mucosal immune responses after intradermal immunization with a novel detoxified bacterial ADP-
ribosylating enterotoxin, called dmLT, demonstrate that we can retarget the endogenous T and B cell immune
responses to the lung, intestinal mucosa, and female reproductive tract (FRT). When dmLT is combined with a
safe, bacterial-derived outer membrane vesicle (OMV) adjuvant, CD4 T cell numbers and vaccine-specific
antibodies and B cells are even further increased. Simultaneously, OMV adjuvant induces significant expansion
of vaccine-specific CD8 T cells. Furthermore, immunization with dmLT- or OMV-adjuvanted vaccines elicits
protection against bacterial infections in the lung and gut. These results lead us to hypothesize that intradermal
immunization with combined dmLT plus OMVs will drive antigen-specific B cells and T cells to the mucosa and
enhance vaccine protection against mucosal pathogens. We propose to: 1) determine how intradermal
immunization with dmLT combined with OMV adjuvant directs 1) T cells and 2) B cells to mucosal tissue and
whether these cells are bona fide tissue resident memory cells. In parallel, we will 3) examine if immunization
with dmLT-OMV adjuvanted vaccines is protective against mucosal viral and bacterial infections in the lung, gut
and FRT. This investigation will provide novel insights into how adjuvants regulate immunity at the mucosa and
allow us to guide the response in favor of pathogen elimination."

anxiety, and are more susceptible for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, such as frontotemporal
degeneration. TBI models have typically not focused on complex attentional impairments, which are
common in most TBIs, such as deficits of sustained attention, goal-directed behavior, and cognitive flexibility.
The cholinergic system is an important modulator of cognition, with nicotinic receptors (nACHRs) found
throughout the brain. The α7 receptors play important roles in attention, working memory, reward, as well as in
neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory pathways. Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of α7 nAChRs are
novel and promising therapeutic tools that can potentiate α7 currents in the presence of endogenous
acetylcholine, display high receptor selectivity, and may provide neuroprotective effects. Type I PAMs enhance
agonist-evoked peak currents without delaying desensitization and do not reactivate desensitized receptors.
Therefore, this New/Early Stage Investigator R01 application aims to a) assess cognitive-behavioral
and anxiety-like dimensions sensitive to both TBI and aging, b-c) evaluate potential benefits of
subacute (7 days) and chronic (4 weeks) administration of NS 1738, a Type I PAM, alone or in
combination with abbreviated environmental enrichment (EE), a preclinical rehabilitation model, on
attentional dysfunction after TBI in young adult and aged rats, as well as d) address mechanistic
questions regarding altered cholinergic neurotransmission responsible for such behavioral deficits by
investigating proteomic and neurotransmitter regulation markers in relevant brain regions. Specifically,
the aims are designed to 1) evaluate interactions of moderate parietal TBI and aging on sustained attention (3-
choice serial reaction time task), cognitive flexibility (attentional set-shifting test), and anxiety-like responses
(elevated plus-maze test), 2) assess age-dependent effects of the combined approach of NS 1738 treatment
and abbreviated EE (4hrs daily) to restore neurobehavioral function, as well as test receptor selectivity by
blocking α7 nAChRs with methyllycaconitine, 3) quantitate proteomic profiling using mass spectrometry to
identify key biomarkers (tissue and serum) correlating with neurobiological responses to aging, brain trauma,
and treatment paradigms, and 4) measure brain markers of cholinergic transmission (e.g., choline
acetyltransferase, acetylcholinesterase, vesicular cholinergic transporter, α7 nAChRs), as they correlate with
neurobehavior. Studies will employ both male and normal cycling female rats, as women represent up to 45%
of TBIs, with injuries occurring independent of menstrual cycles. Integrating animal models of higher-order
attention after TBI, as well as assessing pharmacotherapy- and rehabilitation-related cholinergic and proteomic

Reduced islet β cell number and function underlie the progression of all forms of diabetes. It is therefore essential
for all laboratories investigating causes and potential cures for diabetes to be able to study islet function in
relation to their specific models and molecules of interest. The objective of the Islet Cell Biology Core (ICBC) is
to provide DRC members with state of the art support including experiment design, islet isolation, and
performance of and/or training in an expansive range of assays for physiological and morphometric assessment
of pancreatic islet function and growth. This will be accomplished through four Aims: Aim 1: To provide islet
isolation service and training: We will continue to offer islet isolation services using rodent animal models.
Depending on the needs of specific investigators, the ICBC provides training for graduate students, postdoctoral
fellows and research staff in pancreatic islet isolation techniques. Aim 2: To provide state of the art assays for
physiological assessment of islet function: We will continue to provide consultation on experimental design and
to offer a broad range of assays of pancreatic islet function, including batch incubation and perifusion, islet and
cell fluorescence imaging (Cai2+), mitochondrial function assays by Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer,
perifusion coupled with respirometry, and closed respirometry. We will continue to provide access and
instruction for quantitative imaging of pancreatic islet mass. The ICBC provides training in perfusion techniques,
in basic principles of respiration and oxidative phosphorylation and measurement of oxygen consumption by
different methods, and in all aspects of islet cell physiology and biochemistry. Aim 3: To pursue procedural and
equipment advances: We will support the studies of collaborators at Penn and CHOP involving human islets
affected by a range of pathophysiological conditions. We will also adapt our technology and expertise to the
analysis of non-islet, metabolically relevant tissues, reflecting the complex, intercommunicating, multi-organ
control required to maintain normal glucose homeostasis. Technological advances will include new equipment
acquisitions and the investigation of cell function, signaling and bioenergetics in α cell enriched pseudoislets.
Aim 4: To continue to offer a unique Electrophysiology Resource: Prompted by the research needs of DRC
investigators and recognizing the preeminent role that ion channels play in physiology and pathology of
pancreatic islet cells, during the previous cycle we established a successful collaboration with our Physiology
Department, widely acknowledged for excellence in cell membrane biophysics, to provide expert consultation
and experimental services in this crucial aspect of pancreatic islet cell biology and disease. In sum, the Islet Cell
Biology Core is well aligned with the overall goals of the DRC, enabling investigators to perform state of the art
basic and clinical research. Correlation of our phenotypic analysis performed on genetically altered or
metabolically challenged mice or human source material with in vivo metabolic phenotyping and high throughput

10845593,"The Radioimmunoassay and Biomarkers Core proposes to continue offering an increasing number of high-
quality immunoassay and biochemistry services to our evolving group of Diabetes Research Center (DRC) basic,
translational, and clinical scientists. Services over the last cycle have included radioimmunoassay (RIA),
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), multiplex ELISA on the Luminex platform, high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) on the ThermoFisher platform, metabolite assays on the Yellow Springs Instruments
(YSI) platform, and most recently multiplex ELISA on the ELLA platform for an expanding variety of diabetes and
metabolism related hormones, cytokines, and metabolites derived from blood, urine, salivary and tissue samples.
These assay services have proven essential for current research in the DRC and Penn’s Institute for Diabetes,
Obesity & Metabolism (IDOM) and will remain an integral part of the future operation and development of the
Center and Institute. In the next cycle the RIA/Biomarkers Core will continue existing immunoassay serives
including RIA that are essential for cost feasibility of high sample number experiments, and expand services
beyond RIA, ELISA, Luminex, HPLC, and YSI platforms to include development of assays on a more sensitive
multiplex platform based on microfluidic ELISA (ELLA). ELLA technology will be used to implement accurate
multiplexing of cytokines with enhanced sensitivity and an expanded dynamic range required for understanding
the intersection of inflammation and metabolism in rodent and human studies, and so enhance the value of our
expanding assay services for DRC investigators. In addition, the Core will proactively engage in outreach to the
local research community of diabetes, obesity and metabolism investigators, while enhancing the QA/QC/QM of
the assay services provided. In addition, the RIA/Biomarkers Core will integrate delivery of new and existing
assay services to an expanding base of investigators via shared resources within the Smilow Center for
Translational Research. The Core is located on the 12th floor in IDOM and in near proximity to the Islet Cell
Biology, Functional Genomics, and Rodent Metabolic Phenotyping Cores that fosters close interactions among
these DRC Cores. The integrated delivery of assay services provided by the Core will be enhanced by further
development of informatics infrastructure for ordering, tracking, billing and delivery of service using iLab. The
performance of a large number of RIAs and ELISAs in a central core facility rather than in scattered locations
throughout the University provides a significant overall savings in equipment, personnel effort, and supplies for
our investigators, while importantly allowing for the generation of results with better quality due to our enhanced
quality control/quality assurance/quality management (QA/QC/QM) processes. We will continue collaborations
with other NIH-sponsored core resources and the School of Medicine at Penn in order to enhance and expand
the number of services available to our investigators, increase efficiency and technical expertise in the provision
of assay services, and continue to improve our throughput and data quality."
10840316,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Sepsis is a leading cause of death. It is also a major driver of antibiotic utilization, in large part because
current guidelines and mandates compel clinicians to administer antibiotics immediately for all patients with
possible sepsis even though more than a third of patients initially suspected to have sepsis turn out to have
viral or non-infectious conditions. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) “SEP-1” measure, for
example, requires hospitals to give broad-spectrum antibiotics within 3 hours of to all patients with suspected
sepsis as well as measure lactate levels, draw blood cultures, and administer at least 30cc/kg of fluids for
hypotension. Newer guidelines are pushing for even faster antibiotic administration and bundle completion.
Aggressive, rigid, and reflexive sepsis care may therefore benefit some patients but also unnecessarily risks
promoting antibiotic resistance, drug adverse events, C.difficile infections, and fluid overload in others.
 A major barrier to providing appropriate sepsis care to the right patients is our limited understanding of
which specific clinical presentations are most likely to benefit from immediate antibiotics and which can safely
be managed more conservatively. Similarly, we have imperfect understanding of which specific processes of
care are critical to optimize outcomes and which are not. To address these gaps, we need a better way to
define sepsis “time zero,” a concept that embodies both the criteria that should trigger immediate interventions
when infection is suspected and the point from which timeliness of care is measured. The current definition of
sepsis includes a heterogeneous mix of clinical signs, some of which are clearly urgent and some that may
tolerate more time for investigation before administering antibiotics. The problem is compounded by the fact
that SEP-1's time zero definition is subjective and labor-intensive to abstract, undermining its credibility and
utility for benchmarking hospitals' quality of care.
 In this project, we propose to leverage detailed electronic health record data from millions of encounters
from 167 hospitals in two datasets to develop more evidence-based sepsis time zero criteria and quality
metrics. These goals are reflected our Specific Aims: 1) Develop evidence-based, objective, and electronically
computable definitions of sepsis time zero by using electronic health record data to identify the clinical signs
that are associated with higher mortality when antibiotics are delayed, 2) Systematically evaluate the
associations between each sepsis bundle component and mortality and compare the full bundle to simpler,
streamlined versions, and 3) Assess whether and how optimal treatment strategies differ for commonly
encountered and easily recognizable sepsis phenotypes based on infection site, comorbidities, and clinical
signs. This proposal directly addresses the antibiotic stewardship focus of AHRQ's HAI Prevention Portfolio
and AHRQ's mission to improve health care safety and quality by providing new insights into identifying and
treating sepsis, informing more rational antibiotic use, and facilitating better measurement of quality-of-care.

10840317,"Project Summary
The brain translates internal representations of the external world into appropriate behaviors. Elucidation of
how sensory information is propagated through hierarchical systems is an important step towards
understanding how the brain instructs behavior. The sense of smell is a tractable model because the pathways
from the nose to associational cortex and emotional structures in the amygdala are relatively concise. Innate
behaviors are stereotypical between animals and likely result from genetically determined and conserved
circuits, making them a tractable model. Our past work has revealed circuits in the cortical amygdala (plCoA)
that mediate innate attraction and aversion to odor. Understanding how the sense organ is wired to the brain to
produce behaviors of different valence is an important biological problem and may provide insight into
emotional responses to sensory stimulation. We have combined anatomical tracing with functional
manipulations to reveal two outputs of the plCoA, the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and medial amygdala (MeA),
that are capable of eliciting approach and avoidance responses, respectively. Further, we have evidence to
suggest that there is a topographic organization to the plCoA circuitry. Thus, we hypothesize that the plCoA
contains topographically organized labeled lines to impart valence on odor-evoked behaviors.
 The goal of this proposal is decipher the plCoA circuitry and its connections to the NAc and MeA. We
have demonstrated that the cortical amygdala projections to NAc and MeA are able to generate approach and
avoidance behaviors. Moreover, these projection neurons appear to be distinct from each other. We propose a
model whereby the plCoA sends projections to the NAc to signal positive valence, and to medial amygdala to
signal aversion. We will employ a combination of behavioral experiments, viral tracing, genetics and
endoscopic imaging of neuronal activity to answer three fundamental questions: 1) Do the plCoA projections to
NAc and MeA mediate odor-evoked behaviors? 2) How are the plCoA projection neurons anatomically
organized? 3) Do these projection neurons and their downstream targets exhibit odor tuning for valence? The
answers to these questions will fill a knowledge gab about the representation of odor in the innate pathway and
extend this pathway deeper into the brain towards behavioral output."

Stigma is a pervasive barrier to HIV testing and PrEP use among US Latino men who have sex with men (LMSM).
Routine HIV testing and large scale PrEP coverage are essential HIV prevention strategies for ending the HIV
epidemic. LMSM further contend with intersectional stigma, meaning they experience or fear unjust treatment
from others due to their ethnic, sexual, and masculine identities (i.e. adherence to masculinity norms). Specific
to intersectional stigma, emerging quantitative research suggests exposure to stigma towards >1 intersectional
identity is associated with worse health outcomes than exposure to stigma towards a single intersectional
identity. While research on intersectional stigma has been largely qualitative, advanced quantitative methods
offer an opportunity to identify novel actionable intervention mechanisms and targets; improving our public health
response to ending the US HIV epidemic. Social network analysis is a robust method for examining how LMSM
interact with and are affected by others in their social network. Social networks are important intervention targets,
since network members are capable of (1) stigmatizing LMSM (i.e. stigma sources) and (2) fostering resilience
and social support to reduce the negative impact of intersectional stigma on LMSM’s HIV testing and PrEP use.
The current study will prospectively assess how anticipated and enacted intersectional stigma are experienced
by LMSM in their social networks at baseline to effect HIV testing and PrEP use 12-months post-baseline. We
will recruit 500 HIV-negative adult LMSM from MSM and Latino community organizations. Study measures,
including an egocentric social network inventory, will be collected at Months 0, 6, and 12. Our primary outcomes,
HIV testing and PrEP use, will be abstracted from medical records at Month 12. We will use social network
analysis to: (1) Identify how LMSM experience intersectional stigma in their social networks across diverse social
context (i.e. types of social relationships [e.g. family, friends, sex partners, providers], expression of intersectional
identities [e.g. acculturation, outness, masculinity]) (AIM 1, primary). (2) Prospectively evaluate the effect of
social network exposure to intersectional stigma on HIV testing and PrEP use (AIM 2, primary). (3) Identify novel
points of intervention to reduce the harmful effects of intersectional stigma on HIV testing and PrEP use (AIMS
3-4, exploratory) and develop data–and–community-informed intervention strategies for future piloting.
As the first study to use social networks to evaluate the effects of intersectional stigma on health outcomes,
NEXUS is significant because new HIV diagnoses among US LMSM are increasing–due to low rates of HIV
testing (undiagnosed HIV) and PrEP use–while new diagnoses among non-LMSM have stabilized or decreased.
A SN approach to studying intersectional stigma is highly innovative because it reflects a substantial departure
from how intersectional stigma has been studied, opening new opportunities to end the HIV epidemic. Without
such efforts, intersectional stigma will persist in producing and maintaining HIV disparities among LMSM."

This longstanding R01, reviewed for the past 25 years in study section PTHE, has investigated the pathogenesis
of blastomycosis with an emphasis on the causative fungus Blastomcyes dermatitidis. While pathogenesis of B.
dermatitidis infection is still our focus, we now investigate the immunopathogenesis of B. dermatitidis infection.
In the last funding cycle, we uncovered a unique susceptibility to B. dermatitidis infection in the Hmong population
of Wisconsin. We discovered that an Interleukin 6 (IL-6) defect in patients underpins their impaired immunity and
susceptibility to B. dermatitidis, and we modeled the scenario during murine infection. In patients, we traced the
underlying molecular mechanism of this IL-6 defect to polymorphisms in the gene that affect the long non-coding
RNA (lncRNA), IL6-AS1. We have now generated compelling preliminary data with induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSC) from patients and healthy control subjects that have been gene-edited. The data support our model
that impaired resistance to B. dermatitidis in susceptible hosts like the Hmong population results from altered/im-
paired IL6-AS1 lncRNA regulation of IL-6 expression. This defect in turn impairs development of acquired re-
sistance to B. dermatitidis mediated by Th17 cells. Here, we propose three aims that will uncover the poorly
understood mechanism of action of IL6-AS1 in regulating IL-6 gene expression, decipher how IL6-AS1 polymor-
phisms in the Hmong alter the function of IL6-AS1 and expression of IL-6, and analyze the downstream conse-
quence on the function, phenotype and gene expression of T cells that help resist B. dermatitidis infection. Our
work has implicaitons for understanding the basis of susceptibility to B. dermatifidis and other infectious diseases,
including COVID, that hinge on proper regulation and tuning of IL-6 production."

biology and mechanics with the ultimate aim of developing future leaders in orthopedic- and rheumatology-
related research. The program emphasizes research training in joint health, encompassing five major
programmatic areas: osteoarthritis and cartilage, total joint replacement, bone disease and regeneration, spine
degeneration, and small molecule therapeutics. Dr. Rick Sumner (Anatomy & Cell Biology) will serve as the
principal investigator with Dr. Markus Wimmer (Orthopedic Surgery) and Dr. Rachel Miller (Internal Medicine-
Rheumatology) as the co-directors. We are requesting support for two predoctoral, three postdoctoral fellows
and three short-term trainees. Joint health is a theme that connects many departments at Rush, offering an
environment and intellectual capital available to trainees that is unique in the nation. The multidisciplinary
training that is offered integrates the research endeavors of scientists in basic science and clinical departments
with clinician investigators, caregivers, and educators who specialize in musculoskeletal disease and joint
health. The training themes for this grant represent the strengths of the preceptors who have been selected as
mentors. Training will take place in the laboratories of 28 faculty in 3 basic science departments (Anatomy &
Cell Biology, Microbial Pathogens & Immunity and Physiology & Biophysics), 3 clinical departments (Internal
Medicine, Orthopaedic Surgery and Pediatrics) and one center (Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center). There are
currently 15 predoctoral students and 27 postdoctoral fellows in the training grant faculty labs. The 28 faculty
are principal investigators on grants totaling nearly $20M in annual direct costs, mainly from NIH grants. We
will continue to make every effort to recruit candidates with clinical training into our program. One means to
encourage interest among clinical trainees is to provide meaningful introductory research experiences,
justifying the continuance of our request for short-term trainee positions, which so far have been exclusively
used by medical students in our program. There is a deep history of collaborative research among
musculoskeletal researchers at Rush. We will take advantage of a reorganized Graduate College, a very
strong mentoring program and an active postdoctoral research society that has created a vibrant community
for trainees. Trainees will focus on knowledge acquisition, skill development, communications, professionalism,
leadership and management skills, and responsible conduct of research. Each mentee, his/her primary advisor
and thesis or mentoring committee will use individual development plans to guide their efforts with a focus on
publishing and participating in national research meetings and submitting independent grants (F31’s for the
predocs and F32’s for the postdocs). We anticipate that trainees will be assigned to the T32 for two years with
the expectation that support will transfer to individual awards or their preceptors’ grants. After completing our
program, we expect the trainees to continue their career path as independent, team-oriented, investigators."

 Notch signaling both positively and negatively regulates differentiation and function of
osteoclasts, and signaling through the different Notch receptors is modulated through
glycosylation first by Protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1) and then by members of the
Fringe family of N-acetylglucosaminyl transferases. Multiple positions of the Notch extracellular
domain are subject to O-fucose extension by Fringes, and different Fringes (LFNG, MFGN, and
RFNG) demonstrate differences in both patterns of glycosylation and alteration in ligand-specific
receptor activation. Osteoclasts and their precursors express multiple Notch receptors and
ligands as well as all three Fringes, and this project will study the combinatorial effect of these
Fringes on activation of Notch receptors and resultant osteoclast formation and function. The
overall hypothesis for this study is combinations of Fringe-catalyzed glycosylation modulate
Notch signaling intensity and varying levels of Notch signaling produce either pro- or anti-
osteoclast effects. This will be tested in 2 specific aims. In aim 1, contributions of individual
Fringes will be investigated through targeted overexpression and knockdown followed by
quantification of Notch1 and Notch2 activation, osteoclast differentiation and activity, and
determination of Notch1 and Notch2 receptor glycosylation patterns. In aim 2, the relationship
between level of Notch signaling and osteoclast differentiation will be investigated through tuned
expression of active Notch1 and Notch2 intracellular domains in pre-osteoclasts followed by
high throughput RNA sequencing to determine patterns of Notch-regulated gene expression and
resultant level of osteoclast differentiation. Completion of this work will deepen understanding of
Notch modulation of osteoclast formation and function specifically, but also contribute to general
mechanisms of Notch signaling and the combinatorial effects of Fringe-mediated glycosylation.
In the long term, this knowledge may contribute to the development of new bone-preserving
therapies based on modulation, rather than total inhibition, of osteoclast activity."

Social dysfunction is an intractable problem in a wide spectrum of psychiatric illnesses, undermining patients’
capacities for employment, independent living, and maintaining meaningful relationships. Identifying common
markers of social impairment across disorders and understanding their mechanisms are prerequisites to
developing targeted neurobiological treatments that can be applied productively across diagnoses and illness
stages to improve functional outcome. This project focuses on eye gaze perception, the ability to accurately
and efficiently discriminate others’ gaze direction, as a potential biomarker of social functioning that cuts across
psychiatric diagnoses. This premise builds on both the monkey and human literatures showing gaze perception
as a basic building block supporting higher-level social communication and social development, and reports of
abnormal gaze perception in multiple psychiatric conditions accompanied by prominent social dysfunction
(e.g., psychosis-spectrum disorders, autism-spectrum disorders, social phobia). A large sample (n= 225) of
adolescent and young adult (age 14-30) psychiatric patients (regardless of diagnosis) with various degrees of
impaired social functioning, and 75 demographically matched healthy controls will be recruited for this study.
Participant’s psychiatric phenotypes, cognition, social cognition, and community functioning will be
dimensionally characterized. Eye gaze perception will be assessed using a psychophysical task, and two
metrics (precision, self-referential bias) that respectively tap into gaze perception disturbances at the visual
perceptual and interpretation levels, independent of general deficits, will be derived using Bayesian modeling.
A subset of the participants (150 psychiatric patients, 75 healthy controls) will additionally undergo multimodal
fMRI to determine the functional and structural brain network features of altered gaze perception. The specific
aims of this project are three fold: Aim 1) Determine the generality of gaze perception disturbances in
psychiatric patients with prominent social dysfunction; 2) Map behavioral indices of gaze perception
disturbances to dimensions of psychiatric phenotypes and core functional domains; and 3) Identify the neural
correlates of altered gaze perception in psychiatric patients with social dysfunction. Successfully completing
these specific aims will identify the specific basic deficits, clinical profile, and underlying neural circuits
associated with social dysfunction that can be used to guide targeted, personalized treatments, thus advancing
NIMH’s Strategic Objective 1 (describe neural circuits associated with mental illnesses and map the
connectomes for mental illnesses) and Objective 3 (develop new treatments based on discoveries in
neuroscience and behavioral science)."

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative, aerobic/facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped
bacterium that is commonly found in freshwater environments. However, P. aeruginosa can
become an opportunistic pathogen, causing increased morbidity and mortality in
immunocompromised hosts, burn victims, and cystic fibrosis patients. For example, more than
two million people are infected by P. aeruginosa annually, resulting in almost 90,000 deaths.
Notably, the environmental versatility of P. aeruginosa, its multiple mechanisms for providing
antibiotic resistance, and its wide range of dynamic defenses (e.g., biofilm formation), render P.
aeruginosa a most challenging organism to effectively treat, even in today’s hospital settings.
The genes responsible for P. aeruginosa virulence are regulated by a host of sequence-specific
transcription factors. Unfortunately, our knowledge regarding their transcriptional regulatory
networks and how they can be modulated is woefully incomplete. Our laboratory has developed
an iterative selection method, Restriction Endonuclease Protection Selection and Amplification
(REPSA), that has proven highly successful in identifying consensus DNA binding sequences
and target gene promoters for a variety of transcription factors in bacteria such as Escherichia
coli and Thermus thermophilus. We now propose to use REPSA to identify the binding sites and
genes regulated by the MerR-family of transcription factors in P. aeruginosa, which are thought
to be involved in mediating responses to environmental stimuli, e.g., oxidative stress, heavy
metals, and antibiotics, involved in pathogenesis. Ultimately, such studies will illuminate global
regulatory networks in this important pathogen, thereby facilitating the development of novel
anti-P. aeruginosa therapeutics.
Notably, per the goals of the SuRE award mechanism, this project will support the research
activities of the PI, a former NIH grant recipient, and will enhance the training opportunities of
undergraduate and master’s graduate students at a primarily undergraduate/majority-minority
institution, a major focus for the PI. An award will allow the PI to continue a record of training
students who have gone on to further biomedical education in graduate or professional schools
and/or pursuing careers in STEM industries. It will also allow the PI to apply the skills honed
through continuous NSF-funded basic research to questions of direct relevance for human
health."

This competitive renewal application investigates how critical genes and pathways that determine renal
epithelial cell differentiation, growth, and survival contribute to normal renal physiology and recovery from
acute kidney injury. During previous funding periods, we have made significant breakthroughs in defining the
mechanisms of Pax2 protein function in development and disease. Interactions between Pax proteins and
epigenetic writers can imprint epithelial specific fates during development. In adults, the related gene Pax8 is
expressed in all epithelial cells, whereas Pax2 is restricted to collecting ducts in the inner and outer medulla.
How these two proteins function redundantly to control urine concentration and water resorption in the medulla
will be defined using genetic, whole genomic, and cell biological methods. Preliminary data strongly indicate
an essential role of Pax2/8 for the expression of urea, water, and ion channels. Furthermore, the function of
Pax2 and Pax8 in recovery form acute renal injury will be examined in targeted mutants and animal model of
ischemia reperfusion and nephrotoxicity. We propose that Pax genes are central to driving recovery in
proximal tubules by promoting dedifferentiation of surviving cells, re-entry into mitosis, and resetting of
epigenetic marks essential for maintaining a renal cell phenotype. Whole genome and transcriptome analyses,
coupled to single cell methods, will delineate specific genes and pathways activated and repressed by Pax
proteins during recovery such that novel potential targets for therapy may be illuminated."
10850217,"Project Summary/Abstract
The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) is requesting a Zeiss LSM900 laser scanning confocal
microscope. This instrument will replace an obsolete Zeiss LSM710 microscope installed in 2009, which is no
longer supported by the manufacturer, and is at risk of failing. If that system were to fail, its current usage levels
could not be fully accommodated on equivalent instrumentation at UNC-CH, jeopardizing multiple NIH-funded
research projects. The Zeiss LSM900 is a modern, reliable instrument that has the necessary capabilities to
support projects in the laboratories in this submission’s User Group. This Group consists of 21 laboratories,
arrayed in 11 Departments across two Schools (Medicine, Arts and Sciences), with over $30,300,000 in active
NIH funding. All these laboratories are associated with the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, and
conduct research whose discoveries can benefit public health.
This laser scanning confocal microscope will allow researchers to easily obtain images of biological specimens
with high contrast, by removing out-of-focus light using a confocal pinhole. The Zeiss LSM900 model is the best
option for the User Group given its demonstrated capabilities, reliability, cost-effectiveness, and the extensive
experience of the User Group and core facility staff with its software and hardware, all of which are documented
in detail in this submission. The microscope will be outfitted with the following optional components: a motorized
stage, a transmitted light detector, and three sensitive GaAsP detectors. These components are essential to
meet the needs of the User Group.
The University is requesting $261,741 in Federal Funds, which it will supplement with $63,181 from internal
sources to extend the warranty upon purchase to the maximal amount allowable by the manufacturer (5 years).
This microscope will be placed in the Microscopy Services Laboratory, a recharge core facility with a 30+ year
history supporting the microscopy needs of the UNC-CH community. The core is strongly supported by the
University, has personnel with demonstrated expertise in the type of instrument being requested, a strong track
record training and assisting researchers, and a large, broad, and active user base of more than a hundred labs
and several hundred researchers.
We expect this instrument will rapidly become an essential component of the shared microscopy infrastructure
at UNC-CH that will catalyze major discoveries across multiple subject areas."
10850431,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Underrepresentation of researchers from marginalized groups (racial, ethnic, disability, gender, economic, and
geographic groups) is noteworthy in the United States impacting biomedical research. This happens due to (1)
financial limitations preventing completion of training, (2) a lack of mentorship, (3) inadequate preparation due
to systemic inequities, (4) a lack of awareness about conduct of research and research careers, and (5) a lack
of STEM identity and sense of belonging that are critically important for retention. Our team from Sam Houston
State University (SHSU) will address these challenges by implementing a robust Science Trainees Advancing
Through Research and Scholarship (STARS) program for the students underrepresented in the biomedical
sciences (UBS). We will leverage our infrastructure and experience in social mobility, student engagement, and
research capacity building to increase matriculation in UBS groups leading to enrollment in the PhD programs.
The overall mission of the STARS program is to provide a unique training experience to UBS students by
accomplishing three aims. First, we will implement the multipronged STARS program for preparing
underrepresented undergraduate students for biomedical PhD programs targeting 90% of the trainees
graduating within 6 years and 66% admitted into a PhD or MD/PhD program within 2 years of graduation.
Second, we will improve the mentoring environment at SHSU through professional training and supervision of
research projects involving UBS students. Third, the program will benefit STARS trainees and other students
on campus by exposing them to and preparing them for an array of biomedical careers through seminars, internal
and external laboratory rotations, and a cluster of training activities necessary for PhD admission. Recruitment
activities will provide information at university-wide events for the STARS program and provide first-year students
with guides to accessing undergraduate research. The STARS program is innovative since the trainees will
receive strong financial and mentoring support in addition to opportunities to participate in rigorous programs of
research, academic enhancements, skill development, and career training. The 3-year program will encompass
two highly-effective summer research opportunities – one external exposure in one of three outstanding
research-intensive partner programs and a second internal summer experience focusing on interdisciplinary
research training outside of their primary major. The trainees will have the flexibility to select one of the three
training programs (1) a formal training program in bioinformatics, computational biology, and machine learning,
(2) mentored translational research experience with one of our College of Osteopathic Medicine faculty, or (3)
mentored research in another program mentor’s lab in one of the following areas – molecular and developmental
biology, microbiology biochemistry, genetics, toxicology, epidemiology, or nutrition. To ensure a high-quality
STARS program, trainees and their mentors will be continually and systematically assessed by an evaluation
expert to accomplish the goals and be responsive to formative evaluations to modify program activities, if needed."

Genetic variants explain and offer insights into the development of various complex diseases. Genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) enabled the discovery of tens of thousands of loci associated with human traits, but
work remains to decipher underlying biological mechanisms affected by variants in these loci. The long-term
goal of the Project Leader’s research is to identify disease-causal genetic variants and to understand their
mechanistic contribution to pathogenesis. In line with this goal, this project will leverage multi-omics data,
particularly single-cell multi-omics data, to understand the functional impact of genetic variants and use this
information to identify disease-causal variants. The Center of Quantitative Biology will advance the Project
Leader's independent career by providing critical resources and expertise. This includes mentoring by senior
faculty to provide guidance on grant applications, lab management, and identifying key resources. Research
projects in the Project Leader's lab rely heavily on collaboration with the Single-Cell Genomics Core and the
Genomic Data Science Core to conduct sequencing and data analysis. The proposed Research Project will
explore a new framework to study the functional effect of genetic variants using a small cohort of organoids and
use this information to identify causal variants for colon-related diseases. Aim 1 will focus on setting up a genomic
data collection and analysis framework to identify cell-type- and treatment condition-specific genetic effect
variants with potential regulatory roles. We plan to collect single-cell multi-omics data from a cohort of colon
organoids, which contain multiple cell types present in colon tissue. We also plan to collect epigenetic information
of the organoids with and without stimulating treatment. We plan to identify variants with functional effects using
such data and expand the list of functional variants by developing new computational methods. In Aim 2, we will
identify causal variants and genes for colon-related diseases by leveraging functional genomics. We plan to
evaluate the relevance of different cell types for colon diseases by estimating the heritability enrichment in
functional genetic variants identified in different cell types and treatment conditions. Next, they plan to use
functional annotations generated from Aim1 to identify causal genetic variants in GWAS for inflammatory bowel
disease and colorectal cancer. To validate regulatory effects of variants, the team plans to use Perturb-seq,
which targets candidate variants by CRISPRi in conjunction with single-cell RNA sequencing to get cell-level
readout of effect. This study framework will be a fundamental step used by the research team to achieve long-
term goals of understanding the role of common genetic variants in leading to human diseases. In the future, we
plan to collaborate with labs in different disease domains to generate and analyze data using this framework,
and to develop new methodologies to facilitate the translation of genomic data to the knowledge of the genetics
of diseases."
10852732,"PROJECT SUMMARY
T cells play important roles in our immune system by recognizing various antigens, including viruses, through
their diverse T-cell receptors (TCRs). The collective set of TCRs in a person is called the TCR repertoire. One
of the key steps in understanding the TCR repertoire is to identify the binding specificity of each TCR, which
may provide rich insights into the donor’s immune history and potential. However, only a limited number of
antigens and their cognate receptors can be profiled in an experiment for specificity discoveries. In the
research team’s previous works, they demonstrated the ability to extract microbiome and TCR repertoire
information from sequencing data. With these methods, each sample can provide a glimpse of microbiome and
TCR repertoire interactions, suggesting that it is possible to associate the TCRs with their binding targets by
inspecting a large volume of samples. Aim 1 will leverage the resources provided by the CQB cores to
generate essential datasets to investigate how well RNA-seq data can represent the microbiome and TCR
repertoire data. In order to efficiently process vast amounts of raw sequencing data sets, the team will develop
novel computational methods that can significantly reduce the computational overhead. Additionally, they will
extend these methods to work on a broader range of sequencing platforms, such as Oxford Nanopore long-
read data, to incorporate more samples in the study. Aim 2 will apply these methods to obtain the microbiome
and TCR repertoire data from publicly available RNA-seq samples, curate the resources into databases, and
develop computational and statistical tools to annotate the binding specificities of TCRs toward microbiomes.
The tools and resources generated from this project will be disseminated via open-source software and CQB
cores, as well as a user-friendly suite of packages that researchers can use to process RNA-seq samples and
annotate the specificities of TCRs found in their data. The specificity annotation method will enable biologists
to directly identify disease-related TCRs, and leverage the information to track the dynamics of the immune
system or develop TCR-based treatment strategies.
RELEVANCE
T cells can trigger immune reactions upon recognizing various antigens through their diverse TCRs. These
receptors exhibit high specificity to their binding targets and encode valuable health information, such as
bacteria or viral infection history. In this project, we propose an approach to predict the receptor’s binding
specificity by jointly exploring the microbiome and TCR repertoire information from RNA-seq samples. The
TCR specificity annotation procedure will be a valuable method in disease studies to discover crucial TCRs
triggering the immune response, and researchers can utilize the identified TCRs in designing T-cell-based
treatment."
10852734,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
My lab seeks to define the molecular logic of complex cell behaviors— how cells go from sets of interacting
molecules to the emergent properties of living systems. We currently focus on three questions: how
neutrophils control their shape and movement, how lymphocytes detect rare foreign peptides in a sea of self-
peptides, and how mouse embryonic stem cells regulate transcriptional activation. Studying a diversity of cell
types and behaviors makes it easier to identify the general principles of cellular decision-making beyond the
particulars of a given system. And it opens up more interfaces for cross pollination between different projects
in the lab. Transformative science often happens at interfaces, so we seek to borrow tools and concepts from
other fields to address open questions in cell biology and frequently develop new tools when they are needed
to accelerate progress. For instance, optogenetics enables us to plug into defined signaling nodes and test the
logic of subcircuits in a manner that circumvents the feedback, redundancy, and compensation that confound
investigation with standard approaches. Our most common strategy is to pair biosensors for visualizing the
quantitative dynamics of these processes in living cells with precision tools to control the regulators of these
behaviors. For cell migration, we are breaking down the complex process of directed movement into its
fundamental pieces—how a cell decides to initiate a protrusion, how the shape of the protrusion is specified,
how the protrusions compete with one another to enable cell polarity, and how this process is biased by
external gradients. For T cell activation, we are investigating how cells convert small differences in antigen
binding to large changes in cell activation by leveraging a light-responsive T cell antigen. Finally, we are
investigating the logic of transcriptional activation—in particular how enhancers activate promoters and how
transcription factor dynamics specifies the pattern of gene activation."

The mammalian family of RAS small GTPases, composed of HRAS, NRAS, and KRAS, is mutated to remain in
an active, oncogenic state in one fifth of all human cancers. Typically, these mutations occur early, initiating
tumorigenesis. Of the three family members, KRAS is mutated most often, suggesting that some feature of this
gene renders it more likely to initiate tumorigenesis. To this end, our group linked the high frequency with which
KRAS is mutated to a bias of rare codons and resulting poor translation of the encoded mRNA. Mechanistically,
the lower levels of KRAS protein and KRAS/MAPK signaling intensity circumvent the growth arrest response of
senescence, thereby allowing the induction of tumor initiation. Conversely, poor translation of KRAS mRNA is
overcome in later disease stages, promoting tumor progression. Thus, different levels of KRAS/MAPK signaling
intensity dictate distinct phenotypic outputs during cancer initiation and progression. Therefore, there must be
factors that differentially control Ras signaling intensity, and these factors should be critical during either tumor
initiation or tumor progression. Such regulators are of great clinical relevance and could open up the door to a
whole new class of regulators of Ras signaling for therapeutic intervention. My long-term goal is to identify
and therapeutically target “RAS intensity-specific regulators”. To identify these regulators, our group took
advantage of the incredible sensitivity of the Drosophila rough eye phenotype to differential levels of Ras
signaling. We employed the novel approach of altering codon usage in the Ras gene of Drosophila to compare
high and low Ras signaling. We then exploited these two genetic backgrounds to execute the first-ever in vivo
intensity-specific regulator screen and identified fifteen deficiencies. One deficiency was mapped to the
Ribosomal protein S21 (Rps21) gene, which acts as a suppressor of Ras signaling. I therefore plan to investigate
the underlying mechanism by which Rps21 suppresses Ras signaling (Aim 1). In addition, I aim to identify other
novel intensity-specific regulators of Ras signaling in the remaining deficiencies and elucidate their roles in Ras
tumorigenesis in the mammalian setting (Aim 2). Completion of these aims will establish new connections
between translational control and Ras signaling, reveal new genetic vulnerabilities in RAS-driven cancer, and
finally could unearth a pipeline of potential therapeutic targets to explore for cancer therapies."

Prescription opioids are a potent class of drugs for treating pain. However, growing body of research has
described iatrogenic consequences of long-term (> 90 days) opioid use in patients with chronic pain including
hyperalgesia and impaired executive function. Dopamine is a critical modulator of executive function. While
changes in pain and behavior have been noted, little is known about the brain’s morphology, neural and
dopaminergic activity that change over time with long-term prescription opioid use. Consistent with the NIDA
Strategic Plan objective 1.3, this K25 proposal seeks to “establish the effects of drug use, addiction, and recovery
on brain circuits, behavior, and health” using neuroimaging-informed tools. Specifically, the present study
combines multiple levels of investigation, including structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) and neuropsychological
assessments of executive function, and employ machine learning techniques for analysis to identify the effects
of long-term prescription opioid use on the brain in chronic pain patients. The applicant will use her advanced
quantitative skills in neuroimaging data analysis and modeling to training in QST, and experience in
cognitive neuropsychology, epidemiology of chronic pain and addiction to develop an independent research plan
in translational pain and successfully compete for future R01 funding. To achieve the training needed to facilitate
this investigation, the applicant has consulted with an expert in chronic pain research and opioid therapy, a
substance abuse specialist, a neuropsychologist, an epidemiologist, an imaging scientist, and a machine
learning leader in neuroimaging field to develop an innovative study and training plan. 40 patients with a
diagnostically homogeneous chronic pain condition (i.e., chronic low back pain; CLBP) on long-term opioid
therapy, as compared to 40 opioid-naïve CLBP patients, will be studied to achieve the following Aims: 1)
Measure pain, cognitive performance, neural and dopaminergic activity during concurrent pain and executive
function task fMRI-PET to characterize the effects of opioids on pain processing and executive function in CLBP;
2) measure intrinsic brain activity during resting state fMRI-PET to identify intrinsic brain alterations associated
with long-term opioid use in CLBP; and 3) apply high-resolution structural MRI to measure opioid-induced
morphological changes in CLBP. This research is innovative in its use of combined QST and neuro-
psychological measures with multimodal imaging and sophisticated statistical approaches. It is significant
because of its comprehensive approach towards addressing the NIDA Strategic Plan objective. Findings stand
to inform medical decision-making regarding pain care and opioid prescription, as well as risk mitigation
strategies. The research, training and results obtained will provide a platform for applicant’s long-term scientific
research goal of becoming an independent R01-funded, faculty-level principal investigator performing
translational pain research aimed at developing neuroimaging tools to have clinical application."

New prophylactic approaches are needed to prevent acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic
hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Despite prophylaxis with current strategies, 30-70% of recipients still
develop acute GVHD. Development of GVHD is the leading cause of morbidity and non-relapse mortality after
allogeneic HCT, and limits the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients and their ability to return to
activities of daily living. Over the last two decades, our multidisciplinary team has been investigating the use of
histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition (vorinostat) to prevent GVHD. In adult patients, we have completed a
first-in-human phase I/II trial in related donor, reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic HCT (NCT00810602),
and a phase II trial in unrelated donor, myeloablative conditioning allogeneic HCT (NCT01790568), both
indicating safety of vorinostat, possible attenuation of GVHD without compromising the beneficial graft versus
leukemia (GVL) effect, and potential neuroprotective effects (NCT02409134). Pediatric patients undergoing
allogeneic HCT may also benefit from vorinostat to prevent GVHD, but have faced barriers of access to this
potentially life-saving therapy. We have already submitted an application and obtained an IND from the FDA to
conduct a phase I/II trial of vorinostat in addition to standard GVHD prophylaxis for pediatric patients
undergoing unrelated donor myeloablative conditioning HCT. The purpose of this grant is to fund the phase I/II
clinical trial of vorinostat in pediatric HCT. The phase I portion of the study will enroll up to 12 subjects aged 3–
21 years and will determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of vorinostat using a 3+3 up-or-down
algorithm. The single-arm phase II portion of the study will enroll an additional 37 subjects to receive vorinostat
at the RP2D and will determine the incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD at day 100 post-HCT. The objective of
this early phase trial in pediatric HCT is to assess dose, safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and the
RP2D of vorinostat. Important additional endpoints include correlative laboratory studies, cognitive function,
and patient-reported outcomes of HRQOL. We hypothesize that HDAC inhibition with vorinostat regulates the
inflammatory response of GVHD and will correlate with preserved cognition and HRQOL. This study will enroll
pediatric HCT patients for the following reasons: 1) There is a major unmet need of well-designed GVHD
clinical trials in pediatric HCT that integrate clinical outcomes, biological function, cognitive assessments, and
HRQOL measures; 2) Our previous pre-clinical and clinical data of HDAC inhibition for GVHD prevention in
adult HCT provide biological correlates with relevance for mechanism of action; 3) HDAC inhibition may have
neuroprotective properties and preserve HRQOL after allogeneic HCT, a treatment known to negatively impact
cognitive function, particularly in patients receiving unrelated donor grafts, and potentially most significant in
younger aged patients. Thus, this proposal will provide critical information on the safety, tolerability and
preliminary efficacy of vorinostat in pediatric HCT to inform the development of a future, full-scale trial."

Enteric viruses such as human norovirus (HuNoV) and rotavirus (RV) remain the leading causes of acute viral
gastroenteritis, of which there are over 700 million annual cases worldwide. Despite the prevalence of these
enteric pathogens, there are persistent gaps in knowledge in how both viruses disrupt homeostatic
cellular processes to enhance their replication. In addition to sharing clinical manifestations of disease,
members of both Reoviridae and Caliciviridae families are known to dysregulate calcium signaling during the
course of infection through the function of a viral ion channel, or viroporin. RV viroporin-induced calcium
dysregulation has been shown to initiate an ADP-mediated paracrine signaling cascade that ultimately results
in ER calcium release from neighboring uninfected cells, a cellular phenomenon known as intercellular
calcium waves. In addition to proximal cell dysregulation, RV NSP4 viroporin activity initiates a cellular
process known as store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). Preliminary data in the Tulane virus system, a
closely related human norovirus surrogate, has shown both an analogous intercellular calcium signaling
phenotype and the potential to exploit SOCE pathways for enhanced replication. The objective of this
proposal is to characterize the calcium signaling phenotype of Tulane and human norovirus infected cells,
extending these observations to include proximal, uninfected cells, and to determine the role of dysregulated
cellular calcium signaling in viral replication. Aim 1 of this project proposes to characterize aberrant calcium
signaling in infected and proximal, uninfected cells following Tulane and human norovirus infection. Aim 2 will
determine the contributions of store operated calcium entry pathways to virus replication, critically linking
host cell calcium signaling dynamics to viral growth. Unveiling these features of infection will reveal
important parallels in the way that reoviruses and caliciviruses disrupt host cell signaling processes and
may suggest a potentially conserved mechanism of enhanced replication and disease progression in
gut-tropic viruses. Therefore, this proposal will provide critical insight into novel broad-spectrum antiviral
targets."
10847519,"Vascular cells are present throughout the human body and contribute to risk of multiple diseases.
Vascular dysfunction directly affects risk for arterial diseases (e.g. coronary artery disease and stroke) as well
as manifestations of other diseases such as dementia, cancer, and diabetes. Single cell analysis of the human
vasculature has already begun to identify the basic mechanisms of vascular dysfunction in the large number of
associated diseases. Our group, and several other labs, have used single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to
identify vascular cell heterogeneity. We performed scRNA-seq of the aorta to identify functionally distinct
endothelial cell (EC) subpopulations, and multiple groups have identified activated myofibroblasts in diseased
mouse and human vascular tissue. These studies prove heterogenous cell populations exist in the arterial wall,
but it remains undetermined which populations play a causal role in early vascular dysfunction and disease risk.
 The Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) provides a rich source of data to begin to establish
a causal link for specific vascular cell subpopulations with disease. In HuBMAP data, ECs and vascular smooth
muscle cells (VSMCs) comprise a large portion of the single cells identified from each organ. However, to
establish the cell types and transcriptional pathways associated with disease it will be necessary to incorporate
the new datasets and computational methods we propose in this application. We aim to use new computational
methods to integrate data from diseased vascular tissue with normal HuBMAP data, to identify the disease-
relevant features of vascular cells. New methods to integrate disease associated genes from GWAS will also
help investigators prioritize causal cells for multiple common diseases. To achieve this, we will: 1) Use new
software to identify organotypic features of vascular cells in HUBMAP reference data; 2) Identify disease-specific
vascular cell signature by comparing HUBMAP reference data with samples from vascular disease; and 3) Build
and share a computational program to identify disease-relevant cell populations and gene modules through
integration with genetic association data. These analyses make use of existing vascular disease snRNA-seq
data from a rich collection of diseased subjects we can share with the HuBMAP. All data from vascular disease
subjects is available for open data sharing, and has been collected to include a diverse collection of subjects
with respect to sex and ancestry. Our methods and statistical software to perform this integration of multiple
single cell datasets with genetic associations will establish a generalizable methodology to rapidly discover the
disease-relevant cells and processes of the vasculature, and all other cell-types, for any diseases with genetic
risk and available GWAS. Our team is immediately ready to undertake the proposed studies and share the
software with the HuBMAP community. We have a track record of rapidly sharing single cell RNA-seq data, and
have a diverse team with expertise in vascular biology, statistical genetics, and computational biology."

This S10 proposal seeks funds to support the purchase of a state-of-the-art Leica Stellaris 5 confocal
microscope. This new microscope will be an integral part of the Imaging Core Facility within the Department of
Neurobiology and Anatomy at Drexel University College of Medicine. Departmental research is diverse and
spans the areas of development, addiction, neurodegeneration, injury/repair, and computational understanding
of circuits. The various research programs within the Department of Neurobiology and Anatomy rely heavily on
microscopy. Only one aging confocal microscope is operational and available to the multiple NIH-funded users
in the Department. As such, that confocal is now under heavy, daily use that extends into late evenings and
weekends. Because of this heavy usage, the existing confocal microscope has already started to malfunction
and requires frequent technical repairs, delaying progress on many funded projects. Importantly, several of the
users are junior investigators who are at a critical juncture in their biomedical research careers. Acquiring a new
Leica Stellaris 5 will increase the capacity to fulfill the high demand for confocal microscopy needed to advance
and carry NIH-supported research projects forward. In addition, the Stellaris technology is so far advanced
compared to the current confocal that the researchers will be able to achieve significant new heights in their

Power HyD detectors that extend detection into the near infrared spectrum, allowing for greater flexibility in
imaging capacity. This technical advancement and many others will increase productivity on the funded projects
in the Department and will enhance the types of experiments that can be performed, thus improving both the
capacity and capabilities of the health-related neuroscience research."

mTORopathies, such as focal cortical dysplasia type II (FCDII), is the most common underlying pathology in
children with drug-resistant epilepsies. However, the underlying mechanisms of epileptogenesis,
hyperexcitability, and disease progression remain largely elusive. In this proposal, we combine animal models
and resected human tissues to understand the cellular and molecular logic networks in the dysplastic cortex.
We use cutting-edge technologies in molecular genetics, electrophysiology, transgenics, and RNA sequencing
to provide conceptual insights broadly relevant to understanding mTOR-related epilepsies. Our central
hypothesis is that a sustained neurotoxic microenvironment mediated by complement component C3
progressively sculpts cellular and molecular architectures, impair cortical inhibitory circuits, and promote
epileptogenicity in the malformed cortex."

Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. It typically begins in adolescence or
early adulthood, an important developmental period during which higher education, first jobs, and relationships
are pursued. Recurrent mood episodes during this period can have a devastating impact on a young person's
ability to achieve a high quality of life as an adult. A method by which to predict the onset of mood symptoms in
adolescence would create an opportunity to intervene and reduce exposure to the harmful effects of recurrent
episodes. A new approach – digital phenotyping – may make this possible. Digital phenotyping is defined as
the “moment-by-moment quantification of the human phenotype in situ” using data collected from smartphone
sensors (accelerometer, texts, calls, GPS). Digital phenotyping has been used to identify mood changes and
potential signs of relapse in adults with BD, but has not yet been applied to adolescents. We will use Beiwe, a
digital phenotyping application for iOS and Android phones, to collect digital phenotypes from participants
(aged 14-19) over 18-months (N=120; n=70 with BD [I, II, Other Specified], n=50 typically-developing). Over
the follow-up period, participants will complete biweekly mood assessments, and both participants and
caregivers will be interviewed monthly to track changes in mood/behavior. This will allow the phone sensor
data collected with Beiwe to be closely linked to symptom changes. The specific aims of this project are (1) to
characterize the digital phenotype of BD symptoms in adolescents, (2) to describe differences in the digital
phenotypes of the BD and typically developing groups, and (3) to develop a model for predicting mood
symptoms prospectively. The proposed study is consistent with all four NIMH strategic objectives for the future
of mental health research. This K23 Award will provide Anna Van Meter, PhD with the necessary training and
mentorship to (1) gain proficiency in computational psychiatry by learning to analyze longitudinal data using
statistical and machine learning techniques, (2) build expertise in patient-oriented translational research by
designing and conducting a longitudinal study with youth participants; (3) learn to employ state-of-the-art
mobile technology to personalize assessment and intervention using patient data. To accomplish these training
goals, Dr. Van Meter has organized an outstanding mentorship team (Anil Malhotra, MD, Jukka-Pekka Onnela,
DSc, John Kane, MD, Christoph Correll, MD, and Deborah Estrin, PhD), with expertise in patient-oriented
research, technology-based mental health research, computational psychiatry, bipolar disorder in youth, and
computer science. The proposed study will be the first to describe the digital phenotype of BD in adolescents, a
population at great risk for the onset of BD as well as the damaging effects of repeated episodes. The
completion of the proposed K23 Mentored Career Award will support an innovative program of patient-oriented
research, and will provide Dr. Van Meter with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator
pursuing novel technological solutions to improve patients' quality of life."
10852568,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Background: Institutional change in higher education regarding diversity, equity and inclusion, tends to be
complex, contested, and slow moving. However, many institutions continue to design and implement change
programs. Among those are gender equity initiatives that aim to increase the participation and advancement of
diverse women faculty in the science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM)
academic and research workforce. Despite these efforts and initiatives, many institutions continue to face
structural barriers to the change programs they attempt to implement. What is missing is a central hub to
support and advance gender equity programs through collecting, validating, evaluating and disseminating
strategies and outcomes. Such a resource would provide the necessary tools, strategies, and techniques to
optimize gender equity programs collaboratively across STEMM disciplines.
Aims: The proposed National Coordinating Center for Advancing Gender Inclusive Excellence (AGIE) at
Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) intends to fill this gap. In collaboration with the National Institutes of
Health (NIH), the VCU AGIE will create an online central repository for sharing resources, tools, technologies,
expertise, and strategies designed to overcome systemic gender-based inequities impacting the STEMM
academic and research workforce. Stakeholders will be able to search for strategies to identify and address
systemic gender-based inequities and enable women to attain leadership positions in STEMM research. The
aims of the VCU AGIE are to: 1) Evaluate the types and components of programs that substantially increase
the participation and advancement of diverse women faculty in the STEMM academic and research workforce;
2) Develop a central repository for data, tools, programs, and strategies that promote gender equity at the
faculty and leadership levels in the STEMM academic and research workforce; and, 3) Promote and
disseminate research on barriers and strategies to enhance the recruitment, retention and advancement of
STEMM women faculty and leaders in the academic and research workforce.
Impact: The primary outcome of accomplishing these aims will allow the VCU AGIE, in collaboration with the
NIH, to set a national standard of excellence for advancing diverse women in faculty and leadership positions
across the STEMM fields. By accomplishing this goal, this program will create a functional, validated, and
sustainable resource to overcome systemic gender-based inequities impacting the STEMM academic and
research workforce."

This project will digitize and disseminate the only remaining non-digitized U.S. census records between 1790
and the present: the 1960 full-count Census. We will then use the resulting microdata to complete the largest
longitudinal data infrastructure in the U.S. The linked infrastructure currently includes data from the censuses of
1940 and 2000-2020 and will soon include data from the full-count censuses of 1950, 1970, 1980, and 1990,
and the 25% sample from 1960. The current project will incorporate the full-count 1960 Census. These new data
will provide a new mid-life observation for the oldest Americans, including those who lived through the
Depression and World War II, as well as the early-life experiences of their children who are now entering
retirement. When complete, the project will provide the final piece of a massive and powerful multi-purpose
resource that will enable a wide range of new discoveries and applications.
We will undertake four key tasks to accomplish this goal: (1) create a full-count microdata file of the 1960 Census,
(2) capture street address and assign detailed geography, (3) assign linkage keys to facilitate longitudinal
analysis, and (4) document and disseminate the new cross-sectional and longitudinal data.
With our addition of linked cases from 1960, population health researchers will be able to use these data to
analyze the life-course trajectories of hundreds of millions of Americans over the past century. Researchers will
be able to incorporate information on early and mid-life experiences—such as parental economic status,
childhood environmental exposures, public policy, social institutions, neighborhood characteristics, and housing
conditions—into investigations of the health, well-being, and mortality of Americans over their lives and through
generations."

The NEI AMD Pathobiology group concluded that identifying all of the pathogenic signals, prioritizing their
contribution relative to one another, and establishing when these signals are pathogenic will lead to effective
treatment for each AMD stage. Because preventing or curing early AMD will eliminate the burdens of advanced
AMD and reduce its financial burden, this proposal will focus on early AMD. Cellular heterogeneity is a well-
recognized phenomenon. While ordered heterogeneity is protective, stress causes disordered heterogeneity
that induces disease by aggressive subclones, even if comprised of a limited number of cells. Retinal pigment
epithelium (RPE) heterogeneity is well recognized in early AMD, but its pathogenic role is unexplored.
The epigenome mechanistically links environmental exposures with the transcriptome to influence biological
processes, and epigenetic changes vary across individual cells to cause pathogenic cellular heterogeneity.
Smoking, the highest environmental risk factor for AMD, is a powerful epigenetic inducer in part, due to the
altered expression of chromatin modification enzymes that can reprogram the transcriptome to disrupt multiple
cytoprotective pathways, a fundamental characteristic of a complex disease like AMD. Using ATAC-seq and
RNA-seq, we previously linked reduced chromatin accessibility in promoter regions of genes with the RPE
transcriptome in early AMD eyes, implicating the RPE as a driver of early AMD. Furthermore, iPSC-RPE cells
treated with smoke had chromatin accessibility profiles similar to the RPE from early AMD eyes. While
valuable, this global approach does not define RPE heterogeneity or the impact of heterogeneity on RPE
functions related to AMD pathobiology. The objective is to define RPE heterogeneity in early AMD due to
reduced chromatin accessibility from smoking by addressing the hypothesis that pathologic RPE subsets
contribute to early AMD through transcriptome changes induced by epigenetic or genetic alterations. SA1.
Define pathogenic RPE heterogeneity by regional location in aging and early AMD by chromatin accessibility
and transcriptome modifications. ScRNA-seq and scATAC-seq will be used on the RPE from the macula and
periphery from aging and early AMD genotyped globes, and chromatin accessibility and pathologic pathways
from cellular subsets will be visualized by ATAC-see and immunohistochemistry. SA2. Determine the extent
that RPE heterogeneity i) develops due to chromatin accessibility and transcriptional heterogeneity with aging
or smoking, and ii) impacts RPE function in a model of early AMD. ScATAC-seq and scRNA-seq will be used
to assess chromatin accessibility and transcriptional RPE heterogeneity in wild-type (littermates), HDAC11-/-,
and WT mice treated with HDAC11 inhibitor Mocetinostat exposed to chronic cigarette smoke. The spatial
distribution of RPE heterogeneity will be identified using immunofluorescence of biomarkers of cellular subsets
and ATAC-see and impact on RPE function will be assessed."

The functions and computations supported by changes in the activity of meso-striatal dopamine systems are
some of the most heavily researched, and hotly debated, topics in modern neuroscience. Predominant theories
propose that they support reinforcement learning by broadcasting prediction-error signals, encode stimulus
salience, or generally motivate reward seeking by representing internal states. Furthermore, it is widely accepted
that these systems have been shaped by natural selection to reinforce adaptive behaviors. Eating, or the pursuit
of nutrients, is fundamental for survival, and previous work has demonstrated that striatal DA circuits are critical
components of the neurobiological systems that support this behavior. Importantly, emerging research supports
a model whereby midbrain DA populations receive signals from the gut about food content that modify their
activity and contribute to food learning and motivation. However, the timescale over which these gut-derived
signals modulate DA release, and how they interact with DA signals previously identified as critical for food
reward learning and motivation, is largely unknown. Here, we propose to address these gaps in our knowledge
by using state of the art techniques to 1) Identify the ensembles of neurons in midbrain dopamine populations
that are recruited by post-ingestive signals to control food reward. 2) Characterize the ability of post-ingestive
signals to modify reward learning via effects on dopamine release in subregions of the striatum. 3)Test the causal
role of post-ingestive signals for dopamine control of food reward. To accomplish these aims, we have
assembled a team including behavioral and systems neuroscientists with expertise in modern technologies for
recording and manipulating genetically defined cell populations, translational neuroscientists with expertise in
the neurobiology of appetitive behaviors, statisticians specializing in big-data analysis, as well as leaders in the
field of computational neuroscience. Completion of these studies will provide an opportunity to integrate
peripheral modulation of midbrain dopamine systems into current models of dopamine control of reward learning
and motivation, and provide a foundation for future studies of peripheral-central dopamine contributions to
multiple adaptive functions and disease states."

The goals of my research since 1978 have been to distinguish the features of cancer cells from
healthy cells in order to be able to discover and develop safe and selective, innovative
immunotherapies. Here, we leverage my past body of work that has evolved from native mouse
antibodies, to humanized mAb, to various potent conjugates of these mAb, to TCRm antibodies,
and ultimately to BiTE forms and CAR forms to create the latest generation of agents and
experiments now proposed. This scientific progression has been sustained for more than 3
decades. This work is innovative, as noted by our numerous therapeutic firsts and more than 3
dozen patents, including: human antibodies for the treatment of acute leukemia, targeted alpha-
particle therapies, in vivo alpha-particle isotope generators, oncogenic fusion point vaccines,
human TCR mimic antibodies to intracellular oncogenic proteins, and most recently, various
innovative CAR technologies, now in progress. Several of the antibodies and vaccines reached
late stage, national clinical trials such as a WT1 vaccine, Galenpepimut, and our alpha
generator-Lintuzumab. But now, how do we achieve true cancer specificity? The immune
system has evolved the T cell and TCR as a highly efficient and truly selective system capable
of recognizing viral and mutated intracellular proteins derived from inside the cell. Therefore, in
this OIA the questions are: Is it possible to make truly cancer selective monoclonal antibodies,
and various derived molecular platforms, that will be effective therapeutically by mimicking a
TCR? What are the obstacles and cancer resistance mechanisms to this approach and how will
they be overcome? How do we select the right target epitopes and also avoid inevitable off-
targets that may cause toxicity? The following issues will be addressed: A. Target choices: What
are the best epitopes from a biochemical, biophysical, or immunological point of view? Are
certain classes of proteins or structures of peptides preferred? How do we design screens for
TCRm? B. Can we modulate the expression of the epitopes or the antigen presentation
machinery? How is the MHC ligandome generally affected by these drugs and is this important?
C. Predictive tools: Can we develop proteomic and genetic tools to create general rules and to
help guide us to picking epitopes and predicting which may be safe? D. What cancer
therapeutic platform for the TCRm makes the most sense in light of what we have learned about
the biology and immunology of the epitope, as well as the predictions of specificity from the tool
sets?"
10854843,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The long-term goal of this K08 career development proposal is to advance my training in perinatal health
services research with the goal of improving the health of substance-exposed, maternal-infant dyads.
My new skills and experiences will be in 1) management of complex datasets; 2) multilevel and
triangulation analytics; 3) implementation strategy design and testing; and 4) leadership for policy
engagement and impact. The aims of the research proposal seek to improve outcomes of opioid-
exposed infants by improving breastfeeding and skin-to-skin care practices. Nonpharmacologic
approaches are considered primary treatment for opioid-exposed infants. However, many opioid-using women
eligible to breastfeed do not and less than 50% of those who start, stop within six days postpartum. Opioid-
exposed infants are vulnerable to withdrawal symptoms, resulting in longer lengths of hospitalization, exposure
to pharmacologic treatment, and increased hospital costs. It is well-recognized that breastfeeding and skin-to-
skin care can reduce severity and number of neonatal withdrawal symptoms, improve maternal-infant bonding
as well as decrease lengths of stay and reduce costs. Despite these benefits, breastfeeding and skin-to-skin
rates remain remarkably low and it is unclear why they have not been broadly implemented. It may be because
most implementation efforts have focused on clinician activities (e.g., assessment, diagnosis, pharmacologic
treatment) and not on mothers and their care for their newborns. Toward the goal of better understanding the
structural and personal barriers to breastfeeding and skin-to-skin as treatment for opioid-exposed infants, the
proposed 5-year study will examine factors affecting breastfeeding and skin-to-skin practices using a mixed
methods design. Four hospitals have been recruited for collection of medical record data from linked maternal-
infant dyads (N=360), survey data from clinicians (N=513 anticipated) to describe and explore relevant
implementation factors, and longitudinal semi-structured interview data from opioid-exposed mothers (N=30).
Aim 1 scrutinizes the effects of maternal, neonatal, and unit context factors on breastfeeding and skin-to-skin
care to treat opioid-exposed infants using method triangulation and multilevel analytics. Aim 2 detects and
interrogates the implementation facilitators, barriers, and strategies relevant to implementation of maternal-
delivered care using semi-structured interviews with mothers, data triangulation and theory-informed
implementation mapping. Aim 3 conducts a pilot implementation strategy and evaluates implementation and care
delivery outcomes. Completion of these aims provides the requisite training and data for an R01 proposal. This
proposal is synergistic and uniquely complimentary with NICHD’s current investment in addressing neonatal
opioid withdrawal. Formal training is planned under the mentorship of Dr. Vanessa Dalton and co-mentors with
relevant methodologic and content expertise. Training will complement my expertise in implementation science,
address training gaps, and contribute to the success and public health impact of the proposed research."

Chronic cocaine abuse is associated with long-lasting impairments in impulse control and decision-making that
increase the risk for relapse. However, the brain circuits fundamentally involved in impulsive behavior and their
alteration by chronic drug use are not well understood. Accumulating evidence in humans and animals implicates
nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs), yet given their wide expression in different neuronal
populations, it remains unclear which D2Rs play a key role in impulsive behavior. In particular, the contributions
of D2Rs in cholinergic interneurons (CINs), which constitute only 2-3% of neurons in the NAc, have been largely
overlooked, despite known CIN contributions to NAc function and cocaine reinforcement. To fill this gap in our
knowledge, it is urgent to elucidate the consequences of D2R alterations in CINs on impulsive behavior with
greater cell-type specificity. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the cellular and circuit mechanisms by which NAc
CINs regulate impulsive behavior, which may uncover potential therapeutic strategies for reducing cocaine re-
lapse. The overall objective of this application is to use cell-selective strategies to: 1) determine whether and
how CIN D2Rs mediate impulsive behavior, and 2) whether CIN D2Rs participate in cocaine-induced augmen-
tation of impulsivity. Our central hypothesis is that CIN D2Rs mediate impulsive behaviors by altering NAc ace-
tylcholine (ACh) release following predictive cues, and that chronic cocaine causes excessive impulsivity via CIN
D2Rs. Aim 1 will use cell type-specific genetic approaches in mice to bidirectionally alter D2R expression in CINs
to test the impact on a delay discounting task, which assesses preference for small, short-term rewards over
larger, delayed rewards. Using in vivo fiber photometry combined with optogenetics, Aim 2 will determine ACh
dynamics in delay discounting and test whether the ACh pause in response to cues modulates impulsive choice.
Aim 3 will determine whether CIN D2Rs and the CIN pause mediate the increase in impulsive choice resulting
from chronic cocaine exposure. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it uses targeted
approaches in behaving mice to examine a previously unrecognized role for the NAc CIN and its D2Rs in impul-
sivity. Successful completion of the proposed aims will thus generate a novel dissection of neuronal mechanisms
at play in impulsive choice, both under normal conditions and following repeated cocaine exposure. Such infor-
mation is urgently needed for developing new treatments to counter drug-induced alterations in brain function
that contribute to relapse."

Heart disease is the leading cause of death for Alaska Native men and the second leading cause of death
(after cancer) among women and Alaska Native people overall. The overarching goal of the proposed
multilevel, multicomponent intervention, Diet and Active Lifestyle - Yuuyaraq (DAiLY), is to reduce
consumption of highly processed store-bought foods while promoting intake of subsistence foods, healthy
store-bought foods, and a more active lifestyle to reduce heart disease risk. The Yup'ik word Yuuyaraq means
`the Yup'ik way of life' and encompasses a worldview in which living in harmony with the environment, as well
as sharing of subsistence foods and traditional knowledge is central. The proposed DAiLY intervention is
grounded in the Yup'ik worldview and Indigenous Food Sovereignty, and supported by a foundation of trust
resulting from 22 years of continuous Community Based Participatory Research on heart disease risk and
protective factors with Yup'ik communities. DAiLY is a direct response to the intervention research requests of
community partners and input from Yup'ik Community Research Associates and a Yup'ik Community Planning
Group during the formative research and community engagement process shaping this proposal. The
proposed intervention, based on the Warnecke model of health disparities and social cognitive theory, includes
three components: 1) home-based workshops, framed in the Yupik worldview, led by Community Research
Associates to facilitate interactive discussions with community members about healthy market foods, as well
as the health benefits of locally harvested traditional foods and increased physical activity; 2) local food store
interventions to increase access to, and help build demand for, healthy food options; and 3) traditional
community activities, including Yuraq (Yup'ik traditional dance), Native sports events, and berry festivals, that
provide opportunities to increase physical activity. The three components will be supported and reinforced via
community media, including Facebook, text messaging and visual materials. A continuous metabolic
syndrome score will be used as the primary outcome to assess changes in heart disease risk, and objective
stable isotope biomarkers of diet and a validated food frequency questionnaire will be used to measure intake
of traditional and market foods. We will test the DAiLY intervention in four Yupik communities, randomized to
immediate and delayed intervention. Aim 1, will determine the effectiveness of the DAiLY intervention on heart
disease risk by measuring change in a continuous metabolic syndrome risk score (primary outcome). Aim 2,
will assess implementation of the DAiLY intervention using a mixed methods process evaluation to determine
fidelity, dose, and reach, as well as barriers and facilitators to implementation of program activities and
participant satisfaction and engagement. Aim 3, will determine the impact of the DAiLY intervention on
community-level outcomes, including access to, and sales of, healthy foods in local stores, as well as
opportunities for physical activity at community venues."

Natural products offer a rich and plentiful source of novel compounds with biological activities from which fresh
inspiration can be drawn for the discovery and design of new pharmaceuticals. Moreover, the rapid pace at which
bioinformatic and genomic technologies are developing has led to a wealth of untested leads and intriguing
questions regarding the biosynthetic pathways for these compounds. Enzymes utilizing radical intermediates are
featured prominently here catalyzing chemical transformations that would otherwise not be possible under
physiological conditions. Consequently, secondary metabolism is characterized by a multitude of unusual
chemical structures rarely observed in primary metabolism. However, the instability of free radicals can easily
lead such enzymatic reactions to go awry due to even minor perturbations. Not only does this suggest a
mechanism for the evolution and diversification of radical-mediated transformations as proposed for radical SAM
(S-adenosyl-L-methionine) enzymes but also implies that these enzymes may be engineered to catalyze similarly
challenging transformations with applications in synthetic biology. In the spirit of helping to realize this potential,
we have identified two primary areas of investigation with additional exploratory worked planned as well. The
first direction involves study of the homologous pair of dehydratase and dehydrogenase twitch radical SAM
enzymes BlsE and HikC, which respectively participate in the biosynthesis of the fungicide blasticidin S and
antihelminthic agent hikizimycin. Given their evolutionary relationship, we hope to tease apart their catalytic
properties in a comparative manner in order to understand how the fates of their radical intermediates are
channeled to effect two distinctly different catalytic outcomes. The second direction focuses on biosynthesis of
the antiviral nucleosides oxetanocin A and albucidin. Where one would normally expect a ribose, these natural
products instead possess a four-membered oxetane ring that is constructed via radical-mediated transformations
catalyzed by B12-dependent radical SAM enzymes. This chemistry is thus unique among the cobalamin-
dependent radical SAM enzymes, which are primarily known to function as methyltransferases. These two
projects are not only designed to offer new insights into the mechanisms of secondary metabolic enzymes that
utilize radical intermediates but also to open new avenues of study. Nevertheless, a third component of the
proposal is specifically designed to probe high risk systems including biosynthesis of the cis-fused cyclobutane
ring system of ladderanes; a non-heme iron enzyme with a unique quadruple-histidyl/carboxylysyl coordination
sphere newly discovered in the biosynthesis of oxazinomycin; as well as a radical SAM enzyme that catalyzes
an unusual sulfur-for-oxygen bridge swapping reaction during biosynthesis of the Trojan horse antibiotic
albomycin. Collectively our efforts are intended to provide a solid and principled foundation on which chemical
biologists and biotechnologists can ground their own research and discovery efforts for the betterment of human
health and wellbeing."

fund 26 pilot and feasibility (P&F) studies, most of which were granted to junior investigators or established
investigators pursuing novel research directions in the biology of aging or investigators who are new to aging.
Of these, more than 50% of awardees demonstrated clear outcomes of success indicated by the acquisition of
funds and/or submission of manuscripts and new grant applications. Given this success, we intend to continue
with our objective to maintain P&F funding as part of the RDC deliverables. These P&F studies are designed to
and will continue to enhance and support E-NSC science at Einstein and at member institutions. The P&F funds
will be preferentially distributed to meritorious junior or ‘new to aging’ investigators. A second major objective of
the E-NSC has been to identify new faculty who have the potential to transition to aging research and to provide
continuous mentoring to them through multiple portals including the grant application process. To that end, we
have had much success in that we have attracted and advised junior researchers who have applied for and
successfully obtained funding from the NIH/NIA. Additionally, several newly recruited faculty to Einstein have
shifted their primary focus to the basic biology of aging. We will continue to draw on established senior
investigators at Einstein to mentor and support researchers in their preparation of P&F applications and new
P&F awardees. The third objective of the RDC will be to communicate its important opportunities and available
resources, which includes P&Fs, core services and mentoring to trainees and established investigators. This will
occur through various platforms such as the Biology of Aging course, via invited talks and seminars, and through
interactive community events such as the Einstein Hackathon and the annual E-NSC mini-retreats. We believe
that RDC activities strengthen the E-NSC community active in aging research, attract new investigators to aging-
related research, and successfully promote new research endeavors in aging-related areas. Aging is considered
a key priority for the leadership at Einstein as shown by the Institutional commitment to match budgeted P&F
funds, yielding up to $300,000 annually in total available funds for P&F grants. This will permit the funding of at
least 7-12 P&F projects in any given year. Consequently, in the next funding period, we will continue to drive the
programs that have been successful and introduce new programs with the primary objective of raising awareness
about the omnipresence of the aging process in all aspects of biology."

10844339,"Background: Major health care transformations within and outside of VA are now providing Veterans with
unprecedented health care choices. Within VA, under recent federal legislation integrated networks of
community providers and public reporting of access and quality at VA facilities are aiming to expand health
care choices for Veterans and improve the timeliness of services. Outside of VA, many lower-income Veterans
in states that expanded Medicaid now have a public insurance option, while privately-insured Veterans are
increasingly facing high deductibles in their health plans.
Significance/Impact: Major shifts in health care financing and delivery present Veterans with opportunities to
make decisions about their use of VA and non-VA health care that optimize the timeliness, affordability, quality,
and patient-centeredness of their care. However, these decisions also carry great potential for unintended
consequences if they are not well-informed. Despite such high stakes, little is known about how Veterans are
making decisions about using VA and non-VA care, what information they want to use in this decision-making,
and how provision of information to Veterans about their health care options could be improved. Understanding
these issues is critical to the success of national efforts to expand health care choices for Veterans under the
VA MISSION Act and to achieve a VA health care system that is maximally responsive to Veterans’ needs.
Innovation: This study is the first to assess the views, experiences, and information needs of Veterans who
are users and non-users of VA health care.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Examine how Veterans are making decisions about VA and non-VA care and what
information they want to use when making these decisions. Aim 2: Identify correlates of Veterans’ decisions to
use and experiences with using VA and non-VA health care. Aim 3: Engage Veterans and VA leaders to
identify opportunities to optimize Veterans’ decisions about use of VA and non-VA care and VA’s
responsiveness to Veterans’ health care preferences.
Methodology: We will partner with Veterans organizations to conduct focus groups and semi-structured
interviews that will examine decision-making experiences of Veterans who use VA care, non-VA care, or both;
the sources of information Veterans have used and would want to use in this decision-making; and Veterans’
experiences with the timeliness, affordability, quality, and patient-centeredness of VA and non-VA care. We will
use these findings to develop and field a national survey of Veterans’ use of and decision-making about VA
and non-VA care; factors related to their decision-making and health needs; and perceptions of the timeliness,
affordability, quality, and patient-centeredness of their health care. The nationally representative sample of
3,000 Veterans will include both users and non-users of VA health care. We will identify Veteran characteristics
associated with use of VA and non-VA health care services and with their health care experiences in VA and
community health care settings. Finally, we will conduct deliberative forums with Veterans and VA operational
leaders to develop actionable strategies that can be used to support Veterans’ decisions about VA and non-VA
health care. Using a combination of deliberation and design methods, we will share key findings from the first 2
Aims and then guide participants through a collaborative process in which they will identify and prioritize
programs and policies that could support Veteran decision-making about use of VA and non-VA care.
Next Steps/Implementation: Products will include a compendium of the types of information Veterans use
and need for decision-making about VA and non-VA care, new survey measures to assess Veterans’ decisions
about VA and non-VA care, and a prioritized list of programs and policies that could be implemented to help
Veterans make decisions about VA and non-VA care. We will use these products to work with our VA and non-
VA partners to develop new strategies to optimize Veteran decision-making about VA and non-VA care."

and how provision of information to Veterans about their health care options could be improved. Understanding
these issues is critical to the success of national efforts to expand health care choices for Veterans under the
VA MISSION Act and to achieve a VA health care system that is maximally responsive to Veterans’ needs.
Innovation: This study is the first to assess the views, experiences, and information needs of Veterans who
are users and non-users of VA health care.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Examine how Veterans are making decisions about VA and non-VA care and what
information they want to use when making these decisions. Aim 2: Identify correlates of Veterans’ decisions to
use and experiences with using VA and non-VA health care. Aim 3: Engage Veterans and VA leaders to
identify opportunities to optimize Veterans’ decisions about use of VA and non-VA care and VA’s
responsiveness to Veterans’ health care preferences.
Methodology: We will partner with Veterans organizations to conduct focus groups and semi-structured
interviews that will examine decision-making experiences of Veterans who use VA care, non-VA care, or both;
the sources of information Veterans have used and would want to use in this decision-making; and Veterans’
experiences with the timeliness, affordability, quality, and patient-centeredness of VA and non-VA care. We will
use these findings to develop and field a national survey of Veterans’ use of and decision-making about VA
and non-VA care; factors related to their decision-making and health needs; and perceptions of the timeliness,
affordability, quality, and patient-centeredness of their health care. The nationally representative sample of
3,000 Veterans will include both users and non-users of VA health care. We will identify Veteran characteristics
associated with use of VA and non-VA health care services and with their health care experiences in VA and
community health care settings. Finally, we will conduct deliberative forums with Veterans and VA operational
leaders to develop actionable strategies that can be used to support Veterans’ decisions about VA and non-VA
health care. Using a combination of deliberation and design methods, we will share key findings from the first 2
Aims and then guide participants through a collaborative process in which they will identify and prioritize
programs and policies that could support Veteran decision-making about use of VA and non-VA care.
Next Steps/Implementation: Products will include a compendium of the types of information Veterans use
and need for decision-making about VA and non-VA care, new survey measures to assess Veterans’ decisions
about VA and non-VA care, and a prioritized list of programs and policies that could be implemented to help
Veterans make decisions about VA and non-VA care. We will use these products to work with our VA and non-
VA partners to develop new strategies to optimize Veteran decision-making about VA and non-VA care."
10953533,"Background: Improving access to high-quality care is a top priority for VHA. However, access is difficult to
measure, especially in the ever-changing U.S. health care landscape. VHA currently focuses on perceived
satisfaction measured from survey questions, or wait times measured with administrative data. The wait time
metric has received considerable focus in both the Choice and MISSION Acts, yet experts recognize that wait
times are imperfect; they are not only challenging to interpret, but they are rarely available from community
providers, hindering any VHA to non-VA comparisons. VHA leaders tasked with implementing the Choice and
MISSION Acts desire better evidence-based access measures so they can evaluate their program’s impact.
Our inability to measure access threatens the future of VHA as a health care provider. Without new metrics
that track gaps or improvements in access, VHA is likely to invest in the wrong initiatives, fueling critics who will
argue that privatization will fix the programs Significance/Impact: Our objective is to develop new measures
of access. These new measures will provide causal information on gaps in VHA services, while also showing
the potential impact that expanded access would have on Veterans’ health. Our study leverages natural
experiments in the form of arbitrary administrative rules that enable Veterans to access care outside VHA in
the forms of Medicare and VA Community Care (VACC). Veterans close to the rule thresholds are similar, yet
some gain access based on the rule, while the others do not. We can leverage this information to understand
how this added access changes health care utilization and health outcomes. Our results will be useful to
national and local VHA leaders as they grapple with how to best improve access with a limited budget.
Innovation: It is not feasible to perform a large-scale randomized clinical trial to find the effect of access on
utilization and health outcomes. Correlational studies will miss important confounders, and as everyone knows
correlation does not equal causation, which is what VHA leaders need most. Instead, we apply novel
econometric techniques to take advantage of natural experiments and find the causal effects of increasing
access. The results from this approach can then be used as a measure of access for both VHA and non-VA
care. This is directly aligned with HSR&D's priorities on access to care, research related to the MISSION Act,
and advancing health services research methods across conditions or care settings. Specific Aims: Aim 1:
Find the causal impact of Medicare eligibility on Veteran utilization and health, and identify procedures and
diagnosis groups that are most affected. Aim 2: Find the causal impact of VACC on Veteran utilization and
health, and find the procedures and diagnoses most affected. Aim 3: Identify subgroup analyses that would
give crucial information to VHA leaders. Methodology: In Aims 1 and 2, we will apply an econometric
technique called regression discontinuity design. We will gather a near complete census of VHA and non-VA
records for all recent Veteran VHA users, allowing for precise claims-based measures of utilization, health, and
mortality. In Aim 1, this approach leverages the sharp change in Medicare eligibility that occurs at age 65 to
find the effect of Medicare on utilization and health. Aim 2 uses the same approach, but instead of age 65, we
use the driving distance rules to find the effect of VA Community Care on utilization and health. For these aims
we will examine both overall effects and procedure and diagnosis specific effects. In Aim 3, we take a
combined approach of working with operational partners and applying machine learning techniques for
heterogenous treatment effects to identify and examine metrics and measures that can be used for policy
formation. Next Steps and Implementation: By working with operational partners through Aim 3, we will
identify opportunities and barriers to implementing measures and metrics derived from our results. This
information will be key to setting policy related to VHA’s evolution into a provider and payer of Veteran care
while ensuring that Veterans receive high-quality care in both VHA and non-VA settings."
10823650,"Project Summary
Research: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an advanced technology that is increasingly used
to sustain life for some of the sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). This form of life support has
potential to serve as a crucial bridge to recovery or durable treatment for many patients with cardiac or
pulmonary failure, but mortality exceeds 50%, and some patients remain dependent on ECMO for weeks to
months without a clear path toward liberation from life support. Because some forms of ECMO can sustain life
nearly indefinitely, death is frequently in the context of complex decisions to withdraw ECMO support. Family
members of patients on ECMO play a key role as surrogate-decision maker in these challenging decisions and
have been found to experience high levels of psychological distress associated with their loved one’s illness.
The high illness severity of patients supported by ECMO, the unique ability of ECMO to sustain life for
extended periods of time even when prognosis is extremely poor, and the increased psychological distress
among family members of patients on ECMO suggest that there may be a role for increased palliative care
support for these patients and their families. Palliative care is often offered by a specialty palliative care
consulting service that can support patients and families in determining goals of care, help align treatments
towards goal-concordant care, and address psychosocial distress, all of which are pertinent issues for patients
supported with ECMO and their families. With widespread adoption of ECMO occurring only recently, there has
been little research into the palliative care needs of this population. The objective of this project is to define
current use of specialty palliative care for patients on ECMO and their families (Aim 1), and to use a qualitative
approach to explore palliative care needs among this population (Aim 2). Accomplishing these two aims will
expose unmet needs of patients on ECMO and their families, which will in turn be the target for future palliative
care and supportive intervention trials. Identification of these needs and development of interventions designed
to address them are key steps in improving the quality of ECMO-related care.
Candidate and Environment: With the support of Dr. Erin Kross, Dr. Claire Creutzfeldt, Dr. Daniel Brodie,
biostatistician Dr. Lyndia Brumback, and qualitative expert Dr. Danae Dotolo, Dr. Kiker is establishing herself
as a promising and enthusiastic physician-scientist. The proposed research will be instrumental in her research
training from both content and methodological perspectives. Results from these studies will determine future
targets for palliative care-based interventions to support patients on ECMO and their families and improve the
quality of ECMO-related care. Skills gained in statistical analysis and qualitative methodology will facilitate
success as she applies for a career development award, and later for independent investigator awards."
10823655,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The proposed research will improve the understanding of structure-property-function
relationships in formulations of charge-altering releasable transporter (CART) gene delivery vectors.
These materials demonstrate remarkable efficiency for mRNA transfection with low cytotoxicity due
to charge-neutralizing degradative chemistry and have shown remarkable selectivity towards
different organs in vivo depending on the chemical structure of the CART. A predictive understanding
of how chemical variation affects nanostructure and biological activity will be established. If
successful, a set of design rules for CARTs will guide the optimization of mRNA/CART complexes
for improved cellular transfection and catered cellular/organ selectivity enabling the development of
site-specific CART / RNA therapeutics.
 The fellow will be the first to perform detailed structural and dynamic studies using advanced
cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryoEM) and in situ X-ray scattering, illuminating the
morphological properties of mRNA/CART nanoparticles. Additionally, this proposal will establish if
nanostructure variation arises from changes in formulation technique and CART chemical structures
(cation, lipid) and relate these nano-structural variation to differences in biological function. The
fellow will develop microfluidic mixing protocols (t-mixer) and screen mRNA/CARTs with differing
sizes/morphologies in vitro with cell cultures to establish correlations between functional outcome
and nanostructure. In addition to cryoEM and scattering, supplementary measurements of zeta
potential, size, phase, thermal transitions, supramolecular interactions, etc. will be carried out to
determine the effect physico-chemical properties has on nanostructure in different CART
formulations. In separate future research not covered by this proposal, the most distinct
mRNA/CARTs will be further studied with in vivo experimentation in mouse models with our
collaborators. The fellow will also receive formal and informal training in the responsible conduct of
research, teaching, career development skills applicable to their future career goals of becoming a
research professor and participate in outreach and mentoring. These studies will take place in a
highly interdisciplinary training environment at Stanford University in the lab of Prof. Robert
Waymouth, in close collaboration with Dr. Christopher Tassone at SSRL (SLAC national laboratory)."
10922737,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Auditory-guided behaviors occur whenever auditory information is used to drive our decisions and actions. The
auditory cortex (ACtx) sits at the apex of the ascending auditory pathway but transforming acoustic features into
a behavioral outcome necessitates communication with regions outside of this auditory hierarchy. The primary
routes for ACtx to propagate auditory information throughout the brain are through intratelencephalic (IT) and
extratelencephalic (ET) neurons in cortical layer (L) 5, which are classified based on their distinct and largely
non-overlapping projection targets. However, little is known about the functional differences of these distinct
excitatory populations within ACtx. Investigating the neural circuitry underlying auditory-guided behavior and how
auditory information is used to drive behavior would fill a significant gap in our knowledge. A ubiquitous auditory-
guided behavior is categorization: the transformation of acoustic features into discrete perceptual categories that
drive a subsequent behavioral outcome. To investigate the role of L5 IT and ET neurons in such a behavior, we
designed a novel auditory categorization task for mice and performed two-photon imaging across days of
learning. Our preliminary data shows that L5 IT and ET neurons exhibit a divergence in their representation of
stimulus category and behavioral choice that is sculpted across learning. This suggests that IT projections are
important in initial stages of learning while ET projections are recruited and strengthened throughout learning.
Aim 1 will determine the contributions of L5 IT and ET neurons to learning an auditory categorization task and
Aim 2 will examine if these neurons differentially encode behavioral choice across learning. Combined, these
two Specific Aims will provide initial insight as to how two distinct excitatory cell-types in the largest cortical output
layer contribute to auditory-guided behavior. The outcomes of these experiments will expand our understanding
of how sensory information is propagated throughout the brain and how cortical circuits enable complex
behaviors. Furthermore, this proposal will considerably enhance my personal and professional development as
an independent scientist. Successful completion of this proposal will prepare me for my long-term goal of
becoming a principal investigator in auditory neuroscience."
10849139,"Multiple-X-ray Source Array-based Computed Tomography (MXA-CT)
The long-term objectives of the proposed research are to develop an x-ray tube which contains an array of 6 x-
ray sources within the same vacuum enclosure, and then demonstrate the utility of this multiple x -ray source
array (MXA) towards improving image quality in whole body (general-purpose) computed tomography (CT)
scanners as well as cone beam CT systems. Current CT systems with a single x-ray source which have large
coverage along the length of the patient (the z-axis) suffer from considerable cone beam artifacts at the
peripheral edges of the field-of-view, due to incomplete sampling caused by angled x-ray trajectories imposed
by the geometry of a single x-ray source system. By aligning six x-ray sources along the z-axis and pulsing them
wisely during the CT scan, the angled x-ray trajectories which cause cone beam artifacts can be significantly
reduced, essentially eliminating these cone beam artifacts. The specific aims include (1) design, fabrication and
testing of the six-source x-ray tube, (2) design and construction of a test bed tabletop CT scanner which will use
the MXA source to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scanner system as a proof -of-
principle, (3) work in collaboration with one of the largest manufacturers of x-ray tubes in the world (Varex) to
gain from their x-ray tube (and detector) experience and demonstrate with them the scientific and technical
potential of this new x-ray tube design in a way that facilitates commercialization of the MXA-CT technology, (4)
development of CT image reconstruction algorithms (including conventional and AI-based) which are specifically
tailored to the unique geometry of the proposed tabletop CT prototype, (5) perform Monte Carlo and other
computer simulations to thoroughly evaluate the radiation dose distribution produced by this new sca nner
geometry, and (6) use phantom and cadaver imaging experiments on the prototype MXA-CT system to
demonstrate superior CT imaging performance using rigorous quantitative metrics of image quality and artifact
reduction.
This proposal is submitted under the Bioengineering Partnerships with Industry (BPI, PAR-22-123), and
represents a collaboration between University of California Davis, Johns Hopkins University, University of New
Mexico Albuquerque, and Varex Imaging as our corporate partner. Along with t hree engaged consultants, the
research team possesses depth and breadth with respect to CT imaging and technology development, along

10832510,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
This project on the Demography of Chronic Pain will use demographic data, methods, and theories to
comprehensively investigate high-priority questions about chronic pain's prevalence, distribution, long-term
trends, precursors, and consequences. The project's long-term goal is to enhance U.S. public health by greatly
expanding the scientific knowledge base regarding patterns and trends in chronic pain, pain's links to disability
and mortality, and individual and population-level factors that could reduce the burden of pain.
Through quantitative analyses of large, longitudinal or repeated cross-sectional datasets (primarily American,
but also Canadian and European for comparative purposes), this research will advance four specific aims:
 • Aim 1: To identify national and regional trends in the prevalence and social distribution of chronic pain.
 • Aim 2: To identify individual-level and contextual factors shaping temporal and social patterns in pain.
 • Aim 3: To theoretically and empirically integrate chronic pain into models of disability.
 • Aim 4: To investigate the association between chronic pain and mortality.
This research is significant and timely because chronic pain is one of the country's most common, costly, and
disabling health problems, with a strikingly unequal social distribution. Chronic pain is also implicated in many of
the most troubling contemporary U.S. health trends, including the opioid epidemic, rising suicide rates, increasing
mid-life disability and mortality, and growing educational inequalities in health and mortality. Pain is thus both a
major problem in its own right, and a potential missing link in recent adverse trends in U.S. population health
more broadly.
This research is innovative because the field of demography has nearly completely neglected the topic of chronic
pain, even though pain is a (perhaps the) leading cause of disability, a powerful predictor of mortality, and a
major contributor to social disparities in health. Little is known about long-term trends in pain or pain disparities,
cross-national differences in such trends, individual or contextual (regional or national) factors shaping such
trends, the role of pain in development of disability, or pain's contributions to mortality patterns.
This project will establish a new subfield within the demography of health and aging that investigates these
topics. Findings will clarify how health policies and practices can best prevent and address chronic pain, support
healthy aging, and enhance overall U.S. population health."

The objective of the Stanford Cardiovascular Summer Research Training Program for Medical Students is to
provide meaningful ten-week summer research experiences to a diverse cohort of 15 first-year medical students
from across the country in the field of cardiovascular science. Our long-term goal is to bolster the pool of
physician-scientists in our workforce by 1) increasing their diversity, 2) exposing them to the landscape of 21st
century translational medicine, and 3) providing them with a strong foundation in rigor, reproducibility and the
responsible conduct of research. We will work toward the first goal by partnering directly with Meharry Medical
College (co-PI Dr. Stephanie McClure) and the University of Puerto Rico (co-PI Dr. América Facundo) to
provide a dedicated track for underrepresented minority (URM) medical students from their institutions to obtain
research experiences with Stanford faculty. 40-60% of our placements will be dedicated to medical students
from underrepresented backgrounds. After recruiting a diverse pool of medical students, we will provide our
trainees with a comprehensive ten-week curriculum that will prepare them for careers as physician-scientists in
cardiovascular medicine. 80% of trainee time will be devoted to a cardiovascular research project in the lab of a
Stanford physician-scientist faculty mentor. The remaining 20% of their time will be spent in a comprehensive
curriculum comprised of seminars in cardiovascular science, research training, physician-scientist career
development opportunities and social events. To accomplish the second goal of preparing trainees for innovative
research in translational medicine, students will be exposed to scientific opportunities that are especially enriched
at Stanford. Precision medicine, industry collaborations, and familiarity with clinical trials are all important
components of the research endeavors for future physician-scientists. To accomplish our third goal of providing
trainees with a strong foundation in rigor, reproducibility and the responsible conduct of research, we will provide
a dedicated curriculum to address these topics under the guidance of leaders in the fields of research ethics and
the philosophy of science. The program’s success and longevity will be monitored and improved upon through
a robust plan for internal and external evaluation. The Program Directors and faculty mentors for this T35 have
ongoing state-of-the-art cardiovascular research programs spanning basic, translational, clinical, and population
level domains. Together they have the mentoring expertise and the available resources to support this T35
summer research program, which will train a diverse cohort of medical students to become responsible,
collaborative, and innovative physician-scientists."

 This application requests a second renewal for our Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award
(NRSA) Institutional Research Training Grant (T32) entitled “Training in Botanical Approaches to Combat
Metabolic Syndrome.” This training program is a collaborative effort between the Pennington Biomedical
Research Center of Louisiana State University and the Departments of Plant Biology and Food Science at
Rutgers University. The objective of this program is to train the highest caliber of postdoctoral fellows to become
productive scientists integrating biomedical research methods and botanical discovery research with the
capability of establishing successful scientific careers in academia, academic medicine, governmental agencies,
and in the private sector. Metabolic syndrome is prevalent, poses a significant threat to public health, and it is
characterized by the presence of co-existing traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease (e.g. hypertension,
dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, obesity and insulin resistance). Preventative approaches for metabolic
syndrome often primarily focus on lifestyle interventions. However, maintenance of lifestyle changes over time
is poor. Thus, nutritional supplementation with botanicals that effectively address pathogenic mechanisms,
combined with the acceptance and widespread use of supplements by the general public, present an attractive,
novel and potentially effective approach to combat metabolic syndrome. Therefore, research training provided
by this T32 will be directed toward evaluating the interactions between botanical characterization and the
molecular, genetic, and physiologic approaches to achieve the ultimate goal of understanding how botanicals
can contribute to health and normal tissue function. The program emphasizes hands on research training in an
environment that encourages and facilitates transdisciplinary research and team science. The program will also
benefit from the synergy and cutting-edge technologies of the NCCIH-sponsored Botanical Dietary Supplements
Research Center (BDSRC) also focused on botanical supplements and metabolic syndrome. This integration
between the T32 and the BDSRC provides trainees the opportunity to pursue studies with investigators whose
interest span all organ systems impacted by obesity and metabolic syndrome. Since it began in 2009, this T32
program has graduated 15 postdocs who have remained in research-oriented careers and have acquired 30
grants (8 from NIH). Eleven graduates are now in academia and four are in industry. Seven postdocs are still in
training. In total, this program’s 22 trainees have published 124 papers on their T32 projects including 66 first
author papers. We are requesting 7 full-time postdoctoral trainee positions per year (5 at Pennington Biomedical
and 2 at Rutgers) for the next five-year grant cycle (2020-2025). Trainees will be supported for two to three
years. Each postdoctoral fellow will be encouraged to develop interdisciplinary research efforts to understand
the effects of botanicals on components of metabolic syndrome."
10832634,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The prevalence of diabetes in Kentucky is ~25% higher than the national average, and rural areas within
Kentucky face an even higher burden of diabetes and its related complications. Diabetes self-management
education and support (DSMES) services are integral to quality diabetes care. Substantial evidence shows that
DSMES participation improves diabetes outcomes and is cost-effective. Despite strong evidence of benefit and
clear guidelines from the American Diabetes Association recommending its use, <10% of eligible individuals
complete DSMES. Determinants that contribute to low DSMES uptake exist at multiple levels and include
clinician awareness, geographic availability, cost and reimbursement, and referral mechanisms. Although the
Kentucky Department of Public Health administers a statewide DSMES program that is free to participants and
available face-to-face in 80/120 counties and by telehealth in all counties, DSMES utilization remains low
across Kentucky. In response to the current RFA seeking to test innovative and pragmatic approaches to
facilitate greater use of DSMES, we propose testing and evaluating a clinic-level intervention that implements
health information technology (automated patient identification and a bidirectional referral system) to reduce
barriers related to identification and referral of eligible patients and engages clinical teams in a practice
facilitation collaborative to increase clinician awareness and overcome clinic-level barriers. We will achieve this
through three aims: 1) Planning – implementation science-guided evaluation and adaptation of an existing pilot
diabetes clinical quality improvement program; 2) Implementation – of the adapted intervention; and 3)
Evaluation - of intervention components using the Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model
(PRISM). We will adapt the proposed intervention from a successful pilot project that used health information
technology and a collaborative quality improvement approach to increase DSMES utilization at participating
clinics by >100%. We will use a pragmatic cluster randomized study design to evaluate implementation
effectiveness and will use an implementation science framework to guide evaluation of the feasibility,
acceptability, and sustainability of the intervention. To achieve the study aims, we have partnered with the
Kentucky Department of Public Health (DSMES provider), the Kentucky Regional Extension Cooperative
(practice facilitation partner), Kentucky Health Information Exchange (health information technology partner)
and two healthcare systems in rural Kentucky. This pilot and feasibility study will provide insight on pragmatic,
scalable, and sustainable strategies to increase DSMES utilization. Findings will generate key preliminary data
that will guide planning of an R01-level dissemination and implementation trial with the goal of reducing
diabetes-related morbidity and mortality."
10833024,"ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a significant concern in adults living with HIV (AHIV) on antiretroviral
therapy (ART). Little is known about subclinical or early upstream CVD pathogenesis in youth living with
perinatally acquired HIV (YPHIV) who stand to benefit the most from early identification of subclinical CVD.
ART expansion has reduced pediatric HIV mortality, allowing YPHIV to reach adulthood, but not without
lifelong exposure to immune activation, inflammation, and ART, all of which potentiate CVD. Several studies
including ours have shown subclinical myocardial dysfunction in YPHIV, but few have evaluated underlying
metabolic pathways or been conducted with well-matched comparison groups of youth living with non-
perinatally acquired HIV (YNPHIV) and HIV-unexposed uninfected (HUU) youth in sub-Saharan Africa, where
currently 90% of the world’s children with HIV reside. We have demonstrated high rates (25%) of right
ventricular systolic dysfunction and insulin resistance (21%) in our cohort of South African YPHIV. In addition,
our YPHIV have an increased risk for endothelial dysfunction and dyslipidemia compared to uninfected youth.
However, detailed sensitive imaging data to comprehensively measure myocardial and vascular dysfunction
are urgently needed in YPHIV to understand the role of these precursors in end conditions such as heart
failure and CVD which we have shown to be more prevalent in AHIV. In addition, studies in YPHIV of
underlying metabolic pathways involved in early/primordial factors across the cascade of myocardial/vascular
dysfunction resulting in CVD are lacking and critical to providing insight into early prediction and potential
mitigation of the development of cardiometabolic complications among YPHIV into adulthood. For this proposal
we will leverage the Cape Town Adolescent and Antiretroviral Cohort (CTAAC) to assess whether ART-treated
perinatally acquired HIV is associated with worsened subclinical myocardial or vascular dysfunction over time
using YNPHIV and HUU youth comparison groups of similar age, sex, and body surface area (BSA) and
employing cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), a sensitive multiparametric method of
investigating multiple cardiovascular domains. Next, we will use novel metabolomics techniques to explore
whether a signature cluster of intermediary or proinflammatory metabolites representing eicosanoid
imbalances and mitochondrial shifts in fatty acid oxidation are different in YPHIV compared to YNPHIV or HUU
youth and are associated with subclinical myocardial or vascular dysfunction in YPHIV. Lastly, we will explore
how inflammation correlates with these eicosanoid imbalances and mitochondrial shifts in fatty acid oxidation in
YPHIV. These results will expand our understanding of the pathogenesis and interplay between metabolic
dysregulation and subclinical myocardial dysfunction as well as elucidate key pathways of cardiac dysfunction
which may identify those YPHIV at highest risk for CVD, informing future potentially targetable interventions
such as dietary measures to alter metabolic fuel utilization or possible immune-modulating therapy."

This proposed R18 is in response to the RFA-HS-23-002 Dissemination and Implementation of Equity-Focused
Evidence-Based Interventions in Healthcare Delivery Systems. Chinese immigrants are the second largest
immigrant group in the U.S., who suffer a disproportionately high type 2 diabetes (T2D) burden and have poor
diabetes outcomes. Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support (DSMES) programs are evidence-
based interventions that provide patients with important counseling and support to navigate diabetes self-
management at home. However, numerous social determinants of health (SDOH) barriers limit the
dissemination of DSMES programs to Chinese immigrants, including high rates of poverty, limited English
proficiency (LEP), and lack of access to care and insurance. Given the high T2D burden and rapid population
growth in Chinese immigrants, there is an urgent need for research to disseminate and implement DSMES in
this minority population. The overarching goal for our proposed R18 IDEAL study (Implementing an effective
Diabetes intervEntion Among Low-income immigrants) is to test the effectiveness and implementation process
of an innovative multi-level care model for delivering a culturally tailored diabetes intervention to low-income
Chinese immigrants with diabetes. Building upon our strong pilot data and established partnerships with clinical
and community partners in Chinese immigrant communities, we propose to conduct a type 1 hybrid study to
examine the effectiveness and implementation process of the IDEAL intervention for glycemic control among
270 Chinese immigrants with uncontrolled T2D in NYC. Participants will be randomized with equal allocation to
one of the two groups. The IDEAL group will receive 1 culturally and linguistically tailored DSMES brief
video/week for 24 weeks delivered via text message links plus bi-weekly support calls from a CHW for 24
weeks. The CHW will assess participants’ SDOH barriers to T2D care and link them to available resources in
the community. The wait-list control (hereafter CONTROL) group will continue to receive usual care and at the
end of the study, they will receive DSMES videos. The primary outcome is HbA1c at 6 months and secondary
outcomes include HbA1c at 12 months and psychosocial factors at 6 and 12 months. This study addresses the
urgent need to disseminate and implement evidence-based diabetes interventions in underserved populations
to reduce health disparities. Study findings will provide important evidence on potential scalable strategies to
foster the dissemination of effective implementation, replication, and sustainability of evidence-based
interventions for use in healthcare and community settings. It can also serve as a program model for other high
risk LEP immigrant populations such as Hispanic immigrants who also bear a high T2D burden, face similar
SDOH barriers to accessing DSMES programs, and frequently use text messages."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia with
high heritability (~70%). It is increasingly clear that AD is highly polygenic, and for most of AD cases it is the
polygenicity of the risk variants across the genome that predisposes the disease risk. In contrast to the rapid
identification of risk loci associated with AD by recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS), identifying the
potential causal variants/genes at the reported risk loci and decoding these variants/genes into molecular and
cellular pathology have lagged far behind. Since disease variants, mostly locating in noncoding regions of the
human genome, have been shown to affect cellular function through multi-level regulations such as DNA
accessibility and histone modifications, DNA methylation and RNA expression in a cell type-specific manner,
comprehensive and unbiased investigating the cell type-specific influence of generic risk variants on AD risk at
multiple levels, including epigenomic, transcriptomic, and cellular levels, in an isogenic background is crucial to
understand the genetic basis of AD pathogenesis. In the current application, by combining human induced
pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) with gene editing and comprehensive multi-omics and cellular analyses, we will
dissect the AD genetic risk variants into cell type-specific molecular and cellular pathology. Given the polygenic
nature of AD, and the heterogeneity of AD risk genes on the cellular level, we hypothesize that multiple genetic
risk variants act synergistically among different compartments (e.g. cell types) to contribute to pathogenesis of
AD. First, we will identify AD risk variants and genes with comprehensive analyses of AD genetic architecture
using machine learning approaches including DVAR, eVAR and iRIGS (Aim 1). Second, we will delineate the
cell type-specific epigenetic and transcriptomic signatures associated with AD candidate risk variants using
human iPSC-derived neurons/microglia/astrocytes (Aim 2). Last, we will determine the functional impact of AD
candidate risk variants on AD-like cellular pathology in neurons, microglia, astrocytes, and their co-cultures (Aim
3). Our proposal may advance our understanding of the complex genetic architecture of AD, leading to a better
understanding of AD pathogenesis and facilitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies."

Survivors of preterm birth are commonly diagnosed with persistent white matter injury (WMI) that leads to a
failure of normal myelination. Myelination failure results in life long motor and neurobehavioral disabilities. The
central feature of WMI is the so-called “glial scar,” an inhibitory barrier generated by reactive astrocytes, which
causes myelination failure by blocking the maturation of oligodendrocyte progenitors. It is our long-term
objective to develop novel therapies to prevent myelination failure by preventing glial scar formation.
There are no therapeutic strategies to prevent early formation of diffuse reactive astrogliosis before it
chronically blocks myelination.
WMI disrupts the integrity of the hyaluronic acid (HA) backbone of the extracellular matrix. We have defined a
novel pathway through which small ~5 kDa HA oligomers (HA5) regulate the proliferation of astroglial
progenitors and promote reactive astrogliosis. Through the enzyme tumor
necrosis
factor-
(TNF)
stimulated
gene-6 (TSG-6), HA5 serves as a sink that traps heavy chain (HC) protein subunits of the inter-alpha-inhibitor
protein (II) complex. This reaction generates unstable intermediates of II that release HC. We have
identified novel approaches to block this TSG-6-dependent pathway to markedly attenuate the formation of the
glial scar. Our over-riding hypothesis is that HA5-mediated HC release promotes reactive astrogliosis
via a src family kinase-dependent pathway. We propose three specific aims to test this hypothesis. In aim
1, we hypothesize that hyaluronidase activation in the glial scar promotes the formation of HA5. We will
determine the hyaluronidases (HYAL) that generate HA5 to promote formation of the glial scar and determine if
a broad spectrum HYAL inhibitor reduces astrogliosis in response to WMI. In aim 2, we will test the
hypothesis that HA5 promotes astrocyte proliferation and reactive astrogliosis through TSG-6-dependent
release of heavy chains derived from II. We will determine if astrocyte proliferation in WMI is dependent on
TSG-6 expression that promotes astrogliosis in vitro and in vivo via an HC-dependent mechanism. In aim 3,
we hypothesize that activation of TSG-6 mediates glial scar formation via activation of src family kinases. We
will first determine if a TSG-6 blocking antibody inhibits proliferation of astrocyte progenitors in vivo. We will
test a src kinase inhibitor, currently in clinical trials, as a novel strategy to block glial scar formation and
promote myelination. At the conclusion of these studies, we expect to define new therapeutic strategies to
intervene during early WMI to prevent formation of the glial scar and promote myelination. Given that reactive
astrogliosis is a central feature of many forms of CNS injury, our findings may have potential benefit for other
pediatric and adult neurological disorders with prominent WMI."

Children in families with healthcare communication in a language other than English (LOE) are at increased
risk of worse asthma care and outcomes compared to those without a language barrier. There is a gap in
knowledge about effectiveness and implementation outcomes of interventions to address asthma disparities for
children in LOE families. Asthma navigators play a key role in asthma education and care coordination,
resulting in improved asthma outcomes. Our local model of asthma navigation and care coordination to support
meeting social determinants of health needs using a lay health worker model has improved asthma outcomes
among urban racial/ethnic minority children but has not focused on children in LOE families. To address this
gap, we propose, the Navigating Toward Equitable Asthma Management Program (Nav-TEAM) intervention,
an adaptation of evidence-based asthma navigation specifically for children in families who communicate in
LOE. As with existing asthma navigation programs at our health system, Nav-TEAM will align with EXHALE,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Asthma Control Program compilation of asthma
management strategies that have been proven to reduce asthma-related healthcare utilization and costs. The
overall scientific goals of this community-engaged study are to: evaluate the effectiveness of Nav-TEAM on
pediatric asthma outcomes for 280 children whose families communicate in LOE, evaluate implementation
outcomes and application of implementation strategies, and assess cost and contextual factors to support
sustained implementation, scale up and scale out. The study will be implemented in a large primary care clinic
serving primarily Medicaid-insured children and in subspecialty pediatric pulmonary clinics using the Practical,
Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) - inclusive of RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness,
Adoption, Implementation Maintenance outcomes with an equity lens – as the guiding Dissemination &
Implementation Science framework. We will use community-engaged processes to tailor asthma navigation for
LOE families in primary and subspecialty pediatric pulmonary care settings at Children’s Hospital of Colorado,
a large academic children’s health system serving urban and rural patients. Subsequently, we will conduct a
hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial to simultaneously evaluate the effectiveness of Nav-TEAM at
reducing asthma-related emergency department use among children with asthma age 4-14 years using a
pragmatic randomized controlled trial as well as a mixed methods assessment of implementation using
PRISM/RE-AIM focusing on equity. We will then assess cost, sustainability and contextual domains to
understand factors that enable implementation, sustainability, and scale-out of Nav-TEAM. Results from this
study will provide information on the effectiveness and implementation of evidence-based asthma navigation
adapted specifically for families who communicate in LOE, and will offer lessons that we will capture in an
implementation and sustainability guide to promote scaling to other clinical settings."

Male smoking prevalence in Viet Nam is one of the highest in the world (45%), and smoking rates are even
higher among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) (59%). PLWH who smoke are at increased risk of excess
morbidity and premature death compared with nonsmokers. Yet, in Viet Nam treatment is not integrated as a
routine part of care in outpatient HIV clinics (OPCs). Our long-term goal is to develop a scalable model for
implementing evidence-based tobacco use treatment (TUT) in health care settings treating PLWH in LMICs
like Viet Nam. The objective of this study is to conduct a 3-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) that
compares the cost-effectiveness of three multi-component interventions that are embedded in OPCs: 1)
3As+R (Standard Care (SC)): Ask about tobacco use, Advise to quit, Assist (brief counseling), and Refer to
Viet Nam’s national Quitline; 2) SC+Counsel (Counsel=6-session cessation counseling intervention adapted
for PLWH and delivered by a trained, onsite clinic staff; and 3) SC+Counsel+N (N=nicotine replacement
therapy (NRT)). The primary outcome of this type 1 hybrid implementation trial is the effectiveness of the
intervention (6-month tobacco abstinence) and secondary outcomes are measures of contextual factors that
may influence implementation and sustainability. Patients (n=672) will be recruited from 14 OPCs in two cities
in Viet Nam and randomized into one of 3 study arms. The proposal builds on findings from the team’s 2-arm
NCI-funded cluster RCT (VQUIT) that compared two implementation strategies for increasing adoption of TUT
guidelines in 26 health centers that provide primary care for a general population in Viet Nam. In VQUIT, which
was implemented prior to the availability of the Quitline, clinicians in the intervention sites referred tobacco
users to a trained village health worker (VHW) for 3-session cessation counseling. Control sites included a 3As
only model and no referral option. Patients receiving VHW-delivered counseling plus clinician-delivered
cessation advise and counseling (3As+R) had higher biochemically validated 6-month quit rates compared with
those who received 3As only (25.7% vs.10.5%; p<.001). This proposal builds logically on this prior work. We
will conduct formative research to further adapt and tailor the VQUIT materials to the sociocultural context of
PLWH and to the HIV clinical context. We will then compare the 3As+R model (Standard care (SC) now with
Quitline referral) to two enhanced models of TUT that offer: a) more intensive counseling adapted for PLWH
and delivered by HIV clinicians (SC+Counsel), and b) dispensing of NRT (SC+Counsel+N). The specific aims
are to: 1) Adapt and tailor the intervention to PLWH and HIV care settings, 2) Conduct a 3-arm RCT comparing
the cost effectiveness of three models of care based on biochemically validated 6-month smoking abstinence;
and 3) Evaluate multilevel factors that facilitate or impede implementation and potential for sustainability of
TUT in HIV treatment settings in Viet Nam."

People living in poor rural communities in the South live shorter and less healthy lives than those residing
elsewhere in the United States. The basis of this very high rural burden of heart, lung and blood diseases
(HLBS), which does not spare any race, is unclear. Within the same Southern regions, however, there are
counties with very low risk of disease that have profiles of poverty, race/ethnicity, and rurality similar to the high
risk ones. Therefore, we do not understand which factors amplify risk in the rural South, and what renders
some communities resilient but others more vulnerable. To study this problem, we will recruit a RURAL (Risk
Underlying Rural Areas Longitudinal Study) cohort of 4000 participants (age 35-64 years, 50% women; 44%
whites, 45% blacks, 10% Hispanic) from ten of the poorest rural counties in four Southern states (Kentucky,
Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana). We will target six higher risk and four lower risk rural counties `paired
within state' for their degree of poverty, race/ethnic composition, and their total population sizes.
Using a self-contained mobile examination unit (with a CT scanner and digital technology), we will conduct an
examination to: characterize the local built, social and economic environments; assess familial, lifestyle factors,
and medical history; assay standard and novel HLBS risk factors, including genetic risk; evaluate lung function;
measure subclinical disease burden (CT scan for coronary calcium and lung disease; ankle-brachial index;
pulse wave velocity); test physiological responses to postural change, handgrip, a 6-minute walk, and an oral
glucose load; appraise the utility of mHealth tools in rural settings with `take-home' smartphones and wearable
activity monitors; build bio- and data-repositories, and robust community collaboratives for current and future
studies. Surveillance of participants will help us to identify and adjudicate/validate new HLBS disease events.
Our central hypothesis is that differences in the HLBS risk among people living in these 10 high- and low-risk
rural Southern counties arise from the synergistic interaction among diverse exposures. An adverse exposome
creates greater `wear and tear' of the body, affects psychosocial well-being, and impacts lifestyle choices that
influence HLBS risk. Increased genetic predisposition, greater poverty, and minority status all exacerbate risk.
We will test this hypothesis with the following aims: Aim 1. Characterize the exposome comprehensively at the
individual and at the community-level in RURAL participants, and relate it to biological function and HLBS risk
cross-sectionally; study how these associations may be modified by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and residence in
a high vs. low-risk county. Aim 2. Relate the exposome to the incidence of HLBS disease prospectively, and
evaluate effect modification by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and residence in a high vs. low-risk AMD county. We
will analyze the collected data and publish our results, and share major findings with these rural communities.
RURAL will inform us about what causes the burden of HLBS disease in the rural South and how to alleviate it."

 Obesity and excess adiposity at the time of breast cancer diagnosis are associated with increased
likelihood of recurrence and cancer-related death. Understanding the mechanisms by which excess adiposity
affects breast cancer progression would provide critical insights into strategies to improve patient outcomes.
We have identified a novel tissue-based inflammatory biomarker in breast adipose tissue, crown-like structures
of the breast (CLS-B), that we have shown to be associated with obesity and dysregulated metabolic factors.
The presence of CLS-B, which are comprised of an adipocyte surrounded by a “crown” of macrophages,
indicates a state of inflammation in the breast white adipose tissue (B-WATi). We previously reported that B-
WATi is associated with metabolic syndrome characteristics. Importantly, B-WATi is associated with increased
breast cancer risk and shortened time to recurrence in women with metastatic disease.
 The Pathways Study, a prospective cohort study of women with invasive breast cancer supported by an
NCI cancer epidemiology cohort infrastructure grant, provides an outstanding opportunity to conduct a large-
scale, definitive investigation of the pathophysiologic state associated with B-WATi, and to investigate the
association of B-WATi with breast cancer outcomes. From January 2006 to May 2013, we enrolled a racially-
and ethnically-diverse cohort of 4,505 women soon after a breast cancer diagnosis in Kaiser Permanente
Northern California (KPNC). Pathways Study participants provided blood specimens and reported on lifestyle
factors, including diet and physical activity. Linkage to KPNC electronic health records captures details of
cancer diagnosis and clinical care, and a biorepository of diagnostic slides and formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded tissue blocks has been created from definitive breast cancer surgeries for all cohort members.
 We propose to determine B-WATi presence and severity in Pathways Study participants who underwent
mastectomy (n=1,982), leveraging the substantial non-tumor breast tissue available in the biorepository. We
also propose to assay systemic measures of inflammation and metabolic aberration, and examine measures of
adipose tissue distribution in a subset of women with computed tomography (CT) images. Specific Aims are
to: 1) Characterize the pathophysiological state of B-WATi in women with invasive breast cancer, including
associations with lifestyle factors, adipose tissue distribution, and circulating cytokine and metabolic profiles; 2)
Determine the associations between B-WATi and breast cancer outcomes; and, 3) Examine whether the
associations between B-WATi and breast cancer outcomes vary by lifestyle factors and other breast cancer
prognostic factors such as race/ethnicity, hormone receptor status, stage of disease, and breast cancer
treatment. This project brings together ground-breaking and innovative work on B-WATi with the outstanding
resources and infrastructure of the Pathways Study. It promises to provide insight into the impact of B-WATi
on breast cancer and to identify actionable and modifiable risk factors to improve breast cancer outcomes."

Although the rate of new HIV infections has decreased, containment and eventual eradication of the HIV
pandemic remains a top priority in contemporary biomedical research. One of the major challenges to HIV cure
is the need to restore normal immune function in order to effectively eliminate the established viral reservoir. We
have assembled in RID-HIV: “Reversing Immune Dysfunction for HIV-1 eradication”, basic and clinical scientists
with expertise in virology, immunology, microbiome biology, epigenetics, and systems biology. In addition, Merck
Research Laboratories will invest significant intellectual, human and material resources to complement the
efforts of the academic scientists. The RID-HIV Collaboratory will collectively function to explore the underlying
basis of the immune dysregulation in HIV-infected individuals and the impact it has on reservoir persistence and
viral rebound control. We will test for the first time several innovative concepts, including identifying epigenetic
mechanisms imprinted by the microbiome and host and bacterial metabolomes that prevents the development
of effective innate and adaptive immune responses that can control the size, quality and anatomical localization
of the HIV reservoir. The overarching goal of the RID-HIV Collaboratory is to provide preclinical in vivo proof-of-
concept for a therapeutic paradigm that encompasses immune restorative treatments, used in concert with
enhanced viral reactivation and elimination strategies, in order to deliver a HIV-1 cure. We propose three highly
integrated and complementary scientific Research Foci (RFs), to be supported by rigorous and iterative modeling
of outcomes and shaped by our outreach to the HIV community. In RF1 we will investigate the mechanisms
whereby host- and microbiome-derived metabolites impact innate immune responses and influence the
maintenance of the latent viral reservoir. In RF2 we will pursue the hypothesis that in ART/ATI clinical cohorts,
metabolites that govern innate immunity shape the adaptive immune responses that could prevent viral rebound
upon treatment interruption. In addition, we will evaluate the capacity of engineered allogenic stem memory T
cells to provide superior cognate help to promote the effector functions of antiviral CD8 T cells, and will assess
the ability of FDA-approved and novel immune modulators to reset this baseline immune dysfunction and
enhance the function of this novel cell therapy product. In RF 3 we will optimize a best-in-class latency reversal
agent (LRA) and identify clinical-stage molecules with synergistic LRA activity. Clearance of reactivated cells will
be enhanced using a novel strategy for NK cell recruitment and by genetically modifying B cells to produce
broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies that enhance reservoir clearance. Finally, gene editing will be deployed for
in vivo targeting and elimination of latent provirus not amenable to LRAs. The outcomes of studies in RF1, RF2
and RF3 will enable the synthesis of a predictive mathematical model to establish the most likely combinations
of therapies to achieve an HIV-1 cure, and which will be tested in a capstone aim to establish proof-of-concept
for these strategies in NHP models and to enable translation to the clinic."

Molecular Biology and Genetics of Human Tumor Viruses
Paul F. Lambert, PI
Viruses cause approximately 15% of human cancers. A viral etiology to a human cancer can have substantive
consequences on its treatment and prevention. For example, many virally-caused human cancers express virally
encoded products, which are potential targets for anti-viral, tumor-specific therapies. In addition, unique sets of
cellular genes and pathways contribute to virally-associated cancers, many of which are currently being pursued
as targets for anti-cancer therapies. This program project grant (PPG), now in its 45th year of continual funding,
has two major objectives: to use molecular biology and genetics to elucidate the life cycles of and transformation
by human tumor viruses and to translate this understanding into the identification of targets for specific anti-viral,
anti-tumor therapies. The PPG has seven lead investigators who share these research goals in studying multiple
human tumor viruses in two different virus families: papillomaviruses, and herpesviruses. Together, these
viruses cause the vast majority of virally-associated human cancers. The PPG has been highly productive over
the current funding period with 88 studies published of which 33% involve two or more labs, reflecting on the
strong synergies arising from the PPG.
Our PPG has a unique organization in which each of four projects have two or more labs working together on a
common theme in human tumor virology. Cross-fertilization of ideas and expertise between projects is fostered
by having many of the seven investigators participating in multiple projects. This interactive and collaborative
organization has been highly fruitful over the current funding period in several regards. Firstly, each project has
been productive and has collaborated with other projects. Secondly, innovative new ideas and approaches have
arisen, many of which are now being used across multiple projects. Thirdly, the collaborative environment
created by this PPG has spawned new interactions that have brought additional expertise to the PPG. The
specific themes of this PPG are: 1) Characterize the Mechanism by Which Papillomaviruses Evade Host
Immunity; 2) Uncovering Mechanisms of the Lymphoid Oncogenesis of Epstein-Barr Virus and Kaposi’s
Sarcoma Herpesvirus; 3) Latent and Lytic EBV Infection in Epithelial Cells; and 4) Defining the Role of EBV in
DLBCL Pathogenesis and Identification of Therapeutic Targets. Three cores provide expertise in A)
administration, statistics and bioinformatics, B) instrumentation, microscopy and histology, and C) virus
engineering and production."

Project 1. Characterize the Mechanism by Which Papillomaviruses Evade Host Immunity
Paul Lambert, Project Leader; Paul Ahlquist and Paul Sondel, Co-Leaders
A subset of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause 5% of human cancers including the majority of cervical
cancers, which is an AIDS-defining malignancy. During the current funding period, we discovered a host factor
induced by papillomaviruses that contributes to the ability of this virus to evade host immune responses, allowing
it to establish persistent infections that can lead to cancer. This discovery was made using a mouse
papillomavirus infection model. Evidence supports the hypothesis that high-risk anogenital HPVs use this same
mechanism. We further discovered that this host factor contributes to resistance to immune checkpoint blockade
immunotherapy (ICI) in both mouse and human head and neck cancers. In this project we will explore further
the mechanisms underlying immune evasion by HPV using a new model for inducible expression of HPV16
oncogenes in immunocompetent mice that better models HPV-induced carcinogenesis in humans, focusing on
anal cancer because its frequency of occurrence is increasing, especially amongst people living with HIV
(PLWH). During the current funding period, we also discovered that estrogen, which we and others have
previously determined contributes to HPV-mediated cervical carcinogenesis, promotes persistent infection by
mouse papillomavirus at least in part by suppressing host immunity, leading to increased severity of
cervicovaginal neoplasia including cancer in mice. We describe experiments to determine how estrogen affects
host immunity, and how to block it to improve response to ICI. The studies described in this project are designed
to learn how to convert HPV-associated cancers that tend to be immunologically cold, ICI-unresponsive tumors
to immunologically hot, ICI-responsive tumors, with the ultimate goal to translate our findings to the clinic."

10837849,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive primary brain tumor with a dismal 5-year
survival rate (~ 5 %). GBM metastasizes to different brain regions which makes surgical resection
difficult. Despite radiation therapy and chemotherapy, the median survival timeline is dire at 15
months. The major challenges in GBM therapy include late diagnosis, metastasis, resistance to
chemotherapeutics, and drug delivery issues due to blood-brain barrier. Thus, efforts towards
developing novel pharmacotherapies for GBM are highly warranted. Cancer cells rewire their
metabolic pathways that are intimately linked to oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. The
metabolic reprogramming confers GBM several advantages in survival, proliferation, metastasis,
drug resistance, and immune evasion. In addition, recent research in the cancer metabolism field
has revealed an important ‘lactate shuttle’ that explains the key role of lactate transfer from
systemic circulation into tumor microenvironment. Lactate utilization is highly relevant for brain
tumors such as GBM. Our long-term goal is to pharmacologically target tumor metabolic
reprogramming for cancer therapy. Towards that goal, we screened a number of metabolic
inhibitors in GBM cells that uncovered effectiveness of an FDA-approved antiepileptic drug
stiripentol with its putative target lactate dehydrogenase. The objective of this study is to elucidate
molecular mechanism and changes in cancer biology by stiripentol treatment in GBM cells and
GBM in vivo models. In addition, we will study structure-activity relationships of novel derivatives
identified from stiripentol scaffold to develop potent inhibitors. Additionally, formulations of
stiripentol and potent lead compounds will be developed and tested in the tumor xenograft model
of U87 xenografts. Our research will offer novel insights in the mechanistic pharmacology of
stiripentol and can lead to the development of candidate therapeutics for GBM treatment."
10837851,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Every year, >1 million patients undergo bone repair procedures in the United States. Autologous bone grafting
remains the preferred treatment for bone defects, but this practice is limited by bone availability and donor site
morbidity. Alternatively, the development of therapies that exploit the osteogenic potential of bone marrow-
derived mesenchymal stem cells (bm-MSCs) continues to be a priority in regenerative medicine. However, efforts
remain largely empirical due to a poor understanding of the mechanisms regulating bm-MSC osteogenic activity
in vivo. Our overarching goal is to elucidate the mechanisms regulating ossification and develop therapeutic
strategies for bone regeneration using autologous bm-MSCs. Previously, we showed that preserving human
bm-MSCs' osteogenic potential depends on sustaining proximity to endothelial cells (ECs). More recently, we
have found that the type of ECs drastically affects bm-MSC fate in vivo. Specifically, vascular networks lined by
human trabecular bone arteriole ECs (tba-ECs) could spontaneously induce osteogenic differentiation of bm-
MSCs. In contrast, non-bone ECs could not. Our Preliminary Data suggest that the expression of KITLG drives
this unique osteoinductive potential. Indeed, silencing KITLG in tba-ECs completely abrogated osteogenesis
upon implantation in vivo, whereas overexpressing KITLG in non-bone ECs conferred robust osteoinductive
properties. Our data also suggest that KITLG expression in tba-ECs is regulated by type I interferon (IFN)
signaling, a previously unknown link. Our central hypothesis is that a constitutive IFN-KITLG mechanism drives
the distinct osteoinductive properties of human tba-ECs. We also postulate that educating induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPSCs) could offer a plentiful source of surrogate tba-ECs, eliminating the need for harvesting
autologous bone. To test these hypotheses, we propose three specific aims. In Aim-1, we will dissect the
mechanism by which human tba-ECs mediates osteogenesis via KITLG expression. We will determine which
KITLG isoform (soluble vs. membrane-bound) is indispensable and dissect the role of recruited c-Kit+
hematopoietic progenitor cells (c-Kit+ HPCs) in osteogenesis. In Aim-2, we will determine the molecular
mechanism that regulates KITLG expression in human tba-ECs. We will use a CRISPR/Cas9 loss‐of‐function
approach to silence components of the type I IFN pathway and unravel the interactions between IFN signaling
mediators and the enhancer-promoter region of the KITLG gene. In Aim-3, we will pursue strategies to educate
human iPSC-derived ECs to acquire osteoinductive function, including transient activation of KITLG and IFN
signaling. In summary, these studies will define the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which human tba-
ECs regulate the osteogenic differentiation of bm-MSCs and, in turn, ossification. This fundamental knowledge
will form the foundation for strategies to promote bone repair and regeneration."

Dr. Peyton Thompson is an Assistant Professor of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at the University of North
Carolina (UNC) who is applying for a K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development Award. Dr.
Thompson’s long-term career goal is to become an independent physician-scientist with expertise in
vaccinology and the epidemiology of vaccine-preventable diseases in low-resource settings.
The prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is unacceptably high in sub-Saharan Africa given that there is an
effective vaccine against HBV. In order to design improved vaccination strategies to protect vulnerable
individuals against HBV, we must first address two important HBV-related knowledge gaps: 1) Geospatial
drivers of HBV infection in African children, and 2) HBV household transmission patterns in African children.
This proposal will address these knowledge gaps using epidemiological data and dried-blood spot samples
from a large national survey in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
This application will address the following specific aims: Aim 1) Locate hotspots of high HBV prevalence and
low population-level immunity among Congolese children using existing DBS samples from a nationally
representative survey; Aim 2) Identify patterns of HBV transmission at the household level using phylogenetic
approaches; and Aim 3) Estimate the impact of targeted vaccination strategies in the DRC using modeling
techniques. These aims align with Dr. Thompson’s career development goals: 1) Training in epidemiological
and spatial analyses of large data repositories; 2) Training in vaccinology; and 3) Training in impact modeling.
To achieve these goals, Dr. Thompson has assembled a highly qualified mentorship team comprised of: her
primary mentor, Dr. Sylvia Becker-Dreps, a global health researcher with expertise in vaccine-preventable
diseases; her co-mentor, Dr. Steven Meshnick, a skilled epidemiologist with vast experience in the DRC; an
internal advisory committee consisting of experts in analysis of large data (Dr. Jonathan Parr), hepatology (Dr.
Michael Fried), spatial analyses (Dr. Michael Emch) and vaccinology (Dr. David Weber). This multidisciplinary
team of NIH-funded researchers has an impressive track record of training junior investigators toward
independent research careers. Under their supervision, Dr. Thompson will achieve the research and career
development aims in this proposal, and will be prepared to apply for an R01 to implement and evaluate
spatially targeted vaccination strategies specific to the DRC."

The University of Houston (UH) has approximately 400 faculty (~150 from communities
underrepresented in the health sciences) conducting health-related research. These faculty span 12
Colleges and 28 academic units. This recent environmental scan suggests (1) there is a natural wellspring
of scientists from a broad range of health disciplines that can leverage the Research Infrastructure Core (RIC)
to advance their research; and (2) there is a tremendous opportunity to engage more scientists in innovative
health-equity science that can discover novel solutions to disparities in addictions and cancer prevention
afflicting our underserved and marginalized communities in Houston and beyond. The RIC will be executed by
experienced scientists that are passionate about health-equity science. Ultimately, the proposed RCMI is
uniquely situated to aggressively launch a centralized RIC capable of actualizing four specific aims: Aim 1.
Execute a centralized research infrastructure that will enhance the scientific rigor, productivity,
and impact of addictions and cancer prevention research at UH. Plan: Deliver state-of-the-art core services in
the areas of (1) Research Methodology; (2) Laboratory Techniques and Facilities; (3) Data Management and
Biostatistics; (4) Health Informatics; and (5) Responsible Conduct of Research, Ethics, and Compliance in
health-disparities research; Aim 2. Develop an intellectual incubator that generates transdisciplinary
research teams linking investigators underrepresented in the health sciences with established investigators
at UH. Plan: Execute a comprehensive marketing plan that targets and encourages University leadership,
faculty, and postdoctoral fellows to leverage RIC services to advance their science while taking the opportunity
to build new transdisciplinary research teams that pursue novel solutions to complex health challenges; Aim 3.
Provide dynamic core services for RCMI scientists that are cost-effective, accessible, efficient, and with
excellent customer service. Plan: Execute a user-friendly electronic ticketing and tracking system that will
monitor service utilization and satisfaction in real-time, while also informing the data-driven redistribution of
resources to maximize end-user needs and demonstrate a substantial return-on-investment; Aim 4. Pursue
collaborations that minimize University duplication of resources and build bridges with local and national
exemplars. Plan: Work with the Directors of the local and national exemplars to engage in a shared vision that
advances health-equity science. Ultimately, large-scale innovative research that has strong scientific rigor,
transparency, and reproducibility cannot be fully actualized without an efficient state-of-the-art research
infrastructure."
10845595,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Transgenic Mouse Genome Editing Core)
The Transgenic Mouse Genome Editing Core (TMGEC) has been an integral part of the Diabetes Research
Center (DRC) at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania since 1997. The TMGEC is
directed by Dr. Douglas Epstein, PhD, Professor and Vice Chair, Department of Genetics. Dr. Epstein is an
experienced investigator with considerable expertise in technologies and experimental approaches that center
on mouse models of disease, developmental genetics, and genome editing. An experienced technical team,
led by Dr. Jean Richa, provides expertise in a full range of transgenic technologies, enabling the TMGEC to
regularly introduce new and improved services. Services provided by the TMGEC include the generation of
genetically altered mice by direct genome editing (CRISPR/Cas9), DNA microinjection into fertilized oocytes to
create transgenic lines, the generation of chimeric mice via embryonic stem cell injection into blastocysts. The
TMGEC also carries out embryo re-derivation, embryo and sperm cryopreservation, in vitro fertilization (IVF),
and centralized cryopreservation storage. The TMGEC uses state-of-the-art laser conditioning of the zona to
facilitate IVF and has intracytoplasmic sperm injection capability to complement IVF services. Newly developed
services during the current funding period include the major expansion of cryopreservation services with
corresponding expansion of the cryopreservation facility, integration of CRISPR/Cas9 direct genome
modifications with a newly established Perelman School of Medicine CRISPR core, and electroporation of DNA
and RNA into embryos to increase throughput and decrease wait time for TMGEC services. In the past 5
years, 48 DRC investigators used TMGEC services to generate 225 independent mouse lines (primarily by
CRISPR/Cas9 editing) and to store 134 mouse lines (by cryopreservation). Usage is expected to stay the
same, or increase over the next five years. Additional Institutional (non-DRC) support is provided for equipment
maintenance and facility infrastructure upgrades and maintenance. An extensive network of collaborations
exist within the DRC focusing on the use of genetically modified mouse models of diabetes, obesity and
metabolic disorders. These joint projects among DRC investigators highlight the role of the TMGEC not only as
an essential technical resource but also as a key hub for collaborative research among DRC investigators, as
exemplified by the numerous joint publications and successful grant applications arising from mice generated,
stored, and/or re-derived by the TMGEC."

The DRC Regional Metabolomics and Fluxomics Core at Princeton provides Penn DRC investigators with
access to state-of-the-art metabolomics and flux analysis. These capabilities allow DRC investigators to
measure, both broadly and quantitatively, metabolic activity in cell culture, animal model, and clinical
specimens relevant to diabetes and obesity. Usage is high, at about 5000 samples annually. Scientific impact
has also been high, with 34 DRC publications as a Primary Core, including Cell, Science, Nature x 2, Journal
of Clinical Investigation x 2, Nature Metabolism x 3, and Cell Metabolism x 7. This impact reflects the
intellectual synergies between the Core’s expertise in quantitative metabolomics and isotope tracing and DRC
member expertise in diabetes and obesity. In the coming five years, the Core will continue to provide world-class
Metabolomics and Lipodomics measurements with and without isotope labeling. It will also continue to assist
Users with experimental design and data interpretation and to advance methods to meet User needs. In addition,
the Core will introduce new capacity in Spatial Metabolomics and Fluxomics based on MALDI imaging mass
spectrometry. The goal is to enable Users to make measurements of key diabetes-relevant metabolites and
fluxes in tissue slices with single-cell spatial resolution. Access to these capabilities will both accelerate and
expand the horizons of DRC science, leading to improved diagnosis and treatment of diabetes, obesity, and
related disorders."

The mission of the Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) Program of the Penn DRC is to foster the development of new
investigators and to provide seed support for innovative high-risk diabetes related projects, with an increasing
emphasis on clinical and translational science. Over the past 2 funding periods (10 years), the Pilot and
Feasibility Program has been highly successful in this regard. 36 investigators received P&F awards and, of
these, 80% have garnered independent NIH support, the majority as R01s directly related to their P&F awards.
During the previous funding period 23 traditional P&F grants were awarded among 74 applications submitted by
investigators representing 11 Departments spanning multiple Schools and Institutes on the campus of the
University of Pennsylvania as well as other Philadelphia Institutions. Of the funded grants, 70% were to new
investigators and 22% were dedicated to clinical and translational projects. During the next funding period we
propose to continue this core mission of the Pilot and Feasibility Program while also increasing our efforts to
support underrepresented minority investigators and trainees engaged in diabetes research. Given the past
successes of the program, the increasing cost of performing research in the setting of an ever more competitive
funding environment, and the clear need based on the steady influx of applications, it is critical to continue the
mission of the P&F Program."
10839207,"Summary
 Since the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) the survival and quality of life of people
with HIV (PWH) in the Western world has continued to improve. However, HIV infection and ART are
associated with metabolic dysregulations, dyslipidemia, obesity, and increased prevalence of metabolic
syndrome. Cardiovascular disease is becoming a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in PWH.
 Here, we propose an innovative approach to identify and characterize highly selective chemical probes to
a validated therapeutic target dysregulated in HIV and chronic inflammation that has so far proved difficult to
modulate selectively. To this end, using an orchestrated effort from the applicant laboratories, The Herbert
Wertheim UF Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation & Technology (UF Scripps) in Jupiter, FL and Scripps
Research in La Jolla, California, we will carry out a high-throughput screening (HTS) campaign in a 1536-well
plate format in conjunction with a tiered approach to screen the ~666K UF Scripps Drug Discovery Library (UF-
SDDL), which is enriched in compounds of drug likeness and chemical diversity, and the majority with high
Central Nervous System Multiparameter Optimization (CNS MPO) scores. Hit-validation will be performed to
identify small molecule regulators and eliminate nonspecific effectors, using parallel and orthogonal assays as
well as off-target assessments using multiple counterscreens. To prioritize hit scaffold series, we will select
analogs of confirmed hits from compound libraries and commercial sources. Hit scaffolds will be triaged to
remove intractable molecules. We will select 3-5 scaffolds from the most promising hits, which will be profiled
to verify their selectivity, potency, and lack of cytotoxicity. Leads in 2-4 series will be formulated and retested
for potency/selectivity with the aim of advancing leads that can elicit the appropriate in vitro response in the
aforementioned assays. This will be followed by in vivo pharmacokinetics (PK) studies to identify 1-2 top
scaffolds for further investigation. Finally, the most promising 2-3 compounds with favorable drug metabolism
and pharmacokinetics (DMPK) properties including high oral bioavailability, will be selected for in vivo efficacy
testing.
 Altogether, we propose a novel strategy to establish new and more effective therapies to ameliorate HIV-
associated metabolic complications, which is an important unmet clinical need and an area of high priority
HIV/AIDS research within the mission of the NIDDK."

The purpose of this epidemiologic study is to determine if sensory changes (hearing, vision, olfaction) and an
emerging biomarker of aging (PhenoAge) measured in midlife are strong predictors of long-term risk for early
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), and to study the shared etiology of co-occurring sensory
and cognitive changes. Subjects are previous participants in a prospective longitudinal cohort study, the
Beaver Dam Offspring Study (BOSS) and were 21-84 years of age at the baseline examination (2005-2008).
The proposed study (BOSS–Neurocognitive Aging Study) will apply standardized protocols used in the BOSS
baseline, 5-year and 10-year follow-up examinations including a hearing evaluation (otoscopy, audiometry and
word recognition in quiet and in competing message), eye examination (refraction, visual acuity and contrast
sensitivity) and olfaction testing (San Diego Odor Identification Test) and conduct an extended cognitive test
battery (Trail Making Test, Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Verbal Fluency Test, Digit Symbol Substitution Test,
Digit Span, Stroop Test, Mini-Mental State Examination). We will further enhance the evaluation of early ADRD
status by incorporating medical records, caregiver interviews and blood-based biomarkers of AD and
neurodegeneration (amyloid b40, amyloid b42, total Tau and phosphorylated Tau) in a clinical review that will
be conducted by a multidisciplinary neurocognitive expert panel in a diagnosis consensus conference.
Cardiovascular risk factors will be assessed and standardized questionnaires on medical history, medication
usage and lifestyle and environmental factors will be completed. We will measure longitudinal changes in
PhenoAge using new and stored baseline blood samples. The proposed epidemiological study will provide
important information about early biomarkers for the risk of developing cognitive decline and early ADRD and
will inform about relationships between changes in sensory and cognitive function. This will contribute to
developing clinically useful methods to identify high-risk people in midlife and to understanding the shared
etiologies of sensory and cognitive changes. This project’s results will inform about potential pathways for
prevention of ADRD and the promotion of healthy brain aging."
10850913,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States and growing cause of chronic disease globally. At present the treatment options for COPD are limited and new therapies are needed to treat/prevent progression of COPD. Environmental factors and host response leading to imbalance in the ratio of oxidants to antioxidants, and proteases to antiproteases leading to chronic inflammation and tissue destruction is thought to play crucial role in development and progression of COPD.
Quercetin is a plant flavonoid and has potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Quercetin supplementation decreased markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in the plasma of patients with another chronic lung disease, pulmonary sarcoidosis. Quercetin also decreased both oxidative stress and lung inflammation in a preclinical model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However the impact of quercetin in altering biological signatures in COPD subjects is yet to be determined.
The proposed study is conducted in two phases, R61/R33 to define and confirm the biological effects of quercetin in COPD, bioavailability, safety, identification of the appropriate biological signatures which reflect clinical outcomes in COPD. This study will also define the optimal dose of quercetin required for altering biological signatures favorably. This information is necessary to conduct the future clinical trials with quercetin in COPD patients.
In R61 Phase, there will be 15 study participants with moderate COPD with FEV1 ranging between 45 and 70 % of predicted and they will be randomized to receive either placebo or quercetin 2000 mg/day for 6 months. In R33 phase there will be 35 COPD subjects, who will be randomized to receive placebo, or one of the 3 quercetin doses, 500, 1000 or 2000 mg/day.
Outcome of R61 phase will determine the feasibility of R33 Phase.  In both R61 and R33 phases, all subjects will be characterized using a validated symptom questionnaire, medication and smoking histories, analysis of co-morbidities, and physical examination. All subjects will be asked to go on a low quercetin diet 7 days prior to start of quercetin or placebo supplementation to until the end of trial. Blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) will be collected after 7 days washout period (run-in) and after study drug treatment. Blood will also be collected at 3 months of study drug treatment. Plasma and BAL quercetin levels, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in blood and BAL will be measured. Pulmonary function, and blood profiles (CBC and CMP) will be performed at run-in and at 3 and 6 months of study drug treatment to assess the safety. Results from these studies will provide information on biological endpoints, safety, bioavailability, and quercetin dosage required to carry out large clinical trials examining the efficacy of quercetin in COPD patients."
10851038,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 It is now clear that the mammalian retina has at least one other photoreceptor class besides rods and
cones, consisting of a subpopulation of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that express the pigment melanopsin
(OPN4) and are intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs). These cells project predominantly to non-image-vision
centers in the brain, serving functions such as circadian photoentrainment and pupillary light reflex. At the
same time, ipRGCs project moderately to the brain's image-vision centers, presumably serving subtle image-
forming visual functions such as possibly providing information about absolute light intensity in the visual
scene. IpRGCs are known so far to comprise 6 subtypes, M1-M6, which differ in the level of melanopsin
content, photosensitivity, somatic and dendritic-field size, exact locations of their dendritic arborizations in the
retina's inner plexiform layer, and the detailed locations of their axonal projections in the respective brain
targets.
 To fully understand the ipRGC system, it is important to know their light-response properties and the
underlying mechanisms. In recent years, we have made great progress in understanding M1-ipRGCs,
including the molecular identities of several key components in phototransduction such as Gαq-subfamily
members, the PLCβ4 enzyme and the TRPC6,7 channels. These components closely resemble those found in
fly-eye phototransduction. Most recently, we have made the exciting discovery of yet another
phototransduction pathway, found in M2- and M4-ipRGCs. This pathway involves a light-induced elevation of
cyclic nucleotide, which opens HCN channels (channels gated by membrane hyperpolarization and cyclic
nucleotide) to produce membrane depolarization and action potentials.
 This application constitutes a continuation of these successful investigations. Aim 1 is to seek some
details of the HCN-phototransduction pathway still outstanding, including establishing (i) whether cGMP or
cAMP is the second messenger, (ii) the identity of the effector enzyme that controls the second messenger,
and (iii) the identity of the G protein upstream of the HCN-pathway. Aim 2 is to characterize the
phototransduction mechanism(s) still unknown in M3-, M5- and M6-ipRGCs. Our speculation is that the same
two pathways are involved, but this requires verification. Aim 3 is to quantify the relative importance of the two
signaling pathways in different cell subtypes. We shall study sensitivity, intensity-response relation, single-
photon response, and response kinetics of each pathway, hopefully eventually to derive correlations with the
respective subtype's macroscopic functions."
10850791,"Abstract
The number of people suffering from age-related cognitive decline is growing at an unprecedented rate as the
human lifespan increases. In addition, exposure to social adversity and other stressors increases risk for
cognitive deficits which may be exacerbated in aging. Because women are at greater risk for developing
cognitive impairment compared to men, a potential role for estradiol is implicated. However, findings from
studies assessing the effects of estradiol on cognition are equivocal. Consequently, there is a need to
understand whether adverse experiential factors may impact estradiol efficacy that would account for the
variance in the effects of estradiol on cognitive aging in females. One mechanism by which stress exposure
and estradiol both impact cognition and memory is modulation of neuro-inflammatory processes that alter
neurotransmitter release and synthesis and are associated with unhealthy aging. Despite observations that
chronic stress exposure increases vulnerability to cognitive decline, it is not clear whether stress induced
alterations in estradiol’s efficacy in modulating neuroinflammation and cognitive behavior. To fill this gap in
knowledge, the proposed studies will leverage a well characterized non-human primate model of psychosocial
stress to test the overarching hypothesis that low social status produces cognitive deficits in female rhesus
monkeys and neuroinflammation in the brain that are exacerbated by estradiol. Using social group
rearrangements and estradiol manipulations, we will test the effects of social status and age on
neuroinflammation by using PET neuroimaging to site-specifically quantify microglial activation in the brain, as
well as measure concentrations of pro-inflammatory signals in cerebral spinal fluid. We will also determine the
effects of chronic social status and age on cognitive flexibility and memory capacity, and determine the extent
to which neuroinflammation account for variance in executive function assessed. Finally, we will determine the
causal effects of social status on estradiol’s ability to modulate neuroinflammation and cognition. At its
conclusion, the proposed studies will extend upon our previous work by following the same individuals across
experimentally determined changes in their social status to generate insight into both the causal effects of
social status on estradiol’s ability to influence cognitive behavior and brain region-specific markers of
neuroinflammation and their plasticity with changes in the social environment. By assessing and integrating the
physiological, neurobiological, and behavioral data collected as part of the proposed studies, we will be able to
identify a novel mechanism underlying risk for aging-related health disparities in the female brain."

Worldwide, five million adolescents and young adults (AYA) are living with HIV. More than 90% of global HIV-
related mortality among AYA occurs in sub-Saharan Africa. A limited but growing evidence base of interventions
available for adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa highlight the importance of retention in care for improving
treatment outcomes. To meet AYA where they are in their engagement with the healthcare system, interventions
need to be feasible, acceptable, and appropriate for local healthcare settings and practice. This F31 project
leverages a cluster randomized controlled trial, Data-informed Stepped Care to Improve Adolescent HIV
Outcomes (UG3/UH3 HD096906; PIs: Kohler, John-Stewart) that is testing a Stepped Care intervention to
improve retention among adolescents and young adults living with HIV in western Kenya. This F31 project aims
to evaluate early phase implementation outcomes of the Stepped Care intervention as it is delivered across 10
healthcare facilities. Aim 1 will identify adaptations made to the intervention (materials, procedures, or delivery)
that influence acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness. The Framework for Reporting Adaptations and
Modifications to Evidence-based interventions (FRAME) will be used to characterize adaptations and
modifications necessary for facility-specific optimization of the intervention. Aim 2 will identify the barriers and
facilitators that impact penetration, coverage, and fidelity of the Stepped Care intervention. We will apply the
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to examine barriers and facilitators of
implementation to understand the context and intervention characteristics influencing implementation of the
Stepped Care intervention. Finally, Aim 3 will match barriers to successful implementation to targeted strategies
to overcome them, producing a package of intervention implementation options that promote long-term
intervention adoption and sustainability. Findings from this project will contribute to understanding optimization
of Stepped Care and provide valuable information about the context necessary for successful scale-up of
Stepped Care interventions for adolescents and young adults within Kenya or scale out to other global settings.
The research plan will provide the F31 candidate, an implementation science pre-doctoral student, with rigorous
training in (1) implementation science conceptual frameworks, models, design and methodology; (2) training in
qualitative methods; and (3) content-area expertise regarding evidence-based interventions for adolescents and
young adults living with HIV."

We propose a high impact collaborative project to overcome barriers to understanding the roles and regulation
of Forkhead box subfamily O transcription factors FOXO -1, -3, and -4 (FOXO) in stem cell contexts. Stem cells
repopulate the lining of the intestinal tract, muscle, and blood lineages, yet also drive devastating diseases such
as cancer. Evolutionarily conserved, partially redundant FOXO transcription factors are needed for stem cell
maintenance in a litany of contexts such as embryonic, cancer, mesenchymal, hematopoietic, and neural cell
lineages, as well as direct specification of subsequent lineages in a context-dependent manner. Canonically,
high PI3K output leads to cytoplasmic/inactive FOXO factors. Stem cells, however, are fundamentally rewired to
have both high PI3K Pathway activity and nuclear/active FOXO factors. Prior work shows that FOXO factors
directly bind to and activate stem genes in both embryonic stem cells and the poor prognosis cancer glioblastoma
multiforme (GBM) to drive stem cell fate. However, the precise mechanisms utilized by FOXO transcription
factors in driving stemness, hindering differentiation, and determining cell fate are incompletely understood. Our
novel, preliminary insights indicate that nuclear-localized FOXOs engage both the NOTCH and JAK/STAT
signaling pathways. Our preliminary evidence demonstrates a strong loss in the gene expression of NOTCH
Pathway components NOTCH1 and NOTCH3, as well as their targets including HES1, in FOXO4 loss-of-function
contexts. Our preliminary data indicates that FOXO factors share the ability to promote NOTCH output.
Motivated by our preliminary findings and published work (by others), we propose to examine whether FOXO -
1, -3, and -4 redundantly drive NOTCH1 and NOTCH3 gene expression in GBM and myoblasts. Our preliminary
work with FOXO transcription factor disruption mutants shows that FOXO4 acts uniquely to hinder JAK/STAT3
activation and expression of targets IGF1, PDGF and TH. Of note, FOXO3 disruption led to a loss in STAT3
activation, underscoring unique contributions of FOXO factors to the JAK/STAT Pathway. We propose to dissect
the ability of FOXO factors to differentially regulate the JAK/STAT Pathway in GBM and myoblast settings. Our
long-term goal is to delineate FOXO-driven fundamental biological processes that aid in stem cell maintenance
and cell fate by promoting the NOTCH Pathway and differentially regulating the JAK/STAT Pathway. The
proposed work will integrally involve student researchers (our group has successfully sent eleven students to
doctoral studies) and will promote the research environment at UTRGV, the second-largest Hispanic serving
institution in the United States."

 Systemic inﬂammation and mortality in people living with HIV (PLWH) are associated with mucosal
immune dysfunction and persistent viral reservoirs in the mucosa and lymphoid tissues. In the previous
project period, we have demonstrated the role of CD4+ FOXP3+regulatory T cells (Treg) dysregulation in
contributing to aging- and HIV-associated oral inﬂammation. The dysfunctional Tregs that we uncovered in the
oral mucosa of PLWH mimic tissue-resident CD4+ T cells expressing high levels of PD-1 and amphiregulin
(AREG). These cells correlate with CD38+HLADR+ CD4+T cell hyperactivation and dysfunction, toll-like
receptor 2 (TLR-2), and inﬂammasome/IL-1β signaling in vivo, and require IL-1β/AKT pathways for their
expansion in the context of HIV infection. Here we propose to address the role of oral fungal dysbiosis in
establishing the inﬂammatory environment and triggering oral immune cells to become dysfunctional. Building
on our more recent results from salivary metabolome analysis in PLWH, we will examine the underlying
pathways at the interface of dectin-1, AREG, inﬂammasome, and immunometabolism signaling pathways in
three well-connected aims. Thus, our proposal will reveal new directions to manage oral immune-dysfunction
and thereby systemic inﬂammation, and alter current clinical practice."

In the 21st century, advances in knowledge, research technologies, and analytical tools have created
unprecedented opportunities for major breakthroughs in our understanding of fundamental biological principles
and their underlying mechanisms. We propose here a new interdisciplinary program in Molecular, Cellular, and

in science infrastructure, education, and training. Our goal is to educate a diverse, rigorous, and independent
group of scientists who will identify novel essential questions in mechanistic biology and develop incisive tools
for addressing them. Based on our successful predecessor T32 program, we plan to recruit a group of 20 trainees
per year beginning in their second year of graduate study from the Biological and Biomedical Sciences umbrella
program. These 20 trainees will distribute across a group of 80 MCDM preceptor laboratories. Our approach to
cultivating a resilient and creative group of scholars will be both evidence-based and student-centered. We will
bring innovative programming to an exceptionally talented pool of trainees. Through continuous improvements
in mentorship practice, community engagement and inclusion, we will foster a collaborative community of

10853820,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The APOBEC3 (A3) family of proteins are cellular cytidine deaminases that suppress human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection by hypermutation of viral reverse transcripts and physically
blocking reverse transcription. To evade this host defense mechanism, HIV-1 expresses the virion infectivity
factor (Vif), which hijacks a cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and targets A3 proteins (A3F/G/H/D) for
proteasome-mediated degradation. Besides degrading A3s, HIV-1 Vif also causes G2 cell cycle arrest by
targeting multiple protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) regulators (PPP2R5 proteins) for degradation. Adding to the
complexity of Vif-host protein interactions, HIV-1 Vif utilizes the transcription factor CBFβ as a non-canonical
cofactor, while maedi-visna virus (MVV) Vif co-opts the prolyl isomerase cyclophilin A (CypA) instead. Our goal
is to establish the biochemical and structural principles for the multifaceted activities of lentiviral Vif molecules
that recruit cellular factors to degrade host proteins via ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. To achieve our goal,
we will use a combination of biochemical, biophysical, structural biology, and cellular functional techniques. To
establish the mechanisms by which A3 proteins are targeted by the HIV-1 Vif (Aim1), we will determine high-
resolution structures of the A3-Vif-E3 interaction complexes, validate these structures by structure-guided
mutagenesis experiments in vitro and in vivo, and interrogate the molecular determinants of Vif/A3/E3 ligase
assembly and activation. In addition, we will also study the degradation-independent mode of Vif inhibition of
A3 deamination and antiviral activities. To better understand CypA-mediated formation of MVV Vif-E3 ubiquitin
ligase (Aim2), we will assemble MVV Vif/CypA/E3 ligase complexes with or without A3 substrates, determine
their high-resolution structures, and perform biochemical and functional validations of our structural
observations. The influences of capsid proteins on the assembly and activation of MVV Vif-E3 ligase will also
be investigated. To delineate the mechanisms of PPP2R5/PP2A recruitment by lentiviral Vif-E3 ubiquitin
ligases (Aim3), we will investigate the effects of PPP2R5 proteins on the assemblies of the CBFβ-mediated
HIV-1 Vif and CypA-mediated MVV Vif-E3 ligases, obtain high-resolution structures, and perform structure-
guided validations. Our comprehensive research design provides a robust approach that will generate
unprecedented insights into the diverse functions of lentiviral Vif molecules."

and impose large personal and societal burdens. The repair, regeneration, or rejuvenation of musculoskeletal
tissues and joints requires knowledge of complex and interconnected biomechanical, biological, and
physiological processes. This program aims to train future biologists, engineers, physicians, and surgeons to
solve orthopedic and musculoskeletal problems by providing outstanding research and educational opportunities
within the setting of a state-of-the-art medical and research center. Forty faculty members, who are leaders in
basic, translational, and clinical research of orthopedics and the musculoskeletal system, will mentor trainees by
directing research projects and group discussions on timely topics. Peer-mentors provide new trainees with
opportunities to receive advice and counseling from past trainees who successfully obtained independent
fellowships. All trainees will receive training in the responsible conduct of research, data management, and in
scientific rigor and reproducibility. Postdoctoral fellows (5 per year) and graduate students (2 per year) will
engage in multiyear projects and receive training in grant writing and career development. They will be expected
to submit applications for independent fellowships and to participate in a full array of programmatic activities,
including but not limited to journal clubs, seminars, symposia, webinars, and scientific meetings. Medical
students (2 per year) from fully accredited medical schools in the United States and her territories (i.e., Puerto
Rico) will spend two to three months in the training program and are expected to complete a mentored research
project and participate in programmatic educational activities. This blended musculoskeletal research training
program values individuals from diverse educational and societal backgrounds. Our community benefits from
the unique perspectives they bring to solving complex medical problems, identifying social determinants of
musculoskeletal disease, and reducing the burden of musculoskeletal conditions on patients, their families, and
our society."

This proposal is a competitive renewal application for five years of support to continue the 45-year-old Yale
Postdoctoral Training Program in Investigative Hepatology. The goal of this training program is to provide basic
laboratory, translational, or clinical research training for physicians who have completed clinical training in
gastroenterology in preparation for careers as independent investigators in academic hepatology and to provide
research training for recent PhD graduates to prepare them for careers as independent investigators in basic
liver-related research. The program draws on the exceptional liver research environment at Yale, including a
large pool of preceptors who are internationally recognized investigators that are well funded and have extensive
mentorship experience. The program’s trainees in turn have a long track record of going on to become leaders
in the field of hepatology; in recent years most trainees have obtained independent funding, and nearly all have
published multiple papers related to their training and have gone on to academic or other research-intensive
careers. The program will continue to train four postdoctoral fellows at a time, and individual trainees will be
supported for two to three years. Selection of trainees will be based on strong prior research experience and
commitment to liver-related research. This training program will use the combined resources of the NIDDK-
funded Yale Liver Center, the Yale Digestive Diseases Section, and facilities of the participating faculty including
the Departments of Internal Medicine, Cell Biology, Cellular and Molecular Physiology, Human Genetics,
Immunobiology, and Pharmacology. The major research areas represented include (1) liver immunobiology and
inflammation, (2) hepatic metabolism, and (3) epithelial biology and pathobiology. The Section of Digestive
Diseases, the Medical School's Investigative Medicine Program as well as enrichment programs provided by the
Liver Center together provide a strong and liver-oriented educational curriculum. Trainees are encouraged to
audit or enroll in specific courses in the School of Medicine or the School of Public Health, attend annual
laboratory and lecture courses designed for physician trainees in the Department of Medicine, and are required
to attend both Hepatology and Basic Science Journal Clubs, plus weekly research and pathophysiology
seminars. Progress is monitored through several mechanisms including ""Research in Progress"" seminars and
individual Progress Committees."

Dyspnea is one of the most common and distressing symptoms associated with cancer, occurring in nearly 70%
of patients with advanced cancer. Dyspnea is associated with impaired function, decreased quality of life, and
shortened survival. Previous trials suggest that existing palliative interventions, such as low flow supplemental
oxygen and opioids, have limited efficacy. Due to the paucity of high-quality evidence, there are currently no U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment options. Multiple organizations, including the Institute
of Medicine and National Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association, identified dyspnea as a priority for research.
 The long-term goal of our research is to develop evidence-based therapies for the palliation of dyspnea in
patients with cancer. The overall objective of our proposed high risk, high impact, two-arm, parallel-group, wait-
list control, randomized clinical trial is to compare the efficacy of a respiratory therapist (RT)-led Structured
Personalized Oxygen and support Therapies for dyspnea in ONcology patients (SPOT-ON) intervention with
enhanced usual care on dyspnea. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that a personalized RT-led
intervention incorporating time-limited trials of oxygen and support therapies would be effective in reducing
dyspnea in acutely ill hospitalized patients with cancer. The two primary specific aims of this study are to compare
the effect of SPOT-ON and enhanced usual care on the change in intensity of dyspnea at 24 h in hospitalized
cancer patients with hypoxemia (Primary Aim 1) and without hypoxemia (Primary Aim 2). The third aim is to
compare the effect of SPOT-ON and enhanced usual care on patient outcomes over 72 h, including dyspnea
intensity, dyspnea unpleasantness, dyspnea response, vital signs, symptom burden, health-related quality of
life, adverse events, pattern of device use, and hospital outcomes. The fourth aim is to assess factors associated
with efficacy of the SPOT-ON intervention, including patient demographics, preferences, and level of usage of
oxygen delivery modalities. After obtaining informed consent, a RT will administer the structured study
interventions and monitor the participants closely for 72 hours.
 This study is highly innovative because (1) it will be the first clinical trial to specifically examine a RT-led
intervention for palliation of dyspnea; (2) it will examine how time-limited trials can be used to personalize
dyspnea management; (3) it will provide treatment based on patient preference instead of physician prescription;
(4) it will test the effect of various oxygen modalities in patients without hypoxemia; (5) it adopts personalized
dyspnea goal as a novel response criteria; and (6) it employs an innovative personalized trial design. Successful
completion of this definitive study is expected to identify the optimal strategy to reduce dyspnea with oxygen-
based and support therapies. Results of this study are expected to enhance quality of life for patients with
advanced cancer, transform the management of dyspnea, and shift the paradigm of symptom research.

10852072,"The thymus is the primary site of T lymphocyte development, where mutually inductive signaling between
lymphoid progenitors and thymic epithelial cells (TECs) directs the progenitors along a well-characterized
program of differentiation. However, the thymus atrophies with age, resulting in waning T cell immunity.
Regeneration of the aged thymus can be achieved experimentally, but the underlying mechanisms are not well
understood. Therefore durable, clinically relevant approaches for thymic regeneration have not yet been
identified. Prior work has established that cortical TECs (cTECs) are the primary targets of atrophy and
regeneration, but many aspects of their basic biology have been difficult to resolve because they represent a
small fraction of thymus cellularity, and because their isolation requires enzymatic digestion that induces broad
physiological changes. We recently found that cTECs have a unique labyrinth-like morphology, which is
dynamically regulated during thymus atrophy and regeneration. Emerging evidence suggests that paracrine
FGF21 signals mediated by mTOR are critical regulators of cTEC size, morphology, and metabolic processes,
particularly autophagy, which is required for self-antigen presentation and T cell selection. FGF21, mTOR, and
autophagy can each by manipulated by available therapeutics, with potential to regenerate the atrophied thymus.
The proposed study aims to combine existing genetic models and advanced imaging analysis to independently
manipulate FGF21, mTOR and autophagy pathways and identify their regulatory relationships and roles in
controlling cTECs size and morphology, as well as their effects on overall thymus size and function. These
studies will inform the design of an optimal combination therapeutic strategy for thymus regeneration in aged
animals, which will be evaluated for its capacity to improve T cell responses to viral challenge."

Drug addiction, including cocaine-abuse disorder, represents a major public health issue, characterized by
compulsive drug seeking and increased propensity to relapse after abstinence. Relapse to cocaine seeking is
triggered by environmental cues strongly associated with the rewarding effects of the drug itself. The neuronal
encoding of cocaine-associated cues at a single-cell level remains unclear, limiting our understanding of how
cocaine-paired cues trigger drug seeking behavior. Via its constituent dopamine D1- and D2- receptor expressing
medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs), the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore) plays a key role in encoding
cue-reward associations and triggering relapse to cocaine seeking behavior. The NAcore integrates multiple
cortical and allocortical inputs. In particular, the activation of afferent glutamatergic projections from the prelimbic
cortex (PL) are necessary for cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Using chemogenetic and
optogenetic manipulations on D1- and D2-MSNs, previous studies have shown opposite roles of these neuronal
subtypes on cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking in rodent models of self-administration. Therefore, I
hypothesize that cocaine seeking during context/cue-reinstatement and refraining from seeking during extinction
training are associated with temporally and spatially distinct neuronal ensembles of D1- and D2-MSNs that are
differentially modulated by PL-NAcore projections. I will address this hypothesis by quantifying Ca2+ activity in
D1-MSNs (Aim 1) and D2-MSNs (Aim 2) during cocaine-seeking and extinction, with and without inhibiting PL-
efferents to NAcore. To investigate the functional role of D1- and D2-MSNs during cocaine seeking, we will
record single-cell Ca2+ dynamics from D1- and D2-MSNs using a head-mounted miniature microscope and virally
expressed Cre-dependent Ca2+ indicator (GCaMP6f) in D1- and D2-cre transgenic mice while undergoing
cocaine self-administration, extinction training and cue-induced reinstatement, We will further inhibit PL-NAcore
projections during drug seeking tests (post abstinence and during cue-induced reinstatement) using virally
expressed inhibitory Gi-DREADDs. Recorded Ca2+ dynamics will be analyzed using advanced statistical models
and clustered to isolate the neuronal ensembles associated with context/cue-induced drug seeking and refraining
from seeking during extinction. The information obtained from this research will isolate neuronal ensembles that
encode cocaine-seeking, as well as the mechanism(s) by which PL-NAcore projections affect these ensembles
to regulate cue-induced reinstatement. This fellowship will train me in experimental design, scientific writing, and
cutting-edge techniques to understand the brain circuits underlying drug addiction, including viral transfection
and micro-endoscopic analysis of Ca2+ activity in transgenic mice trained to self-administer and reinstate to drug-
associated cues and contexts."

Tissue engineering provides a strategy for developing improved prosthetic biomaterials for use in congenital
heart surgery. The overriding premise of our work is that tissue engineering can be used to regenerate
autologous neotissue to repair or replace cardiovascular tissues that are congenitally malformed and that the
tissue engineered constructs will perform better than prosthetic biomaterials. We developed a tissue engineered
vascular graft (TEVG) specifically for use in congenital heart surgery and are currently performing a clinical trial
evaluating its safety as an extracardiac conduit in the Fontan operation in which a vascular graft is used to
connect the inferior vena cava (IVC) to the pulmonary artery. The broad, long term objective of this study is to
translate this technology to the clinic for use in children with congenital heart disease. In order to obtain FDA
approval, we must demonstrate the efficacy of the TEVG in a relevant preclinical animal model. The goal of this
proposal is to evaluate the late term efficacy of TEVGs compared to PTFE grafts (the current clinical standard
of care) using the ovine IVC vascular interposition graft model which we previously developed and validated for
this purpose. To this end we propose three specific aims: In the first aim we will evaluate the physiological
properties of the TEVG implanted in the ovine model between 9-10 years including compliance and
vasoreactivity in addition to growth capacity. We will use intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and invasive pressure
monitoring to measure and compare the compliance of the TEVG and native IVC in age- and sex-matched sheep
at various loading conditions. Next we will also use the IVUS and invasive pressure monitoring coupled with
pharmacological testing to evaluate and compare the response of the TEVG and the native IVC to various
pharmacological reagents at physiologically relevant doses. Finally, we will measure the change in size and
geometry of the TEVG using serial 3D angiography to rule out aneurismal dilation and determine the functional
growth capacity of the TEVG over the natural life span of the animals in our study. In our second aim we will use
computed tomography to evaluate and compare the degree of ectopic calcification between TEVGs and PTFE
grafts implanted in the ovine model. In the third aim we will evaluate and compare the hemodynamic performance
of TEVGs to PTFE grafts implanted in the ovine model using 4D MRI and invasive hemodynamic monitoring.
We will evaluate graft performance both at rest and during simulated stress using dobutamine stress testing then
use the 4D flow and invasive hemodynamic pressure data to analyze the degree of disordered flow and
associated energy loss within the grafts over cardiac and respiratory cycles at different hemodynamic states
using computational fluid dynamics. The development of an improved TEVG with growth capacity has the
potential to improve outcomes for children born with congenital heart disease."

10851330,"Microbiome impacts cancer development and therapeutic efficacy. In addition to the guts, microbes reside in
different tissues influencing the pathophysiology of the tissue microenvironment. These tissue-resident
microbes are largely attributed to translocation of gut microbes. In the breast, such passage is termed ‘gut-
breast axis’, helping establish microbiotas of breast tissue and milk. Nevertheless, gut-breast axis has been
mostly conceptualized around pregnancy, and it is completely unknown whether this axis indeed exists outside
pregnancy to impact breast health and carcinogenesis. Our long-term goal is to dissect how microbiome
contributes to breast pathophysiology. Especially, the objectives of the present study are to determine i)
whether gut-breast axis occurs on a regular basis; ii) whether this involves discrete sets of bacteria for healthy
cohorts vs. cancer patients, and iii) what are their roles. Our central hypothesis is that gut-breast axis takes
place on a regular basis, involving distinct sets of bacteria to confer anti-tumor effects on healthy cohorts vs.
pro-tumor effects on cancer patients. The proposed research is based on our preliminary studies allowing us to
harvest specific gut microbiotas from tumor-protected or -susceptible animals. We reported that supplementing
sepiapterin (SEP)—the endogenous precursor of tetrahydrobiopterin (the cofactor of nitric oxide (NO)
synthase)—normalized arginine metabolism and improved the immunogenicity of HER2-positive mammary
tumors. We then orally applied SEP to mice prone to HER2-positive mammary tumors and saw strong tumor
prevention. These mice also showed increases in NO levels and NO-producing bacteria in the guts. Besides,
extracts of these gut bacteria activated innate immune cells, suggesting the roles of these gut bacteria in anti-
tumor immunity. Here, we will determine whether these gut bacteria physically translocate to the breast to exert
tumor preventative effects. Our hypothesis will be tested through two SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) Determine whether
gut microbiotas of a) tumor-protected vs. b) -susceptible mice exert anti-tumor vs, pro-tumor effects; and 2)
determine whether distinct sets of gut microbes are translocated to mammary glands to exert anti-tumor vs.
pro-tumor effects. In Aim 1, we will transplant gut microbiota of a) tumor-protected (SEP-treated) or b) -
susceptible (DMSO-treated) HER2 mice into recipients and give the inverse drug treatments. We will test
whether the transplanted microbiotas antagonize the treatments. In Aim 2, gut microbiota of a) tumor-protected
(SEP) vs b) -susceptible (DMSO) mice are differentially labeled, and the 50:50 mixture is given to the recipients
undergoing SEP or DMSO treatment. Labeled microbes are analyzed for their gut-breast translocation; their
ratios in the breast; and the contributions of breast microbiota to the drug effects. The proposed study is
innovative because this is the first time to corroborate gut-breast axis and its contributions to breast
pathophysiology. The study is significant because it will have a positive translational impact by justifying the
development of a new breast cancer treatment or prevention strategy focused on breast microbiota."

Broad agreement exists that future epidemics will occur, better preparedness is needed for managing surges,
and much should be learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 virus to-date has caused over
46 million infections, 3.25 million hospitalizations, and 745,000 deaths in the U.S. alone, with regional surges of
varied timing, magnitude, and duration profoundly straining healthcare capacity and impacting patient, staff,
and system safety. As with other epidemics, local outbreaks and surges continuously change, often resulting in
crisis management, makeshift rooming, sub-standard personal protection equipment, and rationing of limited
resources. Among other needs, better real-time methods are needed to anticipate hospital, equipment, and
staff capacities and shortages to allow earlier preemptive mitigation (gap).
While analytic models are increasingly used, most are at the more macro policy level rather than facility-spe-
cific operational level (gap), in the latter case with little known about their use in practice, accuracy, decision-
making workflow, adoption, utility, and impact on operations, outcomes, and safety. In our own work, we devel-
oped and widely deployed integrated models that predict facility-specific and unit-specific demand, adapt to
real-time changes in these, and estimate 4-week ahead daily capacity, demand, and shortages (rooms, equip-
ment, staff) within any given facility, downloaded by systems in all 50 states and 91 countries. While use of
systems engineering models is well-accepted in other settings, their use, utility, and impact is significantly un-
der-studied in this important context and healthcare more generally, with potentially important lessons for the
future (gap).
This project thus will take a multi-methods approach to (Aim 1) conduct modeling research to further refine re-
sults to-date, optimize accuracy, and address identified technical needs, (Aim 2) evaluate impacts and accu-
racy of the developed models on improved hospital capacity and safety under a wide range of simulated future
and past surge scenarios, and (Aim 3) maximize future utility by studying how our models were used in prac-
tice during COVID-19, the model adoption process, types of resulting actions, barriers to use, and user percep-
tions of utility, accuracy, and model-based decision-making. The project will be led by an experienced interdis-
ciplinary healthcare modeling team, working closely with varied hospital data sites and an advisory committee
with expertise in patient safety, epidemic response, hospital surges, and modeling. Anticipated results include
(1) validated robust models for preemptively anticipating and responding to care surges, (2) reduced unsafe
hospital crisis management conditions during future epidemics, and (3) improved understanding of how to best
use systems engineering models to address epidemic surges and other important public health and care deliv-
ery problems."

Radiotherapy is used to treat 60% of the cancer patients and 40% of curative cases. However, normal tissue
toxicities still prevent radiotherapy from achieving more effective tumor control in many patients despite decades
of technological development in intensity-modulated radiation therapy and image-guided radiation therapy. Ultra-
high dose rate, a.k.a., FLASH radiotherapy has recently re-emerged as a potential method to significantly
improve the radiation biological dose conformality on top of the physical dose conformality. Although existing X-
ray linac and proton systems can be modified to deliver the FLASH dose rate, they are limited in either field size,
depth penetration, or dose conformality to be useful for treating most human tumors. Conceptual systems such
as very high energy electron and PHASER will need to overcome significant and risky technological barriers to
be clinically practical. In this Academic-Industrial Partnerships project, we propose to develop a high dose rate
X-ray radiotherapy system that is a scale-up of existing technologies for clinical FLASH radiotherapy. There are
three major technical challenges in achieving the FLASH dose rate with X-rays. The first is the linear accelerator
that is capable to produce such a high dose rate. For this challenge, we hypothesize that a 12 MV X-ray
beam >300 Gy/s uncollimated dose rate can be achieved using a combination of already-demonstrated
accelerator technologies. The second challenge is the well-separated beam angles for good X-ray dosimetry.
The third challenge is intensity modulation for conformal dose distribution. The tightly correlated second and third
challenges are due to the slow mechanical movement of the common C-arm gantry and the MLC leaf speed. To
overcome these two challenges, we propose to develop a rotational ring-gantry FLASH IMRT platform with many
quasi-static MLCs. The fast-spinning ring-gantry system would deliver the entire treatment in an arc within a very
short time. The intensity modulation is achieved by using a decoupled MLC ring with a large number of MLC
banks each pre-shaping the aperture for rotational IMRT. The system would then be able to achieve highly
conformal dose distribution comparable to state of the art VMAT, and at the same time take advantage of the
FLASH radiobiology. We propose the following aims: Aim 1. High dose rate linac development; Aim 2.
Development of ROtational direct Aperture optimization with a Decoupled (ROAD) MLC ring; Aim 3.
Demonstration of rotational FLASH using a benchtop system."

 Eukaryotic cells contain within them a myriad of spatially distinct sites that serve a variety of functions.
To facilitate this organization, eukaryotic gene expression is routinely spatially regulated through the trafficking
and sequestration of thousands of different RNA molecules to distinct cellular locations. Misregulation of this
process leads to detrimental phenotypes in a wide range of systems, from developmental defects in Drosophila
to neurological disease in humans.
 Despite this importance, our knowledge of the regulation of RNA localization is quite limited. For other
modes of post-transcriptional regulation like splicing, our understanding of how the interactions of RNA binding
proteins (RBPs) and RNA motifs lead to specific outcomes is much more mature. This relies on many years of
work by many groups that have defined the regulatory language of splicing and allows us to make predictive
and combinatorial models about how splicing is regulated across conditions and cellular environments. We lack
such an ability with regards to RNA localization, in large part because we lack the analogous “parts list” that
defines the language of localization regulation.
 The overall goal of the Taliaferro lab is to learn this language and be able to build predictive models that
explain how RNAs are trafficked to their intracellular destinations. This includes identification of sequences
within RNAs that govern their transport as well as RNA-binding proteins that bind these sequences and
mediate the process. Historically, these features have been identified for one RNA at a time through a time
consuming and laborious process. Although these studies form the foundation of the RNA localization field, the
amount of effort they require has limited their application to a large number of RNAs. Further, it is often hard to
take findings from these single-transcript experiments and generalize them into larger principles that underlie
rules that govern the transport of thousands of RNAs.
 The Taliaferro lab aims to approach this problem from the opposite direction by isolating subcellular
transcriptomes and identifying features shared in common among RNAs localized to a particular destination.
This strategy identifies elements associated with the transport of hundreds of RNAs at once, parallelizing the
one-transcript-at-a-time approaches used in the past. During the course of the proposed experiments, over the
next five years, the Taliaferro lab will use a variety of high-throughput approaches to both discover new
sequence elements that regulate RNA localization as well as deeply characterize previously identified
elements in order to discern how they work. Additionally, we will develop new technologies that will facilitate the
definition of RNA localization mechanisms in organisms and cell types that thus far have been intractable. We
expect that results from these studies will be a positive step toward our goal of understanding and eventually
applying the molecular language of RNA localization regulation."
10843065,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Complex morphogenetic processes are required for proper organismal development. These morphogenetic
processes require various combinations of cell migration, proliferation, invasion, and fate acquisition. The
coordination of these behaviors must be tightly regulated, as dysregulation of these processes can lead to
developmental disorders and disease states such as cancer. To study the regulation of complex
morphogenetic process we turn to zebrafish development. In zebrafish, morphogenesis of midline tissue
structures such as the notochord, floor plate, and hypochord drive axis elongation of the developing embryo.
These tissues are derived from a population of progenitors residing in the tailbud known as midline progenitor
cells (MPCs). MPCs undergo a morphogenetic process called convergent extension (CE) to give rise to the
notochord. During CE, adjacent MPCs migrate and intercalate between one another to form the notochord.
The decision of MPCs to adopt a notochord, floor plate, or hypochord fate is based on local signaling cues
such as Wnt and Notch. While these signaling pathways have been shown to regulate morphogenetic cell
behaviors, there is growing evidence to suggest that the cell cycle can also modulate cell behaviors. However,
the mechanisms by which cell cycle state dictates cell behavior and cell fate during tailbud morphogenesis
remain unclear. I will address this gap in knowledge and elucidate the relationship between cell cycle state and
cell fate/morphogenesis during development using CE of the zebrafish notochord during tailbud
morphogenesis as a model. Published data from my lab and others show notochord progenitor cells are in G1,
while floor plate and hypochord progenitors can be found in all phases of the cell cycle. Furthermore, these
notochord progenitors undergo CE in G1 and reenter the cell cycle after joining the notochord, suggesting that
G1 arrest facilitates this morphogenetic process and notochord fate acquisition. In Aim 1 of this project, I will
perturb G1 arrest specifically in the MPCs and determine the effects on CE. Using transgenic zebrafish lines,
including a CDK activity biosensor to establish cell cycle state, and spinning disk confocal microscopy, I will
time-lapse image these cell cycle perturbed embryos and quantify CE and fate acquisition. In Aim 2, I will
explore the gene regulatory network (GRN) responsible for inducing G1 arrest in the MPCs, with a focus on the
T-box transcription factor Brachyury (tbxta). Published data show tbxta to be indispensable to notochord
formation and moreover, preliminary data from our lab show knockdown of tbxta drives notochord progenitors
to cycle and be excluded from the notochord, adopting a floor plate or hypochord fate. The combination of a
CDK activity biosensor, cell cycle perturbation constructs, midline directed cell transplantation, and spinning
disk confocal microscopy will allow me to test my hypotheses thoroughly and rigorously."

The past two decades have seen major advances in understanding the basic mechanisms of biological aging.
Simultaneously, there has been a rapidly growing appreciation of the importance of these mechanisms in
human health and disease, which has been conceptualized by the term “geroscience”. This term refers to the
research approach that seeks to understand this fundamental relationship between aging and disease. With
the rapid expansion in knowledge and interest in this field, there is a great, unmet need to train the next
generation of scientific leaders at the interface of fundamental mechanisms of biological aging and clinically
relevant age-related disease. This is the underlying, guiding theme of our proposed training program at the
University of Washington. Our mission is to provide cutting-edge Training in Biological Mechanisms of Healthy
Aging. This training program will seek to achieve this goal by providing outstanding trainees at the University
of Washington with (1) rigorous training in cutting edge research focused on biological mechanisms of healthy
aging, (2) exposure to, and the ability to critically evaluate, the breadth of knowledge, concepts, and
approaches important in the field, and (3) the mentoring and skill sets necessary to achieve career success
and become future scientific leaders. The program will support 6 pre- and 6 post-doctoral trainees. Our
training program for both pre-and post-doctorates provides a rich environment in which we build upon the
considerable strengths of our Faculty and our participating Departments and Programs. This includes aging-
related courses, journal club, trainee research presentations, seminar series and support for attendance at
national aging-focused meetings. We provide continuity of training by typically providing support for 3-4 (pre-
doc) or 2-3 (post-doc) years. Predoctoral candidates ordinarily begin near the end of their 2nd year of graduate
training and post-docs in their 1st year of post-graduate training. Trainees from this program will become skilled
and motivated to work to increase the understanding of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the
processes that contribute to the burden of disease in aging, as well as contributing to the discovery of new
interventions to prevent or reverse them."
10843075,"The goal of this research is to make a prototype of a self-powered load sensing system for Total Knee
Replacement (TKR) and show its effectiveness via pre-clinical testing on cadaver knees under simulated
activities of daily living. TKR is the most common surgery, and it is growing in numbers because of the
osteoarthritis epidemic in older people and sports accidents in younger people. During joint replacement
surgeries, prosthesis are aligned to provide appropriate kinematics and stability. Unfortunately, aberrant loading
patterns resulting from implant misalignment or ligament imbalance after surgery can result in early failure.
Tracking the long-term health of the implant is difficult without quantitative joint load data. This is especially true
for telehealth, which have become increasingly common due to restrictions on in-person clinic visits as a result
of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ability to noninvasively measure loads using embedded autonomous sensors
would enable earlier identification of aberrant loading and the development of treatment strategies.
State-of-the-art technologies use electromagnetic or piezoelectric transducers. Electromagnetic devices require
incorporation of a coil and magnets within the prosthesis, which may weaken the structure. Piezoelectric
transducers, on the other hand, are most commonly made of ceramics that contain lead posing obvious health
risks. Lead-free Piezoelectric materials have been made, but they have lower power density, especially
compared to newer energy harvesting technology. Triboelectric energy harvesting is a newly discovered energy
harvesting technique based on contact electrification and electrostatic induction. Triboelectric energy harvesters
convert cyclic motion to electricity by generating charges at micro-patterned textured contacting surfaces. The
wide range of materials that exhibit triboelectric properties allows flexibility in the design of harvesters for low
cost, high sensitivity, high power density and biocompatibility, making them ideal for implant applications.
To take advantage of this promising new technology, we propose a self-powered load monitoring system for
TKR that can be customized and installed between the ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE)
bearing and the tibial tray, allowing the device to be incorporated into any TKR system. The load monitoring
system comprises four harvesters, one in each quadrant of the tibial tray, and a frontend electronics system. The
system can monitor the force distribution across four quadrants over time. This information is essential in health
monitoring of the implant because aberrant load transmission is a leading cause of implant revision surgeries.
The amount of energy harvested is small (~20 microwatts), but is adequate for extracting important features of
the load throughout the day. The data will be gathered on a computer and normal versus abnormal loading
patterns will be classified using artificial neural networks. This creative approach enables the sensor to
continuously operate using solely the power produced by the harvester. The proposed project can revolutionize

This proposal's long-term goal is to take advantage of the biology of the Nr4a family of orphan nuclear hormone
receptors to selectively manipulate antigen-specific B cell responses. If successful, this could transform our
approach to vaccination and treatment of immune-mediated diseases.
Nr4a family members (Nur77, Nurr1, and Nor1) are encoded by three genes (Nr4a1-3, respectively) that are
rapidly induced by antigen (Ag) stimulation in lymphocytes. Although they are thought to function as ligand-
independent, constitutively active transcription factors, small molecule agonist and antagonist ligands have been
developed, rendering them druggable. We have shown that a fluorescent reporter of Nr4a1 expression (Nur77-
eGFP BAC Tg) scales with the intensity of Ag stimulation, and also correlates with self-reactivity in naturally
occurring B cells in healthy mice and in three different BCR Tg models. We have recently shown that Nur77
curbs the survival and expansion of B cells in response to chronic and acute Ag stimulation, imposing a novel
layer of B cell tolerance. Importantly, the Nr4a family harbor considerable structural homology in their DNA-
binding domain and, as a result, exhibit profound functional redundancy in T cells, where they also play an
important regulatory role. Such redundancy is likely highly relevant to their function in B cells (which
predominantly express Nr4a1 and Nr4a3) yet has never been experimentally addressed. This represents a
major gap in our knowledge that limits full therapeutic exploitation of these factors.
Here we report that newly generated mice with B cell-specific deletion of Nr4a1 and Nr4a3 show a major break
in B cell tolerance, including the development of spontaneous germinal centers and autoantibodies. These
defects correlate with profound super-induction of novel target genes in response to Ag stimulation – including
several genes required for recruitment of T cell help – that is largely masked when even one functional Nr4a
allele remains. We therefore hypothesize that the Nr4a family mediates negative feedback downstream of Ag
stimulation via transcriptional repression of key target genes. We propose that this serves two functions: (a) to
restrain self-reactive clones that receive signal 1 (antigen) in the absence of signal 2 (co-stimulation), and (b)
restrain immunodominant clones from monopolizing normal humoral immune responses, in order to preserve
clonal diversity. In this grant, we propose:
(1) To define the role of the Nr4a family in regulating central and peripheral B cell tolerance, and identify
transcriptional mechanisms that mediate these functions in BCR Tg and naturally occurring self-reactive B cells.
(2) To define the role of the Nr4a family in regulating B cell inter-clonal competition and clonal diversity during
the primary T-dependent humoral immune response and its contribution to limiting immunodominance.
(3) To define the role of the newly identified Nr4a target gene Batf in mediating these processes."

10844343,"Background: An effective learning healthcare system needs measures that help managers
identify how to promote system-level improvements. One opportunity to influence system level
improvements is to directly measure the care sequences provided to patients that may reflect
decreased efficiency and increased care fragmentation. We propose to determine whether a VA
administrative data can be used to construct reliable measures of care sequences.
Significance/Impact: Our innovation is in adapting a data science sequence analysis
methodology to VA administrative records. This methodology has the potential to highlight care
fragmentation and integration. Fragmentation is arguably the most important underemphasized
goal in VA. Performance goals exist for quality of care and access, and there is a strong
infrastructure for managing cost. However, there is limited focus on reducing fragmentation and
improving integration, in part due to the lack of adequate measures. VA priorities include more
efficient resource use. Two VHA strategies to increase efficiency are to diligently find areas of
waste and correct to generate savings, and to improve the delivery of health care services by
ensuring care coordination across all care settings. Sequence-based fragmentation and
integration measures have the potential to directly inform these strategies.
Specific Aim: The specific aim of this two-year proposal is to determine whether VA
administrative data can be used to reliably measure mental health sequences of care. As an
exploratory aim, we will determine whether sequences may represent care fragmentation.
Methodology: We will use the VA Corporate Data Warehouse to collect evidence for internal
consistency and test-retest reliability. Approximately 46,000 Veterans will be sampled in each of
6 annual cohorts (FY2013-FY2018) across 54 medical centers. We will use sequence analysis
to identify clusters of similar sequences that are characterized by a common consensus
sequential pattern. Internal consistency will be determined by comparing random patient
samples to determine if patient sequences are more similar within consensus sequential
patterns than between patterns. Test-retest reliability will compare patterns over time. We
expect a step function where sequences will be similar over time, with periodic changes as
capabilities improve. Generally, proximal sequences will be more similar than distal sequences.
For the exploratory aim, we will calculate patient-level correlations with administrative database
measures of care fragmentation and facility-level correlations with VA performance measures.
A Delphi process with an expert panel will the degree to which each sequence generated by the
methodology may measure fragmentation. This will provide preliminary data for the next study.
Next Steps/Implementation: This two-year study will determine whether the sequence analysis
method can be applied to VA administrative data to identify reliable care sequences. The output
of the Delphi process and the convergent and discriminant validity tests will allow the team to
develop specific hypotheses about VA depression care sequences that will be tested in a follow-
up study. The next step will be to determine the association of depression care sequences with
mental health symptoms, functioning, satisfaction, and cost. Our long-term goal is to develop a
method for measuring care sequences in near-real time and provide feedback to managers and
clinicians to identify patients regarding care sequences that may require intervention."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) was once considered a monolithic disorder of canonical symptoms and definitive
pathology, but recent work has identified considerably heterogeneity in onset, progression, and histologic
features. Despite this important shift in clinical perspective, we don't yet know if or how the range of brain
pathologies explains the diversity in clinical trajectories. We also can't explain how neuropathological diversity
arises in the first place, even for the canonical traits of amyloid, tangles, and neurodegeneration. It would be
instructive to understand how such diverse structures arise and what if any role each plays in cognitive decline,
but this insight has been stymied by human pathological heterogeneity combined with a paucity of appropriate
animal models to replicate these extremes. We unexpectedly discovered a possible cellular explanation for the
emergence of neuritic vs diffuse amyloid structures while characterizing two new transgenic lines that
expressed the same APP construct selectively in glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. Both models
developed pronounced Ab deposits, but showed divergent patterns of pathology and Ab profiles.
Glutamatergic APP mice formed cored, thioflavin-positive neuritic plaques composed of both Ab40 and 42,
while GABAergic APP mice formed diffuse, thioflavin-negative plaques composed primarily of Ab42. These
complementary APP transgenic models, with their respective diffuse and neuritic plaque pathology, now allow
us to directly test the role of neuronal subtypes in plaque heterogeneity, identify the mechanistic basis for these
differences in APP processing, and determine how distinct plaque structures may be pathogenic or protective
through the divergent response of neighboring cells. Aim 1 will characterize the physical differences that
distinguish plaques generated by GABAergic vs glutamatergic neurons using electron microscopy, in vivo
seeding assays, and mass spectrometry. Aim 2 will determine how neuron-specific differences in APP
processing arise using snRNAseq transcriptomic analysis of each neuronal subtype. This aim will also
ascertain whether APP processing differences extend from overexpressed pathogenic APP to wild-type protein
expressed at endogenous levels. Finally, Aim 3 will dissect the downstream consequences of each aggregate
structure at the cell/molecular level using snRNAseq data and by testing cognitive function. Collectively we
expect these studies may cast a new light on excitatory:inhibitory balance in AD and advance a new
appreciation of neuronal heterogeneity as an important facet of disease pathogenesis."

Significant progress in recent years on the development of oncolytic virotherapy has led to the FDA approval
of a type I herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) based oncolytic virus (Talimogene Laherparepvec or T-VEC) for the
treatment of advanced melanoma. However, it has become increasingly clear that there is a need to further
improve the current version of OV for a better clinical benefit. Our lab has constructed a HSV-2 based oncolytic
virus - FusOn-H2, the first of its kind, by a novel mechanism. Our recent studies showed that arming FusOn-
H2 with a chimeric NK engager (C-NK-E) that can engage the infiltrated natural killer (NK) cells with tumor
cells could significantly enhance the effectiveness of this virotherapy. Moreover, we observed that tumor
destruction by the joint effect of the direct oncolysis and the engaged NK cells led to a measurable elicitation
of neoantigen-specific antitumor immunity. Based on these exciting findings, we propose to develop a three-
pronged strategy to enhance the antitumor efficacy of FusOn-H2 via combinatorial immuno-oncolytic
virotherapy (IOV). The antitumor activities from this strategic three-pronged IOV come in waves in a sequential
order. The first wave comes immediately and it derives primarily from the virus-mediated direct oncolysis. The
second wave comes from the NK-mediated tumor cell killing enabled jointly by the virotherapy-trigged NK cell
infiltration and the released C-NK-E from the armed virus. The third wave is the outcome of a series of chain
events that ultimately result in induction and homing of neoantigen-specific T cells. Our major hypothesis is
that this three-pronged strategy will act in a consequential and concerted way to significantly enhance the
therapeutic efficacy of this IOV. We have designed three specific aims to test our major hypothesis. In Aim 1,
we will dissect the mechanism of C-NK-E-armed virus in generating neoantigen-specific immunity and to
design additional strategies to further potentiate this effect. Neoantigens are attractive targets for cancer
immunotherapy, but there lacks a simple and effective way of delivering them. In principle, OV offers a simple
means to release these neoantigens in individual patients, and our proposed strategy will ensure their efficient
and timely presentation to the host’s immune system without the need for additional procedures. In Aim 2, we
will investigate if combining C-NK-Es that engage two different activation receptors can further potentiate the
NK cell killing and neoantigen-specific T cell immunity. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate that the three-pronged
IOV can produce an efficient therapeutic effect against metastatic diseases by the systemic delivery route.
We have recently developed novel strategies to overcome key obstacles for systemic delivery - the rapid
clearance by the macrophage system and the neutralizing antibodies. We hypothesize that the combination
of the high potency of the three-pronged IOV with the improved systemic delivery will lead to effective
treatment of metastatic diseases. Our studies in this proposal thus overcome the two major hurdles hindering
OV - the relatively weak therapeutic activity and lack of means for effective systemic delivery, and the
developed strategy can be translated into the clinic in the near future."

Congenital hematopoietic defects have been linked to a variety of co-morbidities affecting cardiovascular lineages, the kidneys, and limbs; curiously, their progenitor cells in the developing vertebrate embryo share a common embryonic origin in the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM). Understanding the developmental connection between hematopoietic lineage determination and other organ precursors forming from in part joint progenitor cells promises to shed light on the mechanisms of syndromic hematopoietic disorders. Thrombocytopenia Absent Radius (TAR) syndrome is a rare, congenital malformation that manifests as blood platelet defects and absent radius bones, concurrent with heart and kidney anomalies. TAR syndrome associates with chromosome 1q21.1 microdeletions that remove at least 20 genes including the exon junction complex (EJC) gene RBM8A/Y14 involved in splicing and mRNA degradation. Combined 1q21.1 microdeletion with compound inheritance of hypomorphic RBM8A alleles has found in a cohort of TAR patients, but how perturbed RBM8A/Y14 as general ubiquitous mRNA-processing factor causes the selective TAR phenotype remains to be uncovered. The syndrome’s phenotypes provide a paradigm for syndromic hematopoietic defects with complex co-morbidities which suggest that hypomorphic RBM8A perturbation predominantly impairs the lateral plate LPM when forming the progenitors for blood, limb, heart, and kidney. 
Using zebrafish as a model system and our leading CRISPR-Cas9-based protocols, we have successfully established a first mutant allelic series for rbm8a. In live in toto imaging of developing rbm8a mutants in transgenic zebrafish reporter strains, we detected migration defects of the hematopoietic progenitor-harboring LPM stripes, indicating an early defect in LPM patterning. Our data define the first embryonic rbm8a phenotypes in the LPM and hematopoietic progenitors using zebrafish as in vivo platform to identify the developmental cause of distinctive hematopoietic lineage perturbation in TAR syndrome. Mechanistically, from our transcriptome analysis of rbm8a-mutant zebrafish embryos, we found that planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling components are deregulated, providing a key candidate pathway for perturbed hematopoietic progenitor migration in rbm8a mutants. We hypothesize that PCP/non-canonical WNT signaling results in a selective, pathological phenotype in the LPM. We will identify the mechanism as to how select mRNAs, in particular components of PCP signaling, are perturbed in rbm8a mutants, resulting in higher sensitivity to migration defects using genetic interaction studies and enhanced crosslinking immunoprecipitation (eCLIP). Our results will connect the control of early PCP/non-canonical WNT-based LPM migration to consequences in hematopoietic progenitor formation and establish a proxy to better understand the causes and connections between hematological and related phenotypes of syndromic birth defects."

The prime objective of our multi-center National K12 “Diabetes-Docs: Physician-Scientist Career
Development Program” (DiabDocs) is to support the research career development of the next generation of
physician-scientists in basic and clinical diabetes for academic careers with a specific focus on type 1 diabetes
(T1D). Our structured K12 program is designed to provide a mentored research experience together with
tailored career development training. Given the historically low rates of persons under-represented in medicine
entering diabetes research careers, we propose and prioritize here intentional evidence-based effort toward
support and funding for these individuals. We propose these aims to achieve the DiabDocs program goals:
1) Create a national cohort of up-and-coming physician-scientist researchers, developing cohesion through
shared programmatic training cohort experiences including an annual retreat;
2) Expand the geographical and pipeline reach of current diabetes K12 programs so that diverse K12 Scholar
candidates can be trained locally while maintaining the historic strengths of the past diabetes K12 programs;
3) Develop an outstanding national mentor community to train diabetes physician-scientists and provide a
more visible pathway to research careers for medical students/residents/fellows by active recruitment
programs and inclusion in the DiabDocs retreat and educational programs;
4) Ensure consistency and effectiveness of mentoring, including directed attention to Diversity, Equity, and
Inclusion (DEI) across research centers through shared mentor training and resources.
In addition to our MPI structure, one of the distinguishing features of our program is the inclusion of all recently-
funded K12 Scholar program PIs and their experience as part of the DiabDocs Executive Leadership
Committee (ELC) complemented by addition of two Adult Endocrinology physician-scientists with expertise in
basic science, health services research, & DEI programs. In addition to these ELC investigators, we have
engaged diverse physician-scientists from 15 additional institutions without K12 programs in diabetes, but with
a strong interest in engaging with DiabDocs. These institutions bring a wealth of expertise including T32, K12,
P30, and CTSA funding. DiabDocs will leverage these resources as well as their wide curricula of study and
research experiences to provide our K12 scholars high quality training from a diverse faculty.
We anticipate funding 55 Scholar Years over 5 years with each Scholar spending up to 3 years on the K12, but
we budget for 2 year terms on average with 27-28 Scholars funded with the goal to obtain independent career
development funding such as a K08/K23. Our K12 scholars will be well-positioned to serve as catalysts for
multidisciplinary investigations bridging bench-to-bedside science leading to patient-centered discoveries. We
are confident that we will attract the highest caliber of applicants and mentor them toward impactful careers in
academic medicine as skilled physician-scientist leaders."

In the previous funding cycle, the Neuropathology Core (Core B) established a highly effective brain tissue
banking system that greatly facilitates the success of research projects in this PPG. In the renewal proposal,
Core B will continue its mission to provide high quality 2nd – 3rd trimester, perinatal and early postnatal human
brain tissues from the Autopsy Service in the Department of Pathology at UCSF for all the components of the
PPG. In particular, Core B will focus on preparing tissues for single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), single nucleus
RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), RNAscope and ultrastructural analyses, which will prepare researchers and project
leaders in this PPG to characterize the molecular and cellular mechanisms of cell lineages in the developing
human brains. Core B will develop state-of-the-art molecular markers that will facilitate the discovery and
characterizations of neuron-glia interactions during normal human brain development. Core B will provide full-
time histopathology services that facilitate the progress among the research projects in this PPG as well as
coordinate activities with the internal and external advisory committees. In essence, the aim of the
Neuropathology Core is to function as a centralized facility where human brain tissues and advances in
histopathology techniques can be utilized to provide support and integration of services for all investigators. The
core director will work with the project leaders and make decisions regarding the use of core services. As an
active member of the PPG, the core director will participate in weekly meetings regarding administrative and
scientific matters such as research directions, requests for specific human tissues, data analyses, collaborations
and presentations of data. The core director and co-director, in consultation with Dr. Alveraz-Buylla, Dr. Rowitch,
Dr. Fancy, and Dr. Piao, will evaluate the specific needs and cost-effectiveness in order to maximize the service
of Core B to each research project. The core director will ensure that quality control is provided at the highest

Transcriptomic Core (C) provides critical state-of-the-art services to support all of the Projects in this proposal.
Core C will apply whole cell and nuclear single cell transcriptomics to evaluate molecular identity and activated
gene networks in specific neural and non-neural human brain cells, and will use cutting-edge `Large area
spatial transcriptomics (LaST)' to map gene expression across cell types and brain regions at key stages of
human 3rd trimester-term neonatal brain development. The use of these technologies will advance our
understanding of the mechanisms of cell lineage development in preterm and term neonatal human brain and
serve as a high-resolution molecular map against which to measure how perinatal injuries, such as hypoxic
ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) impact the development of the brain. Additionally, Core C will work with project
leaders to develop a battery of novel cell-specific markers for already defined cell types, such as neural
progenitor cells, newly born neurons, microglia, and glial cell lineages, as well as novel markers that will serve
as tools to identify and characterize the newly-described cell types of the neonatal human brain such as the
migrating neuronal streams that have already been discovered during the initial tenure of this proposal.
Core C will be directed jointly by Drs. Kriegstein and Rowitch who have expertise in human brain development
and in single cell transcriptomics and spatial transcriptomics respectively. Dr. Kriegstein will provide oversight
and guidance of day-to-day operations, scheduling and experimental design. Dr. Kriegstein's laboratory has
developed and validated both single cell and single nuclei mRNA sequencing technology recently documented
in two joint publications with the Rowitch laboratory (Velmeshev et al, Science, 2019; Schirmer et al, Nature
2019); the Rowitch laboratory has designed a unique pathway for Large-area spatial transcriptomic (LaST)
mapping of mouse and human brain (Bayraktar et al., 2019, Nat Neurosci; Schirmer et al, Nature 2019);. The
combined use of both of these technologies will enable Projects 1-3 to molecularly profile diverse cell types
including interneurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglia, discover new cell type specific markers, and map the
in situ expression patterns of genes identified through single cell mRNA sequencing. The Core Directors,
assisted by Dr. Dmitry Velmeshev, a talented bio-informatician who will serve as Core Manager, have
developed an organizational scheme for Core C that is designed to meet the complementary needs of all the
projects. They will also assist project leaders and trainees in the PPG in order to optimize design and
execution of their single cell sequencing and mapping projects. In addition, Core C will work with the Scientific
Advisory Committee to maintain the highest standard of quality control and with the Administrative Core (Core
A) to manage operational and budgetary issues. Core C will provide critical support to help achieve the goals
of Projects 1-3 that will, together, provide new insights into human brain development at clinically important
neonatal stages of development."
10851775,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cortical interneurons are a diverse set of local inhibitory cells essential for proper balance of
excitation and inhibition and key to brain function. Abnormal development of interneurons can
lead to severe neuropsychiatric disorders (interneuropathies). Identification of the molecular
pathways and cellular populations implicated in these disorders is necessary to understand their
etiology and to improve our ability to predict which individuals are at risk. Work from our original
grant demonstrated that the infant frontal lobe maintains a large population of migratory
interneurons for several months after birth. This collection of migrating young neurons (Arc)
targets many areas of the infant frontal lobe. These cells contribute importantly to the final
interneuron composition of the human brain (e.g. cingulate gyrus). The human cortex,
therefore, continues to receive interneurons for several months after birth, especially in areas of
higher cognition implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Similarly, our recent evidence
shows that the human amygdala continues to receive many young neurons postnatally. These
observations significantly change how we view the development of the infant brain and raise the
need to better understand the origins of human cortical interneurons, including those that
migrate postnatally in the Arc. Young neurons in the human Arc and amygdala are postmitotic
(Ki67-), supporting the hypothesis that they are not generated within these regions. The
expression pattern of regional transcription factors in the Arc, suggests that they come from the
developing human ventral forebrain; the Medial and Caudal Ganglionic Eminences (hMGE and
hCGE). The project's overall goal is to understand how the human GE generates large
numbers and diverse types of cortical interneurons by studying its development during the mid-
late gestation and early postnatal life. We will determine the genetic and molecular properties of
proliferative populations in the hMGE, hLGE, and hCGE using human postmortem brain
samples from neonatal and infant cases (up to 6 months after birth), define how interneuron
subtypes arise in the perinatal human brain. The proposed studies will identify the unique and
sustained properties of human inhibitory neuron development. By using a multi-disciplinary
approach (including transcriptomic, histological, and acute slice cultures), we aim to establish
how interneurons are made in the human brain and provide the fundamental knowledge needed
to understand their role in disease."
10849140,"Project summary and abstract
During a malicious acute infection of epithelial cells, the HSV-1 completed a robust but well-
organized gene expression (approximately 90 unique transcriptional units) in about 18-20 hours.
The viruses then entered the ganglionic neurons through the innervating nerves and attempted
to establish a dormant state of infection (latency). During the latency initiation, the vigorous viral
gene expression is almost completely suppressed with only a few noncoding RNA detected in
host neurons.
We believe the neurons played a key role in the HSV-1 gene silencing and latency establishment.
Previously, we used a rodent dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neuronal model to investigate the
crosstalk between the viral replication and the neuronal discharge during latency and reactivation.
We found that HSV-1 neuronal infection abolished the functional expression of voltage-gated Na+
and Ca2+ channels within hours. The neurons responded to the assault by rescuing the Na+ &
Ca2+ channel expression during the course of latency and established latent reservoir. Induced
viral reactivation would decrease the channel activity and increase viral gene expression.
Elevated neuronal firing, nonetheless, would reduce the viral gene expression and release of
infectious viruses. Therefore, we hypothesize that neuronal excitation offered an environment to
suppress viral replication thus facilitate the establishment and maintenance of latency.
To understand the mechanisms, we developed an in vitro human DRG neuronal model HD10.6,
which mimics the mature neurons for latency and reactivation in human. We showed for the first
time that a human microRNA overexpression facilitate a quiescent state of infection in HD10.6
without the need of replication inhibitor Acyclovir. In this proposal, we will first characterize the
voltage-gated channel activity in HD10.6. Next, we will investigate how virus attacked the
neuronal discharge to facilitate its infection. Finally, we will determine the counteracting schemes
that neurons exploited to repress viral replication and keep the virus in a dormant state from
reactivation."

Medicine, which began in 2019 and is designed to provide rigorous, interdisciplinary training of postdoctoral
scientists in the translational genomic, clinical and computational sciences that are driving a new era of precision
and genomic medicine. Our proposal brings together three outstanding components to build a world-class
training program genomic medicine: 1) an internationally-recognized faculty of experienced mentors with
expertise in precision and genomic medicine across a broad range of disciplines, 2) outstanding institutional
resources bridging clinical, genomic, and data sciences, and 3) deep engagement with cutting edge,
collaborative initiatives at the regional, national, and international levels to provide rich training experiences. The
program has a particular emphasis in four domains of precision and genomic medicine in which the participating
institutions and faculty have become national and international leaders: 1) medical genetics and genomics; 2)
data science; 3) molecular medicine; and 4) implementation science. A core element of the training program is
a mentored research experience that includes mentored research projects and career development guidance.
We have assembled a group of 55 established and highly collaborative faculty mentors across the Mass General
Brigham Healthcare System (including Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital)
as well as Harvard Medical School, MIT, the Broad Institute, and Boston Children’s Hospital). The program also
provides a structured but flexible curriculum of didactic courses, journal clubs, and seminars covering scientific
foundations, essential skills for career development, team science, and RCR training. Trainees work closely with
a mentorship team comprising a Primary Mentor, a Secondary Mentor (providing complementary experience or
collaboration opportunities to their primary research focus), and the two Program Directors. An individualized
training program will be developed and monitored in conjunction with the mentorship team. Trainees also benefit
from access to extensive data networks and resources in which our faculty have played leading roles including
the eMERGE network, TOPMed, the All of Us Research Program, ClinGen, the MGB Biobank, gnomAD, the
Center for Mendelian Genomics, the Undiagnosed Diseases Network, and others. We have established new
partnerships to enhance the recruitment and retention of trainees from underrepresented backgrounds. Program
oversight will include guidance from a Steering Committee of senior faculty mentors and an External Advisory
Board of nationally-renowned leaders spanning the four domains of precision and genomic medicine research.
As in our past cycle, the program is geared toward physician-scientists as well as PhD or equivalent scientists
intending to develop careers in precision or genomic medicine research. Trainees are supported for two years

national public health surveillance programs. This competing renewal builds upon the assets of
Boston Children's Hospital, housing the largest PEM faculty worldwide, to create a culture of
rigorous research and training. The program's goals remain to prepare trainees for independent
research in PEM and address the critical need for research mentors in the field. The next
funding cycle plans to include 12 participating trainees. Trainees in the PEMRTP will progress
through four interrelated phases, including mentored research projects, ongoing didactic
instruction, formal coursework (optional), and preparation of a research grant. Additionally,
trainees have the opportunity to pursue formal coursework for advanced degrees such as
Master of Medical Science or Master of Public Health. Benefiting from the extensive research
laboratories, clinical systems, academic programs, experienced faculty, and connections to
multisite research networks at Boston Children's Hospital, the Computational Health Informatics
Program, and the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School, the
PEMRTP provides an unparalleled environment for mentoring trainees to become future leaders
in pediatric emergency medicine research."

Psoriatic Spectrum Diseases (PSD) affect over 8 million individuals in the U.S. living with psoriasis (PsO) or
psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and encompass heterogeneous phenotypes of disease, ranging from plaque, guttate,
palmoplantar, inverse, pustular, and erythrodermic forms of psoriasis, to synovial, enthesial, and axial forms of
PsA. Here, we assembled a world class multidisciplinary team of scientists in PSD cohort assembly, clinical
phenotyping, biosample acquisition, pathology, statistics, and bioinformatics, for the Accelerating Medicines
Partnership Autoimmune and Immune-Mediated Diseases (AMP AIM) PSD Disease Teams (DTs).
The major scientific goals of the PSD DT are to understand the cellular and molecular composition of distinct
PSD endotypes and how they link with phenotypes, to identify how key pathogenic or regulatory cells spatially
interact with each other and with environmental cues (i.e., microbiome), and to define at a single-cell level how
the transition to PsA unfolds in the setting of PsO. To accomplish the goals of the PSD AMP, we propose the
creation of the ELLIPSS (ELucidating the Landscape of Immunoendotypes in Psoriatic Skin and Synovium)
Disease Team (DT). The AIMS of the ELLIPSS Team are to 1) to enroll diverse PSD cohorts and perform clinical
phenotyping, data capture, and tissue collection. 2) to implement an effective management plan for the ELLIPSS
multidisciplinary team. 3) to optimize interface of ELLIPSS team with AMP-AIM network. Lastly, a robust
Opportunities Fund (OF) management program is proposed under the direction and leadership of Dr. James T.
Elder at University of Michigan.
The ELLIPSS PSD DT will efficiently integrate with the AMP AIM Network, facilitate collection of PSD biosamples,
and help provide an unprecedented view of cell types and states, along with spatial and tissue interactions (skin,
joint, blood, microbiome) to deconstruct/reconstruct the psoriatic disease spectrum."
10836979,"Abstract. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop and test a novel machine learning (ML) accelerated
On-Line Adaptive Replanning (MOLAR) solution for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided radiation
therapy (RT) (MRgRT). During the multi-fraction RT process, the location, shape and size of tumors and
normal organs vary significantly between the fractions. These interfraction variations are among the major
factors that can limit the accuracy of RT targeting. The current standard practice of image-guided RT (IGRT),
developed to address the interfraction variations based on cone-beam CT (CBCT), can only correct for
translational errors, and thus does not fully account for interfraction changes. To address this issue,
researchers recently introduced online adaptive replanning (OLAR) that generates a new plan based on the
anatomy of the day and delivers the plan for the fraction. Currently, two main obstacles affect the success of
OLAR: (1) the anatomy of the day cannot be delineated accurately based on CBCT, and (2) the time required
to perform OLAR is long enough to render it impractical. One way to improve the delineation accuracy is to use
MRI versus CT. MRI-guided OLAR is currently being introduced into the clinics to substantially improve RT
targeting. However, the bottleneck is still the impractical length of time required to segment the anatomy of the
day, which can exceed 30 minutes. Furthermore, available synthetic CT (sCT) generation methods are slow or
inaccurate for MRI-guided OLAR. There is no method available to quickly and objective determine when OLAR
is necessary. To address these issues, we plan to develop novel techniques in the MOLAR solution. We
hypothesize that the MRI-based MOLAR solution will fully account for interfraction changes, thereby
substantially improving tumor targeting during RT delivery and the effectiveness of RT. Specifically, we aim to
(1) develop practical ML-based solutions to quickly determine the necessity of OLAR and to rapidly generate
accurate synthetic CTs; (2) develop ML-based techniques to substantially accelerate segmentation for OLAR
using a progressive three-step process; and (3) verify clinical practicality and effectiveness of MOLAR by
retrospectively and prospectively applying the MOLAR on MRI sets to test its speed and effectiveness in
accounting for interfraction variations. We will develop this novel MOLAR solution by forging unique
collaborations between clinical physicists, radiation oncologists and industry developers via an established
academic-industry partnership. The successful completion of this project will enable clinicians to routinely
practice “image-plan-treat”, which is the optimal solution for MRgRT. This new paradigm will fully account for
interfraction variations, improve tumor targeting, reduce normal tissue toxicity, and ultimately encourage
clinicians to revise the current doses and/or dose fractionations to increase therapeutic gain, enhance patient
quality of life, and/or substantially save on healthcare costs. Our proposed strategy represents a drastic
departure from current practice. We firmly believe that this strategy is the future of RT delivery."
10833028,"To impact human health, bacteria must reproduce through successive rounds of growth and cell division.
Moreover, bacteria must be able to adapt their growth to changing environmental conditions, including changes
in nutrient availability or the presence of antibiotics, to ensure survival. Research in my laboratory focuses on
two unanswered questions central to bacterial growth and adaptation. In the first, we ask how do bacterial cells
locally regulate growth to achieve cell division? To address this question, we will build on our recent work
demonstrating that the conserved, polymerizing GTPase FtsZ is a dynamic regulator of cell wall synthesis and
remodeling during cell division. This idea represents a paradigm shift in defining FtsZ as an active regulator,
rather than passive scaffold, for cell wall metabolism. We will leverage our expertise in bacterial genetics,
imaging, biochemistry, and in vitro reconstitution to map the players and mechanisms in two signaling
pathways from FtsZ to cell wall metabolism we identified in our model organism, Caulobacter crescentus.
Given the urgent need for new antibiotics and proven efficacy of the cell wall as an antibacterial target, a
complete understanding of the mechanisms and regulation of cell wall metabolism is a critical goal. In our
second question, we ask how do bacteria adapt to changing nutrient availability and other stresses? We
recently described the role of a conserved transcriptional regulator called CdnL in regulating metabolism,
specifically in upregulating biosynthetic pathways, in Caulobacter. In addition, we have observed that CdnL is
cleared from the cell during nutrient limitation in a manner dependent on the signaling alarmone ppGpp,
suggesting a mechanism by which cells may downregulate transcription of proliferative pathways when
nutrients are scarce. We will use a combination of genetic, genomic, and biochemical approaches to determine
the contributions of CdnL inactivation and ppGpp to reprogramming transcription to ensure bacterial survival
during nutrient limitation and other stresses. As both CdnL and ppGpp are implicated in adaptation to a variety
of stresses in diverse bacteria, this work will inform our understanding stress and antibiotic resistance
mechanisms in important bacterial pathogens."
10833140,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a major public health concern in the United States. TBI can result in
long-term neurological complications, including neurodegeneration, behavioral dysfunction, depression and
epilepsy that seriously affect patient quality-of-life. Brain glucose utilization has been found decreased in 60%
of patients with chronic TBI and is one of the prognostic indicators for the long-term outcome of TBI. Both
animal and human studies have identified that the neurovascular uncoupling between cerebral blood flow
(CBF) and brain tissue energy demands is a key factor for cerebral metabolic crisis in the TBI brain. The
neurovascular uncoupling results in energy mismatch that disrupts normal neuroglial function and arrests
repairing process. Despite numerous clinical trials on potential therapies, there is no U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approved drug therapy for the treatment of TBI. One of the reason clinical trials failed is due to
the inability that can accurately evaluate the region-specific perturbations of brain glucose metabolism and
determine if a treatment can restore neurovascular coupling in the TBI brain. Existent glucose measuring
techniques, including microdialysis, continuing blood glucose monitoring, spectroscopy, or positron emission
tomography (PET) which uses tracer radioisotopes, provide insufficient resolution to determine region-specific
glucose utilization in the brain. In this proposal, we determine to assess the utility of a novel MRI-based
Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) imaging, to provide the needed high-resolution for measuring
region-specific metabolism for TBI. The glucose detecting CEST MRI (glucoCEST) measures brain glucose by
detecting the exchangeable proton signals of glucose without using radioisotopes and generates glucose
mapping in a resolution >100 times higher than PET scans. Our preliminary and published data have
demonstrated that glucoCEST may be feasible to detect the delayed hypometabolism of diffuse TBI in rats. We
propose to combine high-resolution glucoCEST and the Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) perfusion MRI for
concomitant CBF measurements to identify the neurovascular coupling state following TBI over time. Our aims
are designed to (1) Identify the contrast mechanism of in vivo glucoCEST in the TBI brain to enhance the
sensitivity and specificity of glucoCEST with advanced acquisition scheme and analytical models, (2)
Characterize perturbations in brain glucose metabolism and perfusion deficits in the TBI brain, and (3)
Demonstrate the potential application of the dual-modality CEST-DCE MRI to noninvasively monitor the
treatment effects of a clinically-recommended intervention for TBI. Overall, these studies will provide a strong
technical and scientific foundation to move the field forward in utilization of advanced MRI for personalized
care in the clinical arena and determine the best treatment strategy for the brain injured patients."
10833141,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Kidney stones affect one in 11 Americans. With related expenditures of $4.5 billion annually, they also pose a
tremendous resource burden. In addition, they are not a one-off event with 50% of patients developing a
recurrence within five years of their first stone. Thus, interventions that reduce recurrent stones may promote
health and have positive economic implications. The use of thiazide diuretics, alkali citrate treatment, or
allopurinol—referred to as preventive pharmacological therapy (PPT)—may represent one such intervention.
Yet, while current guidelines recommend PPT, it is infrequently used. A recent systematic review funded by the
Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality highlighted three gaps in the evidence base for PPT, tempering
enthusiasm for it. First, findings from prior studies were driven mainly by intermediate outcomes, but what
matters to patients and providers is whether an intervention will prevent future pain episodes that require an
emergency department (ED) visit, hospitalization, or surgery. Second, prior studies reported few data on
treatment tolerability. Third, the impact that PPT has on future costs in stone formers is largely unknown. If this
therapy yields a substantial savings to the healthcare system over the long run, acceptance of it may increase.
An obstacle to filling these three gaps has been the availability of data sources with the necessary sample size,
clinical granularity, and long-term follow-up for examining the real-world effectiveness of PPT. To overcome
this obstacle, we propose a study using innovative linkages of administrative and clinical data. Our proposal
has three Specific Aims. Aim 1: To evaluate the impact that PPT has on clinical outcomes. Using the
Veterans Health Administration Corporate Data Warehouse and Medicare claims linked with urine chemistry
data from Litholink Corporation, we will identify adults with kidney stones, distinguishing patients prescribed
thiazides, citrates, or allopurinol from those receiving usual care. We will evaluate ED visit, hospitalization, and
surgery rates in these two groups. Aim 2: To examine patient tolerability for PPT. As an assessment of
tolerability, we will then measure medication adherence and adverse event rates among patients prescribed
thiazides, citrates, or allopurinol. We will examine differences in tolerability across patient subgroups. Aim 3:
To determine the healthcare costs associated with PPT use. Finally, we will assess longitudinal payments
for patients with kidney stones. We will determine whether variability in these payments exists between
patients prescribed PPT versus those receiving usual care. Findings from our study serve to inform the optimal
management of kidney stones. To this end, patients will ultimately benefit most from our research."
10833142,"ABSTRACT
Electrocorticography (ECoG) uses many sensors to measure mesoscale electrical potentials directly
from the surface of cerebral cortex, termed cortical surface electrical potentials (CSEPs). Though
ECoG has long been used clinically, newly improved fabrication procedures have enabled devices
with sufficiently small electrodes to record very high-frequency, spatially localized signals. These
high-frequency CSEPs may be primarily generated within a single cortical column, and thus are an
ideal signal to link investigation of brain function from local micro-circuit processing to broadly
distributed computations. No other current recording technology provides these signals in both
humans and animal models. ECoG is thus a critical methodological bridge between basic
neuroscience findings and our understanding of the human brain in health and disease. However,
adoption of ECoG for basic neuroscience, and realizing its full potentials in humans, is impeded by a
lack of understanding of the precise biophysical processes that generate CSEPs.
 We have collaborated in the design of novel ECoG devices with small electrodes. With these
devices, we discovered that CSEPs include multiple distinct high-frequency (>100Hz) components,
which are spatially localized to the diameter of a cortical column. Here, we propose to use direct
electrophysiological monitoring and optogenetic perturbations in rats and mice, combined with
biophysically detailed simulations to reveal the origins of these distinct frequency components of
ECoG signals. We hypothesize that distinct CSEP components represent distinct cell types and
laminar sources within a cortical column, and thus report different types of information in the local
cortical network associated with these sources
 This research will provide understanding of the cellular and biophysical origins of cortical
surface electrical potentials. By enhancing the spatial localization of sources associated with distinct
CSEP components, we will increase the precision with which ECoG can be used to monitor neuronal
processing. This will advance the use of ECoG in basic neuroscience for ‘columnar scale’
neurophysiology monitoring of distributed cortical processing at high temporal resolution."
10833032,"In the proposed renewal of the Neuroscience Scholars Program (NSP), the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) will build on the program’s history of enhancing career development and professional networking opportunities for graduate and postdoctoral neuroscience researchers from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups and individuals with disabilities (underrepresented neuroscience researchers, or UNRs). The 2019-2024 NSP will pursue three specific aims intended to achieve a diverse neuroscience workforce thriving in research and leadership positions: (1) provide intensive networking, mentoring, and career-building activities to at least 84 NSP Fellows by retaining successful programmatic elements while deepening mentoring, networking, and leadership-building activities; (2) round out current career-enhancing activities for up to 350 NSP Associates to include in-person and online professional development programming as well as new opportunities to travel to the SfN Annual Meeting; and (3) engage NSP Alumni as leaders and mentors in the NSP and broader neuroscience community to support their continued career trajectory and long-term professional success in neuroscience. SfN will continue NSP’s key strategies of providing mentoring, financial support, and social integration and community-building opportunities but will deepen the NSP experience for both Fellows and Associates by emphasizing leadership-building and lifelong mentoring in multiple ways. The renewal period will provide opportunities for NSP Fellows, Associates, and Alumni to lead NSP webinars and online discussions, serve as NSP class advisors and mentors, and organize a new biennial mid-year NSP Conference. These NSP activities seek to build the assets of knowledge, skills, and experience of underrepresented neuroscience researchers to optimally facilitate their progress and transition to more advanced research, education, and training activities. Since 1982, over 900 graduate students and postdoctoral UNRs have completed the NSP and become part of the career-long community of NSP Alumni. Evaluation studies consistently show that NSP Alumni continue along successful career trajectories, attain senior leadership positions in academia and industry, publish actively in peer-reviewed journals, attract grant funding for their research programs, serve as visible role models, and by their example and mentorship, influence the next generation of UNRs to contribute their diverse perspectives to furthering excellence in the field of neuroscience."

The major goal of this research is to identify the genetic risk factors with functional significance to
dementia in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. The key aspect of dementia is age-
dependent neurodegeneration that cripples executive functions (e.g. inhibitory control) and
memory. Most dementia studies have focused on memory loss, which is a prominent symptom of
AD - the most common dementia type. While animal models have provided important insights into
the mechanism for memory loss, their utility for dementia gene discovery is limited since the study
of memory loss is time-consuming and laborious. Executive deficits are major symptoms in early
stage AD and related dementias yet largely understudied. We overcome these limitations by
studying inhibitory control deficit as a dementia endophenotype for the discovery of dementia
genes, which is innovative. Our approach is to conduct an unbiased screen for the genetic loci
causing dysfunctional inhibitory control in an age-dependent manner, with or without the non-
genetic risk factors. In this proposal we will also test the hypothesis that the genetic and non-
genetic risk factor interaction has a greater effect on dementia than a genetic factor alone.
Drosophila is tractable for student research training and education as it is easy to handle, allows to
readily apply state-of-the-art tools and approaches, and is cost-and time-effective. There is
currently no other biological research on dementia at UTEP. Dementia prevalence is
disproportionately higher in Hispanics than white Americans thus this study will not only promote
research relevant to our students and community but also increase the representation of Hispanics
in neuroscience research that is disproportionately low at present."

 Family members have a key role in facilitating the initiation of mental health services. Yet, Black/African
American families often encounter barriers and experience delays accessing coordinated specialty care
programs. These delays can be attributed to individual (e.g., knowledge), interpersonal (e.g.,
connectedness), community (e.g., access), and societal (e.g., discrimination) factors. In other health related
areas, peer navigator models improve access to much needed services and promote more positive
experiences among individuals and their families. However, there are have been no family peer navigator
models developed to address the complexities that impact Black/African American families to improve access
to coordinated specialty care programs. Preliminary research suggests approximately 70% of Black/African
American family members report no contact with clinicians prior to initial diagnosis and the receipt of services
for early psychosis. Among Black/African Americans, family member engagement prior to services and during
treatment for first episode psychosis significantly impacts clinical and functional outcomes among youth
enrolled in coordinated specialty care programs. Building upon formative research, this mixed methods study
will be conducted in three phases to develop, refine, and pilot-test a multi-component Family Peer Navigator
model designed to increase access and engagement in coordinated specialty care programs Black families.
A community advisory board will provide feedback during each Phase II and III to refine the navigator model.
The Family Peer Navigator model will utilize telephone-based strategies and encompass the Cultural
Formulation Interview to tailor family psychoeducation and care coordination. Phase I and Phase II utilize an
exploratory-sequential mixed methods design to refine the Family Peer Navigator model and implementation
strategy. Phase I involves qualitative interviews with coordinated specialty care directors and providers, and
agency-level administrators. Phase II is a 4-month open trial that will recruit up to 10 Black families. Phase
III will consist of an embedded mixed methods designed randomized pilot trial of the Family Peer Navigator
model against a low-intensive care coordination in two coordinated specialty care programs. The
acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary impact will be assessed in a sample of 40 Black/African American
families with a loved one at risk for psychosis or currently experiencing their first episode of psychosis. Other
outcomes include proposed treatment targets (self-efficacy, knowledge, social connectedness), preliminary
impact outcomes (time to coordinated specialty care programs, initial family engagement), and
implementation outcomes (acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness). This study will establish an innovative
culturally informed family peer navigator model and generate preliminary data to support a Type II hybrid
effectiveness-implementation R01 application."
10833680,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Locomotor and balance dysfunction, which have a pernicious effect on independence and quality of life, are
caused by of a broad range of neural and musculoskeletal disorders as well as normal aging. While existing
treatment methods can counter some dysfunctions, some pathologies are persistent, such as weight-bearing
asymmetry and reduced adaptability. These pathologies are strongly defined by the dynamics of the physical
interaction between the feet and the ground. Thus, there is a critical need for novel tools to study, and ultimately
assist or re-train, how humans manage their physical interaction with the ground. The objective of the proposed
research is to enable new research into motor learning and human adaptation and provide an accessible,
effective vehicle for gait and balance rehabilitation through the development of portable robotic footwear which
can modify stiffness at the foot-ground interface in real-time. The significant contributions of this work include: 1)
creating the technical capability to change foot-ground interaction dynamics in both real-world and laboratory
settings, 2) enabling new methods of studying, assisting, and re-training human gait and balace, 3) significantly
advancing scientific knowledge by quantifying human adaptation to long-term changes in foot-ground interaction
dynamics, an understudied area of research, and 4) improving clinical practice by providing a portable tool to
make new treatments, preventative interventions, and early diagnoses widely accessible. The proposed research
is innovative because it will employ a transdisciplinary approach, applying concepts from neuromotor control,
biomechanics, and robotics, to develop a novel robotic device for research, assistance, and rehabilitation. This
proposal addresses the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Design, build and evaluate portable, robotic footwear that can actively modulate foot-ground
stiffness and measure the ground reaction forces of each foot independently.
We will design, fabricate, and validate robotic footwear with an active mechanism to modulate foot-ground
interface stiffness in real-time. The stiffness control system and onboard sensors will be rigorously evaluated for
validity and reliability with bench testing along with a pilot study with healthy participants performing whole-body
balance and walking tasks while wearing the device. Human testing will also evaluate the perceived safety,
comfort, and overall usability of the system.
Aim 2: Explore the effect of asymmetrically reducing foot-ground stiffness with the robotic footwear on
human motor behavior during standing and walking.
An additional pilot study will be conducted with healthy participants to assess how human motor behavior
changes in response to active foot-ground stiffness modulation. Results will inform the potential utility of the
robotic footwear for basic and clinical research applications and the development of models to understand human
neuromotor control of locomotion and balance."
10833687,"The skeletal system provides crucial structural and functional support to the body. The long-term objective of
this project is to uncover the pathogenesis of congenital skeletal disorders and develop strategies for skeletal
regeneration by elucidating the key signaling mechanisms governing skeletal development. Early mouse
genetic studies have uncovered a critical role of Wnt5a in limb skeletal development. Human mutations in
WNT5A have also been implicated in Autosomal Dominant Robinow syndrome (ADRS), a disorder that
manifests dwarfism and widespread skeletal dysplasia. Studies over the past 20 years have revealed that
Wnt5a is a non-canonical Wnt ligand that signals through receptor Frizzled (Fz) and co-receptors Ror1/2 to
activate the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway for limb morphogenesis during skeletal formation. The objective
of the current proposal is to characterize several fundamental properties of Wnt5a as a potent morphogen,
such as its signaling potency and range, the structural foundation that governs these properties, and how
human ADRS mutations alter its structure to modify WNT5A signaling. The objective will be achieved by
specifically testing 1) how two Wnt5a isoforms that differ by 18aa residues at the N-terminus may function
differently in PCP signaling to impact limb development; 2) how the Wnt5a isoforms and ADRS mutations may
alter the mode through which Wnt5a clusters together Fz and Ror to trigger PCP signaling; and 3) how the
ADRS mutations alter Wnt5a’s signaling potency and range during early limb development and endochondral
bone formation. Building on our preliminary studies that mouse transgenes encoding different Wnt5a isoforms
display remarkably different functional range in the limb, and that the two isoforms display different potency in
activating PCP in the Xenopus model, we will first determine whether their function range is solely determined
by the activity level difference, or additional factors such as dispersal ability during limb development.
Secondly, we will use a set of biochemical and biophysical assays to test a structural biology based model, in
which different N-terminal residues in Wnt5a isoforms and ADRS variants may alter the mode through which
Wnt5a brings together Fz and Ror to form distinct type of ligand/receptor complexes with different activity
levels. Thirdly, we will use a set of quantitative functional and molecular readout to determine how the ADRS
variants may cause elevated PCP signaling activity in Xenopus, and how these variants impact Wnt5a-
mediated skeletal development and endochondral bone formation in the mouse. These studies will elucidate
mechanistically how the N-terminal region may regulate Wnt5a’s signaling activity in PCP, and how alterations
in the N-terminus leads to skeletal defects in ADRS in humans."

Early life experiences can have profound and long-lasting consequences on health trajectories. Social inequities,
such as those caused by low resources, have been identified as important factors that influence the development
of psychiatric illnesses, including substance use disorders (SUD). In this proposal, a rat model of early life
scarcity will be combined with behavioral paradigms of substance abuse to better understand the neural and
molecular mechanisms that influence reward processing in individuals who experienced adversity early in life.
Each brain region contains highly heterogenous cell populations that include different neuronal subtypes as well
as glia. Accounting for the diversity and differences in cell types is essential to improving our understanding of
the impact of inequities on the brain and on motivated behavior. In this proposal, the influence of early life scarcity
on adult reward processing and motivation will be characterized in male and female rats using state-of-the-art
behavioral approaches where rats are tested for their motivation to earn drug (opioid) or natural (social and
sucrose) rewards. Our preliminary data indicate sex- and reinforcer-specific effects of early scarcity. This work
will be expanded here, and in some of the experiments, rats will choose between two available reinforcers. Given
that interventions for SUD involve social reinforcers, these results could have profound implications for the
prevention and treatment of SUD in populations who experience socioeconomic inequality. To better identify
factors that mediate the effects of early scarcity on motivated behavior, we will delineate molecular changes in
the nucleus accumbens—a central hub in the brain that is critical for motivated and reward-related behaviors—
and causally link them to behavior. To this end, we will perform cell-type specific assays of gene expression and
chromatin remodeling, an epigenetic process that regulates the expression of genes. Lastly, the proposal will
examine the impact of early life scarcity on the electrophysiological properties of two major neuron subtypes in
the nucleus accumbens, delineating cell type-specific physiological changes induced by altering the early
environment. Collectively, this proposal leverages cutting-edge behavioral, molecular, and physiological
approaches to provide a better understanding of the neurochemical and intracellular pathways affected by early
life scarcity that drive changes in motivated behavior. Importantly, the proposed experiments will determine sex-
and cell-type specific mechanisms by which early life scarcity alters the substance use trajectory, identifying
potential targets for improving therapeutics and prevention of SUDs."
10833580,"PROJECT SUMMARY .
Pediatric liver transplantation is a life-saving procedure for children with end-stage liver disease, yet long-term
outcomes remain sub-optimal. Children facing social adversity, and those from socioeconomically deprived
backgrounds have increased risk of graft failure and death following transplant. Disparities in post-transplant
outcomes are well-known, yet the field has thus far been unable to overcome them. In contrast, pediatric
primary care is rapidly evolving to develop assessment of specific social risk factors and integrate efficacious
interventions to address material economic hardships (e.g., food insecurity), poor health literacy, caregiver
mental health, social isolation, and neighborhood environment. One potential strategy, utilized in other fields, is
to incorporate Health Advocates (team members who help patients/families address social risks) into the
clinical team. To adapt a Health Advocate intervention to the needs of children undergoing liver transplantation,
a more nuanced understanding of which children are at highest risk, and how a health advocate could integrate
within the transplant team are needed. To that end, this study will leverage Dr. Wadhwani’s ongoing KL2
funded, multi-center prospective cohort (SOCIAL-Tx) across 8 U.S. transplant centers to achieve the following
Aims: (1) Characterize the association between social risks at the time of transplant with adverse outcomes at
1 and 3 years after transplant; (2) Use multi-stakeholder qualitative interviews (patients/families, physicians,
nurses, social workers) to characterize barriers and facilitators to optimal transplant care for patients/families
with social risks; (3) Assess feasibility of integrating a health advocate into a liver transplant team and pilot a
single-center study exploring whether targeted social support improves post-transplant outcomes. These Aims
will provide the necessary preliminary data for a future clustered, pragmatic multi-center RCT testing this
Health Advocate intervention. Dr. Wadhwani is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the University of
California, San Francisco. Building upon a strong foundation of research support, this K23 award will establish
him as an independent health services researcher pioneering research at the intersection of pediatric
hepatology, transplantation, and social determinants of health. Under the direct supervision of a
multidisciplinary team of leaders in liver transplant/multi-center cohort building (Jennifer Lai), pediatric
hepatology, and multi-center clinical trial design (John Bucuvalas), social care integration into health systems
(Laura Gottlieb), and qualitative and implementation science methods (Courtney Lyles), Dr. Wadhwani will
execute a detailed career development plan to achieve 4 training goals: (1) Pioneer a research niche
integrating social and medical care for children undergoing liver transplantation, (2) Develop expertise in social
adversity measurement and assessment, (3) Acquire skills necessary to develop, test, and implement health
system interventions (e.g., multi-center prospective mixed-methodology, survey methods, in-depth
interviewing, and ethnography), and (4) Develop skills in multi-center study design."
10833704,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The sequelae
from TBI can be long-lasting, and multiple studies have reported an increased rate of cognitive decline and higher
risk of dementia among persons with TBI. However, the mechanisms linking TBI to dementia remain poorly
understood, although vascular dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and aggregation of proteins have been
proposed. This gap in knowledge was recently highlighted in the 2020 Lancet Commission on Dementia, which
added TBI as one of twelve potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia, and in the 2019 NINDS Alzheimer’s
Disease-Related Dementias (ADRD) Summit, which formally recommended further study into the role of TBI in
dementia, including an emphasis on studying mechanism and developing TBI-AD/ADRD-related biomarkers. To
directly address this research need, this application builds on my prior NINDS R25 award and proposes to use
epidemiology, clinical studies, and vascular-related blood-based and neuroimaging biomarkers to investigate
vascular injury and subsequent vascular dysfunction as mechanisms linking TBI and dementia.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that TBI is associated with cognitive decline and dementia risk in part
via vasculopathy-mediated pathways which accelerate neurodegeneration for years post-TBI. This proposal will
leverage existing data from 2 ongoing prospective cohort studies (Aims 1 and 2) and new data from a
prospectively recruited cohort (Aim 3). The aims of this study are: 1) to determine if acute vascular injury is
associated with poor short-term TBI-related cognitive outcomes in the trauma center-based Transforming
Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI (TRACK-TBI) Study, 2) to investigate if chronic vascular dysfunction
mediates associations of TBI with poor long-term cognitive outcomes in the community-based Atherosclerosis
Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, and 3) to evaluate if the trajectory of post-TBI vascular dysfunction is
associated with short-term cognitive outcomes in a prospectively recruited cohort nested within ongoing studies
at the University of Pennsylvania Trauma Center. The overall objective of this proposal is to use multi-modal
biomarkers of vasculopathy to investigate mechanisms linking TBI and neurocognitive outcomes and to identify
time-periods during which future interventions may be effective at preventing TBI-related dementia.
In addition to the proposed research, this project will provide me with critical gap-based training, including in the
design, conduct, and implementation of clinical-epidemiologic studies and in the use of biomarkers as a method
to investigate disease mechanisms linking TBI to outcomes in clinical-epidemiologic studies. This training will
enable me to build an independent research program focused on vascular health in TBI with the goal of
elucidating disease mechanisms and characterizing TBI outcomes using well-designed prospective clinical-
epidemiologic studies of individuals with TBI. Completion of the proposed study will be facilitated by an
institutional environment that prioritizes collaboration and provides exemplary research and career support."

and held a leadership position in setting and evaluating national research guidelines for neuropathologic
evaluation of AD. We have banked over 800 tissue specimens, contributed data and biospecimens to local,
regional, national, and international research studies and consortia, and fostered development and
implementation of innovative technologies in translational research. Through the Core, we trained clinicians
and scientists from different disciplines in neuropathology and the molecular pathology of dementia-related
neurodegenerative diseases. The Neuropathology Core will pursue its mission through four Specific Aims. The
Core will provide comprehensive neuropathologic evaluations for physicians and researchers with timely and
comprehensive autopsy reports that describe the neuropathologic features of AD and related diseases
according to the most current guidelines and consensus diagnostic criteria. It will maintain and continue to
grow its highly accessible, but appropriately safeguarded, repository of brain tissue and biospecimens from
carefully and longitudinally characterized patients with cognitive impairment or dementia, as well as cognitively
normal individuals, using methods that increase and maximize tissue and data quality. In doing so, the Core
will empower innovative high-content imaging approaches for both formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
and for frozen brain regions to maximize the research value of the Stanford ADRC repository and other brain
banks around the country. Finally, we will maintain a rich training environment for medical and graduate
students, residents, fellows, and junior faculty across departments to teach concepts and state-of-the-art
techniques that advance current interdisciplinary research and foster future advances and insights in brain
aging and neurodegeneration. The Core is organized to maximize integration with all other Cores in the
Stanford ADRC. It also will continue to serve as a hub of support for affiliated ADRCs and independent
research awards through diagnostic practices, molecular assays, and tissue sharing. In doing so, the Core and
Center will continue to contribute nationally to advance our understanding of the pathologic features and
pathophysiologic processes of brain aging, all stages of AD, and related dementias."
10837697,"The goal of the Stanford ADRC Outreach, Recruitment and Engagement (ORE) Core is to advance research
and to enhance the public's understanding of dementia and how best to care for persons with dementia in the
various stages of the illness trajectory. We propose to educate and empower the populations we serve in
Stanford Medicine (including patients in Alameda, Campbell, Castro Valley, Oakland, Walnut Creek, Castro
Valley, Danville, Hayward, Pleasanton, San Jose, Berkeley, Livermore, Los Gatos, San Ramon, Walnut Creek,
Mountain View, Pleasanton, Fremont, Oakland) and our community partners. We also seek to identify, recruit,
enroll and retain research participants into the ADRC. Overall, the ORE Core is responsible for leading
recruitment and retention efforts of persons with dementia and their prodromal stages to support the Center's
local and national clinical research portfolio ranging from bench to the bedside. We are excited to collaborate
with the Clinical Core on participant recruitment and retention strategies and with the Research Education
Component and other ADRC cores to train and support the next generation of dementia researchers. Our
efforts specifically have a focus on the Hispanic/Latino-American community, the major underrepresented
racial/ethnic group in the region we serve. To accomplish these goals, the ORE Core team will continue to (i)
work closely with local organizations including the Bay Area chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association, the
Consulate General of Mexico in San Jose, local advocacy and faith-based organizations, and (ii) community
health organizational partners including the VA Palo Alto Health Care System and local federally qualified
health centers and county health organizations to a create a local network of partners to elevate the
importance and awareness of dementia as a public health crisis. In close partnership with our Community
Advisory Board, the ORE Core will continue culturally-humble and respectful outreach efforts to the community
and public through a bilingual newsletter, website, social media, television, radio, print news media, memory
screenings, talks, seminars, and participation at community events. The ORE Core will also develop novel
English and Spanish print materials and innovative courses and workshops for community health workers and
other paraprofessionals and the public that will lead to new participant referrals to our center by increasing
dementia awareness."
10837698,"1. SUMMARY (Biomarker Core)
Biomarkers have enormous value for the detection, management, and treatment of disease, but also for the
development of novel therapeutics. The utility of biomarkers is most evident in the management of
cardiovascular disease and diabetes, but biomarkers, especially predictive, easily obtainable ones, are still
largely absent with respect to neurodegenerative diseases. The best fluid biomarkers currently available for
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) include; Aβ, tau, and neurofilament in CSF, a biofluid which is difficult to collect in
healthy, at-risk populations or on a repeated basis. Other biomarkers for AD include imaging modalities which
are often very expensive or have low sensitivity and specificity at the individual level. The members of this core
have considerable experience in unbiased multi-omic screens and data analysis and, over the years, have
published numerous studies towards developing new biomarkers for neurodegenerative and other diseases.
Enabled by the current ADRC, the core leaders and collaborators have used biospecimens from Stanford
ADRC participants and generated extensive preliminary data with unbiased deep immune phenotyping,
proteomics, and transcriptomics of human CSF resident cells, and discovered novel Parkinson's disease (PD)
biomarkers. Based on this expertise, the mission of this Biomarker Core is to facilitate the discovery of novel
biomarkers for AD and PD, as well as new biology underlying the pathological processes that lead to dementia
in line with the core mission of the NAPA. This will be achieved by pursuing the collection of genetic and
molecular measurements from a broad source of tissues from ADRC participants; the processing and
dissemination of this information in useable formats through web portals and other means (i.e., “Deep
Phenotyping Database”); the analysis and bioinformatics integration of the collected information with clinical
and imaging data, as well as information from public databases; and the development and dissemination of
new data analysis algorithms and pipelines."
10837703,"1. Summary (Research Education Component)
As the population continues to age there will be an even higher percentage of individuals over 70 years of age
with a subsequent increasing percentage of individuals affected by aging-related diseases, such as
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders (ADRD). The Stanford Alzheimer's Disease Center (SADRC)
Research Education Component (REC) aims to provide training to the next generation of clinicians and
scientists in dementia-related research, ensuring a strong and diverse workforce prepared to respond to this
public-health crisis. The REC supports the vision of the SADRC to serve as a shared resource to facilitate and
enhance multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research in AD and ADRD. The REC will provide a
comprehensive and formalized training program to support 2-3 trainees per year to pursue research in and to
become leaders in the fields of aging, AD, and ADRDs. Along with the Leadership Team, the REC includes an
exceptional group of 28 mentors from 13 departments and programs at Stanford, who will serve as faculty to
the program participants. Formal didactics and coursework will complement clinical research training
opportunities and a research project leading to a manuscript and with the goal of submission of a Career
Development Award or Independent Research Award."
10837831,"Project 1 - Abstract
Chronic infections, such as HBV, HCV, HIV, Tb, malaria and others, are major causes of morbidity and mortality.
Recent advances in pharmacological and immunological treatments have revealed new opportunities to cure
some of these persisting infections. A single patient, Timothy Brown, cured of HIV using a bone marrow (BM)
transplant in 2008 is proof of concept that cure for HIV is possible. Subsequent trials using cellular therapies
demonstrated feasibility of such approaches, but no cures were achieved. Nevertheless, catalyzed in part by
these initial observations in HIV and by progress in immunotherapy of cancer, there are now considerable efforts
focused on adoptive cell therapies (ACT) for HIV. Despite major successes of ACT for some forms of cancer, a
major barrier to success for cancers and especially for HIV is T cell exhaustion. Indeed, when CAR T cells fail in
cancer patients, T cell exhaustion is a major underlying mechanism7-9 and T cell exhaustion is central to immune
failures in HIV control11,12,64. Thus, the central goal of Project 1 is to identify molecular pathways of T cell
exhaustion that can be targeted to improve the function and/or durability of T cells during cellular
therapy of chronic viral infection. Our goal is to identify mechanisms of T cell exhaustion that can be targeted
to improve function and durability of ACT for HIV. We will first test these ideas in a mouse model of chronic viral
infection and then move promising candidates to testing in HIV infected humanized mice while also dissecting
underlying molecular mechanisms. We will test the overall hypothesis that molecular pathways associated
with T cell exhaustion can be effectively targeted through genetic engineering to improve the next
generation of ACT approaches for HIV. We will test this hypothesis through the following Aims:
SA1. TO IDENTIFY AND TEST IN VIVO KEY GENES AND PATHWAYS THAT WILL IMPROVE THE FUNCTION AND/OR HOMING
OF T CELLS DURING ACT OF CHRONIC VIRAL INFECTION AND HIV. We hypothesize that pathways that regulate
effector function and/or homing can be targeted to improve T cell efficacy during ACT of chronic viral infection.
SA2. TO IDENTIFY AND TEST IN VIVO GENES AND PATHWAYS THAT WILL IMPROVE LONG-TERM DURABILITY,
DIFFERENTIATION AND RECALL CAPACITY OF T CELLS FOR ACT DURING CHRONIC VIRAL INFECTION AND HIV. We
hypothesize that specific persistence and/or memory related pathways that are defective in T cell exhaustion
can be targeted to improve the durability and effectiveness of ACT in chronic viral infection. Thus, the goal of
SA2 is to identify and target pathways that improve the optimal long-term persistence, differentiation and recall
capacity of T cells in ACT of chronic viral infection.
The long-term goal of Project 1 is to improve the next generation of CAR T cell therapies for HIV. The studies
proposed will not only identify important new targets for ACT of HIV and dissect underlying mechanisms, but will
also establish a platform for future efforts at improving cellular therapies based on preventing or reversing T cell
exhaustion."
10837840,"Project 4 - Abstract
The principle that adoptively transferred T lymphocytes have therapeutic promise for HIV infection
is well established. Our long range goals are to engineer T cells so that they can control HIV-1
replication in the absence of HAART. Our companies’ scientific founders have pioneered the use
of cell and gene therapy to treat HIV-1, and we will use this expertise to better study the
relationship between T cells that have been rendered resistant to HIV-1 infection and specific for
HIV to control of HIV-1 replication in the absence of ART. Our project serves as a main integration
site for this U19 consortium as the most promising approaches generated by Projects 1-3 will be
incorporated into Phase I clinical trial that we design, execute and analysis. Additionally, we will
develop a commercial T cell manufacturing platform that will give HIV infected individuals access
to Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) therapy. The specific aims of this Project are: 1) Define the
optimal method to expand T cells for HIV cure studies: Using Tmunity’s T cell expansion expertise
and proprietary technology, we will systematically address the best media, artificial APC, and
manufacturing platform to develop an optimized protocol to expand highly functional T cells with
superior engraftment potential to be used as part of HIV cure regimens. 2) Design and
implement a Phase I clinical trial to test the ability of engineered T cells to prevent viral
rebound during an analytical treatment interruption: With input from the members of this U19,
scientific advisory board (SAB) and NIH program officers, we will plan and execute a Phase I
clinical trial that uses this new manufacturing protocol established in Aim 1. 3) Perform
correlative studies on samples collected in Aim 2 to develop testable hypotheses that
could improve adoptive T cell therapy for HIV infection: Using banked cells collected from
informative time points, we will perform validated assays that examine T cell function and
persistence and the ability of the chosen intervention to control HIV replication in the absence of
ART."

Project 4. Defining the Role of EBV in DLBCL Pathogenesis and Identification of Therapeutic Targets
Eric Johannsen, Project Leader; Shannon Kenney and Bill Sugden, Co-Leaders
People living with HIV are at substantially increased risk of developing diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL),
the most prevalent aggressive B cell lymphoma. DLBCL is not a single disease, but a group of histologically
similar, but genetically distinct cancers. Defining DLBCL subtypes has shown distinct molecular pathways drive
each subtype and has led to improvements in therapy. Although 5-10% of DLBCLs are EBV+, we lack an
understanding of whether EBV associates with any of these genetic subtypes or is a distinct entity. We have
discovered that about one-third of EBV+ DLBCLs correspond to the BCL6+Notch2 (BN2) DLBCL subtype and
the remaining two-thirds fall outside of current DLBCL genetic classification. This project will: (1) fully define the
genetic subtype(s) of DLBCL, including BN2, that are EBV associated; (2) determine the molecular mechanisms
by which EBV latent genes interact with BN2 associated driver mutations to cause DLBCL; and (3) define the
role of EBV in DLBCL and identify dependency factors in EBV+ DLBCL that can be targeted therapeutically."

JC polyomavirus (JCPyV), a ubiquitous human pathogen, causes several devastating brain diseases in
immune compromised individuals. The most notable of these JCPyV-associated CNS diseases is the
frequently fatal demyelinating brain disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML, an
AIDS-defining lesion in the pre-cART epoch, has emerged as a life-threatening complication in patients
receiving immunomodulatory agents for autoimmune and inflammatory disorders and treatment for certain
hematological malignancies. Among the rapidly expanding list of PML-associated biologics, natalizumab
(Tysabri®) has the highest incidence and is an ominous sequela for multiple sclerosis (MS) patients who
otherwise benefit from dramatic reductions in relapses using this immunomodulatory agent. Drug withdrawal,
the only therapeutic option for PML, is often complicated by a high-mortality cerebral inflammatory reaction. No
anti-JCPyV agents are available. Polyomaviruses are species-specific. Lack of a tractable animal model of
polyomavirus-induced CNS disease is an acknowledged bottleneck to elucidating PML pathogenesis, the
immunological mechanisms that control JCPyV, in vivo evaluation of agents that inhibit polyomavirus
replication in tissue culture, and uncovering early events that presage irreversible JCPyV-associated
neuropathology. Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we developed a natural virus-host model of
polyomavirus-associated CNS disease. In this R35 application, we plan to leverage our three recent key
findings: (1) Mapping JCPyV-PML VP1 capsid protein mutations to MuPyV’s VP1 confers escape from virus-
neutralizing antibodies (nAb) while preserving CNS tropism; (2) IL-21 produced by high-affinity anti-MuPyV
CD4 T cells in the brain is required for formation and maintenance of MuPyV-specific brain resident-memory
CD8 T cells (bTRM); and (3) STAT1-dependent innate immunity limits infection of the ventricular ependyma, a
critical barrier to infection of the brain parenchyma. These findings lay the foundation for three key questions to
be addressed here: (1) Is the ependyma the staging ground for polyomavirus invasion of the brain
parenchyma?; (2) Does the integrity of the CD8 bTRM response to persistent infection depend on subset
heterogeneity?; and (3) Does T cell deficiency open the door for outgrowth of nAb-escape virus variants? The
proposed studies will make use of cutting edge advances in next-generation sequencing to uncover rare VP1
mutations in vivo, custom cryo EM image reconstruction approaches to define endogenous VP1 nAb epitopes
and nAb escape mechanisms, and high-resolution 3D imaging of intact mouse brains to visualize virus CNS
entry and spread. Findings from these studies will answer fundamental questions about innate and adaptive
immune control of polyomavirus CNS infection and conditions underlying dissemination of virus from the
periphery into the brain before development of irreversible neuropathology."

10840377,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A growing body of evidence demonstrates the presence of racial bias in data algorithms. In healthcare, racial
bias could arise due to systematic biases in classification and coding, data availability, or data accuracies that
differ across racial groups. For instance, algorithms that use data on healthcare costs—rather than illness—to
predict need tend to allocate too few resources to Black patients who are underserved by our current system
and generate lower spending than white patients with the same health conditions. This issue is increasingly
relevant because most U.S. public health insurance programs operate capitated managed care systems, in
which beneficiaries enroll in private insurance plans, and the government pays insurers a fixed monthly
capitation payment per enrollee. These per-capita payments are typically calculated using risk-adjustment
algorithms, in which patient costs are predicted with information on age, gender, and selected health conditions
from data on past enrollees. However, race is often excluded from these algorithms, raising the possibility that
risk-adjusted managed care could widen racial disparities in care and outcomes among patients. Yet there is
little empirical evidence on the impacts of risk-adjusted managed care systems on racial differences in care
and health outcomes, especially in high-cost settings, such as long-term care. This project will advance
knowledge on these issues by studying the causal effects of risk-adjusted managed long-term care (MLTC) on
racial disparities in care and outcomes among dual-eligible Medicare/Medicaid long-term care beneficiaries in
New York, using 8 years of administrative data on Medicaid and Medicare enrollment, claims, and assessment
records. The project will identify the effects of risk-adjusted MLTC on a range of care utilization and health
outcomes, including inpatient, post-acute, nursing home, and at-home care, prescription drug use, and
mortality, separately by patient race/ethnicity. Leveraging the county-by-county rollout of managed care
mandates, the analysis will use difference-in-differences models to compare within-county changes in
outcomes of patients in New York from before to after managed care was implemented. We will estimate
separate models by race/ethnicity of the patient, testing for statistical differences in MLTC effects. The project
will also identify subgroups who are most severely affected by racial bias in risk-adjustment algorithms, through
sub-group analyses that compare effects by gender, age, presence of chronic conditions, and zip code level
median income. The project will additionally examine the role of managed care plan features in driving racial
disparities in health care utilization and health outcomes. Results will help policymakers, healthcare
organizations, providers, and patients to understand the implications of bias in risk-adjustment algorithms on
patient health, identify subgroups of patients who are most severely impacted, and learn about effective plan
features that could curb or eliminate racial health disparities in managed care settings."

In the United States, it is estimated that more than 9% of people living with HIV acquired the virus through
injection of substances or substance abuse-related sexual contact. Although substance use is well known
to exacerbate HIV-associated neurotoxicity, there is no prompt treatment for alleviating neurocognitive
dysfunctions in HIV-positive individuals. Our proposal is based on significant discoveries regarding the
impact of chronic METH and HIV on the neurogenic niche, such as (i) HIV can infect the neural progenitor
cells (NPCs) in subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle in mouse brain; (ii) chronic METH and HIV
changes microRNA (miRNA) profiles of ex vivo NPCs; and (iii) METH and HIV-disrupted blood-brain barrier
(BBB) integrity increases brain inflammation, but it does not stimulate the migration of NPCs in that lesion.
The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate a novel mechanism linking the BBB pericytes and NPCs
in chronic METH and HIV-induced alterations of NPC migration mediated by miRNAs. In order to evaluate
this hypothesis, our transdisciplinary study will focus on the role of miR-21-5p, whose expression is
significantly reduced in METH and HIV-exposed mouse SVZ NPCs and plasma samples, in the alteration of
SVZ NPCs migration (Aim 1), and the crosstalk between the BBB pericytes and NPCs in response to METH
exposure and HIV infection in the brain (Aim 2). We anticipate that this proposed research will
demonstrate the potential of restoring the NPC migration to combat the neurotoxic effects of METH and
HIV, ultimately improving neurocognitive function by enhancing adult neurogenesis.
The focus on the interaction between the brain microvasculature and NPC migration, which influences
the development of neurocognitive dysfunctions following chronic METH exposure and HIV infection, is
an innovative and cutting-edge conceptual approach. Moreover, given the growing evidence linking
miRNA expression alterations to substance abuse and HIV infection, studying the role of miRNAs in METH
and HIV-induced altered neurogenesis is crucial and provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms
of neurotoxicity and potential therapeutic targets."

A complex interplay exists between the human microbiome and the host, resulting in clear effects on
human physiology and microbiome ecology. A promising avenue to dissect this interplay at a
mechanistic level is through the study of microbiome-derived molecules that mediate important
microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions. In this application, we propose a hybrid computational-
synthetic biology approach to discover, rationally prioritize and systematically characterize microbiome-
derived molecules. We propose to apply this approach to three structurally diverse classes of bioactive
molecules that are widely encoded by the human microbiome but remain severely understudied in
terms of both structure and function. First, guided by the computational analysis of biosynthetic gene
clusters in metagenomic sequencing data from the human microbiome of thousands of subjects, we
will select specific members of the three molecular classes for experimental characterization. Second,
we will use genome editing of native members of the microbiome and synthetic biology in a multi-host
heterologous expression platform to characterize the selected pathways and their products. Finally, we
will employ an array of in vitro, cell-based and mouse colonization assays to interrogate the role of the
discovered molecules in mediating relevant host and microbiome functions. Taken together, our
approach will unveil an undermined section of the interplay between the human microbiome and the
host and provide diverse microbiome-derived bioactive molecules as tools for future mechanistic

Primary high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing has become first line screening for cervical cancer in
high-income countries. The feasibility of this approach in low- and middle-income countries is less clear, as is
the role of primary HPV screening among women living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Evaluating
the performance of cervical cancer screening algorithms using primary HPV testing in high HIV prevalence
settings like Botswana is essential for establishing an evidence-based strategy for cervical cancer screening in
populations with a high burden of HIV living in low- and middle-income countries. The proposed study
evaluates innovative HPV-based cervical cancer screening algorithms in women living with HIV (WLHIV) and
builds a longitudinal cohort to evaluate long-term outcomes. With internal departmental funding, I have begun
recruitment of a cohort of 3,000 women, 50% of whom are living with HIV, in South East District, Botswana.
Participants in this cohort undergo baseline cervical cancer screening with high-risk HPV testing and 3 types of
visual triage evaluation: 1) visual assessment with acetic acid, 2) colposcopy, and 3) automated visual
evaluation. Biopsy with histopathology is collected as the gold standard in comparing the efficacy of these
HPV-based screening algorithms. Excisional treatment is offered as indicated by colposcopy and biopsy
results. Aim 1 of the proposed K08 will evaluate the performance of these HPV-based screening algorithms, as
well as HPV testing alone in detecting cervical dysplasia in WLHIV. Additionally, in Aim 2, I will conduct interval
HPV-based cervical cancer screening for the WLHIV in this cohort to evaluate safe and effective screening
intervals. Specifically, I will repeat HPV testing at 2 years in WLHIV who tested positive for HPV and had
benign pathology at baseline, and at 3 years in WLHIV who tested negative for HPV at baseline. Women will
undergo triage testing according to the findings of the baseline screening study. Based on the data from
baseline and interval screening, in Aim 3, I will develop a pilot implementation study to evaluate the
incorporation of HPV-based cervical cancer screening into routine health services, in collaboration with the
Ministry of Health and Wellness of Botswana. This K08 will provide protected research time and build skills in
advanced clinical data analytics, clinical trial design, and implementation science to become an independent
NIH-funded researcher. My career goal is to improve the health and wellness of women through evaluation and
implementation of high-performance cervical cancer screening that is within reach of all women regardless of
their geography and socioeconomic status. The research will be conducted with the support of the Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center and through the Botswana Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership with which the PI
has a long-standing research appointment. Furthermore, this research will be done in collaboration with the
Ministry of Health and Wellness of Botswana, thus impacting national cervical cancer screening policy as well
as international policy for WLHIV."

 This K23 application proposes novel research in opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment in a correctional
healthcare setting and a robust training plan to support the successful transition of the Dr. Justin Berk, MD
MPH MBA (PI) to independent clinician-scientist. His background in public health, health management, and
clinical medicine creates a strong foundation for further development as an expert scientist. He has assembled
a highly accomplished and diverse team of nationally recognized mentors and advisors with complementary
expertise in clinical trials and other research among vulnerable populations including qualitative methodologies
and implementation science. The proposed research work will provide hands-on experience instrumental to Dr.
Berk’s career progression as a clinical trialist preliminary data for a future multi-site R01 application. The
Rhode Island Department of Corrections (RIDOC) is an ideal setting for this type of pilot study.
 Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are an effective treatment in the community and among
incarcerated individuals. Given the high prevalence OUD in jails and prisons and the high risk of opioid
overdose upon release, the criminal justice (CJ) system offers a targeted opportunity to engage individuals in
treatment initiation. Despite the strong evidence-base for MOUD, few correctional facilities offer these life-
saving medications. A shifting policy landscape in legislation and court rulings will lead to more facilities
offering MOUD treatment. Delivery barriers, however, still exist. A new injectable extended-release form of
buprenorphine (XR-B) can help overcome these barriers, though there is no published literature on its
effectiveness or implementation in a CJ setting. This K23 proposes a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to
demonstrate preliminary effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of XR-B and uses a concomitant process
evaluation, with frameworks frequently used in implementation science, to investigate how this novel treatment
modality may be used in a CJ setting to prevent opioid overdose in the high-risk time of re-entry to the
community.
 The specific aims of this K23 proposal include: (Aim 1) Compare XR-B initiation to treatment-as-usual
sublingual buprenorphine among incarcerated individuals on treatment engagement, re-incarceration,
overdose, buprenorphine adherence, and illicit opioid use. (Aim 2) Conduct a process evaluation using the RE-
AIM evaluative framework and iPARIHS implementation science framework to assess the implementation of
XR-B initiation and identify facilitators to and barriers of MOUD treatment in a CJ setting.
 In order to achieve these aims and move towards research independence, Dr. Berk will receive training
and experience in clinical trial research, including supporting qualitative methodologies and implementation
science, and build a career to conduct high-impact and ethical research in a marginalized population."
10840337,"PROJECT ABSTRACT:
Nurses spend an average of one-third of their patient care time interacting with the electronic health record
(EHR), and high nursing workloads can lead to missed nursing care essential for patient safety and quality of
care, and increase the odds of medication errors, which can be deadly. However, there has been a lack of
studies of EHR burden on nurses, even though over 90% were dissatisfied with inpatient EHR use, burden,
time demands, and had doubts about EHR impact on patient care quality and safety. This indicates a critical
need to comprehensively examine EHR usability and usefulness and to develop effective, well thought out
solutions using a human factors and systems engineering approach. However, the limited studies typically
examine a single aspect of usability/usefulness, and very few link nurse EHR to patient safety and quality
outcomes. To address these research gaps, we propose a 5-year, prospective, multi-site, mixed-method field
study with the following aims: 1-to understand and comprehensively evaluate nurse EHR usability and
usefulness, using micro- and macro-level measures, that include process mapping of nurse EHR clinical
workflow, EHR data analytics (e.g., EPIC reports-time stamps, task/page sequencing), structured interviews,
targeted observations and nurse surveys, with consideration of EHR structure (functionality, interoperability); 2-
to measure real-time usability with mobile monitoring (via eye-tracking glasses) with time-stamped EPIC
reports, followed by cognitive interviews post-monitoring to obtain details on EHR challenges and flow
decisions; 3- to examine the impact of EHR usability and usefulness on nurse-perceived patient safety (missed
nursing care, medication errors), accounting for various dimensions of nursing workload (e.g., cognitive,

Dysregulation of glucose and lipid metabolism are central features of human aging and play major roles in the
highly morbid cardiometabolic conditions prevalent among older adults, including cardiovascular disease,
diabetes, and congestive heart failure. Non-esterified, or free, fatty acids (NEFAs) have long been implicated
as central actors in impaired metabolism and may underlie many of the adverse effects of metabolic aging,
including cognitive decline and frailty.
Dr. Kenneth Mukamal, a general internist, has undertaken broad-based epidemiological research with a
particular focus on metabolic determinants of cardiovascular and cognitive outcomes among older adults. This
research has largely centered on the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), an NHLBI- and NIA-funded cohort
study of 5,888 adults aged 65 and older from four U.S. communities, and the Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory
Study (GEMS), a randomized trial that conducted additional dementia follow-up in a subset of CHS
participants. Dr. Mukamal serves as a member of the CHS Steering Committee and chairs its Diabetes
Working Group. Dr. Mukamal’s ongoing research support (R01-AG-053325) funds measurement of total,
individual and post-glucose-load NEFAs in the unique CHS cohort. His recent work has demonstrated that
total NEFAs are associated with cognitive decline and adjudicated dementia in CHS. Supported by two recent
supplements – one to support an underrepresented minority scientist whom Dr. Mukamal mentors and a
second to support ADRD research in response to NOT-AG-18-008 – Dr. Mukamal is now actively investigating
the role of individual and post-load NEFAs in dementia and frailty in CHS and elsewhere.
Dr. Mukamal has a long, consistent, and distinguished track record of mentoring young scientists, serving in
major educational roles across a variety of settings and having received formal recognition for his outstanding
research mentorship. A Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research would enable him to
expand and deepen his commitment to mentoring by reducing his administrative responsibilities and providing
direct support for focused, intensive mentoring activities that specifically relate to metabolic impairment in
aging. In addition, this award would enable Dr. Mukamal to further develop his own career and gain
knowledge, familiarity, and expertise in domains crucial to the further extension of his work into dementia, such
as advances in cognitive assessment and neuroimaging. In conjunction with the outstanding environments for
training and mentoring at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, and the Harvard TH
Chan School of Public Health, this award will enable Dr. Mukamal to expand and improve his mentoring
experience and, as a result, help to train the next generation of investigators in metabolic aging."

 Spatial control of membrane traffic is essential for the morphogenesis and maintenance of polarized
cell types such as epithelia and neurons, and their physiological functions in tissue homeostasis and
neurotransmission. Loss of cell polarity and defects in membrane traffic underlie the pathogenesis of many
diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration and metabolic disorders. The RATIONALE for our studies is that
a mechanistic knowledge of the spatial organization and regulation of membrane traffic is critical for the design
of new treatments and regenerative therapies. Many advances have been made in understanding membrane
traffic at points of origin (protein sorting, vesicle formation) and destination (vesicle docking/fusion). However,
KEY CHALLENGES remain in understanding how long-range transport is spatially controlled en route to
destination. Our CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS is that septins, a unique family of GTP-binding proteins that
associate with distinct subsets of microtubules (MTs) and membrane domains, comprise a novel regulatory
module for the spatial guidance of membrane traffic. Recent findings from our laboratory show that septins
modulate motor (kinesins, dynein) interactions with MTs and membranes. Driven by these advances, we will
address KEY QUESTIONS about septin functions and the spatial control of membrane traffic in epithelia and
neurons. We will investigate whether there is specificity between septins and distinct routes of polarized traffic
(e.g., apical vs. basolateral). We will distinguish between septin roles in the spatial orientation of MTs and the
modulation of motor motility on MT tracks, which will be mechanistically studied with structure-function
approaches. Based on new evidence of septin association with endolysosomes, we will investigate how
lysosome trafficking and positioning is regulated by septins. We will test the hypothesis that endolysosomal
septins scaffold the recruitment and activation of dynein-dynactin, and examine whether septins are involved in
the coordination of kinesin and dynein motors. Lastly, we will investigate how septin association with MTs or
membranes is controlled, focusing on phosphorylation of septins by signaling kinases as a switch mechanism
between MT- and membrane-associated functions. We will pursue these projects using innovative tools and
cutting-edge approaches including in vitro reconstitution, single-molecule and super-resolution microscopy,
and 3D organoid culture. Outcomes will provide new insights into the mechanisms that direct the transport of
membrane vesicles and endolysosomes in response to morphogenetic and metabolic signals. The proposed
studies will also advance our understanding of septins as spatial regulators of intracellular organization,
bearing significance on diseases triggered and/or exacerbated by abnormalities in septin expression."
10851994,"Children are not small adults; yet we heavily rely on information collected in randomized and
non-randomized studies in adult populations to inform treatment strategies for pediatric patients.
Historically, children have been protected from research for ethical reasons. However, this well-
intentioned protection from the risks and burdens of trials has paradoxically left children more
susceptible to the potential risks of drugs used in everyday practice, frequently off-label and
without high-quality evidence of efficacy, effectiveness, or safety. The importance of
pharmacoepidemiologic drug safety monitoring using routinely collected healthcare data has
been increasingly recognized by the FDA, EMA, and other regulators, and forms the backbone
for a major component of the nation’s drug safety surveillance system. However, to date, the
focus of these initiatives has been on drug safety in adult populations; there is currently no
systematic surveillance system targeting drug safety in pediatric populations. To address this
evidence gap – which puts pediatric patients at increased risk – we propose to develop and test
the performance of TreeScan based approaches for the systematic and simultaneous
evaluation of multiple potential adverse outcomes in pediatric populations, and to implement
these methods for prospective sequential surveillance of new pediatric medications. TreeScan
methods use a hierarchical tree comprising thousands of outcomes and account for multiple
testing of correlated hypotheses while systematically screening for potential adverse effects.
The methodology has never been used to evaluate drug safety in pediatric patients, where there
are unique challenges compared to adult populations. Thus, the methods require further
development and refinement. We will test the approach based on real-world examples of
established drugs with relatively well characterized safety profiles (Aim 1) as well as plasmode
simulations that explore a broad range of plausible clinical contexts in pediatrics (Aim 2). The
performance tested approach will then be implemented to prospectively monitor the safety of
recently approved drugs and new drugs that will be approved during the early years of the grant
(Aim 3). Potential signals will be further evaluated in full-scale epidemiological studies. This
project will provide a critically needed tool that could lead to early detection of unsuspected
adverse effects of drugs in pediatric populations if they exist and provide reassurance if no
safety issues with large effects are detected. The proposed studies are expected to have an
immediate and important public health impact by providing comprehensive assessments of the
safety profiles for new medications in pediatric populations."
10851995,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Informal caregivers (ICs) of patients with cancer, who play an increasingly crucial role in the healthcare
system, are at significant risk for severe and persistent anxiety and depression, even higher than levels
reported by the patients for whom they provide care. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has demonstrated
robust efficacy for clinical anxiety and depression for individuals in the general population, but CBTs adapted
for cancer ICs evidence comparatively unsatisfying outcomes. One possible explanation for this lackluster
efficacy is that these CBTs do not comprehensively target the factors that typically comprise the distress
commonly experienced by ICs, such as attentional rigidity and perseverative negative thinking (PNT; e.g.,
worry and rumination). Emotion Regulation Therapy (ERT) is a contemporary CBT intervention developed to
deliberately target processes underlying the distress associated with caregiving. ERT has established efficacy
and initial support for proposed mechanisms in a series of trials for chronic anxiety and depression and is a
promising candidate intervention to address the mechanisms likely complicating the resolution of IC anxiety
and depression. Predicated on ERT, we developed Emotion Regulation Therapy for Cancer Caregivers (ERT-
C) and demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy in reducing depression and anxiety
symptoms, PNT and emotion regulation deficits, and improving the quality of life of patients for whom ICs
enrolled in ERT-C provided care. In this application, we propose to more stringently evaluate the efficacy of
ERT-C and elucidate hypothesized mechanisms underlying reductions in distress. Through a multi-site trial, we
will randomize 200 ICs to 8 sessions each of ERT-C or traditional CBT to evaluate primary and secondary
outcomes at baseline, post-treatment, and at 3-and 6-months follow-up. Patient outcomes will also be collected
at baseline and 3-months follow-up. We predict that ERT-C will be associated with superior anxiety and
depression reductions in ICs and QOL in patients, with advantages maintained six months following treatment.
Secondarily, we predict that ERT will produce greater gains in adaptive emotion regulation capacity and that
these skills will partially mediate reductions in depression and anxiety symptoms. We will additionally examine
the relative change in salivary markers of stress (e.g., diurnal cortisol) and inflammation (i.e., soluble tumor
necrosis factor-alpha receptor II, CRP, Interleukin 6) in ICs receiving ERT-C versus CBT and predict that ERT-
C will result in greater reductions in cortisol dysregulation and systemic inflammation as compared to CBT, and
these gains will be maintained at 6-months follow-up. Our results will advance the science of IC intervention
research by addressing a critical gap in our field’s ability to powerfully, quickly and effectively address IC
anxiety and depression."
10851996,"ABSTRACT
Infections by parasites of the genus Plasmodium cause more than 200 million cases of malaria and kill more
than 400,000 people annually, most of whom are Plasmodium falciparum-infected children in sub-Saharan
Africa. The majority of P. falciparum infections are asymptomatic. While some infections progress to clinical
uncomplicated malaria (UM), a small percentage of infections progress to clinical forms of severe malaria (e.g.,
severe malarial anemia (SMA), cerebral malaria (CM)), which are responsible for P. falciparum related deaths.
To date, it is not fully understood what factors contribute towards the susceptibility of P. falciparum infection
progressing to clinical UM or severe malaria. Gut microbiota provide many benefits to the host, including
modulation of host immunity. In a murine model system, we recently published that mice with distinct gut
bacterial communities exhibit differences in the severity of malaria and humoral immunity following infection.
Mice with a specific bacterial community profile developed relatively low parasitemia following Plasmodium
yoelii infection and exhibited elevated T follicular helper (Tfh) and germinal center (GC) B cell numbers and
accelerated antibody class switching compared to mice with a different bacterial community profile that
developed high parasitemia. When mice that develop low parasitemia were treated with antibodies that disrupt
Tfh-GC B cell communication, they had similarly high parasite burdens as control mice. These findings suggest
that microbiome-mediated modulation of the GC reaction may be a mechanism underlying the development of
severe malaria. Currently, there are no definitive human data on the effect of the gut microbiome on the
progression of P. falciparum infection to clinical malaria. Of note, our preliminary data demonstrate that
children with asymptomatic parasitemia (AP) infections have different stool bacteria communities than children
with SMA, and prospective analysis of stool bacteria in Malian children has identified significant differences
between children who maintain or control AP infection versus children who develop febrile malaria. These
novel findings support the central hypothesis that the composition of gut microbiota in humans is a risk factor
for developing clinical malaria through modulation of GC reactions. Our hypothesis will be tested through the
following specific aims: Aim 1. Demonstrate the human gut microbiome is capable of causing differential
susceptibility to malaria. Aim 2. Determine the role of human gut microbiota in modulating GC reactions
following Plasmodium infection."

Increased total serum IgE levels are associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the causal role
of antigen-specific IgE in CAD remains largely unexplored. Recent work from our group and others provide
evidence that humans with IgE sensitization to the mammalian oligosaccharide allergen α-gal have larger
coronary artery plaques and unstable plaque features signifying increased CAD compared to those without IgE
to α-gal. Yet, whether IgE to α-gal directly promotes atherosclerotic plaque development and the molecular
and cellular mechanisms mediating IgE sensitization to α-gal linked to atherosclerosis formation are unknown.
Bites from the lone star tick induce IgE sensitization to α-gal and a subsequent severe allergic response when
the subject ingests α-gal-containing foods such as red meat. However, the vast majority of individuals with IgE
to α-gal do not manifest with delayed anaphylaxis and frequently have no outward identifying symptoms. As
such, they continue to consume α-gal-containing food products (meat, dairy, etc.) which have the capacity to
continue to stimulate IgE responses and inflammation in the vessel wall. Preliminary data provide the first
evidence that humans with IgE sensitization to α-gal had a higher frequency of CCR6+ switched memory
(SWM) B cells. Notably, consistent with the association of the IgE sensitization to α-gal and CAD, the amount
of CCR6 on SWM B cells was associated with CAD severity. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that
CCR6+ SWM B cells expressed higher IL-4R and STAT6 in subjects that were IgE α-gal+ compared to IgE α-
gal-. Interestingly, IL-4 and STAT6 are important for B cell class switch recombination to IgE, suggesting that
cells that make IL-4 may be important in IgE α-gal production. Studying IgE sensitization to α-gal in
conventional murine models of atherosclerosis is not feasible as mice, like all lower mammals but unlike
humans, express the enzyme galactosyltransferase, produce α-gal and do not develop an IgE response to α-
gal. We have obtained a novel α-gal-/- mouse that mimics the human condition to study the role of IgE
sensitization to α-gal in atherosclerosis. Comparing α-gal-/- mice to mice wildtype (WT) for α-gal, we show a
significant induction of IgE to α-gal after exposure to lone star tick-derived lipids in the α-gal-/- but not the WT
mouse. Moreover, preliminary data from mice deficient in NKT cells implicates iNKT cells in the regulation of
IgE antibody production to lipids from lone star ticks. Based on these human and murine data, the overarching
objective of this proposal is to investigate whether these factors and cells play a causal role in atherosclerosis
development due to IgE sensitization to α-gal. We will use loss and gain of function studies in murine
atherosclerosis models to define novel mechanisms of α-gal IgE production and the impact of tick-induced α-
gal sensitization on diet-induced atherosclerosis, and test a larger cohort of humans with CAD qualitatively and
quantitatively by intravascular ultrasound virtual histology (IVUS-VH), allowing for more robust multivariate
analysis and deeper interrogation of immune cell phenotypes that mark those at greatest risk."

The long-standing Neuroscience Training Program (NTP) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison provides multi-
disciplinary, predoctoral graduate training in the neurosciences. The overarching goal of the program is to train
the next generation of leading integrative neuroscientists for careers in academia, healthcare, teaching, industry,
and public service. Graduate students in our program receive comprehensive, interdisciplinary research training
with internationally recognized faculty whose research interests span the breadth of modern neuroscience.
Indeed, students receive training in a broad range of neuroscience areas including: cellular and molecular
neuroscience; membrane excitability and synaptic transmission; neural circuits; systems and computational
neuroscience; perception and action; behavior, cognition, and emotion; development, plasticity, and repair; and
the neurobiology of disease. The proposed renewal of the T32 training grant includes a combination of hands-
on research, coursework, individual development plans (IDPs) and mentoring training, and a unique seminar
course. The NTP curriculum is designed to provide rigorous training that emphasizes sound scientific reasoning,
experimental design for neuroscience studies, as well as quantitative skills and statistical methodology taught
by NTP Faculty Trainers using neuroscience examples selected for their pedagogical value. Importantly, training
in responsible conduct of research (RCR) as well as rigor and reproducibility occurs throughout the entire training
period. The NTP Faculty Trainers include 93 members drawn from 24 departments. To student training, they
contribute expertise across a wide array of neuroscience subdisciplines and state-of-the-art methodologies
ranging from molecular genetics/proteomics to whole brain neuroimaging. New initiatives include expanded
mentorship training for our faculty and students; improved, student-tailored IDPs; and increased quantitative and
computational training. Newly focused efforts related to diversity and equity will emphasize recruitment and
retention of underrepresented minority (URM) students. These efforts will collectively advance the NTP’s goal of
fostering an environment of interdisciplinary neuroscience training that provides students with the intellectual
and experiential breadth necessary to advance biological and biomedical research as leaders in the field of
neuroscience. Our program has been particularly successful in achieving its training goals. Over the past 10
years, the average time to PhD was 5.19 years, the average number of first-author papers was 2.16, and the
average number of total papers was 5. Of our graduates 10-20 years post-degree, 34% hold tenure-track faculty
positions. We anticipate appointing 12 new T32 trainees per year. Selection of trainees will be based principally
upon prior academic and research accomplishments as well as demonstrated potential for an independent
research career. Graduates will be well-equipped to carry out research aimed at understanding fundamental
neurobiological processes as well as mechanisms underlying diseases and disorders of the nervous system,
and to train future generations of neuroscientists."

10852832,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Large scale sequencing efforts have comprehensively defined the genomic landscape of localized and
metastatic prostate cancer, yielding an improved understanding of drivers of disease initiation and progression
and greater insight into mechanisms of resistance to androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibition. One limitation
of this “tumor cell focused” genomic approach is a relative lack of insight into how the tumor microenvironment
(TME) plays a role. However, recent advances in single cell sequencing technologies have opened the door to
comprehensively examine tumor/microenvironment interactions with unprecedented precision. Our group has
embraced this approach: initially to characterize epithelial/stromal interactions in the normal prostate, and now
to delineate tumor cell/microenvironment interactions in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of
prostate cancer. These studies reveal a striking level of complexity. We have not only defined previously
unknown subpopulations of luminal epithelial and stromal cells in the normal prostate gland, but also we have
shown how these populations change/evolve during progression to invasive disease and in response to AR
pathway inhibition (i.e. castration). In addition, our preliminary data showing that depletion of tumor-infiltrating
immune cells delays disease progression eliminates any doubt that these TME changes are secondary
phenomena.
 Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the prostate TME (immune cells and stromal cells) plays a
crucial role in disease progression. We will explore this hypothesis through three synergistic specific aims that:
(i) address the mechanism by which tumor infiltrating immune cells enhance tumor progression; (ii) elucidate
how changes in Wnt pathway signaling in prostate stroma promote invasion by tumor epithelium; and (iii)
determine whether/how the response of prostate tumors to AR pathway inhibition is influenced by inhibition of
AR in the surrounding TME cells. We have extensive experience with the GEMMs, tissue recombination assays
and organoid culture that will be used to address these questions. We also have a strong track record of
translating laboratory findings to the clinic, which will ensure the human relevance of our findings. Finally, this
project is highly integrated with all other components of this program project: through collaborative interactions
with the Shen lab in analyzing the transition to neuroendocrine disease, with the Abate-Shen lab in studies of
Wnt pathway signaling in bone metastasis, with Core A for analysis of human tissue samples and with Core B
for statistical support and data management."
10852836,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The objective of our research is to elucidate tumor cell intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that give rise
to bone metastasis and specify bone tropism. The foundation for our studies is the NPKYPF mouse model, which
develops highly penetrant bone metastasis that is well-conserved with bone metastasis in human prostate
cancer. Analyses of these mice enable investigations of the evolution of bone metastases during cancer
progression in the native microenvironment in androgen-intact and androgen-deprived contexts. We have found
that co-activation of MYC and RAS signaling is essential for bone metastasis, and that MYC activation is
particularly relevant in contexts of androgen deprivation. Our preliminary studies have identified ATAD2 as a
MYC-co-factor that is expressed in bone metastasis, particularly in contexts of androgen deprivation, and
necessary for bone metastasis. In a complementary genome-wide in vivo CRISPR screening based on human
prostate cancer xenografts, we identified CITED2, another MYC co-factor, as a cell-intrinsic driver of bone
metastasis that it is sufficient to promote bone metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, single cell sequencing of primary
tumors and bone metastases from NPKYPF mice has led to the identification master regulators (MRs) that are
candidate cell intrinsic drivers of bone metastasis, while analyses of the non-tumor components have shown that
primary tumors from metastatic NPKYPF mice are deficient for most immune cell populations, but highly enriched
for tumor associated macrophages.
 Thus, we will investigate the hypothesis that bone metastasis represents the culmination of cell intrinsic
drivers from the metastatic cells and tumor cell extrinsic factors in microenvironment of the metastatic bone. In
Aim 1, we will investigate the hypothesis that CITED2 collaborates with MYC to promote bone specificity. In
parallel, we will investigate candidate master regulators (MRs) associated with RAS pathway activation to
elucidate their potential roles in bone metastasis. In Aim 2, we will investigate the hypothesis that ATAD2 is a
co-factor for MYC in contexts of androgen deprivation, and elucidate the relationship of androgen status for the
evolution and underlying mechanisms of bone metastasis. In Aim 3, we will investigate cell extrinsic mechanisms
in the microenvironment of the primary tumor and metastatic bone, to identify relevant cell populations associated
with metastasis, to evaluate their functional role for bone metastasis, and to identify cell extrinsic drivers of bone
metastasis.
Integration: Our studies are highly complementary to investigations of the tumor microenvironment for
neuroendocrine differentiation (Project 3) and tumor progression (Project 1). Validation of candidate regulators
for human bone metastasis will require Core A. Further, our systematic analysis of bone metastasis at the single
cell level, complement efforts in Projects 1 and 3, while our ability to mutually benefit from these data will be
enabled by the data management component of Core B."
10852902,"Youth violence victimization is common and increases risk for a host of negative health outcomes, most
notably posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is the strongest predictor of poor quality of life following
trauma, even among those injured during the event. Given the potential harmful sequelae of trauma exposure,
it is crucial to identify acute post-victimization risk factors that predict chronic PTSD. At this juncture relatively
little data exists to aid in prediction of youth at risk for poor long-term adjustment following victimization or other
types of trauma, and there are no studies measuring relevant neural systems. Thus, our team aims to 1)
characterize acute post-victimization neurobehavioral predictors of risk for chronic PTSD with a focus on
prefrontal-subcortical function during processing of threat processing and frontoparietal networks for cognitive
control, and 2) use machine learning to identify the most robust set of predictors of chronic PTSD drawn from a
comprehensive assessment of youth neuroimaging, behavior and self-report, parent and family factors, and
neighborhood and community variables. Our team is well-prepared to successfully achieve these aims, as we
have relevant expertise in conducting prospective longitudinal assessment of acute neurobehavioral predictors
of risk for PTSD in adults (Larson), conducting longitudinal assessment of youth victims of violence (Levas),
and longitudinally characterizing neurobehavioral profiles of youth PTSD (Herringa). We will recruit youth
victims of violence aged 10-16 from the Emergency Department at Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin in
Milwaukee, and conduct comprehensive assessments at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months following
victimization. To achieve a final sample of 200 youth at 12 month follow-up, we will recruit 240 youth,
oversampled for risk for PTSD based on currently available brief self-report indicators. Each assessment will
include measures of neural systems instantiating threat processing, including both reactivity to threat and
anticipation of unpredictable and predictable threat, and cognitive control, along with measures of PTSD and
other symptoms, cognitive functioning, family environment, social and school functioning, and
socioenvironmental factors (e.g. neighborhood disadvantage, discrimination). We will examine how acute post-
victimization variables (2 week) and early change following victimization (from 2 weeks to 3 months) predict
PTSD and other outcomes twelve months later. We will use both hypothesis-driven analyses focusing on a
priori specified regions and predictors, as well as comprehensive data-driven machine learning analyses. The
comprehensive assessment will allow for determination of the additional utility of neural markers for predicting
risk beyond previously identified self-report indicators. We expect this project to lead to identification of
predictors of risk for PTSD following victimization that are linked to underlying processes (hyper-responsivity to
threat, aberrant cognitive control) that can directly inform preventive interventions, ultimately improving the
quality of life for youth victims of violence."
10850536,"Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), a type of cognitive disorder mainly induced by
cerebrovascular pathology and dysfunction, is widely recognized as the second most common cause of
dementia after Alzheimer’s disease, and results in tremendous economic and social burdens on our society.
Despite recent progress in VCID research, our understanding of cerebrovascular contributions to the
pathogenesis of VCID is still limited, and the effective therapeutic approaches for VCID are unavailable.
 Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) function as a novel class of noncoding RNAs that modulate gene or
protein expression. Cumulative studies have documented that lncRNAs are involved in many important
biological processes as well as implicated in regulating the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular diseases.
However, the functional significance and molecular mechanisms of lncRNA molecules in regulating
cerebrovascular pathogenesis and the progression of cognitive decline are totally unknown in VCID.
 In our recent preliminary studies, we have shown that the expression of a lncRNA, metastasis associated
lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1), is significantly increased in mouse cerebral vasculature after
chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-induced VCID. Of note, genetic deletion of Malat1 displayed increased
cognitive impairment, white matter injury, and neuronal loss in the experimental VCID mouse model, whereas
EC-selective Malat1 transgenic overexpression resulted in reduced cognitive impairment. Mechanistically, we
have documented that Malat1 genetic deficiency increased BBB permeability in mice after VCID. Moreover,
loss-of-Malat1 function by LNA-GapmeR significantly increased proinflammatory cytokines (MCP-1, E-selectin)
and reduced the expression of VE-cadherin and ZO-1 in primary brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs)
after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). These findings have provided the basis for our Central Hypothesis
that vascular Malat1 ameliorates white and grey matter injury and inhibits long-term cognitive decline
in CCH-induced VCID through maintaining BBB integrity and reducing endothelial inflammation to
improve the brain microenvironment. Three specific aims will be performed in this proposal. Aim 1: Define
the role of vascular Malat1 in long-term cognitive disorders, brain white matter injury, and neuronal loss in
experimental VCID; Aim 2: Elucidate the mechanisms of vascular Malat1-mediated brain protection in VCID;
Aim 3: Explore systematic delivery of the Malat1 activator polydatin as a potential therapy in VCID. Elucidating
Malat1 cerebrovascular protection will enable us to discover the vascular contribution to brain white and grey
matter injury and dementia, and lead us to develop novel and effective lncRNA-based treatment against VCID."
10852951,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neurodegenerative diseases lead to profound cognitive, emotional, and functional impairments that
leave individuals dependent upon close relational partners who provide care. Although caregiving is a positive
experience for many individuals, providing care for an individual who has socioemotional deficits due to
neurodegenerative disease can lead to adverse consequences for spousal caregivers, including poor mental
and physical health outcomes. However, little research examines the dyadic, interpersonal pathways through
which care recipients’ socioemotional deficits lead to health problems for their caregivers. The current research
focuses on interpersonal emotion regulation – the extent to which a caregiver’s negative emotion is
downregulated and a caregiver’s positive emotion is upregulated during conflict and an acute stressor with
their care recipient – as a potential pathway linking care recipients’ socioemotional deficits to their caregivers’
health problems. The research will compare neurotypicals with individuals who have Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)
and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) to understand how these different disease types
influence interpersonal emotion regulation (Aim 1). The research will delineate the neural, autonomic, and
behavioral correlates of interpersonal emotion regulation (Aim 2), with an emphasis on disease related atrophy,
autonomic, and behavioral factors theorized to subserve interpersonal emotion regulation, including vagal
flexibility, visual attention to other’s emotional expressions, and empathy. Finally, this research will examine
whether poor interpersonal emotion regulation impacts caregiver health longitudinally (Aim 3). To support the

11083220,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neurodegenerative diseases lead to profound cognitive, emotional, and functional impairments that
leave individuals dependent upon close relational partners who provide care. Although caregiving is a positive
experience for many individuals, providing care for an individual who has socioemotional deficits due to
neurodegenerative disease can lead to adverse consequences for spousal caregivers, including poor mental
and physical health outcomes. However, little research examines the dyadic, interpersonal pathways through
which care recipients’ socioemotional deficits lead to health problems for their caregivers. The current research
focuses on interpersonal emotion regulation – the extent to which a caregiver’s negative emotion is
downregulated and a caregiver’s positive emotion is upregulated during conflict and an acute stressor with
their care recipient – as a potential pathway linking care recipients’ socioemotional deficits to their caregivers’
health problems. The research will compare neurotypicals with individuals who have Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)
and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) to understand how these different disease types
influence interpersonal emotion regulation (Aim 1). The research will delineate the neural, autonomic, and
behavioral correlates of interpersonal emotion regulation (Aim 2), with an emphasis on disease related atrophy,
autonomic, and behavioral factors theorized to subserve interpersonal emotion regulation, including vagal
flexibility, visual attention to other’s emotional expressions, and empathy. Finally, this research will examine
whether poor interpersonal emotion regulation impacts caregiver health longitudinally (Aim 3). To support the

10849975,"Project Summary
Over 280,000 people die from advanced heart failure each year in the United States. This population
experiences burdensome symptoms, frequent hospitalizations, and delayed transitions to hospice care. Clinical
practice guidelines recommend the use of palliative care for people with advanced heart failure to address their
many palliative needs. However, fewer than 20% receive specialist palliative care, highlighting its markedly
limited reach among this population. Little is known about the palliative care and cardiology program
composition (i.e., structures) or operational characteristics (i.e., processes) that increase the reach of specialist
palliative care or improve care near the end of life. As a result, medical centers nationally struggle to implement
specialist palliative care for people with advanced heart failure and implementation varies widely. Our proposal
will address these critical knowledge gaps. Our long-term goal is to increase the reach of specialist palliative
care and improve the quality of end-of-life care among people with advanced heart failure. As a step towards
this goal, the objective of this proposal is to identify the key modifiable structures and processes of specialist
palliative care delivery that result in high-reach and three end-of-life care outcomes highly valued by people
with advanced heart failure: days at home in the last three months of life, hospice enrollment ≥ 7 days before
death and family-reported end-of-life care quality. To accomplish our objectives, we will conduct a rigorous
multisite, mixed methods study within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The VA is the largest
healthcare system in the United States comprised of 146 nationwide medical centers. Moreover, it is the only
healthcare system with an integrated electronic health record that includes detailed variables on structures and
processes of specialist palliative care, cardiology programs and practices, and surveys of bereaved family
members. We will combine VA data with data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid to comprehensively
examine care near the end of life within and outside of the VA. We will evaluate associations between
specialist palliative care and cardiology program structures and processes and the reach of specialist palliative
care (Aim 1), and the three outcomes of end-of-life care quality (Aim 2). Next, we will conduct interviews with
specialist palliative care and cardiology clinicians and analyze policy documents and consultation templates to
identify strategies employed by medical centers that have successfully implemented specialist palliative care
for people with advanced heart failure and compare them to those medical centers that have not (Aim 3).
Finally, we will integrate quantitative and qualitative data to identify comprehensive strategies that facilitate the
implementation of specialist palliative care for this population. This proposal directly aligns with NOT-HL-20-
737, by identifying practical strategies that can effectively overcome barriers and support sustained delivery of
specialist palliative care. Findings from our project will provide valuable insights that can be utilized by
palliative care and cardiology programs across the country, ultimately improving patient care."
10853084,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Despite having limited sets of signaling components and number of genes, cells must be able to distinctly
respond to a large number of input signals, such as environmental stresses, as well as execute diverse gene
expression programs. It is vital that cells receive, transmit, filter, and act upon these signals accurately to trigger
the appropriate downstream gene response program, as dysregulation and aberrant signaling have important
implications in the initiation or progression of diseases such as immune disorders and cancer.
Specifically, a single transcription factor (TF) can respond to a wide variety of input signals by changing its
nuclear localization dynamics to activate specific promoters. However, the study of transcriptional dynamics is
limited to largely correlational relationships due to technical barriers such as cell-to-cell variability, pleotropic
effects of experimental perturbations, expression averages that mask heterogeneity, and fluorescence based
techniques that limit the number of measurable target genes. The central hypothesis of this work is that the
functional connections between TF dynamics and their downstream regulation of gene expression
programs can be identified and tuned by the integrated use of carefully characterized and controlled
optogenetic systems with single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), increasing our understanding of
gene regulation in human cells for engineering and biomedical applications. NF-κB (p65/RELA), which
regulates hundreds of genes and is heavily implicated in immunological responses and cancer, will serve as the
model TF for our system.
 To address this challenge and information gap, the proposed work will build upon a suite of sophisticated
tools developed in our lab to combine optogenetic based TF translocation with scRNAseq. We will establish a
robust, tightly controlled system and examine the genome wide effect of direct perturbations of NF-κB across
thousands of cells. Three main objectives will be targeted: Aim 1 will result in the development of a fully
controllable, optogenetic system to precisely regulate p65 translocation in HeLa cells by landing pad integration,
optimization of localization dynamics, and validation by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain
reaction of known target genes. Aim 2 will focus on determination of whole-genome gene transcriptomic profiles
and cell-to-cell heterogeneity in response to traditionally used, chemically stimulated p65 dynamics using
scRNAseq. By combining these two components, Aim 3 will directly control p65 dynamics with 15 distinct
optogenetic inputs and assess resultant single cell transcriptomic changes using scRNAseq. In sum, we aim to
provide an efficient, functional system to provide direct, causal relationships between TF dynamics and
gene expression in human cells and exact control in cellular engineering by leveraging complete control
of TF translocation through optogenetics, precise tools in mammalian synthetic biology, and transcriptome wide,
single cell gene expression profiles provided by scRNAseq."
10853971,"Viral infectious diseases remain a significant threat and, as demonstrated in recent years, can be particularly
disruptive and unpredictable in their impact on human lives, economies, and public health. Advances in
genomic science have enabled leaps in how to manage, respond to, and mitigate viral disease, but significant
gaps remain in what we know: we have a limited understanding of the pathogens that exist in our environment,
how they spread, and which of them have epidemic potential, leaving us vulnerable to the emergence of future
threats. Without more complete knowledge of the pathogens around us, it will be difficult or impossible to
develop countermeasures with sufficient speed to stop major outbreaks in the future.
Our long-term goal is to advance understanding and utility of viral genomics so that we are better able to
prepare for and respond to future outbreaks: we aim to comprehensively identify circulating viruses, infer viral
evolutionary signals and human transmission chains, and characterize the effect of consequential mutations on
the virus, its immunogenicity, and impact on humans. The Broad Institute’s GCID has led many technical,
analytical, and translational advances that have revolutionized the application of genomics to viral disease. The
experience, resources, and innovative capacity of this group will all be necessary to address the gaps that
remain, and new challenges that emerge, in our understanding of and our ability to respond to ongoing threats
posed by viral diseases. The premise of this proposal is improved insights from viral genomic data will
accelerate the design of viral diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines, and will inform public health strategies
and policy. We plan to do this by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1) Detect emerging viral threats
with robust metagenomics and diagnostic designs (this includes improving methods for metagenomic
surveillance and PCR diagnostic designs). 2) Genomic epidemiology and population genetics of viral outbreaks
and epidemics (this includes analytic methods for Bayesian phylogenetic inference of evolutionary signals and
of human transmission chains and clusters. 3) Identify and characterize viral genetic variation with phenotypic
impact (this includes identification and in vitro characterization of viral mutations). The expected outcomes of
this work are a systematic understanding of circulating viral threats with epidemic potential,
genomics-informed view of viral transmission during outbreaks, and a characterization of the viral genetic
adaptations that affect their spread and impact on society. This proposal will have a positive impact by
providing genomic data resources, insights into viral circulation, developing new analytic and interpretive
frameworks for epidemiological insights to influence public health practice, and creating public data sets to
enable the design of new interventions for viral disease. Our work will advance viral genomics by creating new
data, tools, and resources across multiple pathogens and settings."
10853974,"Genomic approaches have demonstrated significant capacity to inform the diagnosis, control, and basic
biological understanding of long-established vector-borne diseases such as malaria, and newer diseases that
have graduated from regionally to global concerns such as Zika. This Project will use genomic data to inform
intervention strategies for vector-borne diseases at all stages of development, from the level of basic biology and
therapeutic target ID (Aim 1), to data collection for disease elimination strategy development (Aim 2), to providing
real-time situational awareness of an active disease elimination campaign and novel circulating viruses (Aim 3).
Specific Aim 1: Identify host determinants of malaria infection through base-editing screens.
We will functionally explore human red blood cell polymorphisms using state-of-the-art CRISPR base-editing
tools to produce a library of red blood cells expressing known and candidate malaria-protective polymorphisms.
We will further use precision base-editing to functionally evaluate each codon of the basigin invasion receptor
using existing and engineered polymorphisms, given that the parasite ligand to this receptor (PfRH5) is an
important vaccine target. We will measure the efficiency with which parasites invade edited red blood cells in
pooled assays.
Specific Aim 2: Define the pre-elimination genomic epidemiology of malaria in Mesoamerica
We will sequence several hundred P. falciparum and P. vivax clinical specimens from Guatemala, Honduras,
and Panamá. Integration of these data with the thousands of South American parasite genomes we have
produced under the current GCID award will identify the impact of regional human migration on MesoAmerican
malaria transmission, highlight potential shifts in drug sensitivity, and inform regional elimination plans.
Specific Aim 3: Deploy molecular xenomonitoring of filaria and arboviruses in Guyana
We will survey Aedes and Culex mosquitoes collected in Guyana for filarial worms using targeted genomic
assays to test the hypothesis that mosquito xenomonitoring is more sensitive to residual transmission than
human serological surveys. We will additionally perform viral metagenomic sequencing of mosquito salivary
glands to characterize the abundance of known and novel vertebrate viruses.
Impact: This work will employ innovative genomic approaches to inform short term and long term control
strategies for malaria, the most significant vector-borne disease, and will further develop new methodologies for
supporting filarial worm eradication and detection of novel vector-borne diseases that warrant future surveillance
to prevent wider spillover."
10849982,"Summary Abstract
 Heroin use disorder continues to be a serious and growing national health problem that requires an effective
solution that produces long-term abstinence and prevents relapse. A major problem in the treatment of
substance use disorder is the prevention of relapse, itself triggered by stress, drug cues and drug itself.
Addiction treatments are only modestly successful in maintaining long-term abstinence and preventing relapse.
However, an emerging effective behavioral treatment is environmental enrichment (EE). We have demonstrated
in rat models of relapse that EE administered as a treatment after heroin self-administration training significantly
facilitates abstinence and reduces heroin cue-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. In recent years, there has
been an increase in the clinical use of EE as treatment for substance use disorder. However, almost nothing is
known about the behavioral and neural mechanisms by which EE confers its beneficial effects on abstinence
and relapse. A better understanding of these mechanisms not only is valuable in its own right but also would aid
in the development of improved neurobiological and behavioral treatments.
 It is well-established that the relapse trigger—drug cues—activates dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral
tegmental area (VTA) causing DA release in terminal regions of this DA system and that DA release in those
regions causes “drug craving” and relapse in humans and animals. EE causes profound changes in behavior,
cognition and brain, including in the terminal regions of the VTA DA system. We hypothesize that EE may reduce
drug seeking by reversing some of the behavioral and neural adaptations brought about by chronic heroin intake.
The proposed studies will investigate this.
 In Specific Aim 1 we will characterize adaptations in DA release in the terminal regions of the DA system
as a result of heroin self-administration and determine if those adaptations are reversed by EE.
 In Specific Aim 2 we will characterize how heroin self-administration dysregulates addiction-associated
receptors in the terminal regions of the DA system and determine if those adaptations are reversed by EE.
 Drug addiction also is associated with negative affect and anhedonia (diminished capacity for non-drug
reward). We propose that those negative states contribute to continued drug seeking and use and, therefore,
understanding how to reverse them would aid in the development of improved treatments. We hypothesize that
EE confers its beneficial effects on drug seeking by reversing the negative affect and anhedonia associated with
chronic drug use. In Specific Aim 3 we will characterize the behavioral adaptations occurring as a result of
chronic opioid intake and determine if EE reverses those adaptations.
 The proposed studies will (1) reveal neural and behavioral adaptations that underlie drug addiction and
(2) reveal those adaptions that can be targeted for reversal in order to neurobiologically and behaviorally
reduce drug seeking (i.e., relapse), leading to the development of more effective treatments for substance use
disorder."
10850296,"Project Summary
 Blood contacting medical devices, including rotary blood pumps, cause shear-induced blood damage that
may lead to adverse effects in patients. However, there is currently not a uniformly accepted engineering model
for predicting the blood damage caused by complex flow fields within ventricular assist devices (VADs) and other
blood contacting medical devices.
 Our research group has designed and fabricated a novel device that can expose whole blood to controlled
fluid shear flows that are representative of those experienced in these pumps. The device is able to accurately
control the shear rate and exposure time experienced by blood and minimize the effects of other uncharacterized
stresses, such as mechanical or fluid lubricated bearings. We plan to use this novel device to study red cell
damage (hemolysis) and platelet activation in this shear flow. Although the effects of shear flow have been
studied, we believe that our novel device will generate data that is a quantum step forward. Our one-of-a-kind
device creates a shear relevant to those experienced in modern VADs without including incidental exposure to
heat and shear in the mechanical bearings of other shearing devices. Our recent publication suggests that a
paradigm shift (shear rate vs. shear stress) may be necessary to generate a truly predictive model of shear
damage that would be useful in designing future devices. If funded, we will complete the study of shear rate
instead of shear stress as a predictor for hemolysis (Aim 1), expand measurements to shear activation of
platelets (Aim 2), and explore the variation in damage between species (Aim 3), which is critical because pre-
clinical in vitro testing of medical devices typically uses non-human blood.
 Although there have been significant advances in the ability of computer programs to predict the velocity and
shear flows through medical devices, the ability to then subsequently predict the damage resulting from this flow
is, frankly, poor. The results of this project will be a significant step towards a quantitative predictive model that
relates properties of the fluid flow field to damage. Additionally, we will share the results in the form of easy to
access quantitative models that relate hemolysis and platelet activation to shear stress and shear strain. We will
also create and share a tool to relate damage observed in non-human species to human blood.
 Although our focus is on supraphysiologic flows caused by ventricular assist devices, the findings are relevant
to other blood contacting medical devices as well, such as prosthetic valves, dialysis, oxygenators, and cannulae."

This application seeks support for Ms. Eskira Kahsay, a doctoral candidate in the Department of Epidemiology,
through a Research Supplement to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research. This supplement builds on
the activities of the parent grant (R01-MH128198; PI: Mezuk) which supports the Aging, Transitions over the
Life course, and Suicide (ATLAS) Project. The overarching goal of the parent project is to examine the ways
major transitions in domains of work, housing, health, and relationships shape suicide risk over the lifespan
using multiple large existing datasets. We seek to understand how contextual factors such as gender, race,
ethnicity, poverty, urbanicity, social capital, etc. shape suicide risk during these transitions. Through this
supplement, Ms. Kahsay will build on the parent ATLAS Project, and her own prior work, to test hypotheses
about how contextual factors shape suicide risk for Black adolescents and adults. This supplement will
incorporate an additional, unique dataset into the ATLAS Project: the National Survey of American Life (NSAL),
a nationally-representative sample of over 5,000 Black Americans aged 13+ originally interviewed in 2001,
which has since been geocoded and linked to the National Death Index. This proposed research will use the
NSAL and other ATLAS datasets to address the following aims: (1) Investigate the relationship between
residential segregation and suicide morality among Black Americans; (2) Examine the relationship between
residential segregation and suicidal behavior (i.e., ideation, attempts and death) among Black adolescents and
adults; and (3) Explore salient psychosocial and contextual risk and protective factors associated with suicide
and suicidal behavior among Black Americans using machine learning approaches. This supplement supports
a comprehensive mentoring and career development plan for the candidate, Ms. Kahsay, to guide her through
the completion of her doctoral training and successful launch of her academic research career. This mentoring
plan leverages long-standing partnerships with the Institute for Social Research Program for Research on
Black Americans (PRBA) and the Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research (MCUAAAR:
P30-AG059300; Mezuk is the co-Director of the Analysis Core). Both PRBA and MCUAAAR have a variety of
structures for supporting professional development, team mentorship, and research activities for early-career
investigators working in minority health. This supplement will provide dedicated time for the candidate to
engage in focused research activities, to build her professional network, to engage in additional trainings and
workshops that will strengthen her methodological skills in data science and spatial modeling, and to receive
expert team mentorship from leaders in the fields of epidemiology, sociology, biostatistics, and minority health.
She will emerge from this period of training well-prepared to compete as PI for her own F- and K-level NIH
grants to support the next stage of her research career focused on minority mental health."
10853104,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Fetal growth restriction is associated with a profound increase in perinatal and even long-term health risk.
Antenatal care is key to optimizing outcomes and preventing stillbirth, yet up to half of growth-restricted infants
are not identified during pregnancy. The placenta serves a central in maintaining a healthy pregnancy and
supporting fetal growth; yet, direct assessment of placental development is glaringly absent from clinical care as
there are no practical tools that enable providers to monitor placental development. In recent years, 3D
ultrasound (3DUS) has allowed investigators to identify important associations between placental morphology
and clinical outcomes using a variety of offline medical image analysis techniques. However, these techniques
typically require extensive manual input. Moreover, we have recently developed an innovative tool based on a
dynamic model of fetal-placental growth that considers placental growth in the evaluation of fetal growth and can
help identify pregnancies at increased risk of growth restriction. However, this tool requires placental volume
assessment, which, as mentioned above, remains impractical for clinical use.
In this proposal, we will expand and enhance our automated segmentation tools to enable bedside volumetric
assessment of the placenta throughout pregnancy. In addition, we will develop novel tools and parameters for
assessing placental shape, gross morphology, and vascularity in an effort to identify additional features of
placental development that can augment our understanding of placental development and create additional
markers of placental health.
Taken together, the current proposal leverages an ongoing collaboration between computer scientists and
physician-scientists to utilize modern fully automated image analysis methodology to create clinically impactful
placental assessment tools that can be integrated into the clinical workflow. The proposed research will allow
bedside assessment of placental morphology and vascularity, which can be leveraged into precision medicine
approaches and allow for more accurate and reliable surveillance of fetal growth and well-being. Specifically, we
will build: 1) Refine and validate a fetal-placental growth model using automated early placental volume and
placental histopathology, 2) Extend to include later gestational ages and expand the toolkit to include novel
measures of placental shape and vascularity, and 3) create an augmented version of the dynamic model that
incorporates the added functionality of our segmentation pipeline, as well as serum biomarkers, to result in a
clinically useful tool for monitoring fetal growth.
We anticipate that this proposal will significantly change clinical care and create a new, placenta-based paradigm
for understanding and managing fetal growth disorders."

The purpose of this project is to develop a novel image-guided approach for modulating the tumor
microenvironment (TME) of HCC with combined mechanotherapeutic drugs (MechTx) and ultrasound cavitation
treatment (USCTx), and evaluate its therapeutic efficacy. We plan to implement USCTx and the targeting and
monitoring of the combined (with MechTx) treatment on a clinical scanner in order to make it widely available for
future preclinical and clinical studies. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related
deaths worldwide with an estimated 750,000 new cases per year. Most patients with HCC who are not candidates
for surgical removal or ablation are treated with either transarterial chemoembolization or systemic
chemotherapy. Yet these treatments result in only limited improvements in patient survival at the expense of
considerable toxicities. Our main hypothesis is that the combined USCTx and MechTx will lead to tumor
pressure, stiffness and vascular changes that promote increased local tumor uptake of systemic or transarterial
chemotherapeutics, and will result in better therapy outcomes. While the discovery of new chemotherapeutic
agents and interventional procedures will continue to evolve, our approach to modulate the TME with combined
MechTx and USCTx aims to dramatically improve chemotherapy outcomes with both the existing and future
chemotherapy agents. A strong interdisciplinary team (bioengineers, scientists, clinicians) from academia and
industry will collaborate in the following aims: (Aim 1) Evaluate the ability of MechTx to modulate the tumor
microenvironment and enhance drug delivery; (Aim 2) Evaluate the ability of USCTx to modulate the tumor
microenvironment and enhance drug delivery; (Aim 3) Evaluate the ability of combined MechTx and USCTx to
modulate the tumor microenvironment and enhance drug delivery; and (Aim 4) Demonstrate the preclinical
efficacy of chemotherapeutics when combined with MechTx and USCTx in survival studies using two in vivo
models of HCC. The innovation of the project is in: (a) the use of MechTx as a novel therapeutic strategy to
modulate tumor pressure, microvascular flow, and stiffness of the TME; (b) implementing image-guided USCTx
on a clinical ultrasound scanner leading to translatable precision medicine for HCC; (c) utilizing the synergy of
MechTx and USCTx as a novel and innovative approach for modulating the TME to maximize chemotherapy
outcomes; and (d) combining super resolution and nonlinear Doppler processing to spatially and temporarily
super-resolve the vasculature of tumors undergoing treatments that target the TME. The proposed project will
take advantage of the distinct, yet synergistic mechanisms of MechTx and USCTx as a novel paradigm of
sensitization of the TME to chemotherapeutics, leading to better treatment outcomes and overall survival for
HCC patients initially and patients of other malignancies and diseases in the future."
10853120,"Lineage plasticity in prostate cancer cells—defined as loss of androgen receptor (AR) signaling and switch
from a luminal to an alternate differentiation program—is now recognized as a critical determinant of lethality in
prostate cancer. The most virulent form is neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). De novo NEPC is rare
(<1% of patients). However, we recently found that castration-induced, treatment-emergent (t-NEPC) is much
more frequently found in tumors from men resistant to drugs such as abiraterone or enzalutamide. This
strongly suggests AR interference promotes the emergence of this phenotype. There are no effective therapies
for t-NEPC, and t-NEPC patients are often excluded from clinical trials due to t-NEPC’s aggressiveness. Thus,
there is a clear need to develop new treatments.
 Recently, we discovered that specific transcription factors (TFs) and the BET bromodomain protein BRD4
cooperate to promote t-NEPC differentiation and cell survival. This application is designed to clarify
mechanisms by which these TF and BRD4 function and to block those mechanisms. Our long term goal is to
develop pharmacological strategies that prevent the emergence of lethal t-NEPC. Towards that goal, we
determined that targeting BET bromodomain proteins with BET inhibitors (BETi) or BET PROTAC degraders
(BETd) is a promising approach to block the lineage switch to t-NEPC and to block t-NEPC cell survival in vitro.
The studies we describe herein are designed to test the hypotheses that BRD4 and cooperating TFs activate
a lineage plasticity program that sustains survival of t-NEPC cells; targeting this BRD4/TF axis is a rational
approach to prevent or delay t-NEPC disease progression.
Aim 1: Determine mechanisms by which BRD4 cooperates with specific TFs to promote expression of
a t-NEPC lineage plasticity survival program. Completion of this aim will provide a detailed understanding of
how BRD4 and cooperating factors promote lineage plasticity and will determine whether activation of these
TFs is reliable predictive marker of favorable BET inhibitor response.
Aim 2: Treat t-NEPC patient tumors implanted in mice with BETi or BETd and measure anti-tumor
activity and NEPC differentiation. Completion of this aim will provide the rationale for BETi or BETd clinical
trials in t-NEPC patients and identify adaptive resistance mechanisms.
Aim 3: Prevent castration-induced t-NEPC lineage switch with BETi or BETd using a patient tumor
model of t-NEPC lineage switch implanted in mice. Completion of this aim will provide the rationale to test
BETi or BETd in patients at high-risk for t-NEPC conversion and identify biomarkers of response.
 We expect that the studies proposed will clarify mechanistically the function of transcriptional network that
is critical for the emergence and survival of t-NEPC. These results will help identify new approches to block this
network in men with t-NEPC in the near-term."

In the long-term we aim to understand the genetic, biochemical and structural basis for extreme virus function
and stability. Sulfolobus Spindle-shaped Virus 1 (SSV1) is astonishingly stable to both high temperatures
(>80°C) and low pH (3 and below). This stability is despite being composed of proteins and nucleic acids with
similar compositions to viruses and other macromolecular complexes found in less extreme conditions.
However, it is not clear how SSV1’s extreme capsid stability is determined. We have developed robust genetic
tools for SSV1 and standardized techniques for working with these extreme viruses, and demonstrated their
use in undergraduate research. Together, these tools and the recently-determined structure allow probing of
the determinants of stability as follows.
Determine the amino acids in the SSV1 major capsid protein VP1 that are important for thermal
stability using site directed mutagenesis (Aim 1). We have determined that the spindle-shaped SSV1 virion
is composed of seven intertwined helical strands of the major capsid protein, VP1. Using the predicted
structure of VP1 and the virion structure, we will make site-directed mutations in 3 sets of amino acid side
chains: those predicted to be in loops and glycosylated, those predicted to make interactions between strands
and those predicted to form intramolecular interactions in VP1. These mutant viruses will be screened for
activity at multiple temperatures.
Use in vitro evolution to select SSV1 VP1 and VP3 mutants for increased thermal stability (Aim 2). In
order to perform an unbiased screen of amino acid substitutions that could confer stability to SSV1 we will
make a library of mutants that contain random substitutions in the major and minor capsid proteins VP1 and
VP3. These mutants will be selected in vitro for their ability to maintain infectivity at 80°C and 90°C.
Comparison of mutant libraries before and after selection with high throughput sequencing will be used to
determine which substitutions are permitted and which, if any, stabilize the virus.
Impact: Characterizing SSV1 mutants in vitro (Aim 1) and in vivo (Aim 2) will provide insight into fundamental
aspects of protein and virus stability including glycosylation. The identification of amino acid substitutions that
stabilize or destabilize SSV will help refine the SSV1 structural model. The results obtained in this project could
facilitate the creation of highly stable SSV-based nanoparticles, methods to destabilize pathogenic viruses and
produce stabilized vaccines. Finally, this project will allow Portland State University (PSU) students to engage
in cutting edge biomedical research and strengthen the PSU research environment."

A major goal of this laboratory is to understand the molecular mechanisms by which nuclear receptors (NRs)
regulate metabolism. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is the master regulator of adipocyte
biology and the target of thiazolidinedione (TZD) drugs that uniquely reverse insulin resistance. Clinical use of
TZDs has been hindered by side effects, making it critical to better understand the functions of PPARγ. There
are two PPARγ isoforms, and a glaring unanswered question is whether they subserve different functions which
could be harnessed to more specifically target insulin resistance. Specific Aim 1 is to elucidate the unique
cistromes, interactomes, and physiological functions of PPARγ isoforms γ1 and γ2. Little is known about
the two major isoforms of PPARγ. We hypothesize that PPARγ1 and γ2 have isoform-specific functions that
differentially contribute to both therapeutic and adverse effects of PPARγ ligands. To test this, we generated
novel mouse models of isoform-specific deletion, as well as mice with epitope tags knocked into the endogenous
isoforms. Preliminary data reveal isoform-specific metabolic phenotypes, as well as differential genomic binding
and transcriptomic regulation. The underlying mechanisms will be evaluated by determining isoform-specific
interactomes in the basal state and upon TZD treatment. Molecular factors that mediate isoform-specific effects
will be manipulated to specifically target the metabolic functions of PPARγ1 or γ2. Specific Aim 2 is to
determine individual-specific functions of glucocorticoids in humans. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is
another NR that is a major drug target with untoward side effects; glucocorticoids (GC) are widely prescribed for
inflammatory conditions, but cause obesity, diabetes, and lipid disorders. There is presently no way to predict
which patients will suffer from adverse effects of GCs, nor which will most benefit from therapy. We hypothesize
that SNPs function in adipocytes to control GR binding and GC effects on metabolism and inflammation in a
predictable, patient-specific manner. Preliminary data demonstrate individual-specific GR binding and GC effects
on gene expression and metabolism in multiple patient stem cell-derived adipocytes and hepatocytes, which will
be related to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) controlling the binding of GR. The mechanisms underlying
the function of these SNPs will be determined, as will their effects on metabolic functions of the cells as well as
predicting adverse metabolic effects of GC in patient populations. We also hypothesize that SNPs will control
individual differences in anti-inflammatory potency due to individual differences in GR binding and function that
will be tested in stem cell-derived macrophages from multiple patients. Together, our innovative genome-wide
and systems approaches will provide fundamental insights into molecular mechanisms underlying tissue- and
individual-specific effects of PPARγ and GR, guiding new therapies and predictions of patient-specific therapeutic
and adverse responses to drugs."
10854775,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a major public health concern with a high prevalence in the US
population. Functional, molecular, and structural imaging offer a unique opportunity to understand the
pathophysiology of CAD, especially in high-risk groups such as patients with obesity, diabetes, and chronic
kidney disease (cardiometabolic disease). CAD evaluation by imaging is based on modalities that assess (1)
myocardial ischemia and myocardial blood flow (2) anatomic burden of atherosclerosis, and (3) disease activity
using novel techniques.
However, physicians are not yet able to use these data optimally to identify patients at highest risk of adverse
events—due to technical complexity of advanced multivariable data, and lack of automation and integrative tools.
While positron emission tomography (PET) can measure myocardial blood flow, and depict high-risk plaque in
the arteries and CT can reliably detect coronary artery calcium —an unequivocal marker for atherosclerotic
disease– physicians are not able to combine these data effectively to identify patients at highest risk of adverse
events, due to complexity and lack of automation.
Critically, there is an unmet need for efficient integration of diverse imaging and clinical data by a robust,
automated clinical tool after non-invasive imaging. Highly efficient artificial intelligence (AI) methods are
revolutionizing image analysis and could improve CAD detection and management. The overall vision for the
research program is to further the clinical utility of PET/CT in detecting high-risk CAD and guiding subsequent
management by automation and integrating all image and clinical data with state-of-the-art AI. We will establish
a large multicenter PET and CT imaging registry and with image-based AI, automate analysis and quality control
for robust analysis even at less experienced centers, and develop decision support tools utilizing collectively all
available PET/CT images and clinical information (beyond what is possible by subjective visual analysis and
mental integration). We will develop direct interpretation of images by AI, and patient-specific explanation of the
AI findings to the physician. Precise quantitative results will be presented to clinicians (and patients) in easy to
understand terms (e.g., % risk per year or as the relative risk of one therapy compared to the alternative) for a
specific patient. This work will allow accurate identification of patients with high-risk disease who can benefit
treatment from advanced therapies and enable precise patient-specific risk estimates and treatment
recommendations in challenging clinical scenarios—in CAD with cardiometabolic disease and advanced high-
risk disease."
10854883,"DESCRIPTION
Glaucoma is a group of diseases that results in a pathological loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and irreversible
vision loss. Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor for glaucoma, but some individuals with
elevated pressures never develop disease, and others with low pressures progress to blindness. Similarly, in the
non-human primate experimental glaucoma model, animals with similar IOP profiles are shown to have
significant differences in the extent and rate of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness loss. Both clinical and
experimental models suggest that in addition to IOP, other factors need to be considered for glaucoma
progression. We hypothesize the variability in disease progression can be explained by vascular factors. The
retina is one of the most metabolic tissues in the body, and it is unknown if eyes with relatively lower vascular
volume, or eyes that show greater change in perfusion with changes in IOP are at greater risk of pathology.
Furthermore, although eyes with optic neuropathy have reduced vascular density, it remains unknown if there
are changes in retinal vasculature that precede RGC loss. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA)
is a non-invasive method for three-dimensional vascular perfusion imaging. However, analysis of OCTA imaged
vasculature is based on slab projections, where the three-dimensional nature of tissue is lost. In addition, OCTA
vascular perfusion is often considered a static measure, but vascular flow velocity has temporal properties. For
this project, we have optimized OCTA scans to quantify vascular volume and vascular volume density, and using
sequential and registered scans, OCTA temporal variability. In the non-human primate experimental glaucoma
model, we will determine; 1. if the rate of disease progression is related to baseline global and regional measures
of vascular volume / volume density and regional OCTA temporal variability, 2. if there is loss of vascular volume
prior to inner retinal thickness, 3. if the rate of structural and functional changes are is related to the extent to
which vascular perfusion changes with IOP challenge, and 4. using post-mortem tissue, define vascular anatomy
(pericyte coverage, endothelial cell density, capillary basement membrane thickness/integrity) in healthy and
disease eyes and association with in vivo OCTA measures. Successful completion of these aims will establish if
vascular measures as quantified using OCTA can be used to determine risk of pathology, and rate of glaucoma
progression."

The United States (U.S.) Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) plan’s primary goal is to reduce the number of new
HIV infections by 90% by 2030, but this will not happen unless we develop ways to BRING the evidenced-
based services to persons who use drugs (PWUD). Overdose deaths are dramatically increasing in the US,
and fentanyl and stimulants are fueling new HIV epidemics. My career and my passion revolve around
integration of treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) and other substance use disorders with HIV treatment
and prevention. Through over 20 years of direct clinical care as an infectious disease and addiction medicine
physician combined with substantial clinical research expertise involving PWUD living with and at risk of HIV, I
know the blind spots in the EHE plan and I can fill them in with this pioneer award. My pioneering award
vision is to: 1) train persons who live in the communities affected by high levels of overdose to be community
health workers (CHWs) to provide the HIV testing and rapid diagnosis of OUD; 2) create mobile hubs that are
pharmacies and clinics on wheels that can be deployed to immediately dispense pre-exposure prophylaxis
(PrEP), antiretroviral therapy (ART), and medication treatment for OUD (MOUD) anywhere; 3) develop rapidly
deployable mobile rapid response teams (the mobile spokes) comprised of the CHWs and pharmacists with 24
hour access to online clinicians that deploy out from the mobile hubs to where the CHWs identify to bring the
medications (PrEP/ART based on the rapid HIV testing results, and MOUD to people who have a diagnosis of
OUD) to where people ‘live’; and 4) collaborate with researchers, including modelers, to prioritize where
outbreaks of HIV are most likely to occur and provide a collaboration hub for others working in the fields of HIV
and substance use disorders to help inform this proposed care model. Through this award, I will also ensure
that the mobile rapid response teams continue to follow people and help them retain on the medications and
address competing needs to eliminate barriers to accessing services. Thus, the overall idea in this pioneer
award is providing low barrier services at multiple access points in line with the EHE plans where we would be
BRINGING the testing and treatment plans (MOUD, PrEP/ART) to PWUD and RETAINING them via non-
traditional methods where THEY LIVE. Through using trained persons who LIVE in the communities (CHWs)
with shared living experiences of their community members who use drugs and are at risk or living with HIV,
we can provide the testing and diagnosis services combined with pharmacists to dispense the medications in
real-time to people who typically do not have access to our normal clinical or research venues including
women, justice-involved persons, immigrants, the uninsured, and underrepresented minorities. I have the
experience, the passion, the work ethic and the collaborative team to help end HIV in PWUD through this
pioneer award."
10854885,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders among the aged population. Studies
showed the critical impacts of apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 isoform on susceptibility and pathogenesis of late-onset AD
(LOAD). APOE proteins modulate amyloid beta (Aβ) in extracellular plaque formation in an isoform dependent manner.
Mitochondrial deficits were also shown associated with risk APOE ε4 and Aβ in AD. The interplay of APOE ε4 and Aβ likely
modulates the inter-organelle crosstalk, which justifies the investigation into such crosstalk in AD pathogenesis. The pilot
study found increased contacts formed between mitochondria and endolysosomal system in AD neurons compared to
non-AD controls, both in human brain and the mouse model. Furthermore, many more contacts were observed among
human AD APOE ε4 carriers than in AD APOE ε3 carriers. In vitro studies showed APOE AD risk isoform affected the mito-
endolysosomal contacts and mitochondrial Aβ levels and identified STARD3 as an important mediator. These exciting data
unveiled a novel abnormality in mito-endolysosomal contacts, which was associated with APOE ε4 regulated Aβ toxicity
in AD. Therefore, we hypothesized that APOE ε4 caused abnormally increased mito-endolysosome interaction and mi-
tochondrial translocation/accumulation of Aβ through enhanced interaction with STARD3 which led to mitochondrial
dysfunction and neurodegeneration in sporadic LOAD. To test this hypothesis, the detailed examination of the mito-
endolysosomal contact by in vivo and in vitro AD models is required. The long-term goal of this study is the pursuit of
abnormal inter-organelle crosstalk that likely underlies mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal degeneration in LOAD. In
this regard, the efforts will strive to decipher these three specific aims: 1) whether and how the abnormal crosstalk be-
tween mitochondria and endolysosomal system causes mitochondrial deficits, 2) what is the role of the interplay of APOE
ε4 and its endosomal cargo Aβ in such inter-organelle crosstalk, 3) whether the underlying mechanism supports a thera-
peutic potential for AD. The proposal will focus on the pathogenesis in general sporadic AD population associated with
common AD risk APOE isoform. Importantly, the proposed novel mechanism will also pave the road for discovery of a yet
uncharacterized therapeutic target for common AD population."

Infections are frequent complications in sickle cell disease (SCD), occurring in up to 45% of patients. In Africa,
where up to 90% of children with SCD die by age 5 years, many of these deaths are attributed to infection. In
SCD, the spleen is damaged in infancy and results in marginal zone B cell deficiency. The clinical implications
of B cell deficiency in SCD are not fully understood and requires investigating both disease-intrinsic and -
extrinsic modifiers of B cell subsets. In this investigation, I will quantify B cell subsets in children with and
without SCD in Texas and in Tanzania, investigate mechanisms of B cell deficiency, and compare them to
important clinical endpoints.
Aim 1: Characterize mechanisms of MZB deficiency in SCD. Hypotheses: There is a difference in the
development, survival, and function of B cells from SCD and non-SCD subjects due to B-cell intrinsic factors.
Differences in B cell populations may be due to differences in kinetics of differentiation and proliferation and/or
survival. To examine differentiation and proliferation, I will measure the efficiency of differentiation of
transitional B cells from SCD and non-SCD donors into MZBs, and MZBs into plasma cells using an in vitro B
cell co-culture system. To examine survival, I will measure the rate of apoptosis and expression of markers of
apoptosis (e.g. annexin V, caspase 3/9, BCL2) in native and culture-derived MZBs in culture.
Aim 2: Determine the effect of the microenvironment of the spleen in SCD on B cells. Hypothesis:
Extrinsic factors such as the inflammatory environment in SCD impair B cell development, survival, and
function. To examine the effect of the microenvironment on B cells in culture, I will culture non-SCD B cells in
media supplemented with SCD serum or spleen extract. To investigate which components of the extract impact
B cells, I will develop a cytokine profile for the extract and serum using multiplex ELISA.
Aim 3: Determine whether low MZB is associated with infectious and inflammatory complications of
SCD. Hypothesis: Life-threatening infections in SCD are more common among children with severe MZB
deficiency. To determine whether B-cell tropic viruses have a confounding effect on MZB number, I will
measure immune response to EBV and malaria using a custom multiplex ELISA panel. To determine whether
infectious complications are associated with more severe MZB deficiency in SCD, I will compare MZB among
children with and without complications such as acute chest, osteomyelitis, or bacteremia.
Despite a shared driver mutation, the clinical phenotype in SCD is highly variable. Together, the studies in this
proposal will overcome critical barriers to risk-stratifying patients for infectious and inflammatory complications
of SCD. Increased insights into how SCD catalyzes B cell deficiency may help identify novel therapeutic
targets or biomarkers to mitigate the impact of infections on SCD. My central hypothesis is that B cell
abnormalities contribute to morbidity and mortality in children with SCD."

The heart is a metabolically demanding organ, and derangements in metabolic processes lead to energetic
deficits, generation of toxic metabolites, and redox imbalance, which drive pathogenesis to heart failure.
However, current therapies for heart failure do not address this fundamental issue, and there remains an unmet
clinical need for effective mechanism-based treatments. Altered transcriptional programs are thought to
contribute significantly to impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and insufficient energy production in
heart failure. The estrogen-related receptors (ERRa, b, and g) are key regulators of mitochondrial respiration
that are downregulated in the failing heart, yet the molecular mechanisms regulating their expression and activity
remain largely unknown. In preliminary studies we have identified a novel molecular pathway that promotes the
expression of ERRb, and ERRg in cardiomyocytes, and define a new heart failure pathway linking chronic stress
to impairment of mitochondrial oxidative respiration. Our unexpected results demonstrate that the tumor
suppressor protein Neurofibromin 2 (NF2) promotes proper metabolic function, and that cardiac deletion of NF2
predisposes the heart to pathological remodeling and failure in response to LV pressure overload stress.
Transcriptome profiling of cardiac deficient NF2 cKO hearts indicated downregulation of metabolic pathways and
decreased expression/activity of ERRb and ERRg. Using a proteomics-based approach, we identified the
transcription factor Zscan21 as an interacting partner of NF2 and a novel positive regulator of metabolic gene
expression and mitochondrial oxidative respiration in cardiomyocytes. Therefore, we hypothesize that
endogenous NF2 engages the transcription factor Zscan21 to positively regulate expression of ERRb
and ERRg and promote energy production during pressure overload stress in the heart. The objectives of
the current application are to further define the clinical role of this pathway, and to elucidate the molecular
mechanisms by which NF2 regulates expression of myocardial ERRb and ERRg and prevents energy deficit.
These objectives will be accomplished in 3 aims. In Aim1, we will establish evidence of NF2 as an important and
novel mediator of cardiac metabolic coupling and energy production during the initial and late phases of pressure
overload stress. In Aim2, we will investigate in detail the molecular interaction between NF2 and Zscan21 and
determine the ability of Zscan21 to regulate expression of ERRb and ERRg, mitochondrial oxidative respiration,
and energy production in cardiomyocytes. In Aim3, we will determine the therapeutic potential of normalizing
cardiac NF2 for treatment in the pressure overload model of HFrEF. The long-term objective of this project is to
define mechanistic events that mediate mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction in heart failure and identify potential
candidates for new therapeutic strategies targeting early stages of heart failure."

 Chronic pain is pain that persists past the normal time of healing. 1.5 billion people
worldwide suffer from chronic pain and this number continues to increase as the elderly population
grows, the prevalence of diabetes rises, and cancer survival rates improve. Chronic pain not only
severely impacts daily quality of life for many patients, it also places a heavy socioeconomic
burden on society. Due to the limited number of efficacious treatment options available, chronic
pain is often treated with opioids despite the risk of addiction and side effects. Unfortunately, the
prescribing of opioids to treat chronic pain has largely fueled the current opioid epidemic.
Therefore, there is an urgent and clear unmet need for non-addictive alternative analgesics for
the treatment of chronic pain. The push to develop specific and non-addictive alternative
painkillers has brought interest to a particular sodium channel, NaV1.7, shown to be important for
pain sensing. Gain-of-function mutations in NaV1.7 are associated with a disorder characterized
by intense burning pain in the extremities: primary erythromelalgia. Conversely, loss-of function
of NaV1.7 results in the inability to feel pain. Therefore, inhibiting NaV1.7 can be an effective
method of reducing pain and treat erythromelalgia patients. To accomplish this, we designed
epigenetic modulators to repress expression of NaV1.7. Rather than making permanent edits to
the genome, these epigenetic modulators will transiently inhibit expression of NaV1.7. By targeting
NaV1.7 at the DNA-level, we can achieve specific and long-lasting modulation of NaV1.7, with
better pharmacokinetics prospects than RNA- and protein-targeting approaches. In this study, we
propose to optimize these epigenetic modulators as well as their delivery in order to achieve high
specificity and efficacy. In addition, we will evaluate our optimized modulators in small-scale
manufacturing studies as well as toxicological studies in a large animal model. The result of this
study will be an optimized gene therapy that is not only non-addictive and efficacious for treatment
of chronic pain but also highly specific and long-lasting."

should they be deployed to cause mass casualties. Sulfur mustard, a powerful ocular vesicant
causes irreversible corneal damage affecting the epithelium and stroma, as well as the abundant
network of corneal sensory nerves. Despite many studies that have examined damaging
mechanisms to the epithelium and stroma caused by vesicants, little is known regarding how
corneal nerves degenerate in this injury paradigm. This has led to a critical unmet medical need
as no therapeutic is available to protect or regenerate the vulnerable corneal nerves from such
injuries. Evidence from both human exposures and animal models of vesicant-injury reveal acute
ocular pain and chronic loss of corneal sensation manifest but their mechanisms have not been
investigated. Corneal axons are ensheathed by Schwann cells (SCs), a glial cell type that
provides trophic support to axons. In animal models of injury conducted in other peripheral
organs, SCs can actively regenerate and support the regeneration of damaged axons. Here we
hypothesize that a similar axonal-supportive role may be anticipated for corneal SCs (cSCs) in
vesicant injury. This gives an opportunity to pursue an innovative strategy to identify novel
druggable targets in cSCs. We interrogated molecular and biological pathway information gained
from our cSC-single cell RNA seq analysis and identified novel targets and biomarkers. Using a
genetically labeled SC mouse model subjected to injury experiments, we have also gained
important insight into the dynamic relationships of cSC and axons over acute and chronic stages
of injury. This model and targeting the candidate target in cSCs have provided us preliminary
data to support the idea that cSC could be targeted for axonal regeneration. In the proposed
study, we now choose FDA approved drugs for testing to illuminate the most effective method of
use that could support rapid and widespread application in any urgency. Because current
information is lacking whether these drug candidates have therapeutic efficacy in the paradigm
axonal regeneration over acute and chronic stages of vesicant injury, we include studies of
extended use. Lastly, in this innovative exploratory grant proposal we will define a new
therapeutic countermeasure against vesicant injury that exploits a combination treatment regimen
that can restore corneal refractive function and also help to regenerate corneal sensation."

 We request funds to purchase a Bruker Biospin Corp. Q-Band Elexsys E580 Pulse EPR
Spectrometer (Pulse EPR) to enable structural dynamics studies of proteins and their complexes and
the training of students and researchers. To maximize sensitivity, this instrument is equipped with a
300 W TWT Q-band pulse amplifier, ER5106QT-II resonator, SpinJet AWG, and Stinger cryogen-free
low-temperature system. The high sensitivity of the requested pulse EPR enables us to support projects
from user communities that are not feasible otherwise. In addition, combined with our current pulse
EPR instrument, having access to a second pulse EPR with enhanced sensitivity and capabilities is
essential, not only to manage our throughput, but also to serve as a regional pulse EPR facility for the
state of Missouri and nearby states. DEER spectroscopy as a powerful pulse EPR technique provides
an effective nanometer distance ruler to measure conformational changes in biomacromolecules under
relevant physiological conditions. With increasing technological advances in this ensemble-oriented
method, atomic resolution structural information can be directly linked to conformational sampling in
solution. Thus, mechanistic models for protein function can be obtained and DEER spectroscopy is
imperative to establish such models. The instrument will be housed in the Department of Biochemistry
and Molecular Biology at the Saint Louis University School of Medicine. The instrument will support
basic research of NIH-funded investigators at both Saint Louis University and Washington University in
St. Louis. We describe projects from 8 major and minor users with NIH grants that will benefit from the
requested instrumentation. The user projects span a range of membrane transporters, unconventional
protein secretion, blood clotting processes, biomolecular interactions in DNA repair and recombination,
immunothrombosis, regulation of protein translation, antimicrobial peptide transport, ligand-gated ion
channels, and membrane protein oligomerization. These projects focus on protein structure, functional
dynamics, and interactions, with majority involving low spin concentration samples. Thus, the high-
sensitivity Pulse EPR will be critical for these studies. Training for the Pulse EPR will be primarily
handled by members of the Dastvan research group who have more than a decade of experience using
the instrumentation, sample preparation, and data analysis. Users (graduate students, postdoctoral
fellows, and research associates) will be trained to independently use the Pulse EPR, and instrument
time will be determined using the existing scheduling system for departmental instrumentation. A local
advisory committee will provide oversight of the Pulse EPR and its operations. The high-sensitivity
Pulse EPR will be an integral component of the biophysical instrumentation portfolio at Saint Louis
University and will have a significant impact on the NIH-funded research in the region."

Three million people worldwide are exposed to organophosphates (OP), most of whom will survive with long
term side effects. These side effects include cognitive problems, mood disorders, and other neurological issues.
These side effects have underlaying molecular mechanisms which have yet to be uncovered. This knowledge
gap is a direct result of a lack of research tools available, however, two new tools have recently become available
to close this knowledge gap. The first is a novel mouse model, termed the KIKO mouse, which contains two key
genetic modifications: 1. knock out of the OP-binding serum carboxylesterase and 2. knock in of the human
acetylcholine esterase. These modifications produce a vastly improved rodent model of OP intoxication. The
other is matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). MALDI MSI
combines the power of mass spectrometry with spatial resolution. Briefly, discrete mass spectrometry
experiments are generated across a fresh-frozen tissue section to generate ion density maps of metabolites,
neurotransmitters, lipids, and N-glycans. These two novel and powerful tools will allow for unprecedented
molecular information on the short- and long-term effects of OP intoxication. We hypothesize that OP intoxication
generates significant molecular changes in neurotransmitters, metabolites, lipids, and N-glycans. Our preliminary
data shows significant differences in metabolites, neurotransmitters, and lipid oxidation in KIKO mice fifteen
minutes post-exposure. Literature data supports changes in N-glycans associated with neuroinflammation. To
test this hypothesis, in Aims 1 and 2, we will expose KIKO mice to 1xLD50 of sarin followed by the currently
fielded countermeasure 2-PAM and atropine. Control animals will be given an equivalent volume of water for
both exposure and treatment. Animals will be euthanized at 24 hours, 3-, 6-, and 12-weeks post exposure for
analysis of metabolites, neurotransmitters, lipids, and N-glycans from brain, spinal cord, and blood. In Aim 3 we
will expose pregnant KIKO mice to 1xLD50 of sarin followed by the currently fielded countermeasure. Dames will
be allowed to continue their pregnancy and the offspring will be euthanized at early adult (8 weeks), mature adult
(14 to 16 weeks), mid-life (40 weeks) and geriatric (78 weeks) of age for analysis by MALDI MSI. Brains, spines,
and blood will be collected for analysis of metabolites, neurotransmitters, lipids, and N-glycans. From these data
we will generate novel targets in the treatment of OP intoxication and its long term side effects."
10851408,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Translation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) into proteins by the ribosome and the rest of the translation
machinery (TM) is a fundamental step in gene expression that is central to life. It is perhaps not surprising,
then, that the bacterial TM is a proven target for the development of new antibiotics and that many human
diseases have been causally linked to dysregulation of the human TM. Consequently, the mechanisms of
translation and translational control in bacteria and eukaryotes remain under intense investigation. Over the
past two decades, structural studies have revealed the large-scale structural rearrangements the TM
undergoes during protein synthesis. Unfortunately, the size, complexity, and conformational flexibility of the TM
have greatly impeded studies of these dynamics, significantly limiting our understanding of how they contribute
to the mechanisms of translation and translational control. Nonetheless, using a combination of single-
molecule fluorescence and structural techniques, we and others have characterized the dynamics of the core
steps of translation by the bacterial TM. Despite these accomplishments, critical gaps in our understanding
remain, particularly with regard to whether and how the dynamics of these core steps are modulated as part of
mechanisms of many biomedically important translational control strategies. To fill these gaps, we will use a
combination of single-molecule fluorescence, structural, and biochemical approaches to investigate how the
dynamics of the TM are steered to execute several fundamental translational control strategies that act during
initiation and elongation stages of translation in bacteria. In the case of translation initiation, we will investigate
how essential protein initiation factors (IFs) modulate the conformational dynamics of the ribosomal small
subunit and use conformational switching strategies to ensure the fidelity with which a ribosomal complex
correctly assembles at the start codon of the mRNA to be translated. In the case of translation elongation, we
will focus on ribosomal frameshifting and ribosome rescue. Ribosomal frameshifting, whereby the TM slips
backward or forward by one or more nucleotides on the mRNA, may be utilized at specific mRNA locations to
correct mutations that would otherwise result in production of an aberrant protein or to drive the synthesis of
multiple proteins from a single mRNA. Specialized TM components have evolved to induce frameshifting at
these specific locations, and our proposed studies of these features promise to reveal the still-elusive
mechanisms that underlie frameshifting. Using analogous approaches, we will also investigate how ribosome
rescue factors modulate the dynamics of the TM as part of the mechanisms through which they recognize and
rescue translationally compromised ribosomes. These studies will provide structure-based mechanistic models
of ribosome rescue systems that can inform the development of next generation small-molecule antibiotics.
Using a yeast in vitro translation system we have recently developed, we will expand these studies to include
eukaryotic-specific aspects of related translational control strategies in eukaryotes."

Ischemic heart disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The lost cardiomyocytes are
replaced with fibrous scar tissue, which leads to maladaptive remodeling, contractile dysfunction, and progresses
to congestive heart failure. Stem cell transplantation offers a great potential to repair and possibly regenerate
damaged myocardium, thus multiple adult stem/progenitors have been explored. However, the critical barriers
in stem cell therapy for cardiac regeneration are the lack of long-term survival, insufficient maturation, and
unsuccessful coupling and alignment of grafted cardiomyocytes to the host tissue. This project aims to address
these critical limitations through integration of genetically engineered stem cells and electrically conductive
nanoengineered hydrogel biomaterials. Specifically, we will develop human engineered heart tissues (EHTs)
and explore a new therapeutic approach which leverages the capacity of gold nanorods (GNRs) and hydrogel
micro-topographies to induce electrical conductivity, cell maturation and alignment within the EHTs. In addition,
we will take the advantage of our recently established techniques to induce proliferation and survival
cardiomyocytes within the EHTs. Furthermore, we will investigate whether co-culture of isogenic human induced
pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSCs-CMs), endothelial cells (hiPSCs-ECs), smooth
muscle cells (hiPSCs-SMCs), and cardiac fibroblasts (hiPSCs-CFs) within the engineered heart tissue promote
angiogenesis, engraftment and tissue contractility. Moreover, the efficacy and safety of these novel EHTs,
developed in this project, will be evaluated in the preclinical acute rat and chronic pig models of ischemic heart
disease, which could potentially aid in clinical trials in treating MI patients."

There is an urgent need for new therapies and approaches for treating antibiotic-resistant bacterial
infections. One promising, but underdeveloped approach called phage therapy aims to use the
viruses that infect bacteria, called bacteriophages (or just phages). Although there have been a
handful of case studies reporting success, including for the treatment of ESKAPE pathogens of most
dire concern, the long-term efficacy and prospects for wide-spread use of phage therapy remains
highly uncertain. A key challenge is that bacteria often harbor potent anti-phage defense mechanisms
that enable them to resist or overcome viral infection. These anti-phage mechanisms have emerged
from the long-standing, fierce coevolutionary battle between bacteria and phages, with a molecular
'arms race' leading bacteria to evolve diverse mechanisms for defending themselves and phages, in
turn, evolving counter-defense strategies. The anti-phage arsenal of bacteria includes restriction-
modification (RM) and CRISPR-Cas systems. In recent years computational studies have identified
dozens of additional systems, but these studies have critical limitations, and our own experimental
studies have indicated that there are dozens, and likely hundreds, of additional systems still to be
discovered. By developing and applying a powerful, high-throughput functional selection procedure,
we aim to identify the anti-phage systems present in a diverse collection of 1,500+ strains of E. coli,
including a range of pathogenic strains. We will screen for defense against a panel of 10 different
coliphages. Bioinformatic analyses, particularly homology detection and structural predictions, will be
done to assess the conservation, genomic context, and predicted biochemical functions of the newly
identified systems. Thus, our work will lay the foundation for detailed molecular studies of the diverse
new systems identified. As with prior studies of anti-phage defense, we anticipate that the new
systems will drive the discovery of new molecular mechanisms, which may, in turn, form the
foundation of a new generation of precision molecular tools. It has also become clear in recent years
that many cell autonomous components of eukaryotic innate immunity have distant homologs in
bacteria. As such, our work may also reveal evolutionarily conserved facets of immunity across the
kingdoms of life. Finally, the methodology developed will be broadly applicable to virtually any
bacterial pathogen, work that we anticipate will inform ongoing and future efforts to develop phages as
therapeutic agents."

 This is an application for the acquisition of a Bruker NEO console and 1H/19F-detect, 13C,15N-
decouple 5 mm EUZ cryoprobe to replace the nearly 20-year-old console and cryoprobe of the
existing 700 MHz NMR spectrometer in the shared-use University of Pittsburgh Department of
Structural Biology high-field NMR facility. The requested console and cryoprobe will enable
reliable acquisition of high-quality high-sensitivity spectra, both on purified biomolecules in
solution and labeled biomolecules in living cells. The instrument requested is configured with four
independent radiofrequency channels and includes the capability for high sensitivity detection of
19F, an area of increasing emphasis among our user group. The need for the state-of-the-art 700
MHz spectrometer is justified based on the cutting-edge biomedical research, most of which is NIH-
funded, conducted by multiple investigators, and cannot be supported by the existing lower field
NMR instruments nor the only other high-field instrument dedicated for biomolecular NMR in the
greater Pittsburgh area, a nearly 20-year-old 800 MHz spectrometer that is experiencing an
increasing number of failures. The proposed state-of-the-art 700 MHz spectrometer will provide
capabilities for structural and dynamics analysis of a wide variety of biological systems and will
enable the investigators of this proposal to carry out their current NIH-supported research and to
take the existing projects to a new level. The spectrometer will also be critical for training PhD
students, most of whom receive their training through the joint University of Pittsburgh/Carnegie
Mellon University Molecular Biophysics and Structural Biology Graduate Program. Finally, having
this resource on campus will permit us to generate new collaborations with institutions in the State
of Pennsylvania and beyond, to attract talented new investigators at all ranks to the University of
Pittsburgh, and to train the diverse population of graduate and postdoctoral researchers for the
biomedical work-force in the interdisciplinary fields of structural biology, biophysics, and biomaterials."
10843204,"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are essential modulators of transcription and translation frequently dysregulated
in cancer. We recently systematically interrogated RBP dependencies in a number of human cancers using a
comprehensive CRISPR/Cas9 domain-focused screen targeting RNA-binding domains (RBDs) of 490 classical
RBPs. This uncovered a network of physically interacting RBPs upregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
and crucial for maintaining physiological RNA splicing and AML survival. Genetic targeting of one key member
of this network, RBM39, repressed cassette exon inclusion and promoted intron retention within mRNAs
encoding HOXA9 targets as well as in other RBPs preferentially required in AML. Fortuitously, it has recently
been described that a class of clinically validated anti-cancer sulfonamide compounds (including the drugs
indisulam and E7820) mediate RBM39 degradation as their dominant cellular mechanism of action. This
occurs via novel interactions between these compounds and the DCAF15 adapter protein of the CUL4/Ddb1
ubiquitin ligase complex with RBM39 as a neo-substrate. Treatment of AML cells with such compounds in
vitro and in vivo resulted in similar lethal cellular effects due to perturbations in RNA splicing. The effects of
RBM39 loss on splicing resulted in preferential lethality of spliceosomal mutant AML, providing a novel strategy
for treatment of AML bearing recurrent mutations in RBPs that regulated splicing.
Overall these data identify RBM39 as central to a network of functionally and physically interacting RBPs
upregulated in AML over normal hematopoietic precursors and required for AML maintenance. Despite these
insights we do not yet understand the basis for the cell- and context-specific roles of RBM39 in malignant
versus normal hematopoietic cells. We also do not understand the exact mechanisms by which RBM39 loss
results in eradication of AML. We hypothesize that RBM39 is differentially required in malignant versus
normal hematopoietic cells, may be differentially required depending on the precise stage of
hematopoiesis, and will be required for leukemia initiation as well as maintenance. These hypotheses
will be addressed in two Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine the biological role of RBM39 in normal and
malignant hematopoiesis. In this Aim, we will utilize a novel genetic model for genetic deletion of RBM39 in
vivo in a cell- and time-specific manner to rigorously dissect the roles of RBM39 in malignant versus normal
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell populations. Aim 2 will identify the mechanistic basis for cell-type and
disease-specific roles for RBM39 in normal and malignant hematopoietic cells. In this Aim we will compare the
direct RNA binding targets and effects of RBM39 loss on splicing across normal and malignant hematopoietic
cells. In addition, we will evaluate a potential novel for RBM39 in transcriptional elongation by the FACT
complex, identified by our preliminary studies as an interactor of RBM39."

The goal of this new Functional Genomics Training Program (FGTP) is to provide
predoctoral students with an integrative training that encompasses basic research,
bioinformatics, clinical genetics, and ethics. Genomics has become the basis for the study
of human genetic disease, and we see a critical need for a formalized training program,
especially as interest in human genomics and precision medicine has grown and continues
to grow among students and the applicant pool at CWRU. Through this integrative model,
we aim to empower students with a specialized skillset critical for ushering in and shaping
the new era of precision medicine in both an efficient and responsible manner. To
accomplish this training goal, we assembled a well-funded cohesive group of mentors with
relevant genomics expertise in the following five key focus areas: (1) Mechanisms and
Treatment of Human Genetic Disease, (2) Chromatin, Regulatory Elements, and RNA, (3)
Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, (4) Cancer Genetics, (5) Clinical Genetics, Genetic
Counseling and Ethics. Training will include coursework and hands on training in functional
genomics and bioinformatics, along with clinically oriented training in which students
shadow clinicians, observe genetic counseling sessions, and follow clinical diagnostic
cases. Furthermore, as it is imperative to ensure that we train an ethically and socially
responsible next generation of biomedical scientists, our training model will also incorporate
ethics and the potential societal implications of functional genomics research, including
genome editing. CWRU, with two key Departments that recently procured large
reinvestments (Genetics and Genome Sciences, Population and Quantitative Health
Sciences), a Clinical Center for Human Genetics, a Genetic Counseling Program, Genetics
Diagnostic Labs, and two major hospitals (University Hospitals and the Cleveland Clinic), all
located within a 1 mile radius, provides an ideal training hub for our program. We believe
that this new program will have a significant and sustained impact on graduate education at
CWRU by serving as a vehicle for uniting functional genomics research across the
University and greater Northeast Ohio."
10843282,"Abstract
 In longitudinal neuroimaging studies, modeling within-subject variation across time offers insights about time-
dependent effects and causal relationships in brain changes related to neurodevelopment, neurodegeneration, or
disease progression. Uncovering and quantifying the multi-way relationship across modalities, including environ-
mental, *omics, imaging, and neurocognitive data, will help better understand the mechanisms behind complex
diseases, such as the impact of substance abuse on neurodevelopment and Alzheimer's Disease. Considering
genetic, demographic, and phenotypic traits, it is crucial to characterize disease heterogeneity, such as sex-
related differences, for precision medicine. Though methods to perform longitudinal and path analysis of univari-
ate data can be applied to individual data elements, limited methods are available directly for data with structured
constraints and integrated analysis of large datasets. The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop novel
statistical methodologies to analyze longitudinal high-dimensional data with mathematical constraints and novel
generalized path analysis methodologies to integrate complex data collected from multiple sources, with appli-
cation to the study of neurodevelopment/neurodegeneration and related mental disorders. The overall objective
is to elucidate longitudinal effects on brain structure and function, to characterize population heterogeneity, to
understand the role of different modalities and mechanisms, and to provide guidance on personalized early
prevention/intervention strategies. The challenges of longitudinal integrated mechanistic modeling of multiview
data include (i) longitudinal modeling of variables with complex structure (e.g. positive deﬁnite matrices), (ii)
high dimensionality and heterogeneity, (iii) delineation of multiple pathways, and (iv) development of large-scale
and computationally efﬁcient algorithms. To address these, three speciﬁc aims are proposed: (1) develop novel
regression frameworks for multiple longitudinal, high-dimensional covariance matrix outcomes with predictors
across modalities; (2) develop big-data path analysis with longitudinal, high-dimensional, complex variables;
(3) develop statistical methodologies to characterize individual growth trajectories of complex variables. Aim 1
introduces longitudinal models with covariance matrices as the outcome to investigate changes in data struc-
ture and/or characteristics at a network level. Aim 2 innovates path regularization and integrated optimization
criteria for high-dimensional structured data to identify markers and search for causal pathways under longitudi-
nal settings. Aim 3 develops methodologies to guide personalized prevention/intervention strategies. To foster
dissemination, repeatability, reproducibility, and replicability of scientiﬁc ﬁndings, open-source software will be
developed. The proposed research is innovative because it proposes methodologies to perform longitudinal and
path analysis for high-dimensional data with complex and speciﬁc structures collected from multiple domains.
The proposed research is signiﬁcant because it will enrich the understanding of the human brain and guide
practitioners to promote well-being in adolescent and elderly populations."

Sepsis is life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to microbial infection, and is a
global healthcare problem with high incidence and mortality rates, responsible for 20% of deaths worldwide. In
the USA, sepsis is the most common cause of death among hospitalized patients and the total hospital costs of
treating sepsis are estimated at more than $24 billion annually. The high mortality rate of sepsis is due in part to
delays in diagnosis and management, as a result of its initial atypical and nonspecific symptoms and lack of early
and sensitive diagnostic test. The goal of this program is to develop an ultra-sensitive, highly selective, and
portable solid-state nanopore sensing platform to profile a panel of sepsis protein biomarkers in clinical samples
instead of one specific biomarker as currently used in the clinical setting to provide more comprehensive
parameters for accurate diagnosis of sepsis at the early stage and monitoring the treatment prognosis.
 Aim 1: Utilize procalcitonin (PCT) as a model protein to demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing our
proposed solid-state nanopore sensing strategy, which takes advantage of a combination of magnetic beads,
sandwich immunoassay, DNA reporter probe cascade and amplification, and DNA-functionalized
gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), as an effective generic approach for the sensitive and accurate detection of proteins
in clinical samples. To optimize the sensor sensitivity, the effects of various factors such as incubation time,
denature temperature, AuNPs diameter, DNA reporter probe length, nanopore dimension, etc. on PCT detection
will be examined by using a silicon nitride nanopore. Furthermore, we will construct dose-response curve for
PCT, and perform selectivity study & simulated serum sample analysis.
 Aim 2: Build on the nanopore-based PCT detection methodology developed in aim #1 to develop a
nanopore-based multiplexing sensing platform for simultaneous detection and quantification of multiple sepsis
protein biomarkers. An array of seven silicon nitride nanopore sensors will be constructed and used to
quantitatively detect PCT, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, presepsin (soluble CD14 subtype),
tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in protein mixtures at various concentrations.
 Aim 3: Analyze clinical serum samples. To evaluate the effectiveness of utilizing our developed solid-
state nanopore sensing platform for accurate sepsis diagnosis and prognosis, the multiplexing nanopore sensor
array developed in aim 2 will be used to analyze 120 clinical serum samples from sepsis patients at different
stages and healthy controls, as well as from sepsis patients who received antimicrobial therapy. The
concentrations of PCT, CRP, IL-1, IL-6, presepsin, TNF-α and LPS in these serum samples will be determined.
In comparison, these samples will additionally be analyzed using ELISA detection kits."

(CGMP)
The Current Good Manufacturing Practice Facility (cGMP) supports access to state-of-the-art cell
production, equipment and regulatory knowledge to facilitate the development and execution of cell therapy
clinical trials for University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC) investigators. In
the last review, the cGMP Facility was a Subcore of the Human Immunologic Monitoring-cGMP (HIM-cGMP)
Facility. The cGMP Subcore was initiated as a Developing Core in 2001, supported by UCCCC
Developmental Funds and additional philanthropic funds. In 2011, the HIM Facility formally merged with the
cGMP Facility, but as a result of center-wide strategic planning, the HIM-cGMP has now been divided into
two separate cores in this renewal application. A new addition to the cGMP facility is a Vector production
suite (March 2023) for clinical-grade retro/lentiviral vectors and oncolytic viruses, which is led by Richard
Koya, MD, PhD. The primary objective of the cGMP Facility is to provide investigators with services and
expertise for the manufacture of cGMP compliant cellular therapy products e.g., Dendritic cells, engineered
T cells and preparation of agents for administration to patients. The cGMP Facility has the requisite scientific,
technical and regulatory expertise and operational efficiencies in cell-based immunotherapies, to implement
Phase I and II clinical trials. In the reporting period, cGMP supported 24 clinical trials and 19 unique UCCCC
members (5% MMC, 5% CPC, 5% IC, 84% CET), meeting the strategic objectives of UCCCC.
The cGMP facility has administered (injections and infusions) over 385 doses of cellular products into
patients, with zero contaminated products over the past 5 years. Our future goal is to increase the number
of UCCCC investigators utilizing the cGMP by optimizing several new processes and procedures and
ultimately reducing cost. In this regard, cGMP plans to: (i) optimize automation, purification, and expansion
methodologies. Recently, the cGMP has invested in automated fractionation and cell wash equipment, i.e.,
CliniMacs Prodigy and the LOVO. With this investment, the Therapeutic Cell Processing (TCP) facility will
be able to (i) make the manufacturing process more uniform, and to increase the TCP production capabilities;
(ii) increase the scope of cellular therapy products that can be manufactured by investing in GE Wave,
SEPAX C Pro, and Sefia (which will allow for the automated, closed and dynamic manufacturing of
diversified cell therapy products); and (iii) as the need for TCP manufacturing expertise increases, TCP will
furnish the FLEX room (fourth manufacturing cleanroom), with standard cell processing equipment."
10823865,"Abstract
Alcohol abuse and dependence are global health concerns associated with numerouus comorbidities. Under
normal conditions glucose is the primary fuel for brain energy metabolism, but when people drink, the liver
converts most of the alcohol to acetate, and the brain utilizes that acetate, partially replacing glucose
consumption. Studies of hypoglycemia in diabetes and in starvation show that the transport and utilization of
monocarboxylic acids are enhanced by hypoglycemia and by elevations in monocarboxlyic acids, and in single
occipital volumes of the brain, we see alterations in brain acetate oxidation that are associated with drinking.
Those alterations parallel certain changes that are also seen with cortisol and possibly regional brain volume
loss. We now have the capacity to map brain acetate oxidation throughout the brain using a novel method
called Deuterium Metabolic Imaging (DMI) together with administration of deuterated acetate, and we plan to
test for relationships of regional brain acetate oxidation with cortisol, stress, alcohol-related behavior, and
regional brain volumes. We hypothesize that frequent, intermittent exposure to elevated acetate can increase
brain acetate oxidation globally and regionally, and that the near constant elevations of acetate in alcohol
dependence has the opposite effect. We further propose that acetate oxidation is associated with brain
volume deficits and cortisol levels and turnover. Our preliminary data support these hypotheses, and in this
proposal we plan to test whether the condition is a state or a trait, by assessing if acetate consumption
normalizes in alcohol-dependent people who have been sober for more than six months. If the hypotheses of
this project are supported, the fuel-generation aspect of alcohol may provide a novel reward mechanism that
promotes the continuation of binging in heavy, non-dependent drinkers and may promote prolongation of
binges for caloric benefits. In dependent individuals, a reduction in the ability to oxidize acetate may
exacerbate symptoms of withdrawal, which raises the possiblity of adjunct therapies of monocarboxylic acids
like ketone bodies for detoxification. Because acetate is a significant contributor to cortisol synthesis, we will
check for relationships between brain acetate oxidation and cortisol turnover using blood samples obtained
during the DMI sessions."
10823771,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The primary goal of this proposal is to provide a framework of methodologically-diverse, and clinically-inclined,
investigative training that will prepare the principal investigator for a successful career as a translational
physician-scientist. In addition to MD/PhD-specific professional development and expanded clinical/translational
training, much of this preparation will come from technical education gained from the execution of this proposal’s
research aims. These aims seek to broadly understand the placental correlates of fetal congenital heart defects
(CHDs) in pregnancies affected by pregestational maternal diabetes mellitus (DM). It is recognized that the
placenta plays a critical role in the development of fetal CHDs in early pregnancy, although this role is poorly
understood. DM-affected pregnancies also have a pronounced phenotype of placental dysfunction, although the
mediators of this also remain unknown. Additionally, DM-affected pregnancies are at substantially elevated risk
of developing fetal CHDs and, for certain subtypes of CHD, carry an RR as high as 13.8. These CHDs represent
a large percentage of critical and surgery-necessitating defects and are particularly high-burden, as they come
with risk of additional malformations, neonatal hypoglycemia, preterm birth, and other perinatal complications.
These complications, many of which are also seen in DM pregnancies, come downstream of cyclical
exacerbations of placental dysfunction due to CHD-induced fetal hemodynamic changes. Given this,
investigation of the pronounced changes in placental function seen in DM and/or CHD-affected pregnancies
could yield extremely impactful information for both diagnostic and prognostic management of CHDs in diabetic
pregnancies. The identification of pathway-level molecular changes, and their clinical associations, in
pregnancies affected by DM, fetal CHDs, and both (DM+CHD) will produce novel and foundational information
that could change the paradigm of perinatal care in these pregnancies. The overarching hypothesis of this project
is that similar profiles of angiogenic and inflammatory molecular dysfunction, and resulting clinical pathology, will
be observed in both maternal DM-affected and fetal CHD-affected pregnancies, and that this dysfunction will be
particularly exacerbated in DM-affected pregnancies that also develop fetal CHD. This hypothesis will be tested
via two aims. One aim will use large-scale institutional health data to assess the perinatal risk of common
obstetric and neonatal complications in DM+CHD pregnancies relative to those affected by either pathology in
isolation. The other will characterize the cell type-specific molecular dysfunction of DM, CHD, and DM+CHD
placentas using high-throughput RNA sequencing, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. In completing
this training plan, and the scientific aims it includes, the applicant will receive critical didactic and experiential
training necessary to achieve the long-term goal of their career, which is to multimodally improve the prevention
and management of CHD- and DM-affected pregnancies, through improved perinatal risk-assessment, targeted
prenatal therapy/supplementation, or serum biomarker identification for early diagnosis."
10823777,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) is a major cause of early onset dementia and patients can develop a wide range
of symptoms including behavioral changes and language impairments. Heterozygous mutations in the
progranulin gene (GRN) result in haploinsufficiency of the protein and cause FTD with TDP-43 pathology. TDP-
43 is a RNA binding protein that, in disease states, mislocalizes to the cytoplasm and forms insoluble inclusions.
All FTD-GRN patients develop TDP-43 pathology, however it is not understood how partial loss of progranulin
promotes TDP-43 mislocalization and aggregation. Progranulin heterozygous mice (Grn+/–) are the genetic
model of FTD-GRN and develop age dependent behavioral abnormalities, but do not develop TDP-43 pathology.
This project uses Grn+/– mice crossed with human TDP-43 transgenic mice (hTDP+) to investigate whether
progranulin insufficiency results in TDP-43 dysregulation. Initial studies of the Grn+/–:hTDP+ mice show a severe
impairment of social dominance behavior and an increase in insoluble TDP-43 in the medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC), a region critical for normal social dominance behavior. Additionally, preliminary studies suggest that
there may be impairments in TDP-43-dependent splicing and autoregulation in the Grn+/–:hTDP+ mice. My
overarching hypothesis is that the synergistic effects of progranulin insufficiency and TDP-43 overexpression on
social dominance behaviors are due to TDP-43 dysregulation in the mPFC. This proposal will test two aims: 1)
Determine if progranulin insufficiency promotes TDP-43 mislocalization and dysregulation in the mPFC and 2)
Determine if impaired social dominance behaviors are driven by hTDP expression in the mPFC. As behavioral
changes are a major feature of FTD, determining the role of TDP-43 in the mPFC could be vital for developing
future therapeutics. The overall goal of the training plan is to instruct the PI in neurodegeneration research and
provide a solid foundation for a successful career as a physician scientist. A project based in translational
approaches, while focused on a disease-oriented pathogenesis, is the ideal training environment for any aspiring
physician scientist. Included in the training plan are experiences that help the PI: 1) gain competence in a variety
of techniques in neurobiology 2) collaborate with other scientists, 3) develop hypothesis-driven research, 4)
present data in a written and oral format, 5) effectively integrate research with clinic, and 6) responsibly conduct
research."

Molecular mechanisms that regulate the degradation of dying cells
 During metazoan development and adulthood, many cells undergo cell suicide (apoptosis). In addition,
pathological stresses often induce the necrosis of cells. Phagocytosis is a “cell-eating-cell” event in which dying
and senescent cells, damaged axons and synapses, and invading pathogens are internalized by phagocytes
and degraded inside phagosomes. Swift clearance of dying cells in mammals is critical for tissue remodeling,
the resolution of the wound area, and the suppression of harmful inflammatory and autoimmune responses.
Cancer research and treatment are also related to the clearance of dying cells. We have been studying the
phagocytosis of cells that undergo apoptosis, a genetically controlled process of cell suicide in the nematode
C. elegans. We have discovered many proteins that facilitate the recognition, engulfment, and degradation of
dying cells. We have delineated several signaling pathways that drive each step of the dying cell-clearance
process. These include a pathway that initiates the maturation of phagosomes by promoting the fusion of
lysosomes to phagosomes. This pathway is driven by CED-1, a phagocytic receptor, and its downstream
adaptors and effectors. We believe what we learn from C. elegans can be translated to humans and impact
human health. Recently, we made two discoveries. (I) We found that the double-membrane autophagosomes,
which are known to help clear intracellular protein aggregates and damaged organelles through autophagy,
actively fuse to the single-membrane phagosomes and facilitate the degradation of the engulfed apoptotic
cells. We coin the term autophagosome-phagosome fusion (AP-fusion). Our findings reveal a novel crosstalk
between autophagy and phagosome processing. (II) We found that the precise temporal regulation of CED-1
on the surfaces of nascent phagosomes, which involves mechanisms that remove CED-1 from the
phagosomal membrane, is necessary for the initiation of maturation. Here we propose to deepen and broaden
our research premise by following these two discoveries. Investigate the novel mechanisms that regulate the
AP-fusion (Project 1), the phagosome-induced autophagosome biogenesis (Project 2), and the temporal
activation and inactivation of CED-1 on nascent phagosomes (Project 3). The outcome of the proposed
projects will shed light on our understanding of how intracellular organelles participate in cell-cell interaction
and further contribute to treating human diseases related to defects in phagocytosis and autophagy."
10842993,"Organs modulate their functions and forms to adapt to changing physiological needs and external
stimuli. Current understanding of organogenesis revealed how molecules and cells work together to build an
organ. The new scientific challenge is to understand how, at different life stages, an organ can maintain basic
epigenetic memory and still be able to respond to new stimuli to reach optimal performance. We think such
continuous interactions, or multi-scale modulation of organ adaptation, may exist in many organs using
similar fundamental principles. To this end, the avian integument provides a unique opportunity to explore
these principles because of its distinct patterns, regional specific morphology, quantitative control, and post-
natal cyclic regeneration. Together, these attributes provide a highly complex plumage pattern that can change
dynamically at different times and help birds successfully adapt to different environments. Thus, the avian
integument presents a platform to analyze how stem cells and their environmentally modulatable niches
interact to attain remarkably diverse, yet well-coordinated organ architectures. We will explore these novel
principles in two projects. Project 1, Multi-scale organ morphogenesis. There is multi-dimensional regulation
of organ size. To study the mechanistic control in depth, we will only focus on how feather length is regulated
in this proposal. Whether this regulation is intrinsically or extrinsically controlled will be probed with stem cell
behavior analyses including gene mis-expression and single-cell RNA analyses. We will compare feathers of
different lengths in different body positions, different physiological ages and in different chicken variants. We
will develop a model on how the feather length is regulated to achieve an almost mathematical relationship
with its neighbors. Project 2, Environmental adaptation of organ phenotype. We will study how birds use
molting / regenerative cycling to reset follicle niches and adult feather phenotypes through sex hormones and
seasonal changes. To study mechanistic control in-depth, here we will focus on two experimental procedures
(i) ovariectomizing female chickens, which converts sickle feathers to the male forms, and (ii) adding estradiol
to male chickens, which convert sickle feathers to female forms. The epigenetic profiles of stem cells, niches
and how they are altered by hormone status will be studied. This study will provide new knowledge on how an
organ adjusts its homeostasis for the best possible adaptation during each organism’s lifetime."
10842995,"There is an unmet need to obtain natural product-derived medicines in a scalable and reliable manner.
Natural products are small molecules produced by biological systems, but often in low quantities. Synthetic
biology promises to move the biosynthetic pathways of these medicinal small molecules from their native
producers into heterologous hosts such as bacteria and yeast or into a bioreactor, so that large-scale, low-cost,
industrial processes can be developed to produce them. The long-term goal of my research program is to
address the ultimate challenge in chemical biosynthesis, namely to precisely control the flow of electrons,
carbon, and energy. Over the past five years, we have made substantial strides toward this goal, by
establishing unnatural electron currency which operates in parallel to Nature's universal cofactor. This design
is inspired by Nature: Catabolism and anabolism, two opposing metabolic systems responsible for breaking
down and building up cell components, respectively, are insulated from each other because they each have a
designated redox cofactor, NAD and NADP, respectively. We have demonstrated that our unnatural cofactor
can indeed precisely channel reducing power only to the desired pharmaceutical producing reactions inside the
cells while silencing all side-reactions, effectively insulting the biosynthetic pathway from the host's complex
native metabolism. Importantly, we have also developed universal, high-throughput, growth-based selection
platforms to readily obtain enzymes that can use the unnatural cofactor. Through these efforts, general
enzyme design principles also start to emerge which paves the way for our proposed work in the next five year.
Through the MIRA support, we will develop methods to drastically improve the efficiency of the unnatural
cofactor technology; make it easy to adopt by bioengineering community; bring this technology to bear on
difficult high-reward biosynthesis challenges; broaden the category of unnatural metabolic currencies from
electron- to carbon- and energy-carriers and distill translatable design principles; use this project as a vehicle
to include and promote diverse STEM researchers at K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and post graduate
stages. The proposed work is transformative because it directly targets life's universal metabolic infrastructure
and therefore can have extremely broad impacts in biomedicine and synthetic biology."
10851776,"Project 2 Abstract
Circuit formation in developing human brain involves sequential steps of: (i) cell fate specification, (ii) proliferation
and regulation of precursor pool size, and (iii) migration of neural cells to their appropriate position to integrate
into local circuits. Young interneurons (IN) and oligodendrocyte precursors (OPCs) persist as immature yet
committed lineage cells for a protracted period of time during development, undergoing extensive migration and
late differentiation before integration into/and myelination of neural circuits in human developing brain. This
relatively long developmental time course means that they may be more vulnerable to neonatal injury. Our
findings in the prior cycle of this program highlighted novel stromal interactions of OPCs and IN with blood
vessels during development. We identified that OPCs use vasculature as a physical scaffold for migration in the
developing CNS (Tsai Science 2016 PMC5472053), that OPCs drive white matter angiogenesis in mouse brain
(Yuen Cell 2014 PMC4149873), and that migrating clusters of interneurons associate with the vasculature in the
human brain (Paredes Science 2016 PMC5436574). However, very little is understood about the cellular and
molecular mechanisms that underlie human OPC induced angiogenesis and IN perivascular migration, a
phenomenon unique to human brain development. What are the cellular mechanisms that underlie angiogenesis
directed by OL lineage in human brain? And how does the establishment of a vascular scaffold subsequently
mediate and regulate IN sub-type migration? This project seeks to understand mechanisms underlying these
processes in human neonatal brain. We will 1) evaluate factors involved in OPC interaction with endothelial tip
cells as well as the morphological interaction, identify candidate angiogenic pathways and novel tip cell markers
in human brain, and investigate dysfunction of OPC-tip cell interactions in human neonatal hypoxic injury. We
will 2) determine a functional role for OPC-encoded Wnt and VEGF ligands in orchestrating endothelial tip cell
angiogenesis and in resilience to hypoxic injury, and we will 3) identify the transcriptomic signature of vessel-
associated migrating IN in human neonatal brain, and determine whether diversity of vessel associated versus
non-vessel associated IN migration is a reflection on their developmental origin. Understanding the cellular
mechanisms mediating OPC-mediated angiogenesis and IN vessel-associated migration in human brain will not
only elucidate fundamental biological processes, but will provide insight into how dysregulation could occur in
preterm birth and term hypoxia and provide perspective for the planning for therapeutic interventions."

Neural circuits require precise placement of correct numbers of interneurons (INs). This delicate process is
derailed in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disease. Microglia, the brain resident macrophages,
influence many aspects of brain development, including genesis, migration and maturation of cortical
interneurons (cINs). In our preliminary study leading up to this proposal, we discovered diverse molecular and
cellular properties of human microglia in the developing forebrain and we found that specific molecularly-
defined subtypes are differentially distributed across brain regions. Furthermore, our results show that GPR56
expression defines a subset of human microglia and that deletion of murine microglial Gpr56 leads to a
significant reduction in the numbers of PV+ interneurons in specific brain region. However, the full scope of
microglia transcriptomic and functional heterogeneity, especially in the human brain, remains elusive. The
proposed research will establish the postnatal cellular and molecular heterogeneity of microglia in the human
caudal and medial ganglionic eminence with a specific focus on GPR56 in microglia. We hypothesize that
microglial GPR56 promotes interneuron development. To test this and corollary hypotheses, we will carry out
the following three aims: (1) Define microglia morphology, distribution, and their interactions with neural
progenitors (NPCs) and young neurons in the human GEs and the Arc (a unique cluster of migratory
interneurons found at birth in the vicinity of the human lateral ventricles); (2) Characterize microglial
transcriptomic heterogeneity in the developing hMGE, hCGE and the Arc; and (3) Investigate the cell-type-
specific function of microglial GPR56 in interneuron development using microglia-specific conditional knockout
mouse model. Most meaningfully, we are conducting our studies using both human brain tissues and
transgenic mouse models, to take advantage of the many manipulations that can be done in mice, but always
grounding our work in the human conditions we seek to understand. The success of the proposed research will
open a novel and important line of research into the origin of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism
and schizophrenia. Given the status of aGPCRs as drug targets, this line of research carries tremendous
translational potential. In particular, it is feasible to begin designing drugs that modify the action of GPR56
given the discovery of its crystal structure."

Progress toward UNAIDS testing and treatment targets has been slow in many global settings, including India,
where only 46% of the 2.1 million people who live with HIV (PLWH) are estimated to be virally suppressed.
This gap is especially pronounced among Key Populations (KP) who have much higher prevalence of HIV than
the general population, but lower rates of viral suppression, partly due to intersecting stigma. In this
application, we therefore seek to adapt and pilot test a comprehensive wellness program to address the
barriers to engagement in the HIV care continuum among men who have sex with men (MSM) and
transgender women (TGW) in India. The proposed adapted intervention is guided by a conceptual model that
integrates our India-specific HIV stigma model, which showed that stigma can delay care-seeking both directly
and indirectly, with the Minority Stress Model adapted for India by our Indian collaborator. The content
involves an adaptation of our earlier Chetana wellness adherence intervention which was found to successfully
improve adherence and viral suppression among mainstream Indian PLWH. Based on our initial formative
work, the adaptation includes added wellness group content and will be offered in a flexible format. It also uses
peer navigators (PN), rather than MA-level counselors, to deliver tailored support at mutually convenient times
and places. This PN model has been used successfully by our Indian collaborators and in our previous
research in South Africa to link and retain PLWH in care. The intervention is intended to break the link between
stigma and care seeking, which is especially important for KPs, who must deal with historically hostile legal
environments and substantial isolation that further reduces engagement in HIV preventive practices and
services. This application also takes advantage of India’s adoption of a universal test-and-treat policy, allowing
newly diagnosed KPs to be immediately engaged in HIV care, rather than having to wait until they meet CD4
eligibility criteria. Our Indo-US team has a long history of prior research collaborations as well as more than 20
years of work with key populations in this setting. We are thus uniquely positioned to conduct the proposed
research to address the following aims: 1) To engage community stakeholders in the adaptation and pilot
testing of the Chetana-PN wellness adherence intervention for use with Indian MSM and TGW who are living
with HIV and who are newly or insufficiently engaged in care. 2a) To assess in a small RCT the acceptability
and feasibility of the theoretically-guided, adapted intervention and to obtain preliminary effect size estimations
for the impact of the intervention on engagement in care, among MSM and TGW. 2b) To characterize
participant and navigator experiences in the Chetana-PN intervention and describe the practices that were
most successful at overcoming barriers to care with 25 participants who received the Chetana-PN intervention
and the peer navigators. These findings will subsequently be used to inform a future RCT designed to establish
the efficacy of this adapted Chetana-PN intervention for sexual minorities in India."

Uganda is one of 8 countries with the highest burden of cervical cancer (CXCA) among women living with HIV
(WLWH) with an HIV-attributable age-standardized incidence rate of 10–20 per 100,000. Strategies for Cervical
Cancer (CXCA) prevention include targeted Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, screening of women aged
25-49 years by visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) or HPV DNA testing, and precancer treatment by
cryotherapy or ablation. However, there is limited and sparse availability of and access to CXCA interventions
which is compounded by low-uptake of ‘screen and treat’ strategies. Scalable, affordable, point-of-care, clinically
proven novel interventions (including HPV self-sampling techniques, HPV molecular biomarker tests, precancer
diagnostics and imaging techniques, and ablative and excisional treatments) are imperative. Further, the
effectiveness of these novel clinically proven interventions remains unknown which limits implementation in
intended-use settings in the US and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). To support on-going efforts to
roll-out novel screen and treat strategies, the Makerere University Walter Reed Project (MUWRP) in partnership
with the U.S. Military HIV Research Program (MHRP) propose to participate in the HIV/Cervical Cancer
Prevention ‘CASCADE’ Clinical Trials Network as a UG1 Clinical Research Site (UG1 CRS) to implement
pragmatic clinical trials in Uganda. We will: 1) leverage MUWRP’s expertise and experience in clinical trials and
CXCA prevention among WLWH to provide valuable insight and input on study feasibility, clinical significance
and local context during concept and protocol development; 2) accrue CASCADE targets in a timely manner and
retain ≥ 95% of study participants leveraging MUWRP’s pluripotent experience, clinical research infrastructure
and resources; and 3) provide competent leadership to ensure procedural fidelity to protocols and all applicable
regulations and guidelines. MUWRP will also support UG1 Research Bases and U24 Coordination Center to
obtain ethical and regulatory approvals for CASCADE trials, and implement clinical trial protocols with fidelity.
MUWRP is an ideal and rational choice for a UG1 CRS as MUWRP has: 1) access to over 37,000 WLWH in
urban, semi-urban, and rural settings at 114 health facilities supported by MUWRP’s Comprehensive HIV/AIDS
Prevention, Care and Treatment in Central Uganda (CARE) program funded by the U.S. President's Emergency
Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR); 2) extensive experience conducting HIV clinical research and CXCA screening
and precancer treatment in the African Cohort Study, and CARE supported CXCA program; and 3) internationally
renowned scientists with experience and expertise in conducting clinical trials involving WLWH in Uganda and
other LMICs. MUWRP’s expertise and capacity will support all four research focus areas of the CASCADE
Network. MUWRP and MHRP will generate evidence that ultimately informs CXCA policy and screen and treat
strategies for WLWH."

The di-morphic commensal fungus Candida albicans causes severe bloodstream infection known as
disseminated candidiasis (candidiasis). Candidiasis is the 3rd most common nosocomial infection, with mortality
rates ~40-60%. Currently, there are no approved vaccines to this or any other fungi. Following systemic infection,
C. albicans hyphae invade and damage vital organs including kidney. Aggressive treatment with antifungal drugs
is hampered by challenges in early diagnosis, development of drug resistance, and a poor mechanistic
understanding of the renal protective immunity. In recent years, the proinflammatory cytokine Interleukin-17 (IL-
17) has emerged as a key player in antifungal defense. We discovered a surprising kidney tissue protective role
of IL-17 in candidiasis. The renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) undergo increased apoptosis following hyphal
invasion of the kidney. We demonstrate that RTECs undergo loss of mitochondrial membrane potential,
increased mitoROS production and Caspase3 activation in candidiasis, a phenotype aggravated in the absence
of IL-17RA signaling. Our preliminary data show that mice lacking IL-17 signaling in RTECs exhibit reduced renal
expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH):ubiquinone oxidoreductase iron-sulfur protein 4
(Ndufs4) in candidiasis, which is critical to prevent activation of apoptotic pathways. The overall goal of this
proposal is to determine the mechanisms of IL-17-mediated kidney tissue protection in candidiasis and ultimately
to utilize this knowledge for the treatment of kidney damage. To that end, we will use RTEC-specific deletion of
Ndufs4 to define the role for IL-17/Ndufs4 pathway in protecting RTECs from mitochondrial dysfunction and
apoptosis (Aim 1). We will interrogate the cellular signaling events downstream of IL-17 signaling in regulation
of Ndufs4 gene expression in mouse and human RTECs (Aim 2). Knowledge gained from these studies will
advance our understanding on the tissue protective function of IL-17 in infectious settings. Our long-term goal is
to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this devastating organ damaging infection."

This project's primary goal is to develop a non-invasive, extracellular vesicle (EV) therapy for maintaining
better cognitive and memory function in old age. The project proposes to examine the effectiveness of
intranasal (IN) administration of EVs generated from human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived
neural stem cells (hNSCs) for improving cognitive and memory function in a mouse model of aging. RNA-seq
and proteomic studies have confirmed the presence of miRNAs and proteins having neuroprotective,
antiinflammatory, and neurogenic properties in hNSC-EVs. Preliminary studies have suggested that IN
administration of hNSC-EVs results in their uptake by microglia and neurons in all brain regions and leads to
improved cognitive function in middle-aged mice, in association with diminished neuroinflammation,
adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) inhibition, enhanced autophagy, and improved neurogenesis. Therefore, the rationale for the
proposed approach is that the miRNA and protein cargo of hNSC-EVs would activate beneficial signaling
pathways in target cells such as microglia, neurons, and neural stem cells in the aged brain, which, in turn,
would reduce neuroinflammation, enhance neuronal function and neurogenesis, and thereby improve
cognitive and memory function. The project will test the hypothesis that IN administration of hNSC-EVs in
early or late middle age will maintain better cognitive function in old age, and hNSC-EV administration in old
age will reverse cognitive dysfunction. Furthermore, it is envisaged that functional improvements with hNSC-
EV treatment in the aged brain will involve modulation of activated microglia with inhibition of NLRP3
inflammasomes, AMPK activation, improved mitochondrial function, mTOR inhibition, enhanced autophagy,
improved neurogenesis, and reduced synapse loss. Using a mouse model of aging, this project will first
investigate the effectiveness of EVs administered in the early or late middle age to prevent cognitive and
memory dysfunction in old age (Specific Aim 1). In Specific Aim 2, the effect of EVs administered in old age
for reversing cognitive and memory dysfunction will be measured. Then, to understand the role of microglial
modulation in hNSC-EV-mediated improved cognitive function, the effects of microglia depletion at the time of
EV administration will be examined in both middle-aged and aged mice (Specific Aim 3). Since microglia
depletion in the aged mice improves cognitive function, any additive effects of hNSC-EV treatment over the
effects of microglia depletion would suggest that hNSC-EVs also act on other neural cell types or pathways to
mediate therapeutic benefits. Two regions of the brain, the hippocampus, and the medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC), will be analyzed in male and female aged mice. The proposed studies are highly relevant for
preventing and treating age-related cognitive and memory impairments in old age."

To maximize their growth and metastatic potential, solid tumors promote the formation of new nerve fibers in the tumor
microenvironment (TME). In patients with oral, prostate, breast, gastric, pancreatic, and other cancers, high densities of
nerve fibers in the TME are associated with poor clinical outcomes. We proved that oral cancer cells induce a unique
heterogeneous composition of tumor-associated neurons (TANs) in the TME. The nervous system plays important roles
in homeostasis and inflammatory responses in tissues. However, the regulation of immune cells by nerves remains largely
unclear. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the reciprocal nerve-cancer signals that drive cancer progression to identify
novel targets for therapy and for overcoming immunotherapy resistance. Our preliminary data show that neurons
communicate with immune cells directly through the expression of immunomodulatory molecules and indirectly through
paracrine, adrenergic-dependent cancer cell signaling. The overall hypothesis that we will test in the proposed project is
that TANs induce a maladaptive immune response that supports tumor progression. These newly formed, reprogrammed
TANs regulate the immune response through a multistep mechanism that includes the transformation of quiescent neurons
into sprouting cells that can infiltrate and interact with other cell types, release adrenergic neuroactive molecules, and
support the development of an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Each of these steps may promote tumor
progression and therapy resistance. The proposed research is innovative because it will capitalize on new concepts in
immunology and cancer biology using advanced model systems to yield insights into the mechanisms of tumor
progression and identify new targets for cancer therapy based on neuro-immune crosstalk. This cross-disciplinary
proposal will combine expertise from oncology, immunology, cell biology, neurobiology, cancer genetics, pathology, and
biostatistics in two specific aims across the two labs (Amit and Calin). Aim 1: Determine the mechanisms by which
neuron-dependent cancer cell signaling regulates cytotoxic T-cell function. We will use pharmacological and genetic
approaches combined with advanced spatial imaging techniques (for both protein and RNA) in syngeneic mouse models
to understand how reprogrammed neurons regulate cytotoxic T-cell antitumor activity. Deciphering how TANs exert both
antitumor immune activation and suppression activity through adrenergic signaling and immune checkpoint expression
respectively, will allow us to leverage safe, affordable and well established neuromodulatory approaches to overcome
immunosuppression in cancer. Aim 2: Identify the extracellular vesicle-shuttled driver miRNAs of TAN
reprogramming and their roles in oral cancer progression. Using human-derived sensory neurons and functional
genomic approaches, we will investigate the miRNA-dependent functional plasticity of immunomodulatory genes in TANs.
The completion of the proposed studies will pave the way for treatment strategies that target the neuronal mechanisms
associated with immunosuppression and reverse resistance to immunotherapy. Therapeutic approaches targeting this
critical component of tumor biology are anticipated to improve patients' survival, treatment responses, and quality of life."

out solvation on the surfaces of drug target then utilize these solvation structural and thermodynamic maps to
improve computational methods of binding pocket druggability, virtual screening of purchasable compound

Circadian rhythms arise from genetically encoded clocks that are intimately linked to external cues like light to
synchronize physiology and behavior with the 24-hour solar cycle. Although the genetic networks that give rise
to circadian rhythms are now relatively well established, we still don’t understand many of the fundamental,
molecular steps that determine the ~24-hour basis of these clocks and how they respond to external time-setting
cues. By integrating structural biology and solution biophysical methods with biochemistry and cell biology, we
aim to determine the underlying biochemical principles that lead to the day-long timescale of circadian signaling
and uncover the mechanisms that allow biological clocks to faithfully maintain intrinsic timing and respond
robustly to external cues. With prior NIGMS funding, we studied clock systems from mammals and cyanobacteria
to discover how different clock proteins assemble into regulatory complexes and identified how protein dynamics,
enzyme activity and/or post-translational modifications impact clock timing. Our comparative biochemical
approach highlighted surprising commonalities, such as the competition for mutually exclusive binding sites,
between these clocks despite their different molecular architectures. Here, we will continue to pursue the
structural basis of protein assemblies from diverse biological clocks, determine the consequences of post-
translational modifications on clock protein function, study the molecular basis for entrainment of clocks to
external cues, and seek out new inroads for pharmacological intervention. Funding from the MIRA program
would provide us with the resources and flexibility to explore commonalities in mechanisms of biological
timekeeping across a diverse array of species from cyanobacteria to humans."

Core B will track the nature and consequences of genome modifications carried out in
Projects 1, 3 and 4, and use these data to design improved reagents for CART genome
modification. Core B will analyze several types of genome modification as dictated by
the needs of each project. Integration of lentiviral vectors necessarily disrupts the host
cell locus at the site of integration. We and others have found that insertional
mutagenesis by vectors used to deliver CARs can be associated with altered cell
growth, which has resulted in clinical adverse events, but also clinically favorable clonal
expansions that have bolstered therapeutic effects. The core will use these data to
identify genes and pathways to manipulate to optimize CART expansion and
persistence. Vector integration also marks each transduced cell uniquely, allowing
tracing of the partitioning of descendant cells, information useful in tracking outcomes
and understanding mechanisms of possible adverse events. Cleavage of the host
genome using targeted nucleases is also an effective means of achieving genome
modification; however, off-target cleavage and associated deletions are safety
concerns. The core will monitor off-target cleavage using our iGUIDE technology.
Lastly, in protocols where multiple sgRNA/CAS9 complexes cleave multiple targets in a
single cell, nuclease cleavage at multiple sites can result in rejoining of DNA ends in a
“swapped” fashion, causing chromosomal translocations. Core B will monitor molecular
outcomes in each of these categories to allow optimization of reagents, assessment of
safety, and scoring of cell function."

 Alzheimer's Diseases and Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) impose significant
global challenges that necessitate research to identify critical protective and risk factors of cognitive health.
Research from developing countries shows that the decline in age-specific prevalence and incidence of severe
cognitive impairment and dementia since the 1980s parallels the rise in educational attainment and
improvements in the control of cardiometabolic risk (CMR). However, the complex dynamics of education,
CMR, and cognitive health complicate efforts to pinpoint specific pathways from education or CMR to cognitive
outcomes. The proposed research will use representative longitudinal data from the United States Health and
Retirement Study and its international sister studies in England, China, and Indonesia, as well as new data
obtained from the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol studies to systematically and rigorously
describe and compare the CMR and educational patterns of cognitive function, cognitive aging, and dementia
in four countries. These countries comprise about 25 percent of the world's population, are at different levels of
economic development and stages of nutritional transition, and represent a wide range of historical, cultural,
social, epidemiological, and medical contexts. This research is important because the cross-national
comparison of key patterns of cognitive health will enhance the understanding of how broad social-
environmental contexts, coupled with their embedded individual characteristics and experiences, affect
cognitive health in old age. To accomplish this research goal, the K99 phase will involve training in
neuropsychology, the international context of health and aging, and advanced techniques in comparative
analysis using longitudinal data. This training will take place at the Carolina Population Center (CPC) at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). CPC is an ideal location to receive the training necessary for
the proposed research, given the interdisciplinary nature of the CPC in terms of global studies of health and
wellbeing, and interdisciplinary mentorship, and the access to a wide range of coursework that UNC offers.
Building on the training gleaned during the K99 phase, the goal of the R00 phase will be to (1) examine the
CMR and educational patterns of cognitive aging and dementia by modeling the longitudinal relationships and
using the fixed-effect framework; and (2) contrast these patterns across countries.
 Cognitive aging is a highly complex process that is influenced by factors at the individual and societal
levels. This comparative research will provide a comprehensive picture of cognitive health that cannot be
observed in more homogenous populations, enhance the understanding of ways that broad social-
environmental contexts, coupled with their embedded individual characteristics and experiences, affect
cognitive aging, and, in so doing, provide key insights that can be used to respond to the challenges posed by
AD/ADRD worldwide."
10912063,"The majority of children with cancer (>60%) experience pain and emotional suffering at end of life (EOL) and
their parents experience distress. These children are not enrolled in hospice and have high rates of futile, high-
intensity medical interventions (e.g., ICU admission) at EOL. In contrast, most parents would prefer a home
death for their child. There is strong evidence in adults with cancer that hospice enrollment results in less pain
and emotional suffering, fewer high-intensity medical interventions, and reduced caregiver distress. In adults,
early EOL discussions facilitate longer hospice enrollment which is associated with better ratings of EOL care
and is congruent with patient preferences. Early EOL discussions with parents of children with cancer fosters
hope and emotional support and reduces uncertainty. However, no evidence-based interventions exist that
foster early hospice enrollment or reduce the pain and emotional suffering in children with terminal cancer. The
long-term goal is to identify effective interventions to improve child QOL at EOL and lessen parents’ distress.
The overall objective of this application is to evaluate the efficacy of COMPLETE (Communication Plan: Early
through End of Life), a series of tailored discussions delivered by the child’s primary MD/RN dyad, that begin at
diagnosis, and integrates visual aids, to empathically facilitate conversations with parents about prognosis,
hopes, and goals-of-care across the cancer continuum. The central hypothesis is that COMPLETE will foster
alignment of goals of care between providers and parents when cure is unrealistic, leading to earlier hospice
enrollment, reduced use of high-intensity medical interventions, and less pain and emotional suffering in
children at EOL and less distress in parents. The hypotheses are based on the applicants’ pilot studies
(NIHR21; NR011071-02): COMPLETE resulted in increased hospice enrollment (83% enrolled > 30 days vs
40% nationally), and lower use of high-intensity medical interventions (17% vs 60% nationally). Compared to
baseline, children had significantly less pain and emotional suffering, and parents had significantly lower
distress and uncertainty and more hope. The project rationale is that, if COMPLETE is efficacious, it can be
rapidly translated into clinical practice to support earlier hospice enrollment and improve outcomes of children
with cancer and their parents at EOL. In this multisite cluster-randomized controlled trial of children with cancer
prognosis of < 25% survival and their parents, we aim to determine the efficacy of COMPLETE vs. Attention
control to: 1. Foster earlier hospice enrollment (Primary Aim); 2. Decrease high- intensity medical interventions,
decrease pain and emotional suffering in children at EOL; and, 3. Reduce parental distress and uncertainty
and improve hope. The study innovations include using the oncology MD/RN team to engage parents from
diagnosis and ongoing conversations using visual aids to help establish realistic goals of care that promote
earlier hospice enrollment at EOL. The study significance is that it is expected to yield the evidence MD/RN
teams need to promote better outcomes for children and parents at EOL."

 Weight gain with Dolutegravir (DTG), an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), has been observed
in People living with HIV (PLHIV) including postpartum women. How DTG-based ART regimens affect
postpartum weight is not known. Understanding the impact of maternal DTG-regimens on the physiology of
postpartum body weight regulation has clinical significance as postpartum weight retention is known to increase
future maternal risk of overweight, obesity and non-communicable diseases (NCD). DTG-based ART is being
rolled as the first line regimen in Sub-Saharan Africa for HIV management. Therefore, it is imperative to better
understand how DTG regimens affect the physiology of postpartum body weight regulation and appetite, to
identify potential interventions to reduce future overweight and NCD risk in this population. To address this
research gap, we propose to leverage our R01 study (MI-DART), focused on energy intake and energy
expenditure in a cohort of mother-infant dyads with and without HIV, to further study the impact of DTG on
appetite regulation in these postpartum women (Aim 1).
 This maternal–infant cohort will also allow us to define the impact of maternal DTG-ART regimen on
appetite in their HIV exposed uninfected (HEU) infant compared to HIV unexposed uninfected infants (Aim 2),
and how they relate to infant growth and body composition. In addition to the comparison by maternal ART
regimen, our study will help us understand the mechanisms behind one of the most clinically significant
observations in HEU infants: infant growth deficits in HEU infants with mothers on non-DTG regimen compared
to HUU infant; and whether maternal DTG containing ART regimens have a similar impact.
 We will use targeted approaches to assess appetite regulation, including subjective appetite
questionnaires and pre- and post-prandial levels of objective panels of appetite-stimulating and appetite-reducing
peptides and hormones, along with short-chain fatty acids that regulate levels of these hormones. Unbiased
approaches include assessment of the microbiome as it regulates these hormones and short-chain fatty acids
involved in appetite. We will pair these measures with secondary objective assessments of physical activity along
with energy intake and total energy expenditure data obtained from the parent study to better understand the
impact of appetite, energy intake and energy expenditure.
 Through these two aims, we address an urgent need to understand how maternal DTG impacts the
physiology of body weight regulation and appetite in postpartum women and their HEU infants. These maternal-
infant populations have a unique physiological profile with increased energy demands on the lactating mother
and breastfeeding infant to sustain growth. Our detailed metabolic assessments will further help identify potential
therapeutics (e.g. related to intake/appetite, expenditure, or metabolic pathways) for management of postpartum
weight and infant growth in maternal-infant populations with HIV."
10839022,"PROPOSAL SUMMARY / ABSTRACT:
HIV is a retrovirus that achieves infection through integration of its viral DNA into the host genome of non-
dividing cells. To execute this function, HIV must ensure the nuclear import of its reverse-transcribed genetic
material, which is protected inside of a proteinaceous fullerene cone known as the capsid. As the dimensions
of the capsid are larger than the conventionally accepted width of the nuclear-pore-complex (NPC), it was long
thought that disassembly of the capsid in the host cytoplasm was essential for HIV’s genomic material to gain
access to the nucleus. Recent work has demonstrated that the central channel of the NPC is highly dynamic
and able to accommodate an intact HIV capsid; subsequently several groups have directly observed
assembled capsids within the nuclear compartment. Work from the last decade suggests that the cellular
protein CPSF6 (Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor 6) governs the nuclear import of viral
genomic material through interactions with the HIV capsid. The work outlined in this proposal, broken into
three independent aims, seeks to provide biochemical and structural understanding of this interaction. In AIM1,
I will use real-time binding techniques to provide insight into the biophysical principles of the CPSF6-capsid
interactions. I hypothesize that CPSF6 has a previously unappreciated binding site at the tri-hexamer interface
of the HIV capsid. In AIM2, I will employ our library of capsid assemblies to determine the structure of CPSF6
bound to the capsid protein and confirm these structural features with functional assays. Finally, in AIM3, I will
employ a DNA origami mimic of the NPC in an in vitro reconstitution dissect CPSF6’s contribution to nuclear
import of the HIV capsid. I hypothesize that CPSF6 can compete with Nup153 and thereby release the capsid
from the nuclear basket."

The DECREASE SSI Trial (Decolonization to Reduce After-Surgery Events of Surgical Site Infection)
 Colon and small bowel surgery are high-volume, high-cost surgeries performed in over 675,000
patients in the United States each year. These surgeries carry one of the highest surgical site infection (SSI)
rates, with estimates of 11-45%, or 2- to 3-fold higher than nationally reported rates, when comprehensive
surveillance efforts are used, such as in clinical trials. Comprehensive tracking also uncovers a
disproportionate amount of post-discharge incisional SSIs. These incisional SSIs are strongly tied to patient
anxiety, stress, embarrassment, dissatisfaction, and lower quality of life scores.
 Mounting evidence shows that social and economic disadvantage can adversely affect the risk of SSI,
likely due to the differential ability to protect a fresh incision from infection after hospital discharge. The
Decolonization to Reduce After-Surgery Events of Surgical Site Infection (DECREASE SSI) Trial will test the
value of adding a post-operative intervention to current pre-operative and intra-operative prevention practices.
The DECREASE SSI Trial is a multi-site pragmatic randomized controlled clinical trial comparing routine post-
discharge wound care to a post-discharge decolonization regimen of chlorhexidine bathing and nasal iodophor
to prevent SSI events in the 30 days following discharge for open colon and small bowel surgery. If successful,
this trial will provide a simple prevention measure for the 675,000 persons who undergo non-laparoscopic
surgery involving the small and large intestines each year."
10850916,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sepsis, commonly caused by bloodstream infections (BSI), is a rapidly progressive and life-threatening disease.
Unfortunately, prolonged delay in microbiological diagnosis increases patient mortality, promotes the misuse of
antibiotics, and consequently, the evolution of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Herein, we aim to deliver an
amplification-free, microfluidic system for pathogen detection, identification (ID), and antimicrobial susceptibility
testing (AST) directly from whole blood. To achieve our goal, we propose a platform based on microfluidic-
assisted microscopy to sort, trap, detect, and monitor pathogens at single cell resolution. For pathogen ID, we
will adopt a multispectral barcoding scheme to differentially label molecular probes for direct multiplex ribosomal
RNA (rRNA) detection to classify and speciate pathogens, along with a nanotube assisted microwave
electroporation (NAME) technique to efficiently deliver the probes intracellularly for amplification-free single
microbe detection. Positive pathogen ID will guide quantitative multimodal phenotypic AST (mPhAST), in which
we will monitor early changes in microbial growth kinetics with cytological measures of viability in response to
relevant antibiotic conditions at the single cell level to determine susceptibility/resistance with improved speed
and reliability. Combined with upstream whole blood pre-processing for pathogen isolation and concentration
followed by ID then AST, we aim to deliver sample to answer within 90 min for BSI triage and as early as 30
minutes more for antibiotic minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination. We have assembled a superb
team of multi-disciplinary investigators and industry-leading advisors with complementary expertise and a strong
track record of collaboration. We propose the following aims: 1) to develop a rapid BSI triage protocol for broad
pathogen detection, classification, and ID; 2) to develop a quantitative mPhAST; 3) to develop an integrated ID-
mPhAST platform; 4) to perform analytical and clinical validation of our ID-mPhAST platform. Our short-term
goal is to obtain the necessary preliminary data to plan for product development and commercialization, with the
long-term goal of translating our diagnostic platform to reduce sepsis-related morbidity and mortality."
10850917,"Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Loss of vision in glaucoma is caused by the
selective death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Rapid retraction of RGC dendrites with synapse disintegration,
identified as an early pathological change after glaucomatous injury, leads to neuronal dysfunction and death.
Many studies have focused on axonal regeneration, yet little is known about the ability of RGCs to regenerate
dendrites. We recently demonstrated that insulin administered after substantial dendritic arbor shrinkage
promoted robust RGC dendrite regeneration after optic nerve axotomy and in a mouse glaucoma model.
However, several key questions remain unanswered: 1) does insulin regenerate synapses and restore
neuronal function after glaucomatous damage? 2) Is impaired insulin signaling a trigger for dendritic pathology
in glaucoma? 3) What are the mechanisms driving insulin-mediated dendrite regeneration? 4) What is the
translational potential of insulin for RGC repair? In this application, we propose studies that will fill this
knowledge gap and test the overarching hypothesis that insulin signaling is crucial for dendrite regeneration
and functional restoration in glaucoma. We will use established models of glaucoma in mice and non-human
primates as well as gain- and loss-of-function paradigms and innovative approaches in three independent, yet
complementary, specific aims. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that insulin regenerates dendrites and
synapses leading to sustained restoration of neuronal function. These studies will also determine whether
different RGC subtypes have the ability to mount a strong regenerative response and reestablish appropriate
synaptic connectivity. Experiments outlined in Aim 2, will test the hypotheses that: i) impaired insulin signaling
impinging on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) mediates early dendritic pathology and synapse
elimination, and ii) insulin-mediated dendrite regeneration involves downstream bona fide effectors of protein
translation and cytoskeletal regulation. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that insulin treatment, including
gene therapy, will effectively promote long-term RGC dendrite regeneration and restore visual function in non-
human primate glaucoma. We will capitalize on our ability to use longitudinal in vivo imaging and
electrophysiological techniques to monitor disease onset, progression, and recovery. The outcome of this
application will have a major impact on our understanding of novel mechanisms and targets that promote RGC
dendritic and synaptic regeneration as well as restoration of visual function. Importantly, this project will
generate rigorous and compelling pre-clinical data that will serve as a knowledge-translation springboard
towards the clinical development of insulin as a therapeutic strategy for glaucoma."
10852002,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the major health problem in the US that imposes significant physical, financial, and
emotional tolls. Thus, there is a strong and urgent need for an effective and widely applicable therapy.
Excessive accumulation of lipids in beta cells is considered to contribute to the development of T2D. At the
same time, lipids supports insulin secretion. We aim to understand how an intracellular organelle termed lipid
droplets (LDs) in beta cells regulate a double-edged sword action of lipids. Our work to date has shown that
lipid droplet protein perilipin 2 and 5 (PLIN2 and 5) each has a unique role in beta cells to support insulin
secretion and protects beta cells from nutritional stress. PLIN5 interacts with adipose triglycerides lipase
(ATGL) and supports insulin secretion. PLIN2 sequestrates lipids as an inert pool and protects beta cells from
lipid overload. However, beta cells cannot continue to accumulate lipids indefinitely. Thus, a pathway of LD
clearance is important to maintain beta cell health under nutritional stress. Lipophagy is self-digestion of LDs at
lysosome and known to play a role in LD clearance in a wide range of cells. Importantly, dysregulation of
lipophagy has been associated with obese adipocytes and fatty liver. However, little is known regarding a role
of lipophagy in beta cells. Our preliminary data showed that lipophagy is constitutively active in beta cells
without nutrient deprivation. Interestingly, chronic suppression of LIPA in INS1 cells, rat islets, and human non-
diabetic islets impairs insulin secretion. Therefore, we hypothesize that lysosomal degradation of LDs is critical
for LD homeostasis and insulin secretion in beta cells, and that the impairment in lipophagy accelerates beta
cell demise in T2D. The following three aims will test our hypothesis.
Specific Aim 1: Determine how LIPA regulates LD catabolism and lipid metabolism in beta cells under
regular and glucolipotoxic conditions: Our preliminary data indicates that LIPA and ATGL each has a
distinct role in mobilization of LDs in beta cells. We will clarify how LIPA and ATGL confer the spatial and
temporal regulation of lipid metabolism at LDs using beta cells in which LIPA and ATGL are down-regulated.
Specific Aim 2: Determine a role of LIPA in the maintenance of beta cell function and health: Our
preliminary data indicates that prolonged suppression of lipophagy negatively affects insulin secretion. We will
address how LIPA deficiency affect beta cell health and function at regular and glucolipotoxic conditions.
Specific Aim 3: Determine whether lipophagy dysfunction contributes to beta cell failure in T2D. It has
been proposed that lysosome becomes dysfunctional in beta cells during the development of T2D. This could
create functional deficiency of LIPA that requires the acidity of lysosome. In addition, nutritional stress may
increase demand for clearance of LDs by lipophagy during the development of T2D. Here, we will test the
relationship between nutritional stress and lipophagy in beta cells using in vitro and in vivo models. We will
learn whether impaired lipophagy contributes to beta cell demise in T2D."
10852005,"Project Summary
Despite the establishment of obesity as a risk factor in the development of a multitude of cancer types including
breast cancer, there is still a significant insufficiency of genetic evidence for implicating obesity in the initiation
and progression of breast cancer development. While immunotherapeutic approaches such as the PD-1/PD-L1
blockade have shown promise in treating breast cancer, obesity causes substantial impairment of anti-tumor
immunity. A significant challenge in the development of effective immunotherapeutic strategies for obesity-
associated breast cancer lies in the characterization of the bone fide target genes that drive obesity-associated
immune resistance. The emergence of noncoding RNAs as important biological molecules has provided the
foundation for the development of next-generation treatment strategies. Our preliminary data demonstrated that
a small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), SNORD46, is upregulated in breast cancer and negatively correlated with the
infiltration of cytotoxic leukocytes. We also indicated that obesity is associated with a chromatin variant of
SNORD46. We collected genetic evidence indicating that the expression of SNORD46 leads to obesity and
mammary gland tumors which are resistant to immunotherapy. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to
comprehensively characterize and implicate SNORD46 as a driver of obesity-associated breast cancer and
demonstrate that targeting snoRNAs effectively improves the expansion and activation of CD8+ T-cells and NK
cells and sensitizes obesity-associate breast cancer in immunotherapy.
We will address our central hypothesis that snoRNAs act as essential gene targets that promote obesity and
obesity-associated breast cancer initiation and immune resistance, which could be attenuated in vivo by an anti-
sense oligonucleotide-based targeted therapy. In Specific Aim 1, we will define the molecular mechanism of
SNORD46 inhibited, IL-15-dependent non-classic pathway in adipocytes, and IL-15-dependent expression of
stimulatory checkpoints in CD8+ T cell and NK cells. In Specific Aim 2, we will ascertain the functional importance
of snoRNAs in obesity-associated tumorigenesis and immune resistance using high-fat diet-induced obese mice
and Snord46 mut/mut knockin obese mice.
The proposed study will provide initial genetic evidence for defining the crucial role of adipocyte-expressed
snoRNAs in promoting obesity and obesity-associated breast cancer. Mechanistically, we will elucidate the
molecular mechanisms of the SNORD46-leukocyte interactions that drive obesity-associated breast cancer
resistance to immunotherapy. Clinically, the proposed studies will delineate that targeting snoRNAs using locked
nucleic acids (LNAs) effectively improves the proliferation/activation of CD8+ T-cells and NK cells in vivo,
sensitizing obesity-associated breast cancer to immune checkpoint blockers."

This competing continuation application seeks an additional five years of support for a pre-doctoral
interdisciplinary training program in research on alcohol and alcohol use disorders. The training program, led
by co-directors Drs. Fillmore and Prendergast, is based in the Psychology Department at the University of
Kentucky but includes preceptors from five departments and two colleges across the UK campus. The program
provides graduate students with interdisciplinary training to effectively investigate and discover the intricacies
and complexities of alcohol use disorders, at all levels of investigation from the cellular and neurophysiological
systems to the roles of personality, social and environmental factors. The need for a translational and
interdisciplinary program in the investigation of alcohol use disorders is great as advancements and
discoveries continue to be made across multiple levels of investigation. This core expertise among our training

10848935,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Superwarfarins are 4-hydroxycoumarin derivatives that are well known to interfere with blood coagulation,
specifically through inhibition of vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1), an enzyme that plays a critical role in
the recycling of vitamin K. This process is required for multiple biological systems, particularly the synthesis of
clotting factors in the liver. These toxic agents were developed in the 1970s for pest control due to increasing
warfarin resistance among rodents. They are efficacious rodenticides due to long elimination half-lives of up to
two months, but this also has led to both accidental and intentional poisonings, resulting in severe hemorrhage
and/or death. They have also been more recently discovered as contaminants of cannabinoids, leading to
clusters of hospitalizations and mortality. The only oral antidote is vitamin K, but treatment of even relatively
minor warfarin overdoses can take 24-48 hours for a substantial reduction in the risk of bleeding. Given the long
elimination half-lives of superwarfarins, weeks to months of expensive therapy is required for those agents. Major
bleeding can be urgently controlled through infusion of plasma clotting factors if they are available at the time
and place of exposure but would be scarce in mass casualty events. These also have limited shelf lives and
storage conditions and require intravenous infusion. This project will leverage highly innovative technologies,
including small molecule analysis in the zebrafish model, which has been previously shown to have a high degree
of conservation of the coagulation cascade. In preliminary studies, the research team has found that 4-
hydroxycoumarin derivatives such as brodifacoum, bromadiolone, and difenacoum, cause a profound
coagulopathy in zebrafish, which is easily and rapidly visualized in transparent embryos and larvae using
vascular endothelial injury. The proposed studies will evaluate a drug repurposing library in this model to identify
FDA-approved molecules as novel medical countermeasures for superwarfarin toxicity. This will result in the
potential rapid development of hit compounds that could expedite application to and treatment of large numbers
of affected patients."
10852838,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The clinical use of potent anti-androgens has promoted the emergence of novel forms of castration-
resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), including neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), which is highly aggressive
and lethal. To date, relatively little is known about the regulatory programs for specification of rare
neuroendocrine cells in the normal prostate, or how they might be recapitulated or altered during neuroendocrine
differentiation in prostate cancer. Therefore, we will pursue a comparative analysis of neuroendocrine
specification in the normal and transformed prostate to elucidate similarities and differences in their regulatory
programs. In preliminary studies of prostate organogenesis, our findings suggest that prostate neuroendocrine
cells are generated at pre-pubertal stages of organogenesis, when androgen levels are low, and that the
transcription factor Ascl1 is essential for formation of prostate neuroendocrine cells. To complement these
analyses, we have also performed studies of neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate tumors through single-
cell RNA-sequencing of mouse CRPC tumors and organoid models to identify candidate non-cell autonomous
interactions that may regulate neuroendocrine differentiation, as well as computational analyses to identify novel
candidate master regulators of neuroendocrine differentiation in tumors. Importantly, we have obtained evidence
for a non-cell autonomous role for extrinsic signals from the microenvironment in promoting neuroendocrine
differentiation of prostate tumor cells.
 Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that neuroendocrine differentiation in both normal and
tumor contexts is governed by extrinsic signals from the environment in response to low AR activity in order to
regulate intrinsic pathways of neuroendocrine specification. To investigate this hypothesis, we will pursue an
innovative combination of in vivo, ex vivo, molecular, and computational analyses that are organized in three
synergistic specific aims: (1) Investigation of Ascl1 in prostate development and cancer to pursue comparative
analyses of its role in normal and tumor contexts; (2) Investigation of intrinsic regulators of neuroendocrine
differentiation in prostate cancer using computational systems approaches to identify candidate master
regulators followed by their functional validation; and (3) Analysis of stromal signals that promote neuroendocrine
differentiation in response to androgen deprivation to evaluate the role of candidate signaling factors from the
microenvironment in modulating neuroendocrine differentiation in response to AR in organogenesis and prostate
cancer. These studies will have strong translational impact through the identification of molecular targets that
are specific for neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Furthermore, this project will be highly integrated with the other
components of this program project through collaborative interactions with the Sawyers lab in analyzing
microenvironmental signals, with the Abate-Shen lab in studies of mouse models, with Core A in analysis of
human tissue samples, and Core B for statistical support and data management,"

10852871,"Skeletal metastases associated with advanced prostate cancer (PCa) continue to kill more than 29,000 men per
year in the United States. Metastatic disease remains incurable because a population of cancer cells within a
tumor are resistant to all known natural and synthetic compounds. Resistance to a therapy may be solely cell
intrinsic, therefore present in a treatment-naïve setting, as well as be induced through external selective pressure
via therapeutic treatment. How and when drug resistance arises has profound implications to understand
tumorigenesis as well as to guide treatment and management of disease. Our preliminary data and other recent
studies have demonstrated that the appearance of a subset of morphologically distinct cancer cells, polyploid
giant cancer cells (PGCCs), is associated with therapeutic intervention, including taxane-based chemotherapy
in castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPCa). Consistent with other studies, we further show that PGCCs are
often multinucleated, have elevated genomic content, can be found in biopsies of metastatic tumor tissue, and
are reported to possess senescent as well as stem-like properties. PGCCs also have a highly motile
mesenchymal phenotype and are enriched in metastases, suggesting that, in addition to their role in therapeutic
resistance, they may be important initiators of metastatic spread. While multiple mechanisms of drug and stress
resistance have been described, the totality of our preliminary data leads us to hypothesize that PGCCs survive
the intrinsic (microenvironment and metastasis) and extrinsic (therapeutic) stresses associated with cancer
progression in a novel manner by existing in a reversible G0 state. In Specific Aim 1 we will determine how
and when PGCCs are formed. Further, we will measure PGCCs in mouse and human PCa tissues across
clinical disease states. In Specific Aim 2 we will demonstrate that reversible senescence underlies a
common mechanism of stress resistance in PGCCs. We will also assess if PGCCs exhibit cancer stem cell
properties that permit them to reinitate proliferation. In Specific Aim 3 we will demonstrate that PGCCs are
important initiators of metastasis. In addition, we will measure circulating PGCCs in murine models and
patients in different clinical disease states. The results of our studies will fundamentally change our
understanding of how tumors develop resistance to stress as well as evolve the ability to metastasize."
10853067,"C-DIAS RESEARCH CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Improved access to evidence-based pharmacological and psychosocial treatments is urgently needed for
persons with substance use disorders. Inequity in access to proven treatments is amplified in low-resourced
communities and with organizations serving marginalized and underrepresented populations. The lack of rigor
and consistency in methods, measures, design and approach undermines efforts to systematically learn how to
implement evidence-based interventions across diverse settings. There is an enormous need for greater
precision in how to implement and sustain proven interventions for addiction. Interventions and their delivery
platforms are the “what” of an implementation endeavor, whereas implementation strategies are the “how”
these interventions are installed and/or maintained. Only 2.4% of NIDA-funded research has examined the
“how” of implementation strategies, and among these few, wide methodological variation exists. The Center for
Dissemination & Implementation At Stanford (C-DIAS) Research Core integrates three teams of experts, led by
top research scientists. The teams align with three domains necessary to advance implementation research in
addiction: Methods & Measures, Design & Modeling, and Policy & Financing. Three complementary and
innovative C-DIAS Research Projects will serve as open laboratories for Research Core activities. The Core
will interact bi-directionally with the Research Projects, positioning each to accumulate and disseminate
technical knowledge for the field. These synergistic efforts create an unprecedented opportunity for a deeper
and accelerated examination of the mechanisms underlying how implementation strategies work, their
contextual determinants, and how to select and deliver them to optimize implementation and clinical outcomes.
The three Research Core teams, along with the Research Projects, will translate options about how to
implement and at what cost for real-world decision-makers. The Research Core will: PREPARE the addiction
research and practice communities with pragmatic and standardized methods and measures of implementation
strategies for real-world implementation endeavors (Aim 1); IMPLEMENT rigorous examinations of the
components and mechanisms of implementation strategies for effectiveness and cost, using innovative
designs and modeling techniques, and creating decision-support tools for policymakers and systems leaders
(Aim 2); and, SUSTAIN and scale-up evidence-based addiction treatments by identifying barriers, needed
policy and financing strategies, and emerging solutions for ensuring their long-term, high quality and equitable
delivery in community settings and health systems (Aim 3). Research Core activities directly address NIDA
priorities to “better understand the barriers to successful and sustainable implementation of evidence-based
practices and to develop implementation strategies that effectively overcome these barriers.” Not incremental,
but instead paradigm shifting, the C-DIAS Research Core will add to the best of existing methodologies, and
advance generalizable and practical innovations to improve equitable access to proven addiction treatments."
10852873,"Abstract: Abscisic Acid Regulates Dormancy of Disseminated Tumor Cells in Bone Marrow
Prostate cancer (PCa) preferentially metastasizes to the bone marrow. Paget's “seed and soil hypothesis” in
1889 has been used to describe tumor cells (i.e. seed) metastasize to bone marrow (i.e. soil), which have
specific factors conducive to metastatic growth. Recently, abscisic acid (ABA), a phytohormone, regulates the
dormancy of plant seeds and other stress responses was demonstrated to be expressed in mammals where it
inhibits proliferation of many cell types. Our data shows that ABA induces PCa cell cycle arrest in G0, regulates
PCa survival in response to chemotherapy, and ABA receptors (LANCL2, PPAR) are expressed by DTCs
recovered from human marrow. Further ABA expression may represent a common pathway for dormancy
mediators (e.g. TGFß, GAS6, BMP4). The central hypothesis is:
Abscisic acid induces dormancy of metastatic DTCs in the bone marrow.
Aim 1: Determine the extent to which ABA induces PCa dormancy in bone marrow. Subhypothesis:
ABA is critical for establishing DTC dormancy. Approach: Coculture studies and in vivo metastasis model s
will explore the role of ABA in establishing DTC dormancy and how regulates cancer stem cell (CSC)-like
activities. In vivo studies will be examine the role that niche-produced ABA plays in the maintenance of DTC
dormancy. We will validate these observations with DTCs isolated from marrow of PCa patients.
Aim 2: Determine the extent to which ABA signaling through LANCL2 or PPAR receptors induces
dormancy of PCa cells in the marrow. Subhypothesis: The binding of ABA to its receptors are critical for
DTCs to become dormant. Approach: In Aim 2A: we will defined the role that each ABA receptor plays in
regulating dormancy and what are the downstream signals, and in Aim 2B, we will determine what transcription
pathways are activated by ABA to induce DTC
Aim 3: Define the role of ABA signaling in resistance of PCa to chemotherapy in bone marrow.
Subhypothesis: Dormant PCa cells are resistant to chemotherapy. Approach: We will to evaluate whether the
disruption of DTC dormancy by ABA or ABA signaling will improve treatment outcomes by sensitizing
dormant PCa cells to current chemotherapies."
10852827,"Abstract: T Cell Responses to Hybrid Insulin Peptides as Biomarkers of Disease Activity in
Type 1 Diabetes
An important objective in T1D research is the investigation of autoantigens that activate effector T cells
and trigger the inflammatory process in islet beta-cells. We recently identified Hybrid Insulin Peptides
(HIPs) as a new class of autoantigens in type 1 diabetes (T1D). These neoantigens are created by the
fusion of insulin fragments with peptides from other secretory granule proteins such as chromogranin
A (ChgA), islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), neuropeptide Y (NPY) or insulin itself. Because insulin is
present only in pancreatic beta cells, this discovery might provide an explanation for organ-specific
autoimmunity in T1D. Importantly, CD4 T cells responding to HIPs have been isolated from the islets
of deceased T1D patients, demonstrating the relevance of these autoantigens to the human disease.
We hypothesize that T cells reactive to HIPs can serve as biomarkers of disease. Our goals in this
project are (1) to characterize T cell responses to HIPs in the PBMCs of T1D and controls; (2) to
determine the extent of reactivity to insulin B:9-23 Hybrid Insulin Peptides in recent onset T1D patients;
(3) Investigate the presence and phenotype of HIP-reactive T cells in the natural history of T1D."

durability, but further emphasized the need for improved toxicity management, with CRS and NTX rates of 96%
and 76%, with grade ≥ 3 events in 17% and 38%, respectively4. The future success and application of CAR T
cells to a broader population of patients is limited by the incidence and severity of these toxicities.
 Anakinra, a human interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R) antagonist, has demonstrated clinical efficacy in the
treatment of rheumatoid and sepsis related macrophage activation syndrome, as well as in recent mouse models
of CRS and NTX9-11. These data suggest that IL-1R blockade may play a critical role in the pathophysiology of
both CRS and NTX, but does not appear to be required for CAR-T cell efficacy. Furthermore, signaling through
IL-1R potentiates IL-6 production, and blockade of IL-1R therefore has the potential to block IL-6 production and
its downstream consequences. We are opening a Phase 2 single center, open-label study evaluating the safety
and efficacy of anakinra when combined with axicabtagene ciloleucel in subjects with relapsed or refractory NHL.
Our hypothesis is that blocking IL-1R signaling will prevent the development of grade 2 or higher NTX and CRS,
and that this will be evident clinically and by correlative evidence of modulation of cytokines and immune cell
interactions in the peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Dr. Maus (PI) will be holding the IND, Dr.
Frigault (co-I) will be the clinical investigator, and Kite Pharma will provide the drugs (axi-cel and anakinra) as
well as partial financial support for the clinical study. We seek NIH funding (this R01 proposal) for salary support
for the investigators of the clinical study and to conduct the correlative studies, including abstracting clinical data
on CRS and NTX using two different grading systems, conducting laboratory measurements of cytokine levels,
and detailed phenotyping and functional mapping of both the T cell and myeloid cell compartments at the protein
and single-cell transcriptome level in the blood and cerebral spinal fluid that will enable probing the mechanisms
of immune interactions in the presence or absence of ankinra. We will use samples from patients treated with
commercial axicabtagene ciloleucel as comparators. Completion of this study is significant because it could
enable routine outpatient use of CAR T cell therapy, and we will use innovative methods to define the
mechanisms and networks of immune cell interactions that drive CRS and neurotoxicity."

The proposed project aims to increase our knowledge regarding the intersection of pharmacogenomics,
contraceptive efficacy, and health disparities. U.S. women of color are at much greater risk of experiencing
contraceptive failure, resulting in more unintended pregnancies than their white peers. While social
determinants of health, such as racial discrimination and access to healthcare, contribute meaningfully to
contraceptive availability and use, inherent pharmacogenomic differences could also account for significant
individual-to-individual disparities in efficacy. The most effective oral emergency contraceptive (EC) method,
ulipristal acetate (UPA), which works by blocking progesterone action in the preovulatory follicle, appears to be
less effective in certain populations even when optimally dosed. We have demonstrated that UPA is converted
to inactive metabolites by the enzyme cytochrome P450 3A5 (CYP3A5). Moreover, we established that the
primate ovarian follicle, the site of UPA action as an EC, expresses remarkably high levels of CYP3A5 through
the periovulatory interval and luteal development. The genotype and phenotype frequency of an active variant
of CYP3A5 is significantly greater in those identifying as Black as compared to whites, with the latter
possessing primarily a nonfunctional variant. Because active CYP3A5 is a major contributor to drug
metabolism, we hypothesize that UPA is significantly less effective at preventing ovulation in women with the
active CYP3A5 variant. In this proposal, we will determine if follicular CYP3A5 reduces intraovarian UPA levels
relative to what is observed systemically (Aim 1) using the clinically relevant rhesus macaque model. Studies
will also be performed to determine if blocking CYP3A5 activity leads to greater UPA efficacy in inhibiting
processes essential for ovulation. In complementary human subjects studies, we plan to assess if CYP3A5
genotype (active versus inactive form) determines UPA efficacy (Aim 2). Women recruited for this study will be
genotyped and categorized as possessing active or inactive CYP3A5 alleles and then assessed for UPA
pharmacodynamics. We will also explore other genetic variants that might play a role in drug metabolism. The
primary endpoint includes determining if significant differences exist in the rate at which UPA fails to prevent
ovulation and the pharmacokinetics of UPA metabolism related to the CYP3A5 genotype. The results of the
studies will determine if a genetic predisposition exists for racial disparities in contraceptive efficacy and the
risk for unintended pregnancy. The broad, long-term goal of this research includes providing a means to
maximize the therapeutic potential of UPA in women through testing to identify individuals at risk for failure
and/or developing approaches to limit drug metabolism."
10853096,"ABSTRACT
In conventional T cells, signaling pathways that control cellular metabolism have a crucial role in dictating the
outcome of T cell activation and their effector function. Resting CD4 and CD8 T cells use predominantly
oxidative metabolism but stimulation leads them to sharply increase glucose metabolism and adopt aerobic
glycolysis as a primary metabolic program. However, little is known about metabolic regulation and its role for
cellular functions of Natural Killer T (NKT) cells although recent studies indicate an important role of
metabolism in NKT cell differentiation. NKT cells are a heterogeneous population that shows a high degree of
phenotypic and functional specialization. When activated, unlike conventional T cells, NKT cells exhibit a fast
and robust effector function such as cytokine release or cytotoxicity. NKT cells can exert either an inflammatory
or a regulatory function depending on the tissue type such as liver or adipose tissue, respectively, that are a
site of metainflammation. Thus, the metabolic regulation in NKT cells likely plays an important role in immune
diseases. To understand how NKT cells regulate their metabolism to mediate an appropriate immune response
under a different environment, we measured parameters that associate with the metabolic capacity and
compared them with that of CD4 T cells. Our study revealed that NKT cells are very different from CD4 T cells
in many ways. NKT cells rely more on oxidative phosphorylation for their survival and repurposed Glc carbon is
used for optimal cytokine expression. In addition, NKT cells rely on glutamine (Gln) metabolism for proliferation
but not to express IFN-. Gln starved NKT cells seem to be inefficient to switch to glucose (Glc) metabolism,
which is similar to Gln-addicted cancer cells. Metabolomic data revealed that NKT cells have elevated
glutamine metabolites prior to stimulation further supporting an essential role of Gln metabolism. mTORC and
AMPK is known to increase and decrease Gln metabolism, respectively. In line with this, NKT cells are
sensitive to mTORC inhibition but AMPK deficiency results in hyperproliferation and increased cytokine
expression. Based on our data, we hypothesize that the proper regulation of Gln metabolism is critical for NKT
cells’ survival and function, which is controlled by the balance between mTORC and AMPK activity. To test the
hypothesis, we propose two specific aims. Aim 1 will investigate the mechanisms by which Gln controls NKT
cell proliferation and function, and Aim 2 will focus on the mTORC-AMPK axis to discern the regulation of Gln
metabolism in NKT cells. Metabolic status and regulation in NKT cells is virtually unexplored and, therefore,
investigating the regulation of the metabolic networks in NKT cells is highly innovative. Undoubtedly, the
proposed studies are significant given the fact that these studies will address a poorly understood area, and
the results will establish specific and selective metabolic demands of NKT cells."

Emergence of the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant and return to in-person learning
is rapidly increasing the COVID-19 disease incidence and transmission rate in children. Therefore, it is critical
to protect younger children. Toward this goal, ongoing COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials aim to reach those as
young as 6 months old. Because pediatric trials involve fewer participants and children have a lower rate of
symptomatic infection, pediatric vaccine efficacy will be initially based on in vitro immunological parameters—
virus neutralization and antibodies to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) or S1 fragment of the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein. However, whether these same metrics reflect an effective vaccine response in a developing
immune system (<5 years old) remains to be determined. Immune responses to vaccines are influenced by
age-associated physiological changes, particularly in the first 5 years of life when changes occur in B and T
cell differentiation and effector functions, affinity maturation of B cell responses, and myeloid subpopulations
and their cytokine production. Additionally, in very young children mucosal IgA rapidly reach adult levels, while
serum IgA only reaches adult levels in adolescence. This difference may account for the disparate COVID-19
disease incidence, transmission, and severity in children. How evolving changes in pediatric mucosal and
systemic immune ontogeny affect SARS-CoV-2 infection- and mRNA vaccination-elicited immune responses
are incompletely understood. The overall objective here is to define mucosal and systemic SARS-CoV-2
infection- and mRNA vaccine- elicited molecular and immune cellular responses in healthy pediatric maturing
immune systems and in pathological B cell states (inborn or acquired).
In a Pfizer-vaccinated adult cohort, compared to healthy adults, we have found that B cell depleted adult
multiple sclerosis patients exhibited a significantly increased RBD-specific CD8 T cell response, despite
negligible production of anti-RBD IgG. Interestingly, in children homeostatic and induced IgA levels are
minimally affected by B cell depleting therapies. Our central hypothesis is that mRNA vaccination within the
pediatric population augments mucosal (IFN and IgA) and CD8 T cellular immune parameters in the youngest
children (<5yo) relative to older children (>5yo). We predict that such immune profile will i) correlate with
vaccine- and infection-elicited responses, supporting their limited infection pathology (Aim 1); and ii) become
enhanced in those children with B cell deficiencies (Aim 2). To test this hypothesis and its predictions, we will i)
establish a prospective longitudinal cohort of SARS-CoV-2 infected/vaccinated healthy and B cell deficient
children across age groups; and ii) apply transcriptomic, immune phenotypic, and antigen-specific humoral and
cellular studies to compare SARS-CoV-2 vaccine- and infection-elicited molecular and cellular signatures in
healthy children and those with inborn and acquired B cell defects. Resulting insights will define
metrics
of
infection/vaccine immunity, constituting an initial step toward establishing correlates of protection in
immunocompetent/B
deficient
children."

10847546,"CORE C PROJECT SUMMARY
The main goal of the Cell and Analytical Core (Core C) is to facilitate completion of the program investigators’
specific aims. To accomplish this goal, Core C will perform three specific aims, two of which are service
components and one of which is an academic component. Aim 1 - Service component 1 - Cell isolation and
characterization: a) To uniformly isolate primary mouse endothelial cells from wild type and transgenic mice and
from human tissue, using a calibrated system to make cell suspensions from tissue in combination with a
negative (CD45-based) and positive selection (CD31-based) endothelial cell purification method. Wild type or
transgenic mice will be received from animal Core B or from the three projects. b) To characterize the endothelial
character of the isolated EC. c) To expand and distribute purified endothelial cells in early passages to the three
research projects. Aim 2 - Service component 2 - Gene Delivery and deletion: a) To construct, purify and deliver
recombinant adenovirus, lentivirus and adeno-associated virus (AAV). b) To deplete and manipulate
endogenous genes in mouse and human EC, using CRISPR Cas9 and siRNA technology. Aim 3 -Academic
component 1- Analysis: a) To measure cell metabolism. O2 consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular
acidification rate (ECAR) using Seahorse and performing metabolomics. b) To evaluate oxidative and nitrosative
stress. c) To assess inflammation by measuring cytokine/chemokine profiles in cell supernatants using magnetic
bead-based Multiplex analysis and adhesion molecule expression relevant for endothelial-leukocyte interactions
using an in-house developed cell-based ELISA. This technology will also be applied to measure
cytokine/chemokine profile in plasma samples from mice. d) To evaluate endothelial-mesenchymal transition-
related genes in transcriptomics, using bulk and single cell RNASeq. e) To assess endothelial barrier function
by combining measurements of macromolecular permeability to a macromolecular tracer and electrical
impedance of endothelial monolayers. In summary, synergy with the three scientific projects, administrative Core
A and core B will be organized as follows: upon receiving wild type or transgenic mice from animal Core B and
from the three projects, Core C will isolate, characterize, expand and distribute early passages of primary mouse
endothelial cells and of well-characterized in house isolated or purchased human endothelial cells to all four
projects. The Core will moreover construct recombinant adenovirus, lentivirus and adeno-associated virus or use
CRISPR ON and specific siRNA to manipulate gene expression in human and mouse endothelial cells and will
coordinate scRNASeq and proteomics. The Core will moreover organize in a standardized manner cell analysis
for all parameters listed above. Finally, Core C will collaborate with administrative Core A and animal Core B to
coordinate dissemination of data generated through the collaborations between the cores and projects."
10847548,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 2
The goal of Project #2 is to delineate the molecular mechanisms whereby endothelial cell (EC)
bioenergetics and, glycolysis, in particular, regulate vascular redox status and vasorelaxation in
physiological and pathological conditions with a focus on type 1 diabetes (T1D). Endothelial dysfunction
(ED) is a precursor and major contributor to vascular complications which are among the most disabling and life-
threatening complications of T1D. Preventing and managing endothelial function as well as reducing the
occurrence of cardiovascular events remains a challenge in T1D, notably in female patients who lose the
protective effects of female sex and have been poorly studied. Emerging evidence suggests a role for EC
bioenergetics, notably glycolysis, in the control of vascular function. In preliminary data, we show that enhanced
EC glycolysis is a novel cause of ED in T1D and uncover unexpected roles for female sex and endothelial leptin
signaling as regulators of EC metabolism and vascular homeostasis. Our novel data show that ED in T1D
involves increases in EC glycolytic flux, increased 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3
(PFKFB3, a major regulator of glycolysis) expression, and increased expression and activity of the reactive
oxygen species (ROS) producing enzyme, NADPH Oxidase 1 (Nox1), in ECs. Functionally, we demonstrate that
selective inhibition of PFKFB3 or Nox1 restores EC-dependent relaxation in T1D. Conversely, we show that
upregulation of PFKFB3, via ex-vivo adenoviral EC transduction, is alone sufficient to impair EC relaxation in the
aorta via mechanisms that include increased EC Nox1 and ROS production and decreased eNOS-derived nitric
oxide. Remarkably, in healthy mice we observed better EC function in females which was correlated with lower
ECs PFKFB3 levels and reduced ECs glycolytic flux, as compared to males. In T1D-mice, ED is associated with
increased EC glycolysis in both sexes. The upstream regulators of EC metabolism remain poorly understood.
Herein, we have identified a novel role for the adipokine leptin in regulating EC function and metabolism. Leptin
levels are higher in females and leptin treatment restores EC metabolism and function in the aortas of T1D mice.
Taken together, these findings inform the core hypothesis of this proposal: EC metabolism shapes EC function
via sex-specific, Nox1 and leptin-dependent mechanisms. This hypothesis will be tested in three aims. Aim
1 will investigate whether enhanced EC glycolysis impairs endothelial function by increasing Nox1-derived ROS
production and compromising eNOS-derived NO. Aim 2 will test whether sex steroid hormones and/or sex
chromosomes regulate EC glycolysis and function through changes in PFKFB3 and Nox1 expression, while Aim
3 will investigate whether EC leptin signaling positively regulates endothelium-dependent relaxation by reducing
glycolysis-mediated increases in Nox1 in T1D. With this Project #2, which is highly dependent on the
expertise provided by other Projects and Cores, we have the expectation to demonstrate that the leptin-
PFKFB3-Nox1 axis is a potential target for the treatment of diabetic vascular complications."
10847549,"Project Summary:
The goal of this Project 3 is to demonstrate the novel linkage between mitochondrial ROS (redox) signaling and
endothelial cell (EC) glycolysis orchestrated by mitochondrial dynamics protein Drp1 sulfenylation that promotes
reparative angiogenesis, which is impaired in diabetic peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Reactive oxygen
species (ROS) such as H2O2 derived from NADPH oxidase (NOX) and mitochondria at physiological level act as
signaling molecules to promote VEGF/VEGFR2-induced angiogenesis in ECs and neovascularization. By
contrast, excess ROS induced in diabetes impairs reparative angiogenesis. Little is known “how diffusible H2O2
signal can be specifically transmitted to promote therapeutic angiogenesis”. Signaling function of ROS is mainly
through oxidation of reactive Cys residues to generate “Cysteine sulfenic acid (Cys-OH)” (sulfenylation) which
is a key initial event in redox signaling. In addition, ECs utilize aerobic glycolysis via PFKFB3 as a major source
of ATP to promote angiogenesis. However, the mechanistic link between NOX-mitochondrial ROS
(mitoROS)/redox signaling and EC metabolism (glycolysis), which drives angiogenesis is poorly understood.
Drp1 GTPase is a key regulator of mitochondrial (mito) fission and its activity is regulated by post-translational
modification. However, the role of endothelial Drp1 in ROS-dependent VEGFR2 signaling and angiogenesis in
ECs and reparative neovascularization in vivo is entirely unknown. Here we hypothesize that VEGF/NOX-
derived H2O2 stimulates Drp1 sulfenylation to promote physiological mito fission and mito ROS production, which
drives glycolysis and angiogenesis by oxidative activation of AMPK as well as increased PFKFB3 expression in
ECs. This is impaired in T1D due to excess PFKFB3/glycolysis-ROS axis that induces oxidative inactivation of
VEGFR2 as well as hyperactivation of Drp1-excess mitoROS axis in basal ECs, which limits VEGF-induced
VEGFR2 signaling and angiogenesis as well as reparative neovascularization in PAD. Aim1 will determine the
role of endothelial Drp1 sulfenylation in ROS-dependent VEGF-induced angiogenesis in ECs as well as
reparative neovascularization in vivo and address the underlying mechanisms. Aim 2 will determine the role of
excess glycolysis-ROS axis as a mechanism limiting VEGFR2 signaling and angiogenesis as well as reparative
neovascularization in diabetes and address the underlying mechanisms. We will use innovative Cys-OH trapping
probe; BiFC-based protein-protein interaction; compartment-specific redox-sensitive biosensors; iEC-iDrp1-/- or
iPfkfb3-/- mice, Mito-Timer transgenic mice and newly developed cutting-edge CRISPR/Cas9-generated
“redox dead” Cys oxidation-defective Drp1 or AMPK knock-in (KI) mutant mice or Glyco-Lo KI mutant
mice that reduces glycolysis in the endothelium in an inducible manner. Our study will provide novel
insights into the restoring imbalance between EC metabolism (glycolysis) and ROS signaling via targeting Drp1
as a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment of ischemic vascular diseases. Project 3 is highly dependent on
the expertise provided by other Projects and Cores of this PPG."

10847988,"PROJECT 1: ABSTRACT
One of the critical unmet needs from both the scientific and therapeutic standpoints in the B-cell lymphoma field
is understanding how these tumors evade the normal checks and balances of the immune system they arise
from. A majority of B-cell lymphomas arise from the germinal center (GC) reaction, during which B-cells undergo
extensive and rapid shifts in epigenetic programming, including transient suppression of immune signaling
receptors involved in forming synapse-like interactions with GC T-cell subpopulations. Notably, the genetic
hallmark of these tumors are somatic mutations in epigenetic regulatory genes, among which those affecting the
histone acetyl-transferase CREBBP and the histone methyltransferase KMT2D are the most common, and
moreover are highly co-occurrent. Prior work from our group showed that KMT2D and CREBBP mutations have
a tumor suppressor effect and function by disrupting gene enhancer activity. In both cases this led to aberrant
and persistent repression of different sets of immune synapse genes. More recently, we have explored the
manner in which CREBBP and KMT2D mutations might cooperate to drive lymphomagenesis and have made a
series of surprising preliminary observations, such as finding that these proteins engage in biochemical synergy
at gene enhancers, and that their disruption seems to reprogram the immune microenvironment in ways not
previously known to occur. Such data lead us to hypothesize that KMT2D and CREBBP mutations result in
profound and cooperative suppression of a broad range of immune synapse genes, distinct from those affected
by either mutation alone. We postulate that KMT2D and CREBBP form a complex at key regulatory enhancer
and superenhancers with their combined loss disrupting the epigenetic and architectural state of the target genes
in such a way as to prevent their response to immune synapse signaling leading in turn to reprogramming of GC
immune microenvironment. Specifically, we propose that this is due to induced differentiation of specialized T
follicular helper cells into T follicular regulatory (TFR) cells, which support expansion of GC B-cells, prevent their
differentiation, and suppress T-cell mediated immune surveillance. Ultimately this leads to an immune
suppressive environment that prevents entry and activation of cytotoxic CD8 T-cells. Finally, we we predict that
therapeutic approaches specifically inhibiting the aberrant TFR axis in KMT2D/CREBBP lymphoma will enable
more effective and rationally designed combinatorial immunotherapy approaches for the successful treatment of
these tumors especially when coupled with epigenetic therapies that restore the aberrant chromatin
programming induced by CREBBP and KM2D mutations. Hence the outcome of this proposal aside from the
novel mechanistic findings, will be the implementation of rational multi-layer regimens that will restore immune
eradication of these tumors."

We seek to establish a summer experiential learning (EL) program for undergraduate biomedical engineering
(BME) students that focuses on health equity education through Biodesign immersion. The Biodesign process
is a systematic approach for the identification of unmet medical needs, the generation of novel technologies to
address them, and the development of commercialization plans to bring them into fruition (i.e., identify, invent,
and implement). We plan to capture key elements of these three phases through a unique EL framework that
combines needs identification with parallel research and development (R&D) activities on distinct projects. The
Specific Aims include: (1) rural and urban clinical immersion and needs identification; (2) parallel R&D
component to support a later-stage technology; (3) assessment of healthcare advancement metrics and
professional development by exploring the growth of the students' Engineering Habits of Mind (EHoM). The
proposed program is a strategic partnership between Virginia Tech (VT) and Carilion Clinic, an integrated
healthcare system in Southwest Virginia with a variety of rural and urban healthcare environments. The
improvement of health outcomes among rural patients is more intractable and provides fertile ground for
innovation. In the clinical immersion, teams will apply contextual inquiry methods with mentors in the
departments of surgery and nursing to identify design opportunities and develop EHoM in systems thinking and
problem finding. Preparation will include training on user-centered research methods, such as task analyses
for identifying stakeholder ""pain points."" The teams will plan and document their design research at the clinical
sites to create a database of >25 needs with supporting information related to stakeholders, existing solutions,
regulation, reimbursement, market, and the Social Determinants of Health (SDoH). Students will prepare a
product development plan on a design opportunity well-suited to improve patient care and promote health
equity. They will then recruit and lead a future senior design team to solve the associated challenge. The
concurrent R&D component of the program captures a majority of the EHoM through the signature design
pedagogy. Teams will be assigned to existing projects R&D projects at Carilion Innovation (Cl}, a specialized
technology transfer and invention development group for Carilion's internal providers. Students will carry
projects through reduction-to-practice and proof-of-concept testing at the Carilion Clinic Center for Simulation,
Research, and Patients Safety (CSRPS). Utilizing assigned projects will give students added exposure to
tinkering, verification and validation, fabrication technologies, and manufacturing. Building this knowledge base
will feed back into the clinical immersion component as an additional set of lenses for filtering needs. Further,
multitasking on needs identification and parallel R&D will prepare students to manage different sets of
deliverables and timelines in their future careers. Taken together, this program will offer a deep-dive into best
practices associated with identifying medical needs and serve as a career bridge for students planning to enter
the medical device industry."

Facility will provide investigators with the means to explore previously inaccessible design spaces and fabricate
intricate precision components and systems. To further support our efforts, Nanoscribe is considering the
establishment of a Center of Excellence (COE) at UA, catering specifically to users in the southwestern region.
This envisioned COE would provide valuable expertise and support to researchers utilizing the Nanoscribe
Quantum X Shape system, further enhancing the success and impact of micro-fabrication endeavors in the
region."
10851537,"Use of ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic, is currently on the rise both as a party drug and via off-label prescription. We have estimated recent increases in several domains including recreational use, poisonings, and seizures, which coincide with recent media coverage of results from trials about ketamine’s efficacy in treating depression, along with an increase in advertising of ketamine treatments for many other indications. Nonmedical use is commonly associated with adverse effects, and people who use illegally in particular are at risk for poisoning as illegal ketamine is no longer pharmaceutical grade and can be adulterated, placing people at risk for exposure to drugs such as fentanyl. We predict that a wave of nonmedical ketamine use is beginning and will be fueled by increasing acceptance and curiosity resulting from media, advertising, and popular culture exposure, and diversion of prescribed ketamine. To investigate the rapidly advancing ketamine landscape, this study will integrate data on 1) prescribing, medical use, and misuse, 2) recreational use, and 3) population-level data on availability and adverse events including poisonings and death. Informed by a robust conceptual framework, our multidisciplinary team will conduct this study in the New York City tristate area. Our aims are to: 1) monitor ketamine prescribing practices and availability via legal channels and determine their effect on shifts in medical use and misuse, recreational use, associated adverse effects, and drug diversion; 2) estimate trends, patterns, and correlates of recreational ketamine use and use severity among high-risk populations (nightclub/dance festival attendees and college students), and among people who use ketamine in these samples—deduce risky exposure to adulterants such as fentanyl; and 3) estimate and compare trends in ketamine use and use severity, availability, and related morbidity and mortality in the tri-state area and determine whether trends in use and adverse events are predicted by increasing prescribing and availability of both legal and illegal ketamine. We will address Aim 1 by quantifying and characterizing mental health clinics providing ketamine via surveys with clinicians who prescribe ketamine (n=320) and patients of mental health clinics who are prescribed ketamine (n=400). We will address Aim 2 through 6,400 screener surveys with an estimated 928 participants taking the expanded rapid survey focusing on ketamine use. Screeners will help us estimate prevalence of use while the full survey will focus on characteristics of use among people who use. We will also saliva-test those reporting past-48-hour use to test for exposure to >1,000 adulterant drugs including >100 fentanyl analogs. Aim 3 will be addressed by triangulating data from Aims 1 and 2 and contrasting it with ketamine-related secondary data on seizures (indicating availability), morbidity (poisonings), and mortality. This will be the first largescale epidemiology study to examine multiple aspects of increasing prescribing, medical use, misuse, recreational use, and associated adverse and iatrogenic effects of ketamine use. Results will inform policy to curb availability, as well as prevention, treatment, and harm reduction efforts."
10851444,"Cellular plasticity and regeneration after radiation damage in Drosophila
Cellular plasticity and regeneration after radiation damage in Drosophila
 More than half of cancer patients receive ionizing radiation (IR), alone or as a component of their
treatment (www.cancer.org). IR induces DNA damage to kill cells. Surviving cancer cells could, however,
regenerate the tumor, leading to treatment failure. While we understand much about how irradiated cells repair
damaged DNA or undergo cell death, how tumors regenerate remains incompletely understood.
 The overall objective of our research program is to understand how tissues regenerate after damage by
IR in vivo in a multicellular context, to identify and characterize the genes and proteins involved in this process,
and to develop genetic and chemical tools to manipulate the function of these regulators. Drosophila
melanogaster has been an ideal organism for this work because of precision lineage tracing tools, amenability
to genetic and chemical screens, and the ease of molecular analysis to uncover gene function. Cell death and
regeneration in Drosophila and vertebrates share conserved genetic and molecular features. Chemical
modulators of IR-induced regeneration we discovered in Drosophila behave similarly in human cancer models.
Therefore, what we learn in Drosophila is likely to apply to humans.
 Regeneration of Drosophila larval organs called imaginal discs occurs without a dedicated stem cell
pool. My lab identified a previously unknown mode of regeneration in Drosophila larval wing discs whereby a
specific subset of columnar epithelial cells in the future hinge region change fate to acquire stem cell-like
properties. IR-induced cell fate plasticity in Drosophila parallels the increasingly appreciated ability of cancer
treatments including IR to induce stem cell-like properties in non-stem cancer cells, a phenomenon implicated
in tumor re-growth and treatment failure. Progress in the current funding period includes the finding that IR-
induced fate change requires ribosome biogenesis and apoptotic caspase activity in hinge cells that are
nonetheless refractory to IR-induced apoptosis. These findings lead to a conceptually innovative working
model in which changes in the proteome through non-lethal caspase activity and increased translation capacity
act on top of changes to the transcriptome to affect cell fate change. Rigorous testing of this model will guide
our future activities that will include asking why cells change fate into one cell type but not another. Technical
innovation is inherent in quantitative assays for IR-induced cell fate plasticity. The ultimate goal is a
comprehensive understanding of how changes in the translated transcriptome are coordinated to promote IR-
induced cell fate plasticity in the context of organism development. What we learn will not only increase our
understanding of regeneration after IR damage but also will identify mechanisms that may be modulated to
improve treatment outcome in human cancers."
10851543,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Dysregulation of central monoamine (dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin) signaling is implicated widely in
neuropsychiatric and substance use disorders, but there is a fundamental knowledge gap in how monoamines
signal at the level of ion channels and individual synapses. It is well-established that serotonin-releasing neurons
in the dorsal raphe nucleus are driven to fire action potentials and release serotonin by noradrenergic input and
activation of metabotropic alpha1-adrenergic receptors. Recently, we discovered that alpha1-adrenergic
receptors depolarize serotonin neurons via coupling to the ‘orphan’ ionotropic delta 1 glutamate receptor
(GluD1R) ion channels. Intriguingly, prior research showed that metabotropic glutamate receptors also couple to
GluD1R in midbrain dopamine neurons and contribute to burst firing of action potentials. The signaling
mechanism between these metabotropic receptors and GluD1R ion channels requires G protein signaling but
what occurs downstream to activate GluD1R is not yet known. In addition to this G protein-dependent GluD1R
current, we found that GluD1R channels carry a G protein-independent tonic current that depolarizes the resting
membrane potential to promote action potential firing. The etiology of the tonic GluD1R current is still unresolved.
Together, these findings demonstrate that ionic current carried by GluD1R plays an unexpected and critical role
in potentiating the excitability of monoamine neurons. We propose to use mouse brain slice electrophysiology,
fluorescence imaging, and pharmacological manipulation to record GluD1R currents in serotonin neurons to (1)
delineate the postsynaptic signal transduction mechanisms between alpha1-adrenergic receptors and GluD1R;
and (2) determine whether GluD1R current is sensitive to naturally occurring cysteine-modifying agents like the
small transition metal zinc and the antioxidant ascorbate, in a manner similar to NMDAR current. Lastly, (3) in
midbrain dopamine neurons, we will determine the role of GluD1R in metabotropic receptor-dependent AMPAR
synaptic plasticity in physiological conditions and after in vivo exposure to cocaine. We will evaluate the in vivo
relevance of GluD1R current using a combination of imaging and behavioral assays in wild-type mice in
comparison with mice that lack expression of GluD1R and mice that express a mutated GluD1R that is ‘pore-
dead’ or non-conducting. The proposed studies are expected to be significant since they will identify key
molecular regulators of serotonin and dopamine neuron excitability through action on GluD1R and the mechanism
through which G protein-coupled receptors act upon GluD1R to modulate their ionic current. Our preliminary data
suggest these studies may reveal a metabotropic receptor-initiated signal cascade that has not yet been
observed in the central nervous system. Further, we anticipate gaining a significant understanding of the
contribution of GluD1R current in metabotropic receptor-dependent depolarization, induction and maintenance
of synaptic plasticity, and cocaine-related behavior."

Low bone mass is a major co-morbid complication of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA) in adolescents
and young adult women, including those with anorexia nervosa (AN) and exercise-induced amenorrhea (EIA).
We propose to test in an 12-month randomized controlled trial the hypothesis that administration of
romosozumab (vs. placebo) for 6 doses monthly followed by a single dose of zoledronic acid to amenorrheic
adolescents and young women with FHA receiving transdermal estradiol replacement (with cyclic progesterone)
and calcium and vitamin D supplementation who have not yet achieved peak bone mass will result in bone
accrual that exceeds that of normal-weight controls without FHA with the potential to normalize bone endpoints.
84 participants with FHA will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio in a double-blind fashion to romosozumab or identical
placebo injections monthly for 6 injections, to determine effects on bone mineral density (BMD), markers of bone
metabolism, and bone geometry and bone strength at various skeletal sites using dual energy x-ray
absorptiometry (DXA), high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT) and microfinite
element analysis (µFEA). This will be followed in all FHA subjects by a single zoledronic acid intravenous (IV)
infusion at 6 months to consolidate gains from romosozumab therapy. All participants with FHA will also receive
a 100 mcg transdermal estradiol patch (twice weekly) applied continuously, and 200 mg of oral micronized
progesterone for the first 12 days of each month, which are known to improve, but not normalize, bone outcomes
in FHA. In addition, 30 healthy controls will be followed prospectively for 12 months. All participants with FHA
and healthy controls will receive at least 800 IU of vitamin D and 1000 mg of calcium daily (RDA) to avoid effects
of suboptimal vitamin D concentrations on bone. There will be a one-month visit to determine whether
romosozumab exerts the expected acute osteoanabolic effects in the FHA group vs. placebo, as studies have
shown that the maximal anabolic effect of romosozumab is within the first month. We will determine whether
romosozumab increases areal BMD (by DXA) and improves bone geometry (assessed by HRpQCT) and bone
strength (assessed by microfinite element analysis) at 6 months in the FHA group compared with placebo. We
will also compare the romosozumab group to healthy controls to determine whether the rate of improvement in
bone endpoints exceeds that of healthy controls, resulting in catch-up and providing the anabolic boost
necessary to set individuals with FHA on the path to normalization of bone endpoints. Moreover, we will
determine whether 6 months of romosozumab followed by one IV zoledronic acid infusion improves BMD, bone
geometry, and strength at 12 months in girls and women with FHA more than placebo followed by zoledronic
acid and at a greater rate than in normal controls."

Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute (SBP) has 40 research labs specializing in cancer,
children’s health, stem cells, degenerative diseases of aging, as well as infectious and other diseases. Many
recent advances in medical research and healthcare rely on the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. Recently,
advances in functional genomic technologies have provided an unprecedented opportunity to understand
fundamental mechanisms underlying diseases initiation, progression, and relapse. Thus, these technologies
hold great promise in the identification of novel targets and innovative treatments.
In order to remain cutting-edge, the SBP Functional Genomics Core Facility seeks funding to acquire the
Beckman Coulter Biomek i7 Hybrid automated workstation. This fully automated system, with 8 independent
pipettes and interchangeable 96 and 384-multichannel liquid handling platforms, will replace our existing
outdated, underperforming Hamilton Microlab STAR (2005 model year, 96-well platform) and Agilent Bravo
(2010 model year, 384-well platform) equipment. Even after expensive software and hardware upgrades, both
the Hamilton STAR and Agilent Bravo models will still fall short of automating the desired library preparation and
screening workflows demanded by the NIH-funded projects that are currently being supported by our core facility.
A key part of this enhancement is the production and screening of large-scale arrayed CRISPR libraries, which
enables a wide variety of new scientific approaches not possible with pooled or small-scale arrayed CRISPR
library analysis. In contrast to the Hamilton STAR and Agilent Bravo, the new Biomek i7 enables streamlined
automation of multiple continuous pipelines and mitigates capacity limitations. Designated pipelines include high-
throughput production of bacteria, viral vector plasmids, recombinant viruses, and mammalian cell cultures, as
well as cell-based phenotypic screening and assay processing, which can be accomplished on a 96/384-well
platform.
This application is supported by eight major SBP users with active NIH-funded projects. As stated in the
application, the projects of all eight major users - together accounting for 77% of the Biomek i7’s available use
time (AUT) - will greatly benefit from the Biomek i7 automation to advance their proposed studies in diverse
human disease research topics including cancer, aging, muscular dystrophy, Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementia, and COVID-19."

 A unifying theme of my research program is to determine how RNA structure regulates gene expression
co-transcriptionally by affecting the activity of RNA polymerase (RNAP) or by affecting ribosome access to the
mRNA. Critical mechanistic insight into these processes will be obtained through comparative studies in
Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis by leveraging the differences of these two systems.
 RNAP pausing and transcription termination are fundamental events that regulate gene expression in all
organisms. NusA and NusG are general transcription elongation factors that have remarkable flexibility in how
they respond to pause and termination signals in bacteria, and we will determine how these two proteins
collaborate to maintain proper expression of the genome. Using RNET-seq, we identified 1600 NusG-dependent
pause sites throughout the B. subtilis genome. ~25% of these pause sites are in 5'UTRs, and the role that several
of these pauses have in regulating gene expression will be examined. The other 75% of the pause sites are in
open reading frames and the possibility that these pauses are involved in maintaining coupling of transcription
and translation will be tested. In addition, the structural basis for NusG-dependent pausing, and the cooperativity
of NusA and NusG in this process, will be investigated using cryo-EM. Whereas the KOW domain of E. coli NusG
interacts with ribosomal protein S10 for coupling of transcription and translation, this type of coupling does not
take place in B. subtilis, and the role of the B. subtilis KOW domain is unknown. However, our preliminary results
implicate this domain in co-transcriptional tRNA processing, and this exciting possibility will be examined.
Although E. coli NusG functions as an anti-pausing factor, the transcriptome-wide role of NusA on pausing has
not been examined and we will do so. Intrinsic transcription terminators consist of an RNA hairpin followed by a
U-rich tract. Using Term-seq we showed that NusA, NusG and Rho function as intrinsic termination factors in B.
subtilis. However, the roles that these proteins play in intrinsic termination in E. coli are unknown, and we will
determine those functions using engineered depletion strains for each protein.
 CsrA is a conserved RNA binding protein that binds to and regulates hundreds of mRNAs by affecting
their translation and decay. Our work indicates that it regulates numerous cellular processes, suggesting that it
is a master regulator of multiple stress responses. The extent of this regulon and how it affects metabolic changes
will be explored using a combination of in vivo CsrA-RNA footprinting, metabolomics, and regulatory studies. Of
particular importance, the footprinting methods will be applicable to essentially any organism or cell type.
 Another discovery-based theme of my research program will combine Structure-seq, a chemical probing
method for identifying RNA structural changes in vivo, with Term-seq to identify new RNA-based gene regulatory
mechanisms at an unprecedented scale. We will identify regulatory mechanisms that respond to metabolites and
stresses such as high temperature, and then determine the underlying molecular mechanisms of regulation."

Pre-mRNA splicing is essential for gene expression in all eukaryotes and errors in splicing cause genetic
disorders and many other diseases. A thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms of pre-mRNA
splicing has the potential to provide useful approaches for human disease therapy. The splicing of introns is
carried out through two transesterification reactions catalyzed by the spliceosome, a large RNA/protein
complex composed of five snRNPs (U1, U2, U4, U5, U6) and many non-snRNP related protein factors. The
spliceosome undergoes dramatic changes in a splicing cycle, generating the E, A, Pre-B, B, Bact, B*, C, C*, P,
and ILS complexes. Genetic, biochemical, and structural studies in the past four decades have generated
tremendous information on the mechanism of splicing, but significant knowledge gaps remain. Our goal in the
next 5 years is to use a combination of structural, biochemical, and genetic/genomics approaches to
understand the mechanism and modulation of alternative 5’ ss recognition, the mechanism of exon definition,
and the mechanism and function of transcription and splicing coupling. We envision that these projects will fill
several significant knowledge gaps and advance our understanding of the mechanism of splicing."

MDACC and one at a Partner site. To maximize the number and achievements of investigators we train, we will
leverage CTSA funding to enhance our program, developing skilled C&T investigators in the Texas Medical
Center TMC) (9,200 beds; 10 million encounters per year) and the 3 diverse medical centers that comprise our
partners. Our Program includes: 1) the Clinical and Translational (C&T) Research Curriculum (11 required
courses/workshops, provided in-person or by video training to each institution); 2) MS Courses & Degree in Clinical
Research (optional for Scholars and tailored to an individualized career development plan; and 3) our central
focus: the Intensive Mentorship Program, that has been highly successful in helping prior KL2 and other mentees
secure major grants, publish in high impact journals, and become institutional and national academic leaders.
Special strengths include our Scholars' research success involving multidisciplinary teams and other CTSA hubs;
improving the delivery, safety, and effectiveness of healthcare for women, children, and disadvantaged patients
of any age; advancing research methods using n-of-1 trials, Bayesian methods, hybrid implementation
effectiveness designs and economic analyses; and showing reduced health system costs to secure clinical
reimbursements that sustain and expand improved approaches to health care. Next cycle innovations will
augment these strengths, specifically train the NCATS-identified translational science competencies, and
promote learning health care (LHC) through an expanded LHC consultation service emphasizing comparative
effectiveness and dissemination/implementation, studies, a continuous community engagement program, and
IRB leadership to facilitate and advance exemplary comparative effectiveness research, trials of emergency
therapies, and implementation/de-implementation research. These and other Core features will promote the
career development of Scholars within a LHC system to most rapidly advance clinical care and the health of
diverse populations. Integration with the UM1, the T32s and the R25 is strong. With these innovations and our
track record, infrastructure, and institutional support, CTSA funding will predictably produce a large return by
developing innovative, collaborative, rigorous, and productive leaders in C&T science."
10843283,"A significant portion of the population is affected by tendon injuries. Due to limited
regenerative potential, these injuries are complicated by slow and imperfect healing. In order to
develop therapies to improve healing outcomes, it is important to understand the mechanisms
regulating adult tendon cells during homeostasis and healing. Tendon-derived stem/progenitor
cells have been identified in vitro and display stem/progenitor characteristics, including
clonogenicity, multilineage differentiation potential, and self-renewal. However, the identity and
activity of resident progenitor populations in the adult tendon are not well understood. We have
identified an adult tendon cell marked by Axin2-CreERt2 that displays progenitor-like activities in
vitro and in vivo. After tendon injury, Axin2+ cells proliferate, infiltrate the injury site, and express
Scx-GFP. In addition, we find their injury response is dependent upon the Wnt pathway. We
propose to use lineage tracing, genetic loss of function, and next generation sequencing
techniques to gain a mechanistic understanding of Axin2+ cells in the adult tendon during
homeostasis and healing. We will test the hypothesis that Axin2+ cells are a unique tendon cell
population that, through Wnt secretion and response, are key orchestrators of tendon healing.
First, we will test the function of Wnt signaling in maintaining Axin2+ progenitor cell identity during
homeostasis. Next, we will define the function of Wnt secretion and canonical Wnt signaling in
regulating Axin2 cell injury response at early and later stages of tendon healing. We will also test
if activation of canonical Wnt signaling promotes Axin2+ cell identities and injury response,
leading to improved healing outcomes. A mechanistic understanding of Axin2+ cell function is an
integral step towards expanding our fundamental understanding of adult tendon biology. This
knowledge could impact the design of new therapies to improve tendon healing in patients."

Membrane tension governs endocytosis, exocytosis, cell migration, mitosis, meiosis, membrane
transportation, and many other biological phenomena, but there are no tools to map and measure membrane
tension in vivo and in real time. Here, we seek funds to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel small molecule
imaging probe/contrast agent that produces changes in both fluorescence intensity and photoacoustic
intensity as a function of membrane tension. We will compare our probe and methods to the current state-of-
the-art: fluorescence lifetime and micropipette/tethering analysis. The technical advance provided by
photoacoustic imaging is in vivo imaging of membrane tension: Ultrasound waves are not absorbed/scattered
as much as photons and thus imaging through 3-5 cm of tissue is routine. The technical advance of
fluorescence intensity is ease of use: Unlike fluorescence lifetime, fluorescence intensity can be done with
most common microscopes. Our innovation is grounded in the use of novel conjugation switching chemistry
and novel photoacoustic imaging for in vivo imaging. Indeed, a probe that offers in vivo imaging of membrane
tension could facilitate fascinating new questions about disease and therapy to be addressed in subsequent
proposals using this probe: “How is membrane tension distributed across a 3D organ?; How does an organ’s
membrane tension change when it encounters a therapeutic?; and How does an organ’s membrane tension
change across the lifespan or with stressors?” This exploratory work will use the following aims to test the
feasibility of the contrast agent and gain new technical knowledge about its quantitative advances over the
state-of-the-art lifetime- and micropipette-based approaches. Aim 1 will synthesize and characterize the probe
using a logical yet innovative organic chemistry workflow. Aim 2 will use giant unilamellar vesicles with tunable
membrane tension to test the probe versus a commercially available fluorescence lifetime probe. We will use
a micropipette to establish the ground truth tension values and then compare the sensitivity of fluorescence
lifetime (gold standard) versus fluorescence intensity and photoacoustic intensity via five different vesicle
populations with unique membrane tension values. The imaging method with the steepest slope will be the
most sensitive—we expect that our probe will be more sensitive than lifetime because of its activatable nature.
Aim 3 will test the novel probe with cultured cells. We will control the membrane tension via osmotic pressure
and compare the imaging data of cells at hypo, hyper, and isotonic conditions. To validate the in vivo utility of
photoacoustic imaging, we will image cells locked into high or low membrane tension states beneath
increasingly thick pieces of tissue-mimicking materials—this experiment will be a proof of concept of in vivo
imaging of tension differences. This work is feasible because of Jokerst’s expertise in contrast agent
development and in vivo imaging. All needed tools and personnel are in place, and the work is ideally
responsive to RFA-22-126’s call for conceptual studies in technology development."
10824183,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In healthy skeletal muscle the extracellular matrix (ECM) provides structural support, facilitates lateral force
transmission, and contributes to cell signaling. However, certain muscle diseases can alter the ECM to the
detriment of muscle function. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is one such disease which is caused by a
mutation on the X-chromosome to the gene encoding dystrophin. The lack of functional dystrophin in DMD
leads to a severe loss of muscle fiber structural integrity, resulting in repeated cycles of muscle damage with
incomplete regeneration. This leads to the accumulation of ECM materials, termed fibrosis, which hinders
muscle stem cell (MuSC) function, decreases muscle strength, and increases muscle stiffness that all lower
the quality of life for patients with DMD. Fibrosis is also generally seen as irreversible, so there is a great need
for treatments that slow or prevent the progression of fibrosis in patients with DMD and other musculoskeletal
diseases. While previous research has shown that the architecture of collagen, the primary component and
load-bearer of the ECM, drives deficits in MuSC function and muscle mechanical properties, few studies have
tried to alter collagen architecture to restore muscle health. Thus, the proposed research aims to further
elucidate the mechanisms by which fibrotic collagen architecture drives muscle stiffness and impairs MuSC
regenerative capacity, and assess the ability of Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (collagenase) to ablate
collagen architecture, reduce fibrosis, and improve muscle health. Our central hypothesis is that mechanical
and regenerative deficits in muscle function due to fibrotic collagen architecture are reversible through
collagenase digestion of collagen fibers. Using the D2.mdx mouse, an established model of DMD, we will
perform experiments that clarify the stretch dependence of collagen alignment on muscle stiffness,
demonstrate the ability of collagenase to alter MuSC function on the fibrotic ECM, and evaluate the efficacy of
collagenase in reducing fibrosis and restoring muscle health. Aim 1 will utilize the label-free imaging method of
second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy with concurrent mechanical testing to connect dynamic
changes in collagen architecture to changes in passive mechanics of D2.mdx mouse muscles. Aim 2 will assay
the ability of MuSC to proliferate and differentiate on healthy and fibrotic decellularized matrices with or without
a collagenase treatment. Finally, Aim 3 will involve the use of intramuscular injections of collagenase to reduce
fibrosis and muscle stiffness while improving muscle strength in anterior and posterior hindlimb muscles of
D2.mdx mice. The results of these experiments will provide new insights into the importance of collagen
architecture to muscle mechanical and regenerative function, and the usefulness of collagenase in treating
muscle fibrosis."

The ability to install precise genetic changes is a longstanding goal in biology. While there are over 6,000 known
disorders with monogenic origins, estimates are that only 10% of these are currently treatable. Most genetic
variants associated with disease are single point mutations which are potentially correctable via systems that
exchange a single DNA base (base editors). Base editors treat point mutations by appending a deaminase
enzyme that catalyzes single nucleotide changes to a programmable DNA binding protein (Cas9) that localizes
the editor to its target. This technology has seen overwhelming success with adenine base editors (ABEs)
entering the clinic within just five years of their initial report. Notably, ABEs do not generate double-stranded
breaks, making them an ideal candidate for genome editing—especially in stem cells which suffer low genome
editing efficiency and large rearrangements or deletions in DNA in response to DNA cleavage. The correction of
point mutations in the genomes of stem cells has the potential to provide essential cell-based therapies for
immunodeficiency and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the capacity of this approach is limited by editing
promiscuity at neighboring bases. This constrains target selection to a narrow range of mutations where nearby
off-target edits would not negate the effect of the edit or induce additional pathogenic mutations. For instance,
mutations causing severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and Hurler syndrome are potentially reversible
by adenine targeting base editors, yet inaccessible by current methods due to the proximity of another editable
adenine bases to the target site. Therefore, there is an unmet clinical need for the advent of precision editors
capable of precisely targeting mutations in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to produce edited
cells for autologous transplantation. My proposal describes a two-pronged approach to developing precision
base editors that both extends existing technology and creates an entirely new kind of editing enzyme with
intrinsic properties that prevent off-target edits. Our approach provides key insights into genome editing
mechanisms that can be harnessed for treatment of a wide range of diseases."
10842996,"RNA modification serves as a major posttranscriptional mechanism to regulate gene expression. Recent
advances in high-throughput sequencing have exponentially expanded the breadth and depth of RNA
modification types, substrate varieties and biological significance in normal developmental processes and the
genesis/progression of human diseases, including cancers, virus infections, and many neurodegenerative
diseases. In eukaryotic cells, all nascent mRNAs are born with a 5' triphosphate group (ppp) and then
immediately modified with an m7G cap in the nucleus. tRNAs and rRNAs also initially bear a 5' ppp group but
lose it during maturation via RNA cleavage events. Eukaryotic cells stringently regulate the 5' ppp group to
generate a cytoplasm free of ppp-RNAs, allowing them to easily detect viral RNAs, some of which bear a 5'
ppp group. Whether the ppp group is subject to alternative modifications to alter RNA fates remains to be a
knowledge gap in the RNA field. Recent studies by the PI and others have demonstrated that RNA
polyphosphatases, which remove two phosphates from the 5' ppp group, play important roles in regulating
nuclear small RNAs and viruses. The PI is also studying another modification on the ppp group, the m2,2,7G cap
on ncRNAs including U1 and U2 snRNAs. The PI found that influenza A virus (IAV) prefers to snatch the caps
of ncRNAs and utilize them to generate viral RNAs with these caps in canonical and non-canonical cap-
snatching processes, the latter of which was discovered by the PI recently. The PI is studying a third nuclear
RNA modification, the m5C on piRNAs, a relatively unexplored but important research area, since piRNAs
usually serve as the sensors in innate immune responses. In all, the PI proposes to investigate these three
types of nuclear RNA modifications. Unlike the PI's previous study focusing on small RNA pathways, this
proposal primarily focuses on how proteins in this RNA polyphosphatase family, especially PIR-2, regulate
mRNA and lincRNA, as the PI discovered that these proteins play non-small RNA mediated essential roles in
C. elegans. The PI will identify the substrates and systematically examine if and how this polyphosphatase
family regulates DNA replication, RNA transcription and chromatin modification in a variety of cells including
germline cells and neurons. This study will discover a new mode of gene regulation, which utilizes nuclear
RNA polyphosphatases to alter nascent ppp-RNA fate. The PI will also study how m5C on piRNA modulates
RNA stability and functions in target binding and processing, as m5C on other RNAs. Moreover, the PI will
examine if IAV preferentially utilizes the m7G caps derived from nascent U1 and U2 snRNAs or the m2,2,7G
caps derived from mature U1 and U2 in the nucleus, and if RNA splicing mediated by U1/U2 snRNA is
compromised by IAV. The proposed research is original and innovative, and bears direct relevance with human
health and disease. Not only will this study generate new gene regulation tools for research and disease
treatment, but it also promotes next generation researchers, especially those underrepresented /underserved."

The genealogical structure for whole genomes can be described through Ancestral
Recombination Graphs (ARGs). ARGs are summaries that contain all of the information in
genomic sequencing data about processes such as demographic history, selection, and
recombination. The primary objective of this research is to develop a suite of computational
tools that use posterior sampling of ARGs in order to provide methods for testing hypotheses
about the distribution and evolution of genomic variation, and in general, to provide improved
quantification of mutation, recombination, selection, and demographic history. These methods
will be full likelihood/Bayesian methods that can take advantage of the rich population genetic
information in whole-genome sequencing data. We expect the methods to scale up to allow
posterior sampling of ARGs from a coalescence prior for many hundreds, or perhaps thousands,
of genomes. We will make an open-source, user-friendly, flexible, and integrated program
available to other researchers that will allow them to test a wide range of demographic and
evolutionary hypotheses on their own data. We will also develop associated methods for
ancestral inference of past migration and the geographic location of ancestors of an individual.
Additionally, we will develop improved methods for quantifying spatiotemporal patterns of
natural selection affecting the genome. We will apply the methods to modern and ancient DNA
to test hypotheses about the relative contribution of demographic processes and natural
selection for shaping the landscape of phenotypic variation in Europe, including disease
susceptibility. We will also use the methods to revisit an ongoing controversy of the relative
importance of changing mutation patterns and changing generation times in shaping the
pattern of human mutation variation. Finally, we will use the methods to develop more
accurate human recombination maps and to test hypotheses about recombination rate
variation.
 In addition to this, we will develop new Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods
for estimating Developmental Lineage Trees (DLTs) using mitochondrial heteroplasmies and
single cell DNA sequencing. We will also develop methods that can jointly analyze single cell
RNA sequencing and DNA sequencing data to make joint models of DLTs with associated
transitions in expression state. Such explicit temporal models of cell differentiation will be
central in the translational aspects of cell specific analyses, in particular for predicting the
effects of various forms of medical intervention."
10851856,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We propose to investigate the neurobiological basis of alcohol addiction focusing on epigenetic factors that
underlie individual vulnerabilities. A key feature of alcohol addiction is alcohol drinking despite negative
consequences or at the expense of other rewards. These clinically-significant “compulsive” behaviors occur in a
minority of individuals that consume alcohol – a strong indication that individual vulnerabilities are at the core of
disease. Our previous work has shown that behavioral changes associated with alcohol addiction manifest in
response to persistent epigenetic reprogramming of transcription networks in specific brain regions and neuronal
populations. Epigenetic mechanisms integrate genetic risk and environmental factors such as stress and alcohol
itself. Therefore, elucidating the epigenetic networks associated with the addictive state is a major goal of the
research community, but unfortunately current understanding of these networks and the downstream impact on
neurocircuits involved in alcohol dependence remains limited. In preliminary studies, we investigated a
vulnerable minority of laboratory animals that self-administer alcohol despite pairing with punishment (foot-
shock) – a compulsion-like alcohol self-administration behavior. Using a combination of techniques to profile
gene expression patterns in the amygdala of compulsive rats, we identified a critical role for Enhancer of Zeste
2 (Ezh2), the histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27) methyltransferase and catalytic component of the polycomb repressive
complex 2 (PRC2). Subsequently, we found that pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 attenuates compulsivity in
rats. Therefore, we propose to clarify the role of EZH2 and H3K27 methylation in regulating transcription
programs in the amygdala, a brain region linked to addiction that is critical for integrating response to adverse
stimuli. Using a relatively novel and highly-efficient epigenetic profiling technology called CUT&RUN we will
profile H3K27me3 specifically in amygdalar neurons and non-neuronal cells of compulsive rats. In parallel, the
functional consequence of differential H3K27me3 will be defined using RNA sequencing. Additional preliminary
data show that inhibition of GABAergic protein kinase C delta (PRKCD) neurons in the amygdala reduces
compulsivity. To further investigate the role of PRKCD-neurons, we will selectively manipulate their activity using
chemogenetics, and assess the effects on compulsivity. These experiments will utilize a recently validated
transgenic rat model that we have created where expression of Cre-recombinase is driven by the endogenous
Prkcd promoter. Using the PRKCD-Cre rat and a Cre-inducible nuclear tagging approach, we will define
differential H3K27me3 levels and gene expression patterns specifically in PRKCD-neurons of compulsive rats.
Finally, we will knock down EZH2 specifically in PRKCD-neurons to define its role in compulsivity with brain-
region and cell-type specificity. Since epigenetic enzymes/effectors, including EZH2, have emerged as
druggable therapeutic targets for complex psychiatric diseases such as alcohol addiction, our study could provide
a new avenue for developing much-needed therapeutic strategies."
10851858,"Project Summary
Pathological substance use disorders are a set of devastating psychiatric conditions marked by a pattern of
escalating and out of control drug intake and an often-persistent cycle of withdrawal and relapse. One of the
critical questions for translational research on substance use disorders is how exposure to drugs of abuse
leads to such persistent dysregulation in patterns of motivated behaviors. Long-lasting changes to chromatin
structure underlie the persistent dysregulation of gene expression and behavior seen in substance use
disorders. Regulation of chromatin structure requires the integration of a myriad of signals from the
environment, and there is a robust literature demonstrating that levels of key metabolites and cofactors
regulate chromatin dynamics. Notably, nearly all enzymes that modify histones or DNA utilize key metabolites
as substrates or cofactors in their catalytic activity. Therefore, availability of key metabolites directly affects the
ability of a cell to make alter chromatin structure. Our preliminary studies show that repeated exposure to drugs
of abuse markedly alters the serum and brain metabolome. Many of the dysregulated metabolites are those
known to be critical cofactors for the function of epigenetic writers and erasers. Parallel to this, genes involved
in the regulation of cellular metabolism in the nucleus accumbens were markedly altered even after prolonged
withdrawal. Taken together, these data identify the metabolome as a novel means to target epigenetic
regulation in substance use disorders. Initial studies will utilize drug self-administration and reinstatement
coupled with serum and brain metabolomics to further identify metabolites that correlate with drug intake and
drug seeking. Subsequent studies will determine how manipulations of metabolite signaling alter behavioral
response and brain epigenetics. Systemic manipulation of metabolites via dietary restriction or
supplementation will clarify the role of these metabolites on behavior, and cell-specific gene manipulations of
key metabolic enzymes will add specificity and clarity to observed effects. Metabolic manipulations will be
coupled with cell-specific chromatin profiling via ATAC-sequencing, quantitative mass spectrometry to identify
changes in histone modifications, and chromatin-associated protein complexes in order to examine the
interaction of behavioral and epigenetic effects. Finally, we will utilize cutting edge transgenic mouse
technology to create inducible point mutations in epigenetic writers/erasers at key metabolite binding sites to
assess the effects on behavior and chromatin structure when enzyme-metabolite interactions are prevented.
These studies will define a new field of research targeting metabolic regulation of chromatin in substance use
disorders and will identify novel translational research targets that will markedly increase our understanding of
epigenetic regulation in substance use disorders."
10851859,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Kidney function is critical to maintaining effective circulating volume (ECV), electrolyte homeostasis and blood
pressure (BP). Dysregulation of fluid and electrolyte transport in the kidney is central to hypertension (HTN)
and cardiovascular disease (CVD) progression. Na+, K+, and volume homeostasis are maintained by regulation
of renal ion and water transporters expressed in tubule specific patterns; K+ balance also depends on
regulation of muscle transporters. HTN and CVD are a function of sex, age and lifestyle; less frequent in
females than males below 65 yr and more common in post-menopausal females vs males over 65 yr; salt
sensitivity of BP increases in both sexes with age. We have reported sex differences in the abundance of
transporters along the nephron in both Sprague Dawley rats (SDR) and C57BL/6J mice, and used
computational models to establish the functional implications of the dimorphisms, e.g. more robust natriuretic
responses in young female vs male SDR. How kidney and muscle transporter profiles respond to life cycle
transitions from development through aging and menopause is not known. Our overarching goal is to
combine experimental and computational approaches to determine how kidney (and muscle) functions
adapt to maintain ECV, electrolyte and fluid homeostasis in response to life cycle challenges in both
male and female rats and mice: from development to aging, through the female-specific challenges of
lactation and menopause, and the common challenges of dietary Na+ and K+. Aim 1. Test the hypothesis
that baseline kidney function adapts during life cycle in a sex-specific manner to maintain fluid and
electrolyte homeostasis. When do transporter sex differences appear? Is the more robust natriuresis in
young females vs males still evident at 12 mo? Do muscle K+ transporters exhibit sex dimorphisms that impact
K+ adaptation with age? We will utilize the Four Core Genotype mouse model to attribute dimorphisms along
life cycle to gonadal hormones vs sex chromosome complement. Aim 2. Describe mechanisms of female
kidney adaptation to lactation. Do kidney and nephron function adapt to maintain maternal homeostasis
during peak lactation at minimal cost? Do kidney function, ECV and electrolyte homeostasis return to baseline
after lactation cessation? Does extrarenal K+ homeostasis (skeletal muscle K+ transporters and [K+]) adapt
during/after lactation? Aim 3. Test the hypothesis that menopause and age reduce sex differences and
increase salt-sensitivity. Does ovotoxin-induced menopause change female kidney and muscle transporter
profiles and function? Is salt-sensitive hypertension sex dependent? Exacerbated after menopause?
Accomplishing these aims will fill important gaps in knowledge about sex-specific mechanisms of Na+, K+, and
volume homeostasis and physiology throughout life cycle, thus, providing a better understanding of the female
advantage in CVD and guiding therapeutic targets in both sexes across life cycle."
10851863,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Solid tumors can shape their microenvironments to maximize their growth and metastatic potential. The formation of new
nerve fibers within and around tumors can alter tumor behavior, and higher densities of nerve fibers in the tumor
microenvironment are associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with oral, prostate, breast, gastric, pancreatic and
other types of cancer
. Preclinical and pathological studies have described neoneurogenesis, the process by which cancer
cells induce the growth of nerves into tumors, as analogous to neoangiogenesis, in which cancer cells release factors that
elicit the growth of blood vessels into the tumor. However, the exact mechanisms that drive nerves to infiltrate tumors and
support their growth and progression is unknown. Preliminary research shows that cancer cells `communicate' with neurons
through shuttling of p53-dependent RNA species that further induce tumor innervation.
The hypothesis of this study is that
axonal sprouting and autonomic reprogramming of existing nerves occur as a result of orchestrated miRNA shuttling from
cancer cells to neurons and via activation of the transcriptional programs that establish neuronal identity and that infiltration
of tumors by autonomic neonerves enables tumor progression. The neonerve's phenotype includes
transformation into a
sprouting cell able to infiltrate and interact with other cell types, the release of adrenergic neuroactive molecules, and the
development of neurogenic inflammation. Each of these acquired capabilities may promote tumor progression and resistance
to therapy.
The proposed research is innovative because it will capitalize on new concepts in cancer biology and advanced
model systems to yield insights into the mechanisms of tumor progression and identify new targets for cancer therapy.
This
cross-disciplinary proposal will combine expertise from oncology, neurodevelopment, cell biology, neurobiology, cancer
genetics, pathology, and biostatistics to pursue three specific aims: (1) Delineate the signaling events that occur between
cancer cells and neurons during tumorigenesis, using pharmacologic and genetic approaches to understand how cancer cells
cause normally quiescent neurons to reprogram and continually sprout to sustain neoplastic growth. (2) Elucidate the drivers
of tumor-associated neuronal reprogramming. By using human-derived sensory neurons, we will determine how the normal
nerve response to signals from cancer cells supports cancer progression. (3) Characterize sensory nerve reprogramming and its
role in oral cancer progression. Using a genetically engineered syngeneic mouse model, we will elucidate the neural-tumor
interactions that lead to neurogenic inflammation and promote oral cancer progression. Our long-term goal is to elucidate
the reciprocal nerve-cancer signals that drive cancer progression to identify novel targets for therapy. Once the signals that
induce tumor innervation are known, therapeutic approaches to target this critical component of tumor biology can be
developed to improve survival, treatment responses, and patients' quality of life."

program is based within the Division of General Medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center with
continued close collaboration with the Harvard Medical School (HMS) Osher Center for Integrative Medicine,
an inter-institutional program that facilitates the development of research and education across Harvard in the
growing field of complementary and integrative health (CIH) and whole person health. Our T32 training
program has continued to evolve with the field and align with NCCIH strategic plan and goals. We have
focused broadly on mind-body therapies (including mindfulness-based interventions, yoga, tai chi, and
‘placebo’ effects) that are long-standing areas of faculty expertise, as well as other areas within CIH such as
chiropractic and acupuncture. Areas of more recent interest and expansion include nutrition and supplements,
IM interface with technology, and a move towards implementation. Faculty mentors have funded research
programs in IM/CIH research and impressive track records of successful mentoring. All trainees take part in the
Program in Clinical Effectiveness, an intensive summer curriculum in epidemiology, biostatistics, and health
services research at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Some trainees continue at HSPH
to earn a Master’s degree in Public Health during the first two years. Throughout the fellowship, weekly
programs including seminars in research methodology/skills (e.g. study design, statistical considerations, grant
writing) and a core program in evidence-based IM provides specialized clinical, research and scholarly skills in
CIH. Fellows can also take in-depth courses in CIH in order to acquire practitioner skills/certification to inform
their research. Most of the trainees’ time is devoted to mentored research, with careful matching of trainees
with appropriate mentoring teams with relevant and specific expertise. Each trainee uses skills learned in the
classroom to develop, conduct and analyze at least two original investigations under the direction of
experienced faculty mentors. Research may span clinical trials, epidemiology, health services research, basic
science and translational methodologies from bench to bedside. Fellows also participate in experiential retreats
and have opportunities to teach IM at HMS. Fellows may further cultivate clinical skills in IM at one of several
available integrative practice sites. Principal research mentors, clinical preceptors, and curriculum advisors
supervise each fellow’s development. Over the first 23 years of the fellowship, 36 fellows have completed the
program (38 in June 2023), 31 have earned an MPH, 22 have been awarded or have pending K career
development awards as a direct result of their T32 training. As one additional metric of success, many of our
graduates are now leading researchers in the field and direct prominent CIH programs nationwide."

ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Despite significant progress to reduce global malaria incidence and related deaths over the past 20
years, this positive trend is now in a state of decline. Data from 2021 indicated that the global milestones
set out in WHO's global technical strategy for malaria 2016-30 (GTS) were not met, with both case and mortality
targets being off track by 48%. Increasing insecticide and drug resistance, limited sensitivity of field diagnostic
tools and declining investments are urgent contributory factors to the decline in coverage and effectiveness of
routine control interventions. To date, the true contribution of non-falciparum malaria (NFM) – often presenting
as asymptomatic infection – to the global disease burden remains underappreciated. While P. vivax (Pv) has
risen in research priority over the past 10 years, research into the fundamental epidemiology and transmission
dynamics of of P. ovale (Po wallikeri [Pow] and Po curtisi [Poc]) and P. malariae (Pm) has been largely neglected.
Quantifying the asymptomatic malaria reservoir in human populations has been a priority topic for current ICEMR
programs, yet deeper insight into this issue is elusive. A concurrent biological threat to malaria control is the
invasion and spread of Anopheles stephensi Liston (AS) into the Horn of Africa and movement westward into
Central and West Africa, presenting a serious concern to control efforts across the continent. Sympatric Pv and
AS will change the dynamics of malaria control, as not only is AS a competent vector for Pf/Pv where both are
endemic (e.g., South Asia), it has also demonstrated preference for similar breeding habitats as the urban
dengue vector Aedes aegypti, risking a return of malaria into highly dense, urbanized cities and towns throughout
SSA. How the expansion of AS to areas with different climates and ecologies will affect malaria transmission
remains to be seen. Tackling existing obstacles to achieving global malaria elimination goals thus remains only
partly, if not poorly addressed. The West-Central Africa Enhancing Malaria Epidemiology Research through
Genomics & Translational Systems biology (Émergents [fr.]) ICEMR program leverages successful, well-
established collaborations, unique advanced research and training infrastructures, and an extensive Sub-
Saharan Africa (SSA) research network to address emerging and challenging issues in malaria transmission in
the region. Émergents ICEMR is built on a proven research platform and consortium of World Bank, Wellcome
Trust-, African Academy of Sciences-, and NIH/CDC-funded centers of excellence in Cameroon and Nigeria.
This Émergents ICEMR program will focus research in Nigeria and Cameroon, proposing three interwoven
programmatic packages (PP): PP1. Genomic Epidemiological Mapping (GEM) of non-falciparum malaria
(NFM; Pv, Po, and P. malariae [Pm]) to quantify the parasite reservoir, measure transmissibility to
mosquitoes and evaluate the insecticide resistance status of mosquitoes with NFM parasite infections;
PP2. Bionomics, Ecology, & Control of An. stephensi (BECA) against the background of endemic primary
and secondary anopheline vectors; PP3. Advancing Clinical and Entomological Surveillance (ACES)
through emergent diagnostic and translational systems biology platforms to address emerging issues
viz. asymptomatic malaria and non-falciparum malaria transmission in the context of Malaria Elimination
and Eradication (MEE). To date, there has been no ICEMR program in the Central-West Africa nexus, which
appears to be the leading edge of two new invasive species to Sub-Saharan Africa, namely Pv and An. stephensi
in two bordering countries with high malaria burden (Nigeria and Cameroon). Émergents ICEMR directly fills
this unmet public health vacuum. Considering the established network of collaborations westward to Ghana and
southwards to the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Émergents ICEMR can serve as an effective springboard
to support and advance malaria research and training in an expansive region representing diverse malaria
burden, eco-epidemiological landscapes, and emerging risk to the invasive species."
10832511,"The goal of the Mayo Clinic Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) is to increase
the number of individuals from underrepresented groups who choose biomedical research careers.
We are motivated by the concept that a diverse research environment fosters more innovative research
than a homogeneous environment. Many training programs seek to enhance the diversity of the biomedical
research workforce. However, few of these programs emphasize the translational research linkage between
basic science and improved health. Biomedical research training programs for diverse students often fail to
emphasize practical development of the leadership skills actually required for successful careers in
biomedical research. The Mayo Clinic Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) bridges
these two gaps by preparing learners from underrepresented (UR) groups for successful matriculation and
completion of research-intensive biomedical science PhD programs. During the next funding cycle, we will
maintain the 22-year success of our program while increasing recruitment of UR students, improving
mentorship experiences, and providing leadership skills. Indeed, 22 years of experience have guided the
optimization of these elements.
Specific aims:
Aim 1. Recruit and retain UR learners (nine total per year) into basic science or translational
research programs at Mayo Clinic while achieving a 75% matriculation rate into PhD or MD-PhD
programs. Since its origin in 2006, the Mayo PREP has recruited and trained 63 post-baccalaureate UR
learners. Forty-three (68%) matriculated into competitive PhD or MD-PhD programs. Of those students,
95% successfully completed a doctoral degree or are on track to do so. We will continue to recruit and train
learners through our proven curriculum with its focus on intensive enrichment activities toward individualized
academic and professional development. We will maintain objective program evaluation by leveraging self-
assessment tools and surveys such as the Undergraduate Research Student Self-Assessment. We will use
pre-entrance surveys to identify the needs of each learner and craft an appropriate plan to ensure timely
learner success. We will provide access to tutors and will encourage participation in Mayo Clinic’s
institutional resource groups (MERG) to assist in learner retention. We will facilitate networking by weekly
structured meetings and quarterly meetings in a social setting with graduate students and faculty from UR
groups. We hypothesize that these tactics will continue to be effective in increasing the number of UR
learners entering PhD programs.
Aim 2. Develop a pathway that cultivates successful long-term mentor-mentee relationships to
facilitate successful research careers. Individual development plans (IDPs) have been used to identify
gaps in research experiences and develop strategies for addressing these gaps. However, IDPs can be
inadequate if not accompanied by diligent follow-up with accountability and adjustments in a changing
research environment. We will therefore implement Post-baccalaureate Advisory Committees (PACs). Each
PAC will involve the research mentor, program director, and at least one UR faculty member. The PAC will
develop an individualized plan for launching the learner into a successful career. The PAC will identify and
discuss career goals, analyze experience gaps, plan educational activities, verify career milestones, and
propose approaches for addressing professional needs. This structure will emulate a graduate student
thesis advisory committee. We hypothesize that PACs will lead to improved long-term mentor-mentee
relationships that will facilitate (greater than 90%) retention of former PREP PhD graduates in biomedical
sciences research.
Aim 3. Create a platform for developing critical thinking and leadership skills outside of the
classroom and laboratory setting. In 2016 the Mayo Clinic PREP pioneered its biennial Scientific
Innovations Through Diverse Perspectives (SITDP) conference, completely organized by students to
promote development of practical leadership skills not taught in the classroom or laboratory. The pilot was
so successful that it has now been adopted by multiple institutions. We will continue to develop this
successful platform that develops teamwork, teaching learners to work together with diverse individuals who
have different objectives, points of view, and personalities. This platform provides opportunities to broaden
professional networks, and discuss career paths with leaders in academia, industry, law, science policy,
science writing, and other fields. We will also encourage learners to participate in Mayo Graduate School’s
entrepreneurial course involving individuals from different academic, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds to
develop a product that can be used to change the life of a patient population. We hypothesize that exposure
to these opportunities will lead to the development of critical skills for becoming leaders in the biomedical
sciences."

Advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is an aggressive disease with high mortality
rate, primarily resulting from the transcriptional addiction driven by Androgen Receptor (AR) signaling. The
evolutionarily conserved multi-subunit Mediator complex plays a central role in the regulation of transcription by
virtue of its ability to functionally bridge gene-specific transcription factors with the RNA polymerase II-
associated basal transcription machinery. MED1 is a key component of the Mediator complex and is
responsible for targeting and anchoring the complex to a broad range of nuclear receptors, including AR. We
have identified phosphorylation of MED1 catalyzed by CDK7 transcriptional kinase is required for its interaction
with AR and as a rate-limiting step in AR-mediated transcription. The underlying hypothesis of this proposal is
that the CDK7 mediated phosphorylation of MED1 is necessary for the formation and stability of MED1-AR
complex at the chromatin in both naïve and anti-androgen refractory CRPC which could be targeted by CDK7
specific inhibitors. The goals of this grant application are to investigate the mechanistic basis of MED1-AR

10832515,"Cisplatin has been used clinically to treat a variety of cancers for nearly four decades. Along with second and
third generation platinum analogs, it is still one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic drugs with over four
billion dollars in annual sales. Despite its wide use, clinical limitations including drug toxicity to normal cells and
the development of drug resistance in cancers has limited the impact on cancer treatment. Understanding how
to overcome these clinical limitations is critical for achieving better cancer responses and increasing overall
patient survival. To this end, we have established a novel mechanistic model in which two specific DNA repair
pathways, base excision repair (BER) and mismatch repair (MMR), work in conjunction to mediate cisplatin
efficacy. This mechanistic model is based on the specific cis/carboplatin DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL)
structure in which extrahelical cytosines that flank the ICL are targets for deamination. In this proposal, we
have novel preliminary data that supports a family of proteins, APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases, in initiating the
deamination of the extrahelical cytosines adjacent to the cisplatin ICLs and activating the BER pathway.
Following deamination of the cytosines to uracil, the BER pathway is initiated by uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG)
cleavage to produce an abasic site that is subsequently processed by AP endonuclease (APE1) to cleave the
phosphodiester backbone adjacent to the cisplatin ICL. Polymerase beta (Polβ) is recruited to the 3'-OH site
and synthesizes DNA downstream of the cisplatin ICL, but with poor fidelity. We were the first to demonstrate a
dependence on Polβ nucleotide misincorporation to activate MMR, which ultimately inhibits productive ICL
DNA repair and maintains cisplatin sensitivity. In our preliminary data, we demonstrate a dependence on
APOBEC3 expression to mediate cis/carboplatin sensitivity and activate the BER response. This is further
supported by clinical data in which high APOBEC3 expression can mediate a clinical response to cisplatin. We
also demonstrate that mutations in Polβ that affect polymerase activity result in hypersensitivity to cisplatin as a
consequence of enhanced inhibition of ICL DNA repair. This suggests that the clinically relevant mutations in
Polβ, which have been observed in ~30% of tumors tested, that alter polymerase function (e.g., decreased
catalytic activity and/or decreased fidelity) may be beneficial for better clinical response to cis/carboplatin
treatment as a result of the futile processing of cis/carboplatin ICLs. Here, we propose to (i) elucidate the
APOBEC3 family members involved in cisplatin sensitivity and ICL cytosine deamination, (ii) assess the
interplay between APOBEC3 members and BER/MMR proteins in cisplatin ICL processing and (iii) identify
clinical Polβ mutations that mediate cisplatin efficacy and determine the dependence on APOBEC3 activity.
Therefore, this project will provide a comprehensive mechanistic model for how APOBEC3 proteins activate
BER/MMR to maintain cis/carboplatin efficacy and help establish a new paradigm in cis/carboplatin
chemotherapy utilizing specific Polβ mutations and altered APOBEC3 expression for patient stratification."
10833039,"Abstract: Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with exposure
to repetitive head trauma and characterized by accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein (p-tau). The p-
tau pathology of CTE is enhanced by post-traumatic neuroinflammation and microvascular damage. Common
clinical symptoms of CTE include cognitive impairment, mood and behavior changes, and parkinsonism. Other
p-tau based neurodegenerative disorders associated with parkinsonism include progressive supranuclear palsy
(PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD), two distinct sporadic tauopathies with no known association with
head trauma, neuroinflammation, or microvascular damage. CTE, PSP, and CBD are definitively diagnosed only
at postmortem examination. CTE p-tau contains tau isoforms with three repeats (3R) and four repeats (4R) while
PSP and CBD are exclusively 4R tauopathies. In PSP and CBD, p-tau pathology in motor regions (MRs)
correlates with parkinsonism, but parkinsonism in CTE is less well understood. This knowledge gap led us to
hypothesize that microvascular injury and inflammation play critical roles in accumulation of 3R and 4R p-tau in
MRs in CTE, and that MR p-tau burden will be associated with parkinsonism in CTE. We further hypothesize
that MR p-tau burden in CTE will be positively associated with duration and dose of previous head trauma
(measured as repetitive head impacts (RHI)) in CTE. To address our hypotheses, we will use postmortem tissue
from neuropathologically confirmed cases of CTE, PSP, and CBD for immunohistological and proteomic
analysis, as well as corresponding clinical data. The role of RHI exposure in the development of MR p-tau
pathology in CTE will be definitively established through the inclusion of RHI-naïve controls, RHI-exposed
controls that did not develop CTE, and cases of PSP and CBD. In Aim 1, we will quantitate 3R and 4R MR p-tau
burden in CTE compared to PSP and CBD, and characterize disease-specific cytopathology with multiplex
immunofluorescent staining to determine increased MR p-tau pathology in CTE. In Aim 2, we will quantitate MR
neuroinflammation and microvascular pathology and nigral dopaminergic cells in CTE compared to PSP, CBD,
RHI-naïve and RHI-exposed controls using immunohistochemistry, tissue clearing, and protein immunoassay to
establish increased MR inflammation, microvascular pathology and loss of dopaminergic cells in CTE. In Aim 3,
we will use available clinical data to assess associations among RHI exposure, MR p-tau pathology, and
antemortem parkinsonism in CTE. Previous work by the McKee Lab and BU CTE Center (Sponsor and Co-
Sponsor) and preliminary data have validated the proposed techniques. We will delineate the unique
inflammatory features, microvascular alterations, and p-tau pathology in MRs in CTE that are distinct from PSP
and CBD, and the correlation between MR p-tau pathology and parkinsonism in CTE, in order to help identify
diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for CTE and other tauopathies."
10833040,"Intermediate neural progenitor cells (INPs) are transient amplifying fate-restricted progenitor cells generated from neural
stem cells (NSCs). Transient amplification of INPs dramatically boosts the number and diversity of neurons/glia produced
from NSCs and thus increases the brain complexity, whereas defects in the generation or cell fate commitment of INPs
could lead to developmental neurological disorders and brain tumor formation. The long-term goal of this project is to
elucidate genetic regulatory network that controls the generation and cell fate commitment of INPs using the Drosophila
type II neuroblast (NB, the Drosophila NSC) lineages as a model system. Similar to NSCs in developing gyrencephalic
brains, type II NBs produce large lineages by generating transient amplifying INPs. The newly generated immature INPs
(imINPs) undergo a maturation process to become fate-committed mature INPs. Defects in INP maturation will lead to
dedifferentiation of imINPs back to the NB fate and subsequent tumorigenic overproliferation of type II NBs. Thus,
Drosophila type II NB lineages provide an excellent model for studying the generation of brain complexity and brain
tumor formation. Recent findings from our lab and others show that maturation of INPs requires activation of the Fez
transcription factor Earmuff by the Ets family transcription factor Pointed P1 (PntP1), which is also expressed in type II
NBs to specify their identities. Erm then promotes INP maturation by exerting an inhibitory feedback on PntP1 in imINPs.
Meanwhile, activation of Erm by PntP1 requires inhibition of self-renewing factors such as bHLH proteins Deadpan and
Notch target E(spl)mγ in imINPs. Previous studies suggested that termination of Notch signaling in imINPs requires
Numb-mediated degradation of Notch and the retromer complex-mediated trafficking mechanism to prevents aberrant
endosomal accumulation and activation of Notch, but it is not clear whether any other mechanisms could be involve in
regulating Notch signaling and its target expression in type II NB lineages. In this proposed project, we will investigate
novel post-transcriptional mechanisms that regulate Notch signaling in type II NB lineages and INP maturation. The
molecules we propose to study in this project all have human homologs and have been implicated in the development of
various human cancers including glioblastoma. Therefore, deciphering the functions and mechanisms of these molecules
in INP development will provide important information for understanding pathogenesis of related developmental
disorders and various cancers.

10833145,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The candidate, Laya Ekhlaspour, MD, is dedicated to advancing diabetes management by decreasing the
burden of diabetes care. This proposal will provide a structured clinical research training experience with
formal mentorship that will enable Dr. Ekhlaspour to become an independent clinical researcher with expertise
in closed loop systems. Currently, carbohydrates are considered the primary and major determinant affecting
postprandial glucose control and the insulin bolus is based solely on the carbohydrate content of the meal
along with the blood glucose at the time of the bolus. Given the known benefits of normalizing postprandial
glucose excursions, the goal of this research is to specifically address problems related to providing adequate
insulin coverage for meals that have variable fat and protein content that might result in both early
hypoglycemia and prolonged hyperglycemia, when automated insulin systems are used.
This proposal will take advantage of existing data collected during an observational study at the Barbara Davis
Center, and the feasibility closed-loop trials at Stanford. In order to characterize the effect of macronutrient
food content on postprandial glucose levels, a retrospective review of meals with known glucose, protein and
fat content combined with CGM and insulin values in both open loop and closed loop situations will be
conducted. This analysis will provide data to allow modeling for insulin requirements with meals of variable
patterns of postprandial glycemic levels. It will also determine whether this modeling will allow for setting the
percent of insulin required upfront and how long the insulin delivery needs to be extended in pumps which
allow for extended meal boluses. The result of this analysis can be used in closed-loop control real-time
modeling of meal boluses when there is a real-time adaptation to food absorption patterns, which will
contribute to eventual fully closed-loop glucose control. The developed model will be based on assessing the
hourly glucose and insulin requirements which could be integrated into prandial dosing algorithms in closed
loop systems in order to optimize postprandial glycemic control. The long-term goal is to have a fully-closed
loop algorithm, which will recognize the need for additional insulin with a high fat or protein meal based on the
CGM postprandial tracing and insulin requirements during closed-loop control. This will reduce the burden of
diabetes management significantly because the patient does not have to announce a meal.
The proposed studies will provide the preliminary meal data for modeling of meal-responses that will account
for both the carbohydrate, protein and fat content of the meal without user input. The following step will be to
validate this model through in silico experiments and then conduct a randomized, controlled trial of the
implementation of a potential refined meal algorithm that could handle postprandial glucose levels without an
extended bolus as part of a competitive R01 grant application."

The overall objective of our research is to determine how chromosome structure influences gene
transcription, DNA replication and repair, with special emphasis on identifying and characterizing the chromatin
remodeling machines that control chromosome dynamics. Notably, genetic experiments have revealed ATP-
dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes as essential regulators of virtually every chromosomal process, and
their dysregulation leads to a variety of diseases, including cancer. Our research efforts can be organized
into three inter-related areas: (1) Mechanistic studies of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes,
focusing primarily on the structure and function of the 14-subunit, SWR1C remodeler; (2) Investigating roles for
the INO80C remodeler in DNA replication and the maintenance of genome stability; and (3) Probing how the
expression of newly replicated genes is repressed following replication fork passage, a process termed
transcriptional buffering. The SWR1C remodeling enzyme catalyzes a novel, ATP-dependent histone
exchange event that controls the deposition of the H2A.Z histone variant within nucleosomes that flank
promoters of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II, as well as nucleosomes that flank centromeres and
replication origins. Mammalian homologs of SWR1C and INO80C, including the p400/Tip60 and hINO80
complexes, are key for proper stem cell function, genome stability, development, and gene expression. How
SWR1C catalyzes ATP-dependent deposition of H2A.Z remains largely unknown, and our proposed
mechanistic studies will include ensemble and single molecule fluorescence-based assays to define steps of
the histone dimer exchange reaction, as well as a combination of mass spectrometry and cryoEM methods to
probe how SWR1C distinguishes different nucleosomal substrates.
Studies from us and others have demonstrated that chromatin dynamics play a large role in regulating
transcription of both coding and noncoding RNAs, and disruption of this balance can impact genomic stability.
In particular, our work on INO80C has found that it prevents pervasive noncoding transcription from impinging
on replisome function in both yeast and mammalian cells. We propose a variety of genomic methods to probe
key unanswered questions: How does INO80C block noncoding transcription? How does transcription impact
fork structure? Does INO80C collaborate with the conserved forkhead transcription factors to organize origins
into a nuclear compartment? Our in vivo studies will extend to transcriptional regulation during S phase. We
have used Nascent transcript sequencing to confirm that newly replicated genes are transiently repressed 2-
fold until the subsequent G2 phase. Termed “transcriptional buffering” this process is conserved in mammals
and is believed to prevent transient aneuploid states during S phase. How buffering is established and
removed is not known, and here we propose to identify replication-linked assemblies that establish buffering
and to use genomic and molecular genetic approaches to probe their function.

Project 3 seeks to determine whether specific modifications to CD4 CAR T cells can enhance their ability to suppress HIV and reduce the latent HIV reservoir. These modifications include protecting CAR T cells from T cell exhaustion and infection, improving the frequency and tissue distribution of these cells, and ultimately exploring whether they can synergize with latency reversing agents (LRA) and CD19 B cell-specific CAR Ts to co-target HIV and B cell cancer. Specifically, we will leverage the expertise of Project 1 (prevent or reverse T cell exhaustion), Core B (preferred CAR integration sites), and Project 4 (CAR T manufacturing platform) to build upon our preliminary data demonstrating the ability of CD4 CAR T cells to suppress HIV in vivo. We will test these concepts in vivo utilizing a humanized mouse model that infuses T cells from well-controlled HIV-infected individuals to accomplish the following goals: Aim 1: Identify approaches to protect CD4 CAR T cells from dysfunction in vivo. AIM 2: Identify approaches to enhance the frequency and tissue distribution CD4 CAR T cells in vivo. Aim 3: Determine the in vivo efficacy of CAR T cells to co-target the HIV reservoir and CD19+ tumors. Therefore, utilizing a humanized mouse model of HIV infection, we hypothesize that enhanced CD4 CAR T cells will be capable of controlling HIV and targeting the HIV reservoir, providing insight into the mechanisms required to achieve a functional HIV cure"

Persons who inject drugs (PWID) are at elevated risk for HIV and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) due to needle
sharing and unsafe sexual practices. Amidst the unprecedented opioid epidemic, injection drug use (IDU) has
increased in the rural areas of the Deep South. Recent outbreaks of HIV and the ongoing HCV epidemic
among PWID living in the rural USA underscore the importance of promoting HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis
(PrEP) and HCV care, and medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) for PWID. Traumatic experiences, like
Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), may lead to IDU, unsafe sexual practices, lower HIV testing, lower
PrEP use, higher perceived stigma, and lower resilience in later life. Tailored behavioral intervention for PWID
is urgently needed, particularly given the health disparities experienced by PWID living in the rural Deep South.
One innovative approach is to reach PWID via telehealth interventions for promoting PrEP, HCV care, and
MOUD. Thus, the scientific objective of this K01 is to assess barriers and facilitators that PWID, living in the
rural areas of Georgia and South Carolina, face in obtaining PrEP, HCV care and MOUD, and then use these
findings to inform the development of a theory-driven, trauma-informed, and resilience-based telehealth
intervention designed to increase willingness to uptake care. The career development objective of this K01 is
to obtain the comprehensive mentored training necessary to develop expertise in improving HIV prevention,
HCV care and MOUD for PWID in the Deep South through telehealth interventions. It is supported by the
highly productive research environment at the University of Georgia and a team of accomplished researchers
in HIV and HCV prevention and care, MOUD, trauma-informed care, resilience-based stigma reduction, and
telehealth intervention development and implementation. This mentored training experience will provide
expertise in behavioral intervention development; adaptation of existing evidence-based interventions;
telehealth intervention development and implementation; theater testing methods; randomized trial designs;
analytic techniques for assessing intervention feasibility, fidelity, acceptability, usability, and efficacy. Training
outcomes are linked to three specific aims. In Aim 1, I will assess the perceptions of PWID and healthcare
providers and policymakers to identify barriers to and facilitators of PrEP, HCV care and MOUD uptake in the
context of intersecting stigma. Using these findings in Aim 2, I will develop a theory-driven, multi-component
telehealth intervention to improve HIV prevention, HCV care and MOUD uptake among PWID with 6 bi-weekly
sessions. In Aim 3, I will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of the telehealth intervention with a
randomized pilot trial with 50 PWID living in the rural Deep South. This project is responsive to the NIDA
priorities of trauma research, prevention services, and social determinants of health to optimize HIV prevention

The INSPIRE-ASP Trial (INtelligent Stewardship Prompts to Improve Real-time Empiric Antibiotic
Selection for Patients) for Abdominal and Skin and Soft Tissue Infections
 The INSPIRE-ASP Trial (INtelligent Stewardship Prompts to Improve Real-time Empiric Antibiotic
Selection for Patients) for Abdominal and Skin and Soft Tissue Infections is a cluster-randomized trial to
improve judicious antibiotic prescribing for non-critically ill hospitalized patients with abdominal infections or
skin and soft tissue infections. Currently, over half of non-critically ill patients with one of these infections
receive extended-spectrum antibiotics when less than 5% have an antibiotic-resistant pathogen. The goal of
this trial is to advise physicians to prescribe standard- vs extended spectrum empiric antibiotics based on an
algorithm that estimates each patient’s personalized probability of having an antibiotic-resistant infection. This
personalized probability is based upon routinely-collected patient information in the electronic health record
and local prevalence of resistant organisms in abdominal or skin and soft tissue infections.
 This trial will compare routine care under hospital-based antibiotic stewardship programs to the
enhanced program using the predictive algorithm plus audit and feedback to reduce unnecessary empiric
prescribing of extended-spectrum antibiotics. In our first aim, we will develop disease-specific prediction
algorithms for abdominal infections and for skin and soft tissue infections. In our second aim, this predictive
algorithm will be integrated into the computerized provider order entry (CPOE) system to prompt physicians
when selected antibiotics are discordant with the estimated need for that antibiotic. Physicians will be prompted
to use standard-spectrum antibiotics when the risk of an antibiotic-resistant infection is low. Sixty hospitals will
be randomized to either routine care or the CPOE prompt intervention plus feedback. This 18-month study will
evaluate ~53,000 patients with abdominal infections and ~37,000 patients with skin and soft tissue infections.
 This trial will evaluate the ability of a real-time risk calculator plus audit and feedback to reduce
unnecessary extended-spectrum antibiotics while maintaining good clinical outcomes as measured by length-
of-stay and transfer to an intensive care unit. These methods will be readily applicable to other electronic
health record prescribing systems."
10840410,"Abstract:
Early and accurate diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) is critical for planning, treatment, and
research referral, but demands time and expertise often unavailable to primary care providers. Speech and
language are often impaired early in the disease course of several NCDs. Previous research has demonstrated
the diagnostic potential of computer speech analysis (CSA), with differences between healthy controls and
disorders such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease. However, there are several
additional steps that must be taken to make CSA a diagnostically viable screening tool. This proposal includes
a career development plan providing the applicant with training, mentorship, and experience in the following
areas in order to bring CSA techniques into clinical practice: 1) computational linguistics and paralinguistics, 2)
longitudinal markers of disease, and 3) design of novel technology for dissemination. As part of this training,
academic and professional skills, including ethics in research, will also be expanded. Uniquely qualified
mentorship and advisory teams have been selected to ensure the success of the proposed training and
research.
The proposed study is a prospective, longitudinal, observational, cohort investigation of two distinct research
groups. The first group is a highly selected and well-characterized research cohort of healthy control,
Alzheimer's disease, and MCI subjects (Group A). In Group A, the performance and reproducibility of a
machine learning algorithm will be improved to distinguish Alzheimer's disease and MCI from healthy controls
using CSA. Multiple regression and voxel-based morphometry will be used to better understand what may
drive group differences in CSA measures in Group A as well. Clinical applications of this algorithm will then be
assessed in a clinic-based cohort of patients with different NCDs (Group B) in order reduce spectrum bias
likely present in prior studies. As sub-aims in both groups, possible further improvement of the algorithmic
outcomes with longitudinal CSA measures will also be examined. The overall objective is to develop intuitive,
reliable and reproducible CSA-based clinical measures by correlating them with established neuropsychiatric
and imaging markers, determining their efficacy in clinical populations, and determining how they change over
time. As a result, this research will validate specific speech traits as useful diagnostic markers of
neurocognitive disease and explain why those markers differ between patient groups, both of which are major
steps towards the design of novel and easily implemented tools in the screening of NCDs such as Alzheimer's
disease."
10840412,"Clinical trials testing type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) inhibitors failed in endocrine-
sensitive and resistant breast cancer. These trials failed to include targeting of the insulin receptor (IR)
and essential component of the IGF signaling system. Further, data from patients with endocrine resistant
breast cancer showed that insulin receptor (IR) is more highly expressed in breast cancer cells than IGF-
1R. While it may seem futile to target IR, data show the fetal isoform of IR, IR-A, is more highly
expressed than the adult isoform IR-B in cancers. Thus, it may be possible to create a cancer specific
inhibitor of a highly expressed receptor for breast cancer treatment.
We hypothesize that targeting of IR alone and in combination with other breast cancer therapeutics will
be an effective therapy. Moreover, specifically targeting IR-A will be cancer specific with little impact on
glucose homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, we propose three specific aims: 1) Engineer IR-A
antagonists using small synthetic protein ligands via directed evolution; 2) Demonstrate IR-A regulation
of the breast cancer malignant phenotype compared to IR-B and define a mechanism; and 3) Evaluate the
efficacy of an IR-A specific antagonist, our existing IR-A and IR-B antagonists, and IGF-1R antagonists
alone and in combination in breast cancer model systems
Major advances in breast cancer have been the direct result of understanding and targeting key growth
regulatory signals. Based on the failure of trials targeting the IGF-1R, we now have clear evidence that IR
play a critical role in breast cancer development. Just as we were at the among the first to develop IGF-1R
inhibitors, we have shown that IR inhibitors also may be used to target breast cancer. Completion of this
proposal will further the development of new targeted breast cancer therapies. Cancer specific IR may be
accomplished by development of an IR-A specific inhibitor. Given the growing number of women with
hyperinsulinemia, creating a cancer specific inhibitor of IR could have significant impact."

Close to two-thirds of the over 1.7 million U.S nursing home (NH) residents have a cognitive impairment such
as Alzheimer’s disease or a related dementia (ADRD), and are at high risk of hospital transfer. Reducing
avoidable hospitalizations for NH residents is a national priority due to the negative effects on resident health
and high Medicare and Medicaid costs. NH-to-hospital transfers result in > $2.6 billion in expenditures
annually, harm to residents from physical and emotional relocation stress, and is avoidable in as many as 60%
of cases. Avoidable NH-to-hospital transfers include transfers for conditions that can be safely and effectively
managed in the NH. Early illness recognition and treatment could prevent the need for hospital transfer
altogether, ultimately reducing morbidity and mortality in residents with ADRD while controlling costs. NH-to-
hospital transfer decision-making is complex and relies on timely transmission of information among the
interdisciplinary team. Unfortunately, many NHs rely on antiquated communication methods (e.g., phone, fax)
rather than leveraging modern, convenient, and low-cost options, like text messaging (TM), which could
improve health information sharing. Complicating the decision-making process about residents with ADRD is
the progressive loss of language impacting the individual’s ability to communicate. We expect that
communication among health care team members differs for NH residents with and without ADRD. Our dataset
provides an ideal and novel opportunity to apply natural language processing and social network analysis to
TMs shared among an interdisciplinary team about NH resident transfer. We propose to examine the content
of TM using the age-friendly health system 4M framework, which includes four evidence-based elements of
high-quality care (what Matters, Medications, Mentation, and Mobility). The 4M framework addresses the core
issues that should drive all decision making in the care of older adults and is a way of systematically rethinking
care in ways that improve patient health and satisfaction. A critical need exists to examine how convenient,
low-cost communication options like TM can reduce avoidable NH-to-hospital transfers of residents with
ADRD. Our aims are to: 1) Identify documentation of the 4Ms in health information shared by the
interdisciplinary team through electronic TM two weeks prior to NH-to-hospital transfer of residents with ADRD;
2) Estimate the effects of the 4Ms found in TMs on avoidable NH-to-hospital transfers; and 3) Compare

10840444,"Although leading HIV-1 vaccines now routinely elicit potent NAbs, 2 problems are 1) NAbs usually target strain-
specific ""glycan holes"", limiting breadth, 2) NAbs are inconsistent among vaccinees. Regarding the latter point,
we have found that eliminating glycan head group clashes reveals consistent tier 2 NAbs in all vaccinated
animals, suggesting that NAbs often fail to navigate glycans. In stark contrast, broad NAbs (bNAbs) from HIV-
1+ donors frequently contact glycans rather than avoid them. Therefore, we hypothesize that, by promoting
NAb-glycan contacts, we might improve vaccine breadth & consistency. Here, we propose sequential
heterologous prime-boost (SHPB) immunizations to try to elicit bNAbs to 2 conserved protein/glycan epitopes
(V2 & fusion peptide; FP). Both sites accommodate multiple NAb binding modes, facilitating epitope focused
approaches. In Aim 1, we will identify a panel of 5 diverse, multi-V2 bNAb-sensitive, well-expressed trimers.
Although high trimer expression is essential, such Envs are uncommon. 2 ways to obtain useful trimers will be:
1) to test various V2-sensitive ""special"" strains & 2) KI V2-sensitivity into high-expressing strains. Selected Envs
will be modified to: 1) Plug glycan holes, 2) KI the common FP variant 1 (FP8var1) sequence/KO the N611
glycan (regulates FP exposure). In Aim 2, we will try to improve vaccine NAbs, using virus-like particles (VLPs)
expressing trimers from Aim 1. CH01 HC KI BL6 mice express the UCA of the CH01 NAb heavy chain (HC) amid
a mouse HC repertoire that can combine with diverse mouse LCs. These mice can potentially generate NAbs to
additional targets like FP. Since early events shape NAb responses, following initial KLH-FP8v1 priming a variety
of concepts will be tested in 3 subsequent VLP shots, including glycosidase-digested VLPs to minimize clashes
or immunogenic foreign glycans to promote early NAb-glycan contacts. Later VLP shots will be kept consistent
to expand NAbs arising from earlier shots. 5 mice will be sacrificed at an intermediate timepoint & the rest after
the final shot, allowing us to study NAb ontogeny. The best priming regimen will be determined primarily from
neutralization kinetics, potency, breadth & consistency, & from molecular genetics criteria. This regimen will be
re-tested in mice where CH01 precursors are reduced to physiologic frequency by adoptive transfer & in CH01
HC x Balb/c F1 mice that also exhibit reduced CH01 HC frequency & a more robust genetic background to
potentiate NAb development. Having identified effective priming shots, assembled SHPB regimens will be tested
in the same F1 mice to try to improve breadth. Variables will include overlapping or non-overlapping sequential
shots, increasing strain diversity, & increasing epitope stringency. Finally, we will test leading regimens in Trianni
mice expressing polyclonal human IgG. Serum neutralization of vaccine & non-vaccine strains will be monitored.
MAbs will be rescued using VLP probes & analyzed for SHM, V gene use, & H/L pairings. NAb titers, breadth,
effects of glycan changes, specificity, glycan array activity & ontogeny will be investigated. Overall, we hope to
advance HIV vaccines by identifying regimens that induce glycan-dependent, V2 & FP-targeted NAb breadth."

hyperopia, keratoconus and astigmatism. However, the developmental mechanisms that generate
appropriate corneal curvature are not well understood. This proposal will use the Drosophila corneal lens as
a simple model system to investigate the development of curvature, and will test whether it shares common
molecular and developmental mechanisms with the mammalian cornea. The project is based on data
showing that the conserved Blimp-1 transcription factor is essential for external curvature of the Drosophila
corneal lens, and that it acts in the peripheral secondary and tertiary pigment cells rather than in the central
cells that secrete the bulk of the extracellular corneal lens material. The possibility of an analogous function
for mouse Blimp1/Prdm1 is suggested by its enrichment in the limbal epithelial cells at the periphery of the
adult cornea. The first aim will investigate the transcriptional network that controls Drosophila corneal lens
development. In the absence of Blimp-1, the C/EBP homologue Slow border cells (Slbo) is highly
upregulated, and Slbo overexpression, like loss of Blimp-1, results in externally flat corneal lenses. The
hypothesis that slbo repression is a major function of Blimp-1 will be tested by inactivating both genes
simultaneously. This aim will also identify other critical transcription factors downstream of Blimp-1, and will
test whether transient hormonally regulated expression of Blimp-1 in the eye is important for the temporal
control of differentiation. The second aim will determine how the peripheral pigment cells contribute to
corneal lens curvature. Two possibilities will be investigated: that pigment cells secrete protein components
that localize to the peripheral corneal lens and give it structural properties distinct from the central region,
and that force exerted on the corneal lens through its attachments to pigment cells controls the pattern of
curvature. The third aim will explore possible conservation between insect and mammalian corneal
structures. CG43333, a gene that is repressed by Blimp-1 in the Drosophila retina and contributes to the
abnormal corneal lens phenotype of Blimp-1 mutants, is homologous to Transforming growth factor beta-
induced protein, a frequent target of mutation in human corneal dystrophies. The effect of disease mutations
on CG43333 accumulation and localization will be examined to determine whether they reproduce features
of corneal dystrophy. Human corneal epithelial cells and corneal organoids will be used to establish whether
human BLIMP1 has target genes in common with Drosophila Blimp-1 in the cornea. Finally, the
developmental expression pattern of Blimp1 in the mouse cornea will be examined to determine whether it
is consistent with a role in corneal curvature. These experiments will elucidate how curvature is imparted to
refractive structures composed primarily of extracellular matrix, and will establish the Drosophila corneal
lens as a model to understand corneal development and disease."

10852059,"Project Summary – Project 3 (Fungus)
 A high skin fungal burden is a defining feature of Candida auris, and this burden is
associated with increased risk of disease. The first step in this process is the ability of strains to
attach and adhere, on both biotic and abiotic surfaces. This attachment also is the first step in
the formation of biofilms, which are linked with both persistence and antifungal drug resistance.
However, the cell biology and genetic circuitry underlying the ability of C. auris to colonize the
skin are not known. Our long-term goal is to identify the genetic determinants and regulation of
C. auris skin colonization and thus persistence and transmission between individuals.
 This application details experiments to address a fundamentally important gap in our
knowledge of mechanisms by which C. auris is a successful human fungal pathogen. We
propose three complementary genomics approaches to explore the biology of C. auris skin
colonization. We recently developed genetic tools for interrogating this organism, giving us
unprecedented power to analyze the genes required for C. auris colonization. In Aim 1, we will
use a population genetics and genome-wide association approach to identify naturally-occurring
variants that are associated with increased attachment. In Aim 2, we will use a forward genetics
screening approach and an in vitro model to uncover new effectors and regulators of C. auris
skin attachment. In Aim 3, we will use experimental evolution to identify variants of concern for
skin colonization, and connect this with functional experiments to test the impact of these
variants. Together, these studies will advance new concepts for how C. auris can regulate
adherence, colonization, and outbreak potential."
10852008,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The thymus, which is the primary site of T cell generation, is extremely sensitive to insult, but also has a
remarkable capacity for endogenous repair. Even though there is likely continual thymic involution and
regeneration in response to everyday insults like stress and infection, profound thymic damage caused by
radiation injury leads to prolonged T cell lymphopenia. Consequently, identification of therapies that can boost T
cell reconstitution in recipients after a dose of radiation is a clear priority.
 We have previously identified two distinct pathways of endogenous thymic regeneration, centered on the
production of the regeneration factors IL-22 by innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), and BMP4 by endothelial cells (ECs);
both of which mediate their regenerative effects by targeting thymic epithelial cells. More recently we have found
that the trigger for these distinct regenerative pathways hinge on the balance between forms of cell death, with
immunologically silent apoptosis (which is abundant in thymocytes during steady-state) suppressive to the
regenerative program. On the other hand, after thymic damage caused by radiation injury, we found a switch
toward immunogenic cell death, with the resulting release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)
sufficient to promote regeneration. Specifically, we identified that intracellular Zn was released after radiation
injury, where it could signal through the G-protein coupled receptor 39 (GPR39) to stimulate production of BMP4
and IL-23, a key upstream regulator of IL-22 production. Separately, we also found that the release of the
prototypical DAMP, ATP, was able to signal directly on thymic epithelial cells through purinergic (P2) receptors
and promote their expression of Foxn1, key microenvironmental drivers of T cell development. Importantly, our
preliminary data also suggests that each of these pathways can be therapeutically targeted to improve thymic
recovery following radiation damage in young mice. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that
modulation of pathways associated with these DAMPs can be used as a countermeasure to improve immune
function after radiation injury by stimulating the generation of new T cells in the thymus. Specifically, our proposal
has the following aims: (1) To validate and optimize the targeting of GPR39 or P2 receptors to improve the
production of new T cells and immune function after radiation injury; (2) to examine the ability of the thymus to
respond to regenerative signals across mouse lifespan and sex; and (3) to comprehensively evaluate the
potential for targeting GPR39 or P2 receptors to improve thymic function after radiation damage across mouse
lifespan and sex.
 The studies outlined in this proposal not only have the potential to define important pathways underlying
tissue regeneration across lifespan but could also result in innovative approaches to enhance T cell recovery
after radiation damage."
10851998,"ABSTRACT
The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a key CNS region involved in the reward and reinforcement
of natural substances and drugs, such as cocaine. Hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih)
is a key participant in the fundamental intrinsic properties of dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the
VTA. The ion channels that carry Ih are comprised of HCN subunits, predominantly the HCN2 in
the VTA. Alteration of Ih due to drug exposure has been shown after cocaine sensitization (CS).
This change in Ih may be a common physiological mechanism in central reward/reinforcement
pathways that contributes to addiction. Epigenetic mechanisms like histone deacetylation are
responsible for some crucial neuronal changes that occur following chronic drug administration.
This project will study the epigenetic regulation of the Ih function during the development of CS
and on the Intermittent access self-administration (IntA) model. The IntA in our opinion better
simulates human drug consumption. The specific aims will include: 1) To investigate the VTA
epigenomic profile after CS, IntA and Histone Deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi); 2)
Electrophysiological examination of Ih in VTA DA neurons after CS, IntA and HDACi; 3) To
measure changes in HCN2 subunits in the VTA after CS, IntA and HDACi; 4) To investigate if in
vivo shRNA targeting HDAC2 alters the development of CS, IntA and Ih properties of VTA DA
neurons. Examination of cocaine-induced epigenetic changes in the VTA can provide key
information about neuroadaptations that occur during the development of addiction. The reversal
of these epigenetic modifications by histone deacetylase inhibition might provide possible
avenues for therapeutic pharmacological intervention."
10851999,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cancer comprises a diverse group of diseases with significant morbidity and mortality. Nearly all common
cancers exhibit some form of sexual dimorphism, for example in incidence, prognosis, or response to therapy.
This dimorphism has been hypothesized to derive from differences between males and females in hormones,
sex chromosomes, and environmental exposures; however the molecular basis of these disparities remains
largely unknown. An understanding of this dimorphism is fundamental to precision medicine in cancer, and
may lead to discovery of novel biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and improved outcomes. We propose to
discover the molecular basis of sexual dimorphism in cancer though the following Aims: Aim 1 will
characterize sexual dimorphism in gene expression and its regulation within and between tumor types
of NCI's The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Leveraging TCGA, we will characterize sexual dimorphism at
the transcriptome level and its potential genomic and epigenetic causes within and across cancers. Aim 2 will
characterize sexual dimorphism in the heritable genetic component of cancer susceptibility across
common cancers. Utilizing data from the largest genome-wide association studies of cancer we will search for
differences in the genetic architecture between males and females. We determine what proportion of the
heritable component of each cancer is shared across sexes, and also estimate how much sex-specific sharing
across cancers. Using multiple genetic models, we will perform sex-aware association studies to identify
genetic variants that affect males and females differently. We will test a model for genetic risk, whereby the
same alleles affect both sexes, but the lower-risk sex would require more or stronger genetic risk factors to
develop disease. We will test for specific risk or protective factors encoded on the sex chromosomes that affect
the sexes differentially. We will test for gene-sex interactions whereby autosomal loci act in a sex-dependent
manner, with or without hormonally-mediated or other sexual dimorphism acting at the gene expression
level. Aim 3 will characterize sexual dimorphism in response to therapeutics and define the molecular
features and mechanisms contributing to that dimorphism. Utilizing molecular and phenotypic drug
response data from over 1000 cancer cell lines from the Cancer Genome Project (CGP), we will build sex-
specific predictive models of drug response that we will then apply to gene expression data from the full set of
TCGA tumor samples to impute a sex-specific drug response for each TCGA sample. We will correlate
imputed drug responses to TCGA tumor molecular features, with focus on those identified in Aims 1 and 2 and
candidates suggested by our preliminary data and the literature. We will functionally validate predicted sexually
dimorphic response to therapy using cell models, including panels of lymphoblastoid cell lines, human
hepatocytes, and cancer cell lines. The results of this study will define genetic and genomic features that
underlie sexual dimorphism in cancer biology, susceptibility, and response to therapeutics."
10849554,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Obesity and associated metabolic disorders are among the most common and costly health concerns
confronting Western nations. The University of Washington (UW) has been a pioneer in cutting-edge research
into mechanisms regulating energy homeostasis and how defects in this system contribute to these disorders.
Integral to this research effort are support services provided to the research community by the NIDDK-funded
Nutrition Obesity Research Center (NORC). The mission of the UW NORC is to support research in nutrition
and obesity, enhance our understanding of causal mechanisms and identify novel, effective and safe
treatments for these disorders. In support of this mission, the UW NORC Energy Balance Core has provided a
research core infrastructure to investigators for over 20 years that allows comprehensive assessment of
energy balance via the simultaneous measurement of energy expenditure, energy intake, substrate utilization
and physical activity in rodent models. This S10 grant application seeks to upgrade, expand and transform our
capacity to support metabolic research by requesting funds to purchase a new, state-of-the-art 16 cage
Promethion Core indirect calorimetry System from Sable Systems International. Our original Columbus
Instruments OxyMax indirect calorimetry system is no longer operational and our current 16 cage Sable
Systems Promethion Core system is sufficiently old (>13 years) that several parts necessary for routine
maintenance and repair are no longer supported by the company. In the coming months, therefore, the very
real possibility exists that we will no longer be able to either support funded research or honor commitments
made (in the form of letters of support supplied to investigators for inclusion in their NIH grant proposals). At
the same time, demand for our services currently exceeds capacity, resulting in long wait times that further limit
productivity. To address these concerns, we request funding to support the purchase of new equipment that
will not only increase throughput, reducing wait times and improving scientific productivity, but also offer
exciting new capabilities while ensuring that commitments made to our research community are honored.
Specific features of the new equipment we seek include 1) computer-controlled food access hoppers to allow
for pair-feeding or time-restricted feeding studies, 2) metabolic cages designed for use with optogenetics and
other sophisticated neuroscience techniques such as fiber photometry that enable manipulation and/or
monitoring the activity of discrete neuronal populations while also quantifying energy balance, and 3) a stable
isotope gas analyzer for the measurement of 13C and 18O in exhaled breath for precise assessments of
substrate oxidation from exogenously- or endogenously-labeled sources. Together, these new capabilities will
allow the NORC to further expand its research base and support novel science endeavors that are currently
not possible, thereby generating new insights into the pathogenesis of obesity and related metabolic disorders."

In this renewal of the Educating Physician Scientists in Psychiatry (EPSP) program at the University of
Pennsylvania (Penn), we aim to build on our successes in intensively recruiting, mentoring, and training
physician scientists in psychiatry (PSPs) beginning early in clinical residency to facilitate rapid, successful career
progression. Penn EPSP will capitalize on the rich scientific environment at Penn to train outstanding and diverse
PSPs. Our goal is to recruit medical graduates with demonstrated research experience and commitment into
careers in psychiatric and neuroscience research. EPSP will be guided by three principles: the centrality of
mentorship to research success, the critical need to recruit the best trainees with attention to diversity, and the
importance of training that is both rigorous and ethical. EPSP provides increasing protected research time during
residency training starting with 10% time in year 1, culminating in 70-80% in the 4th and final year. Simultaneously,
EPSP provides time for formal research education, with intensive focus on research methodologies, career
development, and grant proposal development and writing. Trainees have the opportunity to obtain pilot funding,
providing the ultimate hands-on experience, from research design to data collection, and to analysis and
preparation for publication or presentation. Key EPSP objectives are to intensively mentor PSPs as they embark
on integrated research and clinical training; enhance the diversity of PSPs and the scientific mentors committed
to their development; and prepare PSPs for launching as independent investigators. Importantly, EPSP’s
emphasis on the primacy of mentoring in the success of young physician scientists means that the MPIs will
have significant mentoring time with the trainees to closely monitor progress and track the mentor-mentee
relationship. Innovative hallmarks of the proposed renewed EPSP will include integration of clinical neuroscientist
career development training across Penn Psychiatry and Neurology; strengthened alliances with other Penn
schools/institutions to generate multi-disciplinary research opportunities for trainees; a new Grant Proposal
Success program to maximize competitiveness for NIH K Awards and other extramural research grants;
expansion of PSP pipeline diversity through national recruitment and partnerships with Historically Black
Colleges and Universities; increased availability of diverse mentors; and leveraging the unique demographic
landscape of Philadelphia to create clinical and research experiences for PSPs that reflect the diversity of our
community and those underserved by research and clinical care. Having garnered intensive research experience
under attentive mentoring, trainees will be prepared to tackle the complex scientific challenges facing psychiatry."

We are requesting funds for the purchase of a timsTOF HT mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid
chromatography system (Bruker) to be used for qualitative and quantitative proteomic analyses. This
instrument will greatly expand the proteomic capabilities of the University of Rochester Mass Spectrometry
Resource Laboratory (MSRL) and the services it offers to its user-base throughout the University of Rochester
and Western New York. Currently, the existing MS instruments at the MSRL are being used at full capacity
and there is a critical need for additional modernized instrumentation to alleviate project backlogs and take
advantage of recent advances in label-free Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) proteomics. The acquisition
of the timsTOF will augment our aging “3D” mass spectrometer (capable of detection of ions based LC
retention time, mass to charge and MS/MS fingerprint) with a “4D” ion mobility platform capable of additional
separation based on collision cross-section (CCS) properties of ions.
Recent advances in mass spectrometry have provided powerful tools for high-throughput analysis of proteins
that are widely employed in medical and biological research. Proteomic analyses are typically used for
discovery applications and in clinical or analytical screens that require large-scale target detection and
quantification of complex protein mixtures. Due to its potential for high impact on existing NIH-funded research
programs and Centers, the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) has targeted proteomics as an
area of critical development. The University's commitment to developing and supporting the MSRL has been
essential for providing accessibility to modern mass spectrometry resources, services and expertise for the
University of Rochester and Western New York research communities. The facility has experienced a
dramatic increase in demand in recent years, spurred in part by an overall shortage of accessibility to high-
end mass spectrometers in the region.
The requested timsTOF HT mass spectrometer is a versatile instrument that excels at high-throughput
quantitative proteomic applications, at a level beyond the capabilities of the current mass spectrometers in
the core facility. Specifically, the timsTOF instrument offers high-capacity Trapped Ion Mobility (TIMS)
analyzer, enables Parallel Accumulation and Serial Fragmentation (PASEF) and accurate, reproducible ion
mobility separation and CCS determination. Importantly, the instrument can achieve sequencing speeds up
to 150 Hz and 60,000 (FWHM) resolution at 1222 m/z. This rate of data acquisition far exceeds our current
instrument and will enable significant enhancements in our project turnaround times. In this application, 9
major users and 4 minor users provide project descriptions that impact at least 20 NIH research grants. The
diversity of users highlights the importance of this technology and the unmet level of need that will be
addressed by the instrument.
The need for sensitive high-throughput, high-resolution mass spectrometry is rapidly growing in the Medical
Center and the College that encompass over 45 departments and research centers, and over 800 research
laboratories. To ensure the highest level of access to proteomic technology and services, the requested
instrument will be housed in the URMC Mass Spectrometry Resource Laboratory. Three dedicated core staff
members will run the instrument, and the core staff and core director will manage projects, provide consulting,
analyze data, and assist users with data interpretation and processing. Data storage, analysis, and processing
will be performed at the University of Rochester's Center for Integrated Research Computing (CIRC), which
manages a 144-core processor server for the facility. Institutional support and oversight will ensure that state-
of-the-art mass spectrometry services are developed and accessible to the research community."
10848754,"Entering its 40th year, the overarching goal of the Penn Dermatology Research T32 Training Program is to
recruit diverse young investigators into biomedical research careers pertaining to the skin and its diseases, and
to provide them the training, mentorship, and skills to be successful in that career. Training and supporting the
developing careers of the next generation of investigators in dermatology research is critical to research
progess and innovation in cutaneous biology, skin diseases, and dermatoepidemiology, leading to novel
treatments for skin disease and improvements in overall human health. To most effectively support trainees in
dermatology research, we have developed approaches to: 1) recruit diverse trainees at early stages in their
careers by exposure to the excitement and impact of dermatology research; 2) support the research and
training of young scientists with established interests in the skin and its diseases; and 3) provide a rigorous and
supportive training environment that fosters development of skin investigators across disciplines. To these
ends we request support for: 2 long-term predoctoral fellowships to support the thesis research of MD PhD
students, PhD students, or MD students pursuing a Masters in Clinical Epidemiology (MSCE) degree; and 4
postdoctoral fellowships for MD, PhD, and MD PhD scientists. A particular emphasis of our training program is
to recruit and train physician scientists through a four-year dermatology research residency track. Our program
involves 36 highly qualified trainers with expertise ranging from clinical epidemiology, genomics, medical
informatics, microbiology, immunology, to developmental biology, stem cells, skin appendages, and
regeneration. Training activities are tailored to the stages of training and the type of research conducted by the
trainee. Trainees attend and present their research at a weekly Dermatology Research Seminar, a bi-weekly
Trainee Power Hour, and an annual Scientific Symposium & Trainee Retreat. Trainees receive formal
instruction in the responsible conduct of research, methods to enhance scientific rigor and reproducibility,
biostatical and analytical approaches, data sharing, and other appropriate data science training tailored to the
trainee’s individual needs. Skills workshops are conducted to develop grant writing and manuscript drafting
skills. These activites complement a rich set of professional and career development activites facilitated by
Penn’s post-doctoral and graduate programs. The training program is evaluated by conducting annual trainee
surveys, by an external advisory committee that meets yearly, assessment of research output (publications,
grants, awards), and tracking long-term career outcomes including leadership positions in academia and
industry. These approaches have been highly successful, resulting in diverse, rigorously-trained independent
investigators that go on to become academic leaders and independent scientists across the disciplines of
dermatology research. Continued support of this Training Program will fuel new mechanistic understanding
and therapeutic targets for skin disease, and improved health and quality of life for dermatology patients."

 Cancer is a highly heterogenous disease, composed of and characterized by a diverse set of genetic
phenotypes driven by complex dynamic cellular interactions within spatially distinct organized
microenvironments. The ability to accurately delineate this intra tumor heterogeneity and its contribution to
metastasis, therapeutic resistance and ultimately the impact of clinical outcomes, remains a challenge. In
addition, the molecular mechanisms underpinning the cross-talk between tumor and its microenvironment are
largely lacking.
 This prostate cancer Program Project sets out to investigate the tumor cell intrinsic as well as stromal
and immune microenvironmental factors in tumor progression using single cell sequencing technologies.
Additionally, the Program will incorporate a multi-disciplinary and integratory approach that aims to integrate
single-cell RNA-sequencing and systems analyses of genetically engineered mouse and organoid models, with
complementary analyses of human tissue samples in naïve, castration-resistant and neuroendocrine tumors,
both local and metastatic.
 The Pathobiology Core (Core A) will support the projects by providing expert histopathologic analysis of
murine and human tumors, validating antibodies and probes for use in mouse and human tissue, comparing and
contrasting multiple signals in epithelium and microenvironment in mouse models and patient samples.
Innovative approaches including organotypic cultures and recombination experiments will be utilized as
functional assays. Finally, refining strategies in computational methods to compare single cell analyses in human
and mouse as well as developing novel approaches to improve and automate in situ expression modalities will
represent the innovation arm of this core."
10852876,"Abstract: When prostate cancer (PCa) cells localize in bone they encounter osteal macrophages in the
marrow/tumor microenvironment. The specific function of macrophages in apoptotic cancer cell clearance, a
process termed efferocytosis, leads to a pro-inflammatory immunosuppressive cascade that supports further
tumor growth. Findings from the project laboratory in the previous cycle support a strategy to allow apoptotic
cell engulfment to occur in a robust and resolving manner while reducing the adverse signaling and hence
reorienting the macrophage program that occurs when they engulf a cancer cell. It is critical to identify the
specific mediators responsible for the pro-inflammatory immunosuppressive response and selectively target
them while promoting efferocytosis and resolution. An efferocytic recognition signal, T cell immunoglobulin and
mucin-domain containing-3 (Tim-3) has been identified as a strong candidate in the recognition of
phosphatidylserine on an apoptotic cell and the downstream deleterious signaling operative in tumor
associated macrophages. The overall hypothesis is that macrophage efferocytosis of apoptotic prostate
cancer cells triggers immunosuppressive signaling which supports cancer growth in bone that can be
targeted as a novel cancer therapy. Three aims include; 1) To determine the role of efferocytosis-induced
Tim-3 in macrophages and its ability to accelerate tumor growth in bone, 2) To elucidate targetable
mechanisms of the signaling pathways triggered by efferocytosis of prostate cancer cells that support
immunosuppression and tumor growth in bone, and 3) To identify the specific gene-expression signature of
bone marrow efferocytic monocytes/macrophages during skeletal metastasis. Strategies for this project will
include meticulous targeting of the efferocytic receptor Tim-3 with selective antibodies and a gene targeted
mouse model, single cell RNA-seq analyses of the unique transcriptional profile of efferocytic tumor associated
macrophages, and dysregulation of the signaling pathway for Tim-3 with known and synthesized biochemical
targets. Interactions with the other PO1 projects will leverage osteocytic derived factors, abscisic acid, and the
polyploid status of cancer cells to identify their roles in the tumor microenvironment that macrophages
orchestrate to lead to catastrophic tumor growth. Efferocytic macrophages provide gatekeeping activities in the
tumor microenvironment that are particularly relevant in the skeletal metastatic lesion. Targeting the signaling
of efferocytic macrophages in the bone marrow provides a new avenue that will benefit the design of patient
therapeutics for the treatment of prostate cancer skeletal metastasis."

10853041,"Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are aggressive tumors that are a major cause of morbidity and mortality
in the United States. In the past decade, the introduction of systemic therapies such as receptor tyrosine
kinase targeted inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors have significantly improved patient outcomes.
However, therapeutic resistance to these therapies frequently develops and is characterized by parallel
signaling through other co-expressed receptor glycoproteins. We have therefore investigated the feasibility of
disrupting asparagine (N) linked glycosylation, a co- and post-translational protein modification, as a strategy
to block both primary and bypass glycoprotein survival signaling in NSCLC. Although this pathway is target
rich and involves at least 34 gene products, pharmacologic inhibitors that regulate this process have not
previously been available. We have identified a first in class small molecule inhibitor of the
oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), the multi-subunit enzymatic complex that transfers glycans to elongating
proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. This inhibitor reduces OST fidelity by targeting the catalytic subunit and
results in a site-specific and partial inhibition of glycosylation. In NSCLC with activation of RTK dependent
oncogenic signaling, OST inhibition blocks tumor cell proliferation and couples favorably with TKIs to enhance
apoptosis and xenograft tumor growth. We now propose to characterize and advance novel small molecule
inhibitors of the OST with respect to catalytic subunit inhibition and effects on EGFR driven NSCLC. Because
glycoprotein bypass signaling is also operative in NSCLC subtypes with FGFR1 amplification or KRAS
mutation, we will define the signaling mechanisms and determine the sensitivity of these tumors to OST
inhibition. This project will also investigate the effects of OST inhibition on NSCLC radiosensitivity and identify
how glycoprotein dependent cellular programs mediate intrinsic and immune mediated therapeutic resistance.
Together this work will advance OST inhibition as a novel treatment strategy for NSCLC with the potential of
delivering an OST inhibitor that can be translated to the clinic."

This proposal reflects the renewal of an NIAAA-funded alcohol training program at the Alcohol Research
Group (ARG) in operation since 1971, which has provided 279 fellows with training and support. The main
goal is to continue to support a program designed to prepare trainees for a path of active research in
alcohol studies. This will be accomplished by offering applicants with backgrounds in public health,
epidemiology, psychology, sociology, social welfare, economics, and related professional disciplines the
opportunity to carry out their own research and grant-writing with the support of a collegial and highly
interactive environment of researchers and faculty actively working in the alcohol field. The Director of
Training is Dr. William Kerr, a Senior Scientist at ARG and Director of NIAAA National Alcohol Research
Center Epidemiology of Alcohol Problems: Alcohol-Related Disparities. Our program focuses primarily
on training in the incidence, prevalence, and etiology of alcohol use, use disorders and related
problems and secondarily on alcohol-related health services and alcohol policy research. The
program particularly emphasizes training in health disparities related to these areas. Fellows learn
from an intensive period of residence and involvement in the research environment and activities of the
Alcohol Research Group and its long-standing NIAAA National Alcohol Research Center. ARG's research
foci reflect the Program aims and include the social epidemiology of alcohol problems and alcohol-
related health services and policy research, with a strong emphasis on documenting and explaining
racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, gender, and sexual orientation disparities. Fellows also benefit from
participation in mentorship, research, and training opportunities at the School of Public Health at UC
Berkeley, where the program resides and at collaborating institutions UCSF, UCLA and San Jose State
University. Three postdoctoral and three predoctoral fellows are supported by the program annually,
with most in residence for two years. Predoctoral fellows complete a dissertation on an alcohol-related
topic, while postdoctoral fellows publish papers, conduct new research, and submit NIAAA grant

10853062,"Optogenetics has primarily employed light gated ion channels (derived from lower organisms) to trigger or inhibit
the neuronal action potential. Analogous studies in the cardiovascular field have used these photoresponsive
foreign proteins to regulate contractility and pacing. However, light gated ion channels are unable to interrogate
the intracellular mechanisms that control behavior and homeostasis. As a consequence, we have developed a
protein engineering strategy for creating light responsive analogs of endogenous proteins. The proposed
research program is focused on the design, construction, and validation of optogenetic signaling for proteins that
contribute to myocardial homeostasis, and the application of this technology to unravel the mechanisms that
drive cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Aim 1: Optogenetic Engineering to Access the Biochemical
Pathways of Hypertrophy and Fibrosis. We will employ a novel optogenetic engineering strategy to create
light responsive signaling cascades localized at specific intracellular sites, with a focus on cAMP-mediated
signaling pathways. Aim 2: Light Guided Mapping of the Signaling Domains that Mediate Hypertrophy. The
optogenetic constructs outlined in Aim 1 will be used to explore the impact of signaling events at distinct
intracellular locations on cardiomyocyte behavior, with an emphasis on hypertrophic relevant responses. Aim 3:
Light Guided Mapping of the Intercellular Communication that Mediates Fibrosis. Optogenetic analogs of
endogenous proteins will be used to assess intercellular crosstalk between two distinct cardiac cell types. Light-
triggered activation of engineered signaling pathways offers the opportunity to tease apart a collaborative
signaling network that has been observed between these distinct cell populations."

The prevalence of pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections caused by Mycobacterium
abscessus complex (MABSC) and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) species is increasing worldwide and
poses a particular threat to susceptible individuals with structural or functional lung conditions such as cystic
fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchiectasis. The intrinsic recalcitrance of these
pathogens to chemotherapeutic treatments and alarming treatment failure rates place a high priority on the
development of more effective treatment approaches.
The ability of MABSC and MAC to persist intracellularly and extracellularly within granulomatous lesions in a
non-replicating state is likely to contribute to the drug tolerance of these microorganisms and to treatment failure
in chronically-infected individuals. Further compounding this problem is the ability of MABSC and MAC to form
what appears to be genetically programmed biofilms during human pulmonary infections. A common stress faced
by intra- and extracellular NTM inside activated immune cells, in avascular necrotic and caseous regions of
granulomas, and within microaggregates or biofilms is the inhibition of aerobic respiration caused by O2 depletion
or exposure to nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide. M. tuberculosis (Mtb) is known to survive this stress by
inducing a regulon of ~50 genes that drives the entry of the bacterium in a non-replicating state while adapting
its metabolism to maintain energy levels and a redox balance compatible with survival in the absence of
respiration. Accordingly, inhibitors of the regulator which controls the expression of this regulon are actively being
sought for their potential to shorten tuberculosis treatment and lower relapse rates when used in combination
with standard-of-care antibiotics.
Our recent studies indicate that the orthologous regulators of MABSC and MAC play a similar function as in Mtb.
Genetic and pharmacological disruption of this regulator in MABSC led to inhibition of biofilm formation in addition
to decreasing bacterial viability and reversing drug tolerance under hypoxia. Most importantly, two inhibitors of
this regulator in MABSC which we identified showed significant bactericidal activity in MABSC-infected mice in
addition to potentiating the activity of standard-of-care antibiotics used in combination. Since these two inhibitors
are either clinically-used or in phase II clinical trial, they offer repurposing opportunities that could be a short
route to the clinic.
These exciting findings stimulated the submission of this grant application in which we propose to thoroughly
decipher the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic and adjunct therapeutic benefits of these inhibitors in
MABSC (Aim 1) and to determine whether the same therapeutic strategy may be applied to MAC (Aim 2)."
10852858,"Abstract
The long term objectives of this project are to explain the basis for the complex genotype-phenotype
relationships for a growing number of severe calcium channel gene disorders and develop therapies based on
these new insights. To make these advances we will capitalize on our new discovery that at least three of
these calcium channel genes are bicistronic i.e. they encode two distinct proteins, the calcium channel proteins
and a newly discovered transcription factor. We have discovered that the transcription factor is translated by
internal translation by a process resembling an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). We hypothesize that
mutations in these Ca2+ channel genes may have a diversity of outcomes, affecting, in distinct cases,
neuronal firing, calcium signaling, regulation of the expression of the transcription factor or directly altering the
function of the transcription factor. In this study we will systematically explore the function and biological
action of these three novel transcription factors, how their expression is regulated by the IRES, how normal
cellular physiology governs their translocation to and from the nucleus, and how different mutations affecting
channel gating, IRES function and transcription factor cause impaired neuronal development and or viability in
these different disorders. We will study this using recombinant calcium channels expressed in primary neurons
and human reprogrammed neurons from normal and patient sources, and in transgenic mice expressing well
characterized mutations. We will study gene binding and expression using next generation approaches,
nuclear translocation using epitope and fluorescent tags with physiological stimuli, IRES function using dual
luciferase reporters and immunoblotting, neuronal development using immunofluorescent microscopy and
corrective therapy using antisense oligos, miRNA and AAV viral vectors expressing transcription factors."
10852964,"Neural circuits are formed by directed growth of axons and dendrites and subsequent assembly of synapses
between selected pre- and postsynaptic neurons at precise anatomical and subcellular locations. Although
tremendous progress has been made in identifying the key axon guidance cues for nervous system development
in the past two decades, the signaling and cell biological mechanisms of axon guidance still remain partially
understood. The incomplete knowledge of how growth cones signal to respond to specific cues hinders our ability
to apply the knowledge from axon guidance studies to repair circuits and restore function after traumatic injury
and in neurodegenerative disorders. We found that Wnt family morphogens are axon guidance cues and the
planar cell polarity pathway mediates Wnt function in axon guidance. We also found that Wnt signaling regulate
axon regrow after spinal cord injury in adulthood and planar cell polarity signaling regulates the assembly of
glutamatergic synapse formation. We plan to use Wnt/PCP signaling as a tool to address unsolved fundamental
questions in growth cone guidance and understand its expanded role in adult axon regeneration. Aim 1: How
PCP components create asymmetric signaling to mediate growth cone turning in development. Aim 2:
Interactions between Wnt/PCP pathway and canonical Wnt pathway and the Shh pathway in A-P guidance. Aim
3: Role of Wnt/PCP signaling in functional recovery after spinal cord injury."
10850427,"ABSTRACT
 Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are seen in ~70% of individuals with 1p36 deletion syndrome and are a
major cause of morbidity and mortality. RERE and SPEN are nuclear receptor coregulator encoding genes
located in CHD critical regions on chromosome 1p36. We have shown that their haploinsufficiencies contribute
to the development of 1p36-related CHD and individually cause syndromic forms of CHD with ventricular septal
defects (VSDs) being particularly common. In this application, we will elucidate the morphogenetic and
molecular mechanisms by which RERE and SPEN function during cardiac development.
 Using our unique mouse resources, we have shown that systemic or endocardial-specific RERE deficiency
causes endocardial cushion hypoplasia and VSDs by decreasing levels of endothelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EndMT) and mesenchymal cell proliferation in the atrioventricular (AV) canal. Our published and
preliminary data suggest that RERE functions in the AV canal by positively regulating the expression of Spen,
Gata4, Bmp6, and Bmp7, all of which have been implicated in the development of VSDs. Similarly, we have
shown that systemic or endocardial-specific SPEN deficiency causes endocardial cushion hypoplasia and
VSDs, and that Rere and Spen interact genetically in VSD formation. These results lead us to hypothesize that
SPEN deficiency triggers morphogenetic changes in the developing AV canal that are similar to those caused
by RERE deficiency. Since SPEN and RERE encode nuclear receptor coregulators and interact with similar
proteins including RARα and HDAC1, we also hypothesize that they function within the same pathway to
regulate Gata4, Bmp6, and Bmp7 transcription in the developing AV canal. To test these hypotheses, we
propose two Specific Aims.
 In Specific Aim #1, we will determine the morphogenic mechanisms by which SPEN deficiency
causes VSDs using AV canal explant and immunohistochemical studies. Specifically, we will determine if
SPEN deficiency leads to decreased levels of EndMT and mesenchymal cell proliferation, and if it also triggers
increased levels of mesenchymal cell death not seen in RERE deficient embryos. In Specific Aim #2, we will
determine the molecular mechanisms by which SPEN deficiency causes VSDs and how RERE and
SPEN interact using a variety of molecular techniques. Specifically, we will determine if SPEN functions
similarly to RERE in regulating the expression of Gata4, Bmp6, and Bmp7, if RERE can activate the SPEN
promoter, and if RERE and SPEN interact in a complex to drive the transcription of their target genes.
 The knowledge gained from these experiments will serve as a foundation from which therapeutic and
preventative interventions can be developed, not only for individuals with 1p36 deletions or pathogenic variants
in RERE and SPEN, but also for a much larger group of individuals at risk for VSDs. The innovative mouse
models used in this proposal will provide a platform on which these interventions can be tested."
10850145,"ABSTRACT
Assembly of the brain relies upon spatiotemporally coordinated action of a small number of intracellular
signaling pathways, which together govern an astonishingly wide array of processes, ranging from cell
differentiation to tissue morphogenesis. How a handful of pathways can provide the precision and specificity
required for the emergence of complex tissue structure and function that unfold over long periods of time, such
as those of the human brain, has been a long-standing question in developmental biology. Even though landmark
studies in developmental genetics, biochemistry and synthetic biology over the last decades have uncovered the
working mechanisms of many signaling pathways and downstream genetic circuits, a major challenge that
remains is to decipher how cells integrate information transmitted through the concerted action of several
signaling factors which then drive region-specific morphogenetic processes in developmentally relevant contexts.
Moreover, although the key components of these pathways are highly conserved across species, how they are
functionally implemented to enable uniquely complex stratification of regions and cell types during brain
development remains unknown, due to lack of functional access to primary tissue, appropriate models and
molecular tools. To address this challenge, here we propose a spatiotemporally resolved approach that interfaces
the dynamics of multiple signaling pathways over space and time in physiologically relevant systems. Specifically,
this proposal will seek to combine several state-of-art techniques (DNA memory devices, multiplex biosensor
imaging, spatial transcriptomics and pooled CRISPR screens) with human induced pluripotent stem cell
(hiPSC)-derived organoid models, primary human neural progenitors and fetal marmoset brain sections to chart
the cell signaling atlas for the developing brain at a resolution that has not previously been accessible. In Aim 1,
we will implement in hiPSC lines DNA Typewriter and ENGRAM (DT/E), which together enable prime editing-
mediated, temporally ordered insertion of signal-specific barcodes onto the genome to deconvolve the history of
signaling dynamics of single cells and correlate them with their cellular and regional identities in unguided
human brain organoids. In Aim 2, we will use optically barcoded biosensor imaging to assess the differential
recruitment of morphogen-coupled signaling effectors. In Aim 3, using spatial transcriptomics, we will
investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics between core developmental signaling and mechanotransduction
pathways in specific fetal marmoset brain regions. Then, using 3D printing and pooled CRISPR engineering, we
will assess how perturbed mechanotransduction affects regional specification programs in human brain
organoids in response to varying degrees of biomechanical challenge. Ultimately, this proposal is designed to
have a broad impact on multiple areas of scientific research across basic and translational developmental
neurobiology and provide transformative new ways to better understand the signaling landscape underlying
brain assembly in health and disease."
10850229,"Project Summary:
Our understanding of fundamental cell biological processes is both driven by and limited by our ability to
visualize the organization of structures and molecules within cells and tissues. The development of super-
resolution fluorescence imaging methods that circumvent the resolution limits of conventional light microscopy,
achieving lateral resolution of <100 nm, have transformed cell biological research. Access to super-resolution
fluorescence imaging technology is now essential for scientists wishing to push the frontiers of cell biological
research. This proposal requests funds to replace Stanford University’s Cell Sciences Imaging Facility’s
11-year-old, obsolete OMX structured illumination, super resolution microscope with an Elyra 7 lattice-
SIM2 super-resolution imaging system (Zeiss, Inc.). This state-of-the-art, super-resolution microscope can
achieve both lateral and axial resolution at greater than twice the diffraction limit of conventional light
microscopy and is capable of multichannel super-resolution far beyond the cover glass. The fast-imaging
capability of Elyra 7 lattice SIM2 is also designed to overcome speed limitations enabling 3D live-cell super
resolution imaging. This advanced imaging system will be a shared resource, located in a well-established,
multi-user microscopy facility at Stanford: The Cell Sciences Imaging Facility. The requested Elyra 7 lattice
SIM2 imaging system will support research projects from eight researchers, all of which are NIH funded. These
projects investigate a wide range of topics, including: meiotic chromosome segregation and genetic
recombination (Villeneuve); signaling and vesicular transport in primary cilia (Jackson), molecular mechanisms
of myelin wrapping in neurons (Zuchero); maintenance and regulation of genomic stability (Cimprich and
Chistol), spatial organization of cell-cell junctions (Dunn); the role of the extra cellular matrix in cell invasion
and migration (Chaudhuri); and the role human calcineurin signaling pathways in cellular processes (Cyert).
These studies investigate critical functional and structural questions regarding fundamental cell biological
processes and cover NIH research areas with implications for diverse aspects of human health and disease,
including cancer, birth defects, obesity, immunity, as well as neurodegenerative disease. All these projects
require multi-channel super-resolution imaging and simultaneous multi-channel fast imaging; this combination
of capabilities is most effectively provided by the requested Elyra 7 lattice SIM2 instrument."
10850305,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is an aggressive malignancy derived from stratified
squamous epithelium of the oral cavity. Leukoplakia is a premalignant condition and is recognized as the
precursor lesion of HNSCC. During leukoplakia-associated neoplastic evolution, benign squamous epithelium
first becomes dysplasia, then carcinoma in situ, and finally progresses to invasive SCC. Therefore, leukoplakia
serves as an ideal premalignant model for the investigation of the step-wise neoplastic evolution of oral
squamous epithelial cells. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms promoting leukoplakia-
associated neoplasia remains quite limited. This shortcoming is largely due to viable and valid human models
representing this unique pathological transition have been lacking. To address this key challenge, we have
developed two independent, cross-species organoid systems modeling the step-wise neoplastic evolution of
HNSCC.
Both metabolic reprogramming and epigenomic deregulation are cancer hallmarks. Here we have mapped a
key mechanistic crosstalk between the methionine cycle and epigenomic reprogramming, through a novel
cascade involving LAT1-methionine-EZH2. Specifically, we find that HNSCC exhibits the highest activity of this
cascade among all human cancers. High LAT1 expression correlates with poor survival of HNSCC patients.
Importantly, this cascade is indispensable for the survival and proliferation of HNSCC cells, representing a
tumor-specific vulnerability. Notably, this novel LAT1-methionine-EZH2 cascade can be targeted by either
pharmacological approaches or dietary intervention. These interesting and significant findings prompt us to
hypothesize that the novel LAT1-methionine-EZH2 cascade functionally promotes both early precursor
transformation and cancer development, representing a prominent actionable target for cancer prevention and
treatment.
To test this hypothesis, we will leverage our versatile premalignant and tumor organoid systems as well as
animal models, to investigate the biological significance of the LAT1-methionine-EZH2 cascade during both the
initial steps of oral neoplastic transformation and fully-established HNSCC tumors. We will establish the
molecular basis of this pathway using advanced metabolomic profiling and epigenomic approaches such as
Cut&Tag. We will perform preclinical evaluation of pharmacological and dietary blockade of this cascade, to
rigorously assess both tumor-prevention and tumor-killing effect of candidate approaches. We will further
develop LAT1-high vs LAT1-low organoid models to investigate whether LAT1 serves as a biomarker to predict
cellular dependence on the LAT1-methionine-EZH2 axis. This study not only investigates fundamental cancer
biology, but also has significant translational implications for both early intervention and treatment of HNSCC."
10850013,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Our 24-hour society requires an increasing number of individuals to work rotating shifts to adapt to schedules
on a global scale. In the United States, 15 million people participate in some form of shift work. Shift work is
associated with the risk of cardiovascular health problems including increased blood pressure (BP), decreased
heart rate variability (HRV), ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Previous research revealed
that shift work induces a misalignment between the endogenous circadian system and the sleep/wake cycle, a
phenomenon known as circadian misalignment. Despite the relationship between circadian misalignment and
reduced cardiovascular health, there are limited studies on the biological mechanisms responsible for the
development of these problems.
The nucleus of the solitary tract (nTS) is the first central integration site of peripheral afferents and reflexes.
Alterations of the balance within the nTS, of synaptic and/or neuronal excitation, results in elevations in blood
pressure. Astrocytes are closely associated with nTS synapses and together with the presynaptic terminal and
nTS neuron, form the “tripartite synapse”. In the nTS, astrocytes contribute to synaptic and neuronal activity
and their plasticity, as well as pH regulation. The extracellular concentration of glutamate, the primary
excitatory neurotransmitter in the nTS, is maintained by astrocytic excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs).
These transporters are critical in maintaining the balance of inhibition and excitation in the nTS via uptake of
their respective neurotransmitters. In our preliminary work, we demonstrated that the animal model of circadian
misalignment leads to elevated BP and HRV and that these changes were accompanied by decreases in nTS
glutamatergic activity. Therefore, in this project, we ask: what is the role of nTS astrocytes in glutamate
modulation in the nTS following circadian misalignment and does this pathway contribute to increased BP?
Answering this question would address a critical need in our understanding of neural control of blood pressure
in response to circadian misalignment.
Based on our preliminary data and previous work, we hypothesize that circadian misalignment perturbs the
balance of the glutamatergic system in the nTS through disruption of EAATs on astrocytes, leading to an
increase in blood pressure. This hypothesis will be tested using an established rodent model of circadian
misalignment, which has already been set up in our laboratory. We propose the following aims: Aim 1:
Determine astrocytic morphology and expression of EAATs in circadian control of blood pressure. Does
circadian misalignment alter this astrocytic morphology and/or EAAT expression? Aim 2. Define the extent to
which nTS astrocyte function, specifically EAATs, contribute to nTS circadian regulation of blood pressure and
how circadian misalignment alters their activity."
10852789,"Targeting post-translational modifications of B7-H4 in carcinogenesis and therapy
The goal of this project is to determine the impact of interplay between glycosylation and ubiquitination of B7-H4
in breast carcinogenesis and anti-breast cancer therapy. B7-H4, also known as V-set domain containing T cell
activation inhibitor 1 (VTCN1), acts as an immune checkpoint protein whose local abnormal accumulation is
correlated with poor prognosis of various types of cancers including triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). While
a current TCGA study suggests the critical role of B7-H4 in conferring tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs
and immune checkpoint inhibitors, how B7-H4 is regulated and how its deregulation contributes to breast
carcinogenesis and tumor drug response remain unknown. Results from our recent purification of the B7-H4
protein complex revealed that 2 critical enzymes, AMFR and STT3 complex, tightly interact with and regulate
B7-H7. While the E3 ubiquitin ligase AMFR catalyzes ubiquitination of B7-H4 followed by degradation, we
observed that glycosylation of B7-H4 protein by the STT3 complex (a glycosyltransferase) results in the
stabilization of B7-H4 and inhibition of doxorubicin-induced immunogenic cell death (ICD). Elevation of B7-H4
levels due to enhanced B7-H4 glycosylation counteracts B7-H4 ubiquitination, which in turn suppresses
endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated phagocytosis in response to chemotherapy drugs, a critical step in
triggering mass tumor eradication by ICD. We further demonstrated that blockade of B7-H4 glycosylation by
NGI-1, a novel protein glycosylation inhibitor, significantly enhances B7-H4 ubiquitination and subsequent
degradation, resulting in promotion of tumor killing efficacy due to increased phagocytosis by dendritic cells and
their capacity to elicit CD8+ interferon-γ-producing T cell responses. In this project, we plan to test the
hypothesis that deregulation of B7-H4 by the crosstalk between glycosylation and ubiquitination promotes
TNBC tumor evasion from chemotherapy and blockade of B7-H4 glycosylation by NGI-1 could be a new strategy
for anti-TNBC treatment. We propose the following specific aims to pursue this goal: (1) to determine the
mechanism by which interplay between glycosylation and ubiquitination regulates B7-H4-orchestrated
phagocytosis; (2) to determine the physiological relevance of STT3-mediated glycosylation and AMFR-facilitated
ubiquitination in B7-H4-mediated ICD in response to chemotherapy drugs; and (3) to determine the clinical
relevance of blockade of B7-H4 glycosylation by NGI-1 in anti-TNBC treatment using various preclinical murine
models."
10844733,"ABSTRACT
 Adhesion G-Protein Coupled-Receptors (aGPCR) represent a particularly interesting class of receptors in the
understudied druggable genome that could be therapeutic targets for pain control. These receptors possess
tethered peptide agonists on the N-terminus of the proteins that are exposed by autoproteolysis (Stachel
sequence). After proteolysis the receptor remains active until it is degraded, which could chronically maintain
pain. The Eligible Protein List contains 27 aGPCRs. In our recent transcriptomic analysis of mouse trigeminal
ganglia (TG) we found that 23 of these proteins are expressed in TG, yet only ADGRD1 (UniProt# Q6QNK2)
was reported to be altered by infraorbital nerve chronic constriction injury (ION-CCI). ADGRD1’s Stachel
sequence is highly selective for the receptor suggesting that the binding site is discriminative and that selective
ligands could be designed to interact with the protein, the receptor activates Gαs to stimulate cAMP production,
and the receptor is expressed at similar levels in mouse, rat, and human TG indicating that it should be
translatable. These data suggest that ADGRD1 maybe an exceptional candidate for analgesic development.
However, to date ADGRD1 has not been examined as a potential mediator of pain. This project will address the
following questions to establish the function of ADGRD1 in ION-CCI induced chronic allodynia. 1) What sensory
neurons express ADGRD1? This aim will utilize transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry to identify the cell
types in the TG and trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (TNC) that express ADGRD1 in naïve and ION-CCI mice.
These experiments will also evaluate the relationship between the development of ION-CCI mechanical allodynia
and protein expression. 2) Can ADGRD1 be activated by its Stachel peptide when applied exogenously? The
presence of the receptor in TG in naïve mice suggests that administering the Stachel peptide to the animals
could induce facial mechanical allodynia, which would confirm a role for the protein in nociception. 3) Can ION-
CCI induced mechanical allodynia be suppressed by a targeted botulinum toxin light chain that uses the Stachel
peptide as a targeting sequence? This aim will take advantage of our previous experience in the development
of neuropeptide – toxin conjugates to either lesion or alter the function of nociceptive neurons. A botulinum A
light chain conjugate with the ADGRD1 Stachel peptide (Stach-Bot) will be constructed and tested for its ability
to block ION-CCI induced mechanical allodynia in mice. These experiments would confirm that the neurons
expressing ADGRD1 are nociceptive and that they participate in mechanical allodynia. The data collected in
this project will establish the cell types that express ADGRD1, determine if the protein can produce
allodynia when activated, and demonstrate that the neurons that express ADGRD1 participate in ION-
CCI induced allodynia. These results would provide the impetus for future studies that develop novel
therapeutics targeting ADGRD1 for use in treating neuropathic pain."

U-RISE at Sacramento State is a continuation of the Sacramento State RISE program designed to
deliver a rich research-training curriculum to increase the number of students from
underrepresented and marginalized groups who enter doctoral degrees in biomedical research.
Since its inception in 2017, Sacramento State RISE trained 32 unduplicated students, where 29
are pursuing biomedical research graduate studies: 15 pursued biomedical PhD programs, 9
pursued biomedical Master’s programs, and 5 work in biotechnology companies.
The proposed U-RISE at Sacramento State aims to develop a diverse and competitive pool of

with disabilities, and first-generation and low-income individuals, who have the talent and desire
to earn doctoral degrees in biomedical research.
U-RISE at Sacramento State will annually serve 8 Trainees selected from the College of Natural
Sciences and Mathematics by offering a rich research training curriculum, graduate school
preparedness workshops, individualized graduate school readiness advising, and preparing
competitive applications for doctoral programs. By the end of the program, Trainees will (1)
develop a firm understanding of the principles of responsible conduct of research; (2) have a
supportive, inclusive experience in a research setting to understand the skills of designing,
conducting and presenting rigorous research, and (3) build their identity as a biomedical

10851428,"Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) is an endogenous pathogen, strongly implicated in the etiology of adult
periodontal disease. This research will increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control
synthesis of Pg’s capsule and membrane lipids. Our overarching model is that the biofilm state acts as a
reservoir of bacteria, while capsule synthesis is linked to a transition to virulence and disruption of
homeostasis. We have shown that DNABII family members in Pg (HU PG0121 and HU PG1258) are
involved in controlling production of capsule. In general, DNABII proteins are known to be critical for
regulation of cell metabolism, the response to environmental perturbations, and in controlling the transition to
and from a quiescent state. Central to our studies is an antisense RNA (asSuGR, for antisense Surface
Glycan Regulator) encoded at the 5’-end of the capsule locus (PG0104-PG0121) within a novel 77bp
inverted repeat (77bpIR) element. Deletion or over- expression of asSuGR alters the synthesis of both K-
antigen capsule and LPS, and expression is, in part, controlled by the two-component response regulator
PG0720. In addition, we have determined that synthesis of a certain subset of sphingolipids is required for
the presentation of K-antigen capsule on the cell surface, and this finding aligns with our discovery of a
matching asSuGR target sequence in a sphingolipid-synthesis locus (PG1780-PG1788). Our working model
is that genes involved in K- antigen capsule and SL-synthesis are coordinately regulated by asSuGR. In
these studies, we will determine how DNABII proteins along with other regulatory proteins and asSuGR
modulate the synthesis of capsule, LPS, and sphingolipids and we will elucidate the ligand/signal that
activates the two-component system (PG0719-PG0720). Our overall goal is to identify regulatory pathways
that control the switch from a persistent, surface-attached state to a virulent state capable of disrupting
microbe-host homeostasis. The research proposed in this application is significant because understanding
the control of surface property changes is a vital link to understanding the switch this bacterium makes to a
virulent pathogen. As an outcome of these studies, we will have characterized mechanisms that control the
synthesis of key virulence determinants. This information will lead to a better understanding of the regulatory
networks that either direct P. gingivalis to become a virulent pathogen or to continue to lie low and persist.
Our results will potentially lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for modulating biofilm
growth and persistence of this oral pathogen."

10854795,"Abstract
 Diagnosed in >187,000 persons each year, non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) has been a leading
cause of cancer-related mortality in the US. For NSCLC patients, radiation therapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy
has been used as the standard care when the disease stays at locally advanced or local regional stage. Recently,
radiotherapy have also been proven to be a viable alternative to lobectomy and lymph node dissection in stage
I NSCLC patients. Despite its wide application in NSCLC patient management, the efficacy of RT would often
be limited by the innate or acquired radioresistance. A wide range of radiosensitizers, such as cisplatin, 5-Fu,
nicotinamide, and etoposide, are often used in concurrent with RT to improve treatment outcome. Unfortunately,
these drugs could also cause severe systematic toxicities while enhancing tumor killing efficacy.
 This research proposes to develop a new category of radiosensitizer based on the ultra-small metal-
intercalated-carbon dots (named as M@Cdots), aiming to achieve enhanced cancer killing effect with minimal
systemic toxicity. Our M@Cdots have various unique features including: 1) enhanced RT therapy effects of X-
ray: the metal fillings of M@Cdots enhance photoelectric effects of X-ray, which, in conjunction with the carbon
surface catalyzed radiolysis, lead to remarkable radiosensitizing effects; 2) limited cytotoxicity: due to the bio-
inert carbon shell, M@Cdots are not susceptible to metal falloff as many conventional high-Z nanoparticles are,
and they cause little cytotoxicity in the absence of ionizing irradiation. Meanwhile, due to its ultra-small size (3nm),
M@Cdots are efficiently excreted through renal clearance with minimal reticuloendothelial system (RES) uptake,
reducing the risk of long-term toxicity to the host. 3) template synthesis methods: M@Cdots are made through
mesoporous template calcination and are 3 nm in diameter. This unique approach allows easy scale-up
synthesis of particles, and permits reliable metal encapsulation without extensively re-exploring synthetic
procedures.
 Our preliminary therapy results are very promising. On this basis, we will also explore active tumor targeting
by conjugating neurotensin (NTS) ligands to the surface of M@Cdots. The target, neurotensi receptor 1 (NTSR1),
is upregulated in large numbers of lung cancer patients but not in normal lung tissues. It is hypothesized that
with excellent tumor selectivity, efficient radiosensitization, minimal metal falloff, and efficient renal clearance,
NTS-M@Cdots will lead to greatly improved RT outcomes at the same or even reduced radiation doses while
causing minimal systemic toxicities. Although the current study is focused on NSCLC, the methodology can also
be easily extended to treatment of other cancer types, for instance head and neck, breast, and prostate cancer."

glands in a hormonal fashion, GC levels are regulated at the tissue level in a paracrine manner by conversion
enzymes such as Hsd11b1 and Hsd11b2. While the detrimental effects of exogenous pharmacological doses of
GC are well known, the roles for endogenous, adrenal-derived, physiological concentrations of GC are poorly
understood, particularly in musculoskeletal aging. Endogenous GC are known to be dysregulated in aging: in
older humans and mice, circulating GC levels increase, lose proper circadian cycling, and show amplified local
conversion to active forms via expression of enzymes like Hsd11b1 with age in bone. Given the adverse effects
of exogenous GC on the skeleton, we originally predicted that deletion of the GR would protect the skeleton from
aging-induced bone loss. However, the opposite was surprisingly true: conditional loss of GR in Osx-expressing
cells promoted low bone mass, osteoblast dysfunction, and increased bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) in
young adult mice that worsened in old mice. As a possible explanation for this finding, GC also bind to the
mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and do so with higher affinity than to GR. Our preliminary data support a
paradigm shift where accelerated skeletal aging could be occurring through aberrant MR expression or via failure
of GC bio-protective mechanisms (e.g., excessive Hsd11b1 GC activation without counterbalance from Hsd11b2
activity). Our published studies also show that conditional loss of GR in Osx-expressing cells causes systemic
changes suggestive of bone-mediated interorgan communication (IOC) in aged mice including low muscle mass,
low physical activity, and increased fat despite no loss of GR tissues outside of bone. Our preliminary data
suggest that GC-activated MR is a novel but untested mediator of bone-initiated IOC in aging evident in this
model. We have developed inducible Osx-targeted MR conditional knockout and MR overexpressing mouse
models, and an inducible Osx-targeted conditional knockout mouse model of Hsd11b1. We will leverage these
novel animal models to test the contribution of local GC activation and signaling through the MR within the
skeletal niche to mechanisms of bone aging and IOC. Our goal is to determine the molecular mechanisms and
causal role of adrenal-derived endogenous GC in the development of an aging phenotype in bone, BMAT, and
IOC with peripheral tissues like skeletal muscle and fat. We propose that disrupted IOC from abnormal bone MR
expression or activation results in accelerated tissue aging. MR inhibitors such as eplerenone are used clinically
for the regulation of blood pressure, presenting a unique opportunity for drug repurposing to improve
musculoskeletal function with age and thus address a major clinical problem. Successful completion of this
research will significantly advance understanding of fundamental pathways in the biology of musculoskeletal
aging and will identify new therapeutic targets for preventing frailty with age."

This application is for a Bruker ELEXSYS-II E500 X-band continuous wave (CW) electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) spectrometer system with temperature control to replace our failing 22-year-old Bruker
ELEXSYS E500 instrument. The new Bruker ELEXSYS-II E500 boasts 10-fold greater sensitivity, runs on a
solid-state power source, has a digital signal processing unit (SPU), and contains an ultra-low-noise microwave
source and a digital rapid field scan module. In all ways, this is a completely advanced version of our obsolete
and unreliable system. The importance of this instrument to the success of the multiple NIH-funded and future
projects is paramount, and, thus, it is imperative that we have a reliable CW EPR spectrometer. A brand-new
Bruker X-band ELEXSYS-II E500 CW EPR spectrometer will replace, and even extend, the capabilities of our
current workhorse CW spectrometer in the National Biomedical EPR Center at the Medical College of Wisconsin.
Along with increased reliability and stability, the new instrument has significantly improved sensitivity due to
modern and improved digital and solid-state parts. In addition, the requested temperature control accessory will
extend our capability to maintain accurate sample temperature in the range of 3.8–350 K. This modern
technology, which is designed primarily as a research platform for a wide variety of applications such as structural
biology, enzyme reactions, redox biology, membrane studies, drug discovery, and technology development, is
ideally suited to the specific types of NIH-funded biomedical projects outlined here for a group of 7 Major Users
and 7 Minor Users. The Bruker ELEXSYS-II E500 spectrometer is an invaluable asset that will allow us to fulfill
our NIH grant obligations and extend our collaborative scientific investigations at MCW and in the surrounding
community; it is essential to the continued excellence of our research programs."
10852356,"The goal of this project is to extend and enhance the capabilities of multiple NIH funded
researchers in the histologic preparation of undecalcified, plastic-embedded tissue samples. We
are requesting support to purchase TissueSurgeon, to our knowledge the only commercially
available laser microtomy system for preparation of histology slides from tissues containing
mineralized extracellular matrix such as bone and teeth without decalcification. This will be the
second installation of a laser microtomy system at an academic center in North America. The
equipment performs non-contact sectioning of plastic embedded hard tissues. Samples up to 40
mm in width can be processed to produce sections as thin as 10 µm. The method is suitable for
preparing samples for histology, dynamic histomorphometry, immunohistochemistry and other
applications such as Raman imaging, Fourier-transform infrared imaging, backscatter scanning
electron microscopy and nanoindentation. Laser microtomy avoids limitations of current
methods, including the frequent presence of artifacts and very slow throughput. Thus, the
instrument will enhance the health-related goals of the initial user groups which focus on bone
growth and regeneration, bone diseases and remodeling, osteoarthritis, tissue engineering and
dental reconstruction. Taking advantage of the Rush MicroCT/Histology Core, where the
instrument will be housed, there is a strong administrative plan through which the research
potential of the 7 major users with 18 NIH-funded projects and the 10 minor users with 11 NIH-
funded projects will be facilitated and enhanced. Most of the users are from Rush, but we also
have users from 5 nearby institutions including the University of Illinois at Chicago,
Northwestern University, the University of Chicago, Loyola University-Chicago and Marquette
University. The users’ funding comes from 6 NIH Institutes. Several of the users have grants
with significant training components, meaning that the research capabilities at the users’ home
institutions as well as in the field of skeletal biology in general will be enhanced. We have two
prominent experts in hard tissue histology who will serve as consultants. The Advisory
Committee includes Rush and external users. Extensive institutional support is being provided
by Rush University Medical Center. The approaches made possible by this new instrument will
significantly increase the effectiveness and extend the work of multiple NIH-funded
investigators."
10855763,"Project Summary
Saliva is essential for maintaining oral health and it has been estimated that more than 5 million people in
the US suffers from salivary gland dysfunctions. Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune
disease with unknown etiology and multiple factors have been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis
of pSS. Importantly, infiltrating immune cells (especially Th17 cells), autoantibodies producing B cells, and
dendritic cells are shown to be highly present in salivary glands of pSS patients; however, the mechanism
as why these immune cells are present in salivary tissues is not known. Although Ca2+ is shown to play a
central role in regulating saliva secretion as well as in immune cell activation, information regarding the
mechanism that modulate Ca2+ channel activity in pSS is not well understood. Endogenous metabolite,
such as lactate was previously considered as a waste product of cellular metabolism, but recently it has
been shown that these metabolites effectively modulate the immune response. L-lactate inhibit T cell
motility thereby preventing the movement of T cells, back from the inflamed tissues and increase in lactate
levels are observed in the salivary glands of pSS mouse models and in pSS patients. Importantly, increase
in lactate levels were critical in inhibiting STIM1 migration thereby preventing Ca2+ entry in salivary gland
cells that lead to a decrease in ER Ca2+ levels and induced ER stress. Lactate-mediated induction of ER
stress releases alarmins that is essential for T/B cell activation and their migration into salivary tissues.
Finally, lactate-mediated loss of Orai1 activity resulted in the overproduction of IFN and IL-17 cytokines
from CD4+ T cells and inhibited mitochondrial function that was important for metabolic reprograming
needed for T cell switching. The objective of this grant is to elucidate the mechanism(s) thereby
endogenous metabolites, such as lactate modulates Ca2+ signaling and leads to salivary gland dysfunction.
This application is based on the hypothesis that lactate induces autoimmunity by inhibiting Ca2+ entry
channels which results in decreased saliva secretion and suppression of the oxidative phosphorylation.
The results of our studies are expected to provide new insights into the role of endogenous metabolites in
regulating Ca2+ channels and the molecular mechanism involved in salivary gland dysfunction as well as
establish ways to restore functional salivary glands. Greater understanding of these events will be
important in elucidating new therapy for salivary gland dysfunctions."

A novel vaccine for Lyme disease
 Acquired resistance to Ixodes scapularis, commonly known as “tick resistance”,
can prevent transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease agent. We have
shown that tick resistance can be generated in guinea pigs (1) repeatedly exposed to I.
scapularis, (2) immunized with I. scapularis saliva, or (3) immunized with a lipid
nanoparticle containing mRNAs encoding 19 saliva proteins (19ISP). In addition,
salivary protein 14 (Salp14), a component of 19ISP, elicits partial tick resistance.
 The goal of this proposal is to identify the specific proteins in I. scapularis
saliva that elicit tick resistance and demonstrate that vaccination with these
proteins can prevent B. burgdorferi infection. We will delineate the importance of
Salp14 and additional saliva proteins in tick resistance, determine the host responses
that are associated with tick resistance, and examine whether vaccination with saliva
proteins or mRNAs encoding each saliva protein can prevent B. burgdorferi infection.
These studies will lead to new knowledge to aid in the development of a novel vaccine
which may prevent Lyme disease and, possibly, other tick-borne infections."
10840984,"The goal of this clinical informatics project is to develop computational techniques to model and analyze brain
blood vessels for detecting morphometric abnormalities that are hallmarks of cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs).
The project addresses an important challenge in neuroradiology and neurosurgery: how to accurately diagnose
CVDs on computed tomography angiography (CTA). CVDs include intracranial aneurysms, stroke, intracranial
vascular stenosis, dural fistula, and other disorders of the brain vasculature, and these diseases have severe
outcomes as they cause hemorrhage, stroke, neurological damage, and death. In fact, each year, CVDs cause
more than 100,000 deaths in the US, and an even larger population suffers permanent damage, including
stroke, paralysis, and loss of speech. If we can diagnose CVDs more accurately and promptly, mortality and
morbidity can be significantly reduced.
 Brain imaging is a first line diagnostic for CVDs with the image hallmarks being brain blood vessel
abnormalities. Yet diagnosis is very challenging because a clinician needs to sift through and zoom in and out
of and rotate a large number of images to examine each blood vessel for malformation, whether it is a
narrowing or the formation of intracranial aneurysms on blood vessel walls. Similarly, a neurosurgeon needs to
read brain scans right before an operation to locate the positions of abnormalities.
 Our specific aims of this project are to develop novel computational techniques including deep learning to
model and analyze blood vessels to detect abnormalities and highlight their locations for clinicians to examine
further. While computers are not yet sophisticated enough to make diagnoses like a trained clinician,
computers can perform more objectively and quickly, compared to human experts, the necessary complex
shape analysis and quantification, such as identifying abnormal widening or narrowing of blood vessels and
detecting protrusions on blood vessel walls. To address the request from clinicians that they would benefit
significantly from computer-aided detection of abnormalities and, once abnormalities are marked, they can
make highly accurate diagnosis and classification of the underlying CVDs, we designed an informatics
approach as a computer-aided tool to analyze CTA images. We will model both individual blood vessels and
the whole vasculature in the 3D space. Then, from the vasculature, we will develop and implement a multi-
channel deep learning model focused on shape analysis to detect blood vessel abnormalities. Finally,
abnormalities will be marked in colors in 3D to allow clinicians to make more accurate diagnoses, plan
preventative treatments, and perform precise surgeries to benefit patient health."
10840986,"The autophagic and lysosomal pathways (ALP) clear misfolded proteins and damaged organelles from cells.
Their function is therefore particularly critical for long-lived cells such as neurons. Dysfunction in the ALP is
associated with various stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This includes the robust accumulation of
autophagosomes and lysosome-like organelles in dystrophic axons around extracellular Aβ deposits (Amyloid
plaques), which are hallmark pathological features observed in human Alzheimer’s disease brain tissue and
recapitulated in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease. Amyloid plaque formation has been directly
linked to aberrant/amyloidogenic proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by secretases.
However, whether abnormal trafficking and accumulation of these organelles bearing these protein cargoes
trigger this critical pathogenic event in Alzheimer’s disease, has not been experimentally addressed. In addition,
information on mechanisms and specific molecular components regulating ALP in axons remains limited.
Elucidating these mechanisms and identifying molecular components might enable therapeutic modulation of
neuronal ALP to reduce amyloid plaque burden and toxic Aβ peptide production in Alzheimer’s disease. To this
end, our proposed research seeks to understand a) how the adaptor complex, AP-4, regulates axonal
autophagosome and lysosome biogenesis, maturation, and transport; b) how loss of AP-4 contributes to amyloid
plaque formation in vivo as well as potentially identify new AP-4 cargo that facilitate optimal retrograde axonal
lysosome transport, APOE metabolism, and synaptic activity. Central to these proposed studies is our
preliminary data that AP-4 loss causes abnormal accumulation of ALP organelles in axonal swellings reminiscent
of AD pathology, including build-up of APP cleaving proteins BACE1 and PSEN2. This and our preliminary data
demonstrating reduced AP-4 levels in AD mouse brain and an age-dependent loss of AP-4 in the pre-frontal
cortex of even wild type mice lead us to hypothesize that AP-4-dependent axonal autophagosome and lysosome
maturation and transport protects neurons from amyloidogenic APP processing and thus, from amyloid plaque
development. Additionally, our use of super-resolution microscopy on ALP organelles in axonal swellings as well
as proteomics on isolated axons and organelles upon loss of AP-4 complex, will yield novel insight into the kinds
of ALP intermediates accumulating under these pathological conditions and their relative contributions to build-
up of APP processing machinery. Our proposed efforts to dissect out AP-4 mediated axonal ALP transport and
maturation could also lead to new therapeutic opportunities that focus on mobilizing these axonal ALP organelles
to limit Aβ production and axonal pathology. Furthermore, new insights into cell biology of neuronal autophagic
and lysosomal pathways revealed by our studies could have broader relevance to other neurodegenerative
diseases that have a lysosome component to their pathology such as Parkinson’s disease, Hereditary Spastic
Paraplegia, and fronto-temporal dementia."
10840980,"Project Summary/Abstract
The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been primarily linked to defects in beta-cells, but evidence also
points to a major contribution of glucagon and alpha-cell function in this disease. Cumulative data in mouse
models and humans show that several amino acids (AAs), including branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and
aromatic amino acids, have been reported to be associated with the risk of T2D. The increase in these AAs is
associated with reduced insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and glycemia in human cohorts. Together, this
evidence suggests that elevation in BCAAs could provide a mechanistic link between obesity/insulin resistance
and beta- and alpha- cell adaptive responses. However, how AAs act on metabolically active tissues to increase
diabetes risk is not completely understood. While the metabolic coupling mechanisms of AAs on insulin and
glucagon secretion have been explored, there is a gap in understanding of how intracellular AA sensing
mechanisms control beta and alpha-cell responses induced by AAs after a meal or in insulin resistance. The
long-term goal of this project is to unravel the role of AA sensing mechanisms in beta and alpha cells in normal
and pathologic conditions. Experimental data have identified that the leucine sensor Sestrin and arginine sensor
Castor converge in the GATOR2 complex to induce Rag-dependent activation of mTORC1 signaling. Using mice
with disruption of GATOR2 complex by deletion of Wdr24 (integral component of this complex) in beta and alpha
cell demonstrates that GATOR2 plays a key role in beta and alpha cell homeostasis and regulates insulin and
glucagon secretion. This suggests that AA sensing mechanisms mediated by GATOR2 pathways in vivo are
crucial for coordinating AA responses in beta and alpha cells. The objective of this application is to build on these
observations and determine how AA sensing dependent pathways regulate beta and alpha cells in physiology
and pathological states. We hypothesize that the effects of AAs on beta and alpha cell mass and function in vivo
are mediated mainly by GATOR2. To test this hypothesis, we will determine how AA sensing mechanisms
regulate beta and alpha-cell mass and function using genetic approaches in vivo as well as ex vivo studies in
mouse and human islets. At the end of these studies we will have a better understanding of how AA availability
regulates beta and alpha cell mass and function and determine the extent to which GATOR2 functions
exclusively as a leucine and arginine sensing mechanism in vivo. These studies will also identify novel
mechanisms of adaptation to nutrient excess in states of hyperglycemia or hyper aminoacidemia. Finally, the
current work will provide better insights into how AAs and in particular BCAAs increase diabetic risk.
Understanding the molecular basis for AA sensing in beta and alpha cells will have a fundamental impact in
diabetes and provide information that can be used to expand drug development opportunities for diabetes."

This UC San Diego Womens Reproductive Health Research (WRHR) Career Development Program addresses
the urgent need to train physician-scientists in OB/GYN and Women's Health, so that they can develop into
independent leaders who will advance Women's Health. WRHR Scholars with strong prior clinical and research
experience who are committed to academic careers as physician-scientists focused on Women's Health are
selected through nationwide searches. Led by the Recruitment Officer, the Program leadership and the Diversity
Committee select the most qualified candidates for consideration by the Internal and External Advisory
Committees. Scholars are matched with primary Mentors, who are established scientists with relevant expertise
and strong mentorship experience. The Program has a team of 23 internationally recognized Mentors, with 14
in the Department of OB/GYN & Reproductive Sciences. These Mentors, along with 24 additional Collaborators,
have diverse and complementary expertise in basic, translational, and clinical research, and conduct research
in a variety of relevant areas, including impacts of social and cultural factors on Women's Health, pre- and
perinatal physiology, family planning, female pelvic medicine, reproductive endocrinology, embryology, and
gynecologic oncology. At any given time, there are projected to be 2 WRHR Scholars, who are appointed as
Assistant Professors. The Program is organized into 2 phases: in the first 1-2 years, Scholars gain research
competency; in the subsequent 3-4 years, efforts work toward research independence and academic expertise.
In Phase 1, didactic and practical instruction in epidemiology, biostatistics, data management, and informatics
supplements intensive research training, with minimal clinical work. In Phase 2, Scholars join the UCSD National
Center for Leadership in Academic Medicine program, which teaches academic development, leadership, and
organizational effectiveness and prepares the Scholar to excel as an accomplished Associate Professor.
Individualized instruction in grant writing, ethics, and medical enterprise, and quarterly workshops on career
advancement topics, are conducted by the highly experienced Leadership Team and Program Faculty. Program
faculty closely monitor the Scholars' progress. Program leadership meet with Scholars monthly and Individual
Mentorship Committees (appointed specifically for each Scholar) meet twice per year, ensuring that the research
environment and clinical demands are optimized and balanced. The Internal and External Advisory Committees
review the Scholars annually to assess their advancement and determine reappointment to the Program. The
success of the UC San Diego WRHR Program is demonstrated by the academic achievements of its past
graduates, which in include 3 who are now members of the mentorship team. The Program looks forward to
continuing to recruiting exceptional Scholars, and providing them with the rigorous training in cutting-edge
interdisciplinary research and career development support that will enable them to succeed as independent
investigators who will make critical discoveries related to Women's Health and translate them to the clinic."

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disorder characterized by insulin deficiency,
hyperglycemia and high risk for development of complications of the eyes, kidneys,
peripheral nerves, heart and blood vessels. The disease is highly prevalent,
affecting more than 30 million people in the U.S. Monitoring of glycemic control
has traditionally been considered a cornerstone of diabetes care. The importance
of monitoring glycemia has been established by studies proving a direct
relationship between mean blood glucose and the development and progression of
the chronic complications of diabetes. The landmark Diabetes Control and
Complications Trial (DCCT), completed in 1993, showed that risks for development
and/or progression of the chronic complications of type 1 diabetes is closely
related to the degree of glycemic control, as assessed by HbA1c determinations.
The importance of HbA1c as a marker of glycemic control in diabetes mellitus, and
more recently as a diagnostic tool, is now well established. This proposed project
will improve the measurement of HbA1c for optimal clinical and diagnostic use.
This will be done through an established standardization program by continuously
tightening criteria for method and laboratory certification, monitoring performance
of laboratory methods and laboratories, and testing and publishing data on HbA1c
analytical and biological interferences.
Preservation of beta cell function in type 1 diabetes has been identified as an
important goal in delaying progression of the disease at onset and also for
therapeutic intervention. Accurate, standardized measurement of C-peptide will
aid in this goal and is also the subject of this proposal. Standardization will be
accomplished by implementation of a traceability scheme with re-calibration of C-
peptide methods by each manufacturer and monitoring the effects of re-calibration
by evaluation of proficiency testing data. In addition, criteria will be formulated for
acceptable accuracy, precision and specificity of C-peptide assays."
10842324,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic disease causes the most death and disability in the United States (US), and American Indian/Alaska
Native people (ANAIs) are more likely than people of all other races to die of heart disease, diabetes, chronic
lower respiratory disease, cirrhosis, stroke, pneumonia, kidney disease, and hypertension. Among ANAIs age
55 and older, 90% have at least one chronic condition, compared with 78% of their US peers. As the older ANAI
population rapidly increases, with higher rates of serious illness than the general population, there is an urgent
need for strategies to provide culturally tailored palliative and end-of-life care interventions for seriously ill ANAIs.
However, ANAIs are far less likely than their US peers to use palliative care, including advance care planning
(ACP), which involves discussing patient values and goals to align care with patient preferences. ACP leads to
better outcomes for patients, their families, and health systems, including decreased depression, anxiety, and
grief, fewer non-beneficial end-of-life treatments, and reduced cost. ACP is typically documented in advance
directives (ADs) that specify patient preferences for life-sustaining treatments and who can make medical
decisions on their behalf. Yet, less than a third of seriously ill US adults have ADs, and ANAIs age 55 and older
are only half as likely to have ADs as their White peers. Previous research suggests that ANAIs will engage in
ACP and complete ADs when given access to timely and culturally appropriate ACP conversations, but no ACP
communication interventions have been rigorously tested with ANAIs. Our team used community engagement
methods to culturally tailor an ACP communication intervention and pilot the tailored intervention—Jumpstart
ANAI—with 68 seriously ill adult ANAIs at Southcentral Foundation (SCF), a Tribal health system in Alaska. We
recruited 97% of the target sample (n=70) and retained >75% of patients at follow-up. We also found that 95%
of patients stated that Jumpstart ANAI helped them to have ACP conversations with their primary care providers.
This project expands upon a strong community-academic partnership to implement Jumpstart ANAI in
the Tribal health system and evaluate it using an innovative type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation
approach. Our specific aims are to: 1) Engage stakeholders to tailor an implementation plan for the Tribal health
system that integrates Jumpstart ANAI into routine primary care practice; 2) Conduct a cluster-randomized trial
with 40 primary care providers and 280 seriously ill ANAI patients to test the effectiveness of Jumpstart ANAI for
increasing ACP as compared to usual care; and 3) Conduct a rigorous mixed-methods process evaluation using
the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to assess barriers and facilitators to implementing
Jumpstart ANAI system-wide. Improving access to and delivery of culturally appropriate evidence-based ACP is
a high priority for Alaska’s Tribal health leaders and communities. By evaluating the effectiveness of a culturally
tailored ACP intervention and tailoring implementation of the intervention into routine care, this study will provide
critical evidence for improving palliative care and end-of-life care for seriously ill ANAI people and their families."
10841291,"Project Summary
This R35 MIRA renewal application is designed to investigate mechanisms responsible for the exaggerated
effects of alcohol intoxication on the gut, lung, and brain after burn injury. Of the million people per year who
suffer burn injuries in the United States, nearly half of the adult patients are intoxicated at the time of injury.
Intoxicated burn patients have increased morbidity and mortality compared to those who had not been
drinking. The lung is the most frequent organ to fail after a remote injury such as cutaneous burn, with 45% of
burn patients showing some form of lung damage even in the absence of inhalation injury. Pneumonia and
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are among the major complications seen in intoxicated burn
patients. Additionally, cognitive impairment is common among burn patients in the ICU, and it is associated
with a breach of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and neuroinflammation. Little is known about the mechanism by
which alcohol intoxication upregulates the post-burn systemic inflammatory responses that lead to excessive
pulmonary inflammation and increased susceptibility to lung infection nor is it known how cognitive dysfunction
arises in this patient population. A common feature of these two critical organs is the aberrant activation of
local populations of macrophages, alveolar macrophages (AM) in the lung and microglial cells in the brain.
These cells are highly sensitive to stimulation by bacteria and bacterial products. Interestingly, both the post-
burn pulmonary inflammation and the incidence of delirium in intoxicated burn patients follow a disruption in the
integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier secondary to burn. This, along with dysbiosis of the fecal microbiome,
is critically involved in the systemic inflammation seen after alcohol intoxication and burn injury. To date, we
know very little about how and when the intestinal microbiome recovers after remote injury, such as a
cutaneous scald burn, and even less about how environmental factors, including alcohol intoxication prior to
injury, alter that process. In this research program, we will use our clinically-relevant murine model of alcohol
intoxication and burn injury along with clinical samples from burn patients, many of whom misuse alcohol, to
address the following questions: 1) Can innate immunity be restored in the lung after alcohol and burn injury?
2) Do microglia play a role in the heightened cognitive impairment and neuroinflammation when alcohol
proceeds burn injury? 3) Will restoring the gut barrier integrity and microbiome reduce systemic inflammation,
improve the pulmonary response to infections, and lessen neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment? Taken
together, these studies will expand the knowledge of how alcohol exposure alters the gut in the context of
remote injury, such as burns, and may lead to the development of novel therapies to improve outcomes of
patients with burns and other forms of trauma."

Over the past 70 years, research supported by the Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) and the National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), among other organizations, has led to significant advances in congenital
heart disease (CHD) care and outcomes. The GATeway to tHe wEst consoRtium (GATHER) is a collaboration
between Washington University School of Medicine/St. Louis Children’s Hospital and the University of
Colorado/Children's Hospital Colorado, aimed at continuing this progress as a PHN Clinical Research Center
in the next funding cycle. Recognizing the importance of new and emerging research tools as well as key
priorities for future research in CHD, the consortium brings together diverse expertise and resources in basic,
clinical, and translational research, including multi-omics research, health services and outcomes research,
machine learning and big data approaches, digital health technology, and social determinants of health
(SDoH). The GATHER consortium is rooted in a strong track record of past and ongoing collaborations
between investigators and is committed to training junior investigators using a shared mentorship model.
 The GATHER consortium is committed to enhancing diverse perspectives in clinical research through the
recruitment and retention of diverse study populations and the training of junior investigators from diverse
backgrounds. Strategies such as community engagement, leveraging technology for data collection, and
making study participation more accessible are outlined. GATHER represents a unique addition to PHN’s
roster of core sites by drawing from a racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse patient population in
the Midwest and Mountain regions, areas that have historically been under-represented in PHN studies.
 The GATHER consortium plans to develop a multi-center prospective registry, PROTECT-HF: Pediatric
Registry Of heart failure Therapies to Embed Clinical Trials, its design and content informed by clinical experts,
patient and family advocates, and community partners. The goals of this registry will be to study real world
practice variation in guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure, to examine the role of SDoH on
healthcare utilization and outcomes, to characterize responders and non-responders to GDMT, and to develop
risk-prediction models for disease-specific outcomes. This work will be facilitated by novel analytic approaches
and automated data extraction to optimize efficiencies and insights. The PROTECT-HF registry will then be
used as a framework in which to embed clinical trials of novel heart failure therapies, starting with an
exploratory phase Ib/II clinical trial of omecamtiv mecabril, a cardiac myosin activator. The GATHER
consortium and the PROTECT-HF registry’s goals align with the PHN mission of studying and improving health
outcomes in pediatric congenital and acquired heart disease, engaging and supporting families, and training
and educating new investigators."

10842874,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The generation of chemical space and its translation into new functions is one of the main goals of
synthetic chemistry. The BN/CC isosterism (i.e., replacement of a carbon-carbon bond with a boron-nitrogen
bond) has emerged as a viable strategy to increase the chemical space of compounds relevant to biomedical
research.
 We seek to develop enabling tools that are provided by the new expanded chemical space through
BN/CC isosterism of arenes:
 a) In the field of synthetic organic chemistry, we aim to 1) explore novel reactivity and selectivity that
are unattainable by using “conventional” non-boron-containing organic compounds, and 2) discover and
exploit new mechanistic principles for synthesis/catalysis, both as a consequence of the unique electronic
structure created by BN heterocycles. When addressed, synthetic chemists will enjoy · new ligands that
support metal-catalyzed reactions with distinct reactivity/selectivity, and · a versatile 4C+1N+1B synthon for
synthesis.
 b) In the field of chemical biology, we aim to utilize BN-indole and its corresponding amino acid BN-
tryptophan to 1) create novel BN-alloproteins in both bacterial and mammalian cells, 2) develop a novel
bioconjugation platform that is rapid, catalyst-free, chemoselective, and orthogonal to existing
bioconjugation methods, 3) develop a novel isosteric intrinsic fluorophore for characterizing protein
interactions.
 Completion of the proposed aims will yield new fundamental knowledge related to boron in the context
of synthetic organic and biological chemistry. It will generate new synthetic methods and research tools for
the investigation of biological processes and inspire the design and development of new boron-containing
molecules for biomedical applications."
10823951,"Project Summary
Aberrations of chromatin modifying enzymes are frequently found in a wide spectrum of human
diseases. Among them, histone H3 K4 methyltransferase mixed lineage leukemia (MLL1, also
called KMT2A) has been extensively studied in cancer. MLL1 rearrangement is common in acute
pediatric leukemia, in which translocation of one MLL1 allele gives rise to an oncogenic fusion
protein. Other MLL1 mutations, including amplification and overexpression, are commonly found in
multiple cancers with unknown etiology. MLL1 resides in a multi-subunit complex with conserved
components shared among other KMT2 family enzymes, and together they regulate global histone
H3K4 methylation. While most studies focus on MLL1’s role in transcription via canonical H3K4
methylation, MLL1 also has non-canonical functions in regulating important cellular processes. We
will use multidisciplinary approaches to gain new mechanistic insights on how MLL1 affects cancer
development through transcription dependent and independent activities and evaluate its potential
as a therapeutic target in hepatocellular carcinoma."
10845206,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT (OVERALL)
Autoimmune endocrinopathies include a number of conditions in which the immune system destroys healthy
hormone-producing tissues. These conditions affect a large number of Americans, many of them female, but
have not yet been the focus of ACE studies in the past. Moreover, unlike most other autoimmune conditions,
autoimmune endocrinopathies are not usually treated with immunotherapies, despite clear evidence that their
etiology is immune-mediated. Thus, there is an urgent need to better understand autoimmune pathogenesis to
identify targets for immunotherapies in these conditions. This new ACE proposal seeks to delineate mechanisms
of autoimmune chronicity as critical pathways in the establishment of autoimmune endocrinopathies. The
Principal Project delineates the epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms underlying chronicity in autoimmune
endocrinopathies. These studies will determine whether an epigenetic regulator UTX may a role in conversion
of stem-like progenitor CD8+ T cells to effectors in autoimmune endocrinopathies. The Collaborative Project
addresses spatial and temporal determinants of immune chronicity in cancer immunotherapy-related immune
related adverse events (IRAEs). Endocrine IRAEs of great interest given the large proportion of cancer patients
who now receive immunotherapies and develop these unwanted side effects. Finally, many autoimmune
endocrinopathies are sex-biased, and the Pilot Project addresses sexual dimorphism in immune chronicity
pathways. In particular, UTX is an X-linked gene that is differentially expressed in male vs. female CD8+ T cells,
and we will explore UTX’s role in mediating sex differences in progenitor to effector conversion. Our ACE includes
an Administrative Core, which will ensure efficient day-to-day operational support; an ACE Funds Management
Core, which will administer financial and consortium agreements; and an ACE Biorepository Core, which takes
advantage of the well-developed biorepository infrastructure system in place at UCLA. Our program will build a
cohesive and multi-disciplinary team of immunologists, clinicians, and computational biologists to contribute our
deep expertise to the ACE collaborative enterprise."
10845375,"Sensory perception is vital for accurate hand movement, and learning is known to occur in both sensory
and motor systems to keep movement accurate in a changing environment. Unfortunately, how the
brain’s sensory and motor systems interact to achieve this is poorly understood. This knowledge gap limits
advances in areas that depend on understanding the mechanisms underlying sensorimotor function. Existing
roadblocks include: (i) Independent evolution of motor control and sensory perception research, where the
importance of bridging these fields has only recently been recognized. (ii) Research that does bridge sensory
and motor function typically deals with one sensory modality in isolation, rather than the natural multisensory
state of the system. This makes it difficult to translate laboratory research to natural contexts. Hand position,
for example, is perceived through both vision and proprioception (position sense, from the joints and muscles).
(iii) Neuroimaging has identified human cortical regions active during simple multisensory stimuli but has rarely
studied higher level multisensory processes such as visuo-proprioceptive realignment, one form of sensory
learning related to spatial perception. To successfully shape multisensory-motor interactions in human
behavior, the neural basis of complex multisensory processes must be understood. This project addresses all
three roadblocks. The overall objective is to identify, in the context of visuo-proprioceptive processing, the
roles of sensory vs. motor brain systems in sensory vs. motor learning. The central hypothesis is that
sensory and motor brain areas interact reciprocally in hand control, with each having a role in both sensory and
motor learning. Aim 1 will identify the role of sensory vs. motor brain areas in sensory vs. motor learning
using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which transiently and focally reduces neural activity. In
different groups of healthy participants, stimulation will be applied to brain regions traditionally considered
unisensory, multisensory, or motor. Participants will then experience either: (Aim 1A) visuo-proprioceptive
sensory learning; or (Aim 1B) motor learning. If learning is affected by TMS, a causal role for the stimulated
brain region can be inferred. Using neuroimaging, Aim 2 will identify functional connections among
unisensory, multisensory, and motor areas that change in association with visuo-proprioceptive
realignment. This project is innovative in two ways: (i) It represents a shift from current research paradigms by
studying brain regions traditionally considered unisensory, multisensory, and motor in a single set of
experiments comprising multisensory vs. motor learning. (ii) The use of brain stimulation to infer the role of
activity within brain areas, and neuroimaging to identify relevant connections between brain areas. The
significance of the proposed research is that it will address the roadblocks to progress in the field by bridging
sensory and motor research in a multisensory context and testing complex sensory and motor learning
processes involved in natural human behavior."
10845377,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Compared to many other high-income countries, the U.S. has stark maternal health outcomes – both severe
maternal morbidity (SMM) and maternal mortality (MM) have tripled in the U.S. since 1993. Overall, experts
estimate that nearly half of SMM and MM is preventable. Black and Hispanic women have borne the brunt
of this maternal health crisis with much higher rates of severe maternal mortality (SMM) and maternal
mortality (MM) than White women. To address the growing crisis, states increasingly use quality care
collaboratives (QCCs) that aim to train healthcare providers using quality improvement (QI) toolkits. These QI
toolkits outline maternal care processes designed to improve the diagnosis and treatment of maternal health
conditions with the overall aim of reducing SMM and MM. This project will provide the first detailed analysis
of the influence of state QCCs and their QI toolkits on maternal care and health outcomes overall, and
across racial/ethnic groups. The limited data evaluating a few states’ QCCs indicate that certain QCCs and
certain QI toolkits may improve maternal health overall – but even then, racial/ethnic disparities can persist. To
assess the impacts of QCCs on maternal care and health, particularly among Black and Hispanic women, we
will (1) conduct a first-of-its-kind survey of state public health departments, QCCs, and QCC
collaborating hospitals, (2) construct a national state-level database combining the survey data with key
maternal care and health outcomes and other publicly available data for 2003 to 2023. With this novel data,
we will estimate the effects of QCCs and their QI toolkits, particularly how their effects vary by maternal
race/ethnicity. These results will identify which QCCs and QI toolkits are most effective, particularly in addressing
racial/ethnic disparities in maternal health. Specifically, we will use the combined data to assess four research
questions: (Aim 1) How do trends in maternal care processes and health outcomes vary by race/ethnicity,
geography, and other characteristics? (Aim 2) How do QCCs differ? (Aim 3) Do QCCs and their QI toolkits
influence maternal care processes and health outcomes? And, (Aim 4) Which QCCs and QI toolkits most
effectively address disparities in maternal care processes and health outcomes? We will test the hypotheses
that: (H1) generally, QCCs and QI toolkits improve maternal care processes and health outcomes; (H2)
the QCCs and QI toolkits that are most effective in reducing racial/ethnic disparities are those that use
QI toolkits that focus on key drivers of disparities (e.g. pre-existing health and social conditions); and/or
(H3) the QCCs and QI toolkits that are most effective in reducing racial/ethnic disparities are those that
collaborate with hospitals serving greater proportions of the states’ Black and Hispanic women. In so
doing, our proposed study lays a strong foundation for a comprehensive research agenda on the effects of QCCs
on race/ethnic disparities in maternal health which can accelerate improvements in SMM and MM, particularly
among Black and Hispanic women who are disproportionately affected but may not benefit equally from QCCs."

Making NIH Common Fund (CF) datasets FAIR is but the first step in realizing their potential
within the “big data” revolution. Science progresses through the accumulation of knowledge,
which achieves a wide reach only if it is accessible to a diverse spectrum of researchers. While
computer scientists have made substantial strides in modeling knowledge within “knowledge
graphs” (KGs), non-computational scientists can find it hard to interpret the graph-based
reasoning tools and visualizations that accompany KGs because such tools use logical
reasoning that does not account for scientific context or uncertainty and can produce a plethora
of scientifically invalid inferences.
Our CFDE KC will aim to present scientifically valid knowledge produced by CF projects. We will
represent this knowledge as a KG, compliant with existing CFDE and external knowledge
curation efforts. But we will focus on scientific validity through both (a) careful knowledge
extraction, by ensuring that each edge in the KG is either a primary experimental finding or the
result of an expert-applied analysis, and (b) careful knowledge presentation, by building a portal
that de-emphasizes general-purpose graph traversal in favor of single-purpose visualizations.
To implement this KC, we will draw from our experience managing four large-scale NIH-funded
projects that have faced similar challenges in related settings. First, our work on Terra provides
a foundation for securely storing biomedical data and making it available through cloud-based
workspaces. Second, our work on the Common Metabolic Diseases Knowledge Portal provides
a means to distill data into knowledge through expert-designed analyses that produce “summary
representations”, which are then presented through simple visualizations or multi-step
prescriptive workflows. Third, our work on the A2FKP provides experience tailoring knowledge
extraction and presentation to a variety of communities with different cultures and preferences.
Finally, our work on the Biomedical Translator provides experience developing and complying
with standards for knowledge representation and exchange.
In specific aim 1, we will coordinate working groups of CFDE and external investigators to
review the knowledge across CF projects and propose how to extract and represent it within the
KC. In specific aim 2, we will work with CF DCCs to define summary representations of their
data, provide them with software to make these summary representations available to us, and
regularly “pull” and integrate these summaries within a KG compliant with Translator standards.
In specific aim 3, we will use the software UI/UX and search infrastructure developed for the
CMDKP and A2FKP to build a knowledge portal that enables a diverse spectrum of scientists to
visualize and search CF data. In specific aim 4, we will combine our and the CF DCC’s prior
education and outreach strategies to publicize the portal and educate people in its use. Finally,
in specific aim 5, we will interface with other CFDE centers to build a combined Resource Portal
and form partnerships with external resources to amplify the reach of our KC.
Together, these aims will produce a CFDE KC that will unlock the full potential of CF resources
through an emphasis on scientific validity, enabling scientists of all levels of expertise to
understand, trust, and build upon them."
10850859,"There is compelling evidence for a critical role of the maternal and infant gut microbiome in early infant brain
neurodevelopment. Temporal milestones in postnatal infant gut microbiome development align with changes in
early infant brain development, suggesting functional relationships between these two pivotal events. The
premise of our proposal is based on a wealth of studies and new preliminary analyses reported below linking
maternal prenatal anxiety (PNA), a prominent prenatal maternal risk factor, and child neurodevelopment. We
hypothesize that the prenatal maternal microbiome and its influence on newborn neurodevelopment is shaped
by PNA, and that early infant cognition is determined by mother-to-infant microbiome transfer, postnatal
development and biosynthesis of microbiota-derived neuroactive metabolites (NAMs). Our study is framed by a
proposed developmental model that includes two major components; prenatal anxiety and developmental phase
trajectories of the infant gut microbiome. The proposed model has scientific as well as practical strengths, as it
leverages a wealth of existing data collected as part of a large, prospective longitudinal and diverse pregnancy
cohort that has been followed from the first trimester through the child’s 4th year, with extensive longitudinal
characterization of prenatal exposures, child microbiome and other key biological samples, and child
neurodevelopment assessed longitudinally that will enable important and previously neglected incorporation of
potential confounds. We use these components to test the central hypothesis that neurodevelopment is
dependent on age-driven biosynthesis of NAMs through the postnatal period of infant gut-microbiome (IGM)
development. In Aim 1, we use metagenomic analysis of the prenatal maternal vaginal microbiome (MVM) to
identify species and functional biosynthetic pathways for NAMs associated with PNA. We also assess the
potential transfer of maternal anxiety through the initial colonization of the infant gut microbiome by an anxiety
“imprinted” MVM. In Aim 2, we use metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to determine the association
between key stages of IGM development and differential synthesis of NAMs over the first year, attending to
confounds and competing exposures, most notably, maternal diet and infant feeding. In Aim 3, we apply this rich
data to predict neurocognitive assessments from age 1 to 4 years to formally test the temporal relationship
between microbiome phase and neurodevelopment in the first year of life and durability of the microbiota-
neurodevelopment relationship through 4 years of age. The scientific impact of the study will be on advanced
understanding of the role of prenatal exposures; documenting sources of between- and within-individual
differences in the IGM through the first years of life; identifying NAMs with a possible mechanistic role in the
MGB axis; documenting a potentially broad and persistent impact on neurodevelopment."

While evaluating the potential for glucagon receptor antagonists (GRAs) to maintain glucose homeostasis in
T1D rodents, we noted that GRAs promote β−cell survival and regeneration. Remarkably, GRA-treated mice
maintained normal blood glucose, even after the treatment was withdrawn. Our recently published data
suggest that: 1) ablation or antagonism of the glucagon receptor (GcgR) blunts apoptosis and stimulates
regeneration of functional β-cell mass in mice; 2) much of this new insulin+ mass derives from the conversion
of α−cell precursors into insulin-producing cells; and 3) GRAs restore sustainable euglycemia and insulin
production in diabetic NOD mice and in mice grafted with human islets. Our preliminary results suggest that the
β-cytotrophic effects of GRAs occur through both islet autonomous effects and through a well described liver-
α-cell axis4-7 which triggers α-cell hyperplasia through AA-dependent mechanisms (Figure 1). We have
identified Foxn3, a glucagon-responsive transcriptional repressor and novel mediator of glycemia8-11, as the
previously-undefined integrator by which glucagon alters amino acid metabolism. In parallel, we have
identified the GRA-driven upregulation of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), a target of the proliferative
transcriptional co-factor Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) that is expressed in Sox9+ ductal cells, as a key
contributor to GRA-mediated revival of a regenerative niche within the islet. We hypothesize that impaired
glucagon action promotes hepatic Foxn3-mediated α-cell hyperplasia via changes in amino acid metabolism
and an FGF2-mediated regenerative niche within the islet to allow α-cell to β-cell conversion in T1D. We will
evaluate our hypothesis using a cadre of novel, validated, and uniquely-suited mouse models which facilitate
our genetic dissection of the mechanisms linking the loss of glucagon signaling to altered hepatic utilization of
amino acids, α-cell hyperplasia, and the restoration of functional β-cell mass via two aims. 1) Using PANIC-
ATTAC diabetic mice, cultured murine islets, and cultured human islets, we will examine the islet-autonomous
effects of glucagon receptor antagonism or ablation on β-cell survival and β-cell regeneration. 2) We will
examine α-cell hyperplasia, β-cell survival and the regeneration of functional β−cell mass after liver-specific
deletion or overexpression of Foxn3."

Herein, we propose an approach that harnesses tissue engineering principles to develop an immunological niche
(IN) in vivo to enable harvest of physiologically relevant immune populations. The central hypothesis of this work
is that INs can be created to reflect aspects of the innate and/or adaptive immune system that correlate with the

the scaffolds. This section will create a non-invasive sensor and multivariate signature reflective of adaptive
immune changes within the surrogates and harness both innate and adaptive INs to investigate mechanistic
questions about innate-adaptive crosstalk in the development of MS. Taken together these studies will create
engineered immunological niches and non-invasive sensors that enable the creation of enhanced diagnostics,
prognostics, treatment monitors, and longitudinal immunology studies without euthanasia.
 This work is at the intersection of immunology and biomaterials and will require biomaterials synthesis,
scRNAseq, computational analysis, tissue engineering, immunology, and biosensor design and validation. The

 This project aims at understanding the molecular mechanisms governing lymphatic dysfunction in a
mouse model of neurodevelopmental disorder, i.e. the fmr1-KO mice, and their involvement in social and
behavior. Meningeal lymphatic drainage, an essential system for the maintenance of brain function in adult and
aged mice, was recently demonstrated develop postnatally during a critical window of brain maturation. We
found that fmr1, the gene responsible for Fragile X Syndrome, is expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells, and
that loss of fmr1 results in altered meningeal lymphatic morphology and function, via regulation of junction
protein patterning. Furthermore, we found that altered lymphatic function in fmr1-KO mice results in decrease
IFNg production (essential for neuronal homeostasis)in the meninges, that is rescued upon drainage
improvement Finally, restoring draining function results in improved neuronal activation and social behavior in
fmr1-KO mice. We therefore hypothesize that meningeal lymphatic dysfunction, through dysregulation of local
immune cells, contributes to behavioral impairments in Fragile X.
 Guided by our preliminary data, we propose to address our hypothesis using the following aims:
Aim1: Determine how fmr1 regulates meningeal lymphatic function.
Aim2: Decipher the role of fmr1-induced lymphatic dysfunction in IFN T cell maintenance.
Aim3: Address the contribution of meningeal lymphatic dysfunction in FXS-associated social behavior
 Collectively, Our proposed studies will have a broad impact by: a) characterizing meningeal lymphatic
function in FXS; b) deciphering new molecular regulators of lymphatic function; c) demonstrating the central
role of the meningeal lymphatic in the regulation of social behavior d) identifying and characterizing new
molecular targets for the treatment of FXS; and e) providing evidence that the meningeal lymphatics represent
a novel target for therapeutic strategies in neurodevelopmental disorders."

Breakthroughs in our understanding of how the brain generates simple and complex behavior and how it
malfunctions in neurological disease and pyschopathology require researchers who have a strong foundation in
neuroscience and a deep understanding of the evolutionary contingencies of human neurobiology and behavior.
Since its inception in 1978, the Neural Systems and Behavior (NS&B) course at the MBL in Woods Hole, MA,
has been the premier course for this kind of interdisciplinary training in multi-level analysis of brain-behavior
relationships. NS&B is an intensive, eight-week summer course that combines lectures, laboratory exercises,
and student-directed research in a unique learning environment. The twenty course students typically come from
diverse disciplines including neuroscience, animal behavior, psychology, mathematics, computer science,
physics, and engineering. They range in their prior training from first year Ph.D. students to faculty members
who are changing fields. The rigorous lectures by the best teachers and researchers in the field provide a solid
foundation for understanding a wide range of subjects, from the basics of molecular genetics and neurogenomics
to electrophysiology and signal processing, and even cognition. Visiting scholars provide further exposure to the
most recent breakthroughs in the study of the neural basis of behavior and cognition. Lunch discussions about
science, ethics, and career development constitute integral parts of the course. The laboratory exercises
(modules) constitute the core of the course and occupy the majority of the students’ time, providing the students
with hands-on experience using state of the art equipment addressing cutting-edge problems. The course is
divided into four two-week cycles with different laboratory modules and sets of faculty, each building upon the
prior experiences of the course. The modules encourage investigations at multiple levels of biological
organization. To maximize learning of research concepts and techniques, the course uses an array of organisms
and preparations to teach techniques and address questions relevant to behavior, the functioning of neural
systems, and neural disease. By the end of each two-week cycle, the students have not only mastered complex
techniques, they also have collected and analyzed data from a research project that they conceived and
designed. The creativity and diversity of these projects are a singular feature of the NS&B course and have never
been replicated in any other educational setting. Students find NS&B to be a life-changing event, not only
because it is intellectually challenging and provides hands on training but also because of the uniquely supportive
environment and networking opportunities that have been hallmarks of the course since its inception. Thus, this
highly successful course provides immersive, hands-on training in state-of the-art research skills essential for
fulfilling objective #1 of the NIMH Strategic Plan: “To define the mechanisms of complex behaviors” by focusing
on neural mechanisms of behavior across the spectrum from single cells to circuits to the whole organism."

The objective of the proposed INfectious Diseases Summer Program Integrating Research at Emory (INSPIRE)
research training program is to prepare undergraduate students from groups historically excluded from and
underrepresented in science and medicine from across the country for a career in infectious disease (ID).
Racial discrimination in healthcare delivery has led to significant mistrust of a public health system which many
individuals believe has been used against them because of their race and ethnicity. The fact that such
discriminatory practices have existed is associated with the lack of representation of individuals from diverse
backgrounds in ID. Individuals who identify as African American, Latinx, Native American, or as Pacific Islanders
comprise approximately 39% of the college population but individuals from these groups earn only 13% of
doctoral degrees in the life sciences and constitute only 13% of recent medical graduates and 7% of full-time
medical faculty. As one of the nation’s leading research universities, Emory University is grounded in both
academic excellence and a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). The academic resources at
Emory include access to dedicated world-class faculty and outstanding facilities and equipment with a reputation
for being one of the best academic ID research centers in the world. At the same time, Emory faculty and student
body are increasingly diverse and inclusive of historically underrepresented groups and have powerful research
and training partnerships with the neighboring historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) including
Morehouse, Spelman, and Clark Atlanta. The objective of our training program is to prepare 48
underrepresented undergraduate students from throughout the country for a career in ID research by
exposing them to hands-on research, conducting courses for professional and research skills development, and
strengthening Emory’s mentorship capacity to addresses identity and underrepresentation. In Aim 1,
undergraduate students from groups historically excluded from and underrepresented in science and medicine
will be matched with a research mentor and a laboratory or clinical field site for a 10-week in-person summer
research experience that will result in an abstract and poster presentation at a research symposium conducted
at the end of the period. In Aim 2, we will deliver in-person and online courses on: a) career guidance to enter
medical and/or graduate school; b) biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research topics related to the NIAID
mission; and c) understanding how researchers from underrepresented groups can successfully pursue a path
in research and healthcare. In Aim 3, we will: a) provide undergraduate trainees with agency to select from a
pool of identity mentors who have diverse ethnic, racial, cultural backgrounds, and experiences, who will
maintain regular contact the trainees for one year; b) conduct Mentoring Up workshops for 75 post-doctoral
fellows and junior faculty; and c) provide workshops on mentoring and facilitation for 87 faculty members
who are research and identity mentors."
10832642,"Significance/Innovation: Utilizing non-coplanar beams in radiotherapy can significantly improve dosimetry for
better normal organ sparing and tumor targeting. However, the optimality of such therapy requires extensive
and efficient utilization of non-coplanar beams that are incompatible with existing radiotherapy platforms. The
widely available C-arm gantry systems are collision prone, cumbersome, and require undesirable patient couch
motion to achieve the non-coplanar angles. The existing robotic system lacks posterior beams and a planning
system to integrally optimize beam orientation and fluence, making it extremely limited in achievable dosimetry,
target sizes, applicable disease sites, and throughput.
Motivated by these clinical and market needs UCLA and RadiaBeam are developing a new robotic
radiotherapy platform called Polaris that overcomes the limitations of existing radiotherapy systems, with the
following innovative advantages: 1. A super compact 6MV linear accelerator enables unobstructed access to
4π solid angle, including posterior beams. 2. A mathematical framework for integrated beam orientation,
source-to-tumor distance, and fluence map optimization, which can efficiently create substantially better plans
than the clinical state-of-the-art. 3. A 3D image guidance system will be implemented for the first time on a
robotic radiotherapy system without impeding the degrees of freedom in non-coplanar delivery. 4. The
combination of hardware and software allows superior dosimetry to be efficiently delivered to targets of all
sizes, making our system a superior replacement of all C-arm gantry systems and the existing robotic
radiotherapy system as a general-purpose radiotherapy machine.
During the SBIR project (NIH Phase II 5R44CA183390-04), Celestial Oncology Inc. was founded to bring the
Polaris system to market, and received a $6M series A investment in 2020. This NIH SBIR Phase IIB bridge
project will accelerate the completion of the last technical, regulatory, and clinical steps required to bring this
life-saving therapy to the clinic. We propose the following aims:
Aims: 1a: Mechanically synchronize the X-ray source and detector robots. 1b. Collect projections for circular
and helical trajectories for CBCT reconstruction. 1c. Integrate the imaging component for end-to-end IGRT
accuracy validation. 2a. Complete the design, manufacturing, verification, and validation of the clinical system.
2b. Submit for US market clearance. 2c. Establish and certify a Quality Management System. 3a. Installation
and acceptance tests of the 4π radiotherapy system at UCLA. 3b. Early phase clinical study.
Impact: Polaris will serve as a superior replacement of all general-purpose machines with advantages in dose
conformity, automation, and throughput. These advantages will drive rapid adoption. The success of this
project will clear the last hurdles between the current level of technical development and what is needed to be
commercially and clinically ready."

The objective of the Environmental Toxicology and Epidemiology (ETEP) training program is to train future
leaders in the environmental health sciences by providing research training that bridges environmental
toxicology (basic research) and epidemiology (population-based research) with applications to human disease
prevention. The program is based on the premise that environmental health scientists who specialize in
toxicology or epidemiology require training in multiple disciplinary approaches to conduct impactful translational
research, encompassing the rapidly evolving approaches used in genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics and
data science. The proposed program represents evolutionary changes to our highly successful program, now
in its 40th year. In this submission, we request 6 predoctoral and 3 postdoctoral positions (at levels 0, 1 and 2).
Predoctoral trainees specialize in environmental epidemiology or toxicology, and complete foundation and
advanced courses in the non-specialization area (e.g., epidemiology trainees complete toxicology courses and
vice versa), and all trainees complete a common core curriculum that includes courses in bioinformatics or
data science and the responsible conduct of research. Predoctoral trainees must have a baccalaureate
degree with relevant scientific coursework preparation and will be enrolled in a PhD program in the
Environmental Health Sciences Department, which has a distinguished history of graduate training in
toxicology and environmental health sciences. The expected duration of trainee support from the ETEP
training grant is two years; the expected duration of predoctoral training is 4-5 years. Postdoctoral trainees will
work with our ETEP faculty, complete research training and career development modules, and will be
encouraged to submit an individual NRSA Postdoctoral Fellowship application in their first year of training.
Qualified postdoctoral applicants must demonstrate motivation for careers in the environmental health sciences
addressing toxicology or epidemiology research, and have a PhD, MD, DVM or other appropriate doctoral
degree. The program is implemented and evaluated with the assistance of an Executive Committee, External
Advisory Committee, and a diverse pool of outstanding faculty mentors drawn from across the University of
Michigan."

Dr. Matthew B. Bevers is a neurologist in the divisions of Stroke, Cerebrovascular, and Critical Care Neurology
at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) whose goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise
in mechanisms of secondary brain injury after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). His career development plan
leverages the resources of a world-class training environment by bringing together a team of mentors and
collaborators at a leading academic institution, Harvard Medical School, including both BWH and the
Massachusetts General Hospital. Dr. Bevers has already obtained preliminary results supporting a role for the
IL33/ST2 pathway in the pathophysiology of intracerebral hemorrhage and demonstrating the feasibility of his
proposed studies into its role in the development of perihematomal edema and regulation of T cell and
monocyte populations. Under the primary mentorship of Dr. W. Taylor Kimberly at MGH with a mentorship
committee including Drs. Page Pennell and Francisco Quintana at BWH and scientific advisors including Drs.
Lauren Sansing and Kevin Sheth at Yale University, Dr. Bevers proposes: 1) To identify a link between
increases in a regulator of immune cell function – soluble ST2 – and perihematomal edema and functional
outcome after ICH and 2) to identify changes in populations of immune effector cells associated with elevated
sST2 and 3) to show the effect of manipulating the ST2/IL33 system on those immune cells. The overall goal
of this project is to begin to explore a mechanistic pathway by which the initial injury from intracerebral
hemorrhage leads to initiation of cerebral edema and ultimate neurologic outcome. By bringing together novel
conceptual and technical approaches to the study of brain edema and immunology, this project will generate
new insights into mechanisms of secondary brain injury. In the long term, Dr. Bevers' career goal is to identify
unique molecular targets and develop novel therapies to improve neurologic recovery after hemorrhagic stroke.
The proposed patient-oriented research project, along with mentorship and structured career development and
scientific training, will provide Dr. Bevers with the skills and experience needed to become an independent
investigator in the field of acute neurovascular injury."
10833148,"Project Summary/Abstract
The use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has significantly reduced HIV-related morbidity and
mortality. However, cART may exacerbate the central nervous system (CNS)-related adverse effects on mental
health for people with HIV (PWH). These adverse effects may result in ART discontinuation with undesirable
downstream consequences such as HIV disease progression, decreased health outcomes, and increased
likelihood of HIV transmission, causing public health concerns. Depression is the most frequently reported mental
health comorbidity caused by CNS injury in PWH, with prevalence ranging from 20% to 60%. Understanding
factors (e.g., drug-drug interactions) contributing to ART-related depression is critical and remains a high priority
NIMH research area. In addition, since PWH must continue cART indefinitely, optimizing sequential cART
treatments over a long-time span tailored to individuals’ evolving clinical characteristics and treatment histories
is important for improving long-term mental health for PWH. However, there are numerous possible drug
combinations with complicated drug-drug interactions and thus creating complex data patterns, such as
heterogeneity, high-dimensionality, and sparseness, making it highly challenging to develop appropriate
statistical models for these problems - which is a critical gap we aim to fill. This proposal will leverage large
public HIV datasets, including Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), to develop data-driven approaches to
facilitate deciphering cART-depression relations and guide more effective cART treatments. This proposal is
organized into three aims: 1) Develop Bayesian methods to learn longitudinal cART effects on depression and
investigate effect modifiers (e.g., polymorphic drug metabolism, aging); 2) Develop Bayesian decision
frameworks to optimize personalized sequential cART assignments with the goal of improving long-term mental
health outcomes for PWH; (3) encapsulate statistical methods and computational algorithms into user-friendly
open-source software for practical use, clinical translation, and dissemination. Findings from this study are
expected to expand our understanding of cART effects on depression, and have potential clinical utility to
facilitate precision medicine in HIV."
10833067,"Identifying the extent of brain tumor margins for radiation treatment planning remains a challenging task due to
the infiltrative nature of these tumors and limitations in current standard imaging methods. Multiple studies
including our own have demonstrated that an MR technique for detecting metabolites in tissue, MR spectroscopic
imaging or spectroscopic MRI (sMRI), can detect areas of infiltrating tumor with a high degree of sensitivity and
specificity, enabling better radiation treatment of areas that lead to early recurrence and extending life. sMRI
enables the identification of tumor extent that is marked by increased Choline/N-Acetylaspartate ratios, including
regions that are not detectable by diagnostic MRI and that are normally left untreated. By allowing these
previously undetected regions to be treated, sMRI has the potential to improve the efficacy of radiation treatment
and significantly delay recurrence. In our 3-site sMRI-guided radiation dose escalation pilot study which was
completed in 2019, we were able to demonstrate feasibility and safety. Survival analysis of all 30 GBM patients
shows a promising median overall survival (OS) of 23 months compared to 16 months OS for GBM patients
receiving standard-of-care. Our trial has been approved as a National Clinical Trial Network (ECOG-ACRIN)
trial (EAF211). This is a great opportunity to disseminate this technique with staff support from ACRIN and
American College of Radiology (ACR). We will achieve the goal in the renewal funding period of our current
project by leveraging diverse expertise at three research sites and collaboration with Siemens Healthineers to
engineer and validate technological improvements needed to improve sMRI acquisition, analysis, and clinical
integration. These improvements include: (1) updated rapid and motion-robust sMRI for improved image quality;
(2) new accelerated data processing pipelines to return Cho/NAA ratio maps to PACS for clinically timely
radiology reporting; (3) new processing, display, and analysis methods that will present metabolite maps in an
efficient manner with a clinician-friendly interface that enables integration with radiation treatment planning
software systems; and (4) development of new tools to predict the optimal baseline RT planning strategies using
sMRI. The completion of this study will provide robust sMRI acquisition methods and software tools that are
ready to be deployed in clinical use and which will help guide important treatment decisions."
10833069,"Project Summary
 Science is best learned by doing what scientists do, especially in performing authentic scientific
investigations where the unknowns are many, the design to experimentally explore the unknowns is complex,
the instruments and expertise to execute the experiment(s) are advanced, and a highly skilled and informed
mentor is critical. The New Hampshire Academy of Science (NHAS) believes that the pursuit of scientific
investigations that contribute to scientific understanding and inspire the pursuit of STEM careers should be
available to all students. In our northern area of NH and VT, opportunities for pre-college students to perform
meaningful and inspiring scientific research with teachers as effective science mentors are extremely limited or
non-existent. The NHAS intends to help resolve these limited opportunities by using its advanced STEM Lab
and its connections with mentors in our scientific community to greatly expand its support of middle and high
school students and their teachers in experiencing discovery-based science. The NHAS has established a well-
equipped primary satellite STEM laboratory at the Fairbanks Museum and Planetarium (FMP) that has a close
relationship with the economically depressed rural north of VT in order to advance the museum’s science
programs and offer students experiences in inquiry-based research. The NHAS will also establish a primary site
at Colby Sawyer College (CSC) that will make the design and execution of research-based activities part of the
learning experience of future biology/science teachers at CSC with IDeA Network of Biomedical Research
Excellence (INBRE) support. CSC will also function as a geographically strategic location for outreach to
secondary schools in the rural center of NH. A small number of more modest secondary satellite laboratories will
be established in regional schools for students to perform research that matches their abilities and interests.
Teachers will be provided professional development in the day-to-day practices of professional scientists to
transform those teachers into inspirational mentors for their students. This will influence these teachers and their
peers to performing inquiry-based science investigations in their respective schools. A web-based system will
provide peer-to-peer student, teacher, and mentor platforms to ensure that students and teachers have the
constant intellectual and personal support that they need for career advancement. There will be multiple
opportunities for students and teachers to present their research at regional and national science events
including the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Parents will be
encouraged to attend these events as well as more local conferences to help them appreciate the opportunities
in STEM careers for their children. This long-term mentoring support for students and teachers on both personal
and intellectual levels serves a critical need for attracting and retaining underserved students into science and
health careers. With this grant, the STEM Labs of the NHAS, FMP, and resources at CSC will create a vibrant
scientific community in the region, where students, teachers, and parents have a shared and enduring role."

 This K23 application outlines a novel area of clinical research that meets a growing public health need
as people who inject drugs (PWID) represent a disproportionate number of new HIV cases with limited
knowledge about the programming and linkage to care needed to support pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
usage among this population. The research aims are designed to ensure Dr. Matthew Murphy's (PI) future
research independence in HIV prevention and PrEP use for those with substance use disorders (SUD) at the
greatest risk of HIV infection by providing preliminary data for a future R01 application. The specific aims of the
K23 proposal are to 1) conduct qualitative interviews with 20 CJ-involved male PWID to evaluate barriers and
facilitators to PrEP initiation, adherence, and linkage to care after release from incarceration; 2) develop a
“PrEPare-for-Release” intervention and conduct an open label pilot intervention with 15 male PWID who are
being released from incarceration and 3) conduct an RCT of the “PrEPare-for-Release” intervention among
100 male PWID who are being released from incarceration. In order to both achieve those aims and attain
research independence, Dr. Murphy will receive training in HIV prevention approaches for those with SUD
within the criminal justice (CJ) system, qualitative research methodology used to identify barriers and
facilitators to HIV prevention care, approaches to behavioral intervention development and evaluation as well
as training in the responsible conduct of research. The mentorship team, made up of leading experts in related
fields of clinical and public health research from both Brown University and nearby Yale University, are
incredibly well suited to ensure both successful attainment of the research aims as well as future research
independence for the PI. Dr. Philip A Chan (primary mentor), as a leader in the field of PrEP clinical research,
will be a key expert on the successful implementation of the PrEP care continuum for this population and
conducting trials evaluating interventions to improve its use. Additional mentorship for this proposal includes
Dr. Josiah Rich (co-mentor), a global leader on intervention development to improve SUD management and
HIV infection risk during the period of transition from incarceration to the community, Dr. Amy Nunn (co-
mentor), a leading expert on qualitative methodology related to PrEP care and health inequalities with
significant prior experience working with CJ-involved populations, Dr. Trace Kershaw (co-mentor), a global
leader on behavioral intervention development to reduce HIV infection risk in populations with SUDs, and Dr.
Christopher Schmid (co-mentor), former chair of biostatistics at Brown's School of Public Health with significant
experience in clinical trial design and an expert in quantitative methodology."
10833209,"Project Summary
Understanding how visual information is processed and transformed by cortical and subcortical pathways
to generate visually guided behavior is fundamental for visual research. As a critical sensorimotor center,
the superior colliculus (SC) in the mammalian midbrain mediates visually guided behaviors in a context-
dependent manner and holds great promise for understanding neural principles for the processing and
transformation of visual signals into appropriate behavioral responses. The visuosensory layer of SC (or
SCs) receives direct bottom-up relay of visual information from the retina, as well as inputs from multiple
other visual structures. How the information from different sources is integrated by SCs neurons to
differentially influence the processing and transformation of visual signals for context-dependent
behavioral control remains largely unclear. In this project, by focusing on visual processing and
transformation underlying two salient SC-mediated visually guided behaviors, defense behavior induced
by high-field looming visual stimuli and approach behavior induced by low-field moving dots, we will
investigate how the two major inputs of SC, the glutamatergic input from the primary visual cortex (V1)
and GABAergic input from the ventral geniculate nucleus (vLGN), contribute to the shaping of SC
processing. We will test an overarching hypothesis that V1 and vLGN inputs act together to regulate the
gain and selectivity of visual features of SC neurons to achieve context-dependent modulation of visual
behaviors. In Aim 1, we will examine how V1 input modulate visual response properties of SCs neurons
in a lamina-dependent manner and how it contributes to selection of defensive reactions in response to
high-field threatening visual stimuli though eliciting competitive interactions between SCs subcircuits. In
Aim 2, we will examine the functional role of vLGN input in modulating SCs neuron responses to various
visual stimuli and how it plays a role in the context-dependent modulation of size preference in approach
behavior. Though these proposed studies, we hope to greatly enhance our understanding of functional
organization, signal integration, intracollicular/interlaminar interactions as well as functional modulation in
SC circuits."

Age dependent microbial dysbiosis is now considered to be a hallmark of aging. Understanding
the mechanisms by which the gut microbiome modulates aging phenotypes will yield new
avenues for the treatment and prevention of age-related disease. Our work has shown that
high-fat diet (HFD) and intermittent fasting (IF) diet generate distinct gut microbiomes, and have
contrasting-effects on cellular senescence. One central idea of the parent R01 grant is that diet
dependent changes in gut microbiome composition modulate cellular senescence. However, the
parent grant did not propose any molecular mechanism by which the gut microbiome may
impact senescence. This diversity grant proposes a mechanistic study that tests a novel
hypothesis that the microbiomes generated by HFD and IF differentially affect gut barrier
function, resulting in the translocation of Molecular Associated Molecular Patterns (MAMPs) with
opposing effects on senescence and macrophage function in Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT).
Aim 1 will investigate the effect of the microbiomes produced by IF and HFD on gut barrier
integrity and characterize the microbiota that translocate into VAT. Single cell RNAseq will be
done to reveal how microbiome composition impacts polarization of the various types of
macrophages in visceral fat. Aim 2 will employ a combination of in-vivo, and in-vitro assays to
directly study how translocated MAMPs affect preadipocyte, adipocytes and macrophages, with
regard to senescence and macrophage function at the molecular level. This supplement
proposal provides the candidate with comprehensive cross-disciplinary training in the fields of
immunology, microbiome, and aging biology. This supplement will prepare the candidate to
successfully undertake and complete cutting-edge research as he develops his career as
geriatric immunologist."
10838169,"Cooperative catalysis or catalysis involving metal-ligand cooperation is a highly versatile approach in
catalysis that have resulted in a myriad of highly efficient synthetic methods and conferred exceptional value to
chemical synthesis of bioactive and/or pharmaceutical compounds. Despite extraordinary advances on this
research topic, there are still much need to develop new cooperative systems based on unique ligand designs to
enable the development of new and/or much improved synthetic methods for chemical synthesis.
 In 2014, the PI initiated a program on the development of bifunctional biaryl-2-ylphosphine ligands that are
designed to enable cooperative gold(I) catalysis. These ligands feature remote basic groups that can engage
bonding interactions with substrates or reagents during catalysis and thereby achieve ligand-metal cooperation.
Several preliminary studies, including a ppm-level gold-catalyzed addition of carboxylic acid to alkyne, an
asymmetric isomerization of alkyne into allene, and trapping of catalytically generated σ-allenylgold
intermediate with aldehyde, have validated the ligand design and the cooperative nature of the catalysis.
 As the major focus of the PI’s future effort, this proposal seeks to apply this cooperative gold(I) catalysis
strategy to the development of asymmetric transformations of exceptional synthetic values. These include
expedient construction of chiral butenolids and 2,5-disubstituted pyrrolines and asymmetric propargylation
reactions/propargylic C-H functionalizations. The extension of this strategy to much cheaper cooperative Cu(I)
and Ag(I) catalysis offers new and distinct opportunities in asymmetric enolate protonation, which would open
valuable access to various carbonyl products. The transition to functionalized N,N-bidentate ligands would
enable the application of the cooperative ligand design concept to a much broader range of metal catalysis and
offer unprecedented opportunities to manipulate carbonyl compounds in asymmetric manners.
 This proposal, if implemented, would introduce a range of new and versatile chiral bifunctional ligands to
metal catalysis and inspire increasing research effort in cooperative catalysis. Moreover, the methods developed
would provide efficient access to a variety of chiral structures of high value to chemical synthesis in general and
pharmaceutical R&D in particular."

 Modeling cell type-specific responses to drugs is an important yet challenging topic in drug
development and personalized medicine. Our research program has developed a suite of algorithms for
predicting cell-line level drug responses, and seeks to address the next-step questions in improving the
transferability of predicting cell type-specific and combinatorial drug responses. Our goal over the next five
years is to tackle the following three major challenges that hinder the transferability of drug response
models. The first challenge is delivering drug response models across datasets generated by different
platforms and labs. The second challenge is transferring drug response predictions from in vitro systems
to humans. The third challenge is the heterogeneity of the samples, which can hinder the effectiveness of
targeted therapy due to the acquisition of mutations and the evolution of tumors to evade the immune
system. To address these challenges, we will focus on improving the robustness of models across
datasets by establishing coherence networks of drugs. We will leverage and fine-tune large language
models to refine our collection of literature-based drug information and extract new features for drugs. We
will also explore the possibility of using the heterogeneity of the samples to improve the accuracy and
robustness of drug response models. Overall, we envision that our research program will contribute to
personalized medicine and expedite the drug development process."
10837794,"Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a major health issue. After the primary injury, there is substantial secondary injury
attributable to infiltrating immune cells, cytokine release, reactive oxygen species, excitotoxicity, and other
mechanisms. Despite many preclinical and clinical trials designed to limit such secondary damage, no successful
therapies have emerged. However, we have found that Immune-modifying nanoParticles (IMP) are a strong
candidate for a clinically translatable acute pharmacologic intervention for TBI. IMP are highly negatively
charged, 500 nm-diameter particles composed of the FDA-approved biodegradable biopolymer, carboxylated
poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA-COOH). After intravenous (IV) administration, IMP bind to the macrophage
receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) on monocytes. Monocytes bound to IMP no longer travel to sites
of inflammation, but instead are sequestered in the spleen. Because IMP specifically target the MARCO+ subset
of monocytes, it is distinctly different from other approaches that non-specifically target all monocyte/macrophage
lineage cells including microglia. IV treatment with IMP in two different TBI models profoundly reduced the
number of immune cells infiltrating into the brain, mitigated the inflammatory status of the infiltrating cells, and
reduced levels of an array of cytokines and chemokines. More importantly, IMP treatment resulted in attenuated
edema, preservation of brain tissue, and significant preservation of both physiologic visual and motor function.
The proposed studies will examine IMP-mediated changes in gene expression that alter the inflammatory status
of infiltrating cells, limit gliosis, reduce edema, and promote neuronal survival. They also will examine effects of
IMP on other cell types including microglia, progenitor cells, and other immune cells. Notably, IMP are made of
an FDA-approved material that is stable at room temperature and could easily be given immediately IV after TBI
in the field by EMTs or in the emergency room. Mechanistically the proposed studies will help to understand
more clearly the effects of infiltrating hematogenous monocyte-derived macrophages after TBI. Significantly,
they also will help to develop a potentially effective and practical therapy for human TBI."

 The prevalence of Alzheimer disease (AD) is projected to increase as the population ages, and current
treatments are only minimally effective. Recently, emphasis has been placed on understanding and treating
the factors that influence early brain pathology in order to slow the ultimate clinical expression of AD.
Transcranial photobiomodulation (t-PBM) with near-infrared (NIR) light penetrates robustly into the cerebral
cortex, stimulating the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and also significantly increases cerebral blood flow
(CBF). Early data suggests t-PBM may be efficacious in improving cognitive deficits in early AD and in
amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). This project aims to test, in a randomized controlled trial, the
efficacy and safety of 24 sessions of t-PBM, delivered over 8 weeks and compared to sham, in improving
clinical symptoms of aMCI. Additionally, we will explore the brain mechanisms of t-PBM in aMCI, by testing
whether baseline tau burden (measured with 18F-MK6240), or changes in mitochondrial function measures
over 8 weeks (measured by 31P-MRSI) moderate the changes observed in cognitive functions after t-PBM
therapy. We will also use changes in fMRI blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) after a single treatment,
to demonstrate t-PBM-dependent increases in prefrontal cortex (PFC) cortical blood flow (CBF). The study will
be done in parallel at New York University, Nathan Kline Institute and at Massachusetts General Hospital. The
importance of this study is threefold: (1) it targets aMCI, an important prodromal stage of AD, which lacks
adequate approved treatments, (2) it evaluates the efficacy and safety of t-PBM, an innovative, non-invasive
technology which has a well-established safety profile, for improving brain function and cognition at the
prodromal AD stages, and, (3) explores the association of t-PBM treatment effects with important biomarkers
relevant for AD illness progression. If effects are confirmed, the present study will both support short-term
clinical development of an easy to scale device for the treatment of aMCI and AD, while also validating
biomarkers for the development of future, novel modulation strategies."
10837797,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Prostate cancer is the most prevalent cancer in men and the second leading cause of cancer death. Prostatec-
tomy is one of the most common primary treatments for prostate cancer, where surgeons face two main goals:
prostate cancer cure and nerve preservation. However, with little visual acuity for nerve plexus recognition and
conclusive cancer delineation, ideal outcomes for patients continue to challenge even experienced surgeons.
Positive surgical margins and nerve damage occur in up to 21 and 60% of patients, respectively, resulting in
poor cancer control as well as incontinence and impotence severely affecting post-operative quality of life. No
clinically approved methods exist to enhance direct cancer or nerve plexus visualization intraoperatively. Thus,
technology to enable the direct visualization of cancer tissue and nerves simultaneously in real time would greatly
reduce associated comorbidities and significantly improve prostatectomy outcomes. Fluorescence Guided Sur-
gery (FGS) has successfully integrated into clinical medicine with only two FDA-approved fluorophores, providing
surgeons real-time visualization. FGS systems operate mainly at near infrared (NIR, 700-900 nm) wavelengths,
where tissue chromophore absorbance, autofluorescence and scatter fall to local minima, allowing high contrast
imaging at up to centimeter depths. A number of targeted NIR contrast agents are under development, including
nerve- and prostate-specific probes that together would provide an integrated FGS tool for prostatectomy. In the
US, >80% of prostatectomies are performed using robotic-assistance, where the da Vinci surgical robot (Intuitive
Surgical) is the most common and is equipped standard with a NIR fluorescence-imaging channel capable of
real-time visualization. Herein, we will collaborate with Drs. Jonathan Sorger (Intuitive Surgical) and Scott Davis
(Dartmouth) to develop a multicolor FGS solution for prostatectomy that highlights both cancer and nerve tissues
to improve patient outcomes. Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is overexpressed in the majority of
prostate cancers making it a promising target for prostate cancer imaging. A handful of molecules have shown
high affinity for PSMA following labeling, which have been extensively investigated, where 800 nm PSMA tar-
geted IS-002 has successfully completed Phase I clinical trials sponsored by Intuitive Surgical. Herein, we will
develop a NIR, spectrally-distinct, nerve-specific fluorophore for co-administration with PSMA-targeted IS-002 to
bring this new FGS paradigm to prostate cancer patients. In exciting preliminary work, our team has synthesized
NIR nerve-specific fluorophores that can be imaged with clinical FGS systems. Herein, 700 nm NIR nerve-spe-
cific probes will be synthetically tuned for co-administration with PSMA-specific 800 nm IS-002 and validated for
future translation to guided prostatectomy. These goals will be accomplished through the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Synthesize 700 nm NIR nerve-specific FGS probes. Aim 2: Quantify preclinical pharmacology and toxi-
cology of NIR nerve-specific probes co-administered with IS-002. Aim 3: Select a lead nerve-specific probe for
co-administration with IS-002 through demonstration of nerve- and prostate cancer-specific contrast."
10837905,"Project Summary. The V1A-specific arginine vasopressin receptor has recently become the focus of CNS research
when an association between the receptor gene and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is identified. Dysregulation of
V1A activity has been suggested as a fundamental mechanism underlying ASD pathophysiology. Recent studies
revealed that V1A antagonists can regulate the effect of the AVP hormone, thereby tackling a potential root cause of
ASD development. PET is capable of quantifying biochemical processes in vivo, and a suitable V1A PET ligand would
substantially improve our understanding of V1A-mediated AVP signaling under different pathophysiological conditions,
otherwise inaccessible by ex vivo (destructive) analysis, particularly in higher species. Quantification of V1A in living
brain by PET would provide the assessment of distribution and expression and target engagement of new V1A-
targeted neurotherapeutics. To date, no successful examples have been demonstrated to image V1A-specific AVP
for human use, representing a significant deficiency of our ability to study this target in vivo for V1A. Therefore, we
propose to develop a novel PET ligand that can fill this void, as the first translational imaging tool.
 The PI has recently developed a novel V1A-specific AVP ligand [11C]PF-184563 at MGH in 2021. While this
compound showed high potency and excellent selectivity, it is not likely pursued due to low brain penetration. In our
2nd generation, we identified a lead molecule, V1A-214, which showed substantially-improved binding affinity and
excellent target selectivity among all other major CNS targets. An 11C-isotopologue of V1A-214 was synthesized and
preliminary PET imaging studies confirmed that we have overcome two major obstacles for V1A-specific PET ligand
development by achieving: 1) high brain uptake (>1 SUV) and 2) high target specificity validated by human V1A cell
lines and blocking studies in vivo, and heterogenous uptake consistent with V1A regions in the CNS. Though V1A-
214 is a promising lead molecule for the development of new V1A-targeted PET ligands, due to species difference,
further optimization for translational cross-species (naïve/humanized V1A mice and nonhuman primates) imaging
studies are sought to achieve optimal AVP (V1A subunit) quantification in the living brain for drug discovery and clinical
biomarker for ASD patients.
 On the basis that V1A-214 serves a validated lead for medicinal chemistry optimization, as specific objectives, we
will design and prepare a focused library of V1A-specific antagonists amenable for labeling with 11C or 18F, and
evaluate their ability to quantify V1A-specific AVP activity and changes in cellular experiments, naïve and humanized
V1A mice and nonhuman primates, as well as autoradiography and biological validation in postmortem NHP/human
brain tissues. The impact of this work is not only to develop the first successful high-affinity and selective V1A-specific

10838760,"Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is a major driver of the HIV epidemic, but the underlying
biological mechanisms have not been delineated. Recurrent HSV-2 shedding, which occurs
more often in HIV-infected persons, is characterized by the recruitment and persistence of
CD4+ T cells and other immune cells at sites of HSV-2 reactivation as well as an increase in
activated CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood. These findings prompted us to test the
hypothesis that HSV-2 induces transcriptional changes in CD4+ T cells that promote HIV
replication and/or reactivation. We exposed primary CD4+ T cells or a latently HIV-infected T
cell line to HSV-2 and, using RNA sequencing, identified significant transcriptional changes
both in the HSV-2 infected and bystander cells. Importantly, the transcriptional changes were
associated with an increase in HIV replication and reactivation. One of the most significant
responses we observed in both HSV-2 infected and bystander cells was an increase in
expression of the long noncoding RNA, MALAT1. MALAT1 impacts the expression of multiple
transcripts including the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) through interactions with the
Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). We knocked out MALAT1 in an HIV-latently
infected cell line and showed that HIV latency reversal was significantly reduced but not
abolished when the knockout compared to the parental cells were infected with HSV-2.
Building on this foundation, we propose to further define MALAT1-mediated and identify
MALAT1-independent mechanisms by which HSV-2 promotes HIV replication and
reactivation. We will take advantage of a longitudinal biorepository of peripheral blood
mononuclear cells from people living with HIV and compare the responses to HSV-2 during
periods of HIV viremia and viral suppression. We will expose the cells to HSV-2 and conduct
single cell RNA sequencing, proteomic and histone analyses and determine how the cellular
responses to HSV-2 enhance HIV replication and promote HIV latency reversal. We will then
focus on changes at the site of HSV-2 reactivation using genital skin biopsies collected at the
time of an HSV outbreak (lesion and unaffected tissue) and after resolution in HIV-infected
and uninfected individuals. This will also allow us to assess interactions between different cell
types including epithelial cells, which are primary targets of HSV replication. We will use
cutting-edge high resolution spatial technologies to identify gene and protein expression in
the tissue. Results of these studies have great translational relevance and will identify new
targets to promote or prevent HIV latency reversal that can ultimately lead to HIV eradication."

The University of Miami (UM) CFAR is applying for its 4th competitive renewal under the continuing leadership
of Savita Pahwa, MD as Director, and Mario Stevenson, PhD as Co-Director. Our CFAR leaders complement
each other and bring diverse and distinctive perspectives to the forefront to develop a rich research environment
that is positioned to succeed in academia, community service, education and mentorship. The relevance of the
Miami CFAR is underscored by the fact that it is the only CFAR in Florida, the State with the highest rates of new
HIV infections in the country with Miami-Dade County (MDC) with the most new HIV diagnoses among counties.
The Administrative Core (Core A) of the Miami CFAR serves as the oversight branch of the CFAR and supports
the CFAR’s mission which is to advance HIV/AIDS research by providing scientific leadership and developing
an infrastructure that fosters integration of basic, clinical, and behavioral sciences, promotes education and
mentorship, engages the community and partners with the Florida Department of Health (FDOH) to prevent,
treat and cure HIV/AIDS, the ultimate aim being to end the HIV epidemic (EHE). The Specific Aims of Core A
are: Aim 1. Provide scientific leadership and establish lines of communication with School leadership and the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) and conform with National CFAR objectives and guidelines. Aim 2. Coordinate
activities of Cores, Scientific Interest Groups (SIGs) and the Scientific Working Group (SWG). Aim 3. Leverage
State resources and University of Miami Departments/Centers/Institutes for faculty recruitment and access to
additional resources. Aim 4. Sponsor educational activities, foster collaborations and establish linkages within
and outside campus. Aim 5. Organize internal and external advisory committees and grant reviews. The Internal
Advisory Committee (IAC) and External Advisory Committee (EAC) are essential resources and oversight
committees for the CFAR. The IAC members represent diverse experts who participate in the annual Strategic
Planning to make recommendations on the CFAR program. The EAC members are experts aligned to the Miami
CFAR priorities who provide critical review of the CFAR and both committees provide productive feedback
towards the larger program, infrastructure, scientific and research activities, and opportunities for advancement.
Aim 6. Establish policies and procedures and provide fiscal oversight for governance of the Miami CFAR. The
Miami CFAR has been able to mount a response to expand its impact through UM’s extensive clinical research
network and Core activities, bolstered by the EHE initiatives."
10851868,"Project Summary/Abstract (Developmental Core)
The Developmental Core supports the goals of the Miami CFAR through the following aims:
1. Maintain a program for solicitation, peer review and oversight of pilot grants that promotes the research of
 basic, clinical, and junior researchers to facilitate their path to successful extramural grants. Support will be
 targeted to: a) junior investigators; b) investigators new to HIV/AIDS research; c) translational research that
 fosters collaboration between basic and clinical researchers, including emerging opportunities; and d)
 research activities of newly recruited UM faculty working in HIV.
2. Maintain a vibrant and intensive mentoring program, the Mentoring Academy, that guides junior faculty,
 fellows and senior postdocs, and minority investigators, to successful independent careers.
The Developmental Core provides pilot funding and mentoring for investigators in order to obtain data to make
them more competitive for future independent funding in the field of HIV/AIDS from the NIH. The
Core encourages collaborations within the University of Miami and the other institutions in Florida. As the only
CFAR in Florida, Miami is able to offer funding in research opportunities to early-stage investigators (ESI) at
Florida institutions (Florida International University, University of Florida, Scripps) with a UM mentor. The
Mentoring Academy provides the CFAR with a program that trains mentors and mentees, guides ESI
in grant writing in an effort to outline a path to independent funding, and career development. The
Mentoring Academy will focus on developing the next generation of leaders for the CFAR. Funded ESI
have been appointed as Associate Directors to further establish their positions at the UM and in the
CFAR. The Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) supplements have formalized relationships between the
Developmental Core, community partners, and the Florida Department of Health (FDOH). The Core
leadership, Director Gwen Scott, MD, and Co-Director, Mario Stevenson, PhD, have excellent credentials in
NIH funding and reputation as quality directors at the UM Miller School of Medicine (MSOM). The Core’s
Co-Director of the Mentoring Academy, Adam Carrico, PhD, and Co-Leaders, Maria Alcaide, MD, and
Enrique Mesri, PhD bring experience in behavioral, clinical, basic and translational research. The Core will
continue to encourage researchers from underrepresented groups and high-risk populations in the
community in an effort to address and eliminate the health disparities that exist in South Florida. The
Developmental Core engages with the Administrative, Clinical Sciences, Laboratory Sciences, Bio-
Behavioral and Community Engagement Cores and the HIV and Aging Scientific Working Group in support
of the overall CFAR mission to provide awards that result in collaborations, publications, and successful
major grants in HIV/AIDS to end the HIV epidemic."
10851870,"Project Summary/Abstract (Clinical Sciences Core)
The CFAR Clinical Sciences Core (Core C) provides unique clinical resources and scientific leadership for the
largest network of HIV investigators in South Florida and promotes high impact HIV translational and
multidisciplinary human subjects research through partnerships with clinical, socio-behavioral, and basic
scientists. Under the leadership of Dr. Maria Alcaide (Core Director) and Dr. Charlie Mitchell (Co-Director), in
collaboration with the Biostatistical Sub-Core, Core C has supported over 70 investigators, 124 studies, and
almost 200 publications over the past 4 years. Core C has significantly contributed to the success of junior
investigators, including those from underrepresented groups and women. The success of Core C is strengthened
by strong institutional support for HIV research (one of the pillars of the University of Miami strategic plan for
research), and by facilitating the access to institutional programs not commonly supporting HIV research. The
specific aims for Core C are: Aim 1) To provide state-of-the-art facilities for implementing clinical and translational
studies, including support for rigorous clinical assessments, biological sample collection, and access to well-
characterized high-quality data. Core C supports fully equipped and staffed research static and mobile units, and
the development of CFAR databases; Aim 2) To provide research design methodology and technical assistance
to meet regulatory standards in research involving human subjects, human data, and biological specimens, and
to facilitate training/education of investigators in clinical research. Research methodology needed in key areas
will be provided by the highly qualified and experienced Core C investigators and staff, and training will be
accomplished by facilitating the use of institutional resources not commonly used by HIV investigators; and Aim
3) To provide biostatistical support throughout the project lifecycle, through the CFAR Biostatistics Sub-Core.
Core C biostatisticians will collaborate in planning study design for pilot studies, formulate statistical approaches
consistent with study aims, guide the development of data collection tools using electronic data entry systems,
support statistical analysis and interpretation, and participate in the development of manuscripts and grant
submissions. Without support from Core C research units, highly qualified clinical staff, robust databases and
biostatistical support; Miami CFAR investigators would not be able to conduct high impact multidisciplinary
research that will slow the progression of the epidemic in South Florida, and ultimately, end the HIV epidemic in
the US."

Core resources by leveraging institutional and external resources in order to be at the forefront of HIV/AIDS
research. In the current cycle (2017-2022), Core D has made tremendous progress, energized by new projects,
new technologies and new equipment. We remain cognizant of expectations from the users through periodic
needs assessment exercises, adequate Core utilization to support for projects of our funded research base
(FRB) and pilot awardees, mentorship to students and junior faculty, support research presentations at
conferences and establish linkages with other CFARs to maximize our capabilities for alignment with NIH
research priorities and advances in the field. For the next funding cycle, our goal is to provide needed services
to our investigator base while ensuring access to state-of-the-art technologies that drive innovation and help to
address key scientific questions in HIV/AIDS. Our specific Aims are: Aim 1. Serve as a one stop shop, that
allows investigators to easily access Immunology, Virology and Genomics services to meet both needs for high
demand assays as well as specialized assays that require dedicated expertise. Aim 2. Provide consultation,
training and technical assistance for investigators at all levels (from undergraduate students to established
investigators) to meet their needs for study design, generation of preliminary data and data for publications, and
to disseminate information about scientific advances in the field through special lectures and workshops in

10851873,"Project Summary/Abstract (Bio-Behavioral and Community Engagement Core)
The HIV epidemic in the South, in Florida in general, and Miami is of critical concern. This epidemic is fueled by
relatively low prevention, treatment, and other biomedical and public health resources. The Bio-Behavioral and
Community Engagement Core (Core E) will continue to identify and seek to alleviate structural and systemic
barriers that have long impacted the HIV treatment and prevention continua in our region. The overall aim of this
core is to advance the HIV treatment and prevention continua of care and the ending the HIV epidemic initiatives
in South Florida. We propose to do this by fostering the development, implementation, and evaluation of
innovative, inter-disciplinary bio-behavioral, social sciences and community-engaged research and initiatives
that are heuristically guided by a Social Ecological Model Framework; thus, recognizing the need to implement
multi-level HIV prevention and treatment strategies. Core E has established strong HIV-related community
collaborations that will continue to expand the implementation of evidence-based approaches to HIV prevention
and care such as the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Medical Center (UM/JMMC) Rapid Response Test
and Treat (TTRR); The University of Miami Research and Prevention of Infectious Diseases Program (RAPID);
The Infectious Diseases Elimination Act (IDEA Exchange); the Severe injection-related infection (SIRI) Team;
and the Transgender interest group. Core E has built extensive networks for effective community outreach and
engagement in the South Florida region. Core E will continue to provide scientific leadership and an infrastructure
that fosters integration and translation of behavioral, clinical, and basic research as well as expanding community
engagement in South Florida. These goals will be achieved through the following specific Aims: Aim 1. Provide
the necessary infrastructure to enable CFAR researchers to strategically advance the highest priority areas of
bio-behavioral investigation and inter-disciplinary collaboration among clinical, behavioral, social,
implementation and basic scientists. Aim 2. Promote active and meaningful bi-directional community
engagement by facilitating new and ongoing collaborations with Community Based Organizations (CBOs), Local
Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and the Florida Department of Health (FDOH) to ensure their
participation and input in the development, implementation, monitoring, analysis, interpretation, completion and
translation of behavioral and social science research. Aim 3. Facilitate recruitment and retention of study
participants for research addressing populations in the greatest need of behavioral approaches addressing the
HIV treatment and prevention continua of care and ending the HIV epidemic initiatives."

The long-term objectives of the Miami-CFAR HIV and Aging Scientific Working Group (HA-SWG) are to promote
innovative and emerging areas of research in HIV and aging through multidisciplinary collaborations. Since its
inception in February 2019, the HA-SWG is actively involved in research on mechanisms that address the
specific challenges that significantly impact our HIV-infected aging population in South Florida and beyond. Our
studies include evaluation of HIV-related comorbidities and immune dysfunction and their influence on frailty and
cognitive decline. The overall theme of multi-morbidity research serves to broaden the potential and scope of
our SWG. In this application, we are presenting a significantly modified SWG that was developed with a focus
on knowledge-based activities through the creation of working groups. These groups will study specific research
areas utilizing innovative approaches. The topic of metabolic regulation of the immune system in aging is under-
investigated and how HIV infection interacts with age-related metabolic reprogramming of immune cells and its
implications on the earlier onset of immune dysfunction and comorbidities demands further investigation. Our
current approach to understand the physical and cognitive frailty in aging persons living with HIV (PWH) has
translational relevance. The HA-SWG will further expand the scope of research in this area by investigating the
role of the gut-brain axis and liver-brain axis in the processes of neuroinflammation, accelerated neurocognitive
decline and cognitive frailty in aging PWH. Here we propose two specific aims of the HA-SWG. First, to develop
and promote innovative cross-disciplinary and collaborative translational research in the areas of immunology,
metabolic regulation, neuroinflammation, frailty and cardiovascular/liver co-morbidities. Second, we will develop
educational and mentoring activities within the University of Miami (UM) scientific community while enhancing
the research goals specified in Aim 1. By achieving these aims, the HA-SWG endeavors to create a platform for
interdisciplinary research at UM by bridging the clinical challenges of frailty, cognitive decline and comorbidities.
These efforts will also support basic science research studying the mechanisms underlying metabolic regulation
of immunity in HIV and Aging. The HA-SWG is also committed to create a resource-rich infrastructure to support
cross-disciplinary proposals related to HIV and aging, support Early Stage Investigators and researchers new to
the field of HIV research. To achieve our goals, the HA-SWG is uniquely positioned to leverage clinical and basic
research resources and expertise available to the Miami-CFAR and infrastructure available at UM through the
McKnight Brain Institute, Center on Neurocognitive Science and Aging, Comprehensive Center on Brain Health,
Clinical and Translational Science Institute, Diabetes Research Institute, Schiff Center for Liver Diseases and

The University of Hartford (UHart) is a mid-sized four-year institution of higher learning with a Carnegie
classification of Doctoral/Professional University. The current enrollment is 3,977 undergraduate students with
approximately 44% belonging to groups underrepresented in the biomedical sciences. In alignment with the
goals of the National Institutes of Health, UHart has strengthened its commitment to diversity and inclusivity by
investing in creating and sustaining a socially just community that supports student success.
The goal of the U-RISE program at UHart is to develop a group of diverse students who will become leaders in
biomedical research fields. We will achieve this goal through two specific aims: 1) To increase the number of
undergraduate UHart students from underrepresented backgrounds who are interested in pursuing
careers in biomedical research; and 2) To develop the research, critical thinking, and science
communication skills of U-RISE trainees. The U-RISE program at UHart will consist of a diverse curriculum
that includes Intramural Research training and one summer of Extramural Research training at high-ranking
ROI-funded institutions with faculty who are committed to the highest standards of rigor and transparency in
their research. Trainees and prospective trainees will also engage in Research Seminars, and Journal Clubs,
and complete a Techniques in Biomedical Research course. The training will culminate with the Capstone
activity that includes a thesis and research presentation. The U-RISE curriculum will be supplemented with
science outreach activities, as well as workshops on preparing graduate school applications and interview
skills. Together, these initiatives will facilitate the successful recruitment and training of diverse UHart
undergraduates and their subsequent matriculation into competitive Biomedical Ph.D. or MD/Ph.D. programs."
10848999,"ABSTRACT
Our training program for Interactionist Cognitive Neuroscience (ICoN) seeks to provide student-focused,
interdisciplinary training in computational cognitive neuroscience that integrates multiple levels of computation
and analysis with data across e scales and species. Such integration is key to making transformative gains in
understanding the human brain and mental health. Prior to launching the ICoN Training Program, we argued
that fulfilling this promise requires making direct links between circuit-level computation, often only testable in
animal models, and the emergent function of the human system (Badre, Frank and Moore, 2015 Neuron).
Bridging these levels does not happen spontaneously but demands a systematic approach that requires a new
generation of scientists who can take full advantage of computational theory and data at multiple levels from
cellular to systems to cognitive. Traditional neuroscience training relies on an apprenticeship model that limits
students to a single lab, and usually, a single level of inquiry. Cross-disciplinary training in this traditional model
comes with considerable risk and places an unusual burden on the individual student to forge a path. Thus, we
developed a specialized ICoN Training Program that facilitates the broad-based computational and
interdisciplinary training necessary to equip neuroscientists to be next generation leaders in the ‘Interactionist’
approach. ICoN program elements are based on two central tenets:
1. Computation is key to translating between levels. Students must be rigorously quantitatively trained and
versed in formal theory. They must be skilled in the languages, tools, and approaches of the computational
sciences, and fluent in advanced analysis methods necessary for cross-level integration.
2. Next-generation scholars must have expertise at multiple levels. Students must be trained to integrate
multiple methods and data sources from animal to human, molecule to mind. They must have the skills (and
courage) to pursue ideas to their next most logical step, to be question-driven and not technique-limited. Students
must be versed in multiple scientific literatures, cultures, and vocabularies.
To achieve these tenets, the ICoN program provides a variety of training opportunities that are tailored to
individual student goals through team advising. Building on the success of the initial funding period, program
elements include: cross-level research experiences bridging domains such as human cognitive, system, and
computational neuroscience; weekly ICoN group meetings, with intensive discussion on merits and challenges
of Interactionist science; formal coursework; intensive computational and experimental workshops; and career
development training opportunities. The cross-disciplinary training and collaborations ICoN provides will
accelerate the pace of discovery in mental health research and ultimate translation to real world impact."
10896313,"Abstract
Hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors (HSPCs) are a rare population of self-renewing bone marrow (BM)
cells that can generate all mature lineage blood cells for the lifespan of an organism. In adults, quiescent HSPCs
reside within a hypoxic bone marrow niche (1-4% O2 physiologic hypoxia) and are capable of rapidly entering
the cell cycle and differentiate to produce leukocytes in response to an invading pathogen. The mentor’s lab
uncovered that resolution of inflammation is governed by spatial and temporal production of novel mediators and
elucidated the specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), a superfamily of autacoids that includes lipoxins (LX),
resolvins (Rv), protectins (PD), and maresins (MaR). SPM biosynthesis structures and functions were
established in the mentor’s lab and confirmed by others. SPMs are sub-nanomolar potent, stereoselective
agonists that promote microbial clearance and containment, while enhancing host survival by accelerating host
resolution mechanisms. This proposal is based on new findings from work in progress; we identified, using state-
of-the-art metabololipidomics profiling, a specific SPM cluster in HSPC under physiologic hypoxia, which includes
Resolvin D1 (RvD1), Resolvin D4 (RvD4), Resolvin E1 (RvE1), Maresin 1 (MaR1) and Lipoxin B4 (LXB4). Also,
we recently identified a new SPM, Resolvin E4 (RvE4), in healthy human bone marrow. Tissues that experience
physiologic hypoxic niches, such as BM, have high amounts of SPMs through undefined mechanisms. Thus, we
propose to rigorously test the following hypothesis: In physiologic hypoxia, specialized pro-resolving
mediators (SPMs) produced in BM are essential for regulating HSPC responses de novo and/or during
infection at distal sites of invasion, as well as maintaining BM homeostasis. The following aims are
proposed by using state-of-the-art omics platforms e.g., metabolipidomics (LC-MS/MS), mass cytometry
(CyTOF) and single cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNA-seq) in murine and human HSPCs to: 1) determine the impact
of physiologic hypoxia on endogenous novel SPM production in BM niche (K99), and 2) establish the regulation
of HSPC differentiation and responses to infection by the SPM cluster, specifically RvD1, RvD4, MaR1 and the
novel RvE4 (K99/R00). The K99 mentored phase will take place at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard
Medical School under the mentorship of two internationally recognized scientists, Professor Charles N. Serhan,
the leader in the structural elucidation of SPMs and their functions and Professor Leonardo Zon, the leader on
hematopoiesis. Dr. Libreros will be further advised by a scientific committee/collaborator covering different
aspects of the research proposal: Dr. Matthew Spite, Dr. Mark Perrella, and Professor David Scadden. The goal
of this proposal is to provide a comprehensive scientific and career development plan for the applicant with the
required skills to transition to an independent faculty position (R00). Results from these studies will yield
fundamentally new insights into the functions of SPMs and novel pro-resolving pathways in HSPC biology.
These discoveries can help develop novel treatments for hematological disorders and provide a basic
understanding of how bone marrow supports resolution programs during infections."
10849426,"Project Summary
DNA replication is thought to have evolved twice, independently, in Bacteria and Archaea/Eukarya, as the
principal components of the replication machinery such as the replicative helicase and the DNA polymerases
are not evolutionarily related in the two branches of life. Initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication occurs in G1
phase of the cell cycle, when the initiator Cdc6 binds and activates the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) to
recruit Cdt1-bound Mcm2-7 hexamer, thereby assembling an inactive Mcm2-7 double-hexamer on double
stranded DNA and establishing the pre-Replication Complex (pre-RC). At G1-to-S transition, the Mcm2-7
double-hexamer is converted to two active replicative helicases, the Cdc45-Mcm2-7-GINS (CMG) complexes.
The CMG helicase and the Ctf4 trimer serve as the hubs to nucleate a replisome to synthesize DNA. Advances
in in vitro reconstitutions of origin activation, leading strand and lagging strand DNA synthesis, along with the
cryo-EM resolution revolution, have made it feasible to visualize a replisome and tackle the complex replication
mechanism. In the previous funding cycle, we have elucidated how Cdc6 binds ORC to activate it and enhance
origin specificity, how ORC-Cdc6 recruits and loads Mcm2-7 onto origin DNA in a multi-step process, and how
the CMG helicase unwinds DNA duplex at a fork. We have determined the complete structures of all three
major enzymes at the replication fork – the leading strand polymerase Pol ε, the lagging strand polymerase Pol
δ, and the polymerase-primase complex Pol α. Furthermore, we have revealed entirely unexpected loading
mechanisms of the PCNA and 9-1-1 DNA clamps by the clamp loaders RFC and Rad24-RFC, respectively.
We have shown how the yeast Yta7 ATPase hexamer disrupts the nucleosome ahead of the replication fork
and how the T4 phage helicase hexamer assembles with the primase to form a functional primosome to
synthesize a 5-nucleotide RNA primer. Building on these successes, the PI proposes to continue the
collaborative and mechanistic study on the replication origin activation mechanism and the replisome
architecture. The proposed research is significant because DNA replication is central to cellular growth, and
dysregulation of replication leads to uncontrolled proliferation and tumorigenesis."

level, cross-disciplinary, team science training that spans the translational research gamut from animal models
to population-based approaches to solutions to curb or halt drug addiction. With program priorities of training
innovation, diversity, connectivity, and outcomes, this renewal seeks further support for a program of training
excellence that is dynamic and evolving in response to the rapidly changing societal, legislative, research,
clinical, and community responses to addiction. The program Co-Directors, Governance and Steering
Committees, and external evaluators/advisers enact the roles of program administration, connectivity, and
oversight. A program evaluation plan is based on progress towards eight training objectives: (1) foster a shared
knowledge of the broad societal and health impacts of drug use disorders, and of the diversity of engaged
scientific disciplines, (2) provide an individualized path to diverse addiction impact career areas and maximize
post-training outcomes, (3) foster diversity as a strength for maximizing program impact, (4) provide career
building environments emphasizing interdisciplinary, team science, and translational research, (5) innovate
advances in training approaches to research ethics, professional development, and program connectivity, (6)
enhance awareness of and impact on translational outcomes, (7) evaluate both bibliometric and translational
science benefit outcomes of the program, and (8) foster the engagement of physicians and other clinicians in
the career building processes of the program. A Progress Report details significant outcomes for each
objective; quantitative and qualitative data support the claim of program excellence in the current funding cycle.
Continued support is requested for three levels of trainees involving three predoctoral students, four
postdoctoral fellows, and four annual M2 summer addiction research interns, complemented by institutional
support of one annual PGY3 psychiatry resident. Program-wide courses, faculty-facilitated seminar and
presentation series, professional development lectures and workshops, and elective mentored research
training emphasis/impact areas would support translational research training opportunities across the spectrum
of T1 to T4 translational science. Mechanisms of trainee and program evaluation will focus on both scientific
bibliometric and translational human health and society benefit indicators of program impact. Other feedback-
driven new initiatives will include a redesigned grant writing skill development course and workshop, as well as
a well-developed leadership succession plan. Significant institutional commitment and resources support the
accrued value and continued success of the training program."
10848771,"We propose a flexible interdisciplinary Training Program in Cell and Molecular Biology – the Cell and Molecular
Biology Training Grant (CMBTG) – at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). The CMBTG is a University-wide,
interdepartmental and interschool program whose mission is to provide a multifaceted doctoral program to
prepare students for research-focused and/or research-related careers in cell and molecular biology in
academia, industry, or government. The goals of the CMBTG are (1) to provide Trainees with both in-depth and
broad-based training in cell and molecular biology research and modern methodology, while at the same time
matching the Trainees’ specific interests, and (2) endow students with an appreciation for life-long learning in
which they can adapt to shifting research needs within the cell and molecular biology fields. These goals are
achieved through general and specialized courses, literature survey courses, laboratory rotations, a qualifying
examination, thesis research with oversight from an advising committee and annual IDP submission, training in
responsible conduct of research and scientific rigor and reproducibility, and training grant-specific activities.
Trainee-specific activities include: an annual oral presentation of ongoing thesis research; attending the annual
Cell and Molecular Biology Graduate Group Retreat; attending the Annual Trainee Organized Invited Lectures
and meeting with the speakers; participating in Alumni Day designed to expose Trainees to a broad range of
PhD-dependent careers; Current and Former Trainee Lunch in which former Trainees present a talk on their
thesis research; Senior student mentored prepration of individual fellowships; Interactions with Pennovation
Works, a business incubator and laboratory that aligns and integrates researchers, innovators, and
entrepreneurs for the commercialization of research discoveries; and other activities. Trainees also work on
presentation skills, including elevator talks, and learn how to write, defend, and review grants productively.
Students completing their first year of graduate studies are appointed for two years and are selected annually
by the Executive Committee. Trainers come from multiple Departments within the Penn Schools of Medicine,
Veterinary Medicine, and Arts and Science, and affiliated Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the Wistar
Institute. Trainers have active research programs in cell and molecular biology and a strong commitment to
graduate education. The CMBTG has formal mechanisms to monitor Trainees both during and after CMBTG
support and to train Trainers in mentorship and unconscious bias and monitor them. Lastly, Trainers participate
in a number of efforts to recruit under-represented students both locally and nationally. The CMBTG is directly
managed by an Executive Committee that sets and reviews policy and selects Trainees. Based on the number
of potential trainees, we request support for 10 predoctoral trainees/year for the next 5 years."
10852874,"Bone is the most frequently targeted site for PCa metastasis as opposed to soft tissues
site. The reason for this selectivity is unknown but the bone microenvironment, including
osteoblast and osteoclast activity, have been show to promote PCa growth. Osteocytes
(OCys), which respond to pressure through mechanotransduction, are the most common cell in
bone (>90% of bone cells). However, the role of OCys in progression of PCa bone metastasis
has not been elucidated. We have now identified that PCa cells, through soluble factors,
educate OCys to produce Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), which stimulates PCa cell
invasion and growth. We further identified that PCa cells express the novel GDF-15 receptor,
GDFN family receptor alpha-like precursor (GFRAL), which has not been explored in cancer
and thus, how it contributes to metastasis is a gap of knowledge.
 In addition to directly targeting the PCa cells, GDF15 has been shown to target the
microenvironment and induce osteoclast (OCl) production and subsequent bone resorption
which can promote seeding and growth of PCa in bone and we identified that osteoclasts
express GFRAL.
 Furthermore, we previously identified that the bone microenvironment confers a
chemoresistant phenotype to bone and have preliminary data suggesting that the
GDF15:GFRAL contributes to the phenotype. Taken together, these findings lead us to
hypothesize that PCa-educated OCys promote PCa bone metastasis through the
GDF15:GFRAL axis. We will explore this hypothesis through the following aims:
Aim 1. Determine the role of GFRAL signaling on cellular function in PCa bone
metastasis.
Aim 2. Determine if OCys promote bone metastasis through GDF15:GFRAL axis
 activation of osteoclasts.
Aim 3. Identify mechanisms through which GFRAL promotes chemoresistance in bone.
We believe these studies will provide a new understanding of the role of OCys and GFRAL in
PCa bone metastasis and identify novel therapeutic targets."

While effective treatments exist, and substantial new funding has been distributed to states and territories to
expand access, the US continues to be plagued with opioid and stimulant related deaths. Nonlethal overdoses,
emergency room and hospitalization utilization also continue to escalate. Research Project 1 proposes to
develop an innovative model-driven decision support system to aid counties to prioritize and optimize the use
of available resources to address opioid and stimulant deaths. This new implementation strategy differs from
and extends data-driven decision making, which by itself does not produce information on projected impact. In
particular, this system examines a multitude of different options for implementation strategies that fit a county’s
needs and capacities, and identifies optimal solutions that are robust to changing contexts. This model-driven
decision support (MDDS) implementation strategy integrates three components: 1) an ongoing community-
research partnership, which is essential if decision makers are to feel the predictions are locally relevant and
trustworthy; 2) integrated administrative, interview, and survey data, which are required to account for the
locally unique contextual factors; and 3) a modular agent-based model (ABM) that integrates data, represents
alternative implementation strategies, and simulates their behavior on overdose deaths under varying
conditions. The first aim focuses on extending an existing ABM that takes as input local data and produces
projections across diverse strategies’ impact on overdose deaths and disparities. Response surface
methodology and mediation modeling are used to summarize findings. Front-end tools are developed along
with training so the system can be used by other counties. The second aim examines the generalizability of
this approach in three diverse counties: Pinellas County FL, Vermilion County IL, and Santa Clara County CA.
We have active partnerships with all three communities. If there is no change in mortality in these 3 counties,
more than 3,000 individuals are expected to die from overdose in the coming 5 years. The third aim focuses on
advancing an approach for improving care through monitoring and feedback, both within these communities
and across using a learning collaborative. This aim also formally evaluates the MDDS using the Stages of
Implementation Completion (SIC) as well as measuring acceptability and the degree to which the communities
are using this approach differently from one based on data only. At the PREPARE phase of the implementation
process, Research Project 1 is bi-directionally integrated with C-DIAS, and uses common measures with the
other C-DIAS Research Projects. In pursuit of C-DIAS specific aim 2, in concert with the Research Core, this
project will serve as a vehicle to test and advance ABM and cost modeling decision supports for policymakers
and implementation endeavors nationwide. Project findings will be widely influential because of C-DIAS
dissemination platforms, including open science assess to ABM tools, resulting in greater impact than
otherwise possible if conducted independently."
10853072,"C-DIAS RESEARCH PROJECT 2: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This rigorous experiment addresses a critical public health problem--the rising stimulant/opioid epidemic. It
advances implementation science through the evaluation of a multi-level implementation strategy and specifies
of contextual determinants of outcomes. Stimulants constitute a new and deadly fourth wave of the opioid
epidemic. Among persons with opioid use disorder, stimulant use has been associated with more persistent
opioid use; higher risk of HIV infection; higher levels of family, medical, legal, and vocational problems; and
higher risk of lethal overdose. Contingency management (CM) is the most effective intervention for stimulant
use and is an evidence-based adjunct to medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Yet, uptake of CM in
opioid treatment programs (OTPs) that provide MOUD remains low: in fact, access to CM is arguably one of
the greatest research-to-practice gaps in the addiction treatment services field. The goal of C-DIAS Research
Project 2 is to conduct a type III hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate a multi-level
implementation strategy, the Science to Service Laboratory (SSL), to install CM for stimulant use in OTPs. The
SSL has three core components: didactic training; performance feedback; and external facilitation. The project
employs common C-DIAS frameworks, measures, and methods to guide SSL evaluation. Utilizing a stepped
wedge design, a regional cohort of 10 public sector OTPs will be randomized to receive SSL at five distinct
time points. At six intervals, each of the 10 OTPs will provide data from all available patient charts on CM
delivery and patient outcomes. Each OTP will also recruit 10 patients per wedge (n = 500 patients) to complete
a baseline interview and 3-month follow-up. In addition, staff from each OTP will report on contextual
determinants of implementation outcomes at three timepoints. This study will rigorously evaluate whether a
multi-level implementation strategy developed by one of the longest-standing national intermediary purveyor
organizations--the SAMHSA Technology Transfer Centers, will improve both implementation and patient
outcomes. Implementation outcomes are guided by RE-AIM and include CM Reach, Adoption, Implementation
and Sustainment, while patient outcomes include measures of CM Effectiveness such as stimulant abstinence
and treatment retention. The study will advance the C-DIAS scientific aims by unpacking the black box of
implementation strategies and exploring the mediational and moderating influence of context on
implementation outcomes. Focused on the active IMPLEMENT phase, this Research Project leverages a bi-
directional synergistic relationship with C-DIAS. Some but not all examples of this include: 1) standardized
measures of implementation context, outcomes and procedural details of strategies; 2) PI (Becker)’s role on
the C-DIAS Research Core; 3) a close network of collaboration and mentoring among the key project
personnel and C-DIAS PI; and 4) harmonization of data that can be used for modeling by C-DIAS Research
Core experts."
10853073,"C-DIAS RESEARCH PROJECT 3: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
At the SUSTAIN phase, C-DIAS Research Project 3 addresses a critical scientific and public health gap: How
can we improve equity when offering digital treatments to patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) in
primary care? A wide range of effective digital treatments —app or web-based interventions—for SUDs and
comorbid conditions are available for use in primary care, and many have been evaluated in diverse
populations. Digital treatments for SUDs could potentially reduce inequities, as they: 1) have the potential to
reach more people by reducing access barriers; 2) can circumvent SUD stigma; and 3) allow patients to initiate
interventions from the comfort and privacy of home. At the same time, digital treatments may also magnify
inequities due to factors stemming from the “digital divide.” We will rigorously evaluate an implementation
strategy to “scale-out” digital treatments to disadvantaged populations as an approach to potentially improve
equity in digital care for people with SUDs, and as a model for how to ethically sustain digital treatments in
real-world healthcare. Prior pragmatic trials found that evidence-based practices and other initiatives are hard
to sustain without leadership and clinic buy-in, so our multi-level study design and analytic plan focuses on
these issues. Our delivery system partners in Kaiser Permanente Washington are committed to collaborating
with us to study multi-level strategies for scaling-out existing digital treatments in 32 primary care clinics in
Washington State to address expected equity challenges. All clinics will receive a 3-part system-level set of
implementation strategies that are suitable for primary care: 1) system-wide audit and feedback; 2) patient
stories from members of disadvantaged populations; and, 3) engaging key stakeholders in problem solving to
reduce barriers to the use of digital treatments among disadvantaged populations. To test a clinic-level
implementation strategy, a subset of 12 clinics will be randomized to receive external facilitation or to a control
condition (no facilitation) in a 1:1 parallel-groups design. Equity outcomes will be assessed by comparing reach
across subgroups of patients defined by key social determinants (e.g., race/ethnicity). Specific Aims are to: 1)
estimate the impact of a multi-level implementation strategy (system- and clinic-level) in increasing equity in
the reach of digital treatments among patients with SUD in primary care clinics; and 2) describe the costs of
and adherence to the implementation strategies, and examine how contextual determinants can impact equity
in implementation and patient outcomes. Research Project 3 leverages a bi-directional relationship with C-
DIAS, demonstrated in part by: 1) standardized measures of implementation context, outcomes and procedural
details of strategies; 2) PI (Glass)’s role on the C-DIAS Research Core; 3) a close network of collaboration and
mentoring among the key project personnel and C-DIAS PI; 4) harmonization of data that can be used for
modeling by C-DIAS Research Core experts; 5) data on digital treatment implementation costs for decision-
makers; and 6) expanded options for dissemination and impact of study findings through C-DIAS."
10853860,"Project Summary/Abstract
One central paradox in the initiation of allergic immunity is that although dendritic cells are necessary for the
initiation of allergic immune responses, dendritic cells are activated in vivo by allergen immunization, but not
directly in vitro by allergens. This indicates that another cell may act upstream of dendritic cells to act as the
initial allergen sensor. Our long-term goal is to understand how the innate immune system is activated by
allergens to initiate the allergic immune response. Given that 40% of the United States population suffers from
one or more allergic diseases and that the prevalence of allergic disease continues to increase worldwide, we
believe there is an urgent health need to understand how allergic diseases are initiated. We recently found that
sensory neurons are directly activated by allergens in vivo and in vitro, leading to the release of Substance P
that activates the migration of Th2-skewing dendritic cells through their expression of MRPGPRA1. Our central
hypothesis is that sensory neurons are the initial sensors of allergens and that their interactions with innate
immune cells both promote sensory neuronal responsiveness to allergens and allows sensory neurons to
initiate the allergic immune response. Building upon recent breakthroughs detailing sensory neurons involved
in allergen sensing, dendritic cell subsets that respond to allergens, and mechanisms of allergic-skewing
dendritic cell migration, we propose to integrate tools of cellular immunology and neurobiology to gain a
fundamental understanding of neuroimmune interactions that promote allergic immune activation. Using these
tools, we propose to test our central hypothesis in two specific aims: (1) determine the mechanisms by which
allergen-stimulated sensory neurons interact with and initiate dendritic cell activation, and (2) identify how  T
cells control sensory neuron activation by allergens. Aim 1 will examine the interactions between sensory
neurons and dendritic cells, and the requirement for Substance P and MRGPRA1 in these interactions. Aim 2
will address how a novel subset of dermal  T cells may endow or promote the responsiveness of sensory
neurons to allergens. These studies will lay the groundwork for the development of therapeutic strategies to
prevent initial allergic sensitization (Aim 1), treat chronic itch diseases (Aim 2), and prevent polysensitization in
patients with pre-existing allergic disease (Aims 1 & 2)."
10853085,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 10% of pregnant women give birth preterm In the United States and worldwide, which not only
results in a high rate of fetal mortality but also puts the children at a lifelong risk of negative health consequences
such as cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and visual and hearing impairments. Despite years of research, the
mechanisms of initiation and propagation of uterine contractions resulting in preterm labor and birth remain
unknown. In large part, this is because of our limited ability to monitor the human uterine contractions with
sufficient spatial and temporal resolutions. This leads to a lack of critical knowledge of the pathologic factors that
alter the normal uterine maturation, initiate preterm labor, and result in preterm birth. In order to address this
unmet clinical and research need, our team has recently developed a novel high-resolution and noninvasive
electromyometrial imaging (EMMI) system, which uses up to 256 unipolar electrodes to measure uterine
electrograms from the patient's abdomen surface and then combines the patient-specific body-uterus geometry
obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to generate accurate and robust three-dimensional maps of
uterine electrical activity during contractions. Because such a powerful experimental tool could permit closer and
more precise study of birth-related risks and improve maternal and child outcomes, we believe there could be a
significant clinical impact for us to develop a low-cost, wireless, and wearable version in order to make this
imaging technology more accessible for outpatient or in-home monitoring settings.
 We propose to develop and validate the functionality of a unique wearable EMMI system with printed
disposable electrodes, wireless power delivery, and telemetry for continuously monitoring of the uterine
contraction activities in ambulatory patients. The proposed research activity will involve developing of ultrathin
soft sensor patches with printed stretchable electrodes for recording high quality electrograms from the patient’s
abdomen and generating accurate and robust 3D maps of the uterine surface; investigating and designing a
novel self-capacitance based wireless power transfer instrumentation for wirelessly powering all the sensing and
telemetry circuits at each recording site in a fully distributed high-density imaging system; validating the wireless
and wearable EMMI system in human subjects and benchmarking its performance against “gold standard” wired
EMMI system. Upon successful completion of this study, the entirely new wearable, wireless, and batteryless
imaging system developed in the project will facilitate EMMI's clinical translations, allow it to be used outside the
delivery room for outpatient setting or in-home monitoring applications, and ultimately enable us to leverage the
electrical mapping data for evaluating uterine electrical maturation and contraction patterns during pregnancy
and labor and use the results to better understand and treat preterm birth."

Risk Factors and Prevention). Consistent with PA-20-186 (Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient Oriented
Research [POR]), I propose to continue protecting 25% of my time to augment my capabilities in POR, and
provide mentoring to junior clinical investigators in the conduct of POR. The current K24 supported scientific
project and its related mentoring and training activities has leveraged grant R01AG050440 (Diabetes Status and
Brain Amyloid in Middle Aged Hispanics; PI: Luchsinger). The current K24 award proposed the examination of
plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), metabolomics, and a pilot study of tau Positron Emission
Tomography (PET), which were successfully achieved while providing mentoring and resources to several early
investigators, who have successfully obtained K and R funding. R01AG050440 will be renewed for another 5
years on 08/01/21 for another 5 years of funding, and will be leveraged again for the scientific, training, and

imaging [MRI]) and plasma biomarkers (Aß42/40 ratio, neurofilament light, ptau-181) for two more waves, in
addition to comprehensive cognitive testing and ascertainment of cerebrovascular disease (CVD). Preliminary
data shows that microgliosis (neuroinflammation) accompanies neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in
diabetic (db/db) mice. Thus, I propose to train in neuroinflammation and its measurement in humans, including
plasma Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) and, brain imaging (11C-ER176 PET), and apply them to the parent
study during the proposed period. The overarching hypothesis of this application is that diabetes causes
neuroinflammation that leads to neurodegeneration and associated cognitive deficits, independent of amyloid,
tau, and CVD. My primary scientific aim is to examine the association of neuroinflammation, ascertained with
plasma GFAP, with neurodegeneration, ascertained as cortical thickness on brain MRI, and memory impairment,
ascertained as total recall in the Buschke Selective Reminding Test. My first training aim 1: to train in the role of
neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases and in diabetes, its measurement in plasma, and its
interpretation. My first mentoring aim is to train mentees in the primary (amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration) and
secondary constructs (cognition, CVD) of the NIA/AA research framework, and their potential relation to diabetes
and other cardiometabolic risk factors for AD/ADRD. My secondary scientific aim is to conduct a pilot study of
brain imaging with the 18kDA translocator protein (TSPO) ligand 11C-ER-176 in 20 participants in the parent

Structural dynamics and energy landscapes of G protein signaling
Project Summary (Abstract)
Extracellular signals like hormones and neurotransmitters use G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) to activate
multiple signaling pathways inside the cells. GPCR‐mediated signaling is involved in many physiological
processes, making them attractive therapeutic targets in a broad range of disease areas that affect metabolic,
nervous, cardiovascular, and immune systems, to name a few. These receptors have emerged as dynamic
signaling machines controlled by their ligands, where each receptor can potentially signal through a specific or
multiple heterotrimeric G proteins and each ligand is capable of signaling through multiple G proteins by
binding to G protein‐selective receptors. In addition, these receptors also utilize G protein independent signaling
pathways mediated by other transducer proteins like arrestins. The receptors are no longer considered simple
on‐off switches due to their complex signaling profiles. The heterotrimeric G proteins have emerged as maestro
controllers of receptor‐mediated signaling, capable of coupling as heterotrimers to receptors that results in G
protein dissociation into G and G subunits, which can couple to downstream effectors (like adenylyl cyclases,
phospholipases, ion channels, or receptor kinases) and to regulators (like RGS proteins ‐ regulators of G protein
signaling). This signaling control by G proteins is orchestrated via conformational changes triggered by binding
to receptors, GDP/GTP‐exchange, dissociation into G and G subunits, GTP hydrolysis, and binding to RGS
proteins. G proteins have also been shown to couple with some receptors unproductively, i.e., no GDP/GTP
exchange or G protein activation takes place. This proposal leverages the experimental structures available for
a handful of G protein conformations and uses computational approaches like molecular dynamics to provide a
mechanistic basis for G protein activation. The main objectives in this proposal aim to determine the structural
determinants and thermodynamic landscapes for G protein coupling with the receptors that causes GDP release,
their dissociation from the receptors after GDP‐GTP exchange, and the effect of ligands on their constitutive
activity. These computational studies will be complemented with experimental biophysical and biochemical
methods and will provide unprecedented mechanistic insight into molecular determinants of G protein
activation."
10844738,"Project Summary. This proposal requests funds to acquire a new micro Positron Emission and Computed
Tomography (micro-PET/CT) imaging system for investigators conducting cutting-edge preclinical molecular
imaging research at Emory University. PET is a medical technique that creates images of biochemical processes
occurring in vivo, where radioactive molecules (also known as PET ligands) are injected and the distributions of
those molecules are measured using a PET scanner. The unique detection physics of PET permit the creation
of images that are fully quantitative and capable of assessing metabolism, protein binding, receptor density,
blood flow, cellular synthesis and other biological processes. Emory has a well-established Center for Systems
Imaging Core (CSIC), which is an NIH-supported core laboratory with a comprehensive supporting
radiochemistry facility including discovery laboratories, radiopharmacy and an on-site cyclotron. The CSIC
strives to develop and apply breakthrough imaging approaches in translational and clinically meaningful ways.
Our continuing success relies on the integration of new and emerging technologies into our existing research
imaging platform; however, our current small-animal PET/CT scanner is obsolete and at high risk of becoming
inoperable due to service and parts discontinuation of the manufacturer.
 We propose to purchase a state-of-art PET/CT imaging system, which offers an innovative, high-
performance with improved spatial resolution and sensitivity at lower cost. One integrated micro-PET/CT platform
with precision machining of the animal bed assure smooth transition while fully automatic image co-registration
fuses images with micrometer precision. Physiological monitoring of rats and mice is assured through respiratory,
body temperature and cardiac gating. The proposed imaging system will be housed at the CSIC and managed
by a team of expert technical faculty and administrative staff that are highly experienced in operating NIH-
supported core facilities. A complete organizational plan is presented with strong institutional support to take full
advantage of the proposed instrument and core resources. The new micro-PET/CT will be an important resource
not only for many currently funded biomedical imaging research projects, including studies on neurodegenerative
disorders and brain function, cancer, cardiovascular and infectious diseases, but also become an invaluable
imaging platform to develop new innovative, interdisciplinary and translational research at the Emory research
community, as well as at other institutions in the greater Atlanta area."
10847520,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cytokines represent a broad range of small signaling proteins utilized by immune cells in cell-to-cell
communications. Dysregulated cytokine release contributes to acute and long-term conditions, from life-
threatening cytokine release syndrome to delayed wound healing. Targeting the cytokine release is an
attractive strategy because it can regulate multiple cytokines involved in complex diseases. However, no FDA-
approved drugs target this process, and related clinical trials remain scarce. The lack of clinical translation
represents an urgent need to develop advanced technologies to better understand the cytokine release
process at the molecular level. To date, existing assays for cytokine quantification, such as ELISA and flow
cytometry, provide a low resolution that masks detailed mechanistic information in space and time. By
capitalizing on the PI’s unique expertise in immune imaging, the R35 proposal will address this need by
developing ultrasensitive cytokine quantification techniques using T cells and interleukin-2 as a model system.
Cytokine quantification will be achieved in three specific areas: 1) at the resolution of single-vesicle fusion
events with the plasma membrane, 2) at the nanoscale membrane release sites, and 3) in the membrane-
enclosed form of extracellular vesicles (EVs). Enhanced mechanistic understanding will be obtained at the
single-cell level regarding the temporal and directional profiles of cytokine release, proximity-based regulation
by membrane calcium channels, and the dynamic distribution between soluble and EV-associated cytokines
during T cell activation. Each of these areas will potentially enable compound screening targeting specific
spatial and temporal phenotypes, investigations of membrane channel inhibitors, and targeting EVs for
cytokine modulation. Future studies will be expanded to other essential cytokines from adaptive and innate
immune cells. Ultrasensitive quantification of cytokines will enhance mechanistic understanding of the cytokine
release in search of novel membrane targets to modulate the process."
10847522,"Late onset neurodegenerative diseases together affect more than 7 million Americans with associated
healthcare costs currently reach hundreds of billions of dollars per year. Cognitive decline is a common feature
of many of these diseases, especially Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and vascular dementia. In
spite of exciting progress being made in studying those disorders, currently, there are no available
therapeutics capable of improving cognition. Therefore, it came as a surprise when a set of observations from
a few labs, including ours, supported the notion that recovery of brain function after damage to the CNS might
be achievable. Much of the data was obtained from studies of heterochronic parabiotic mice – young and old
mice whose circulatory systems had been surgically joined. Our additional studies were equally exciting in that
they demonstrated that injection of a single factor, GDF11, a normal serum protein, into aged mice was also
able to improve important properties of the CNS. Specifically, GDF11 stimulated neurogenesis, increased
neural activity and improved vascular structure. Surprisingly, we found that GDF11 does not cross the blood-
brain barrier and instead may exert its effects by acting directly on aging brain vasculature. This proposal
focuses on understanding in much greater detail how GDF11 exerts these ameliorative effects on the CNS.
First, we will use a combination of histological, molecular and transcriptomic methods to investigate the effects
of GDF11 on the cells of the brain more broadly. We will employ several measures including markers of neural
activity, neurogenesis, angiogenesis, as well as changes in gene expression of the different cell types, and we
will determine the sequence of GDF11’s actions (testing the hypothesis that GDF11’s neural effects are
indirect and follow direct effects on brain vasculature). Next, we will compare GDF11’s effects on cells of the
CNS with effects of other TGFβ-family ligands such as GDF8, TGFβ2 and modified forms of GDF11.
Identifying the most effective ligand will help us understand the molecular changes these ligands produce, as
well as position us to develop effective therapeutics in the future. Finally, our unpublished findings show that
GDF11 and the components of its signaling pathway are expressed by multiple brain cell types well into
adulthood. We will compare and contrast the functions of systemically injected GDF11 with those of GDF11
acting from within the brain. We will use a combination of histology and genetic perturbation to quantify the
expression of GDF11 and its receptors across various regions the brain and how they are altered by aging. We
will then measure the consequences of reducing brain GDF11 on neurogenesis and neural function. This will
provide a better understanding of what might happen if systemic GDF11 gained direct access to neural cells in
diseases in which the blood-brain barrier becomes compromised. From this work, we hope to gain a
comprehensive understanding of the effects of GDF11, how they relate to those of other TGFβ-family ligands,
and what benefits to brain function may be achieved by administering these factors."

Gains or losses of transcription factor binding at specific locations in the genome have been linked to a wide
range of human diseases. Despite our knowledge about the determinants of transcription factor-DNA
interaction, it is still challenging to accurately predict changes in transcription factor binding due to genetic and
epigenetic variants in the genome. Several critical gaps remain in our understanding of the integration of
sequence and non-sequence information on endogenous genomic DNA that give rise to the genome-wide
binding patterns of transcription factors. Our long-term vision is to shed light on how genome and epigenome
variation, which leads to variation in the genome-wide targets of transcription factors, affects the regulatory
networks of the cell, and the gene expression programs that give rise to phenotypic diversity.
 Our previous study characterized the genome-wide binding locations of more than 500 transcription factors
in Arabidopsis thaliana on the reference genome. Our integrative computational analysis revealed the features
of endogenous genome context, consisting of sequence motif, DNA shape, and 5-methylcytosine modification
of genomic DNA, that play a role in determining the binding landscape of transcription factors of major
structural families. To further study the variability of these binding sites, driven by native genome and
epigenome variation, we generated genome-wide, base-resolution maps of 5-methylcytosine, an epigenomic
mark on DNA, in a collection of over 1,000 world-wide, natural strains (accessions) of A. thaliana,
complementing the efforts to catalog genome sequence variation in these accessions. Guided by the diversity
in the genome and epigenome, a wealth of phenotypic data, and preliminary results suggesting transcription
factor binding variation in these accessions, our goals for the next five years are to address three major
challenges in understanding natural variation in transcription factor binding: 1) to determine the genome-wide
transcription factor binding variation across multiple accession genomes; 2) to characterize the effect of
transcription factor coding variants on their genome-wide binding specificities and target genes; and 3) to
investigate how natural variation of protein-protein interactions alters target genes and genome-wide binding
specificities for interacting transcription factors. All three projects will use computational modeling to evaluate
the contributions from features in the binding site environment.
 Our proposed experiments and computational models will make a broad impact by characterizing
transcription factor binding variation and understanding the role played by sequence and non-sequence
features of endogenous genomic DNA. Our results will shed light on the fundamental principles underlying the
regulatory functions of genome and epigenome variation, empowering the discovery and prediction of
regulatory variants and their molecular mechanisms."

With the most people ever in history currently living with HIV, stopping the HIV epidemic remains imperative.
Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) limits viral replication, but is not curative. Thus, there is an urgent need
to design a functional cure via elimination of the viral reservoir. Timothy Brown, aka the Berlin Patient, and Adam
Castillejo, aka the London patient, were cured of HIV following leukemia-related, MHC-matched, allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a CCR5-deficient donor. While a CCR5-deficient immune
system can demonstrably yield a functional HIV cure, allogeneic stem cell transplantation is not scalable to the
general population and alternate approaches are needed. We have demonstrated that the CCR5-specific
antibody Leronlimab can pharmacologically mimic a CCR5 deficient donor by occupying all available CCR5
molecules. In order to deliver Leronlimab as a gene therapy option, new delivery modalities are needed. Here,
we are proposing to utilize our novel directed evolution technique to generate AAV vectors specific for T and B
cells. These novel AAV vectors will facilitate in vivo delivery of Leronlimab expression here, but more importantly
will support the future use of other anti-HIV approaches including CRISPR-Cas9, chimeric antigen receptors,
and broadly neutralizing antibodies by delivering these therapeutics to the relevant immune cell type. In specific
aim 1, we will generate and characterize AAV bearing capsids that target T and B cells specifically across both
macaques and humans. In aim 2, we will demonstrate proof-of-concept utility of these new AAVs by delivering
Leronlimab to SHIV-infected, ART suppressed macaques to determine if a functional cure can be achieved with
this approach. This work would expand our knowledge of the mechanism of HIV cure by showing the utility of
long-term antibody-based competitive CCR5 inhibition and establish a new set of AAV vectors to support in vivo
delivery of anti-HIV therapeutics."

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressiveand clinically heterogeneous malignancy derived from
B-cells transiting the germinal center (GC) reaction. Indeed, the biological heterogeneity of DLBCL aligns with a
continuum of developmental states within and subsequent to the GC reaction. The genetic hallmarks of DLBCL
are somatic mutation in chromatin modifier and transcription factor genes and immune synapse signaling
mediators. Examining mechanisms of action for these mutations has provided insights into discrete cell-intrinsic
processes that are deregulated in DLBCL, but do not account for how these mutations function, when they occur
together in the same lymphoma cells, how they shape the lymphoma microenvironment LME, how the LME
influences lymphomas, and how critical host features such as age influence and define the nature of these
lymphomas and their LME. DLBCLs are thus complex entities from the systems biology and immunological
standpoint and a paradigm shift in our thinking about these tumors is necessary to arrive at a definitive
understanding of disease pathogenesis and effective and precise therapeutic strategies. To address this
challenge we have assembled a team of experts with distinct spheres of expertise, suites of cutting edge
technologies and powerful and physiologically accurate model systems. They have worked together as a team
to develop a compelling body of preliminary data supporting the conceptual framework of this proposal, and have
developed critical resources such as shared genomics databases, primaryhuman PDX repositories, genetically
engineered mouse models, computational pipelines and graphical user interfaces, and others. They will address
the central hypotheses that i) chromatin is the key integrator, rheostat and executor of cell-intrinsic and cell-
extrinsic pathways regulating key GC cell fate decisions downstream of immune synapse signaling, ii) DLBCLs
reflect a continuum of malignant states with each tumor aligning with one or more points along GC B-cell
epigenetic trajectories, iii) GCB and ABC DLBCLs are defined by crosstalk between their chromatin landscapes
and other immune populations to shape the LME, iv) that these chromatin to LME effects vary in specific ways
with mutation profiles and with aging age, and that v) rational targeting of DLBCLs must take into account and
specifically antagonize these specific chromatin-immune synapse - LME scenarios to achieve long term tumor
eradication."
10852490,"All mammalian embryos undergo a highly conserved sequence of developmental events, but different species complete this sequence at significantly different speeds. Astonishingly, embryonic development is completed in 15 days in mice, 56 days in humans, and 116 days in elephants ADDIN EN.CITE [1, 2]. However, the mechanisms that regulate developmental rate remain unknown. This gap in our knowledge stems in large part from a lack of simple assays to precisely measure developmental rate in different species. In this project, we propose to leverage an in vitro system that recapitulates the difference in developmental rate between mouse and human. This system provides a quantitative measure of developmental speed as revealed by the period of the segmentation clock, a molecular oscillator associated with the rhythmic production of somites ADDIN EN.CITE [3, 4]. Using this system, we have previously shown that mass-specific metabolic rates are elevated in mouse cells compared to human cells, resulting in accelerated protein production and degradation rates that underlie their accelerated development [4]. This discovery prompted three important questions: (i) Why are basal metabolic rates elevated in mouse cells compared to human cells? (ii) Does metabolism also control the rates of mRNA production, processing and degradation? (iii) Are the same mechanisms conserved in other mammalian species? These questions will be directly addressed by our research aims. We expect to uncover strategies for the manipulation of developmental speed, giving rise to multiple valuable applications. Accelerating the differentiation and maturation of human pluripotent stem cells in vitro would remove a major roadblock in the use of these cells for disease modeling and cell therapy [5]. Moreover, perturbations that slow down the growth of embryonic cells could be applied to limit the proliferation of cancer cells, which often re-activate developmental programs including features of embryonic metabolism ADDIN EN.CITE [6, 7]. Lastly, given the close interconnection of developmental rate and longevity, we expect this work to also shed light on the lifespan determination and aging process [8]. Successful implementation of these scientific aims requires a welcoming and equitable research culture that synthesizes diverse perspectives. Towards this goal, we will also implement DEIA-related aims to recruit diverse researchers, create safe spaces for marginalized trainees, and enhance mentorship at all levels."

The emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern is threatening global health and our ability to
prevent COVID-19 disease, raising concerns about a potential new wave of the pandemic. HIV may complicate
the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to eradicate the virus. While most people with a
competent immune system successfully clear SARS-CoV-2 infection within days, people living with HIV with
weakened immunity can carry persistent infection for months. Individuals with immunodeficiency may also
have a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection that can further extend the duration of infectiousness with high
viral load. As a result, chronically infected individuals are potentially contagious for an extended period of time
and may sustain transmission in the community. Similar to other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 accumulates mutations
over time as it replicates within the host. Therefore, chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection in the context of a
weakened immune system may provide the time and the environment needed for the virus to replicate and
evolve genetic mutations associated with survival advantages, including increased transmissibility and
resistance to COVID-19 vaccines or treatment. The proposed research aims to understand the overall impact
of HIV infection on the SARS-CoV-2 viral evolution and transmission dynamics in a setting with high HIV
prevalence. We will address current knowledge gaps by integrating SARS-CoV-2 genomic data, patient-level
clinical data, and epidemiological data to achieve the following aims: 1) we will determine the effect of HIV
infection on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants; and 2) we will
determine the effect of HIV-associated immunosuppression on the acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 mutations. For
the first Aim, advanced phylodynamic methods will be applied to determine how HIV affects the transmission

individual and population-level COVID-19 transmission. For the second Aim, we will recruit and follow a cohort
of COVID-19 patients with and without HIV infection to determine the effect of HIV-associated
immunosuppression on the rate of emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutations. The proposed research will also utilize
active case finding to minimize sampling bias. Findings from this project will inform the development of optimal
public health interventions to control the pandemic by disrupting transmission chains and prevent the
emergence and spread of alarming variants."

10854897,"CENTER FOR GENOME EDITING AND RECORDING: PROJECT SUMMARY
Recent advances in DNA sequencing and bioinformatics have generated vast numbers of sequence variants
associated with disease that, in principle, hold the keys to breakthroughs in preventive medicine and
therapeutic intervention. However, realizing the promise of personalized medicine will require accurate
manipulation of DNA sequences and gene expression as well as interrogation of the functional consequences
of sequence variants at a scale and level of accuracy not currently possible.
 The Center for Genome Editing and Recording (CGER) will address these challenges by creating
technologies to detect, alter and record the sequence and output of the genome in individual cells and tissues.
The CGER will exploit the programmable DNA binding and nickase activity of CRISPR-Cas proteins as well as
engineered zinc finger and TALE proteins to create a new generation of tools to precisely engineer the genome
and epigenome. These platforms will enable high-precision engineering of both the nuclear and mitochondrial
genomes as well as heritable silencing or activation of messenger RNAs, long noncoding RNA and a host of
other regulatory elements such as enhancers and insulator regions. Critically, these alterations can be made
without introducing double stranded breaks to DNA, thereby avoiding DNA toxicity and minimizing reliance on
complex and difficult-to-control endogenous DNA repair pathways. Collectively, these technologies will usher in
a new era of safer, high precision and multiplexed genome and epigenome editing.
 In addition, we will exploit these platforms to develop higher-level multichannel molecular recorders that
will allow us to track and reconstruct the life history of cells in an in vivo setting. We will add the ability to follow
cells in space and time as well as record the history of their past cellular states to the existing phylogenetic
lineage tracing systems pioneered in the previous embodiment of this Center.
 The center will be led by a team that collectively has a remarkable track record of developing bold,
impactful new tools to expand their precision, efficacy, safety and scope, and finally exploiting these new
capabilities to develop novel strategies to explore fundamental biological and biomedical problems. Our
multidisciplinary team has a rich history of working together, which has been greatly accelerated by the CEGS
structure in a manner that would simply not be possible if each co-PI had been working on similar problems in
isolation. Leveraging the capabilities of the Whitehead Institute, MIT, The Broad Institute, Harvard University,
Harvard Medical School, The Lewis Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics at Princeton and the
Massachusetts General Hospital, we aim to create transformative capabilities and have access to state-of-the-
art research facilities as well as resources for training, education and outreach that will attract diverse talent to
the field of genomics research."
10855765,"Abstract
Diarrheal diseases are the among the leading cause of death in children worldwide, most of which occur in
low-income countries. In high-income countries, pediatric diarrhea remains a major utilization of healthcare
resources. The cornerstone for management of diarrhea is rehydration, though antimicrobials are beneficial in
some instances. Unfortunately, given that treatment is frequently empiric, based mostly on clinical suspicion for
bacterial causes, antimicrobials are overused in management of diarrheal illness worldwide. In high-income
countries, diagnostic testing is oftentimes overutilized. Thus, there is a need for clinical decision support tools
for antimicrobial and diagnostic stewardship in many settings. Current clinical prediction tools are based mostly
on patient-intrinsic properties such as the clinical exam and symptom history specific for that patient. We have
preliminary data suggesting that the integration of patient-extrinsic data, including climate and seasonality
parameters, and population-level pre-test probabilities (from prior patients and prior years’ prevalence), can
improve the performance of a clinical prediction model. We also have preliminary data showing the potential for
an electronic clinical decision-support tool (eCDST) that estimates diarrheal etiology to decrease antibiotic
prescription rates. Our overarching goal is to: 1) improve diarrhea clinical prediction through integration of
patient-extrinsic data sources, and 2) explore the potential feasibility and utility of an eCDST, such as a
smartphone application or an electronic health record tool. In Aim 1, we will use data from several prospective
clinical studies of pediatric diarrhea to build improved clinical prediction models that includes patient-extrinsic
data sources. In Aim 2, we will determine the potential feasibility, utility, and economic impact of an eCDST for
antibiotic and diagnostic stewardship by examining clinican and caregiver perspectives through in-depth
interviews and focus groups. We will also perform an economic evaluation of eCDST in a US setting.
Completion of the Aims will result in an optimized clinical prediction model using big data and lay the
groundwork needed to inform the design of implementation studies of eCDSTs for management of pediatric
diarrhea."

The Alaska Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) Project is an on-going
survey of mothers of newborns initiated by the State of Alaska Division of Public Health, Section
of Maternal, Child and Family Health in 1990. PRAMS was developed by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Division of Reproductive Health and is part of CDC's
initiative to reduce infant mortality and low birth weight. PRAMS collects state-specific,
population-based data on maternal attitudes and experiences before, during, and after
pregnancy by means of a mailed survey with phone follow-up for mail non-respondents. PRAMS
was designed to supplement Vital Records data by providing state-specific data on maternal
behaviors and experiences to be used for planning and assessing perinatal health programs.
The global goal of PRAMS is to reduce infant morbidity and mortality by influencing maternal
behaviors during and immediately after pregnancy. Four specific objectives to achieve PRAMS'
goal are:
To collect population-based data of high scientific quality.
To conduct comprehensive analyses.
To translate results from analyses into information for planning and evaluating public
health programs and policy.
To build state capacity to collect, analyze, and translate data to address relevant public
health issues dealing with pregnancy and early infancy."
10809587,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 In 2017 South Dakota ranked #47 in infant mortality, #49 in neonatal mortality, and #31 in
postneonatal mortality despite having one of the lowest rates of low birthweight deliveries
(<2500g; #2 in 2018) and preterm births (<37 weeks; #16 in 2018). A Governor’s Task Force on
Infant Mortality was formed in 2011 with the First Lady serving as the Chairperson. Several
recommendations resulted, including a recommendation to enhance state and county-level data
regarding pregnancy experiences, risk, barriers, outcomes and infant care practices.
Historically, there have been little data available on factors that influence health behaviors and
attitudes of South Dakota mothers around the time of pregnancy. The South Dakota
Department of Health (SDDOH) recognized that the PRAMS survey is a tool to provide that
information and in 2013 contracted with South Dakota State University (SDSU) to provide
Maternal and Child Health (MCH) epidemiological services and to conduct the first statewide SD
PRAMS-like surveys in 2014 and 2016. Since 2017 SDDOH and SDSU have successfully
participated in the CDC-funded PRAMS, consistently obtaining response rates greater than
64%. SD PRAMS data have been disseminated widely in both peer-reviewed literature and in
the form of infographics; it also will be used to address state objectives as part of the upcoming
MCH Title V Block Grant renewal. Domestic violence data are utilized by the Sexual
Violence/Rape Prevention Education group, data on smoking and alcohol use are used by the
Office on Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, and reports concerning American
Indian mothers are being developed for distribution to individual Tribes and the Great Plains
Tribal Chairmen’s Health Board and Great Plains Tribal Epidemiology Center. The current
proposal is for South Dakota to serve as a Core Surveillance site (Component A) in the CDC
PRAMS. The SD PRAMS will stratify sampling by maternal race (non-Hispanic white, American
Indian, and other races) in order to obtain race specific prevalence rates that can be used to
address racial disparities that occur in South Dakota. The need is significant, the data are being
used, and we have had excellent statewide participation rates."

Mitochondrial diseases are respiratory chain disorders in which the mitochondria are no longer operating
efficiently to produce ATP, usually due to a problem with one or more components of the oxidative
phosphorylation machinery. Mitochondrial diseases manifesting as encephalopathies occur at a rate of 1 in 5000
live births and are often fatal in the first few years of life. The genetic cause and clinical course of these
encephalopathies, e.g., Complex I deficient Leigh Syndrome, are well-described. The effective treatment of these
diseases is limited by our lack of mechanistic understanding of pathomechanisms that drive neuronal decline,
beyond the known Complex-I bioenergetic deficit.
We have previously described the reaction of the citric acid cycle metabolite fumarate with protein cysteine
residues to generate an irreversible modification, 2-succinocysteine (2SC), also known as protein succination.
Fumarate and protein succination increase in the Ndufs4 knockout mouse model of mitochondrial Complex I
deficiency. We demonstrate that the succination of a component of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (α-
KGDH) complex impairs the enzymatic activity of this complex. This results in decreased succinyl CoA production,
and impaired substrate level phosphorylation to produce much needed GTP/ATP. We hypothesize that metabolic
acidosis derived from the Complex I loss redirects α-KG toward 2-hydroxyglutarate production. We predict that
this influences the epigenetic landscape in the affected neurons.
The citric acid cycle of other non-neuronal cells are also impacted in the Ndufs4 knockout mouse. We show
preliminary data to demonstrate an impaired ability to produce itaconate, an important anti-inflammatory
metabolite. This is significant given the accumulation of microglia in the center of neuropathological lesions. Our
novel hypotheses link specific citric acid cycle perturbations to the chemical modifications of proteins that may
accelerate the biochemical damage within the regions most affected by pathology. To address these specific
pathomechanisms we outline targeted therapeutic approaches that should reduce the drivers of neuropathology."
10842430,"Resolving amygdala microcircuits: implications for function 
Years of neuroimaging research in human psychiatric disorders, including at-risk populations, highlights alterations in circuits involving the amygdala. 'Fingerprints' of specific cortical and amygdala correlated activity promise to help identify specific circuits involved in particular diseases. Despite this, the structural or 'wiring' details of cortical-amygdala circuits remain obscure. Here we examine the idea that the unique symptom profiles across heterogeneous disorders are best explained by how different combinations of cortical inputs form 'microcircuits' in the amygdala, each associated with unique output paths. This proposal focuses on cortical nodes that project to the amygdala, and are frequently involved in psychiatric conditions. The subgenual anterior cingulate (sgACC) and rostral agranular insula (Ia) mediate internal body sensations, or 'interoceptive states'; the perigenual ACC (pgACC) and the middle, dysgranular insula (Id) are regions involved in 'social monitoring' and affiliative responses. Using dual anterograde tract tracing approaches in the same animal, our preliminary data show that afferent terminals from pgACC 'social monitoring' nodes are always 'nested' in terminals arriving from the sgACC ('interoceptive) in the amygdala. sgACC terminals cover a broader territory. This overlap creates terminal 'hotspots' of sgACC and pgACC afferent integration. At the cellular level, sgACC and pgACC associated terminals almost always co-contacted pyramidal cells (rather than segregating to different populations), and did so in a very stable ratio. These data indicate normal, tight afferent control, and integration of incoming information, onto amygdala neurons in these 'hotspots'. This terminal balance suggests an anatomic substrate that may be altered in various disease states. We also found that amygdala neurons in converging sgACC/pgACC hotspots had distinct projections back to the cortex, which were different than from non-hotspots regions. In this proposal, we dissect microcircuits involving sgACC, Ia, pgACC, and Id. We begin with determining specific cortical networks involving these nodes (Aim 1), then examine how afferent terminals from different two-node systems overlap or segregate in the amygdala, including at the cellular level (Aim 2A, B). We then examine whether amygdala neurons in converging afferent 'hotspots' have unique outputs to the cortex (Aim 3)."

Variation in DNA sequences contributes to variation in gene expression, splicing, and protein function, which
may in turn impact evolutionary fitness. Using humans as a model, my lab seeks to understand the mechanisms
linking DNA variation to cellular and organismal phenotypes and fitness. To this end, we propose to develop and
apply computational and statistical methods that leverage genomic, functional genomic, and phenotypic data to
achieve a more complete view of germline and somatic evolution within our species.
 One goal of our work is to overcome limitations of previous studies to better understand functional
genomic diversity and evolution. To date, gene expression studies in humans have been strongly biased toward
populations of European ancestries, limiting broader understanding of gene expression evolution. To fill this gap,
my lab has generated RNA-seq data from diverse populations of the 1000 Genomes Project. These data will
allow us to quantify the distribution of variation in gene expression and splicing within and between human
populations and link these patterns to demographic and selective events by which they originated. By intersecting
these data with published DNA sequencing data from the same samples, we propose to leverage the haplotype
structure of the sample to home in on variants with causal effects on gene expression and splicing. We will
supplement these data with single-molecule long-read sequencing of RNA from the same samples, offering
unprecedented resolution of isoform diversity within and between human populations.
 A second goal of our work is to leverage the tools of population genetics to understand evolutionary
forces that operate on developmental timescales, shaping genetic diversity among cells within individuals.
Genetic variation among gametes traces to meiotic recombination, whereby parental genomes are shuffled to
produce diverse haploid sperm or eggs. Recombination is also essential for accurate chromosome segregation,
as abnormal numbers or locations of meiotic crossovers predispose to aneuploidy. However, recombination is
also mutagenic, evidenced by the enrichment of point mutations and structural variation at recombination
hotspots. We propose to develop a quantitative genetic model to understand these inherent fitness tradeoffs and
test its predictions on data from preimplantation embryos. We are also extending our work to understand
mechanisms of somatic evolution shaping other developmental systems such as clonal hematopoiesis—a
phenomenon whereby a subset of blood stem cells disproportionately contributes to the descendant population.
Through simulation and analysis of published sequencing data from single blood cells, we will develop and test
phylogenetic methods toward a better understanding of the evolutionary forces shaping clonal hematopoiesis.
 In the coming years, my lab will continue to integrate diverse datasets and novel quantitative methods to
understand relationships between genetic variation, phenotypic variation, and fitness."

Organism development and cellular homeostasis depend on tightly regulated gene expression programs.
Disruptions in gene regulation lead to developmental defects and contribute to human diseases including
cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs, play a critical role in
post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by repressing target genes. Dysregulation of miRNA activity
can lead to disproportionate gene silencing or overexpression, with damaging consequences to organism
development and health. Despite the significant role of miRNA function in development and disease, our
understanding of how miRNA activity is regulated to maintain appropriate levels of gene repression remains
incomplete. The overarching goal of this research is to understand how the gene-regulatory activity of miRNAs
is controlled within the complex context of a developing organism. More specifically, we will investigate how
miRNA target specificity is established through regulated, miRNA strand specific loading of the miRNA induced
silencing complex (miRISC) and how key miRISC components and cofactors impact gene-regulatory miRNA
activity. We will continue to leverage the power of C. elegans and will, through a range of methodologies,
delineate the in vivo genetic and molecular networks regulating miRNA activity at steps of miRNA biogenesis
and target repression. This research is expected to lay a foundation for understanding how gene regulatory
programs are maintained during organism development through robust regulation of miRNA activity and how
dysregulation of miRNA function leads to loss of gene expression control in disease."

Cells assemble functionally diverse actin cytoskeleton networks with distinct architectures and
dynamics to drive fundamental processes such as polarization, motility, and division. The size,
organization, and dynamics of different actin filament networks are tailored by the coordinated
activity of distinct but overlapping sets of actin-binding proteins with complementary binding
properties. Because cells assemble and maintain multiple self-organized F-actin networks
simultaneously from the same pool of limited cellular components, focusing on single networks
provides limited overall understanding of actin cytoskeletal dynamics. We have established
important cross-talk interactions between diverse F-actin networks that help dictate their size,
form, and function. We use systems level approaches to investigate the underlying molecular
mechanisms that govern the direct and indirect interactions between self-organized F-actin
networks that determine their unique identities and functions within a common cytoplasm.
 We are focusing on two major outstanding questions relating to actin cytoskeleton self-
organization, which we are simultaneously addressing in both fission yeast cells and one-cell
C.elegans embryos to compare key mechanistic similarities and differences between these
important model systems. The first is to determine how cells allocate actin monomers between
competing F-actin networks to help tune network size and density (Focus 1). Although
unassembled G-actin was not thought to be limiting, we systematically showed that competition
for G-actin helps control the size and density of competitive F-actin networks in fission yeast, and
that the actin monomer protein profilin plays a major role in regulating competition for limiting G-
actin. Our goal is to determine the underlying mechanisms by which actin-binding proteins (ABPs)
contribute to the proper distribution of G-actin between functionally diverse actin cytoskeleton
networks. The second is to elucidate how F-actin networks recruit the specific set of ABPs whose
biochemical activities define the unique characteristics of each network (Focus 2). We will
investigate the underlying intrinsic molecular mechanisms by which ABPs self-sort to particular
F-actin networks within a common cytoplasm, including (1) the contribution of competition and
cooperation between ABPs for associating with actin filaments, and (2) whether actin assembly
factors initiate self-sorting by biasing the association of particular ABPs."

Membrane transport systems are critical for controlling the central pathway of cellular energetics, from glucose
transport across the membrane to regulating energy production in mitochondria. These systems mediate the
movement of metabolites and ions between cellular compartments, which is fundamental to normal physiology.
Their dysregulation is both a hallmark and driver of many pathologies.
 Elucidating the molecular basis of how mitochondrial transport systems work is a particularly rich vein:
Insights into their transport mechanisms and regulations provide essential information for understanding their
functions and roles in mitochondrial physiology. Defects in mitochondrial transport proteins have been implicated
in diseases ranging from metabolic disorders to cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, so mechanistic
understanding can shed light on disease processes.
 Here, we propose to decipher the molecular mechanisms and regulation of three key mitochondrial
membrane transport systems: 1) the mitochondria calcium uniporter, which constitutes the major calcium portal
on mitochondria and mediates rapid calcium uptake, regulating ATP production and cellular calcium signaling; 2)
the active calcium transporter NCLX, which plays important roles in various aspects of physiology; and 3) the
mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), which transports pyruvate from cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix,
controlling a key metabolic branch point. We take a multi-disciplinary approach to determine the mechanisms of
these dynamic membrane protein machines. Our goal is to answer central questions in the field, including
substrate selectivity, conformational transitions, small molecule modulations, and transport activity regulation.
 Successful completion of the proposed work will offer invaluable insights into these essential mitochondrial
transport systems. This will deliver new and deeper understanding of mitochondrial physiology and provide novel
insights into general principles of membrane transport processes. Furthermore, given that these membrane
transport systems are promising drug targets, we expect our mechanistic insights will inform rational design for
novel inhibitors and modulators, potentially leading to new therapies for patients."
10842952,"Our lab studies how transmembrane proteins signal from the cell's external environment to its interior during
animal development and adulthood, how dysregulation of transmembrane signaling leads to disease, and how
to correct pathological transmembrane signaling via novel mechanism-inspired therapeutic strategies. We focus
on the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway, a fundamental signaling cascade that specifies the development of nearly every
vertebrate organ and ensures homeostasis during adulthood. Hh also serves as a leading model for signal
transduction within the primary cilium, a tiny antenna-shaped protrusion found on nearly every cell in the body
that is critical for G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) cascades in many physiological systems. While the
importance of Hh signaling in health and disease is clear, the biochemical mechanisms underlying the central
steps in this cascade are surprisingly mysterious. Our MIRA program focuses on three central problems in Hh
and GPCR signaling: 1) How are Hh signals received and deciphered at the cell surface? 2) How are Hh signals
transmitted intracellularly? 3) Why must many GPCRs localize to the cilium to perform their biological functions?
Our seminal contributions from the work of our first MIRA include: 1) Defining the biochemical and structural
mechanism of activation for SMOOTHENED (SMO), an atypical GPCR and the key transducer of Hh signals at
the ciliary membrane. We found that SMO is activated by cholesterol, which binds to a site deep within the SMO
membrane-spanning domain; and 2) Demonstrating that SMO signals intracellularly via a mechanism
unprecedented in GPCR biology: SMO directly binds the protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunit and physically
blocks its enzymatic activity. These discoveries have generated new principles regarding how cholesterol can
serve as a GPCR’s key activating “switch”, and how GPCRs can directly regulate the activity of kinases.
The next phase of our MIRA builds on this foundation, tackling a number of the outstanding questions in the
field. We will learn how SMO is regulated by the Hh receptor and putative sterol transporter PTCH1, test our
mechanistic model for SMO activity using in vivo Hh signal transduction systems, and learn how SMO-PKA
signaling is regulated by lipids proteins, post-translational modifications, and pathway deactivation mechanisms.
Finally, we will embark on a new research direction, using the concepts and tools from our Hh studies to test
roles for cholesterol and phosphorylation codes in the operation of ciliary GPCRs. Together, these investigations
will advance our understanding of the signal transduction mechanisms underlying Hh and other ciliary GPCR
cascades, with broad implications for development, physiology, and disease. These studies will also enable the
generation of diagnostic and therapeutic tools for a range of devastating disorders, including congenital defects,
malignancies, and dysfunction of the nervous, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal systems."

 The family of bacterial toxins, botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs), produced by spore-
forming Gram-positive Clostridium bacteria, are the most potent toxins known. They cause the
deadly paralytic disease botulism in humans and animals. These toxins are one of the six most
dangerous potential bioterrorism agents (Category A and Tier 1). They target motor neurons
with extreme specificity, enter the cytosol of neurons, and block neuronal activity, causing
muscle paralysis. A major contributor to the threat of BoNTs is their extremely long half-life
within the cytosol of motor neurons – the toxin resides in the cytosol for 4-6 months in humans
and causes persistent paralysis for months. To date, no therapeutics can inhibit toxins within the
cytosol of neurons.
 Here we propose to create an effective post-exposure treatment for this top-priority
bioterrorism agent and deadly bacterial toxins. This treatment is based on modifying a recently
discovered new bacterial toxin BoNT/X and utilizing this engineered protein to deliver a fused
neutralizing antibody against BoNTs into the cytosol of motor neurons. Our extensive
preliminary studies have provided working prototypes, which completely rescue mice from
systemic toxicity of BoNTs in multiple post-exposure models. Here we propose three aims to
further validate our hypothesis by (1) refining the chimeric toxin platform; (2) optimizing the
nanobody cargo against BoNTs; and (3) establishing pharmacokinetic parameters and
validating therapeutic efficacy in both rodent and guinea pig models.
 Success of these aims will create an effective post-exposure treatment for a top-priority
bioterrorism agent, and also develop a novel protein-based delivery platform for targeting motor
neurons, thus offering new tools for targeting cytosolic processes and “undruggable” proteins in
neurons."

Uterine fibroids (UFs) are the most important benign neoplastic threat to women’s health worldwide. As no long-
term non-invasive treatment option exists for UFs, deeper insight into tumor etiology is key to develop more
effective therapies. Accordingly, this proposal is impactful as it suggests a novel etiological basis for the
predominant UF subtype and further offers proof of concept for therapeutic intervention in this specific
genetic setting. UFs arise from the genetic transformation of a single myometrial stem cell (MM SC) into a tumor
initiating cell (UF SC) that seeds monoclonal tumor growth. Notably, recurrent somatic mutations in the RNA
polymerase II (RNAPII) Mediator subunit MED12 account for ~70% of UFs, but how these mutations drive cell
transformation and tumor formation is unclear. Previously, we showed that MED12 mutations disrupt CycC-
CDK8 kinase activity in Mediator, revealing the first and heretofore only known biochemical defect arising from
these pathogenic mutations and further implying a new etiological role for CDK8 in UF pathogenesis. This
breakthrough discovery was the basis for our original application which spawned major advances that justify
studies in this renewal application to clarify the molecular basis and therapeutic implications of Mediator kinase
dysfunction in the pathogenesis of MED12-mutant UFs. Herein, we show that MED12 mutations impair CDK8
activity through T-loop destabilization, leading to a profoundly altered phosphoproteome and dysregulation
of cell growth and myogenic gene expression programs that dictate MM SC fate. Further, we show that
MED12 mutation-induced CDK8 inactivation triggers R-loop-dependent replication stress, suggesting a
possible basis for genomic instability and a new therapeutic vulnerability in this dominant UF subclass.
Accordingly, we hypothesize that MED12 mutation-induced Mediator kinase disruption drives tumor initiation
and progression through aberrant MM SC reprogramming and replication stress-dependent chromosomal
instability. We further propose that clinically relevant ATR axis inhibitors will provide therapeutic benefit in a
preclinical model of MED12-mutant UFs. To test this, we will: (1) Elucidate the biochemical basis by which
MED12 mutations disrupt Mediator kinase activity. Using structural biology and biochemistry, we will determine
the impact of mutant MED12 on CDK8 T-loop stability and conformational dynamics as well as CycC-CDK8
substrate binding and catalytic efficiency; (2) Elucidate the molecular basis by which Mediator kinase disruption
drives UF initiation. We will link Mediator kinase-dependent changes in MM SC self-renewal and differentiation
with genome-wide enhancer reprogramming and altered transcriptional output and further ask if Mediator kinase
disruption can reprogram MM SCs to form UF tumors vivo; (3) Elucidate the molecular basis by which Mediator
kinase disruption drives UF progression. We will investigate RNAPII promoter pausing defects as a basis for
aberrant R-loop accrual, determine if R-loop-induced replication stress triggers mitotic chromosomal breaks, and
evaluate the efficacy of ATR axis inhibitors in a preclinical mouse model of MED12-mutant UFs."

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the lives of people
worldwide. Yet, the effect on persons living with HIV (PLWH) is not known. Emerging evidence suggests that
PLWH have a similar or modestly higher risk of COVID-19 acquisition, and higher risk for worse COVID-19
outcomes, including hospitalization and death. However, the data has been mixed as several studies have
suggested no difference in clinical outcomes. Several studies also found that outcomes are worse among
those without viral suppression and those with lower CD4 counts, highlighting the importance of continued HIV
care. Yet, early reports suggest that COVID-19 has disrupted services across the HIV care continuum. As the
pandemic continues to unfold, it is critical to better characterize the relationship between COVID and outcomes
among PLWH. In addition, we need to identify how the pandemic and the public health strategies to combat
the pandemic impacted the provision of care for PLWH, as well as whether any adverse effects are lasting.
Approximately 40% of PLWH are enrolled in Medicaid. The proposed project will include Medicaid beneficiaries
from 27 states and Washington, DC between 2018 and 2024 with a conservative estimate of 25 million
beneficiaries and 275,000 PLWH enrolled annually. Medicaid is an important complement to HIV cohort
studies as it affords us the breadth of data to evaluate differences by geographic location, social determinants
of health at the community level, as well as among important sub-populations. We will assess the relationship
between HIV and COVID-19 disease, including on hospitalization due to COVID-19 and adverse conditions
due to COVID like post-acute sequala of COVID-19 (PASC). We will also evaluate the impact of the COVID19
pandemic on the provision of care for prevention of HIV and HIV care. We will assess care across the HIV care
continuum including PrEP prescription, HIV testing, and annual HIV care visits, viral load tests, and ARV
medication possession ratio. We will also evaluate impacts on the provision of care for non-HIV conditions,
including annual wellness visits, preventive screenings and health condition management. We will compare
care rates during the pre-COVID period (2001-2019), acute COVID period (2020-2021), and post-acute COVID
period (2022-2024) overall and by geographic location (state, urban/rural, local government area [LGA],
smallest government region e.g. county, city, town, etc.) and regional severity of COVID-19 cases and COVID-
19 policies. Findings from the proposed study will help inform and target interventions to improve care for
PLWH in the future."

 The cerebellum optimizes motor and non-motor performance by integrating input signals encoding
prediction error with input relaying a spectrum of multisensory and contextual information. These input
pathways–carried by climbing fiber axons (CFs) from the inferior olive and parallel fiber axons (PFs) of
cerebellar granule cells, respectively–converge on the elaborate dendritic arbor of Purkinje cells (PCs), the
primary cell type and sole output of the cerebellar cortex. Theories of cerebellar function are centered around
PC-mediated integration and rely on the principles that each PC: 1) is a structurally and functionally redundant
unit in the cerebellar cortex, 2) receives olivary ‘teaching’ signal input from only one CF, and 3) exhibits
homogenous signaling across the entire dendritic tree.
 The specific aims of this proposal are designed to challenge the universality of these principles by
revealing a ‘super-integrator’ PC subpopulation characterized by input from multiple CFs and non-homogenous
signaling across dendrites. These PCs are defined morphologically by segregated dendritic compartments
from either the early bifurcation of their primary dendrite (‘Split’) or multiple primary dendrites emerging from
the soma (‘Poly’). ‘Super-integrator’ PCs are defined functionally by the presence of non-homogenous dendritic
signaling produced by independent input to each compartment, such as from multi-CF innervation.
 This study will examine the anatomical CF→PC connection, describe signal heterogeneity in PC dendritic
compartments, and examine how these functional elements affect integration during multisensory processing.
To comprehensively assess these anatomical and functional features of PCs, experiments will be balanced
between tightly controlled in vitro preparations and physiologically relevant in vivo conditions and will combine
electrophysiology, Ca2+ imaging, and tracer immunolabeling methods. A central training goal of this proposal is
to learn and apply a range of techniques, especially by pairing Ca2+ imaging and electrophysiology, and data
analysis methods toward my development as an independent researcher.
 The final results of this work will provide a significant update to our current understanding of fundamental
cerebellar anatomy and function. This update will introduce a panel of new research questions to better
understand task-dependent cerebellar computations, expansion and compression of information as it flows
through cerebellar circuits, and sources of dysfunction in disease as putative targets for therapy. Some
features of ‘super-integrator’ PCs in wildtype animals (e.g. abnormal CF inputs and multi-compartment
morphology) overlap with features that are overexpressed in mouse models of autism spectrum disorder. It is
possible that, in addition to conferring normal cerebellar function, an overabundance of ‘super-integrator’ PCs
may underlie some characteristics of cerebellar dysfunction in autism."
10845380,"SUMMARY
Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a large heterogeneous group of neurogenetic disorders caused
by the length-dependent degeneration of cortical motor neuron axons. Cortical motor neurons, a group
of projection neurons located in motor cortex, control muscle movement through lower motor neurons in
the brain stem and spinal cord. Degeneration of these neurons interrupts the signal transmission from
brain to spinal cord and then muscles, resulting in progressive spasticity and weakness in muscles.
Currently, there remains a lack of effective treatment to ameliorate, stop, or reverse axonal defects in
HSPs. Recent studies show that several HSP proteins can regulate the size of lipid droplets, implying
their roles in lipid metabolisms. Glial cells play an important for generating and regulating lipid
metabolism in the brain. However, whether lipid metabolism is altered in HSP brain and what role glial
cells play in the pathogenesis of HSP are largely unknown. The goal of this proposed study is to dissect
the novel role of lipid metabolism and the interplay between glial cells and neurons in the pathogenesis
of HSP using co-cultures of cortical neurons and glial cells derived from iPSCs of SPG3A patients.
SPG3A is the most common early-onset form of HSP caused by mutations in the ATL-1 gene that
encodes atlastin-1 protein. We will test our hypotheses by pursuing the following three aims: 1) to
identify the contribution of glial cells to axonal and synaptic defects in SPG3A, 2) to determine the role
of glial cells in impaired cholesterol homeostasis in SPG3A, and 3) to rescue axonal and synaptic
defects in SPG3A by targeting the impaired glia-neuron interaction. By comparing co-cultures of cortical
neurons with normal or SPG3A glial cells, our study will provide insights into the role of glial cells in
HSP. The cause-effect relationship between atlastin-1 mutations and axonal phenotypes will be
confirmed by rescuing the mutations in SPG3A iPSCs and by knocking in mutations to normal human
pluripotent stem cells. Moreover, rescue experiments will be performed to identify potential approaches
for mitigating axonal and synaptic defects in HSP through regulating lipid metabolism in glial cells.
Together, our study is expected to reveal novel roles of glial cells in the pathogenesis of HSP and
identify new targets for therapeutic intervention in HSP."

 Processes & Outcomes in Safety Net Practices Caring for Health Disparity Populations
ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY
 Primary care provides more than half of all outpatient visits ― 500 million each year ― with only 30% of
the healthcare workforce and <6% of national healthcare expenditure, informed by only 0.2% of the NIH
research budget. Healthcare systems based on primary care have healthier populations, greater equity, and
lower costs. Our ongoing national practice and patient surveys show that the pandemic and resulting ongoing
health care system and social changes are having a devastating effects on the primary care workforce and its
ability to integrate and personalize care in a fragmented, impersonal, inequitable healthcare system.
 Yet, amidst the COVID-19 natural disaster, ongoing primary care innovations provide hope for
advancing equity for health disparity populations. We have a unique opportunity to study the effects of the
pandemic in a national network of 926 community health centers serving >2.6 million patients from health
disparity populations. The proposed study will:
1) Identify changes in health care delivery to health disparity populations in community health centers in
 response to the continuing practice, social and policy changes launched by the COVID-19 pandemic;
2) Assess the longitudinal impact of these practice changes on care quality in health disparity populations;
3) Examine the ongoing effects of these changes on community health center workforce stability;
4) Identify promising strategies to improve healthcare equity after a natural disaster & varied human response.
 In response to PA-20-172: Long-Term Effects of Disasters on Health Care Systems Serving Health
Disparity Populations, we will conduct a time series analysis of practice changes and associated patient and
workforce outcomes initiated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing changes stimulated by it. Monthly
analyses will examine longitudinal changes in practice processes, patient outcomes, and workforce stability for
health disparity and other at-risk populations. For a five-year period going back to January 2020 ― the month
of the first known COVID-19 case in the US and the start of responding public health and practice changes ―
we will analyze and publicly report, on a monthly basis, practice changes and patient outcomes, to rapidly
inform decision making about primary care of health disparity populations. Subgroup analyses will examine
differences across 26 states that have had different societal responses to the pandemic. The findings from
these quantitative analyses of millions of patients being seen in hundreds of community health centers also will
be used to identify a purposive sample of exemplars and contrasting practices for in-depth case studies of
practice innovations that show promise in reducing healthcare disparities.
 Findings will generate vital new knowledge on the longitudinal effect of a pandemic on care provided to
health disparity populations and on the sustainability of the primary care community health center workforce,
and will inform efforts to improve health care equity after a natural disaster and varied human responses."

The University of California, Los Angeles proposes to serve as a Coordinating Center for the Western Region
for the NIH-NIDDK NIDDK Short-Term Experience Program to Unlock Potential (STEP-UP) Program. The
UCLA STEP-UP will provide an enriched summer research experience for promising high school students from
underrepresented racial/ethnic minority (URM) groups as well as students from other groups underrepresented
(URG) in medicine and science. The overarching goal of the UCLA STEP-UP is to prepare participating
students for research careers in the biomedical and clinical health sciences.
The paucity of participation from URM and URG communities in the scientific research workforce is a critical
limitation affecting the future of health research, and ultimately our nation’s health. Access to a high-quality
biomedical science education required for a research career remains largely influenced by factors such as
socioeconomic class, race/ethnicity, gender and/or national origin. There is a critical need to motivate and equip
URM and URG high school students with the requisite skill set to critically understand, explore and engage in
scientific research, as well as the confidence and communication skill set required for advancement in scientific
careers. Early interventions in the high school education timeline can help to build a diverse and inclusive
scientific workforce. The Program’s main components include: 1) Understanding responsible conduct of
research, 2) Exposure to scientific research environments, 3) Developing relationships with research mentors, 4)
Basic statistics, 5) Use of common laboratory equipment, 6) Development of a research abstract, 7) Lessons in
health disparities, and how biomedical research can improve health outcomes, 8) College planning, 9) Research
presentation skills, and 10) Scientific career exploration. The Program’s overarching goal is to increase the
number of URM and URG high school students prepared to pursue careers in NIDDK mission area related
biomedical and clinical health sciences. To this end, the Specific Aims are as follows:
Specific Aim 1: To engage 25 URM or URG high school students in the US Western Region each year in a
mentored, summer scientific research experience in basic, clinical, or translational research related to conditions
within the NIDDK mission.
Specific Aim 2: To provide 25 URM or URG high school students each year with an end of program
opportunity to present written reports and PowerPoint presentations based on their summer research projects at
the annual NIDDK STEP-UP research symposium on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.
Specific Aim 3: To evaluate the effectiveness of the UCLA STEP-UP to prepare 25 URM or URG high school
students each year to conduct biomedical research, engage with research mentors, produce a scientific
presentation, enhance their desire to pursue and successfully graduate with a STEM undergraduate major, and
pursue graduate programs in a science-related field focusing on NIDDK mission areas."

Cancer is a leading cause of death, but recent emergence of immunotherapies including the immune
checkpoint inhibitors has offered promising new cancer treatment options. It is also evident that tumor
immunity is highly complex and incompletely understood. The better understanding of tumor immune
regulation may lead to identification of additional targets for cancer immunomodulatory therapy. In this study
we will investigate the mechanism by which the cell surface receptor protein LRP5 regulates NK cell activities
and tumor immunity. In our preliminary studies, we found that loss of LRP5 led to increased activation of NK
cells independently of β-catenin stabilization despite LRP5 is involved in β-catenin regulation in other cells.
Thus, we hypothesize that LRP5 regulates NK activation via previously uncharacterized mechanisms.
Because genetic inactivation of LRP5 in NK cells suppresses tumor progression accompanied with enhanced
NK activities in mice, this new mechanism is potentially of important clinical implications. Our preliminary
results suggest that LRP5 may function as a fatty acid transporter leading to regulation of mTROC1 activity. In
this application, we will carry out comprehensive in vitro and in vivo investigations to characterize this new
mechanism for LRP5 and to determine the roles of this new mechanism in NK biology and tumor surveillance."

Falls and fear of falling (FOF) are the leading cause of injury, disability, and hospitalization in racially diverse

barriers to participate in fall prevention programs. More than half of older adults have maladaptive fall risk
appraisal (FRA), a condition in which there is a discrepancy between perceived fall risk (levels of FOF) and
physiological fall risk (balance performance) which may impede physical activity (PA). To help address
maladaptive FRA; we developed a fall risk appraisal matrix, a graphical grid categorizing levels of FOF (Mind)
and levels of balance (Body) into four quadrants: 1) rational FRA (low FOF and normal balance), 2)
incongruent FRA (low FOF despite poor balance), 3) irrational FRA (high FOF despite normal balance), and 4)
congruent FRA (high FOF and poor balance). We developed a novel, 8-week technology-based, individualized,

portable innovative technology—the BTrackS Balance System: BBS; b) cognitive reframing based on a novel

findings support the feasibility and acceptability of using BBS technology on screening LOA with maladaptive
FRA, highlight the importance of reducing sedentary time and increasing moderate to vigorous physical activity
(MVPA) time to help shift from maladaptive to adaptive FRA. Critically, we found that none of our LOA had
ever had their fall risk and FOF assessed before our study and their data reveal a strong relationship between
FOF and negative self-perceptions of aging. In our published pilot study, we found that the technology-based
PEER intervention had significant improvements in dynamic balance, reduced fall risk, and facilitated
maladaptive to adaptive shifting; however, our limited sample of LOA (40% of total) prevents strong
conclusions about effectiveness in this group. We use a clustered randomized controlled trial, and the

10744741,"Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) is a member of the BET (bromodomain and extra terminal domain)
family proteins that also include BRD2, BRD3, and BRDT. BRD4 facilitates the initiation and elongation of
transcription by binding to acetylated lysine residues of histone tails to promote the recruitment of the RNA
polymerase II complex to sites of active transcription. Since BRD4 is required for MYC oncogene expression,
BRD4 inhibition represents an attractive strategy to target MYC-dependent cancers via small-molecule inhibitors.
BRD4 is over-expression in both solid tumors and myeloid malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
BET inhibitors (BETi) have been shown to have efficacy against various types of tumors, especially MYC-driven
cancers. Despite robust studies of BRD4 in solid tumors, the role of BRD4 in normal hematopoiesis and the
impact of BRD4 overexpression on the pathogenesis of hematological malignancies remain largely unknown.
Filling this critical gap of knowledge is the primary goal of this 3-year SHINE application. In the current project,
we aim to determine the roles of BRD4 in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSC/HPCs) function and
explore whether Brd4 overexpression affects HSC/HPC cell fate and leukemic transformation. Using a
conditional Brd4 knock- out (Mx1Cre;Brd4f/f) mouse model, we found that while heterozygous deletion of Brd4
in mice did not cause noticeable changes in hematopoiesis, homozygous deletion of Brd4 in the hematopoietic
system quickly diminished HSC/HPCs and pan lineage cells due to the induction of apoptosis. Therefore, the
conditional Brd4 knock-out mouse model alone is not suitable for studying the hidden role of BRD4 in
HSC/HPC functions. We thus generated several Brd4 transgenic (Tg) mouse lines with different levels of BRD4
transgene expression (ranging from 25% to 200%). Our preliminary data showed that overexpression of BRD4
(Brd4200%Tg) in hematopoietic cells altered HSC/HPC pools in vivo and increased HSC/HPC replating potential
in vitro. Interestingly, re-expression of a lower level of BRD4 in Brd4Δ/Δ BMMNCs (Brd4Δ/Δ;Brd425%Tg)
significantly increased the cell survival and the frequencies of CFU-Cs. We hypothesize that a hypomorph
BRD4 mouse model (Mx1Cre;Brd4f/f;Brd425%Tg), by expressing a protectable level of BRD4 in hematopoiesis
which allow for HSC/HPC survival, would suit better for evaluating the hidden role of BRD4 in HSC/HPC
functions. We will also examine whether BETi affect normal hematopoiesis in mice. Furthermore, we will
decipher how BRD4 regulates the HSC/HPCs functions by assessing genome-wide BRD4, P-TEFb, Pol-II,
H3K27ac, and H3K122ac occupancies in HSC/HPCs and correlating with the gene expression outputs. These
studies are timely and fundamentally crucial for filling an essential and critical gap of knowledge towards
uncovering the hidden roles of BRD4 in normal and malignant hematopoiesis, thus fill a critical gap in
knowledge on Brd4 in hematopoiesis and BETi for the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies."
10851916,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Food allergy often starts early in life and can be life threatening. Early introduction of peanut consumption is
recommended to reduce development of peanut allergy. However, in the LEAP study, 14% of children were not
included because they were skin prick positive for peanut allergy at the start or because they developed reactions
during oral peanut exposures. Peanut allergy is associated with loss-of-function mutations in skin barrier genes.
In mechanistic studies, we demonstrated that neonatal mice with heterozygous skin barrier mutations developed
food allergy by skin co-exposure to detergent, food allergen and a ubiquitous environmental allergen, Alternaria
alternata (Alt) or house dust mite extract. Importantly, the skin sensitizations were performed before any visual
evidence of eczema in the neonates. It is conceivable that for children, skin sensitization with food antigens could
occur before clinical signs of eczema. We demonstrated that oral peanut consumption before skin sensitization
inhibited development of food allergy, but this inhibition was blocked by Alt on the skin during oral peanut
consumption. This may be important for children with skin barrier defects but without early signs of eczema, who
are exposed to ubiquitous environmental allergens while undergoing oral peanut induction of tolerance. In this
proposal, we develop the novel concept that there are skin-derived systemic factors that block tolerance and
that can serve as risk factors for development of food allergy, and that, there are skin-derived factors that may
predict existence of sensitization to food allergy before oral consumption of food allergens. Our preliminary data
from bulk and single cell RNA-seq analyses of sensitized skin from neonatal mice indicate signals that define
unique function of environmental allergen for induction of food allergy and signals that are unique to the
combination of Alt and food allergen exposure of neonates with skin barrier mutations. Our long-term goal is to
identify mechanisms for initiation of food allergy by skin exposures and identify factors for detection of risk for
skin sensitization. As a step towards our long-term goal, our central HYPOTHESIS is that initiation of food allergy
by skin exposure to allergen is mediated by signals from skin with barrier mutations that induce a network of cell
signals for activation of the immune system to generate allergen-specific IgE. We will test our central hypothesis
with the following aims: Aim 1. Test the hypotheses that skin, with barrier mutations, stimulated by food allergens
and environmental allergens produce factors that A) are systemic signals, B) can block oral food antigen-induced
tolerance and C) can mediate susceptibility to development of food allergy. Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that
initiation of food allergy is mediated by recognition molecules expressed by skin with barrier mutations. Aim 3.

Program addresses the shortage of under-represented (UR) scientists in biomedical sciences (BMS) research,
particularly in aging-related fields, by increasing research and career opportunities for UR trainees. ENGAGED
is a partnership of Program Directors at Wake Forest University School of Medicine (WFUSM), Wake Forest
University (WFU), and Winston-Salem State University (WSSU) that leverages collective strengths in research
on aging and vast academic and professional experiences; a history of collaborative diversity-focused
undergraduate (UG) research training programs in medicine, science, technology, engineering and math
(MSTEM); pre-clinical, clinical, population and translational BMS research expertise and funding in aging; clinical
experience addressing health disparities in aging populations; didactic training in aging-related topics; and
seasoned team-led training program administration expertise. The ENGAGED Measurable Objectives, which
remain aligned with PAR Goals are to: 1) Increase awareness of the unique health care issues facing a diverse
aging population and the opportunities to address these issues through research, and 2) Expand opportunities
for hands-on paid research internships during the academic year for WFUSM, WFU and WSSU students and
during the summer for students recruited locally and nationally. Research and career mentors (~37% UR) serve
as formal and informal counselors during and after the program and ~57% are members of established
WFUSM-supported and NIA-funded centers offering a wide range of research in aging. Tangible and
sustainable progress towards the Measurable Objectives during years 1-4 and early trainee outcomes
include: 1) Paid UG research opportunities via in-person or virtual programming provided 119 total positions for
61 unique UR individuals during academic year and summer sessions, with 49% participating in >1 session
(academic year Research Club, academic year Research Internship, Summer Internship); 2) New formal and
informal aging-related activities created or revamped/updated for trainees across the three partner sites
(Research Club, lectures/seminars, didactic courses, discussion sessions focused on aging); 3) Short-term
scholarly achievements include 31% trainee attendance/presentations at scientific meetings and 20% published
an abstract of the ENGAGED research; 4) While 26 remain in UG training (100% MSTEM), 34 of 35 graduated
(100% MSTEM BS/BA; 29% aging-related degrees). Longer-term early career outcomes indicate success of
graduates: 59% plan a future career in BMS research, with 56% of those in aging/health disparities research;
35% entered MSTEM advanced degree programs (MD, PhD, MS, health professional programs; 4 MS
degrees attained) and 9 more applying; ~80% are in the BMS workforce and/or advanced degree programs.
Thus, ENGAGED is well-positioned to advance our objectives from a solid foundation of promoting interest in,
and exposure to, research experiences in aging/health disparities for diverse UG trainees."
10849153,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We have developed the program, Pipeline for Aging Research Career Training (PACT). The project is a
research education and mentoring program featuring students and faculty from an urban University in
Washington, DC, three regional undergraduate Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), and a respected and
experienced laboratory training center. A team of MSTEM faculty from Georgetown, North Carolina Central
and Hampton Universities will train and mentor underserved students in aging research topics including health
equity. The program will be enhanced by mentoring and educational activities that include presentations from
experts in Aging Science in the Washington, D.C. area
Awareness, confidence, and mentored lab research training provide students the tools to graduate college with
a science degree and pursue graduate studies in biomedical science. Training programs can be transformative
experiences that introduce students to a new vocabulary of scientific terms, concepts and career development
strategies. The PACT program we propose is designed to provide those key experiences. The goal of the NIA
R25 program is to “encourage individuals from diverse backgrounds to pursue further studies or careers in
biomedical research.” The program proposed is creatively designed to support that goal.
The impact of this program will be the successful training and mentoring of 15 undergraduate students each
year. The trainees will gain facility in research practice and techniques by participating in an intensive
residential 6-day summer laboratory training course at the Georgetown University BioScience training labs.
Lectures and laboratories are designed to highlight aging science topics and use of cell types and reagent kits
and techniques relevant in aging research. Undergraduate trainees will be matched with mentors and train in a
laboratory for an additional 8 weeks in the summer and the academic year. Structured mentoring and career
development activities will continue to be provided with a focus on discovery of career choices in aging
disciplines.
In leveraging the central Washington D.C site, an annual Aging Research forum will be hosted on the GU
campus for trainees and mentors. Research project findings will be presented by summer trainees. The forum
will feature a panel of NIH and Aging experts who will present on topics in Geroscience and Health Equity and
aging career trends and introduce students to further opportunities for training. The PACT program plan will
enhance underserved student participation in bioscience research and provide confidence and exposure to
continue on with a career in aging."
10849155,"Postdoctoral Training Program in Alcohol Studies
This renewal application is for five years of continued support of the Postdoctoral Training Program in Alcohol
Studies at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine (UConn Health). The program was established in
1980 and evolves with this renewal with transitions and additions among training faculty and new resources to
meet the needs of the next generation of scientists committed to understanding and reducing harms from
alcohol use and related consequences. To accomplish this, this program takes a collaborative,
interdisciplinary, and cross-campus (UConn Health, University of Connecticut (UConn-Storrs)) approach with
faculty representing numerous departments including psychiatry, computer science and engineering,
behavioral sciences and community health, medicine, and public health sciences. Our program continues to be
focused on alcohol. It also recognizes that alcohol use, intervention and treatment often occur in the context of
other substance use and comorbidities, and program faculty have substantial expertise in these areas.
Moreover, there is new attention to training opportunities in: mentoring, social determinants of health and
health disparities; data science; mobile technologies; and social media research. Further, while training faculty
have considerable experience in mentoring, supplemental training in best practices in mentoring and
contemporary issues is planned, for faculty and trainees. Throughout, an Executive Advisory Committee
composed of internal and external members will contribute to program oversight and evaluation. This program
provides three postdoctoral fellows with individualized and multimodal training for typically two and up to three
years. Fellows will select from four Core Research Areas in clinical and translational research: (1) Intervention,
Treatment and Recovery; (2) Etiology, Risk Factors and Comorbidities, (3) Health Services, Implementation
Science, and Translational research, and (4) Gut Microbiome, Liver Disease and Immunology. Our Addiction
Science and Principles of Clinical and Translational Research curriculums are examples of formal coursework.
Faculty collaborators and opportunities at external institutions will be available to extend training further.
Fellows will be assigned a primary and possibly a secondary mentor, based on similar research interests
across the core and elective areas. The primary mentor will provide instruction in methods, design, analysis,
and ethics of alcohol research within the trainee's core research area(s) and lead the trainee’s progress on
achieving program and personal professional milestones. Secondary mentors will do the same for their
research area. Expectations for trainees will be to: 1) produce at least two first authored publications per year
of training, 2) initiate and complete an independent or collaborative research project, 3) present research at
RSA and other scientific conferences, and 4) prepare a grant application by the end of the training period.
Given our successes in these objectively measured standards with recent trainees, this program is well-poised
to train the next generation of alcohol researchers."

 Bone fractures contribute significantly to healthcare cost affecting the quality of life. Clinically, fracture risk
can be predicted by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) or the fracture risk assessment (FRAX) tool. Because
type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients exhibit high bone mineral density (BMD), both tools fail to correctly predict
fracture risk, leading to a significant increase of fragility fractures in diabetic subjects. Therefore, there is a
need to investigate how modifications in collagen and other organic components in bone can predict
diabetic fractures. Pentosidine (PEN), a fluorescent Advanced Glycation Endproduct (AGE) that forms in
bone by reaction between sugars and proteins, is the only established marker of bone fragility. However, it
does not consistently predict T2D and fragility fractures. Here, for the first time in bone, we demonstrate the
presence of carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), a non-fluorescent glycoxidative AGE, and present a technique to
measure it. We show that it forms in abundance in bone and is highly correlated to loss of bone toughness.
We demonstrate that, in contrast to other AGEs, CML is upregulated >60% in T2D human bone compared
to their age-matched controls. We then provide evidence that CML promotes formation and growth of
additional hydroxyapatite (HA) crystals, similar to human T2D condition, and forms a ‘molecular link’
between the organic and inorganic components of bone (collagen-HA interface) impairing bone quality. Our
overall hypothesis is that CML is a ‘new and relevant’ biomarker of T2D fracture that captures the
effects of both hyperglycemia and oxidative stress in bone and explains the susceptibility of bone to
fracture in T2D. Using an obese and a non-obese mouse model of T2D, that mimic both causality and
impact of human T2D on bone, we provide evidence that T2D increases AGEs, with CML explaining bone
fragility. Similarly, using data from the Health, Aging and Body Composition (ABC) study we show that
higher serum CML levels are associated with increased risk of incident clinical fractures in T2D,
independent of BMD. Thus, our overall goal is to establish CML as a new and relevant biomarker of bone
fragility and determine how it contributes to bone fragility in T2D. Using in vitro models, ex vivo human
cadaveric tissue, in vivo mouse models of obese and non-obese T2D, and existing data from the Health
ABC study we will pursue there aims: Aim 1: Establish NEG conditions for enhanced formation of CML over
other AGEs and determine the mechanism(s) by which it reduces energy dissipation in bone; Aim 2:
Determine the contribution of CML and other AGEs to alterations in bone matrix and energy dissipation in
human T2D vertebrae and cortical and cancellous bone from hip fracture patients; and Aim 3: Validate CML
as a biomarker of T2D bone fragility and establish its association with hyperglycemia and oxidative stress.
Our findings will provide a new understanding of the mechanism and the effects of CML and other AGEs on
bone fractures leading to new strategies to predict, manage and mitigate T2D and fragility fractures."

The relatively small axial field-of-view (FOV) in almost all PET scanners has severely limited their sensitivity and resulted in significant tradeoffs between image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), acquisition time, and delivered dose. The solution is to improve geometric coverage using large axial FOV for total-body imaging which has the potential to improve sensitivity by about 40 times compared to existing commercial whole-body PET scanners. The construction of the world's first total-body PET/CT scan-ner, called EXPLORER, with 194-cm axial FOV has recently been completed. However, it has a poor time-of-flight (TOF) resolution of 430 ps, compared to the state-of-the-art whole-body PET scanner with 200 ps timing resolution (Siemens Biograph Vision). In addition, axial detector penetration of obliquely incident gamma photons detected within this wide acceptance angle will introduce significant depth-of-interaction (DOI) parallax error, leading to degraded spatial resolution. These two major defi-ciencies of the EXPLORER scanner offset its effective sensitivity gain, specially for imaging single organs such as the human brain when compared to the Biograph Vision PET scanner. For this research, we propose to build cost-effective block detectors with combined highest spatial resolution (2 mm), highest TOF resolution (<120 ps and potentially 100 ps), best DOI localization (1.85 mm), and highest inter- crystal Compton scatter recovery capabilities (88%) using single-ended readout and machine learning post-processing engines. Our novel detector module, called Prism-PET, enables these capabilities by mimicking very closely the behavior of dual-ended readout with enhanced and controlled light sharing using a segmented array of right angle prism-mirror light guides. Given our promising preliminary ex-perimental results, we aim to accomplish the following tasks: (1) model a prototype TOF-DOI PET scanner using GATE Monte Carlo simulations and use its list-mode data to develop our TOF-DOI image recontruction; (2) build Prism-PET detector modules and characterize coincidence detector blocks for DOI-corrected spatial resolution, energy resolution, and timing resolution and use machine learning to recover inter-crystal Compton scattered events to reach the 2-mm intrinsic spatial resolution without sacrificing sensitivity; (3) Build a one-ring prototype Prism-PET scanner; (4) perform normalization scan, optimize our image reconstruction using experimental coincidence events and validate the optimal imaging performance using Hot Spot phantoms. Our proposed TOF-DOI-Compton detector and system technologies maximize the sensitivity benefits of improved geometric coverage in total-body PET scanners across the entire FOV."

The broad objective of this application is to develop a rapid motion-robust and easy-to-use dynamic contrast-
enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) framework for liver perfusion quantification and to evaluate
its performance in quantitative assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most prevalent primary
malignancy in the liver. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) using
gadolinium-based contrast agents is currently a cornerstone for identifying and characterizing hepatic lesions,
including HCC. However, the current clinical use of liver DCE-MRI is limited to visual assessment of the pattern
of perfusion in 3-4 multiphasic images (arterial, venous and delayed phases), and these images are routinely
acquired during multiple breath holds. DCE-MRI also has the potential for quantitative assessment of perfusion
kinetics, which can provide a deeper insight into the tumor microenvironment for non-invasive characterization
of different histological features of the tumor, such as tumor angiogenesis and aggressiveness. This is
particularly relevant for HCC, which is typically diagnosed based on imaging without pathological confirmation
from invasive biopsy. Unfortunately, conventional liver perfusion MRI techniques suffer from a number of
important limitations that restrict its clinical implementation, including (1) slow imaging speed, (2) limited
spatiotemporal resolution, (3) sensitivity to motion artifacts, and (4) time-consuming quantitative perfusion
analysis. Meanwhile, the need for pre-contrast T1 mapping to convert MR signal to gadolinium concentration
further complicates the already-cumbersome imaging workflow. These challenges and underlying complexity
have all led to non-reproducible performance of liver perfusion MRI and have significantly diminished its
ultimate clinical utility. In this project, we propose to develop new rapid MRI techniques combining novel
motion-robust sampling strategies and advanced reconstruction models to address these challenges. The new
imaging techniques will enable motion-robust 3D T1 mapping with whole-liver coverage for efficient estimation
of contrast concentration and free-breathing DCE-MRI of the liver with high spatiotemporal resolution. We will
also incorporate state-of-the-art methods in deep learning to further improve imaging performance, to reduce
reconstruction time, and to substantially simplify perfusion quantification. These new technical developments
will be integrated into a new liver perfusion MRI framework, which will be translated into the clinical setting for
assessment of HCC in an exploratory clinical study. The overall hypothesis is that with the new imaging
framework developed in the project, robust high spatiotemporal resolution perfusion MRI of the liver can be
achieved under free breathing, and absolute quantification of liver perfusion can be performed without user-
interaction. Given the rapidly rising incidence and substantial burden of HCC in the United States, successful
completion of this project would enable significant progress towards improved characterization and
management of HCC and other liver diseases with high clinical impact."
10831782,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The eukaryotic cell has evolved to compartmentalize DNA within the nucleus, surrounded by the barrier of the
nuclear envelope (NE), providing protection to the DNA and a means to control information flow to and from the
genome. This flow, namely the passage of small molecules, RNAs, and proteins across the NE, is mediated by
large, 8-fold symmetrical structures known as nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Arranged as a stack of rings, the
NPC scaffold braces open pores within the NE, yet preserves its barrier function with a dense network of
disordered protein domains, rich in repeating phenylalanine-glycine motifs (FG repeats), known as the NPC
central transporter. The largest NPC cargoes, including pre-ribosomal subunits, mRNPs, and proteasome
subcomplexes, approach the width of the ~55 nm NPC channel in size, yet are able to transit the NPC central
transporter. That such large cargoes can traverse the NPC suggests that organized mechanisms and alternate
structural states of the NPC are required to transport large cargoes through the FG repeat network of the central
transporter. To address these questions, our multi-investigator, multi-site collaborative team recently determined
structures of the affinity isolated S. cerevisiae budding yeast NPC at 8-11 Å resolution and the in situ yeast NPC
at 30-40 Å resolution (Akey et al., 2022). Comparison of “ground state” (isolated) and “active state” (in situ) NPCs
revealed that radial dilation of the NPC scaffold may accommodate changes in cargo flux or size. We now aim
to investigate the dynamics of NPC transport function of model large cargoes that can be targeted for import into
the nucleus and arrested during transport, allowing us to quantify cargo transport dynamics (function) and map
the location of the transiting cargo within the NPC (structure). We will dissect NPC transport’s energy-
dependence on nuclear Ran-GTP into separate studies of passive, Ran-insensitive cargo targeting to the NPC
(Aim 1) and active, Ran-dependent cargo transport through the NPC (Aim 2). Using well-characterized NPC
transport mutants, we will examine the behavior of actively transporting large cargoes by perturbing specific
stages along the transport path (Aim 3). This level of control will allow us to map transport functions not only to
specific Nups, but to specific regions of Nups. Quantitative fluorescence microscopy and cell fitness assays will
screen for functionally important phenotypes to selectively pursue NPC-cargo interactomics by mass
spectrometry and visualization of NPC structural changes by cryo-electron microscopy. Our functional and
structural data will inform each other in a synergistic but non-dependent fashion to reveal how the NPC adopts
distinct and discrete structural states to perform its transport functions for native (mRNPs, pre-ribosomes) and
non-native (viral capsids, nanocarriers) large cargoes. This comprehensive research strategy will advance our
understanding of (i) constitutive large cargo transport processes and malfunction of this process in disease states
(ii) interactions between viral capsids and NPCs during infection and (iii) nuclear-targeting for nanocarriers in
drug delivery and gene therapy."

This AHRQ R18 proposal focuses on evaluating patient-level and clinic-level strategies to increase
implementation of self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) monitoring programs with clinical support;
specifically, we focus on identifying approaches to increase SMBP monitoring in safety net settings where
many low-income and/or culturally diverse populations who experience worse hypertension control and
outcomes receive clinical care. SMBP monitoring is an evidence-based, guideline-recommended practice that
is most effective when combined with clinical support. However, SMBP monitoring with clinical support has had
limited adoption in many safety net clinical settings due to multi-level barriers. To accelerate adoption of SMBP
monitoring with clinical support in safety net settings, we propose to conduct this project in an integrated, urban
safety net healthcare system that provides ambulatory care for >50,000 patients.
In Aim 1, we will co-design patient-level and clinic-level implementation strategies to increase SMBP
monitoring supported by clinical teams. We will conduct three rounds of design sessions in focus groups with
English, Spanish, and Chinese-speaking patients with hypertension and clinical care team members (e.g.,
clinicians, pharmacists, nurses). We will design: (1) two patient-level strategies (a low-intensity strategy of
providing cellular-enabled BP monitors and training on its use vs. a high-intensity strategy that adds reminders,
training on transmitting BP data to the clinical team, and approaches to engage caregivers/peer in SMBP
monitoring activities); and (2) one clinic-level strategy (training of clinical champions and design of electronic
health record [EHR] implementation tools). In Aim 2, we will conduct a hybrid type 2 effectiveness-
implementation trial and evaluate effectiveness and implementation outcomes. A total of 330 patients will be
enrolled for 12 months and randomized to high-intensity vs the low-intensity patient-facing implementation
strategy; six primary care clinics will receive the clinic-level implementation strategy in a stepped wedge
design. For the patient-level strategy, the primary effectiveness outcome will be change in systolic BP at 12
months and primary implementation outcome will be the number of home BP values measures over the 12-
month period. For our clinic-level implementation strategy, the primary effectiveness outcome will be change in
clinic-wide BP control and primary implementation outcome will be the frequency of documenting patient-
collected BP values. Our secondary outcomes include other clinical outcomes, patient-reported outcomes, and
other implementation outcomes, collected from surveys, observations, interviews, and EHR data. In Aim 3, we
will conduct a cost-analysis of our implementation strategies and intervention with a focus on understanding
the costs of implementing an SMBP monitoring program when supported by our implementation strategies.
Data will be collected through surveys, interviews, observations, and review of EHR data."

The biguanide drug metformin that is widely used for the management of Type 2 diabetes is being evaluated as an anti-
neoplastic agent in cancer trials including GBM (NCT02780024, NCT03243851). The various mechanisms of action of
metformin as an anti-neoplastic agent is still being investigated, but recent studies have unequivocally demonstrated that
its therapeutic effects in tumor cell growth, cell death, gene expression, and signaling are dependent on inhibition of
mitochondrial complex I. Based on the success of metformin in combination therapy in some cancers, new generation of
mitochondrial complex I inhibitors (MCI-i) are currently under investigation. Diffusion of metformin across the plasma
membrane occurs slowly. Its entry is facilitated by two transporters OCT1 and OCT2 that are not well expressed outside
the liver and kidney. This presents a problem due its lack of accumulation in other tissues at therapeutic concentrations.
Therefore, identification of tumor subtypes that respond better to lower concentrations of metformin may be leveraged
for targeted metformin therapy. Metformin GBM trials may be unsatisfactory since there are no molecular markers to
distinguish metformin responders from non-responders. Identification of molecular markers may greatly improve
metformin and other MCI-i-based therapy in GBM. We identified that a pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit (PDHA1) is a
possible molecular beacon for MCI-i therapy in GBM. We will test this in vitro and in vivo. We also found that the cellular
energy sensor AMPK provides resistance to MCI-i therapy in a subset of GBM. We will test if a brain-penetrating AMPK
inhibitor restores MCI-i sensitivity in vivo. Lastly, our molecular analysis showed that ErbB activation is a likely mechanism
of resistance to AMPK inhibition. In mouse models we will test if a brain-penetrating ErbB inhibitor overcomes AMPK
inhibitor resistance in vivo."
10836829,"Project Summary: The envelope (Env) glycoprotein exposed on the surface of HIV-1 virions is essential for
virus entry into susceptible cells and is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies, small molecules, and fusion
inhibitors. The structural dynamics of Env promote HIV-1 entering susceptible cells via membrane fusion and
facilitate antibody evasion. However, a lack of knowledge about the time-resolved structural dynamics and
allostery of Env impedes the attempts to comprehend the mechanisms by which Env enables virus entry and
facilitates immune evasion. Env is trimeric, in which each protomer is composed of two subunits: exterior gp120
for binding to cellular receptors/coreceptors and membrane-anchored gp41 for driving fusion. Upon interacting
with cellular receptors/coreceptors, gp120 undergoes large-scale conformational changes, further activating a
series of fusion-promoting structural refolding in gp41. Refolding in gp41 progresses from a prefusion state
through intermediates to the post-fusion that is generally believed to drive membrane fusion. Structures of Env
have provided atomic details of Env conformations at fusion endpoints. However, substantial knowledge gaps in
the Env-mediated fusion mechanism cannot be bridged by conventional structural tools. These gaps include
time, sequence, reversibility, transitional paths, and transient intermediate steps of structural changes of Env.
The proposed research is based on the hypothesis that Env is a highly cooperative dynamic machine in which
conformational changes reflected in gp120 and gp41 during fusion occur in well-ordered spatial and temporal
equilibrium. Single-Molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) studies with fluorescent
labels placed on gp120 demonstrated that native Env intrinsically interchanges between multiple conformations
and has responsive conformational sampling to CD4 activation, neutralizing antibodies, and inhibitors. This
project will elucidate spatiotemporal information of Env in its native state, with focused investigations on the less-
studied gp41 and its association with gp120, and ultimately provide a time-resolved stepwise spatial framework
of the fusion process. Multiple synergic methods, including smFRET in the context of intact virions, an integrated
enhanced sampling molecular dynamics (MD)-smFRET, AI-guided multiscale simulations/modeling for mapping
Env allostery, cell-based virological assays, and photophysical analysis will be used. The research is built upon
recently established minimally invasive smFRET imaging of Env using genetic code expansion combined with
click chemistry. It will be further extended to multi-perspective for monitoring gp120-gp41 associated
cooperativity and capturing structural changes of gp41. The conformational dynamics of Env will be monitored
from three different structural perspectives. Neutralizing antibodies and fusion inhibitors will be used to facilitate
revealing conformational cooperativities of Env and spatiotemporally resolving individual fusion intermediates.
The expected results will provide new insights about the time-resolved structural dynamics and allostery of Env
that can inform the design of Env-centric interventions such as vaccines, antibody therapy, and anti-viral drugs."

Recent insights into HIV-1 Env structure and function are yielding a variety of new approaches aimed at
designing more advanced and novel immunogens for eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) through
vaccination. As improved immunogens enter detailed pre-clinical and clinical studies, it has become critical that
the in vitro assays used for making measurements of vaccine-elicited antibody responses have the ability to
distinguish incremental advances in magnitude, breadth, and durability. Core B (Neutralizing Antibody Core)
will provide standardized and validated GCLP-compliant neutralizing antibody assay services to assist
in the development and evaluation of novel mRNA-based immunogens advanced by this P01 program
and comparison of vaccine-elicited mAbs with existing and newly defined patient-derived bnAbs. These
services will provide critical data that will help guide immunogen design and strategies for vaccine formulation
and delivery proposed in Project 1 and Project 2. To accomplish these goals, we propose the following three
Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: Assess vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibody responses in wildtype and KI mice immunized
 with novel mRNA-based chimeric HIV-1 MPER-TM immunogens.
Specific Aim 2: Screen patient serum samples from HIV-1 infection cohorts to identify individuals with
 MPER-specific neutralizing activity for mAb cloning.
Specific Aim 3: Characterize the breadth and potency of neutralizing activity and ADCC for novel mAbs
 cloned from vaccinated animals and HIV-1 infected patients."
10838922,"Project Summary
An HIV vaccine remains a critical and as yet unrealized asset in the 40-year fight against the HIV/AIDS
pandemic. New insights towards achieving vaccine protection from HIV acquisition may be gained by a
comparative case study of COVID-19 vaccines, which achieved nearly 100% efficacy against a similarly
enveloped, RNA virus with a similarly architected, trimeric, Class I fusion viral spike mechanism. Neutralization
B-cell epitopes exposed at the apex of the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric viral spike correlated clearly and strongly with
protection from viral acquisition, both in humans in the real world/circulating virus setting and in non-human
primate (NHP) preclinical models. We hypothesized that vaccine immunogens could be improved by focusing
antibody responses to two equivalent B-cell epitopes at the HIV/SIV viral spike apex, one an epitope targeted
by neutralizing antibodies (V2b) and one a purely non-neutralization epitope (V2c). In preliminary results, we
showed that removal of the viral spike apical V1 loop segment (DV1-Env) masking the V2c epitope enhanced
protection against viral challenge in both a highly stringent SIV and matched SHIV challenge model, achieving
>90% vaccine efficacy. In further preliminary results, we designed an immunogen displaying only this V2c
epitope in isolation and proved that it was highly immunogenic as an isolated epitope and indeed elicited purely
non-neutralizing antibodies in vivo. The study revealed that V2c contributed to, but was not sufficient on its
own, for protection. In this exploratory study, we pursue the new hypothesis that the combination of the two
HIV, viral-spike apical, B-cell epitopes in a single vaccine can reconstitute an increased level of protection as
observed with COVID-19 vaccines, by synergizing V2c with the V2b neutralization epitope. We will 1) design
and validate a V2b-focused immunogen, and 2) test the precise combination of neutralizing, vaccine-elicited
anti-V2b antibodies with non-neutralizing, cytotoxic, vaccine-elicited V2c antibodies, along with coordinated
cellular immune responses in vivo for their ability to delay viral acquisition as compared to the V2c epitope
alone. Successful results in these two aims could justify a research project on the design and translational
development of a novel, viral-spike-apex-focused, efficacious HIV vaccine."
10838924,"Despite effective viral control by Antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV associated neurocognitive disorder
(HAND)persists in 30-50% of people with HIV (PWH). The pathology of HAND includes white matter (WM)
changes such as decreased myelin sheath thickness, myelin lesions, and abnormal myelin protein expression.
We have found that both HIV infection and a subset of antiretroviral drugs disrupt oligodendrocyte (OL)

compounds attenuate OL differentiation and myelin formation, contributing to CNS dysfunction in
persons with HIV (PWH) on ART. Our in vitro data on the effects of HIV and ART drugs on OL differentiation

ART drug- and HIV-induced changes in WM. Transcriptome studies reported significant induction of transcripts
indicative of activation of the ISR and unfolded protein response coincident with significant decrease in
transcripts encoding regulators of lipid metabolism and specific myelin proteins in WM from PWH on ART. We
have reported that a subset of ART drugs and a model of HIV infection induce the ISR, particularly the Protein
kinase R-Endoplasmic Reticulum Kinase (PERK), in OLs. Our preliminary data demonstrate altered levels of
lipid metabolism enzymes and lipids in response to ART drugs. Both processes correlate with inhibition of OL
differentiation. Numerous studies have demonstrated that ISR kinase PERK regulates lipid metabolism;
however, the role of ISR/PERK-induced stress granule (SG) formation, which are membraneless organelles
containing mRNAs that protect a subset of transcripts during ISR activation, has not been investigated. Our
preliminary data demonstrate the presence of SGs in OLs in WM of PWH with HAND and in OLs exposed to
ART drugs in vitro. These findings have led us to hypothesize that HIV infection and a subset of ART
compounds induce the ISR leading to stress granule formation and disruption of lipid metabolism in OL,
causing defects in differentiation and myelin formation in PWH, contributing to CNS dysfunction. To
address this hypothesis: aim 1 will determine whether HIV or select ART drugs cause the ISR-induced formation
of SGs, which mRNAs critical for myelination are sequestered in SGs, and whether SGs are toxic to the cell.
These goals will be pursued in our well-tested in vitro model of oligodendrocyte differentiation, in a small animal
model and in samples from PWH. In aim 2, we will determine how both HIV and select ART drugs alter lipid
composition and lipid regulation in OLs, also employing our in vitro model, a small animal model and samples
from PWH. We will also determine the impact of ISR on lipid regulation and composition in this system. Finally,
in specific aim 3, we will determine if neuroimaging-based measures of WM health associates with genetic
variants of PERK and lipid metabolism in the context of functional subdomains of cognitive and mental health
changes in PWH."

The University of North Carolina (UNC) Molecular and Cellular Biophysics Program (MCBP) is a successful
interdisciplinary graduate training program with a mission to train a diverse cohort of graduate students to
conduct biomedical research, probing the molecular and cellular processes of life and disease using biophysical
approaches. The MCBP has three core objectives: 1. To attract a diverse cohort of talented graduate students
to apply the methods and concepts of the quantitative and mathematical sciences to problems in biology; 2. To
provide a flexible, equitable vehicle for training this diverse group of graduate students who share with our
biophysics faculty a commitment to developing molecular-level descriptions of complex biological systems and
processes; 3. To foster inclusive interactions and enhance the training and research environment within this
diverse group of students and faculty to best enable and potentiate career trajectories in the biological sciences.
This proposal requests 10 training slots to support 5 students in their second year and 5 students in their third
year of graduate school. The MCBP fulfills a specific need at UNC, uniting graduate students and faculty across
the campus under a comprehensive molecular and cellular biophysics training program. The program selects
students from a variety of UNC graduate school-admitting portals including biological sciences, chemistry, and
physics, that align with the academic diversity of our 36 faculty, who are drawn from 9 departments from across
the School of Medicine, the School of Pharmacy, and the College of Arts and Sciences. Our students and faculty
share an interest in characterizing and modeling the biophysical behavior of macromolecules and cellular
systems. By promoting interactions across biology, physics, and chemistry, MCBP students gain proficiency in
cross-disciplinary science and communication. Students complete rigorous coursework in small classes rooted
in the theory, and application of biophysics. Students become trained in the responsible conduct of research and
rigor and reproducibility. Specific training includes core classes in the principles of the molecular and
thermodynamic behavior of macromolecules, elective courses in methods to investigate macromolecular
structure and function and behavior, both in vitro and in cells, and a seminar class in biophysics where students
are trained in scientific presentations, communication and critique, attend seminars, and meet with visiting
speakers. The MCBP further promotes student development through the Biophysics Colloquium, by hosting a
biennial North Carolina Biophysics Symposium, a class in written communication, career panels with program
graduates, and via student advising. Over its 28-year history, MCBP graduates have used the skills they
developed in the program to become leaders in research and education across academics and industry."

Though significant epidemiological evidence highlights the significantly worse outcomes for HIV and tuberculosis
(TB) co-infections, the mechanisms underlying this increased risk have not been identified. This is particularly
important since all-cause mortality is four times higher for people living with HIV (PLHIV) that also have a history
of active TB compared to PLHIV without TB, regardless of TB cure and effective ART. This research team's

etiology of increased all-cause mortality in PLHIV who have had active pulmonary TB.
The goal of Aim 2 is to determine HIV proviral burdens in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-specific CD4+ T-

people living with HIV with (n=10) vs without (n=10) history of TB will have 5 billion white blood cells collected

in CD4 cells responsive to different antigenic stimuli. Digital droplet PCR will be used to measure the percentage
of CD4 cells containing HIV. We hypothesize that Mtb peptide-responsive CD4 will be most likely to contain HIV
provirus, and thus contribute to the larger HIV reservoir seen in HIV-TB coinfection. Fundamental understanding
of TB's impact on HIV reservoir will have significant impact on HIV cure options in areas with high rates of TB."
10839225,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programs have limited effectiveness in Sub-Saharan
Africa, where the vast majority of perinatal infections occur and nearly half of children with HIV remain
undiagnosed. Many social and structural barriers have been well described that prevent uptake of the WHO-
recommended HIV testing during pregnancy, perinatal period, and throughout breastfeeding. We hypothesize
that engaging with traditional healers (TH), who provide informal care to the majority of children in African
communities, may be an effective way to increase HIV testing among this vulnerable population. In our prior
cluster randomized trial, we showed that partnerships with Ugandan TH quadrupled the uptake of HIV testing
in rural Ugandan adults through facilitation of HIV counseling and self-testing at TH practices. Given that rapid
oral swab HIV tests are approved for individuals 18 months or older, we propose an innovative approach to
improve pediatric HIV testing by adapting our previously successful TH-facilitated HIV testing program for
children 18 months to 5 years of age. This work will be guided by the EPIS implementation framework, and we
propose the following two Specific Aims:
• Aim 1: Determine key barriers and facilitators to HIV testing in order to adapt a TH-facilitated HIV
 testing program for pediatric clients 18 months-5 years of age who receive care from Ugandan TH. We
 will conduct individual interviews with members of the following stakeholder groups: caretakers of children
 under five who receive care from TH, TH who routinely provide care for children under five, and HIV
 clinicians. Interviews will assess drivers of pediatric HIV testing, acceptability of a TH-delivered program,
 and guide adaptation of our TH-facilitated intervention following the evidence-based ADAPT-ITT method.
• Aim 2: Pilot test a TH-facilitated HIV testing intervention for pediatric clients 18 months to 5 years of
 age. Five TH will be trained to deliver pediatric-specific HIV counseling and facilitate HIV testing via oral
 swab antigen tests for eligible pediatric clients. We will pilot test the adapted program by enrolling 200
 pediatric clients of TH. The primary outcome is uptake of an HIV test offered by the TH. We hypothesize
 that 75% of eligible pediatric clients will receive an HIV test at their TH practice site. Qualitative exit
 interviews with participating TH and a purposive sample of 20 participant caregivers will be conducted to
 examine program acceptability and identify modifications needed for scale up.
This study would be the first to implement TH-facilitated HIV testing among pediatric clients. Rationale for this
work is that TH can improve the uptake of HIV testing among pediatric populations and fill the gaps of
current PMTCT programs. If effective, expanding this strategy across sub-Saharan Africa could lead to
hundreds of thousands more children living with HIV being aware of their status and could thereby prevent
thousands of AIDS-related deaths among this vulnerable population."
10845602,"ABSTRACT
Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death and disability and results in substantial economic
burden. Estimates suggest that 13.7% of adults in the United States (US) are current smokers. Yet, tobacco use
is not equally distributed in society. African American smokers evince elevated smoking rates (14.6%) and are
significantly more likely to use menthol cigarettes, which are associated with a host of flavor-specific negative
health outcomes. Additionally, African American smokers are less likely to maintain cessation compared to
European American and Latinx smokers despite making more quit attempts. A major contributing factor to
smoking among African Americans appears to be their increased exposure to interoceptive-stress symptoms.
Consequently, cessation interventions directed toward African American smokers might benefit from specific
focus on increasing the ability to adaptively respond to interoceptive stress (e.g., anxiety, bodily sensations,
stress-related burden due to racism or discrimination during a quit attempt and thereafter). Notably, motives
for smoking to cope with negative mood states are central to cigarette use among those with greater sensitivity
to stress (i.e., higher anxiety sensitivity [AS]; a well-established malleable, transdiagnostic construct for
emotional symptoms and disorders and the maintenance of smoking). Past work has not leveraged the
potential of AS to better understand smoking and interoceptive stress relations among this established health
disparities group. The present proposal aims to refine and comprehensively culturally adapt an initially tested
novel, mobile intervention that targets AS among African American smokers (Mobile Anxiety Sensitivity
Program for Smoking: MASP). Our intervention is framed within the cultural context of interoceptive stress
among African American smokers, which is supported by theory, empirical evidence, and characteristics of this
group. In Phase I, we will further culturally tailor our preliminarily test treatment (MASP 1.0) with African
American-smoking content and history to develop MASP 2.0, which will be pilot tested during this phase. In
Phase I, 25 African American smokers with elevated AS will be administered MASP 2.0 for 6 weeks. Following
completion of Phase I, we will further refine MASP 2.0 based on qualitative and quantitative data from
participants and the research team to produce MASP 3.0. In Phase II, 200 African American smokers with
elevated AS will be enrolled and randomly assigned to either: (1) the smartphone-based National Cancer
Institute (NCI) QuitGuide app for standard mobile smoking cessation treatment (2) MASP 3.0. Participants in
Phase I and Phase II will complete an in-person baseline assessment, pre- and post-quit ecological momentary
assessments, an end-of-treatment qualitative interview, and follow-up assessments at weeks 1, 2 (quit date), 3,
4, 5, 6, 28, and 54 (52 weeks post-quit) via the app as well as receive nicotine replacement therapy."
10851900,"Admin Core Summary/Abstract
To operate a cohesive, coordinated and effective Program Project, the clinical, research, technology,
database/statistics and reporting components of the program require central coordination. The Administrative
Core of the proposed third renewal of this Program Project (PPG4) provides the organizational structure and
integration of the Program Project Cores and research. Another administrative function critical for success is to
liaison with other research programs on which the Program Project relies for success. In the case of PPG4, all
subjects will be recruited to the Clinical Core from two sources: 1) the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer’s
disease Research Center (ADRC) and 2) The Pitt+Me® Research Participant Registry. The PPG4
Administrative Core will interface with the Administrative Core of the ADRC, which is now in its 36th year and is
a large and smoothly functioning clinical and basic research entity. PPG4 greatly leverages the ADRC
operations and facilitiating this interaction is the fact two mPIs of PPG4, Dr. Cohen and Dr. Aizenstein both
serves as Core/ Component directions within the ADRC and Dr. Ikonomovic and Dr. Villemagne both serve as
co-Investigators within the ADRC. Further, co-Investigator, Dr. Lopez is the Co-director of the ADRC, along
with co-Investigator Dr. Kofler. Also very important is the fact that Dr. Snitz, co-Leader of the Clinical Core of
PPG4 (and of PPG3), serves as the supervising neuropsychologist in the ADRC. Furthermore, Leslie Dunn
serves as the overall Administrator for both the ADRC and this Program Project. This continuity will allow for
the subjects to experience a relatively seamless transition into the PPG4 research program. The Administrative
Core provides the organizational structure and leadership for planning and implementation of all activities
aimed at the fulfillment of the Program Project aims. The specific aims of the Administrative Core are: (1)
Supervision of all Program Project functions (scheduling meetings, setting and evaluating milestones, data
requests, resolving conflict and ensuring open communication among Program Project investigators and staff).
(2) Management of Program Project budget, including expenditures and allocation of funds according to
Program Project priorities and distribution of Core resources. (3) Monitor compliance with Federal and
University policies and procedures, such as NIH Public Access Policy, Data Sharing Plan, and Conflict of
Interest. (4) Monitor compliance with Human subjects research, including liaising with University of Pittsburgh
Human Research Protections Office, the University of Pittsburgh Education and Compliance Support for
Human Subject Research. (5) Manage all reporting to the University of Pittsburgh Human Research
Protections Office, the Food and Drug Administration ([18F]MK6240, [11C]PiB, and [18F]SMBT-1 INDs);
Cerveau ([18F]MK6240 MTA). (6) Administrative oversight of the Program Project Database. (7) Liaise with the
University of Pittsburgh ADRC in the Department of Neurology. (8) Organize External Advisory Meetings."
10851902,"Clinical Core Summary/Abstract
The Clinical Core of the Program Project Grant (PPG) has provided clinical, cognitive and
cognitive diagnostic adjudications, and coordinated autopsies for the past three cycles of the
PPG. For the 4th cycle of the PPG (PPG4), the Clinical Core continues this crucial responsibility
providing clinical and cognitive diagnostic classifications that are critical to the aims and
hypotheses of the Projects. The Clinical Core is primarily responsible for participant recruitment,
clinical evaluation and autopsy coordination. The Clinical Core will recruit 300 older adults over
the first two years and conduct annual clinical and cognitive assessments. Clinical assessments
include annual neuropsychological testing, medical history and neurological examination, and
assessments of function, behavior and mood, all of which will be used in the adjudication of
cognitive diagnostic classifications in support of Projects 1, 2, 3 and 4. Cognitive diagnoses are
adjudicated at biweekly diagnostic case conferences by a multi-disciplinary team from the
Clinical Core. The Clinical Core also conducts assessments of vascular risk (arterial stiffness,
carotid artery ultrasonography, and vascular endothelial function measures) and sleep (sleep
diary, actigraphy, and polysomnography) at baseline, and 24- and 48-months, in support of
Projects 1 and 2. The Clinical Core works with the Imaging Biomarker and Methodology Core
and the Fluid Biomarker and Methodology Core, providing participants and coordinating
scheduling and logistics for imaging and biofluid biomarker data to be obtained by these
respective Cores. The Clinical Core transfers all clinical, cognitive, behavioral, vascular and
sleep data to the Biostatistics and Data Management Core, and assists in merging these data
with the imaging and fluid biomarker data. Finally, building on prior experience in coordinating
autopsy cases, the Clinical Core confirms provisional autopsy intent and coordinates the
logistics for any new autopsy cases in support of Project 4."
10851905,"IBM Core Summary/Abstract
Since 2005, the Imaging, Methodology, and Statistics (IMS) core described in earlier cycles of
this PPG has provided projects with broad support for PET and MR image analyses, data
management, and statistical expertise. Progress over the last 15 years has resulted in the
evolution of a comprehensive data analysis infrastructure for PET and MR imaging studies in
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related disorders at the University of Pittsburgh, supported by a
large number of faculty and staff who have developed considerable technical expertise in the field
of AD imaging. In this cycle (PPG4), the previous functions of the IMS core (PPG1-3) will be more
efficiently divided across the Imaging Biomarkers and Methodologies (IBM) Core described here
and the Biostatistics and Data Management (BDM) Core. The IBM Core will concentrate imaging
resources and expertise to provide PPG4 projects and investigators with a broad range of imaging
tools, methods, and technical expertise to support PET, high-field (3T) and ultra-high field (7T)
MR imaging. The IBM Core will be responsible for the acquisition, analysis, and quality control of
all PET and MR image data collected in support of PPG4 projects, and will maintain a direct
interface with the BDM Core to facilitate the efficient transfer of raw and processed PET and MR
images and imaging outcomes, which include PET indices of amyloid, tau, and astroglial
pathologic burden, as well as 7T MR measures of cortical thickness, regional volumes, and
cerebrovascular disease burden, to the BDM Core, which we will assist with tasks related to the
interpretation and dissemination of images and image outcomes. The IBM Core will continue to
hold weekly meetings with other PPG researchers to discuss PET and MR data acquisition,
processing, analyses, and general methodology issues, as well as to identify and adequately
resource opportunities to develop novel PET and 7T MR imaging methodologies with the potential
to positively impact PPG4 research and the field more broadly. The IBM Core will also continue
to provide training to students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty in neuroimaging methods."
10851906,"FBM Core Summary/Abstract
Recent advances in ultrasensitive blood biomarker assays for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathophysiology
suggest that plasma biomarkers can revolutionize AD research and clinical practice. The Fluid Biomarker and
Methodology (FBM) Core was created in PPG4 in response to these advances and will be responsible for
coordinating blood collections, pre-analytical procedures, banking, analysis, and supplying continuous blood
biomarker values to the projects. The FBM Core will generate results for all projects and will be integrated with
all other cores. We will provide quality-controlled results of blood biomarkers in a format that can be easily used
by projects for the analyzes associated with their aims. In collaboration with the neuroimaging and
neuropathology teams, we will contribute to the validation of plasma biomarker assays previously developed by
FBM Core team members and other groups against better-validated neuroimaging and postmortem outcomes.
The FBM Core will seek to collaborate with several large-scale multi-site studies in the field of AD and related
dementia to advance the knowledge of blood biomarkers using a big data approach. We will hold monthly
meetings with other PPG researchers to discuss blood collection and analysis, as well as to discuss
methodological and scientific aspects of blood biomarkers. The FBM Core will also provide training for students,
postdocs, and faculty in fluid biomarker methods and analyses. It is important to emphasize that the optimization
of neuroimaging biomarker techniques in the previous PPG cycles has placed the FBM Core in a privileged
position to use these state-of-art neuroimaging outcomes to support the measures obtained with the new blood
biomarker assays. The specific aims of the FBM Core are: (Aim 1) To coordinate the collection, pre-analytical
procedures, storage, and analysis of blood plasma biomarkers across the PPG4. (Aim 2) To provide quality-
controlled plasma biomarker values of Aβ, tau, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation in support of the aims
described in detail in Projects 1-4. (Aim 3) In collaboration with the Imaging Biomarkers Methodology Core, we
aim to validate plasma biomarker assays against neuroimaging outcomes. (Aim 4) In collaboration with the
neuropathology team (Project 4), we aim to validate plasma biomarker assays against postmortem pathological
outcomes. (Aim 5) To train students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty in plasma biomarker methods. In the
present study, we will generate the first large-scale longitudinal dataset with blood and neuroimaging measures
of astrogliosis, Aβ, tau, and neurodegeneration. The results generated by the projects with the data provided by
the FBM Core will help to elucidate the complex interactions between multiple pathologies in AD. The validation
of blood biomarker measurements against better-established neuroimaging and postmortem outcomes will
indicate the advantages and caveats of using these plasma biomarkers to identify brain pathologies in AD."

The Biostatistics and Data Management (BDM) Core will be responsible to provide PPG4
projects and investigators with a broad range of statistical and data management expertise. The
BDM Core will be responsible for creating, maintaining and seamlessly integrating all collected
data (clinical, imaging, biomarkers) in this PPG4, as well as the statistical analysis proposed for
each project (correlations, linear regression, path analysis, longitudinal analysis, high-
dimensional associations). The BDM core will closely work with the PPG4 Investigators and
provide datasets and analysis for each specific hypothesis and will provide investigators with
datasets upon request in a format that is easy to use with any statistical analysis program. The
BDM Core will work closely with the Imaging Biomarkers Methodology (IBM) Core to facilitate
the efficient transfer of raw and processed PET and MR images and imaging outcomes
(measures of cortical thickness, regional volumes, and cerebrovascular disease burden) so that
the BDM Core can provide data analysis as well as interpretation and dissemination of
associations related to imaging outcomes. Similarly, the BDM core will facilitate the integration
of the rest of the outcomes (that are not-high-dimensional), cognitive, blood, etc. collected from
the other cores to be integrated in the database and used in subsequent analyses. BDM Core
will hold weekly Core meetings to discuss data integration in the database, data requests,
analysis plans as well as general methodology issues as they arise. The BDM Core will provide
training to students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty in data analysis with focus on analysis
methods used in the PPG. In addition, the BDM core will organize monthly seminars with a
focus on specific topics with instructional purposes for graduate students and postdocs involved
in the PPG4."
10851909,"Project 1 Summary/Abstract:
Our project plan addresses critical questions regarding the pathophysiology of
AD. We will investigate the relationship between reactive astrogliosis, AD pathology, cerebrovascular disease
and neurodegeneration using the unique resource of a well-characterized cohort, novel radiotracers, and state-
of-the-art approaches. Our planned cohort of 300 participants provides us with a unique opportunity to examine
the pathophysiological mechanisms that lead to cognitive disability in the elderly. The novelty of this proposal
lies in the imaging of regional reactive astrogliosis to better define the relationship of neuroimmune response to
aggregation of Aβ and tau, vascular disease, neurodegeneration and cognitive decline across the AD spectrum
from cognitively unimpaired to dementia. This is possible due to the recent development and validation of the
first F-18 labelled MAO-B tracer to be used as a surrogate marker of reactive astrogliosis. There are very few
longitudinal studies in a position to examine the long-term effects of reactive astrogliosis across the AD
continuum. We will be the first to combine cross-sectional and longitudinal in vivo imaging of regional reactive
astrogliosis and to examine its association with vascular disease, Aβ and tau pathology, brain structure/function,
and cognition, to study the brain changes that precede the onset of the cognitive symptoms. Moreover, we will
complement our neuroimaging assessments with plasma evaluations of astrogliosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein
-GFAP-), AD pathology (both Aβ and p-tau-181; p-tau-231, p-tau-217-), and neurodegeneration (Neurofilament
Light). A better characterization of individuals at the preclinical and prodromal stages through markers of
pathology and reactive gliosis will allow accurate identification of individuals at risk of developing the disease.
Our preliminary data suggests that imaging of reactive astrogliosis reveals an earlier neuroimmune response
and will better inform us on the relationship to the other pathological features of AD. Using a novel PET MAO-B
tracer, our team will be the first to collect and integrate this critical information. Our findings will directly
translate to primary and secondary prevention strategies. The delay of clinical dementia by even as little as 18-
24 months will have a substantial societal and economic benefit to the patients, families, and society as a whole."
10851911,"Project 2 Summary/Abstract
Health risk factors such as cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) and poor sleep are thought to increase the risk
of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). While the mechanisms linking CVRF and poor sleep with AD pathology remain
unclear, neuroinflammation such as astrogliosis, may be one such pathway.
CVRF has consistent links to AD pathology: during the past 10 years of this program project, we explored the
relationship of Aβ deposition alone and in combination with vascular modulators to neuronal dysfunction, and
their association with progression to cognitive impairment and AD. We identified associations of increased
arterial stiffness, systolic blood pressure, and cholesterol homeostasis with increases in Aβ burden
In addition to CVRF, sleep is implicated as a risk factor for AD. Sleep has well-established links to brain
structures and pathways implicated in AD, and is essential to cognitive, immune, and other physiological
functions. Age- and disease-related sleep changes may influence the accumulation of AD pathology21, 22.
Sleep loss is associated with increased levels of Aβ in the interstitial space, and influences kinetics of Aβ and
tau in the cerebrospinal fluid. We and others have demonstrated that poor sleep quality and lower objective
sleep efficiency (see preliminary data) are associated with greater Aβ burden. Moreover, through this program
project, we found a stronger association between Aβ and forgetting in those with poorer sleep efficiency.
Together, these data suggest that CVRF and poor sleep may create a state of vulnerability to AD pathology.
Nonetheless, the mechanisms by which these health factors can create this increased vulnerability to AD
remain unclear. One potential mediating factor is neuroinflammation. Cellular inflammation plays a well-
established role in AD pathology. Inflammation has established links with CVRF, hypertension, and stroke risk.
Similarly, sleep loss induces a 3-fold increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines, which contribute to the
homeostatic drive for SWA. Moreover, chronic poor sleep leads to a cascade of chronic neuroinflammation
including astrogliosis and microglial activation. Together, these data suggest that CVRF and poor sleep may
accelerate the process of Aβ deposition partially through neuroinflammation. The overarching goal Project 2
is to understand the role of astrogliosis, as a marker of neuroinflammation, in the relationship between
health risk factors (CVRF and sleep) and the trajectory of AD pathophysiology. In 300 participants we will
complete longitudinal assessments of: 1) Clinical vascular measures of CVRF and sleep efficiency and SWA
assessed with actigraphy and polysomnography; 2) Astrogliosis using PET (SMBT-1) and plasma (GFAP); and
3) AD pathology including Aβ-PET, plasma Aβ, tau PET, and plasma tau. We will examine cross-sectional and
longitudinal associations of CVRF and sleep with pathology and the mediating role of astrogliosis. We will
explore whether changes in CVRF, sleep, and astrogliosis precede accumulation of AD pathology."
10851912,"Project 3 Abstract
Intriguing evidence implicates reactive astrogliosis as impairing brain fluid dynamics (BFD) via multiple
mechanisms, including 1) altering expression of the aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) water channel along the astrocytic end
feet which line perivascular spaces and 2) modifying cerebrovascular vasomotion, a likely driver of perivascular
fluid flow. In turn, impaired BFD may lead to reduced clearance of β-amyloid (Aβ), resulting in aggregation and
Aβ plaque deposition. However, the temporal order of reactive astrogliosis, altered AQP-4 expression, impaired
BFD, and Aβ deposition along the aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathophysiological spectrum is not well
understood. These relationships and mechanisms, particularly the pathways from reactive astrogliosis to
impaired BFD and from impaired BFD to Aβ deposition, remain largely unexamined in vivo in humans. Our
preliminary data examining PET ventricular CSF efflux suggest that BFD are impaired early in the
pathophysiological spectrum, prior to cognitive decline, and are associated with Aβ deposition. These findings
together with growing evidence from animal model and postmortem studies lead us to believe that in vivo
neuroimaging markers of impaired BFD and reactive astrogliosis can predict future Aβ deposition. In order to
test this overall hypothesis and achieve the proposed aims, we will examine (1) brain fluid pulsatility over the
whole head at cardiac, respiratory, and vasomotion frequencies using a novel 7T MRI fast echo-planar imaging
(EPI) sequence; (2) ventricular CSF efflux using the Aβ PET tracer 11C-PiB; (3) enlarged perivascular space
morphology, potentially indicative of impaired BFD, using 7T MRI T1, T2, and FLAIR sequences; (4) reactive
astrogliosis using the novel monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) PET tracer 18F-SMBT-1; and (5) Aβ deposition using
11C-PiB in a cohort of n=300 older adults (age 55 and older; 10% AD). With this data, we will perform a highly
innovative and comprehensive multimodal characterization of in vivo BFD in relation to reactive astrogliosis and
Aβ deposition. Cross-sectionally, we will examine the mediating relationship of BFD between reactive astrogliosis
and Aβ deposition. Longitudinally, we will test the hypothesis that baseline markers of reactive astrogliosis and
impaired BFD can predict follow-up Aβ deposition. In collaboration with Project 4, we will also examine the role
AQP-4 expression plays in regulating BFD. In addition, we will develop a novel non-contrast blood-brain barrier
(BBB) permeability MRI sequence at 7T and examine its relationships with existing BFD neuroimaging markers.
At the conclusion of this proposed study, we will have potentially identified BFD and reactive astrogliosis
neuroimaging markers as predictors of Aβ deposition. We will therefore have potentially identified pathways and
mechanisms for targeted therapies to prevent Aβ deposition and the onset of AD."
10851914,"Project 4 Summary/Abstract:
The main goal of Project-4 is to provide postmortem neuropathological
evaluation of the recently developed SMBT-1 ligand which, due to high affinity for monoamine oxidase B (MAO-
B), is a novel positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer for imaging astrogliosis in Alzheimer’s disease
(AD). We propose a series of postmortem studies to determine regional patterns of SMBT-1 binding in relation
to MAO-B, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and other markers of reactive astrocytes, as well as amyloid-β
(Aβ) and tau pathology and synaptic loss in cases with different levels of AD neuropathologic changes. We will
accomplish this using autopsy brains banked during previous PPG2&3 cycles, and brains from new PPG4
participants who will be imaged with 18F-SMBT-1 as well as amyloid and tau PET ligands 11C-PiB and 18F-MK-
6240, respectively.
 In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that on postmortem brain sections, 3H-SMBT-1 autoradiography and a
novel fluorescent derivative of SMBT-1 (cyano-SMBT-1) correspond strongly to MAO-B/GFAP reactive
astrocytes and are associated more closely with Aβ pathology than tau pathology. Complementary analyses of
frozen brain homogenates from the same regions/cases will characterize 3H-SMBT-1 binding in relation to MAO-
B and GFAP protein levels, Aβ and tau concentrations, and binding levels of 3H-PiB and 3H-MK-6240.
 In Aim 2, we will determine associations of astrogliosis markers, and Aβ and tau pathologies, with regional
synaptic density (a strong correlate of cognition) on postmortem brain sections. Biochemical assays will
determine associations of 3H-SMBT-1 binding, astrogliosis-related proteins, 3H-PiB and 3H-MK-6240 binding
levels, and Aβ and tau concentrations with regional levels of synaptic proteins in the same brain homogenates.
 In Aim 3, we propose the first imaging-to-autopsy validation study of 18F-SMBT-1 PET as an imaging
biomarker of astrogliosis, and its relation to Aβ and tau pathology, in autopsy brains from the PPG4 participants
imaged with 18F-SMBT-1, 11C-PiB, and 18F-MK-6240 PET in Projects 1 and 2. Matching of regions-of-interest
on PET scans and postmortem brain slabs will be optimized using ex-vivo 7T MR imaging of autopsy brains. We
will also determine how postmortem measures of MAO-B/GFAP and aquaporin-4 correlate with region-matched
antemortem analyses of brain fluid dynamics and blood brain barrier using 7T MRI in Project-3. Postmortem
analyses of astrogliosis and cytokines in brain tissues will be correlated with biomarkers of inflammation in blood
samples collected antemortem from the same subjects.
 These studies will involve close interactions of Project-4 with other Projects in the PPG, and will contribute
new knowledge regarding 18F-SMBT-1 PET as a potentially valuable addition to the neuroimaging panel for AD."
10851918,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sub-Saharan Africa carries a disproportionate burden of HIV, with 69% of infections globally, as well as a high
burden of virally induced malignancies, even before the HIV epidemic. Currently a third of all cancers in Sub-
Saharan Africa are virally induced. While data from Africa are scant, evidence from other parts of the world
indicates that with increasing rates of treatment with combination antiretroviral therapy for persons living with
HIV (PLWH), the incidence of HIV-associated malignancies (i.e., Kaposi’s Sarcoma, non-Hodgkin’s
Lymphoma) has declined dramatically. However, cancers caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), specifically
invasive cervical cancer and anal cancer, have not declined and may have increased.
Investigations of HPV-related malignancies are heavily dependent on laboratory testing and histopathology,
which can be implemented in resource limited settings. The Rwanda/DRC/Einstein HIV-Associated HPV-
Malignancies Research Center (HAMRC) proposed in this application will extend both the geographic and the
scientific scope of our research and capacity-building activities. We will leverage our existing HIV research
partnerships in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to include much desired research capacity to assess
HPV-related cancers in PLWH.
The Center proposes major studies of HPV-related malignancies through two projects: 1) evaluating the impact
of HPV prophylactic vaccination in young women living with HIV; and 2) assessing HPV infection and disease
in Congolese (DRC) and Rwandan men who have sex with men with and without HIV infection. In both studies
we will investigate the interactions of HPV infection and disease with the local microbial flora. The Shared
Resources Core addresses the goal of the HAMRC by fostering sustainable research capacity in Rwanda and
the DRC to support investigation of viral-associated cancers. Thus, the specific aims of the Shared
Resources Core are to provide rigorous molecular diagnostic analyses to support studies of the impact of both
HAMRC projects, and to increase capacity to conduct research in HPV-related malignancies in PLWH in
Rwanda and the DRC, and will specifically:
 1. Replicate in the Pathology Laboratory at Université Protestante au Congo, the real-time PCR platform
 for hrHPV typing previously established at Rwanda Military Hospital (RMH), in the Einstein/RMH
 Research Laboratory.
 2. Develop at the Rwanda Military Hospital (RMH), in the Einstein/RMH Research Laboratory, and in
 collaboration with the University of Rwanda, next generation sequencing.
 3. Support further development of ELISA testing in Rwanda, at the Einstein/RMH Research Laboratory,
 using an assay to measure anti-HPV16 and HPV18 IgG antibody titers implementing a protocol
 established by the Frederick National Laboratory of Cancer Research HPV Serology Laboratory.
The proposed capacity building will include personnel development of both research staff and investigators and
will efficiently leverage existing research infrastructure previously developed in large part by the efforts of the
proposed HARMC leadership."

10852879,"Core B: Animal Core Summary
One of the synergistic aspects of the current Program Project is that all of the individual projects
will evaluate some aspect of their research questions in several common models, e.g.,
intracardiac and intratibial injection of tumor cells. Having common animal models allows us to
rapidly translate findings from one project to another project. Due to the unique nature of bone
compared to soft tissues, many models of bone metastasis are challenging and require special
expertise. The Animal Core has provided extensive service to the Program in the previous
grant cycle. The goal of the Animal Core, which has rated Superior, in previous reviews, is to
continue to provide investigators of each project with assistance in the conduct of research
involving animals including establishment of unique animal models (e.g., vertebral body
implants known as vossicles), intracardiac and intratibial injection, in vivo and ex vivo tumor
imaging and miscellaneous animal procedures. The core has been very successful achieving its
goals and has always rated Superior in reviews. To continue to accomplish support of the
Program the Animal Core has the following Aims:
Aim 1. Creating and assessing animal models to be used for the projects. In addition to
routine animal modeling, we will facilitate use of animal models unique to bone metastasis
research or that are challenging. For example, implantation of vertebrae to create vossicles,
intratibial injections, intracardiac injections and orthotopic implants will be performed by the
Animal Core.
Aim 2. Assisting with animal experiments. Core personnel will coordinate and assist or
instruct in the performance of standardized procedures such as in vivo imaging, intracardiac
injections, compound injections, anesthesia, etc.
Aim 3. Imaging animals. The core will assist with imaging including faxitron radiographs,
bioluminescent imaging, bone density (DEXA) scanning and CT.
Aim 4. Providing expertise in use of animal models and interpretation of data from these
animals. Dr. Evan Keller, a Board-certified veterinary oncologist and Dr. Jill Keller, a Board-
certified laboratory animal veterinarian, will provide expertise in interpretation of animal models
as needed.
Aim 5. Ensuring all animal experiments have appropriate animal compliance. In
collaboration with Administrative core, we will ensure that all experiments are performed under
appropriate institute approval"
10852882,"CORE C: Bone Core Abstract
The Bone Core of the Program Project will provide shared facilities and services for procuring,
processing and interpretation of tissues from both clinical samples and animal models utilized in
all projects of the program. This will be achieved through the following aims:
 Aim 1. Experimental design/consultation. This include methods regarding endpoint
analyses and abilities and limitations of methods.
 Aim 2. Pathological interpretation. For histologic specimens, histopathology and
scoring of immunohistochemistry.
 Aim 3. Processing of tissues. Both osseous tissues and pooling resources for soft
tissue processing. This includes fixation, decalcification, paraffin embedding and sectioning of
decalcified sections and fixation, plastic embedding and sectioning of undecalcified sections.
 Aim 4. Routine and special stains for mineralized tissues. This includes for
mineralized tissues, osteoclasts and immunohistochemistry.
 Aim 5. Histomorphometric analysis of both osseous sections and tumor tissue.
This includes measurement of specific bone-related structural and cellular parameters.
 Aim 6. Procurement of clinical tissue samples. Bone marrow samples for
disseminated tumor cells isolation and blood for circulating tumor cells and serum as needed.
 Core support of these services will promote efficiency of specimen analysis and facilitate
interactions between projects through the similar model systems and their common analyses. A
significant benefit to the program as a group will be a standardized format for analysis of
specimens from the common animal models that will be using different experimental
approaches/targets. This will provide valuable information that can be shared and compared
across the projects in the program. To accomplish these goals, the core is directed by Dr.
Kenneth Kozloff, who is an expert in bone biology. In addition, the core is supported by Dr.
Rohit Mehra, a board-certified urologic oncology pathologist and Dr. Todd Morgan, a urologist
and physician scientist with expertise in disseminated tumor cell procurement and biology.

Project Summary Abstract
Oncogenic viruses cause 15-20% of human cancers. High-risk HPVs are associated with 5% of cancers,
including cervical cancer (CC) as well as an increasing number of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas
(OSCC). RNA molecules, such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and co-transcriptional R-loops (RNA:DNA
hybrids) are associated with genomic instability and other hallmarks of cancer, but are understudied in the
context of HPV infection. Our preliminary data indicate high-risk HPV31 positive cells have increased levels of
R-loops compared to uninfected cells. Furthermore, we have identified several lncRNAs that are altered by
HPV31 that influence epithelial differentiation, proliferation and survival. Whether these RNA molecules serve a
pro-viral role and/or contribute to HPV pathogenesis is unclear. The DNA tumor viruses EBV and KSHV are also
found in the oral cavity and cause oral cancers. Similarly to HPV, EBV and KSHV also use differentiation of the
oral epithelium as a mechanism to activate lytic replication and virus production. Oral epithelial cells are the likely
source of infectious virus in the saliva and a critical component of viral pathogenesis. However, the mechanisms
that regulate the productive replication of HPV, as well as the latent/lytic phases of EBV and KSHV in the oral
epithelium are not well characterized. These viruses likely employ similar strategies to uncouple proliferation
from differentiation to promote both viral persistence and viral spread. KSHV and EBV alter the host lncRNA
profile in other cell types, and R-loop forming sequences have been identified in KSHV and EBV viral genomes.
Additionally, we have found that KSHV induces R-loop formation and DNA damage in oral epithelial cells. We
hypothesize that HPV, EBV and KSHV reprogram the epithelial cell environment through R-loop
formation/distribution and lncRNA expression in order to support the viral life cycle. Specific Aims to test this
hypothesis are: (1) Determine the role of R-loops in HPV and KSHV pathogenesis by mapping R-loop distribution
on cellular and viral DNA and determining if R-loops contribute to DNA damage in infected cells; (2) Determine
how cellular lncRNAs contribute to the life cycle of HPV as well as KSHV and EBV in epithelial cells through a
biased approach of overexpression/depletion studies of specific lncRNAs, and an unbiased approach through
high throughput sequencing to examine global alterations in lncRNA expression. Understanding how R-loops
and lncRNAs contribute to replication of these DNA tumor viruses may uncover a role for RNA molecules in
facilitating viral persistence as well as identify cellular pathways that may be exploited for the treatment of viral-
and potentially non-viral-associated cancers."
10852905,"Project 4
Project Summary Abstract
The goal of this project is to continue to determine how EBV modulates cell growth with particular focus on the
BART long noncoding RNAs and to identify potential effects of the presence of EBV infected cells on the
growth and expression of HPV infected cells. We have previously shown profound effects of the viral
oncogenes, latent membrane proteins 1 and 2, on the growth of cells through activation of distinct signaling
pathways and effects on protein levels through ubiquitination and determined that these proteins are secreted
in exosomes and can be transferred to uninfected cells. Recently, we have utilized RNASeq to analyze total
cellular expression in the AGS epithelial cell line, with or without EBV infection, grown in vitro and as tumors in
NOD SCID mice in comparison with the C666 NPC cell line, and the NPC xenografts C15 and C17. The
majority of the identified canonical pathways based on two fold changes in expression had decreased activity
in vivo. EBV expression was also distinct with greatly increased transcription of the BART non coding RNAs in
both NPC and the AGS cells. The significant expression of the viral BART nc RNAs in vivo in the absence of
the EBV transforming proteins suggests that they are contributing factors to tumorigenesis. Their effects and
potential mechanisms of action are a major focus of this application.
EBV persistent infection in the oropharynx has several states of infection with cells that express multiple viral
proteins including LMP1 and LMP2, cells that are restricted to BART miRNA and lnc RNA, and cells with some
replicative reactivation. It is likely that through EV shedding, EBV may greatly impact other oropharyngeal viral
infections. Importantly, HPV throat cancer is now the most rapidly increasing virally associated cancer. The
almost universal oral infection with EBV could likely modulate the growth and cellular expression of HPV
infected cells and potentially enhance their oncogenic properties. The in vivo interactions of EBV and HPV
have not yet been defined. This proposal will determine how the distinct latent EBV infections or permissive
infection alter the growth and expression of HPV infected cells."
10852921,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tracheal Intubation (TI) is a common life-saving intervention for resuscitation of critically ill infants in Neonatal
Intensive Care Units (NICUs). Through our NICHD-funded NICU multicenter registry (National Emergency
Airway Registry for Neonates: NEAR4NEOS), we have identified that Adverse TI Associated Events (TIAEs)
occur in 22% TIs, severe TIAES occur in 4% TIs, and multiple attempts occur in 23% TIs. Oxygen
desaturations (captured separately from TIAEs) are frequent and pronounced, with a mean 28% decline in
SpO2 during neonatal TI. Moreover, neonates who experienced adverse TIAEs were at higher risk of
extubation failure and NICU mortality.
We have identified key factors strongly associated with adverse TIAEs: 1) patient risk, 2) provider skill, 3)
premedication with paralysis, and 4) video laryngoscopy. We have developed, refined, and tested a
Personalized Intubation Safety (PINS) Bundle aimed at addressing these factors and prompting a prospective
plan for TI management. The prototype Safety Bundle resulted in a sustained 66% reduction in severe TI
adverse events in our pilot single center study.
In this proposal, we will perform a pragmatic stepped wedge cluster randomized trial across 8 NEAR4NEOS
NICUs to assess the impact of the Personalized Intubation Bundle on TI safety events. The timing of
introducing the Bundle intervention will be randomized at the NICU site level. Our primary outcome is adverse
TIAEs; secondary outcomes are severe TIAEs, multiple (>2) attempts, and magnitude of oxygen desaturation.
We will test whether there is a significant variability in the treatment effect of the PINS Bundle based on the
airway provider skill. This will provide important information about the impact of the Bundle intervention and its
components for novice vs. experienced providers, which will help NICUs to contextualize study findings.
Finally, we will explore the impact of the PINS Bundle intervention on relevant NICU patient outcomes,
including extubation failure, duration of mechanical ventilation, intraventricular hemorrhage, and NICU
mortality.
Upon successful completion of this project, we will establish the effectiveness of a prospective Personalized
Intubation Safety Bundle to reduce adverse events, multiple attempts and oxygen desaturation during neonatal
TI. These results will generate a paradigm shift to improve neonatal intubation procedural safety."
10853972,"Bacterial pathogens continue to pose an urgent threat to public health, adapting rapidly to a changing
landscape of antibiotic use, and claiming millions of lives worldwide each year. The ongoing emergence and
widespread dissemination of new bacterial threats, with increased virulence, antibiotic resistance, and
transmissibility, demand urgent attention on a global scale. There are critical gaps in our understanding of the
adaptive strategies these pathogens deploy to i) evade the host immune system, ii) respond to therapeutic
interventions, and iii) rapidly disseminate locally and globally; thereby, limiting our ability to successfully prevent
and treat bacterial infections. Our long-term goal is to build upon our established track record of technological
and bioinformatic innovation through the development, optimization and application of cutting-edge sequencing
technologies, high-throughput molecular and multi-omic approaches and computational tools to shed new light
on bacterial dynamics and their adaptive strategies. Together with our long-standing collaborations with a
range of multidisciplinary world-renowned experts, and access to large, unique, systematic collections of
pathogens, genomes and clinical data, we are optimally positioned to fill outstanding knowledge gaps for
pressing infectious diseases.
 In this proposal, we will explore the adaptation and spread of high priority bacterial threats across the
following three specific aims: i) We will characterize Neisseria gonorrhoeae’s genetic and transcriptional
adaptation to anatomical sites of infection and host immune pressures. This will be achieved using long-read
sequencing technology paired with an innovative pangenome hybrid selection technique to enrich gonorrhoeal
DNA and RNA directly from patient specimens, providing insights into within-host genomic and transcriptomic
diversity. ii) We will identify cryptic resistance factors in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, where resistance remains unexplained in >20% of cases. For a collection of
clinically collected isolates lacking characterized carbapenem resistance mechanisms, we will perform bulk
RNA-Seq and a novel single-cell bacterial RNA-Seq approach to elucidate differential expression and
transcriptional heterogeneity driving resistance, and functionally test our predictions. iii) We will explore the
epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of plasmids, and their role in disseminating virulence and drug
resistance genes. We will accomplish this by applying novel computational algorithms designed to limit the
need for expensive long-read data to isolate collections spanning different populations and timescales. The
expected outcome of this project is a more complete understanding of the within-host dynamics, adaptation
and spread of bacterial pathogens, which will provide critical evidence for the future development of
prophylaxis, treatment and infection control measures. In addition, this proposal will generate data resources,
tools and protocols of considerable benefit to the research community."
10853973,"Fungal pathogens have an enormous impact on human health; the lack of effective antifungal therapies, the
diversity of species infecting humans, and the emergence of new lineages or species and rising antifungal
resistance represent major challenges to treatment. Clinical isolates display enormous genotypic and
phenotypic variation, yet we lack an understanding of how this variation should impact treatment decisions, as
most studies are performed with laboratory isolates. To interpret variation, we also need to more widely
annotate gene function across the genome. Our long-term goal is to map how pathogen gene content and
variation contributes to infection severity, adaptation, and drug resistance and use this to guide clinical
interventions. This project will use powerful genomic and transcriptomic approaches to examine two species
representing the most severe threats to human health, Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida auris.
In the first aim, we will study the genetic basis of pathogenesis of C. neoformans, a major cause of infection in
immunocompromised individuals, by combining genome-wide association, large-scale phenotyping, and
transcriptional analysis of clinical isolates from two large studies. We will measure survival during pulmonary
infection in mice and will measure virulence attributes of capsule and temperature resistance; these
phenotypes and clinical metadata of infection severity will be utilized for genome-wide association studies. We
will also carry out an analysis of selective constraint to prioritize variants for further analysis. Gene expression
in highly virulent and avirulent isolates will be mapped during pulmonary infection, including profiling
granulomas, and monitoring host transcriptional responses. These analyses will reveal genes associated with
severe disease progression, how variants selected in the population, and will map differences in the host
response for isolates varying in virulence. In the second aim, we will systematically characterize and classify
genes required by the emerging multidrug resistant species Candida auris to respond to antifungal drugs and
to survive in conditions to which it has uniquely adapted including high temperature, high salt, and sweat
media. We will adapt a CRISPRi system for C. auris to enable repression of every gene in the genome and
passage a CRISPRi library to map genes that exhibit growth differences in each condition. In parallel, we will
adapt single-cell RNA-Seq for C. auris and evaluate heterogeneity in the response to antifungal drugs. Finally,
we will passage the CRISPRi library in each condition and perform scRNA-Seq, clustering transcripts from
each perturbation for each condition to develop an atlas of gene expression clusters of C. auris across these
conditions of clinical importance. Our work will provide an unprecedented whole-genome view into these
pathogens, needed to characterize and treat clinical isolates. A synthesis of our findings will guide the
development of new clinical interventions, such as markers of severe clinical strains that could prioritize
treatment decisions and genes that alter antifungal or growth properties that may represent drug targets."
10852869,"Project Summary
Much of our genome is made up of interspersed repeats derived from the activities of mobile genetic elements.
There are subsets of these sequences that become activated in cancers. Our research lab and others have
shown that nearly half of cancers fail to restrain long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1, L1) sequences. L1 is an
active retrotransposon that codes for two proteins, an RNA binding protein (ORF1p) and a protein with
endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities (ORF2p). Paradoxically, though these proteins are
pervasively expressed in many human cancers, they inhibit cell growth in culture. We have exciting new data
from genome-wide knockout screens demonstrating how tumor suppressor gene mutations found in cancers
enable them to survive and grow despite their expression of L1. More importantly, these screens have also
identified genes that become essential in cells coping with L1 expression. These synthetic lethal genes
represent unique molecular vulnerabilities for L1(+) cells. L1(+) cells require specific DNA repair pathways,
effective replication stress signaling pathways, and replication fork restart capabilities. Here, we will test the
hypothesis that these pathways are required to eliminate L1 insertion intermediates and prevent collisions
between these intermediates and DNA replication forks. This project will increase our understanding of how
cancer cells replicate their DNA. It could lay a foundation to leverage L1-associated DNA replication stress to
limit cancer cell growth."
10853100,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Motor impairments arising from neural injuries such as stroke impact millions of people in the United States.
These injuries often result in chronic upper limb disability, which can substantially diminish quality of life. It is
widely held that plasticity in the motor cortex (M1) underlies recovery of function following stroke; therefore, the
development of methods to enhance neuroplasticity promises greater functional recovery in patients. We have
developed a novel strategy to promote synaptic plasticity in motor networks and enhance recovery of motor
function following stroke. This technique uses brief bursts of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) to engage
neuromodulatory circuits during rehabilitative exercises. When paired with motor rehabilitation training, vagus
nerve stimulation (VNS) induces M1 plasticity and significantly improves recovery of forelimb function in
preclinical models of stroke. Moreover, based on a recent successful pivotal trial, VNS therapy has received FDA
approval as the first neuromodulation therapy for recovery of upper limb function in chronic stroke.
While VNS therapy represents a potentially transformative intervention for chronic stroke patients, additional
development is needed to optimize the efficacy of this treatment strategy—to improve both the magnitude of the
therapeutic effect and the number of participants that respond to VNS treatment. Key to the successful
development of more effective approaches is a clear understanding of the mechanisms that give rise to
neuroplasticity that subserves stroke recovery. VNS is thought to work by increasing the activity of
neuromodulators in M1, creating a neocortical state conducive to plasticity. Noradrenaline (norepinephrine, NE),
in particular, is known to play a key role in VNS-dependent neuroplasticity, but whether this important
neuromodulatory system critically contributes to VNS efficacy in the context of stroke recovery remains unknown.
In the current proposal, we aim to critically examine the functional relevance of VNS-dependent engagement of
the noradrenergic network in driving synaptic plasticity and functional recovery after stroke. In Aim I, we use an
optogenetic approach to ask whether VNS-driven activation of broadly-projecting noradrenergic neurons in the
locus coeruleus is necessary and sufficient to enhance corticospinal connectivity and forelimb motor
performance following stroke. In Aim II, we test whether local noradrenergic signaling within the motor cortex is
central to VNS-mediated stroke recovery. And in Aim III, we test whether adjunctive pharmacological
enhancement of central noradrenergic signaling can improve the effectiveness of VNS during stroke
rehabilitation.
By causally examining the importance of NE signaling in VNS-driven corticospinal plasticity and stroke recovery,
the proposed Aims will elucidate the neurobiological underpinnings of VNS-enhanced rehabilitation and inform
the development and validation of more effective treatment options for stroke patients."
10844126,"Project Summary. Lyme disease (LD) is the most common vector-borne illness in the northern hemisphere,
with an estimated 476,000 new cases annually in the US. No effective prevention is currently available. The
disease is caused by infection with Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) which is transmission by Ixodes ticks. After
inoculation in the skin, Bb disseminates to different organs, presumably by evading host immune responses,
including complement- and antibody-mediated killing. While Bb does not cause symptoms in reservoir hosts,
such as Peromyscus mice (white footed mice) and wild birds, it persists in these animals and can thus be
transmitted to humans by tick bite. Our overreaching goal is to identify the mechanisms that facilitate
persistence of Bb in natural reservoir hosts, which can ultimately facilitate the understanding of bird-specific
responses to carry avian-transmitted pathogens, informing the public health intervention against those
pathogens. Our recent field findings demonstrate that wild birds frequently carry certain Bb ospC genotypes
(e.g., ospC-E, -I, -N) which are rarely found in Peromyscus. In contrast, birds less often carry genotypes (e.g.,
ospC-K) which are common in Peromyscus. This is consistent with our laboratory findings in Peromyscus, or
American robins as a model avian reservoir: ospC-E-infected robins transmitted Bb to fed larvae more efficiently
than ospC-E-infected Peromyscus, whereas the opposite was true for ospC-K. These findings highlight the role
of birds as a reservoir for Bb strains that are rarely carried by Peromyscus. In addition, they validate robins as
a model of avian reservoir host which allows us to recapitulate the field findings in a controlled laboratory
environment. Using this model, we found that during early infection, robins induced robust inflammatory (e.g.,
IFNγ, TNF) and antibody responses to less competent bird genotypes (ospC-K), but only minimal responses
to bird-adapted genotypes (ospC-E). Interestingly, antibody responses to ospC-E or ospC-K were
indistinguishable late in the infection. Additionally, ospC-E strain escaped robin complement-mediated killing
more efficiently than ospC-K strain. Thus, these heightened immune responses were associated with Bb
clearance, implying that modulation of early host immune responses may facilitate the persistence of certain
Bb genotypes in birds. In this proposal we are testing the hypothesis that wild birds maintain certain Bb
genotypes by modulating early immune responses in a strain-specific manner. We thus will 1) Ascertain the
role of complement on survival and persistence of bird-adapted Bb strains in birds. 2) Determine the impact of
delayed antibody response on survival of bird-adapted Bb strains in birds. 3) Investigate the role of immune
tolerance on survival and persistence of bird-adapted Bb strains in birds. This study will define a new paradigm
in pathogen maintenance in animal reservoir hosts, identifying the immune mechanisms that allow wild birds
to serve as a unique reservoir of human-relevant Bb. Such knowledge will ultimately inform intervention for the
transmission of Bb and other bird-transmitted pathogens and reducing human exposure to those pathogens."

This T35 application requests funding for the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine (CWRU
SOM) Medical Student Summer Research Program in Aging and Alzheimer’s Disease (MSSRPA). The overall
goal of the program is to promote career development for physician scientists who will include biomedical
investigation as a career goal, with particular focus on Alzheimer’s disease, aging, and related research. The
program will educate medical students using a mentor-based research approach over a 12-week training period
between their 1st and 2nd years of medical school. Program mentors are based at the CWRU SOM and all four
affiliated hospitals: University Hospitals, the Cleveland Clinic, MetroHealth, and the Louis Stokes VA Medical
Center. The 19 mentors have a track record of collaboration manifest by joint publications, MPI grants, co-
investigatorships on grants, and participation in a funded Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center or the CDC-
supported Center for Prion Surveillance, and garner more than $14 million annually in external direct research
support, an average of $738,000 per investigator. They represent a wide range of ranks, backgrounds, and
research expertise from molecular to community-based research. Our mentors have strong training records and
there is formal institutional instruction in mentoring. The Case MSSRPA will draw from a highly qualified, diverse
pool of medical students through a formal application and evaluation process that identifies a research project
and mentor from investigators working in a research area related to Alzheimer’s disease and aging. Special
efforts will be made to enroll students from underrepresented groups in Classes A, B, and C. Program evaluation
and student progress is overseen by the T35 Executive and Internal Advisory Committees. When the summer
research is completed, students submit a written abstract and present their findings during Lepow Medical
Student Research Day. Though the centerpiece of the program is the mentored research experience, we include
an innovative curriculum that features weekly group meetings with the director and others, didactic lectures, and
a three-day hands-on course held at the start of the 12-week research period, as well as instruction in the
responsible conduct of research, rigor and reproducibility. Much of this curriculum will be shared with another
highly successful funded T35 from NIDDK. Programmatic evaluation will use direct feedback and end-of-program
surveys of students and mentors, with appropriate response from the Executive Committee. To assess the long-
term impact of the program, we will collaborate with the Medical Education and Alumni Affairs offices to track
medical students for 20 years after graduation. Our mentors currently train over 25 medical students in their labs,
CWRU SOM requires an original research thesis for graduation, and there are more than 175 eligible students
in each class, so we are confident that we can support training of the proposed 10 students per year in the
MSSRPA. The academic environment is ideal to sustain the overall objectives of this short-term training program."
10846632,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Early life adversity (ELA), such as physical or sexual abuse, witnessing a crime, family conflict, or community
violence, can have prolonged effects and significantly increases the risk for later psychopathology.
Experiencing such adversity can result in a wide range of psychiatric disorders, which have been found to be
more resistant to treatment. Further complicating intervention efforts, some youth exposed to ELA continue to
show normal functioning and behavior over time (“adaptive” or “resilient”), while others show increasing
psychiatric symptoms and go on to develop psychiatric disorders (“vulnerable”). The factors and
neurobiological mechanisms that underlie this variability and that prospectively identify those at greatest risk
are not yet well understood. This is a critical knowledge gap in the ability to help youth who have experienced
early life adversity. Recent research suggests that youth with ELA have abnormal function and connectivity
within and between 3 core brain networks which support emotional reactivity and cognitive-emotional control -
the salience network (SN), frontoparietal network (FPN), and default mode network (DMN), and changes in
these networks are associated with a wide range of psychopathology. To date, however, no study has
systematically examined the relative developmental trajectories of these core networks, how they are altered
by ELA exposure, and how such alterations relate to the expression of general psychopathology risk and
unique dimensions of internalizing vs. externalizing. The proposed study addresses these gaps of knowledge
by examining the association between ELA, FPN, DMN, and SN network development, and both overall
psychopathological load as well as specific dimensions of psychopathology using data from a large cohort
(n=11,873) of adolescents from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Demographic,
environmental, and behavioral data are acquired every year and neuroimaging data are acquired every 2
years, starting at age 9-10y. This is a critical developmental period, the entrance into puberty, characterized by
both a rapid emergence of psychiatric disorders as well as sex differences in the prevalence of internalizing
and externalizing disorders. The function and interaction of SN, FPN, and DMN are examined both at rest and

Data are analyzed using both model-based and data-driven methods. Finally, this research uses both model-
based prediction and machine learning to determine potential early predictors of later psychopathology."

The Biopathology Center (BPC), part of the Abigail Wexner Research Institute of Nationwide Children’s
Hospital, houses the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN) Biospecimen Bank (Biobank).
In this project, the ETCTN Biobank will expand to include other National Cancer Institute (NCI)-supported
early-phase and experimental trial networks and investigators and be known as the Early-Phase and
Experimental Clinical Trials (EET) Biobank. The NCI supports a clinical trials infrastructure to facilitate the early
stages of development and evaluation of anti-cancer therapeutic agents. The EET Biobank will promote a
collection of standardized biospecimens by procuring, processing, banking, and distributing high-quality human
biospecimens from cancer patients who participate in NCI Phases 0, I, and II trials and other experimental
therapeutic cancer trials.
EET clinical trials will include a range of cancer types (i.e., breast, lung, colon, prostate, leukemia, melanoma,
lymphoma, and multiple myeloma). These biospecimens will be linked to detailed biospecimen-related data
(including information on surgical, pathological, and radiological reports), as well as comprehensive clinical
data, including detailed drug information, treatment histories/outcomes, and cancer recurrence data. The EET
Biobank will work closely with study teams and investigators to ensure that biospecimens are handled
appropriately for planned and future research. In these efforts, the EET Biobank will continue to support the
processing, banking, and distribution of biospecimens to the Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Centers
(CIMACs). Biospecimens will first be distributed to investigators for planned research designed to meet the
objectives included in the clinical trial. After the objectives in the clinical trial are met, the EET Biobank will then
distribute biospecimens to qualified investigators for projects approved by the Cancer Therapy Evaluation
Program (CTEP).
The EET Biobank seeks to promote outstanding research through the banking of high-quality, clinically
annotated, cancer-related human biospecimens. To support this effort, the EET Biobank will manage these
biospecimens under strict guidelines and standard operating procedures based on current best practices for
biorepositories, current regulatory guidelines, and the latest laboratory technologies. The EET Biobank will
benefit from the BPC’s experience in supporting biobanking efforts for several NCI-funded groups, including
the NCTN (Children’s Oncology Group [COG], SWOG [formerly the Southwest Oncology Group], NRG
Oncology) and the ETCTN. Coupled with a firm commitment to quality and to the integrity of its operations, the
EET Biobank will be uniquely able to provide an accurate and effective resource of high-quality tumor and
normal samples with associated clinical and epidemiologic information."
10846634,"SUMMARY
Pluripotency is a critical model for understanding fundamental principles of cell fate specification. This process
makes selective use of enhancers, regulatory elements that facilitate the transcription of cell-type specific
genes. Although changes in enhancer activity are predicted to have broad developmental and pathological
implications, we currently have limited understanding of how enhancers regulate development and disease, in
part due to our incomplete understanding of the mechanisms by which enhancers regulate gene expression.
Increased understanding of the molecular events that regulate enhancer activity, particularly under
developmental contexts, will provide important insights into congenital diseases that occur with their
dysregulation. The chromatin state at enhancers is characterized by the presence of the histone variant, H3.3,
and recruitment of the CBP/p300 family of transcriptional coactivators. Our recent studies demonstrate that
H3.3 deposition at enhancers allows for variant-specific phosphorylation that stimulates p300 acetyltransferase
activity towards its substrate histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27ac) in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Further,
we find that CBP and p300 carry out distinct functions in ESCs, with p300 playing a greater role in maintaining
H3K27ac in ESCs. Finally, we find that reduced H3K27ac due to H3.3 or p300 deletion is well tolerated in
ESCs, with little correlated change in transcription. However, both H3.3 and p300 are required for
differentiation, suggesting that H3.3 deposition and subsequent high levels of H3K27ac may be more important
for activating gene transcription than for maintaining ongoing transcription in ESCs. The objective of this
proposal is to dissect the molecular and functional mechanisms by which enhancers are activated both in
pluripotency and differentiation. In the first aim, we will determine how H3.3 phosphorylation stimulates p300
activity in ESCs. In the second aim, we will determine why H3K27 acetyltransferase activity is restricted to
p300 in ESCs. Finally, in the third aim, we will use the tools of chemical biology and novel mouse models that
we have generated to ask how H3.3 and p300 function to promote transcription during pre-implantation
development. Collectively, our work will explore molecular links between H3.3 and p300 in enhancer activation
during the time at which the first lineage specification events occur, with important implications for
understanding how enhancer dysregulation contributes to human disease."
10847989,"PROJECT 2: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Activated B cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL) and Epstein Barr virus associated viral
lymphomas (EBV+ lymphoma) have in common that they are among the most aggressive and difficult to treat
lymphomas and both hijack potent signaling cascades to drive aggressive growth, survival, and resistance to
treatment. These hijacked signaling programs flip a potent epigenetic switch that results in activation of positive-
selection and differentiation programs that are characteristic of aged autoimmune B cells (AAB) (P3). This
chromatin program involves loss of PRC2/H3K27me3 and stimulation of CREBBP (P4), KMT2D (P1) and is
highly active at ABC-DLBCL and EBV+ lymphoma signature genes. The mechanisms by which immune synapse
signaling, viral oncogenes, or ABC-DLBCL mutations activate these epigenetic programs have not been
characterized. Our preliminary data show that histone H3 phosphorylation (H3ph) at both residue S28 (H3S28ph)
and residue 31 (H3.3S31ph), downstream of immune synapse signaling, can potently disrupt and reshape
chromatin states, acting as a sensitive signaling scaffold. Normally absent in resting B cells, we find constitutive
high-level H3ph at lymphoma signature genes in ABC-DLBCL and EBV+ lymphoma. Further, in human
lymphomas we found that H3S28ph high tumors are associated with decreased survival and that both ABC-
DLBCL and EBV+ lymphoma cells are selectively sensitive to histone kinase inhibition. Based on these
preliminary data, we hypothesize that ABC-DLBCL signaling mutations and EBV oncoproteins signal through
histone kinases and H3ph to constitutively switch on chromatin at lymphoma driver genes. To pursue this
hypothesis we will first use mechanistic, biochemical, and epigenetic studies of murine and human models of
ABC-DLBCL and EBV+ lymphoma to determine the sequence of epigenetic events that activate gene expression
downstream from Myd88 and Cd79b mutations or EBV oncoproteins, respectively, expecting that H3ph is an
initiating and dominant epigenetic event (Aim 1). Next, we will determine the direct contribution of H3ph to
malignant transformation of GC B cells by employing first-of-their-kind histone functional mutagenesis
approaches that confer constitutive activation or suppression of H3ph in mouse and human lymphoma (Aim 2).
Finally, we will determine whether chromatin kinases and histone phosphorylation are required for maintenance
of ABC-DLBCL and viral lymphomas using small-molecule inhibitors and inducible knock-down of MSK and
IKKa, and CRISPR editing of histone genes in well-characterized models of ABC-DLBCL and EBV+ lymphoma.
We expect to find that ABC-DLBCL and EBV+ lymphoma require histone kinases and H3ph for
lymphomagenesis and are addicted to their constitutive activity for maintenance. We anticipate that these studies
will establish histone kinases as novel dependencies for these aggressive lymphomas for which there are
currently few treatment options."

This application is a competitive renewal of 5T32 MH18951-32, a clinical/translational research training program
in child mental health (MH). Support is requested annually for 6 post-doctoral trainees (child psychiatrists and
doctorates in other disciplines) and 4 medical students for summer research electives. This 2-3 year postdoctoral
training program builds on previous success recruiting and training a diverse group of scientists who formulate
impactful research to improve child MH. The program targets current priorities in child MH research: improving
understanding of pathogenesis, course and treatment of child MH disorders; enhancing health equity; utilizing
technological advances; and community-partnered research. An accomplished multi-disciplinary Training
Faculty provides mentorship. Each trainee selects an academically successful mentor and 2 co-mentors who
together develop a career development plan with targeted goals for skill acquisition, presentations, publications,
pilot data, and grant proposal preparation. The mentors, trainee, Program Director and selected Training
Executive Committee (TEC) members review the plan every 6 months to ensure progress. An individually tailored
course of didactic study is developed for each trainee to ensure acquisition of knowledge in Core Content (e.g.,
research design, statistics). Trainees also participate in “Career and Research Development” seminars on grant
writing, project management, and training on responsible conduct of research. Monthly T32 seminars facilitated
by junior faculty further foster community among trainees and a forum for open dialogue around professional
development topics. Since the last renewal, we have further strengthened program leadership by expanding the
TEC; enhanced depth and breadth among our Training Faculty; offer monthly journal clubs led by Training
Faculty in Core Content Areas; and added an expert External Advisory Board. We now offer coursework in 3
Cross-Cutting Areas critical to the conduct of impactful clinical science in child MH: Health Equity, Technological
Advances, and Community-Based Research. There is high institutional commitment to this T32, with
Departmental salary and benefit supplementation, formal grant review processes for trainees, and extensive
CTSI resources to support project development and management. Of 27 T32 postdoctoral trainees since 2013,
70% attained faculty appointments and 70% received external funding (including 10 K-awards); 33% identify as
under-represented minorities. In the summer research program aiming to stimulate interest in child psychiatry
research, medical students work on a research project with a Training Faculty mentor. Of 40 predoctoral trainees
since 2013 (18% under-represented minorities), 78% entered a child-related residency and 88% published at

This proposal is a request for a 3 Tesla, whole-body, wide-bore magnetic resonance imaging system for the
University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus School of Medicine. The proposed instrument, a 3T GE
SIGNA Premier XT, would fulfill unmet research needs while providing greater scientific and funding
opportunities for investigators across a wide range of departments and institutions. Major research interests of
our investigators include understanding the neurobiology of obesity and food intake behaviors, substance use
disorders, psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, and fetal exposures to stress or environmental
factors, as well as non-neuronal mechanisms of metabolic disorders and kidney function. In the context of our
expanding research enterprise, our current scanner is oversubscribed, leading to a need for additional
scanning capacity. Additionally, the increased capabilities of the proposed scanner, which include substantially
improved gradient performance compared to our current Siemens 3T MRI scanner, would be highly beneficial,
as it would allow improved image quality (higher signal-to-noise, reduced distortion and artifacts in many types
of scans) and enable performance levels compatible with current standards of large-scale neuroimaging
consortiums. Importantly, this improved gradient performance can be achieved in a wide-bore system, a
feature that remains critical for our investigators, given the large number of studies focused on obesity and
related disorders. The requested scanner is also quieter, with reduced vibrations. This would benefit all
studies, as it improves participant comfort and compliance. This is especially useful for studies focused on
psychiatric disorders, in which our investigators often assess auditory processing, which is limited by the loud
noise generated by our current scanner. Quieter scanning would also benefit research investigating
neurodevelopment in infants, who have to be able to sleep during scanning. Higher acceleration factors on the
new scanner would allow for shorter overall exam times, additionally increasing the likelihood of scan
completion in infant and pediatric populations. These factors would also result in less geometric distortion and
signal dropout in many of the brain regions studied by our investigators. Multiple other benefits of the proposed
system, including enhanced overall homogeneity, more receiver coils, better analog-to-digital converters,
improved reconstruction, including the capability to run Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence-based
reconstruction, improved processing speed, and the availability of AIRTM coils will also yield myriad
improvements in data quality, participant comfort, and compliance. These upgrades will improve our
investigators’ ability to innovate, collaborate, and make important contributions to science."
10854900,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Frailty is a syndromic state of vulnerability that puts adults aged ≥65 years at heightened risk of adverse health
outcomes. An estimated 50% of older Americans are prefrail—a pre-clinical stage of frailty that might be more
amenable to intervention efforts than frailty. Increasing physical activity is a promising intervention to better
manage/help reverse the multisystem dysregulation that drives frailty and sequalae. However, initiating and
maintaining habitual physical activity is difficult for sedentary older adults, particularly those encumbered by
health challenges. The 2018 US Physical Activity Guidelines recommends that all adults perform ≥150
minutes/week of physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviors. Yet, traditional approaches to increase
physical activity do little to address sedentary behavior reduction, especially for older adults. Lower sedentary
behavior is associated with improved biological and psychosocial health—independent of meeting physical
activity guidelines. Thus, there remains a critical need to implement and evaluate a structured way to reduce
sedentary behavior as a potential pathway for habitual physical activity engagement. Using novel objectively
measured physical activity metrics, our research group has shown that daily sedentary time, either in total or
accrued in a prolonged manner, is associated with frailty. Our observation evidence shows that: 1) daily, non-
exercise physical activity declines and becomes more fragmented with age (less continuous activity with longer
sedentary bouts), 2) higher daily sedentary time and activity fragmentation are both associated with higher
frailty incidence, and 3) sedentary time is positively associated with frailty-related markers of inflammation. We
propose a pilot study in which we randomize 60 prefrail community-dwelling older adults to receive one of two
interventions, each designed to gradually reduce sedentary time: 1) continuously to form a 30-minute walking
bout, or 2) in a bouted manner to form three 10-minute walking bouts. Project goals are to: a) explore the
effectiveness within and between interventions to decrease objectively measured sedentary time over 2
months; b) assess decreased sedentary time’s association with i) patient-reported outcomes and ii) frailty-
related inflammatory markers. The primary outcome is accelerometer-determined sedentary time. Secondary
outcomes include activity fragmentation, patient-reported outcomes, and inflammatory markers. With a
transdisciplinary mentoring panel, my career development plan builds on my expertise in aging and physical
activity epidemiology to gain proficiency in: 1) developing and implementing clinical trials for older adults, 2)
designing interventions to improve health behaviors, 3) conducting frailty and inflammation related research
and 4) gaining competencies to become an effective PI and leader. This project utilizes the infrastructure of the
Johns Hopkins Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) and Beacham Center for Geriatric
Medicine which have strong records of supporting early-stage faculty. This award will facilitate my transition to
an independent investigator and will also provide informative data for R21 and R01 applications."
10852493,"Project Abstract
Current treatments of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) have shown moderate success in reducing heavy alcohol
drinking but are marred with the problem of treatment adherence. In the clinic, opiate receptor pharmaceutics
are often combined with cognitive behavioral therapies to improve long-term abstinence. These findings suggest
an important relation between endogenous opioid signaling and cognitive factors in the treatment of AUD;
however, lapses in treatment can quickly reinstate alcohol drinking, highlighting a knowledge gap in our
understanding of how these mechanisms may influence long-term misuse. In this regard, alcohol consumption
stimulates the release of endogenous opioids, including enkephalins that bind to mu-type opioid receptors (MOR)
commonly found in limbic areas of the brain. The manipulation of MOR signaling alters the rewarding properties
of alcohol, with agonists facilitating reward and consumption, and antagonists blocking these responses. The
shared relation between opioidergic responses that underlie motivation and cognition are not well understood
but present a focal point for addressing complex pathologies that may underlie alcohol-related sensitivities. In
this regard, MORs are found in frontal cortical regions that modulate cognitive function, such as the medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Preclinical studies in our laboratory demonstrate that alcohol dependence in rats
decreases the phosphorylation of MOR in the mPFC, and increases expression of the neuropeptide precursor,
proenkephalin (PENK). This pattern of changes overlaps with clinical observations of MOR desensitization in
AUD patients. The findings suggest that dependence may dysregulate opioidergic signaling in the mPFC,
although the extent to which such conditions surmise changes in the endogenous ligands is unclear. A better
understanding is warranted given that adherence to opiate antagonists diminishes over protracted abstinence
and may be undermined by molecular intermediates in the processing of small-opioid peptides. Here, we will
explore the central hypothesis that non-canonical PENK signaling in the mPFC plays a pivotal role in
dysregulating cognitive function during abstinence. Towards this goal, discovery-based and quantitative mass
spectrometry approaches will be combined with in vivo microdialysis to broadly capture PENK-mediated
signaling in alcohol-dependent rats undergoing abstinence (Aim 1). We will then explore the functional relevance
of non-canonical PENK signaling in relation to hyperexcitable states of withdrawal (Aim 2) and induced-deficits
in cognitive flexibility (Aim 3). The results are expected to provide insight into druggable targets that extend
beyond conventional opioidergic signaling processes and will establish a framework for mechanisms of cortical
excitability that may be influential in AUD pathology and cognitive behavior."
10852272,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The mTOR pathway is a master regulator of nutrient metabolism and cell proliferation in response to
environmental cues. It has long been viewed as an important driver of tumorigenesis and an ideal cancer
therapeutic target. Multiple mTOR inhibitors have been tested in more than 500 clinical trials, either as
single agents or in combination with chemotherapy for cancer treatment. However, among nearly 200
completed trials, few show positive outcomes, challenging the utility of mTOR as an effective cancer
therapeutic target. As an integrator of extracellular signals and cellular responses, the mTOR pathway is
critical for cellular adaptation to environmental changes. In particular, mTOR inhibition induces embryonic
diapause, a reversible dormancy state in development in response to unfavorable environment cues. We
reason that, analogous to its role in embryonic diapause, mTOR inhibition may induce an adaptive
diapause-like dormant state in cancers, leading to the persistence of residual tumors following
chemotherapy. In line with this notion, recent studies have indeed reported markedly reduced mTOR activity
in residual tumors. However, a causal relationship between mTOR inhibition and tumor persistence has not
been established or investigated. Integrating multiple state-of-the-art approaches, our recent studies show
that mTOR inhibition indeed induces a diapause-like persister state in tumor cells. We confirm that this is a
pan-cancer phenomenon using tumors from diverse tissue origins and demonstrate that the persister state
recapitulates the residual tumors in patients following chemotherapy. Importantly, our studies identify
ferroptosis as a key druggable vulnerability of persisters. Built on these compelling findings, we
hypothesize that mTOR is a master regulator of a diapause-like persister state in tumors by modulating
survival and dormancy. The current proposal aims to investigate the mechanistic regulation of the persister
state, and test therapeutic strategies to target residual tumors in preclinical models, with the ultimate goal
to prevent tumor recurrence in patients."
10851455,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We aim to evaluate a novel approach for effective treatment of nitrogen mustard (NM)-induced corneal injury in
rat and rabbit models. NM is a bi-functional analogue of sulphur mustard (SM). Ocular exposure of NM causes
a range of complications including corneal ulceration, corneal opacity, chronic inflammation, corneal
neovascularization, and even blindness. Therapeutic interventions to treat vesicants induced ocular injury has
not been identified yet, which highlights the need to identify effective treatment options for vesicants-induced
corneal injury. Dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DSP) eye drop is FDA approved drug for the treatment of
ocular inflammation associated with various agents. Studies have reported beneficial effects of dexamethasone
eye drops in vesicants-induced corneal injury in the rabbits. However, due to the rapid tear turnover and
clearance of instilled drops and poor ocular bioavailability, frequent administration is necessary which results in
poor patient compliance. To address these problems, we developed biodegradable nanoparticles of DSP with
poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) or poly(lactic acid) (PLA), that can be administered by subconjunctival (SCT)
injection after NM exposure and provide sustained release of DSP, improving patient’s compliance and
increasing therapeutic efficacy. We hypothesize that long-lasting PLA-DSP-NP (3 months in vitro drug release)
could be effective in preventing corneal ulceration, corneal NV, corneal opacity, suppressing inflammatory and
angiogenic biomarkers in both immediate (0 h post NM exposure) and delayed treatment (24 h post NM
exposure). In Aim 1, we plan to investigate the dose-dependent efficacy of PLA-DSP-NP dosed at both 0 h and
24 h post NM exposure in the corneal injury rat model. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the efficacy of PLA-DSP-NP at
a selected dose after immediate (0 h post NM exposure) and delayed treatment (24 h post NM exposure) in a
more translational NM-induced corneal injury rabbit model."

10840928,"The goals of this proposal are to adapt and test a negotiation and dispute resolutions (NDR) training
program for caregivers of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), who experience conflicts when they
act as patient advocates in the health system [Stage 1A and 1B]. Teaching NDR to family caregivers has
the potential to improve caregiver communication, wellbeing, mood, and the care of the adult with
AD. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects more than 5 million older adults nationally, with the prevalence expected
to increase as our population ages. An integral driver in the care of older adults with AD is the family caregiver.
Our prior research has shown that family caregivers act as patient navigators for their loves ones with AD, often
interacting with the health system for a multitude of conflicts (e.g. determining if a test/medication/hospitalization
is necessary, responding to insurance denials, billing errors). A reoccurring theme is that family caregivers
experience frustration, anxiety, and stress as they deal with these health system conflicts. Whether it is spending
hours on the phone trying to get answers from a health care provider’s team or navigating complex insurance
hoops, these conflicts contribute to the burden experienced by a family caregiver. Unfortunately, family
caregivers are vastly underprepared to effectively negotiate through these conflicts. Northwestern University’s
Kellogg School of Business is an innovator in the field of negotiations and dispute resolution training. Previously,
we have tailored the negotiations training for health professionals with positive results. We hypothesize that
teaching negotiation and dispute resolution tactics to family caregivers of patients with AD will help improve
communication, caregiver stress, anxiety, and empowerment. To test this hypothesis, we aim to: Aim 1: Employ
a caregiver (user)-centered design approach to modify and tailor a negotiations and dispute resolution (NDR)
training intervention to support communication skills of family caregivers of adults with AD. Aim 2: Utilizing
Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST), conduct a randomized pilot trial of the NDR intervention that targets
better communication between caregivers and health teams, using a 2X3 full factorial design, to (2a) determine
the feasibility of delivering the intervention, and (2b) derive estimates of the effect of 3 intervention components
on changes in patient-centered outcomes at post-intervention and follow-up to inform a future RCT trial.
Exploratory Aim 3: Explore if intervention components (lectures/exercises) interact to change communication
between caregivers and health care teams at post-intervention and follow-up. The factorial design will enable
testing if the effect of a component is moderated by another component, to ensure the optimized intervention
retains components that directly or indirectly impact outcomes. We have partnered with community-based family
caregivers who will provide feedback for tailoring the NDR and assist with recruiting family caregivers for the
study. Our goal is to improve communication of family caregivers of adults with AD with healthcare providers and
others through the negotiation and dispute resolution training."
10840936,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The global population is aging rapidly – the number of adults over 65 is expected to double by 2050.
Chronological aging is an established risk factor for neurodegeneration and leads to dysfunction and loss of the
motor unit (MU; a motor neuron and all the myofibers it innervates). Further, genetic variants may accelerate
biological aging and acquired cellular damage in the nervous system. However, aged mammalian tissues retain
an epigenetic signature, and recent publications highlight strategies such as cellular reprogramming to restore
youthful tissue resilience. My long-term career goal is to obtain a tenure-track clinician-scientist position at an
academic institution and establish a translational research program. Such a position will allow me to achieve my
long-term scientific goal to investigate cellular aging of the nervous system in the setting of genetic predisposition.
My short-term scientific goal and the foundation of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that targeting biological
aging pathways independently and in conjunction with disease-specific gene therapies may provide a promising
avenue to develop new therapeutic strategies targeting neurodegeneration. My doctoral project investigates
Kinesin-1 Family Member 5A (KIF5A), a known susceptibility gene for the neurodegenerative disease
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Mutant Kif5a mice demonstrate loss of functional MUs in the context of injury
and aging, with observable pathological correlates. These data support a prominent role of KIF5A in MU
maintenance, suggesting mutant KIF5A is unable to combat biological challenges such as injury or age. The F99
phase of this award will test the hypothesis that ALS-associated Kif5a mutations lead to haploinsufficiency and
use viral vectors to manipulate Kif5a expression. The K00 phase will build upon my experience with MU
physiology, pathology and viral vectors to study aging and neurodegeneration more broadly. As a postdoc, I will
study the interdependence between physiological triggers of disease (genome and exposome), biological aging,
and phenotype. Specifically, the proposed work will investigate AAV-mediated cellular reprogramming of
transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 to improve MU longevity, resilience and repair, and then apply this
approach to genetic MU disease. Aim 2A will test the effect of induced, transient reprogramming of individual
MU cell types on functional, epigenetic, transcriptomic, and histopathological outcomes. Aim 2B will investigate
the value of cellular reprogramming in enhancing aged MU repair and resilience when faced with MU insults.
Aim 2C will test the utility of multi-transgene delivery of longevity-promoting cellular reprogramming
independently and in conjunction with existing gene therapies to have a synergistic effect on disease phenotype.
These studies will provide critical information about mechanisms of MU longevity, resilience and repair and will
test a therapeutic approach that has implications for all age-related neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, the
proposed career development plan was thoughtfully designed to develop the technical expertise, science
communication skills, and mentorship experience essential to becoming an independent investigator."
10843050,"Abstract
Personalized targeted cancer therapy, while initially effective, leads to resistance and disease progression in
>50% of patients in as rapidly as few months after initiating therapy. These therapies directly inhibit the
catalytic and/or ligand-induced functions of the cancer driver, leading to resistance via mutational escape or
epigenetic/transcriptional bypass. To address mutational escape, recent therapeutic approaches leverage
Chemically induced Proximity (CiP): bifunctional molecules that recruit two proteins into proximity for an
emergent therapeutic effect. However, current CiP-based therapies are limited to degradation, which suffers
from similar feedback mechanisms of resistance as direct inhibition of the cancer driver. Then, we recognized
that 45% of all cancer genes are direct transcriptional regulators. Therefore, this proposal outlines a novel CiP-
enabled therapeutic paradigm to hijack cancer drivers to amplify a therapeutic transcriptional program to
directly kill cancer cells.
Specifically, the goal of this proposal is to hijack the estrogen receptor in breast cancer to drive overexpression
of pro-apoptotic factors to induce cancer cell death. First, I will systematically define the most potent pro-
apoptotic factors for transcriptional upregulation induced cell death across multiple estrogen receptor positive
breast cancer cell lines. Second, I will identify and validate transcription factors that regulate these pro-
apoptotic factors by integrating bioinformatic analysis with a high throughput transactivator inducible
recruitment screen. Finally, I will demonstrate that estrogen receptor in breast cancer can be hijacked for
targeted transcriptional upregulation by recruiting it to an endogenously tagged transcription factor regulator of
potent pro-apoptotic factors and to a targeted dCas9. Together, I will identify and demonstrate that estrogen
receptor can be inducibly recruited by CiP to a transcription factor regulator of pro-apoptotic factors to induce
breast cancer cell death.
The successful completion of the aims described will establish not only a novel therapeutic approach for
estrogen receptor positive breast cancer but also a generalizable therapeutic paradigm across multiple cancer
types with transactivating cancer drivers. Furthermore, I will identify robust candidates for subsequent
therapeutic heterobifunctional molecule development. The proposal presented also reflects my training goals of
becoming an interdisciplinary physician-scientist bridging chemical biology tools and epigenetic gene
regulation to address critical problems and needs in cancer biology and therapy."
10843056,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  (ABSTRACT) Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, lupus) is characterized by the generation of autoantibodies that promote tissue injury. Follicular B helper T (Tfh) cells, phenotypically and functionally distinct from other T-helper (Th) cell subsets, reside in B-cell follicles and germinal centers (GCs) of secondary lymphoid organs, where they are essential for B-cell proliferation and survival, immunoglobulin (Ig) affinity selection, and development of memory B and long-lived plasma cells. The regulation of Tfh cells, and how in turn these cells promote autoreactive B cell responses, are critical to understanding the generation of pathogenic autoantibodies in SLE, and ultimately, to determining therapeutic intervention. Tfh cells, and the GC B cells they help, persist in lupus with induction of autoreactive memory B cells and autoantibody-producing plasma cells, by contrast to their appropriate waning following immunization or acute infection. The chronicity of autoreactive Tfh- and B-cell responses in lupus, integral to the disease phenotype, is not well understood. To address this phenomenon, we chronologically analyzed the phenotype and transcriptional profiles of Tfh cells in lupus. Tfh-cell cytokine production was aberrantly regulatd in murine lupus, with persistent co-production of the canonical Tfh-cell cytokine IL-21, alongside interferon-γ (IFN-γ). We also found simultaneous IL-21 and IFN-γ double-producing Tfh cells in in the kidneys of lupus-prone mice, and in the blood of SLE patients. Among the transcriptional changes we observed in lupus Tfh cells was development of a gene signature associated with signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 4, a risk allele strongly associated with the development of SLE that correlated with the maintenance and persistence of the aberrant cytokine producing Tfh cells. By contrast to immunization or acute infection in which Th-cell cytokine production resolves physiologically, in human and murine lupus it persists pathologically, with STAT4 signaling critical for maintenance. We hypothesize that the inflammatory milieu of lupus leads to STAT4-mediated transcriptional changes in Tfh cells causing them to acquire an aberrant pattern of cytokine production, which then promotes pathologic B-cell maturation with autoantibody production. Our plan in this competitive renewal application is to investigate this hypothesis, addressing how the evolving, aberrant Tfh-cell phenotype promotes autoreactive B cell maturation; assessing STAT4-mediated genomic regulation of Tfh cells in lupus; and examining the factors that promote STAT4 signaling in an effort to determine the drivers of the aberrant Tfh-cell phenotype in lupus. We will answer these questions using murine model systems, and to the extent possible, in parallel with experiments using cells from patients with SLE."

Throughout biology, RNA molecules form complex and dynamic networks of molecular interactions that are
essential to their function, but which remain challenging to investigate. These networks of RNA-interacting
proteins, RNAs, and genomic loci regulate nearly all aspects of mRNA function, enable noncoding RNAs that
regulate gene expression at various levels, and scaffold molecular assemblies that control cellular gene-
expression, metabolic, and stress-response programs. Dysregulation of RNA-interactions has been causally
implicated in numerous human pathologies, suggesting that these interactions may represent a significant
class of untapped therapeutic targets. Yet, despite the central importance of RNA to basic biology and human
disease, methods for elucidating the factors that interact with any given RNA remain limited. Current state-of-
the-art approaches—which use biotinylated antisense oligonucleotides to pull down target RNAs from crude
cell lysates—are noisy, suffer from low target RNA specificity, and lack biological context. Emerging strategies
that use transgenically expressed enzymes to affinity-tag RNA-interactors in situ require complicated cell-line
engineering that limits their applicability across cell types and target RNAs. Therefore, there is a pressing need
for straightforward and generalizable tools that can elucidate intra-cellular RNA-interactions at high resolution,
without cumbersome biochemical fractionation or cell-line engineering. To meet this challenge, and in
response to RFA PAR 19-253, this proposal will develop Oligonucleotide-Directed Biotinylation (ODB). This
novel technique combines high-resolution single-molecule RNA-FISH and in situ proximity-biotinylation to map
RNA interaction networks within their native cellular context. In pilot experiments, ODB exhibited exceptionally
precise targeting of individual RNAs in situ, and enabled proteomic analysis of RNA-scaffolded structures that
are difficult to isolate biochemically. We have also recently demonstrated that proximity-biotinylation
approaches like ODB can be used to probe nucleic acids as well as proteins. Given these promising proof-of-
principle results, we propose developing ODB into a unified, “multi-‘omic” method for identifying the proteins,
RNAs, and/or genomic loci that interact with a broad range of target RNAs. In Aim 1, we will optimize the core
steps of the ODB workflow, developing robust protocols for deploying ODB to a target RNA at high spatial
precision, and for isolating RNA-interacting proteins, RNAs, and genomic loci from an ODB experiment. We will
develop general-use strategies for applying ODB in an array of different mammalian cell lines and RNA targets.
In Aim 2, we will “field test” ODB on a dynamic, developmentally-regulated nuclear-architectural RNA that has
been difficult to characterize by conventional approaches. These experiments will develop a versatile and
straightforward technology for interrogating RNA interactions in situ, and which is easily adoptable by most
laboratories. Given the pervasive roles played by RNA throughout biology, this transformative method will pave
the way for paradigm-shifting discoveries in cell biology, and reveal novel RNA-based therapeutic targets."
10843201,"This is a proposal to renew an advanced postdoctoral training program focused on Alzheimer’s disease and related neurodegenerative disorders at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. There is a critical need to train early career scientists who will investigate Alzheimer’s disease and related neurodegenerative disorders, develop new interventions, and translate these findings from bench to bedside and from bedside to community. The program will continue to be housed in the Center for Cognitive Neurology, an extra-departmental, multidisciplinary program designed to foster collaborative research, with 37 faculty members serving as mentors. The goal of the program is to endow trainees with diverse scientific backgrounds with the necessary skills, multidisciplinary approaches, and rigorous methodologies to advance the field of Alzheimer’s disease and related neurodegenerative disorders. This renewal application expands our current training program by appointing exceptional cognitive neurology clinician-scientist researchers. We will build on our previous training program by appointing three postdoctoral trainees and one cognitive neurology fellow from a well-qualified pool of MD, MD/PhD, and PhD applicants. As per the NIH recommendation for postdoctoral research training, the trainees will be appointed for two years and will continue to receive mentoring and career development support in subsequent years. The program's goals to train these fellows will be accomplished through a tailored curriculum that includes training in rigorous research techniques and quantitative analysis, enhanced mentorship, didactics in foundational concepts, honing science communication skills, and career planning. This training program enables postdoctoral fellows to prepare for the intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary nature of modern research by providing: (a) high-quality scientific training in the area of Alzheimer’s disease and related neurodegenerative disorders, clinical approaches, statistical analyses, and rigorous experimental design; (b) enhanced mentoring that aids trainees’ progress toward future careers in science, and (c) training in the professional skills that are necessary for success in academic research, including critical reading, grant writing, oral presentation, leadership, management, and networking. The training of the next generation of research and clinician scientists with expertise in Alzheimer’s disease and related neurodegenerative disorders is, and will remain, a public health priority in the United States for many years to come. Our collaborative T32 program supports these early scientists as they launch their independent and successful careers in this critical field."
10841294,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Drugs are approved by regulators because they are relatively safe and eﬀective. However, there are
typically unanswered basic science questions about the detailed mechanisms of action, the impacts of
genetic and epigenetic variation, and the full range of phenotypic responses. This missing knowledge often
leads to reduced eﬃcacy and increased adverse events. My overall scientiﬁc goal is to generate more
complete understanding of the mechanisms of drug response and their sources of variation, in order to
enable more precise drug therapies.
 The last two decades has seen an explosion of data relevant to drug response. We have abundant
data about human genetic variation and gene expression (and other omic) proﬁles that illuminate key cellular
pathways in disease. Advances in protein 3D structure prediction provide useful models for most proteins,
which enable proteome-wide screening for oﬀ-target drug interactions. Biobanks, electronic medical records
(EMR), FDA adverse event databases and medical claims data provide clinical information and environmental
exposures. These data have biases and blindspots. My lab has a track record creating methods for analysis
of all these critical data types. We focus on computational/statistical approaches that integrate data at all
scales, thus reducing the biases within individual scales.
 In 2000, we created the Pharmacogenetics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) which curates information
about how human genetic variation inﬂuences variation in drug response. PharmGKB has high quality
information for 100s of drugs and genes, but pharmacogenetics typically explains far less than ~50% of
variation in drug response. I hypothesize that a large fraction of the remaining variation can be explained by
unknown oﬀ-targets, undiscovered pathways of drug response, genetic and epigenetic diﬀerences in
expression, and diﬀerences in environment and disease physiology. Thus, my proposed work focuses on
computational methods that use publicly available data to answer ﬁve driving questions: (1) What are the full
set of clinical responses to drugs, alone and in combination? (2) What are the molecular targets (particularly
oﬀ-targets) that are modulated by a drug? (3) What are the pathways that modulate drug response? (4) How
does genetic variation in targets/pathways lead to variation in drug response? (5) How do epigenetics create
variability in drug response? We will evaluate our methods with independent, held-out gold standard data
sets (to establish quantitative statistical performance), and collaborate with experimental colleagues to
validate key novel hypotheses. We will focus on genes and pathways that are critical in drug response for
under-studied diseases and in under-studied populations."
10842551,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is increasing appreciation for the role of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in shaping the transcriptome of
specialized cell types and in helping cells respond to stress. Macrophages are innate immune cells that mount
rapid and robust gene expression programs following detection of pathogen- and damage-associated
molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs). We know that this response is subject to post-transcriptional
regulation at the levels of alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation, RNA editing, etc. We also know that
many of the RBPs that control post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in macrophages are
differentially phosphorylated downstream of PAMP and DAMP sensing. We hypothesize that post-translational
modification of RBPs functionalizes them to coordinate the macrophage innate immune response. Tight
regulation is essential for a functional immune response: a weak response may be insufficient to fight infection
whereas a strong response risks cytokine storms, autoimmunity, and chronic inflammation. The role of RBPs in
post-transcriptional regulation of innate immune gene expression remains an understudied feature of this
important aspect of human health and disease. In the next five years, my lab will work to implicate new RBPs
in the macrophage innate immune response and to define new paradigms through which macrophages
reorganize their nuclei to activate innate gene expression. We have identified a cohort of RBPs in the
SR/hnRNP families of splicing regulatory factors that are differentially phosphorylated in macrophages in
response to PAMP/DAMP sensing. In the next funding period, we will work to uncover the molecular
mechanisms through which each of these factors (hnRNP C, hnRNP F, RALY, and U2SURP) influence
macrophage activation. We will study two complexes with the capacity to regulate many macrophage RBPs at
once: the biomolecular condensate/suborganelle known as the nuclear paraspeckle and the nuclear RNA
exosome. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the paraspeckle is dynamically up- and down-regulated over
the course of early macrophage activation, can sequester specific RBPs in response to PAMP sensing, and is
required for proper amplification of key inflammatory transcripts including Il6, Cxcl1, and Cxcl9. We found that
the RNA exosome can control paraspeckle dynamics and is required to maintain normal homeostatic levels of
antiviral transcripts in macrophages. Pursuing these lines of investigation will provide fundamental insights into
how specific RBPs and ribonucleoprotein complexes control the ability of macrophages to sense and response
to pathogens. By furthering our understanding of cellular stress responses and identifying novel nodes that
control of innate immune gene expression outcomes, our work may contribute to efforts to develop
therapeutics to help patients battling immune disorders and infection."
10842552,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Numerous cellular signaling pathways of critical importance to organism health rely on heterotrimeric G
protein signaling. Heterotrimeric G proteins are composed of Gα, Gβ, and Gγ subunits. Classically, ligand binding
to transmembrane G-protein-coupled-receptors (GPCRs) elicits conformational changes that lead to exchange
of GDP for GTP on the Gα subunit, and resultant separation of Gα from the Gβγ dimer, either or both of which
then signal to downstream effector proteins until intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα restores the heterotrimeric state.
 G proteins participate in numerous signaling cascades in both metazoan and plant systems and many aspects
of G protein signaling are remarkably conserved across this evolutionary divide. The overarching goal of my
research is to harness the simpler G protein complement of the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, to reveal how
heterotrimeric G protein genotypes and molecular phenotypes control cellular signaling cascades, and thus
whole organism consequences. Our laboratory has been a leader in plant heterotrimeric G protein signaling for
>25 years; we have elucidated G protein signaling via methods ranging from single cell electrophysiology to
imaging to -omics approaches, to sophisticated whole organism phenotyping and genome-phenome analyses.
 This proposal focuses on two types of molecular phenotypes – phosphorylation and natural variation -- and
their attendant consequences on G protein biochemistry, cellular signaling, and whole organism vitality. We have
ascertained that Gα phosphorylation at sites conserved across mammalian and plant Gαs can dramatically
impact the G protein cycle. In Theme 1, we plan to utilize >60 Gα phosphomimic and phosphonull lines we have
created to determine the phenotypic consequences of Gα phosphostatus. We will assess how phosphorylation
changes Gα molecular partners (i.e. how phosphorylation biases signaling), and phenotypic consequences. We
propose that phosphorylation “diversifies” the number of functionally distinct Gα proteins, resolving an apparent
mismatch between the number of G protein subunits vs. the much greater numbers of GPCRs and phenotypes.
 Some G protein mutations are known to cause disease. Many more are statistically “associated’ with disease
outcomes, but whether they actually cause disease is difficult to ascertain due to the high heterozygosity of
humans, low phenotypic penetrance, and inaccessibility of humans to experimentation. Arabidopsis is naturally
inbred and can be genetically manipulated with ease. In Theme 2 research, we plan to determine the impact of
natural missense single nucleotide variants (SNVs) on Gα biochemistry. We will next experimentally reveal in
Arabidopsis the phenotypic consequences of these mutations. Then we will ask whether, in nature, deleterious
SNVs are accompanied by other SNVs in Gα that forestall the negative consequences of the missense
mutations, in positive “intrageneic epistasis”. Next, we will assess intergenic epistasis between Gα variants and
regulatory proteins. Demonstration of such phenomena is both mechanistically revealing and will allow medical
science to better ascertain whether or not an individual with a given Gα SNV is actually predisposed to disease."

Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are core pathways mediating cellular responses to
a wide variety of extracellular and intrinsic cues. In the past several years, we have made progress in
understanding how connections are made in MAPK signaling networks, and we have exploited this
knowledge to identify new MAPK substrates and regulators. We plan to extend these studies along two
major lines of research. In the first, we will continue to investigate a role for non-catalytic “docking”
interactions in mediating specificity and signaling output by MAPKs. We have developed yeast-based
screening platforms to define sequence motifs selectively interacting with a conserved docking groove
in the MAPK catalytic domain. We have so far applied these methods to a set of MAPKs including
representatives of three major subfamilies (ERK, p38 and JNK). We plan to investigate novel MAPK
substrates uncovered through these screens, with a focus on crosstalk between JNK and small GTPase
signaling pathways. We further propose to expand our studies to include the remaining understudied
MAPK groups, for which few substrates are known. To understand how selectivity is enforced in MAPK
signaling systems, we will perform structural studies of MAPKs in complex with key regulators
interacting with the docking groove and other ill-defined interfaces. Our second line of inquiry follows
upon our recent discovery of the protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) complex as a MEK phosphatase that
negatively regulates oncogenic ERK signaling. Despite being conserved throughout eukaryotes and
essential to life in mammals, we know very little about the basic architecture and regulation of the
complex. We will investigate the basis for PP6 complex assembly, and we will define how interactions
with the catalytic and associated regulatory subunits confer substrate specificity. Finally, we will explore
a role for PP6 in mediating a negative feedback loop in the ERK signaling pathway. Collectively, our
proposed studies over the next five years will provide important new insight into the function of core
signaling pathways relevant to normal physiology and human disease."

Genome maintenance is essential for accurate cell and tissue function. The underlying repair needs differ based
on cell type and differentiation stage. Deciphering the mechanism that govern DNA repair is of significant interest
to public health, as defects in genome maintenance can drive diseases from degenerative disorders to cancer.
Although a multitude of DNA repair factors have been identified to date, there remains a profound lack of
understanding regarding the mechanisms that ensure appropriate repair factor engagement. The repair of DNA
damage is tightly coupled to the nuclear environment in which it occurs. We hypothesize that dynamic changes
in two fundamental regulators of mammalian DNA transactions, chromatin and nuclear RNAs, are essential to
control DNA repair outcomes across distinct physiological contexts. Our long-term vision is to understand, and
manipulate, how cell state transitions, both during differentiation and in disease, exploit these mechanisms to
adjust to altered genome maintenance needs. We will pursue this goal through two complementary projects,
combining our expertise in state-of the art genomics approaches and mouse genetics with innovative cell-based
tools to study DNA repair. In the first project, we will investigate how macroH2A1, the third-most common histone
H2A variant, links chromatin plasticity to DNA repair pathway choice. MacroH2A1 is alternatively spliced during
differentiation as well as in cancer, and we and others have identified distinct DNA repair functions associated
with each splice isoform, affecting both double- and single-stranded DNA damage. We propose that, by changing
macroH2A1 isoform expression, cells have the capacity to optimize repair outcomes in response to a variety of
DNA lesions. We will use isoform-specific knockout mouse models and a screen for macroH2A1 splicing effectors
to uncover how macroH2A1 isoform plasticity affects genome maintenance and dissect its physiological
consequences. In the second project, we will investigate the contribution of RNA and its modifications to DNA
damage control. RNA is required for the recruitment of certain repair factors, and RNA modifications have been
linked to DNA repair. However, we know little about the underlying mechanisms and functional implications. We
propose that, much like chromatin, RNA provides a tunable and dynamic means to control genome maintenance.
We will combine unbiased screening approaches with targeted validation to identify the factors that link RNA, its
modifications and their downstream effectors to DNA repair factor recruitment and pathway choice. A better
understanding of the molecular mechanisms that define DNA repair capacity will have implications for diseases
driven by impaired genome maintenance."

A major goal of stem cell research is to derive high-quality human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that
possess the unique transcriptional, epigenetic, and functional properties of developmentally unrestricted
“naïve” pluripotent cells found in the pre-implantation blastocyst in vivo. In contrast, hPSCs derived under
traditional conditions represent a more advanced or “primed” developmental state that corresponds to the
late post-implantation epiblast. My work and that of others has shown that primed hPSCs can be
reprogrammed into a naïve state marked by globally reduced DNA methylation levels, X chromosome
reactivation in female cells, and a broad capacity for differentiation along extraembryonic fates. However,
the widespread utilization of naïve hPSCs in biomedical research is currently impaired by epigenetic
instability during establishment and maintenance of the naïve state. In particular, naïve hPSCs generated
with currently available methods display irreversible erasure of parent-specific imprinting, retain an
epigenetic memory of the inactive X chromosome in female cells, and are not directly responsive to lineage
cues for embryonic germ layer induction. My long-term goal is to design rational strategies to derive naïve
hPSCs that faithfully recapitulate pluripotent cells in vivo and establish a robust cellular platform for
modeling human development and disease. Based on our published and preliminary data, I
hypothesize that aberrant epigenetic reprogramming during induction of naïve pluripotency is a
consequence of inappropriate signal perturbation. I propose to enhance the epigenetic fidelity of naïve
hPSCs by pursuing three complementary research directions. The first is to elucidate the signaling cascade
during early stages of the primed-to-naïve transition using quantitative phosphoproteomics, as a basis for
developing strategies to activate the naïve transcriptional circuitry without inadvertently inducing genetic
or epigenetic instability. Second, I will employ recently established fluorescent reporter cell lines in
combination with chemical and genetic approaches to preserve parent-specific epigenetic information
during the establishment of naïve pluripotency and promote random XCI upon exit from naïve human
pluripotency. Third, I will enhance the competence of naïve hPSCs for rapid induction of all three embryonic
germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm) by targeted epigenome editing of cis-regulatory
elements that gain accessibility during the transition from naïve to primed pluripotency. The overall aim of
this project is to exploit the presently untapped biomedical potential of naïve hPSCs and generate a robust
in vitro platform to model early human development and disease."

 The nucleosome is the hub of signals that regulate gene expression in eukaryotic cells. An important
mechanism of such regulation is the post-translational modification of the histone protein components of the
nucleosome. However, we possess only a rudimentary mechanistic understanding for how these modifications
are installed on the physiological nucleosome substrates by histone modification enzymes and subsequently
read by epigenetic reader proteins. These shortcomings limit our ability to interpret the wealth of genetic,
genomic and biochemical data available, and they hamper development of new therapeutics that target
epigenetic chromatin enzymes and readers associated with human diseases including cancer. We are
focused on addressing these deficiencies through structural and biochemical studies of histone modification
enzymes and readers in complex with the nucleosome. We leverage structural models produced using
cryoelectron microscopy to develop mechanistic hypotheses and then challenge these models through
nucleosome-based binding and enzymatic assays. Our studies of epigenetic histone modification enzymes
and readers should impact both our basic science understanding of gene regulation and therapeutics for
human diseases."

 As the population of individuals 65+ grows, so too will the number of individuals who struggle to manage
chronic health conditions. Exacerbations, or sudden symptom worsening, of chronic conditions place a burden
on the health care system and cause decreased quality of life and accelerated decline. Forecasting health
exacerbations can prevent life-threatening events or limit their impact. The long-term goal of this work is to
create a clinician-in-the-loop (CIL) smart environment that empowers individuals in managing their chronic
health conditions. Our proposed CIL framework partners clinical expertise with pervasive computing and
machine learning. In this system, sensor data are collected continuously by ambient and wearable sensors. Our
ML algorithms extract behavior markers to show to a clinician. Behavior changes are detected due to internal
(i.e., condition exacerbation) or external (i.e., wildfire smoke, shutdown due to COVID-19 pandemic) events.
Trained by clinicians, prediction of future condition exacerbations and health states are generated with
corresponding reliability scores. Correspondingly, clinicians will provide summaries of observed behavior,
reasons to confirm likely exacerbations, and recommendations to prevent health events. These summaries are
used to train a language model that will provide interactive explanations of future data and ML predictions.
Data are collected continuously by ambient sensors in the smart home and wearable sensors in Apple watches
to validate the findings and provide more complete monitoring. From smartwatch sensors, we will analyze the
predictive relationship between external events, social determinants of health, socialization, environment
quality, behavior, and health state. The result of these steps is an automated technology that can assist with
self-management of chronic conditions and monitor the impact of interventions. The proposed aims will be
validated using data collected in our prior study for n=44 older adults and in a new data collection with n=20
older adults. Participants in the restrospective study with historic data and prospective study with new data will
be older adults age 50+ living in independent homes who are managing one or more chronic health conditions.
Expanding the smart environment to encompass ambient sensors and wearable sensors increases the
accessibility of the technology for underserved communities and, when used in combination, improves model
robustness through joint prediction. Although clinical oversight of patient health will always be valuable, the
technology can provide an “informatics triage” that allows a clinician to remotely monitor a greater number of
individuals at a time and provide valuable information to the individual to assist in self-management.
Outcomes of this proposed study include open-source software for forecasting condition exacerbations,
software to train language models from clinician input, and the corresponding trained models; results of
analyses linking external influences, socialization, behavior, and health; apps for collecting ambient and
wearable data; and data that will be prepped for integration into the NIH RWDP platform."

Affiliative social interactions play an essential role in the reproduction and survival of social species including
humans. Its disruption in neuropsychiatric conditions or during times of social isolation such as the COVID-19
pandemic can take a heavy toll on mental and physical well-being. However, the neural circuit mechanisms
governing affiliative social behaviors are not well understood. Allogrooming (grooming behavior directed toward
another individual) is a major form of affiliative social contact through which animals may form, maintain, and
strengthen social relationships and is conserved in a wide range of social species, such as birds, bats, rodents,
canids, cats, equids, and primates. However, the neural circuitry underlying allogrooming has been sparsely
explored and few brain areas that encode and promote affiliative allogrooming have been identified. Deciphering
the neural circuit mechanisms of affiliative allogrooming will provide key insights into the neural basis underlying
social affiliation and attachment. Given the prominent impairment in affiliative social behavior in several
neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism and schizophrenia, this understanding can guide circuit-level
investigation of disease mechanisms and development of interventions. In recent studies, we established an
ethologically relevant and experimentally tractable paradigm for studying allogrooming behavior in laboratory
mice and uncovered a key role of a medial amygdala (MeA)-to-medial preoptic area (MPOA) circuit in controlling
this behavior. These findings open up valuable opportunities for in-depth dissection of the functional circuitry
underlying allogrooming behavior. The central objective of this application is to elucidate the neural circuit
mechanisms through which the MPOA controls allogrooming, which represents a critical next step toward
defining the functional organization of the neural circuitry of affiliative social behavior. We propose a series of
experiments to comprehensively probe whether and how the activity of select MPOA neuronal subpopulations
and their downstream targets regulate allogrooming behavior. Specifically, we will address the following
important questions: (Aim 1) Is allogrooming behavior controlled by select, molecularly defined MPOA
subpopulations? (Aim 2) Whether and how neural activity dynamics in MPOA neurons encodes social sensory
cues and allogrooming behavior? (Aim 3) What are the neural circuits downstream of the MPOA that mediate
allogrooming behavior? Our proposed research will integrate state-of-the-art techniques for functional
manipulation of specific neuronal subpopulations, in vivo imaging of neuronal activity dynamics in awake, freely
behaving animals, and functional mapping of neural projections to reveal how specific MPOA neuronal
subpopulations respond to conspecific cues and control the display of allogrooming through their downstream
projections. This investigation will yield novel, critical insights into the neural circuitry underlying an evolutionarily
conserved, major form of affiliative social behavior. Such insights will impact our understanding of social
cohesion and disconnection, such as in individuals experiencing social isolation or neuropsychiatric disorders."

Currently, there is a need for strategies that mitigate acute and delayed radiation syndrome. The risk of large
populations encountering radiation exposure is real and growing. Radiation induced inflammation plays
significant role in inducing radiation toxicity. Chemokine signaling plays key role in systemic and local
inflammation by modulating egress and recruitment inflammatory immune cells such as inflammatory monocytes
and T cells. Radiation exposure induces recruitment of inflammatory cells and promotes systemic and local
inflammation. We have observed that deletion of genes expressing chemokine receptor 2 in mice promotes
radiation resistance. Pharmacological inhibition of CCR2 signaling mitigates acute radiation syndrome in mice.
Moreover these animals receiving CCR2 antagonist treatment did not develop delayed effect of acute radiation
exposure (DEARE) such as radiation induced pulmonary syndrome. In this proposal we will examine the effect
of CCR2 inhibitor against radiation induced acute and delayed inflammation using mice model of acute and
delayed radiation injury. We will fully characterize CCR2 antagonist treatment with a determination of an optimum
dose and schedule for mitigation of radiation induced acute and delayed inflammation. We will examine the
general applicability of this strategy in young and aged animals. We will also characterize the effect of CCR2
antagonist in in modulation of bone marrow derived inflammatory immune cell release and recruitment in injured
tissue. Determination of mechanism of action of will facilitate CCR2 inhibitor as a medical countermeasure
against radiation under the FDA’s Animal Rule."
10845382,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Brain activity never ceases. When we are asleep, inattentive, or even under general anesthesia, networks of
interconnected neurons in the human brain continue to spontaneously generate complex activity patterns.
Sensory stimuli perturb this ongoing spontaneous neuronal activity. In order to be consciously detected, the
effect of this perturbation needs to be large enough so as to engage thousands of neurons and persist for at
least several hundred milliseconds. When we are awake and attentive, the smallest stimuli are sufficient to
elicit a large perturbation. Under general anesthesia, however, even the most noxious stimuli do not reach the
threshold for conscious perception. Here we address a fundamental question: why are sensory stimuli able to
perturb neuronal activity in some states but not in others? We hypothesize that the ability of the sensory stimuli
to perturb neuronal activity is related to the property of dynamical systems termed stability. If neuronal
dynamics were unstable, the effect of any perturbation would grow over time without bounds and engage ever
increasing number of neurons. Conversely, if the dynamics were too stable, then all perturbations will quickly
dampen down and fail to reach threshold of perception. Thus, we hypothesize that conscious perception is
most likely to occur when the neuronal dynamics are poised precisely between the stable and unstable
regimes. We refer to this point as critical. To test the criticality hypothesis, we developed novel mathematical
techniques and applied them to neurophysiological recordings in humans and in nonhuman primates. These
preliminary findings strongly support the hypothesis. In the proposed project, we will rigorously test the
criticality hypothesis using electrocorticography (ECoG) in human subjects implanted with electrodes for
epilepsy localization. We will determine how the stability of spontaneous activity varies as a function of sleep
and wake, attentiveness and drowsiness, as well as sedation and general anesthesia. We will validate the
criticality hypothesis and our ability to estimate stability of neuronal activity by predicting responses to electrical
brain stimulation. Using an auditory masked speech detection task, we will also determine whether stability of
neuronal dynamics can be used to predict whether a natural stimulus presented at perceptual threshold will be
consciously detected. While many other measures of neuronal activity have been previously associated with
changes in arousal and perception, at present, it is not possible to apply the existing measures to
unequivocally distinguish between activity in the conscious and unconscious brain. Hence, validating this
criticality hypothesis would be a major advance. In addition to addressing a fundamental issue in neuroscience,
finding an objective and quantifiable measure of sensory responsiveness has profound clinical significance in
neurology and in anesthesiology where diagnoses of covert awareness under anesthesia or after brain injury
cannot be made reliably with existing technology."

There is a growing consensus that men and women differ in their response to kidney injury, and their
susceptibility and progression to chronic kidney disease. Similar findings have come from the analysis of different
sexes in rodent models. Historically, females have been under-represented in animal modeling and clinical
studies. Redressing this imbalance and understanding how sex-related differences in gene expression are
generated, and how these influence normal and pathological actions within mammalian organ systems, is a
priority. Recent single cell RNA-seq studies in the McMahon group have highlighted extensive sexual
dimorphism within proximal tubule segments of the adult mouse kidney. Proximal tubule cells share a major role
in chemical modification of circulating metabolites with hepatocytes of the kidney. Proximal tubule cells also have
kidney specific actions in resorption, transport and removal of beneficial or harmful molecules. Comparative
analysis shows both similar and distinct sexually dimorphic gene sets between the liver and kidney, with potential
differences in hormonal interplay (androgens, estrogens, growth hormone) underlying how each organ
establishes dimorphic cell states. Pregnancy and nursing present additional demands on the female, specifically.
How these demands may impact dimorphic cell states in the female kidney is not clear, even in the mouse model.
Due to the absence of comparable, high quality, comparative data for the human kidney, there is no clear idea
of the extent of sexual dimorphism in the human kidney, and consequently, which regulatory actions may be
shared with mouse models, or are human specific. In this proposal, we will use single nuclear (sn)RNA-seq,
snATAC-seq and genetic approaches to determine the regulatory processes establishing sexually dimorphic cell
types in the mouse kidney, and those modifying gene activity within proximal tubule cell in the reproductive
process. Comparable datasets emerging from worldwide efforts applying single cell technologies to human
systems will be co-analyzed for shared and distinct regulatory processes. Specific Aim 1 will determine
regulatory mechanisms, including the action of direct hormone signaling (androgens, estrogen and growth
hormone), in generating distinct proximal tubule cell types in the male and female mouse kidney. Kidney datasets
will be contrasted with similar data for overlapping gene cohorts within sexually dimorphic hepatocytes. Specific
Aim 2 will determine the regulatory interplay of pregnancy, nursing and prolactin signaling in modifying sexually
dimorphic cell states in the mouse kidney. Specific Aim 3 will compare sexual dimorphism in the mouse with
human kidney biopsies, integrating data generated in the proposal into the framework of KidneyCellExplorer
(https://cello.shinyapps.io/kidneycellexplorer/) for viewing and analysis of the data."

Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is one of the most common muscular dystrophies in the U.S.
Currently, there is no effective treatment, and the pathogenic process is still not completely understood. Most
cases (>95%) of FSHD involve mono-allelic deletion of macrosatellite D4Z4 repeat sequences at the
subtelomeric region of chromosome 4q (FSHD1), while the remaining ~5% of cases demonstrate no D4Z4
repeat contraction (FSHD2). Mutations in the SMCHD1 genes were linked to FSHD2, and also greatly
exacerbate the phenotype of FSHD1 by acting as a modifier of the disease severity. Expression of the DUX4
gene encoded within the D4Z4 repeat is critically linked to the development of FSHD. Since overexpression of
DUX4 is cytotoxic in human myocytes and mice, it is thought that DUX4-induced cytotoxicity is the cause of
dystrophy. However, only ~0.1% of patient muscle cells appear to express DUX4, and DUX4 expression can
occasionally be observed in muscle cells from unaffected individuals. It is not straightforward to study FSHD in
model organisms as D4Z4 repeats and some of the critical DUX4 target genes are primate-specific. During the
previous funding period, we found evidence that DUX4-negative patient myocytes exhibit altered gene
expression distinct from control myocytes and cross-regulation of DUX4 target transcription factors contributing
to sustaining the DUX4 gene network. These findings strongly argue that FSHD mechanism is not simply
DUX4-induced cell killing and further investigation is necessary to understand FSHD pathogenesis. We also
developed genetically engineered mutant myoblast lines carrying D4Z4 deletion, SMCHD1 mutation or both to
simulate FSHD1, FSHD2 and severe cases of FSHD1, respectively and began to characterize epigenetic and
gene expression consequences of defined mutations in the isogenic background. Specific Aims of this project
are (1) to create additional mutant clones to interrogate the consequences of FSHD mutations in different
muscles with different disease susceptibility and during early myogenesis; (2) to investigate dynamics and
regulation of DUX4 and target gene expression, and (3) to identify a modifier gene(s) that dictates disease
susceptibility and severity. The successful outcome of the project should reveal DUX4 and target gene
dynamics and their contributions to FSHD pathogenesis and identify critical determinants for the disease
susceptibility, which may lead to identification of potentially new therapeutic targets."
10851928,"In mammals, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) first arise from a specialized hemogenic endothelium that lines
the developing embryonic aorta, migrate to and expand in the fetal liver, and ultimately colonize the bone
marrow, which supports hematopoiesis throughout adult life. These distinct anatomic locations harbor
specialized microenvironments that support the developmental maturation, expansion, and ultimately the
balance of self-renewal and differentiation of HSCs. The transcriptional programs that promote formation and
differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) have been widely interrogated, but much
remains to be learned about the supportive niche cells of the hematopoietic microenvironment and the
mechanisms of cell-cell interaction that specify HSC emergence during development, HSC migration, lodging,
and expansion in fetal niches, and the ultimate quiescence, self-renewal, and differentiation in the bone
marrow. In our preliminary data, we have gathered evidence for number of cell types, including endothelial
cells, mesenchymal cells, macrophages, neural crest derivatives, and somites as components of the
hematopoietic niche. We will gather comprehensive “omics” data to catalogue the gene expression programs
within the distinct hematopoietic niche cells that occur during development in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros
(AGM), fetal liver, bone marrow, and placenta (aim 1). Our approach begins with tomo-seq, which enables us
to discover gene expression patterns unique to cell populations like endothelium that have region-specific
specialization. We will validate cell-specific expression in FACS purified cells by single cell RNA-seq and in situ
hybridization, and will document functionality using morpholino and CRISPR knock-down in the experimentally
tractable zebrafish model. We then use ATAC-seq to define functional open chromatin around these genes,
and motif-finding software to identify DNA-binding regulatory factors that are candidate drivers of
hematopoietic cell fate. We will employ a computational pipeline and develop novel algorithms to analyze these
data (aim 2). Hypotheses emerging from aims 1 and 2 will be tested by constructing novel reporter strains of
zebrafish and mice, as well as engineered pluripotent stem cells carrying synthetic reporters and drivers (aim
3). Our goal is to define the molecular circuitry that specifies niche cells during the critical periods of HSC
emergence and expansion, and to probe cross-talk between niche elements and HSPCs. We hope to glean
unique insights into the molecular mechanisms that drive hematopoietic formation and maturation during
embryonic development, and to enhance our understanding of HSC maintenance, quiescence, self-renewal
and differentiation."
10851931,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Understanding the molecular biology behind weight regulation is imperative to address the growing epidemic of
obesity and the urgent need for therapies. The primary cilium has been identified as an important organelle for
signaling and function of eukaryotic cells including the cells involved in energy homeostasis. Ciliary dysfunction
results in several human syndromes, collectively called ciliopathies, that are associated with diverse
phenotypes affecting nearly every tissue and organ system. Some ciliopathies, such as Bardet-Biedl syndrome
and Alström syndrome, present with obesity in childhood. Primary cilia are known to be expressed in the
weight regulation centers of the hypothalamus. Loss of function in these primary cilia causes disruption in the
neuroendocrine signaling pathways involved in energy homeostasis, resulting in obesity. Animal models show
that disruption of ciliary gene(s) in neurons secreting pro-opiomelanocortin, the satiety producing neuropeptide,
causes hyperphagia and obesity. The number of genes identified to be involved in the function of the primary
cilium have increased over time. Recent evidence shows that the inositol phosphatase OCRL, a gene known to
cause Oculocerebral syndrome of Lowe (LS), is expressed in the cilia, and may have a role in regulating the
levels of phosphoinositol-4-phosphate and trafficking in the cilia. OCRL is also highly expressed in the
hypothalamus, especially the cells expressing the satiety neuropeptide, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), and
growth hormone releasing hormone. We have identified a family of two male siblings with a previously
unknown mutation in the C-terminus of OCRL that is only expressed in the brain specific isoform. The proband
has severe obesity and other diverse clinical features, different from those seen in LS, but overlapping with
ciliopathy. We hypothesize that this loss of function variant limited to the brain-specific isoform causes a
diverse phenotype including severe obesity, but does not affect the other somatic tissues. Thus, it provides a
unique opportunity to study the brain limited impact of the loss of function of OCRL. This proposal seeks to use
this phenotype to establish the role of OCRL as a ciliary gene involved in weight regulation in human and
mouse models. We will use our patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell line, their isogenic control and
allelic series to differentiate into arcuate-like hypothalamic neurons expressing POMC to assess the impact of
the mutation on the neuropeptide. We will also use conditional knockout of the gene by AAV-mediated RNA
interference in the arcuate and paraventricular nuclei of the brain in LS-specific humanized mouse model to
assess the phenotype. These studies will contribute a new gene to the growing list of genes involved in weight
regulation and ciliary function. It will also expand the phenotype for LS and potentially provide avenues to
explore therapies in future."

Allergic disease is a chronic inflammatory state where CD4+ T cells manifest a biased T helper 2 (Th2) cell
differentiation and effector phenotype. The polarization and ultimate effector function requires timed and
transient intracellular signaling regulated by positive and negative hemostatic factors. One such negative factor
we recently identified is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Both asthma
and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) are more common in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF, the
disease due to mutations in CFTR) and represent an exuberant CD4+ Th2 cell inflammatory response,
suggesting that CD4+ Th2 cells may be important in CF airway disease. We have studied the adaptive
inflammatory response to Alternaria alternata, a ubiquitous fungal aeroallergen that is associated with severe
asthma in Cftr-/- mice and found that compared to Cftr+/+ mice, Cftr-/- mice produce higher levels of the Th2
cytokines, IL-5 and IL-13. Moreover, Cftr-/- CD4+ T cells have increased in vitro Th2 polarization and cytokine
production compared to Cftr+/+ CD4+ T cells, suggesting that the absence of functional CFTR produces an
exaggerated Th2 response. Furthermore, we have found that the master regulator of Th2 cell differentiation
and function, GATA3, binds to the murine Cftr promoter following CD4+ T cell activation. Based upon these
preliminary results we hypothesize that CFTR functions to inhibit CD4+ T cell Th2 polarization and cytokine
production, and that CFTR expression is driven by GATA3 transcriptional activity. In Specific Aim 1 we will
determine the role of CFTR in negatively regulating CD4+ Th2 polarization and effector function. We will define
whether CFTR signaling is sufficient to inhibit Th2 polarization using CFTR overexpression in murine naïve
CD4+ T cells and whether endogenous CFTR expression inhibits Th2 cytokine production in Th2 polarized
murine CD4+ T cells. Specific Aim 2 will determine the importance on GATA3 binding on CFTR expression. We
will delineate whether GATA3 overexpression or transcriptional repression is sufficient or necessary for CFTR
expression, respectively. In Specific Aim 3 we will determine if CFTR modulation using recently FDA approved
small molecules capable of correcting or potentiating mutant and wild-type CFTR, 1) decreases Th2
polarization and/or effector function in healthy or CF human CD4+ T cells, 2) reduces Alternaria alternata
induced adaptive inflammation in a murine model expressing CFTR modulator-sensitive human CFTR, and 3)
decreases type 2 inflammatory biomarkers (IgE and eosinophils) in individuals with CF post-CFTR modulator
therapy compared to pre-CFTR modulator levels. Together these studies hold promise of elucidating the
importance of CFTR in CD4+ T cell biology and may represent a novel therapeutic approach to Th2 mediated
allergic disease. Importantly, this award will provide training in immunology from world-renowned
immunologists and cellular biologists to further my long-term goal of becoming an independent physician
scientist with expertise in pulmonary manifestations of CD4+ T cell mediated allergic disease."

Biofabrication is an emerging field that uses the controlled three-dimensional (3D) processing of materials to
produce structures (e.g., scaffolds, microparticles, microfluidic platforms) for use in biomedicine. Technologies
such as 3D printing, electrospinning, and photopatterning guide material structures to alter cellular behaviors,
with impact on the fields of tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, drug delivery, 3D cell culture, and in vitro
tissue models, across various tissue and disease systems. In order to capitalize on these advances and to train
a future workforce in biofabrication for academia, start-up companies, and mainstream industries, organized
educational programs are needed. We propose unique training that connects education in the fundamentals of
biofabrication techniques and quantitative methods to clinical applications and product-oriented design to
address major challenges in medicine. Our University of Colorado Boulder Biofabrication (CU BioFab) Trainees
will experience rigorous training in biofabrication via a newly developed lecture and hands-on course, industrial
engagement through coursework product design or participation in an industrial internship, co-mentoring by
clinical faculty to provide appropriate context to their PhD projects, an annual retreat to provide opportunities to
present their work across all stages of the program, and a bi-weekly seminar course that will harness webinars,
interactions with international biofabrication experts, soft skills development, and engagement with
entrepreneurship programs. We expect to develop a distinct trainee phenotype that exhibits: (a) decision-making
capabilities that balance innovative thinking with practical considerations (clinical applications, entrepreneurship)
and (b) leadership skills to make a meaningful impact on society. CU BioFab Trainees will become engineers
familiar with biofabrication techniques that are uncommon in traditional or even mainstream biomaterials and
bioengineering education, as well as industry and entrepreneurship interactions that are often missing in training
programs. CU Boulder is the place for such a training program, due to our extensive expertise across relevant
topics through our knowledgeable Preceptors, which include faculty in the Departments of Chemical and
Biological Engineering and Mechanical Engineering, as well as interdisciplinary graduate programs in Materials
Science & Engineering and Biomedical Engineering. Additionally, the infrastructure on campus, as well as the
extensive and growing biotechnology industry within the Rocky Mountain region, will guide the success of this
new training program."

The objective of the T32 Multidisciplinary Rheumatology Training Program at Johns Hopkins is to train and
grow a cadre of outstanding rheumatologists and scientists to become leaders across the biomedical research
enterprise, advancing knowledge and improving outcomes for those living with rheumatic disease. This goal is
directly aligned with the NIAMS mission to support training of basic and clinical scientists to conduct research
into the causes, treatment, and prevention of arthritis and musculoskeletal diseases. Over the past 20 years,
our program has demonstrated outstanding trainee achievement, in the areas of publications, appointment to
academic positions, acquisition of peer-reviewed funding, and leadership positions in national and international
organizations, including government and industry. In the current proposal we will pursue the following specific
aims to meet our goal: (1) Provide rigorous training in investigational methods applicable to clinical and basic
research; (2) Use clinical Centers of Excellence to access well-defined rheumatic disease patient populations;
(3) Provide access to outstanding resources, methodologic, and analytical expertise to facilitate research
success; (4) Engage trainees in high caliber collaborative research projects to address important questions
across the spectrum of rheumatic diseases under the supervision of multi-disciplinary, nationally-renowned
faculty; (5) Develop multi-layered, personalized mentorship teams for each trainee to foster successful
investigative careers; and (6) Assess program outcomes and modify to ensure maximal impact. We have
developed an outstanding infrastructure to support training and research that is grounded in disease-specific
Centers of Excellence, closely integrating clinical care and research. This is linked to a highly productive and
collaborative group of program faculty and mentors that incorporate multidisciplinary investigative teams to
explore novel areas of research and ensure project success. Our diverse program faculty represent the
breadth of interests and expertise across the clinical, translational, and basic science disciplines, and are
proven mentors in rheumatic diseases, immunology, molecular biology, genetics, cell biology, epidemiology,
and biostatistics supported by individual, collaborative, and institutional research grants. We have engaged
highly expert internal and external advisory committees to provide advice about the program's priorities,
systems, and directions. We use a matrix approach to develop multidisciplinary mentoring teams for trainees
around specific research projects. These projects are guided by individual development plans, formal course
work, and core conferences and include instruction on responsible conduct of research and ensure scientific
rigor and reproducibility. Postdoctoral trainees may pursue a Master’s degree in Health Sciences, Public
Health, Immunology, and Biomedical Engineering and additional coursework to further their investigative skills.
Our innovative and highly effective training program coupled with this T32 resource will foster the development
of the next generation of academic Rheumatology investigators and leaders."
10931684,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We propose to develop a novel non-contact, label-free multimodality imager that provides real-time intraoperative
identification of nerves within the surgical field-of-view to facilitate the prevention of unintended nerve damage
(termed iatrogenic nerve injury) during surgical procedures, as they are a major source of postsurgical
complications, e.g., chronic pain. In the United States chronic pain management is a major putative contributing
factor in the current opioid-related drug overdose epidemic. Annually, over 45 million surgical procedures are
performed in the United States and an estimated 10% to 50% of them result in patient chronic postoperative pain
outcomes. Though not all the at least 4.5 million are definitively ascribable to iatrogenic nerve injury, it
nonetheless represents a significant recurring annual healthcare problem. Relatedly, analysis of large-scale
nerve lesion treatment studies reveals that 25%, 60% and 94% respectively of sciatic, femoral and accessory
nerve lesions addressed are caused by iatrogenic nerve injury.
Additionally, iatrogenic nerve injury features prominently in post-surgical quality of life issues that range from
loss of sensation and motor function to the aforementioned chronic pain, and morbidity. Reportedly, 2-3 years
post radical prostatectomy ~60% of men are still impotent as a result of damaged cavernous nerves. Likewise,
20% - 60% of mastectomy breast cancer treatment survivors suffer chronic post-surgical pain that significantly
reduces their quality of life, and injury to the intercostobrachial nerve is the primary cause. Even in surgeries with
minimal neural damage risk like acoustic neuroma removal (<1%), spinal scoliosis surgery (<0.6%), and
thyroidectomy (<2-3.8%) the consequences of nerve damage can be severe: leading to deafness, paraplegia,
and even death respectively. The associated financial implications of iatrogenic nerve damage are significant.
There are direct financial costs to the individual due to loss of employment and/or income, and to the healthcare
industry as nerve damage is a common source of litigation with compensation being awarded in 82% of cases
of spinal accessory nerve injury, for an example. The exposure of healthcare personnel and providers to
medicolegal liability is extensive as Iatrogenic nerve injuries are commonly reported on the laryngeal nerve
during thyroid operations, trigeminal nerve and inferior alveolar nerve during facial and oral surgeries, intercostal
nerves during thoracic surgeries, and on the spinal accessory nerves, common peroneal nerve, superficial radial
nerve, and genitofemoral nerve branches during various other surgeries. Consequently, as of 2022, medicolegal
litigation risk was a primary driver for a $1.5 billion global market for intraoperative nerve monitoring projected to
grow at 5.1% annually through 2030. Our proposed solution targets filling both the deficiencies of currently
available options and the growing demand by introducing an effective, commercially viable product."

HIV persists long-term in the central nervous system (CNS) even in the presence of antiretroviral therapy (ART).
One strategy to target HIV reservoirs in the CNS is to develop interventions aimed at enhancing the breadth and
magnitude of CD8 T cells, which can penetrate and persist in the brain as tissue resident cells. Our group has
shown that HIV-specific CD8 T cells can limit HIV reservoir seeding in acute infection in the periphery when ART
is initiated during acute infection. We have developed unique tools to analyze these cells in the cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) and showed that HIV-specific CD8 T cells can also be detected in the CSF during acute HIV infection
and persist in the CSF for up to 2 years after ART initiation. Importantly, the presence of these HIV-specific CD8
T cells is beneficial for limiting neuroinflammation but not enough to fully eliminate HIV reservoirs in the CNS.
The goal of this project is to test whether the immunomodulation of innate-like and adaptive CD8 T cells via a
novel IL-15 super-agonist (N-803) can significantly reduce HIV CNS reservoirs without causing neurotoxicity.
Indeed, IL-15 promotes strong activation and expansion of HIV-specific CD8 T cells and improves their ability to
kill reactivated HIV reservoir cells in vitro. IL-15 enhances memory CD8 T cell generation and persistence in
tissues as well as trafficking to the CNS. IL-15 can also promote the conversion of CD8 T cells into antigen-
independent innate-like effector cells, as well as the activation and expansion of NK cells. In nonhuman primates
(NHP), IL-15 enhanced the function of SIV-specific CD8 T cell responses resulting in reduced plasma viral loads
and increased the migration of SIV-specific CD8 T cells to B cell follicles. These results have supported the
evaluation of IL-15 immunomodulatory potential in HIV remission strategies. However, the potential for IL-15
immunotherapy to reduce HIV persistence in the CNS remains unknown. In this project, we will study the impact
of IL-15 on innate-like and adaptive CD8 T cells in two human HIV remission clinical trials in which participants
receive N-803: the RV550 trial in Bangkok, Thailand, administering 3 doses of N-803 at time of ART initiation
during acute HIV infection, and the ACTG A5386 trial administering 8 doses of N-803 in people with HIV on ART
and undergoing an analytic treatment interruption. We will also conduct two NHP experiments following the
design of the two human trials, that will provide us with access to brain tissue at necropsy. Collectively, these
studies we allow us to determine whether N-803 administration in acute infection is safe for the CNS and can
enhance HIV-specific CD8 T cell-mediated reduction of the CNS reservoirs. We will also determine whether
repeated dosing of N-803 given during ART facilitates innate-like CD8 T cell-mediated reduction of CNS HIV
reservoirs. These results should help define mechanisms by which CD8 T cells can clear HIV reservoirs from
the CNS as well as CNS safety during an immunomodulatory intervention that may ultimately inform on the
development of therapeutic strategies to eradicate the HIV reservoirs from the CNS.

The malaria parasite P. falciparum continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality, with 228 million clinical
cases and 405,000 deaths in 2019. With progress towards controlling malaria stalling in many high burden
countries and the continuing spread of drug resistant parasites, an effective malaria vaccine is urgently needed.
RTS,S, a vaccine currently under implementation, has modest efficacy (~30%) and immunity waning rapidly.
Importantly, this vaccine does not target the disease-causing forms of the parasite. An efficacious vaccine
targeting Plasmodium blood-forms is required to reduce parasite burden, clinical disease and sequelae to severe
disease. Our proposal aims to address this gap by developing a multi-modal P. falciparum vaccine targeting the
blood-stage parasite and evaluating its efficacy using a relevant primate model of human malaria. We will build
this multi-modal vaccine by incorporating two vaccine candidates with distinct effector mechanisms. The
individual components have been tested rigorously and reproducibly in pre-clinical efficacy models. The first is
a sub-unit vaccine candidate (AMA1-RON2L complex), designed to enhance antibody quality by increasing the
proportion of neutralizing antibodies targeting AMA1. Using a structure-based approach we have now designed
this subunit vaccine to cover AMA1 polymorphisms and generate strain-transcending, neutralizing antibodies.
The second is a whole blood-stage parasite vaccine that induces a strain-transcending, anti-parasite response
through direct cell-mediated killing. This multi-modal vaccine will be formulated with a novel cationic liposomal
adjuvant that potently activates both the humoral and cell-mediated arms of the immune system, thereby
providing a human-compatible adjuvant platform. We will perform dosing studies to optimize the P. falciparum
multi-component vaccine in mice and evaluate impact of biological sex on the vaccine-induced immune
response. We will also assess memory B cell and T cell responses induced by the multi-modal P. falciparum
vaccine (Aim 1). Next, we will assess immunogenicity and protective efficacy of this multi-modal vaccine against
homologous and heterologous P. falciparum in Aotus nancymaae and evaluate the persistence of the immune
responses using a delayed re-challenge model (Aim2). Lastly, we will use validated immunological assays and
apply cutting-edge technology (single-cell RNASeq) to help inform our understanding of immune correlates of
protection. The major deliverable of this project will be a novel, pre-clinically validated, multi-modal P. falciparum
blood-stage vaccine in a human-compatible liposomal adjuvant that can be progressed towards clinical trials."
10832489,"ABSTRACT
Neuropsychiatric disorders are thought to arise from complex changes of brain plasticity. Recent evidence
points toward ion channel complexes as cellular hubs of plasticity that confer disease vulnerability or protection
depending on the channel regulatory state. In medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc),
a subtype of highly vulnerable cells, neuroadaptive changes in intrinsic firing are mediated by neurotrophin
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling.
Yet, the molecular
mechanisms by which these changes occur are still poorly understood.
Intrinsic firing in MSN relies on the integrity of the macromolecular complex of the voltage-gated Na+ (Nav)
channel Nav1.6 and its accessory regulatory fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14) and is subject to regulation by
glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) β, a downstream effector of BDNF/TrkB signaling. Here, we provide
exciting new evidence for the Nav1.6, FGF14 and GSK3β as a macromolecular signaling complex downstream
of BDNF/TrkB critical for MSNs neuronal plasticity. Using an array of in vitro and in cell assays, cell imaging,
and electrophysiology, we show that stability, phosphorylation and functional activity of the Nav1.6 channel are
proportional to the level of BDNF and the kinase activity, whereby low level of
BDNF predicts resilience and
high level mediates a susceptible phenotype conferred by changes in neuron firing. We will conduct a full
range of biophysical, biochemical and electrophysiological studies combined with pharmacological and viral
vector-based in vivo gene transfer methods to evaluate the impact of BDNF/TrkB signaling on macromolecular
composition (Aim 1), subcellular targeting (Aim 2) and functional properties (Aim 3) of the Nav1.6 channel in
the context of neuroadaptive plasticity of MSNs. Outcomes of these studies could potentially lead to the
development of biomarkers of susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders by investigating molecular pathways
in relevant experimental models, an area of great interest for biological psychiatry."

The genetic architecture of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is complex and ongoing efforts to decipher it have
focused on both common and rare genetic variants. Our investigative team has added significantly to current
understanding of ASD genetic risk and to the functional impact of identified genes. Despite our large-scale
genetic analyses, there remains a number of unanswered questions, one of which is whether its genetic
architecture differs across ancestral populations. Notably, there has been no systematic effort to investigate this
in Hispanic and Latina/Latino populations, the largest minority population in the United States (~60 million, 18%
of the total population), and growing rapidly. Inclusion of under-represented populations in genetic studies is
important both for scientific reasons and for parity. This proposal therefore encapsulates 2 NIMH priorities: we
will investigate genetic risk for ASD in people of Hispanic/Latinx ancestry. To further our understanding of ASD
in Hispanic/Latinx populations, we propose to: 1) recruit, phenotype and sample at least 1,600 additional
Hispanic/Latinx ASD trios, thereby expanding our existing sample set of well-characterized Hispanic/Latinx ASD
samples; 2) genotype and sequence all samples in the cohort and combine results with the Autism Sequencing
Consortium and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, large-scale efforts on rare and common genetic variation,
respectively; 3) analyze common genetic variation in the cohort using cross-ancestry genome-wide association
studies (GWAS), develop ancestry-informed polygenic risk scores, and contribute to fine-mapping and
colocalization of top GWAS findings; and, 4) carry out genetic association studies for rare genetic variants in the
cohort, taking special care to account for ancestry, especially for rare inherited variation. At the successful
conclusion of the proposed studies, we will have four important results: a deeper understanding of how rare and
common variation contribute to risk for ASD across ancestries; enhanced fine-mapping of ASD GWAS loci;
better, more portable PRS for diverse ancestries; and a larger number of known ASD risk genes. In addition, we
will have contributed to improving methods for integrating samples of diverse ancestry in genomic studies and
will have enhanced recruitment of under-represented populations in such studies."

The relevance of inversions for disease causation, speciation and adaptation, is broadly and prominently
recognized although the prevalence is unknown. In humans, de novo inversions are associated with congenital
anomalies in ~9.6% of patients. Yet, despite the biological relevance of inversions, their molecular features,
formation mechanism, impact to the genomic structure in carriers, as well as their contribution to clinical
phenotypes, have not been further explored. Inversions are typically classified as a balanced reciprocal event
generated by ectopic recombination, although recent studies reveal a distinct picture whereby inversions
originate from mechanisms that concomitantly generate copy number variants (CNVs). Surprisingly, those
complex inversions underlie as much as 30% of neurodevelopmental defect-associated CNVs. The hypothesis
of this application are: i. inversions are often generated de novo by mechanisms other than ectopic
recombination; ii. a relevant fraction of inversions are associated with complex genomic rearrangements
(CGRs) often overlooked in sporadic diseases, and iii. inversions are a “hidden” type of structural
variation for which contribution to a clinical phenotype has been under assessed due to the lack of
appropriate detection tools. These hypotheses will be tested by virtue of the following specific aims: i) to define
the relative contributions of distinct DNA repair mechanisms to the formation of inversions; ii) to establish whether
CGRs are genomic signature of inversions; and iii) to investigate the scale of contribution of de novo inversions
to sporadic diseases. To overcome the limitations of each methodology, a combined strategy of multiple genomic
tools will be applied to characterize inversions and associated genomic alterations, consisting of whole genome
sequencing (WGS) short-and long-reads, genome mapping classical cytogenetics, array CGH and/or SNP
arrays. The results obtained in this application will lead to a more broadly definition for the term inversion, enable
estimate of the contribution of mitotic and meiotic DNA repair mechanisms of their formation and reveal the
frequency of origin and underlying genomic architecture. Moreover, it will identify candidate genes affected by
that structural variant for further genetic and functional validation. In summary, this application will strongly impact
our understanding of human biological processes and disease mechanisms associated with inversions with
broad implications for diagnosis of birth defects, human development, infertility and cancer. This application will
also establish common grounds to bridge studies of rare and common diseases, human evolution and population
genetics."
10832613,"Project Summary
Half of children with cerebral palsy (CP) have dysarthria, which has well documented negative effects on
speech intelligibility. A primary aim of treatment is improving speech intelligibility. Current pediatric dysarthria
interventions focus on clear and/or loud speech, phonation, speech rate, or some combination of these. While
several interventions have resulted in intelligibility gains, there is substantial variability in outcomes. Additional
interventions are needed to ensure that intelligibility can be maximized for all children. Laboratory studies have
consistently identified the articulatory system as the largest contributor to intelligibility deficits in dysarthria,
implicating variables such as vowel space and F2 slope. However, these measures are not clinically accessible,
nor do they translate to specific treatment targets. Given the primacy of the articulatory system to intelligibility
and developmental malleability associated with the acquisition of speech in children, there is a need for
sensitive metrics to quantify articulation using clinically meaningful units (i.e., speech sounds). Such metrics
would enable us to understand how different speech sounds contribute to intelligibility and would lead to
advancements in the development of data-driven interventions for improving intelligibility in children with
dysarthria, complementing existing therapies. Our goal is to develop a clinical tool that yields objective,
continuous, and automatic quantification of speech sound articulation from connected speech in children; we
will use this tool to quantify the contributions of individual phonemes to intelligibility. To do this, we will use
state-of-the art speech analytics involving machine learning for acoustic modeling, and clinical research in
speech pathology to refine and validate algorithms that specify a phoneme log-likelihood ratio (PLLR) for each
phoneme in English. We will use the PLLR to create growth curves for the development of phoneme articulation
based on data from 750 typically developing children between the ages of 2 ½ and 10 years, and to
characterize the contribution of individual phonemes to intelligibility by age in these children. We will then
examine 700 longitudinal speech samples from children with dysarthria between the ages of 2 ½ and 10 years,
and identify how they differ from typical children in phoneme development and how speech sound articulation
contributes to intelligibility. The outcome of this research is an algorithm that can quantify phoneme articulation
in children, indicating a child’s performance relative to norms for each phoneme. Results will specify the relative
contribution of individual phonemes to intelligibility, and how this changes developmentally and in the context of
dysarthria. A fine-grained understanding of the impact of dysarthria on phoneme development and subsequent
contributions to intelligibility has never before been feasible and will have direct clinical and theoretical
implications. Results will lay the foundation for new assessments and treatments for improving intelligibility in
childhood dysarthria."

trachea to target diseased T-cells and fibroblasts without side effects of systemic mTOR
inhibition. Through a combination of in vitro and in vivo modeling, participation from patients with
iLTS, and a novel biomaterials approach, the investigator team is uniquely poised to transform
our understanding and treatment of LTS. Preclinical validation of mTOR inhibition as a
treatment for LTS is a critical step prior to translation to human studies."
10832521,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
A more universal vaccine against influenza virus infection is urgently needed. However, a major obstacle
limiting more effective and durable vaccines against influenza infection stem from the rapidly shifting nature of
viral immune dominant epitopes. Further confounding this obstacle are functional differences in the
immunological responsiveness to vaccination and susceptibility of individuals to natural infection primed by
prior exposure to influenza antigens. This type of immunological imprinting likely explains the wide discordance
in effectiveness of current seasonal influenza vaccines. Considering the near ubiquitous exposure of
individuals to influenza virus, together with the wide variability in clinical symptoms from asymptomatic to
severe infection and increasingly widespread use of seasonal immunization, immunological imprinting to
influenza virus is likely initiated during infancy with the first exposure to natural infection or immunization.
Importantly, critical knowledge gaps remain regarding how individuals respond to primary influenza exposure in
early life, in the context of natural infection or vaccination, and how a lack of pre-existing immunity effects
within-host influenza viral diversity. It is also unclear how this first exposure to influenza impacts the
subsequent immunological responsiveness to antigenically identical, similar or discordant influenza epitopes.
For infants, the impact of vertically transferred maternal immunity, or that acquired postnatally through
breastfeeding, on the quality of ensuing influenza specific immune responses remain unclear. To fill these
knowledge gaps, ongoing recruitment of a maternal-infant cohort at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital will be
expanded, along with parallel efforts in Mexico City. Both sites have ongoing surveillance providing additional
cases of symptomatic primary infection. With the proposed enrollment of more than 2000 pregnant women, our
two-site cohort is ideally suited for the proposed studies given our established infrastructure of weekly nasal
swabs and symptom reporting, scheduled blood collection to detect asymptomatic and symptomatic influenza,
maternal and cord blood and milk sample analyses and detailed evaluations of susceptibility and
immunological responses to influenza infection and vaccination in mothers and infants. Our overall hypothesis
is that primary influenza exposure in early life impacts the magnitude, durability and breadth of immunological
memory to an evolving range of influenza virus antigens and this initial imprint will have a profound effect on
subsequent influenza exposures. A team of investigators with complementary expertise in pediatric infectious
diseases, epidemiology, maternal-infant cohorts, human B and T cell immunology and influenza virology have
been assembled to address our hypothesis by investigating the immunological response of infants to primary
influenza virus natural infection compared with immunization (Aim 1), compare the immunological response
against an initial exposure to influenza virus via natural infection or immunization in infants (Aim 2), and
investigating the impact of pre-existing influenza immunity on virus genetic diversity within individuals (Aim 3)."
10832644,"The purpose of this competing continuation grant proposal is to develop, evaluate and apply
 methodological and statistical procedures to investigate how prevention programs change outcome
 variables. These mediation analyses assess the link between program effects on the constructs targeted
 by a prevention program and effects on the outcome. As noted by many researchers and federal
 agencies, mediation analyses identify the most effective program components and increase
 understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading to changing outcome variables. Information from
 mediation analysis can make interventions more powerful, more efficient, and shorter. The P. I. of this
grant received a one-year NIDA small grant and four multi-year grants to develop and evaluate mediation
 analysis in prevention research. This work led to many publications and innovations. The proposed
 five-year continuation focuses on the further development and refinement of exciting new mediation
 analysis statistical developments. Four statistical topics represent next steps in this research and include
 analytical and simulation research as well as applications to etiological and prevention data. The work
expands on our development of causal mediation and Bayesian mediation methods that hold great
promise for mediation analysis. In Study 1, practical causal mediation and Bayesian mediation analyses
 for research designs are developed and evaluated. This approach will clarify methods and develop
 approaches for dealing with violation of testable and untestable assumptions. Study 2 investigates
 important measurement issues for the investigation of mediation. This work will focus on methods to
identify critical facets of mediating variables, approaches to understanding whether mediators and
 outcomes are redundant, and develop methods for studies with big data. Study 3 continues the
development and evaluation of new longitudinal mediation methods for ecological momentary assessment
data and other studies with massive data collection. These new methods promise to more accurately
model change over time for both individuals and groups of individuals. Study 4 develops methods to
 uncover subgroups in mediation analysis including causal mediation methods, multilevel models, and new
 approaches based on residuals for identifying individuals for whom mediating processes differ in
 effectiveness from other individuals. For each study, we will investigate unique issues with mediation

10893584,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The main goals of this training proposal is 1) to provide Li Li, MD, PhD, a practicing anesthesiologist at the
University of Washington, with additional scientific and professional skills to facilitate his transition to become an
independent investigator, and 2) to better understand how the locus coeruleus (LC), at the cellular and circuit
levels, contributes to opioid-induced sleep disturbances. Studying sleep disturbances caused by opioids is
important because opioids have enormous societal impact, causing over 46,000 overdose deaths in 2018 and
almost $80 billion in economic cost annually in the United States; and because recent studies have implicated
several aspects of sleep disturbances caused by opioids, including poorer cognition, decreased pain tolerance,
and increased negative affect, in contributing to chronic opioid use and relapse. Interestingly, the LC and
paraventricular thalamus (PVT) are two brain regions that modulate sleep-wake balance and mediate withdrawal
behaviors from opioids, but their roles in opioid-induced sleep disturbances are relatively unknown. Thus, during
his K99 phase, Dr. Li aims to 1) examine LC neuronal activity in relation to sleep patterns in a mouse model of
acute and chronic opioid administration and 2) determine the role of local opioid receptors in the LC in opioid-
induced sleep disturbances. Furthermore, he plans to receive training in 1-photon microendoscopic imaging,
optogenetic manipulation of opioid receptors, and cell-specific drug targeting using drug acutely restricted by
tethering (DART); and will be mentored by Prof. Michael Bruchas, a world-renowned expert in opioid
neurobiology, and a committee of experts in neural circuitry analysis, sleep, and substance abuse disorders.
Together, his training will help transition to his independent R00 phase, where he plans to use his trained skills
1) to examine PVT neuronal activity in relation to sleep patterns in acute and chronic opioid administration, and
to determine role of local opioid receptors in PVT in opioid-induced sleep disturbances. Studies in the
independent phase will prepare him for a future R01 submission to further examine arousal neural circuitry
response to sedative and anesthetic drugs. Thus, this proposal aims to characterize the LC-PVT circuit in a
mouse model of acute and chronic opioid administration using cutting-edge tools in neural circuit analysis and
cell-specific pharmacology in order to better understand the cellular and circuit mechanism underlying opioid-
induced sleep disturbances, and provides the essential training and mentorship for Dr. Li to help him achieve his
career goal of starting his own lab and becoming an independent investigator."
10833041,"Multimeric Peptide Copolymer Formulations for Targeted Drug Delivery to Treat
Nervous System Disorders
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neuromuscular disease that leads to
progressive muscle wasting, autonomic dysfunction and death within 5 years of
diagnosis, and each year >16,000 people are diagnosed. As research has made
tremendous strides in understanding the cellular mechanisms that underlie disease
progression, pre-clinical research has demonstrated the potential of nerve growth factor
(NGF), glial derived and neural derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF and BDNF), and
targeted biologics to halt disease progression. However, the clinical translation of
therapeutics to treat ALS and other nervous system disorders has lagged due to
complications associated with systemic administration or transient blood-brain barrier
damage. By using a bacteriophage biopanning strategy to perform an affinity based
screen, we aim to exploit a CNS entry pathway similar to rabies virus infection to
circumvent the barriers of systemic delivery and target therapeutics to neurons directly.
Thus, we propose to identify novel targeting peptides and biologics delivery strategies to
treat nervous system diseases. By using a bacteriophage biopanning strategy to perform
an affinity based screen, we have recently identified a peptide motif, TAxI, that mediates
uptake and delivery of a biologically active protein to the CNS after intramuscular
injection. Here, we demonstrate the ability of CNS targeting-peptides to deliver a model
drug into the CNS after IP injection. We propose to evaluate how aging and disease
progression impacts targeted drug delivery to the CNS with the goal of designing and
synthesizing materials for pre-clinical testing in a model of ALS. In this proposal, we
build upon TAxI by developing copolymer materials and a human TAxI-peptide for
translatable CNS delivery formulations to deliver biologics into the diseased CNS non-
invasively."
10833152,"Trauma Communication Center Coordinated Severity-Based Stroke Triage
Acute stroke systems of care should emulate trauma systems which deliver the full range of care to all
injured patients by means of organized, coordinated efforts in defined geographic areas. Just as trauma
systems have proven ability to save lives of the most severely injured patients, we should have a stroke
system able to provide care to patients with the most severe strokes. The most severe type of acute ischemic
stroke is due to proximal large vessel occlusion (LVO). Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) offers an extraordinary
potential to improve the outcome of patients with LVO. Unfortunately, in part because MT is available only at
advanced stroke centers, only a minority of patients with LVO are treated with MT, and there are racial,
socioeconomic, and rural disparities in access to MT. Based on the success of trauma systems and our prior
collaboration, the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) is planning a five-year statewide quality
improvement initiative of trauma communications center (TCC) coordinated severity-based stroke triage
(SBST) which aims to transform the fragmented acute stroke care system by coordinating prehospital and
inter-facility emergency stroke care. This provides a “natural experiment” allowing assessment of both the
public health impact and the “how and why” of implementation of an innovative acute stroke care model. We
aim to (1) compare the proportion of patients encountered by the emergency medical service (EMS) with
suspected LVO who are treated with MT before (adhering to standard triage to the nearest stroke center) and
after implementation of TCC coordinated SBST; (2) assess the broad public health impact of TCC coordinated
SBST by examining the reach and effectiveness of the intervention (including any differences by race, ethnicity,
and population density), the fidelity of implementation, and ability to sustain the model in various settings;
and (3) assess stakeholder perceptions of the intervention’s feasibility, appropriateness, and acceptability and
identify barriers and facilitators to the intervention’s adoption, implementation, maintenance, and spread. This
will guide future implementation efforts. To accomplish these aims, we will expand our successful model of
TCC guided stroke severity assessment to all EMS regions in Alabama; use qualitative methods including
interviews and focus groups to aid in the development of region and hospital specific prehospital and inter-
facility stroke triage plans for patients with suspected LVO; and implement a phased rollout of TCC
coordinated SBST across Alabama’s six EMS regions, lending itself to analysis of health processes and
outcomes before and after the intervention in each region. To address implementation AIM 3, we will use a
mixed methods approach using multiple methods consisting of surveys, interviews and focus groups. This
project, if successful, can serve as a model for how the trauma system infrastructure that already exists in other
regions and states can serve as the basis for a more integrated and effective system of emergency stroke care."
10833162,"Anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) typically nucleate when individuals experience a highly traumatic event. One hallmark of PTSD is pronounced expression of fear and resistance to fear-suppressing behavioral therapies. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is important for mediating both the expression and inhibition of learned fear. Specifically, the human dorsal anterior cingulate and ventromedial (vmPFC) subdivisions of mPFC are generally believed to be responsible for mediating the expression and inhibition of fear, respectively. However, several studies have suggested that in addition to its fear-inhibiting role, activity in the vmPFC is associated with increased anxiety in non-human primates and humans. Moreover, vmPFC activity is elevated in a third of PTSD patients. More strikingly, damage to the vmPFC has been suggested to protect against the development of PTSD. Despite its clear relevance to pathological fear behaviors, the mechanisms underlying this functional dichotomy in vmPFC remain unclear. Rodents are routinely used to study the mechanisms of fear memory regulation due to their numerous circuit parallels with humans. Similar to the vmPFC in humans, the rodent vmPFC mediates the inhibition of fear and can be divided into two anatomically distinct subregions, including the infralimbic (IL) and dorsal peduncular (DP) cortices. While both vmPFC subregions are thought to mediate the inhibition of fear, all studies have centered on IL and there are no studies that explicitly examine the potential contributions of DP during the regulation of memory. In contrast to its hypothesized role in mediating fear inhibition, my preliminary data indicate that DP is engaged during the expression of conditioned fear and exhibits evidence of fear learning-dependent plasticity. Based on these data, I propose that DP encodes learned fear through learning-dependent excitatory and inhibitory plasticity. To test this hypothesis, I propose to pursue the following two aims: 1. Resolve the activity dynamics and long-range targets of fear-activated DP neurons by using Miniscope in vivo calcium imaging in DP, anterograde circuit tracing, and combining the use of in vivo optogenetic manipulation of fear-tagged DP neurons and fiber photometry in target brain regions. 2. Determine the circuit mechanisms leading to fear learning-dependent DP recruitment by combining in vivo optogenetic manipulation of DP-projecting populations and fiber photometry in DP. We will also employ ex vivo electrophysiological measurements of experience- dependent plasticity of long-range projections to DP in a cell type-specific manner. Results from this proposal will be the first to characterize the role of DP in the regulation of fear memory, to outline how it integrates into existing models of fear circuitry, and to delineate the circuit plasticity mechanisms ensuring is recruitment after fear learning."
10836833,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goal of our research program is to delineate molecular mechanisms that regulate cell
proliferation and differentiation in the context of animal development. This knowledge will help to advance
the understanding of normal processes in the developing multicellular organisms, explain why dysregulation
of these mechanisms leads to disease, and provide strategies to ameliorate these unwanted effects. We
focus on the highly conserved Retinoblastoma (RB) pathway, which is involved in plethora of biological
processes but is best known for its role in cell cycle control. One of the key targets of the RB pathway is the
E2F family of transcription factors that is negatively regulated by the Retinoblastoma protein (pRB).
Mammalian RB research has traditionally centered around its prominent role in cancer and therefore, its
function in development remains poorly understood. A major hurdle to studying the RB pathway in
mammalian development is redundancy and compensation, as the large multigene Rb and E2F families
make genetic analysis daunting. The Drosophila model system provides an attractive alternative because
the Drosophila RB pathway is highly conserved yet it is simpler. In previous years, we have focused on
identifying tissues and functions of E2F and Rbf, the fly pRB ortholog, that are essential for animal viability.
During these studies, we have found that the RB pathway is particularly important in adult skeletal muscle.
Surprisingly, in the muscle, both E2F and Rbf are needed in late muscle development to directly activate
the expression of metabolic genes. We will use genomics approaches coupled with genetic analysis to
investigate the molecular details of E2F/Rbf dependent activation. We will focus on the role of E2F/Rbf at
enhancers and how the loss of E2F/Rbf binding at these regulatory regions changes chromatin state and
gene expression. Previosuly, we have found that the phenotype of E2F deficient animals is a combination
of both tissue intrinsic and systemic effects. Our future research will build on this discovery to determine
why E2F inactivation in skeletal muscle leads to lethality. Another area of interest is focused on interaction
between the RB pathway and Hippo signaling pathway. Combined inactivation of both pathways leads to
photoreceptor dedifferentiation because the cells inappropriately turn on the eye progenitor transcriptional
program, which is dependent on Homothorax (Hth) and Yorkie, a transcriptional effector of the Hippo
pathway. Our future experiments will leverage the power of single cell genomics and single cell epigenomics
to determine the upstream regulatory events and identify the role of Hth-Yorkie in transcriptional regulation
in dedifferentiating photoreceptors and in normal eye progenitor cells. Collectively, the proposed research
will advance our understanding of normal development and animal physiology, and how perturbations in
growth pathways may lead to disease."
10837728,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Approximately 40 million people are currently infected by HIV, with an additional 1.7 million people newly
infected each year. While only a single person has been functionally cured of HIV, advances in antiretroviral
therapy (ART) have drastically decreased AIDS-related illnesses and deaths for individuals on ART. However,
HIV+ patients on ART still face debilitating AIDS-independent diseases, including HIV-associated
neurocognitive disorders (HAND). HAND refers to a spectrum of three neurocognitive disorders that influence
survival, quality of life, and everyday function: asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), mild
neurocognitive disorder (MND), and HIV-associated dementia (HAD). While the number of patients with the
more severe forms of HAND have declined since the introduction of ART, an estimated 15-55% of HIV+
patients taking ART still develop a neurocognitive disorder. Patients with ANI are two to six times more likely to
progress to a more severe form of HAND when compared to HIV+ patients who are neurocognitively normal.
Thus, HAND remains an important and prevalent HIV-associated disease to affect individuals in the ART era.
 It is now thought that HAND develops because of functional changes in neurons caused by chronic
inflammation and HIV infection of an immune cell in the brain, microglia. Though they are not a neuronal cell,
microglia do play an important role in the general health and function of neural tissue. The immune responses
of microglia are thought to be tightly regulated and controlled as to not normally harm the surrounding neurons.
We do know that HIV can infect microglia. However, little is known about the progression of acute and chronic
HIV infection in microglia nor how and what impact these infected cells have on surrounding neuronal tissue.
Moreover, HIV infection is frequently associated with intravenous drug us such as heroin along with the
growing abuse of prescription opioids. It remains unclear how the use of these drugs alters both neuronal and
innate immune signaling and further contributes to HAND.
 One major roadblock in understanding infection of microglia has been the lack of systems for analysis in
culture, as well as means for studying their impact on human brain functions. Recent developments in human
pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived microglia and 3D-brain organoids have opened new doors to understand
HIV infection in these otherwise intractable cells. We have begun to bridge this knowledge gap by leveraging
our strengths in HIV and brain organoid biology to model HAND in culture, where we can finally begin to
answer important questions in the roles of HIV, opioids, and microglia and other cells in this debilitating HIV-
associated disease. Success of our proposed research will 1) define the response of microglia to HIV infection
and opioid treatment, 2) characterize how dysregulated microglia affect brain organoid structure, neural
network health, and signaling, and 3) establish a foundation for therapeutic discovery to reduce
neuroinflammation and HAND."
10837844,"Abstract
Perinatal care continuity across the full continuum is essential for optimizing maternal and infant health; however,
a stark gap occurs postpartum, with less than one half of Indian mothers receiving postpartum care due to
significant logistical and sociocultural barriers, particularly for peri-urban and rural residents. To overcome these
barriers and reduce women’s postpartum isolation, our international team of maternal and infant health clinicians
and researchers developed and pilot-tested a culturally-tailored mobile interactive education and support group
intervention: Maa Shishu Swasthya Sahayak Samooh (maternal and child health support group: MeSSSSage).
 MeSSSSage uses a provider-moderated group approach to increase women’s communication with
providers, refer to in-person care, and connect them with a virtual social support group. Participants are recruited
in late pregnancy and have 26 education and support sessions via audioconference facilitated by nurse-midwives
(2 prenatal and weekly postpartum sessions through 6 months), plus engage in a text chat group. Pilot results
indicated high acceptability and feasibility and suggest preliminary effectiveness.
 We propose to test the effectiveness of the MeSSSSage intervention compared to standard care on maternal
and neonatal health-related behaviors and health outcomes in a randomized controlled trial among 2100
perinatal Indian women. Primary outcomes of exclusive breastfeeding, unmet need for postpartum
contraceptives and postpartum depression will be assessed at 6 months. Our specific aims are to: estimate
the effectiveness of a mobile interactive education and support group intervention (MeSSSSage) on
postpartum behaviors for optimizing maternal and neonatal health in India (Aim 1), characterize the
mechanisms of impact of the MeSSSSage intervention on maternal and neonatal health in India (Aim 2),
and determine the cost-effectiveness of the MeSSSSage intervention in improving postpartum maternal
and neonatal health as compared to the standard of care.
 We hope to positively impact women’s postnatal health knowledge and behaviors and improve health
outcomes for women and their infants in the first six months postpartum. This study of a scaleable intervention
will have an important contribution to the evidence base on mHealth for maternal and perinatal health and group
care models for postnatal care, contributing to reducing disparities in women’s access to care through the
removal of geographic and social barriers.

Project 3. Latent and Lytic EBV Infection in Epithelial Cells
Shannon Kenney, Project Leader; Eric Johannsen, Co-Leader
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an important cause of human epithelial cell cancers, particularly undifferentiated
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), but the precise mechanism(s) by which latent EBV infection promotes NPCs
are poorly understood. EBV also induces oral hairy leukoplakia (OHL) lesions in the tongue epithelium of AIDS
patients, which is caused by completely lytic EBV infection in differentiated squamous epithelial cells. We
recently discovered that latent EBV infection inhibits differentiation, and promotes proliferation, of a telomerase-
immortalized normal oral keratinocyte cell line (NOKs), and that this effect is mediated by the latent EBV protein,
LMP1. Our exciting preliminary results show that LMP1 affects NOKs proliferation and differentiation by
activating the downstream targets of the Hippo tumor suppressive pathway, YAP and TAZ. Conversely, we have
discovered that the ability of EBV to enter lytic viral infection in NOKs is induced by cellular differentiation and
requires the differentiation-associated proteins, IRF6/RIPK4, as well as KLF4/BLIMP1/YAP/TAZ, although the
pathways that regulate lytic EBV reactivation during differentiation are not yet fully defined. In Project 4, a
collaboration between the Kenney and Johannsen labs, we will dissect how the latent EBV oncoprotein LMP1,
in conjunction with YAP/TAZ, inhibits epithelial cell differentiation and enhances proliferation (both key steps in
the pathway to tumor formation), and further define how lytic EBV reactivation is activated by differentiation-
dependent mechanisms in normal epithelial cells. In Aim 1, we will define how LMP1 activates YAP and TAZ,
and inhibits cellular differentiation, in NOKs. In Aim 2, we will identify novel cellular genes/pathways that drive or
inhibit lytic EBV in NOKs. In Aim 3, we will ask if FDA-approved drugs that inhibit or activate YAP/TAZ activity
block the growth of EBV+ epithelial cell tumors and/or regulate lytic EBV reactivation. We hypothesize that LMP1
inhibits differentiation by activating YAP and/or TAZ (Aim 1), that epithelial cell differentiation induces lytic EBV
reactivation at least partially though activation of the RIPK4/IRF6 axis (Aim 2), and that YAP/TAZ inhibitors will
impair the growth of EBV-infected NPCs
and gastric cancers
expressing LMP1 (Aim 3). This project involves
collaborations between multiple investigators, including Dr. Kenney, Dr. Johannsen and Dr. Lambert, and will
use multiple Cores, including the virus core, the microscopy core, and the administrative core."

The United States population is rapidly aging, and as it does the complexity of care and challenges to
maintaining health continue to grow. This is especially true for older adults from vulnerable populations
(OAVP), including those from sociodemographically disenfranchised communities who experience disparities
in health care and outcomes, those with complex chronic illnesses, and those with dementia. Concerningly,
research on OAVP is not keeping pace with the growth of these populations, owing in part to the shortage of
investigators with clinical training in the care of older adults. For these reasons, we propose a T32 research
training program with the long term goal of producing new investigators whose work leads to improvements in
the wellbeing of OAVP. There will also be special research emphasis on health care delivery in the home as
this care modality has shown great promise for improving outcomes for OAVP and Mount Sinai has
considerable research and clinical experience with home-based medical care. The OAVP T32 will prepare
scholars for successful research careers through: (1) Outstanding research training (well-match
interdisciplinary mentorship team, diverse project opportunities, promotion of interdisciplinary collaboration,
excellent research didactics through degree granting programs [MPH, MSCR, PhD], research skills
development specific to the challenges of working with OAVP, training in the responsible conduct of research);
(2) Insight into the clinical care and experiences of OAVP patients through limited clinical geriatrics training
involving didactics and direct care responsibilities or shadowing for non-clinician scientists; (3) Professional
career skills building (seminars on manuscript and grant writing and oral presentation skills, networking and
collaboration opportunities, exposure to non-academic careers to broaden perspectives on professional
avenues for improving care and outcomes for OAVP. The program will recruit 2 new post-doctoral scholars in
each year of the 2-year training program, 10 in total, including physicians (MD/DO), non-physician clinicians
with doctoral level training (e.g., RN, social worker, pharmacist with PhD or equivalent degree), and non-
clinical post-doctoral scientists. Among physicians recruited to the program, most will lack geriatrics clinical
training. Didactic training will occur through formal courses and seminars. Scholars will publish research
manuscripts, present at national meetings, apply for career development awards and other research grants,
and transition to full-time faculty-level positions in research or a related field in which their research skills can
be effectively applied for the care of OAVP. The Program Director (PD) will work with the Program's Executive
Committee to make key decisions about program management. The PD and Executive Committee will be
guided in their work by Internal and External Advisory Boards, comprised of experts who can provide high level
input into program performance and direction and growth. A broad but feasible and salient set of measures will
be collected to guide the growth of the individual scholars and their mentors, and the program overall."
10840483,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is the 2nd most common, age related, hematological malignancy with an estimated
30,000 new cases and 13,000 deaths per year. Patients with upfront refractory disease progress fast, and those
that enter remission eventually die as a consequence of relapsed disease. To increase patient survival, clinicians
need new ways of selecting effective and durable therapies for relapsed and refractory MM patients. Antibody
(Ab) based treatments that target cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38), a transmembrane protein consistently
expressed in MM cells, is a promising therapy for relapsed and refractory MM patients. Currently, there are three
CD38 targeted monoclonal Abs (mAbs) in the clinic for MM patients, daratumumab, isatuximab and MOR-202.
These Abs are safe, well tolerated and show remarkable efficacy in ~30% of myeloma patients. It is unknown
why the majority of remaining patients do not respond to CD38 targeted mAb therapy and why there is such
variability between patients. Functionally, CD38 is a pleiotropic antigen that acts as an enzyme as well as a
receptor. The extracellular enzymatic component of CD38 is responsible for the metabolism of nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to downstream Ca2+ signaling molecules. There is growing evidence that variability
in CD38 targeted therapy response in MM cells could in large part be contributed to the changes in its NAD
enzymatic activity. Here, we posit that while CD38 expression is important, the monitoring of CD38 enzymatic
activity in concert with spatiotemporal imaging is key to linking MM response to CD38 targeted therapies. We
propose to address this question using Positron Emission Tomography (PET), which is a powerful molecular
imaging tool that can be directly applied to quantify receptor expression and functional activity in vivo, non-
destructively and longitudinally. We have shown that PET imaging of CD38 antigen on MM cells is feasible using
the radiolabeled CD38 mAb daratumumab. A limitation of this approach however is that Abs are not suited for
longitudinal imaging studies due to their long biological half-life. High-affinity peptide based small molecule
imaging agents can effectively overcome these limitations since they are rapidly taken up by tumor tissue while
being promptly cleared from non-target organs in vivo. Despite the unmet need, there is a paucity of CD38
targeted small molecule peptide based PET probes for MM. Using innovative phage display technology, we will
develop new CD38 targeted peptide-based PET imaging probes that are specific for enzymatically activate CD38
conformation. Furthermore, in highly relevant biological systems, we will evaluate molecular pathways as well
as spatial relationships that govern MM-associated CD38 expression. The specific aims are: (1) Aim 1a. Identify
and validate changes in CD38 expression and enzymatic activity before and after CD38 targeted therapies in
human mouse models of MM. Aim 1b. Evaluate spatiotemporal CD38 expression based on PET imaging. (2)
Aim 2. Develop, evaluate and optimize novel high affinity CD38 targeted peptide PET probes.
In summary, the current proposal is innovative and potentially clinically transformative since it seeks to identify
those MM patients who are most sensitive and most resistant to anti-CD38 monoclonal immunotherapy."

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) remains a devastating neurodegenerative disorder
that slowly compromises normal cognition and behavior, leading to death. In 2022, the national cost of
caring for ADRD patients was estimated to be $321B with an additional $271B in unpaid costs incurred
due to caregiving by family and friends. Despite this staggering statistic, there exist few treatments and no
cures for ADRD. A major impediment in designing interventions and therapies is the involvement of
heterogenous genetic risk factors, lifestyle factors and co-morbidities. Unraveling such a multifarious
pathogenetic mechanism would require scientists to cross traditional boundaries between disciplines.
Towards this, we had designed an interdisciplinary research and professional training program for
predoctoral students from a basic research department (Neuroscience) and a clinical department (Clinical
Health Psychology) at the University of Florida (UF). Since its inception in 2018, we have graduated 8
students and we have disseminated didactic knowledge and scientific discourse to our T32 community and
beyond. Notably, of the 18 trainees in our program, 11 are female and 6 are from disadvantaged
backgrounds. In this past funded cycle, UF leadership delivered close to $1.1M in Institutional support they
originally promised in the application. To continue this ADRD training framework, we now seek renewal
of our ongoing T32 program, in the form of the Clinical & Translational T32 in ADRD (CaTT-ADRD)
program. In this renewal application, we seek continued support to sustain a cross-disciplinary, diversified
and translational training program designed for pre-doctoral students to foster their professional and
academic trajectory into successful translational scientists in ADRD. Our renewal application introduces
new mentors and training inclusive of the artificial intelligence initiative at UF. We have been fostering the
next generation of ADRD scholar-leaders within our preceptor cohort, with one of these preceptors joining
our leadership in this renewal application. As before, our institution demonstrates their clear support for
this T32 program by providing direct Institutional support as well as general shared resources support. The
overarching goal of this proposal will be to build upon the outstanding existing infrastructure of
neuroscience training and the vast expertise in ADRD and clinical aging research at UF. Overall, our aims
are to provide (1) cross-disciplinary mentorship in research concepts and methodology, scientific analysis
and interpretation; (2) opportunities to train and interact with faculty who are leading authorities in the field
of ADRD and aging; (3) support for diverse dissertation committees that include secondary mentors to
promote broad-based and comprehensive training; (4) personalized mentorship for professional
development including grant writing, research communication, and networking; and (5) impetus to establish
programs to ensure continuing recruitment and training of underserved students."
10848834,"Historically, human diseases have been described (and treated) based on their symptomology. Increasingly,
however, elucidation of the molecular and functional underpinning of diseases is transforming our capacity to
develop targeted therapeutic interventions. In the era of CRISPR, our ability to generate precise models of
genetic diseases has been greatly improved, but unfortunately, a major bottleneck remains in our capacity to
measure and interpret the resulting phenotypes. Moreover, most phenotypic measurements of animal models
are qualitative, require expert human assessment, are narrowly focused based on the interests of individual
labs, or are difficult to compare to other phenotypes. Together, these issues constrain our ability to generate
the mechanistic genotype-phenotype maps that are necessary to understand how organisms are built, how
health is maintained, and how these processes are disrupted in human diseases. Thanks to recent
technological advances, it is now realistic to contemplate large-scale, systematic disease model generation
and characterization. One of these advances is Multiplexed, Intermixed CRISPR Droplets (MIC-Drop), a
technology that combines CRISPR, microfluidics, and barcoding to enable high-throughput gene disruption in
zebrafish. By combining MIC-Drop with single-cell RNAseq and with automated physiological and behavioral
assays, it is now possible to generate and characterize disease models with unprecedented depth and
efficiency. Using this approach, we propose to target all human-disease-associated transcription factors in the
zebrafish genome. This project will generate animal models for hundreds of human disease genes, along with
single-cell transcriptomic data and detailed physiological and behavioral phenotypic descriptors for each
model. These data will be analyzed using computational techniques to detect, categorize, and interpret mutant
phenotypes that are otherwise intractable to manual curation. These data will be made available in a variety of
formats to enable exploration of deep phenotypic data for all these disease models. We anticipate that this
resource will improve the utilization, accessibility, and translational value of animal models to the research
community."
10852900,"Project 1
Project Summary Abstract
This is a renewal application of a long-standing P01 grant. Our central hypothesis is that Extracellular
Vesicles(EVs) or “exosomes” reprogram the tumor microenvironment of Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) and that
these processes also affect neighboring EBV infected cells in the lymph nodes. In Sub-Saharan Africa,
where both KSHV and EBV are endemic, approximately 40% of KSHV shedders also shed EBV”. Hence,
we expect that even asymptomatic persons will have viral derived EVs in their circulation. About 1011 /ml
EVs circulate in human plasma, as compared to ~104 infectious KSHV particles during systemic KS. The
endothelial lining of blood and lymphatic vessels are continuously exposed to systemically circulating EVs
and these are the lineage of origin for KS. All KSHV-derived EVs carry all KSHV microRNAs. If only one in
a million plasma EVs are derived from a latent or lytic KSHV-infected cell, more KSHV miRNAs are
transferred by EVs than viral genomes by virions. New this funding period, we will probe the interaction of
KSHV EVs on EBV pathogenesis, image single EV particles, and explore novel ways to repurpose natural
EVs for targeted KS therapy."

Project Summary Abstract
Globally, oncogenic DNA viruses cause a significant cancer burden. These viruses establish life-long
persistence in the human host and are associated with the development of epithelial, endothelial, and B cell
cancers. The human gammaherpesviruses Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated virus
(KSHV) are associated with B cell lymphomas, Kaposi’s sarcoma, gastric cancer, and nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (NPC). Moreover, human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with oropharyngeal and cervical
carcinoma.
In this application, we propose to explore how the oncogenic gammaherpesviruses, KSHV and EBV, modulate
cellular pathways including adenosine-related signaling pathways and how they contribute to oncogenesis.
Investigating the various mechanisms involved in modulation of host immunity and oncogenesis by these
tumor viruses will inform our understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of these viruses. Our findings will
also pave the way for future therapies to treat virus-associated cancers."
10854270,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Community redevelopment policies that aim to move families from communities of concentrated poverty into
mixed-income communities have the potential to positively transform the lives of those families, reducing
barriers and providing opportunities for sustained upward social mobility and better health outcomes. However,
transitions into mixed-income communities are not without challenges, including the potential for highlighting
economic inequality and increasing exposure to discrimination and social exclusion, especially among youth of
color (e.g., Chaskin et al., 2013; Odgers & Adler, 2018) and older youth. This Diversity Supplement presents a
unique opportunity to examine whether improvements in academic or health outcomes following a transition
into high quality, mixed-income housing are mediated by shifts in social mobility beliefs which then help youth
better take advantage of new social connections and opportunities in their mixed-income community. Aim 1:
Use mixed methods to track whether beliefs about social mobility shift in response to changes in housing and
community contexts, and whether these shifts vary by age. Aim 2: Examine whether changing housing and
community contexts affect academic and health outcomes by shifting beliefs about social mobility. Aim 3:
Assess whether the consequences of social mobility beliefs vary based on racial-ethnic identity. Clarifying the
mechanisms that affect why and for whom benefits accrue is essential for creating better community
redevelopment policies and improving opportunities for economic mobility."
10850192,"Project Summary/Abstract
Exposure therapy is the most effective treatment available for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), yet up to
50% of patients do not recover. Progress has stalled because we do not fully understand how or why exposure
exerts its effects. Studies that test mechanistic theories of exposure (based on habituation or inhibitory learning
models) have yielded mixed findings for both self-report and physiological mechanisms, with a near exclusive
focus on group-level effects in tightly controlled settings. While exposure likely works differently for different
people, research on which mechanisms are most important for which individuals has been absent. As a result,
clinicians are left to navigate mixed findings from different theoretical models, leading to variability in how they
conduct exposure and greater treatment failures among patients suffering with OCD. The primary objective of
this proposal is to determine which target mechanisms are most critical to engage in real-world exposure
sessions to produce treatment response. Adult participants (N = 400) with OCD receiving exposure therapy
from two sites (McLean Hospital, San Diego State University) across the continuum of care (outpatient, partial
hospital, residential) will complete baseline clinical and demographic measures as well as weekly symptom
reports. We will measure exposure mechanisms across three levels of analysis (self-report, observer-rated
behavior, physiology) during each exposure session. Mechanisms assessed will include a broad range of
variables based on both habituation and inhibitory learning models of exposure. For self-report and observer-
rated mechanisms, we will use the Exposure Feedback Form (EFF), created and piloted by the study team.
For physiological mechanisms, we will measure skin conductance response, heart rate, and heart rate
variability via a wearable device. Leveraging machine learning analyses, we will develop a predictive model of
patient outcomes (OCD symptoms) that incorporates both mechanistic data and baseline demographic and
clinical characteristics. At the group level, we will test the hypotheses that incorporation of mechanistic
variables will improve predictive performance over baseline variables alone, and that greater habituation and
inhibitory learning will predict superior clinical outcomes. At the individual level, we will test the hypotheses that
lower baseline depression and greater anxiety sensitivity will predict stronger habituation-outcome
relationships, whereas lower baseline self-efficacy and sexual minority identity will predict stronger inhibitory
learning-outcome relationships. This will be the first study to predict mechanism-outcome relationships for
exposure therapy based on individual characteristics. Consistent with NIMH’s Strategic Objective 3, this
proposal aims to identify therapeutic targets for personalized interventions by utilizing innovative machine
learning approaches with scalable methods. Future studies will translate insights gained from this project to
test implementation of personalized medicine approaches to exposure therapy, with the ultimate goal of
improving care for the many patients who do not remit following exposure for OCD."
10850414,"Adolescents low in socioeconomic status (SES) are nearly twice as likely to smoke cigarettes or
vape and are more likely to use alcohol, cannabis, and illicit drugs than high-SES adolescents.
This study will add to our understanding of adolescent substance use because it will examine
SES discrimination. SES discrimination refers to the bias that individuals experience based on
SES. Minority stress theory highlights how the stress experienced from discrimination is
associated with substance use. Indeed, adult studies show that SES discrimination is positively
associated with substance use. Yet, this line of inquiry has not been extended to adolescents.
To our knowledge, there is only one study, and it indicated that maternal SES discrimination
was positively associated with adolescent tobacco use. Recognizing a gap in the field, the PI
created a new conceptual model for adolescent SES discrimination that includes overt
(harassment) and subtle (microaggressions) forms. The model draws from adult studies on
SES, racial/ethnic, and sexual orientation discrimination and adolescent studies on racial/ethnic
and gender discrimination. The PI’s new preliminary work supports the model and shows how
overt SES discrimination is positively associated with tobacco use, even after controlling for
SES. The proposed research will advance our knowledge with three specific aims: To (1)
examine how adolescents’ experiences with SES discrimination intersect with discrimination
based on race/ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation, (2) determine how SES discrimination
is associated with substance use in adolescents, controlling for discrimination based on
race/ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation, and (3) investigate how associations between
SES discrimination and substance use are moderated by subgroups, including SES,
race/ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation. Providing new knowledge is critical for informing
programs that reduce and prevent substance use by targeting SES discrimination. We propose
a mixed-methods study that includes interviews (N = 40) and surveys (N = 800) in 2 public high
schools. The schools have a broad representation of SES (School 1 includes 77% low-income
students and School 2 includes 20% low-income students). The study will be conducted in an
experienced university lab that has established long-term partnerships with the high schools.
Active consent procedures will be used. Consistent with the R16 aims, underrepresented
students will be extensively involved. The PI’s track record with mentoring includes 50
undergraduate and 20 graduate students, 4 students advanced to PhDs, and 28 publications
with student co-authors. Strategies to recruit and train students are planned."
10850767,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Biotechnology advances in research settings are rapidly growing, but the gap between translational medicine to
clinical utility is lacking. In addition, there is a disconnect between undergraduate bioengineering education and
workforce skills development that reduces the bioeconomy human capital needed to address critical
biotechnology and biomanufacturing infrastructure in the United States. The proposed project aims to bridge the
gap between biotechnology research and clinical applications by developing a bench-to-industry-to-bedside
pipeline for undergraduate and graduate biomedical engineering students. Through team-based learning
experiences, the project emphasizes collaboration and feedback cycles among critical stakeholders in
biotechnology and biomanufacturing. The objectives include augmenting existing biotechnology design courses
with emerging technologies such as adeno-associated viruses, recombinant protein production, and chimeric
antigen receptor T cells that reinforce common innovation and manufacturing pipelines for student teams. We
will also integrate industry and clinical mentorship from local biotechnology companies and medical practice and
incorporate ethical frameworks in biotechnology design cycles. To address healthcare equity with rising costs of
novel biotechnologies and information access, student designs will emphasize human-centered universal design
and education to diverse populations as part of comprehensive needs assessment and stakeholder analyses.
By enhancing the Duke Biomedical Engineering curriculum with advances in gene, cell, and molecular therapy,
the project seeks to cultivate essential bioengineering skills for a future in molecular and cellular medicine. The
intended educational outcomes include fostering skill development in molecular, cellular, and genetic
engineering, promoting successful transitions into careers in the biomedical research workforce, and equipping
students with the knowledge and experience to navigate the evolving biotechnology landscape and needs of all
biotechnology stakeholders. With an estimated impact on approximately 100 undergraduate students and 50
graduate students over the five-year duration of the project, this program aims to significantly contribute to the
bioeconomy and advance the translation of biotechnology advancements into clinical applications."
10850288,"Project Summary
Approximately 1 in 5 people living today will die at some point in the future due to a cardiac arrhythmia. However,
despite decades of research, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Genetic studies have
provided important new insights into the underlying mechanisms by identifying mutations in calcium (Ca) cycling
proteins that cause arrhythmias. One of the best studied is Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular
Tachycardia (CPVT), which is an inherited disorder that can cause sudden death during exercise or stress in
patients with structurally normal hearts. However, it is not understood how a point mutation in a Ca signaling
protein can ultimately lead to a cardiac arrhythmia, which involves the breakdown of electrical excitations at the
organ scale. To address this challenge, the applicants propose to develop a multi-scale computational framework
to link CPVT mutations to dangerous electrical excitations in cardiac tissue. Their approach is to perform
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the binding between Calmodulin (CaM) and the Ryanodine Receptor
type 2 (RyR2), in wild type (WT) and mutants, and then to link this data to higher scale computational models of
the cell and tissue electrophysiology. This computational framework will link the following important scales
relevant to arrhythmias: 1. Molecular scale interactions at the CaM-RyR2 binding interface. 2. Ca release within
a cardiac cell due to Ca sparks and waves. 3. Ca triggered electrical excitations in cardiac tissue. The specific
aims of this project will be devoted to developing a computational toolkit that is tailored to each relevant scale,
and which can be systematically linked to scales above and below. In aim 1, they will use high resolution crystal
structures to construct MD simulations of the CaM-RyR2 binding interface. Based on these simulations they will
compute the binding affinity between CaM and RyR2 in the presence of an array of point mutations on CaM.
Also, they will apply MD to determine the key binding interactions that are disrupted by specific CaM mutations.
In aim 2, they will construct a biophysically based model of the RyR2 channel that accounts for the reaction
kinetics between CaM and RyR2. This model will utilize the binding affinity computations in aim 1 to determine
the difference between WT and mutants. Once this model is constructed, they will then evaluate how a specific
CaM mutation regulates Ca leak from the SR via spontaneous Ca sparks and induces dangerous action potential
(AP) perturbations due to Ca waves. In aim 3, they will develop a phenomenological model of Ca and voltage
dynamics of a cardiac Purkinje cell that can be used to simulate millions of cells in the Purkinje fiber system.
Using this model, they will explore how Ca waves are synchronized in the Purkinje fiber network leading to wave
break and reentry. This project is innovative because computational methods developed in this proposal will be
the first to address all the important scales in the problem and is significant because it will thus yield important
new insights into the underlying mechanism for CPVT."
10852733,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Seizures are a common, severe neurologic symptom of brain tumors with up to 80% of patients experiencing at
least one seizure. Recurrent seizures, termed brain-tumor-related epilepsy (BTRE), develop in half of brain tumor
patients and are often refractory to medical management. Poorly controlled epilepsy is the leading risk-factor for
long-term disability in brain tumor patients and complicates the course of treatment due to drug toxicities, loss of
driving privileges, and decreased quality of life. Further, an emerging body of work investigating neuronal
regulation of glioma growth suggests that epileptiform activity promotes tumor proliferation and invasion.
Successful intervention to stop seizures in patients would profoundly reduce neurologic morbidity and may halt
tumor progression. However, current first-line therapy for BTRE, the drug Leviteracetam, a synaptic release
inhibitor, fails to suppress seizures in half of patients. A fundamental shift in our approach to treatment of BTRE
is greatly needed.
 Recent studies on the pathogenesis of tumor-related epilepsy have uncovered novel roles for the brain
tumor microenvironment (TME), including tumor-stromal and tumor-neuron interactions that result in bi-
directional, synergistic efforts to re-sculpt the molecular structure of the TME, resulting in neuronal dysfunction
and a feed-forward loop of loss of inhibition, repeated seizures, and tumor progression. In particular, the
perineuronal net (PNN) has been shown to be degraded by gliomas, resulting in dysregulation of inhibitory
interneurons in the adjacent cortex. The TME is a novel and potentially powerful therapeutic target in BTRE;
however, the molecular and cellular mechanisms connecting tumor microenvironment to clinical seizures in
patients remain undefined.
 To better understand seizure onset in patients with brain tumors, this project will perform digital spatial
profiling (DSP), an automated system for multiplexed, spatially-linked RNA transcript and protein expression
quantification, and Visium 10x Single-nuclei RNA sequencing on brain tumor specimens to evaluate PNN
structure and composition in the TME. The project will then apply machine-learning approaches to analyze these
high-dimensional data in order to identify PNN features that relate to a clinical history of seizures. This aim will
test the hypothesis that tumor-related PNN degradation in patients is associated with severe neurologic
symptoms. It will also result in major development of novel histologic and computational techniques for evaluation
of PNN structure and function that can be broadly applied to other, similarly complex biomedical datasets.
 Completion of these aims will help the Project Leader and research team to better understand how brain
pathologies affect PNNs in patients, generate new biological resources and technologies for the study of human
PNNs, and provide evidence to support preserving or restoring the PNN as a novel, more effective strategy for
treatment of BTRE."
10852737,"Komor – Project Summary/Abstract – “Development and Application of New Genome Editing Tools for
the Functional Investigation of Genetic Variants of Uncertain Significance”
My research program aims to combat the variant interpretation problem that looms over the field of precision
medicine: out of 4.6 million missense variants identified in the Genome Aggregation Database, over half are
admitted to be variants of uncertain significance (VUS). New methods to enable the interpretation and functional
characterization of these VUS would not only enhance the efficacy of current therapies by better informing patient
selection strategies, but also accelerate the development of new approaches to combat diseases with a genetic
component. Targeted genome editing, the introduction of a specific modification in genomic DNA, has the
potential to allow researchers to study and better understand mechanisms of human genetic diseases, but
traditional genome editing methods (including CRISPR-Cas9) suffer from modest genome editing efficiencies as
well as unwanted gene alterations, particularly when attempting to introduce point mutations due to their reliance
on double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs). Recently, I developed a class of genome editing agents called base
editors that does not involve DSBs, but rather uses a catalytically inactive Cas9 tethered to a single-stranded
DNA modifying enzyme to directly chemically modify target nucleobases in genomic DNA. Two classes of editors
currently exist, which use cytosine and adenine deamination chemistries to catalyze the conversion of C•G base
pairs to T•A (CBEs), and A•T base pairs to G•C (ABEs), respectively. My research program involves both the
development of new base editor methodologies, as well as the utilization of currently available base editor tools
to functionally interrogate VUS. Direction 1 research aims to develop new base editors capable of facilitating
new point mutations using computationally-aided directed evolution. The resulting tools will be of broad interest
to the scientific community as they will enable researchers to cleanly and efficiently install additional types of
point mutations into the genome of living cells, enabling the study and potential treatment of human genetic
diseases. Direction 2 research endeavors to initiate the first investigation into the pathogenicity of co-occurring
VUS (i.e. when a given individual has two or more VUS in their genome) through the development of orthogonal
base editing. Bioinformatic analyses of ours suggest that the clinical interpretation of missense variants is being
convoluted by their frequent co-occurrence with other uninterpreted variants, and the development of orthogonal
base editing will allow us to functionally interrogate these co-occurring variants and assess their contribution to
human genetic diseases. Finally, Direction 3 research proposes the development of high-throughput base
editing, which will allow for the functional investigation of tens of thousands of SNVs at a time. While we currently
have the tools to begin work in all three areas, our research Directions are designed such that progress in any
one Direction can be integrated into the other Directions to exponentially advance the research. The successful
completion of the proposed work will prove transformative for deciphering disease mechanisms and result in the
development of more effective disease treatments."
10852981,"Latinos are expected to represent 21% of US adults over 65 years by 2060, up from 8% in 2015. Compared to
non-Latino whites, US Latinos have a higher prevalence and earlier onset of Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias (ADRDs) and face a higher burden of related risk factors (e.g. cardio-metabolic conditions). Life-
course circumstances including social adversity and environmental exposures may shape within-group
variation in ADRDs and related risk factors among US Latinos. Understanding the unique and combined
impacts of social and environmental factors on mid-life cognitive outcomes is critical for informing
early ADRDs prevention efforts; these exposures represent actionable targets for multi-level
interventions. Nevertheless, there is limited research on the impact of social adversity and pesticide exposure
on ADRDs risk, including among mid-life Latinos living in underserved agricultural areas with high pesticide
exposure. In particular, few studies have prospectively evaluated the impacts of social adversity, including
culturally-specific (e.g. migration-related) adversity on ADRDs among Latinos; most studies of pesticides and
ADRDs rely on crude exposure measures (e.g. recall of life-time occupation). We have a unique opportunity to
evaluate social and pesticide exposure in association with ADRDs risk factors among an ongoing cohort of
approximately 550 mid-life Latina women (average 47 years) living in an underserved agricultural region. The
Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS) study, initiated in 1998 as
an NIEHS/EPA Children’s Center, is a well-established longitudinal birth cohort of low-income, Mexican
American mother-child dyads living in a California agricultural community. Substantial information has been
collected on mothers’ early and mid-life social adversity, mid-life cardio-metabolic health, and pesticide
exposure captured via biomarkers and geographic information system-based residential proximity to pesticide
applications. We aim to add two mid-life cognitive assessments, additional social adversity and pesticide
exposure measures, and brain biomarker data collection (on a subset of 200). Informed by the life-course
perspective and the exposure-stress-disease framework, which posits that social and environmental exposures
may have unique and combined impacts on health, we propose to carry out the following Specific Aims: 1) To
quantify associations between early and mid-life social adversity on cognitive performance among mid-life
Latina women and the extent to which these associations are explained by cardio-metabolic and inflammatory
mechanisms, 2) To estimate associations between agricultural pesticide exposure and cognitive performance
and evaluate whether social adversity and pesticide exposure interact to produce poorer cognitive outcomes
among mid-life Latina women, and 3) To evaluate relationships between life-course social adversity, pesticide
exposure, and brain biomarkers among mid-life Latina women. Our overall goal is to inform early ADRDs
prevention efforts among US Latinos -- the most rapidly growing aging minority group in the US."

 Cancers of the Head and Neck
Project Summary/Abstract
 Approximately 65,000 cases of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer (HNSCC) are
diagnosed each year in the US and arise in the mucosal lining of the upper aerodigestive tract
and spread to local lymph nodes. In some cases, the primary tumor is too small to be detected,
with enlarged nodes being the only manifestation of HNSCC. These unknown primary cancers
(UPCs), often induced by human papilloma virus (HPV), usually arise in the mucosa of Waldeyer's
ring, the lymphatic tonsillar tissues of the pharynx. Finding UPC is significant and impactful
addressing an unmet need with long term oncologic and functional outcomes improved by locating
and removing UPC. However, their detection is impaired by the corrugated, cryptic surface, and
nodularity of lymphatic tissue which decreases the sensitivity of physical examination while the
vascularity and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity of the lymphoid tissue obscure small tumors by
computerized tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET).
 We have invented a library of ultra pH sensitive (UPS) nanoprobes, covalently conjugated to
indocyanine green (ICG) that respond to acidic tumor microenvironment, with a concomitant sharp
change in their fluorescence state from OFF to ON. One such nanoprobe, ONM-100, has been
developed and studied in a Phase 1 and ongoing FDA approved Phase 2 clinical trial. it has been
shown to be well tolerated with no serious adverse events, compatible with surgical endoscopes,
and able to detect a variety of cancers including HNSCC in real time. Based on these data we
hypothesize that ONM-100 used as an adjunct to SOC panendoscopy can improve detection of
UPC. To test our hypothesis, we will (1) Compare the sensitivity and specificity of activatable
probe ONM-100 for cancer detection to always ON probes for tumors in Waldeyer's ring; (2)
Detect HPV-mediated HNSCC in patients after systemic administration of ONM-100 comparing
fluorescence to true-positive cancers; (3) Detect UPC in patients after systemic administration of
ONM-100. Successful execution of this project will provide precise excision of UPC and avoidance
of intense adjuvant therapy for UPC patients significantly improving care and outcomes for these
patients who suffer greatly from less oncologically effective imprecise overtreatment."
10852467,"Upon infection, numerous cell types secrete anti-viral cytokines that induce an anti-viral state in neighboring
cells, which is critical for limiting infection. This proposal focuses on two opposing aspects of this anti-viral
state: one, cytokine-induced metabolic reprogramming, which we find is essential for the ability of cytokines to
limit viral infection; and two, the Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL26 protein, which we find is a major
antagonist of anti-viral gene expression. HCMV is a major cause of congenital birth defects and causes severe
disease in several immunosuppressed patient populations. Our results indicate that the anti-viral cytokine
TNFα induces glycolytic activation, which is essential for its anti-HCMV activity. However, the mechanisms
involved are not clear. We propose to identify the mechanisms through which anti-viral cytokines induce
metabolic remodeling (Aim 1), and determine how cytokine-induced metabolic activities limit HCMV infection
(Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how the HCMV UL26 protein blocks anti-viral responses, which we
hypothesize involves modulation of the activity of an intrinsic immune transcription factor complex (Aim 3). The
proposed research will identify novel cellular and viral mechanisms that govern the success of HCMV infection.
These mechanisms represent key determinants that could potentially be targeted to limit virally-associated
pathogenesis."

 Each year, BTP receives up to 100 applications from new TGE students that join our
mentor’s labs. This high level of interest reflects the visible, innovative and successful training
that BTP provides at UW-Madison. BTP requests support for 11 new trainees each year from
this large group of enthusiastic applicants and continued support for a 2nd year, accounting for
our request for a total of 22 NIGMS-funded trainees each year. BTP trainees will receive NIGMS
support during the 2nd and 3rd years of graduate school and participate in BTP program activities
during all years they are in graduate school. BTP trainees (with mentor guidance) will have
leading roles in organizing, teaching and presenting in a completely revamped BTP Seminar,
which provides the framework for our cross-disciplinary approach to integrative training in
rigorous, reproducible and responsible conduct of research. Trainees also complete courses in
responsible conduct of research in the 1st and 4th years, a required course in rigorous and
reproducible methods of research, and an innovative class in entrepreneurship that sets the
stage for internships. BTP trainees will complete internships and other career advancement
opportunities through a newly formed innovative connection to the biotechnology trade
advocacy group BioForward Wisconsin, its ~150 industry members and other sponsors.
 BTP is committed to tracking and analyzing the outcomes of its programs, trainees, mentors
and internship sponsors. We will use professionally designed and distributed anonymous
surveys, personal interviews, institutional data and social media to continue this effort and enlist
professionals from the UW-Madison Survey Center and LEAD to carry out independent
assessment and analysis to continually improve the impacts and outcomes of the BTP."
10854791,"Project Summary
 Cardiovascular catheterization is a minimally-invasive approach to measure hemodynamics and treat
abnormalities, such as vascular stenosis. Conventionally, X-ray fluoroscopy guides catheterizations, but it uses
ionizing radiation and suffers from poor soft tissue contrast even with the use of exogenous contrast agents.
This is problematic in children as they are particularly susceptible to radiation, often require repeat
assessments, and can have complex anatomy that is difficult to navigate. MRI guidance provides a non-
ionizing alternative that can improve soft tissue contrast and enhance evaluations. In addition to guiding
diagnostic catheterization, first-in-human studies 15 years ago demonstrated that MRI could guide cardiac
interventions such as coarctation angioplasty. However, clinical adoption since then has been limited by 1) few
MRI-safe interventional devices and 2) the relatively poor real-time MRI image quality available during
procedures. The number of MRI-safe devices is increasing, and low-field MRI has emerged as a new way to
significantly reduce device heating. Yet, poor real-time image quality remains a significant barrier. Despite
parallel imaging and accelerated image reconstructions, image quality is constrained by the limited set of MRI
samples available for image reconstruction in a single-shot, real-time acquisition.
 The solution: This proposal aims to leverage multi-beat information to improve real-time MRI image
quality during pediatric interventions. The goal is to improve image quality by increasing data available for
image reconstruction and improve device visualization by highlighting motion between beats. The central
hypothesis is that, in the interventional setting, multi-beat information will improve real-time MRI image quality
and device visualization, leading to improved operator confidence and performance. To test this hypothesis,
multi-beat’s impact on interventional image quality (Aim 1), impact on device visualization (Aim 2), and clinical
utility in pediatric patients (Aim 3) are evaluated. The proposal is supported by a team that includes pediatric
cardiologists at the forefront of MRI-guided interventions and prior research experience developing a closed-
loop MRI data collection technique which robustly identifies similar heartbeats. The platform was originally
designed for a different application – improving non-interventional MRI imaging of adults with arrythmia. Here,
it is adapted to explore a new imaging paradigm (interventional imaging) in a new patient population (pediatric
patients) for the PI. The work is expected to establish a new approach for real-time MRI-guided cardiovascular
interventions by addressing the areas that currently limit image guided confidence: poor anatomic and device
visualization. Success would not only improve MRI guidance of cardiovascular interventions in children but
also create new opportunities for MRI guidance of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular (biopsy, drainage,
thermal therapy) procedures for adults."

10854794,"Various nanoparticles (NPs) have been used for delivery of small antigens, which have limited viral mimic
features and are more efficacious than soluble antigens in stimulating B-cell immunity. However, these traditional
NPs lack characteristics of virus “spiky capsid protein peplomer”, e.g. spiky antigen clusters on the peplomers,
optimal distance between antigen clusters, and highly localized antigen density on the spike. It is unknown how
the lack of virus-like features of traditional NPs affect B cell immunity and durable antibody responses.
Although virus-like features of B cell vaccine for durable B cell immunity are clinically validated using virus-like
particles (VLPs) of viral capsid proteins, VLPs are not suitable for delivery of non-capsid small antigens (such as
bacterial toxins, small molecules, and oncogenic peptides) since these non-capsid small antigens are not able
to self-assemble to VLPs. There is a need to develop virus-like nanoparticles for small antigens to activate B cell
immunity against deadly bacterial toxins (Anthrax, Botulinum), small molecules, and oncogenic peptides.
Three components of B cell immunity are critical for durable antibody response: (A) Efficient antigen
delivery/retention and unique antigen distribution patterns for B cell acquisition in the draining lymph nodes
(dLNs), (B) Activation of antigen-specific B cells through multivalent binding/crosslink with B cell receptor (BCR),
(C) Activation of follicular T Helper cells (Tfh) that support Germinal Center (GC) B cells and their differentiation
to long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs). However, it is unknown how the lack of virus-like features of NPs antigen
delivery systems affect these three critical components of B cell immunity for durable antibody response.
In this proposal, we will generate inorganic virus like nanoparticles (IVLNs) with three features of spiky peplomers
of virus' using four types of small antigens (peptides of anthrax and botulinum toxins, small molecule 4-hydroxy-
3-nitrophenyl acetyl-hapten, HER2 peptides) to test our hypothesis. We hypothesize that: (A) Virus-like features
of IVLNs enhance efficient delivery/retention with unique antigen distribution patterns for B cell acquisition in the
lymph node, (B) Virus-like features of IVLNs enhance B cell activation via multivalent bind/crosslink with B cell
receptor, promote follicular T (Tfh) cell-dependent B-cell activation, enhance formation of long-lived plasma cells
(LLPCs) in the Germinal Center (GC), and generate antibodies with high specificity/affinity, (C) Virus-like features
of IVLNs induce durable antibody response against bacterial toxins (anthrax and botulinum) and oncogenic
antigens.
Aim 1 Determine virus-like features of IVLNs to improve antigen delivery/retention with unique antigen
distribution patterns for B cell acquisition in the lymph nodes vs. traditional NPs
Aim 2 Identify the stages of B cell responses by the virus-like features of IVLNs vs. traditional NPs
Aim 3 Investigate IVLNs-antigen immunizations to induce more durable antibody response against Anthrax and
Botulinum toxins and oncogenic HER2 in animals vs. traditional NPs"

multidisciplinary predoctoral training program that uses a systems approach to provide comprehensive,
biomedical graduate education to our trainees. The CSIP program is designed around evidence-based training
activities, including didactic coursework, seminar courses focusing on scientific communication and grant-writing,
career building activities, and novel doctoral research. Our rationale is that by combining these training
approaches, the UNC CSIP Training Program will produce a diverse pool of well-trained scientists and leaders
with the skills necessary to transition into successful careers in the biomedical research workforce.
The multidisciplinary and interdepartmental CSIP Training Program draws its mentoring faculty and leadership
members from 8 basic science departments (Biochemistry and Biophysics, Biology, Biomedical Engineering,
Cell Biology and Physiology, Genetics, Microbiology and Immunology, Pathology, and Pharmacology) and 7
clinical departments (Medicine, Neurology, Nutrition, Oral and Craniofacial Health Sciences, Pediatrics,
Psychiatry, and Surgery) that span the UNC School of Medicine, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the
School of Public Health. The CSIP Training Program will transcend these individual departments to provide
hands-on training and mentorship from our collaborative faculty and extracurricular, structured training
opportunities across the CSIP departments. Our distinguished faculty emphasize rigor, transparency, integrity,
and creative scientific reasoning that provide a broad, integrated biological foundation centered on organ
systems and human diseases and have the vast resources of UNC at their disposal. By going beyond the
minimum requirements of the Ph.D. granting departments and curriculums, the CSIP Training Program will serve
as a model for graduate student training and education.
In support of the CSIP Training Program, we request 5 years of funding to train predoctoral students for 2
years in the cellular and physiological processes of higher organisms across various scales (from molecular to
whole-organism) and provide meaningful career development activities designed to prepare a diverse student
population for a variety of biomedical career paths. The University of North Carolina is a national leader in
developed programs to support ethnic, cultural, and physical diversity and the CSIP Training Program will strive

10854895,"Project Summary/Abstract
Rho family small GTPases are key regulators of activities such as cell migration, gene transcription, growth, and
survival, processes initiated by signaling through diverse sets of molecules including cytokines, growth factors,
and GPCRs. Dbl family Rho guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs), including around 70 members,
are critical activators of signaling by GTPases such as Rac, Cdc42, and Rho. RhoGEFs are multi-domain
proteins that frequently function as signaling scaffolds at cell membranes and play roles in regulating other
signaling pathways, a feature conferred by their complex architecture and the fact that each member has a
unique domain composition. As major players in processes underlying cell migration and division, several
RhoGEFs are strongly implicated in cancer. Despite their clinical importance, these proteins are vastly
understudied at the molecular level from a whole-molecule, mechanistic perspective, and there are no
therapeutic inhibitors that target these enzymes. Our laboratory is pioneering the study of full-length RhoGEFs
and mechanisms in their regulation at lipid membranes, using cryo-EM as a major approach. Our long-term goal
is to understand the complex, multi-component mechanisms behind Dbl RhoGEF signaling and regulation.
Within this family, the phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3)-dependent Rac exchanger (P-Rex)
subfamily, including P-Rex1 and P-Rex2, act as important regulators of cell migration. Both isoforms have been
associated with human cancers, wherein they act as pro-metastatic factors. P-Rex2 is commonly mutated in
breast cancer and melanoma, with mutations distributed throughout the protein. One study identified it as one of
the most mutated genes in human metastatic melanomas. Altogether, data support that P-Rex is an important
signaling molecule implicated in disease and a suitable therapeutic target. However, even though P-Rex was
discovered over 15 years ago, the molecular details of its regulatory mechanisms are still not fully understood.
P-Rex proteins are hypothesized to be autoinhibited in their inactive, non-signaling states and activated in multi-
step mechanisms. They are activated by binding membrane-tethered G protein b and g subunits, downstream of
GPCR signaling, and by binding cell membrane lipids, including the lipid PIP3. Additionally, P-Rex acts as a
signaling scaffold in various cellular contexts by binding to signaling proteins like PKA and PTEN, resulting in
changes in activities of P-Rex and the binding partner. Our long-term goal is to understand how different
RhoGEFs transition between the basal and fully active states and how this transition is regulated, starting with
the P-Rex subfamily. Furthermore, we will determine how these proteins act as signaling scaffolds at the cell
membrane. Using nanodiscs, we will study the multi-valent interactions of RhoGEFs with lipids and regulatory
molecules, giving us unprecedented insight into these signaling complexes. Mechanistic hypotheses will be
tested in vitro and in cancer cell lines. Once important regulatory surfaces are identified, we will target these via
rational design of therapeutic molecules."

This project will launch a Florida wide effort to promote the delivery of developmentally sensitive, culturally
appropriate and evidence-based DIAGNOSE and PREVENT counseling testing and referral services (CTR) for
young men who have sex with men (YMSM). The goal is to leverage implementation science strategies to
improve the capacity of the HIV HealthForce to deliver evidence-based practices (risk reduction counseling,
PrEP referral and Tailored Motivational Interviewing) within CTR services. Our recent YMSM Mystery
Shoppers studies conducted at CTR sites in three cities indicated that providers are woefully unprepared or do
not know how to deliver developmentally appropriate, culturally competent CTR services to YMSM and miss
opportunities to deliver these evidence-based practices. Mystery Shopper is a quality management strategy to
monitor implementation fidelity to culturally and developmentally responsive EBPs in CTR settings. However,
assessment and feedback alone are insufficient to improve fidelity; the HealthForce must be properly trained
and given technical assistance. We propose integrating two implementation strategies: quality management
Mystery Shoppers and HealthForce training in Tailored Motivational Interviewing with centralized technical
assistance. We will test Young Adult Centered HealthForce Training (YACHT) package in Florida’s seven EHE
counties among the Department of Health’s 42 contracted sites who delivered CTR to at least 24 young MSM
in the previous 12 months using a Stepped Wedge design. We power on both effectiveness outcomes (# of
tests of YMSM) and implementation outcomes (EBP fidelity based on Mystery Shopper Assessments)

10840992,"Mycobacteria are a genus of the phylum Actinobacteria that includes the human pathogens M.
tuberculosis and M. leprae and their avirulent relative M. smegmatis. Human infections with M.
tuberculosis (the agent of tuberculosis) and M. leprae (agent of leprosy) cause substantial human
suffering. Tuberculosis accounts for ~2 million deaths annually. M. tuberculosis is increasingly
antibiotic resistant, solely through the acquisition of mutations in chromosomal genes. The
importance of mutagenesis in the evolution of M. tuberculosis antimicrobial resistance, and the
related importance of DNA repair pathways in resisting host-inflicted DNA damage, prompts our
interest in the mechanisms by which mycobacteria respond to and repair DNA damage. In
addition to this important relevance to human health, mycobacteria have emerged as fertile model
system to study prokaryotic DNA repair, due to the complexity of the pathways involved and the
novel mechanisms that govern these pathways. Our long range goals in this project are to
elucidate the DNA repair mechanisms of Mycobacteria. Our work supported by this award has
shown that mycobacterial DNA repair differs from the classic E. coli model system with respect to
the number of pathway options for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), the roster of
DNA repair enzymes, and the regulation of the DNA damage response (DDR). Our premise is
that understanding the distinctive features of mycobacterial DNA repair will illuminate the
evolution and diversification of repair strategies and suggest new approaches to combat
mycobacterial infection and emergence of antibiotic resistance. Our agenda for the next phase of
the project focuses on three themes in mycobacterial DNA repair: (i) the mechanism of DSB
resection during homologous recombination (HR) by the AdnAB helicase-nuclease; (ii) the role of
RecA phosphorylation and RecA interaction with membrane phospholipids in controlling the DNA
damage response; and (iii) the structure and repair activities of the DNA helicase Lhr. We propose
a combined approach that leverages integrated biochemical, structural, and genetic approaches
to understand these DNA repair systems of mycobacteria. Through these studies we will elucidate
new mechanisms of DNA repair in mycobacteria, discoveries that will both advance basic
knowledge of prokaryotic DNA repair and elucidate pathways relevant to M. tuberculosis drug
resistance and pathogenesis."
10841022,"Compatibility Between Brain-Computer Interface and
 High Efficiency Augmentative and Alternative Communication Systems: Commercial Readiness
 Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable text production for people who cannot move but include only simple
communication interfaces and are not widely used. Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems
are widely used and give efficient and precise communication, but require movement, preventing use by people
with severe impairments, such as advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or severe cerebral palsy. Phase I and
Phase II STTR efforts created a prototype commercial-grade AAC-BCI peripheral for the Prentke Romich
Company’s (PRC’s) extensive language application and communication system product line.
 In accordance with PAR-20-130, the SBIR/STTR Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) Program for
Technical Assistance and Late Stage Development, the overall objective of this application is to complete late-
stage development of the AAC-BCI, optimize the design for long-term use by target users, finalize regulatory
and reimbursement pathways, evaluate train-the-trainer resources, and conduct a small clinical trial of in-home
product use to plan future, larger clinical trials. This object will be accomplished by the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Optimize the AAC-BCI design with regard to long-term use with target user populations.
 Iterative cycles of laboratory testing and software development will optimize the AAC-BCI. Optimization will
include an automatic standby mode which the user can independently exit when communication is desired.
Aim 2: Optimize AAC-BCI design for regulatory and reimbursement considerations.
 Risk Analysis, laboratory testing, iterative engineering refinements and documentation will ensure that the
AAC-BCI qualifies for medical device reimbursement by the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS),
meets FDA Class II (Exempt) Medical Device requirements, and meets corresponding international regulations.
Aim 3: Evaluate dosage and delivery of AAC-BCI training resources to achieve practitioner
competence for clinical services.
 AAC-BCI users, support persons and interprofessional practitioners will evaluate training and support
resources. PRC consultants and clinicians will participant in trainings that vary in dosage and types, evaluate
their experience and satisfaction, and complete a competency task checklist, brief interview, and online survey.
Aim 4: Clinical trial of in-home AAC-BCI use by people with specific target user characteristics.
 PRC consultants and clinicians from Aim 3 trainings will identify potential AAC-BCI users and support people,
train them on in-home AAC-BCI set-up and communication and follow monthly to track use and satisfaction.
 The innovation of this work is merging BCI access into PRC’s high-efficiency AAC language production
designs that match individual ability, need, and preference. The significance is the extension of quality-of-life
communication with CMS reimbursement approval to those with the most severe physical impairments, providing
an AAC-BCI from an established company with a clinical support network to provide services across the lifespan."
10841024,"Project Summary/Abstract: Contribution of somatic mitochondrial DNA mutation to the transition from
normal aging to Alzheimer’s disease.
Candidate and Training: Dr. Sanchez-Contreras is an MD, PhD, Acting Instructor in the Department of
Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Washington (UW). Her research is directed towards
understanding the effects that somatic mutations of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have on mitochondrial
function during aging, and further differentiate these from pathogenic mtDNA mutations that cause
mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). To develop her area of research, Dr. Sanchez-
Contreras will apply her expertise in duplex sequencing and in neurodegeneration, while she will acquire skills
in procedures to measure mitochondrial physiology and data analysis. This training will be focused on the
underlying mitochondrial biology of aging guided by four mentors that are experts in mitochondrial genetics and
biology, neuropathology and in vivo models of aging and AD and immersed in a research group that is a leader
in aging and in AD research in the country.
Research: Somatic mutations of the mtDNA and mitochondrial dysfunction are found in the brain of AD
patients. As these findings also accompany normal aging, it is unclear what determines the departure from
normal to pathogenic in AD. The main hypothesis of this study is that somatic mtDNA mutations abnormally
increase at preclinical and early stages of AD, and that they contribute to mitochondrial and synaptic
dysfunction, and the worsening of AD pathology. This hypothesis will be tested in two aims. In Aim 1, pre-
clinical AD patients will be studied to find somatic mutations and mitochondrial and synaptic abnormalities that
associate with AD pathology. In Aim 2, a systematic evaluation of somatic mtDNA mutation and mitochondrial
function will be performed in the mouse brain by increasing somatic mutagenesis at multiple ages using the
mutator mito-APOBEC1 transgene. Lastly, the impact of somatic mutation in AD will be studied in two models
of the main neuropathological components: amyloid pathology and tauopathy. These two approaches will
contribute to understanding of how the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus respond to increasing somatic
mutations and mito-dysfunction early in the progression of AD.
Career Development Plan: The execution of this K01 award is designed to ensure Dr. Sanchez-Contreras’
successful transition to an independent faculty position in her department. To this aim, a structured plan is
presented that includes the commitment of her institution and her department to support her efforts, a strong
mentorship committee, the consolidation of strategic collaborations and the performance of crucial
experimental protocols that will result in significant advancements in the field of aging and that will be the
foundation for R21 and R01 submissions at the conclusion of this K01."
10841026,"Currently, approximately 5.8 million Americans have Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) and
are cared for by 16 million family members, friends or other unpaid caregivers. Communication deficits are
common among persons with ADRD and are due to a variety of symptoms associated with ADRD, including
(but not limited to) various types of primary progressive aphasia, memory loss, word-retrieval anomia, and
decreased attention span. For the persons with ADRD, these deficits can lead to a number of poor outcomes,
such as depression, social isolation, mood and behavioral disturbances, and premature institutionalization.
Communication deficits also pose challenges to caregiving and clinical care, which is already complex. Our
team has previously developed and tested an information technology (IT) intervention, called CareHeroes (CH)
app that assists caregivers with common caregiving challenges and to improve clinical communication
between ADRD caregivers and providers. The team has successfully integrated CH into clinical care at two
memory clinics and have translated CH into Spanish. The proposed project builds on this previous work by
modifying CH to include an Assistive Alternative Communication (AAC) device that relies on touchscreen
technology to increase communication by the persons with ADRD about their daily care preferences,
experiences, and habits. This new interface is customizable and grounded in evidence on AAC and
touchscreen-use by persons with dementia. Essentially, the CH AAC would compensate for the persons’
communication deficits by using photographs, graphics and text to promote engagement of the person with
ADRD, promote personhood, and offer providers access to real-time, tracked behavioral trends that support
early detection, intervention, and monitoring of community dwelling older adults. The study has two Specific
Aims: (1) Develop a novel, electronic AAC interface for an existing IT intervention (CH) that assists the person
with dementia in communicating their daily care preferences with caregivers; and communicate everyday
habits and behaviors (e.g., sleep quality, appetite, daily activities) with providers involved in their care; (2)
Examine the impact and conduct a pilot study that evaluates biopsychosocial outcomes of 120 triads (person
with dementia/ caregivers/providers) utilizing the CH3.0 intervention as an adjunct to care and caregiving for 12
months. Triads will be recruited from two memory clinics (Miami, Alabama) where we have already integrated
the current version of CH into care for use by caregivers and providers. These clinics serve several
disadvantaged ADRD populations (e.g., African American, Hispanic, rural-dwelling). Measures will be
administered at baseline, 6 month, and 12 months and focus on psychosocial and communication/engagement
among members of the triad and we will track all CH3.0 user actions for the 12 month study. The project
design is highly feasible and cost efficient, given that the infrastructure has already been established through
the team’s currently funded (AHRQ R21 HS026571- 9/18- 09/20) study."

10841354,"Candidate’s Project Abstract:
Biological phase separation phenomena contribute to many fundamental cellular organization and regulatory
processes, from transcription to post-transcriptional gene regulation, and have recently been identified as a
pathophysiological hallmark of two prominent neurodegenerative diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Stress granules (SGs), macromolecular complexes of RNAs and RNA
binding proteins (RBPs) that assemble in response to stress-elicited inactivation of translation initiation, are an
actively studied example of a regulatory biological phase separation process and a prominent experimental
model in the field. Despite the well-established finding that SG biogenesis is a ubiquitous cellular response to
stress-induced translational suppression, there remain substantial gaps in our understanding of SG biogenesis.
Among the most significant gaps is an understanding of the biological criteria for mRNA recruitment into SGs.
Transcriptome analyses of isolated SGs have provided limited insights into SG recruitment criteria, revealing a
positive correlation with CDS and UTR length and a negative correlation with translational efficiencies. An
additional and unexpected finding from SG transcriptome analyses was that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-
targeted mRNAs are substantially under-represented in SG mRNA transcriptomes. This finding is all the more
unexpected in light of recent finding that ER dynamics are functionally coupled to SG biogenesis and regulate
granule biogenesis and fusion. How the ER contributes to SG biogenesis while its associated mRNAs are largely
sequestered from these regulatory organelles is unknown. An additional important and as yet unexplained
observation is that on average, only a small fraction (< 10%) of a given mRNA is recruited into SGs. It is not
currently known if this fraction comprises a random, stochastic sampling of the cellular mRNA population or,
alternatively, a distinguishable cohort of mRNAs. Addressing these gaps in knowledge will be accelerated by
experimental models that enable molecular dissection of these questions. To this end, we recently discovered
that SGs assemble on the ER in response to activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and, critically,
that mRNA recruitment into ER-associated SGs is gene-selective. Intriguingly, we also discovered that SG
biogenesis is intimately linked to, and dependent upon, de novo transcription. These findings are significant
because they suggest that SG biogenesis is restricted to newly exported mRNAs, is spatially organized on the
ER membrane, and reveal divergent fates for mature vs. newly exported mRNAs during the cellular response to
stress. By identifying molecular signals for the recruitment of mRNAs into SGs and determining how transcription
and SG biogenesis are coupled, we expect that the candidate’s research will advance understanding of stress
granule biology and its regulatory roles in post-transcriptional gene expression."

The burden of digestive and liver diseases is considerable. To reduce that burden, the primary mission of the
Digestive Disease Epidemiology Training Program at the University of North Carolina is to train independent
researchers who will improve our understanding of the magnitude, etiology, impact, and treatment of digestive
and liver diseases, and who will assume leadership roles in GI epidemiology and outcomes research. To
accomplish that mission, the program includes the following aims: 1) provide formal advanced training in
epidemiologic methods and biostatistics leading to an MSCR or PhD in epidemiology; 2) emphasize the
design, execution, analysis and publication of a research project; 3) assign mentors with expertise in clinical
epidemiology and gastroenterology to guide the developing investigator; 4) deliver an integrative core
curriculum designed to acquire professional skills necessary for an academic career; 5) concurrently train 3
MD’s and 2 PhD candidates. Postdoctoral applicants are specifically recruited and matched to this high impact
training program. The postdoctoral trainees spend four years in fellowship including two years in dedicated
research training and two years in clinical training. Predoctoral trainees spend 2 to 4 years leading to a PhD in
epidemiology. The program takes advantage of unique and considerable institutional strengths in public health
and gastroenterology, and a strong institutional commitment. Highly collaborative faculty mentors provide
expert guidance. A core curriculum leads to competencies in: clinical research study design, fundamentals of
data analysis, grant proposal development, interdisciplinary collaboration, project oversight and management,
oral and written presentation, and professional development. The training faculty includes 14 seasoned
investigators from adult or pediatric GI and the Department of Epidemiology and 4 early stage investigators
who serve as junior training faculty. Trainee progress is monitored by mentors, a Training Advisory Committee
and the program director. Trainees provide anonymous feedback about the program leading to continuous
improvement. The program has a strong record of training academic leaders. Trainees in this program obtain
exceptional records of publication, outstanding methodologic skills, and extensive practical research
experience to equip them for faculty positions on completion of the fellowship."

The ability to systematically construct highly functionalized molecules in a general and reliable manner
is central to synthetic organic chemistry and key for drug discovery, development, and scale-up in both
academia and, in particular, the pharmaceutical industry. Our proposed work includes palladium-
catalyzed cross coupling methods for the formation of aromatic and heterocyclic carbon-nitrogen bonds,
carbon-oxygen bonds and carbon-fluorine bonds. One aspect of the chemistry that we are proposing
involves the design of improved ligands and methods for aromatic carbon-heteroatom bond formation.
Our work in this area is used throughout academia and industry for the preparation of complex molecules
and has become mainstay processes for synthetic chemists. As part of this, we have developed
numerous new ligands and catalysts that are now commercially available and widely employed. The
invention of new, more general, and more user-friendly techniques will not only allow access to important
compounds but also the means to be able to efficiently and selectively modify them. This allows chemists
to rationally make new derivatives, with decreased side effects and better properties. We are also working
on copper-catalyzed methods for the highly regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselective synthesis of aliphatic
amines, copper-catalyzed methods for the asymmetric formation of carbon-carbon bonds and dual
copper- and palladium-catalyzed processes. A portion of this work aims to design new more
economically, environmentally, and generally applicable methods for the formation of carbon-carbon
bonds by using alkenes as pronucleophiles. We wish to develop chemistry that will allow us to replace
standard, highly reactive reactants with more benign and useful ones. We will also carry out mechanistic
studies to help understand the fundamental features of these transformations and to help guide us in
advancing the efficiency and utility of this work. The substrates we are targeting are representative of
common structural components found in pharmaceuticals, natural products, agrochemicals, and sensory
materials. The availability of these new technologies will allow others to prepare a variety of highly-
functionalized and structurally diverse compounds, many of which have previously been inaccessible,
which will have a great impact in a range of areas that are directly important to human health."

This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is designed to provide the applicant
with the advanced training necessary to establish an independent program of research in the epidemiology of
overdose mortality and suicide. A comprehensive training program is proposed, combining formal coursework,
mentoring, and hands-on training experiences designed to develop expertise in data linkage/ harmonization,
latent class modeling (LCA), qualitative psychological autopsy (PA) and mixed methods research.
As overdose deaths increase, they continue to be treated as accidents resulting from changes in opioid use.
However, epidemiologic research suggests that many of these deaths are likely suicides, This has important
implications for appropriately targeting interventions. We will measure the magnitude of this misclassification of
manner of death (MOD; intentionality) and identify factors that may guide medical examiners to more
accurately classify suicide decedents. We hypothesize that approximately one third of opioid related deaths of
undetermined manner are truly suicides, and that LCA can distinguish subgroups of decedents with greater
likelihood of suicidal intent. We will use PA in a subset of previously undetermined intent decedents to test
predictive ability of empirically-derived classes and characterize the diverse paths to overdose.
We propose to analyze all opioid overdose deaths in Maryland from 2006-2019 (n=13,861) using demographic,
social, and clinical data which we will link from the Maryland Suicide Data Warehouse to mortality data from
the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME). First, taking one third of this sample, we will compare cases
classified as suicidal (n=115) from accidental (n=756) and undetermined intent (n=3,748) using a three-way
multinomial logistic regression. Next, variables found to be most salient comparators will be used in LCA of the
remaining cases, agnostic of OCME MOD class (n=9,286). Comparing the empirically derived classes with the
OCME designations, we will assess the proportion of designated suicides and accidents in each class. Finally,
from each of these latent classes, we will select 40 decedents designated by OCME as ‘undetermined manner’
to be further examined by multiple collateral interview PA, to corroborate these latent classes. By generalizing
findings from LCA and PA, more accurate suicide rate estimates can be made. Findings would impact future
MOD designation and potentially, how prevention interventions target accidental overdoses and suicides.
Training and mentorship plans will leave the candidate well positioned to become an independent physician-
epidemiologist, able to utilize both qualitative and quantitative methods for the validation of large linked data
sets describing the interrelated suicide and overdose crises. His long term career goals include the elucidation
of mechanisms of self injury mortality, the use of mixed methods for the generation and investigation of novel
hypotheses regarding pathways to suicide, and the ability to translate these findings into suicide prevention."
10840081,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Trauma claims for 8% of deaths and 16% of disabilities worldwide. Despite significant improvement in the trauma
clinical care, overall mortality remains high largely due to trauma-associated organ injury and secondary infection.
Hence, understanding the molecular and cellular mechanism responsible for trauma-associated organ injury and
developing novel therapeutic strategies to preserve organ functions will advance the field of trauma care.
Traumatic injury leads to a massive activation of the innate immunity likely driven by danger-associated
molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as extracellular (ex) nucleic acids, that are released from necrotic or injured
cells. DAMP-induced innate immune activation may lead to tissue inflammation and organ injury. Our preliminary
data demonstrate that 1) circulating exRNAs are significantly increased in both trauma patients and mice, and
capable of activating macrophages (M) with robust cytokine/chemokine productions in trauma; 2) small RNA-
seq profiling reveals that miRNAs constitute 80% of plasma exRNAs and their expressions are markedly altered
following non-hemorrhagic blunt trauma in humans and mice; 3) genetic deficiency of TLR7, the single-stranded
RNA sensor, significantly attenuates trauma plasma exRNA-induced cytokine productions in M and
circulating/tissue inflammation after trauma. Based on literature and the preliminary data, we hypothesize that
exRNAs function as a molecular driver that activates the innate immunity by regulating M functions and is
partially responsible for trauma-induced inflammation and organ injury. To test the hypothesis, this renewed R35
research program will address the following specific questions: 1) What is the precise role and mechanism of
exRNAs in innate immune inflammation and remote organ injury after trauma and 2) Could we target exRNA-
TLR7 signaling to mitigate trauma-induced organ injury? We will employ multiple complementary approaches –
genetically modified animals, adoptive cell transfer and chimeric models, synthetic oligo nucleic acids,
pharmacological inhibitors and receptor antagonist, locked nucleic acids-modified anti-miRNA inhibitors – to
provide novel insight into how exRNAs regulate host innate immunity and contributes to organ injury after trauma.
Successful completion of this research program will lay the foundation for future ex-miRNA-based intervention
in trauma care."
10840937,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Under stress conditions, the cells needs to rapidly respond to environmental clues to adapt the gene
expression landscape. One particular aspect of the gene expression cascade that is emerging as a prime
source for this rapid change is the manipulation of RNA turnover. Yet, what dictates RNA decay or stability in a
time-sensitive and fast manner is not fully understood. In the recent years, post-transcriptional modifications
have emerged as potent and dynamic regulator of a range of RNA functions including RNA stability. However,
little is known about the regulation of post-transcriptional modifications in stress conditions or in response to
rapid changes in gene expression. This proposal focuses on the post-transcriptional RNA modification N6-
methyladenosine (m6A) and aims to determine how m6A status may control RNA fate in the face of
widespread RNA decay. Our central hypothesis is that this modification helps discriminate mRNAs that are
targeted for fast degradation from those that are spared. To test this hypothesis, we are using a powerful tool
as we are taking advantage of a very potent viral nuclease. This endonuclease comes from the KSHV virus
(Kaposi's Sarcoma Associated Herpesvirus) and has the ability, by itself, to trigger up to 80% of total mRNA
degradation in mammalian cells. However, to date, it is unclear what renders an mRNA susceptible or resistant
to this pervasive nuclease. In this proposal, we will use this viral system to query the host transcriptome
response to this massive RNA decay event. We will combine RNA-seq and m6A-RIP seq strategies to assess
how diverse the m6A landscape is among degraded or spared mRNAs. We will then monitor how the m6A
machinery responds and/or is affected this re-structuring of the RNA steady state in the cell. In particular, our
emphasis will be on the m6A readers that may directly be involved in decoding the m6A marks on the stable
mRNAs. Finally, because RNA decay under stress conditions and/or in response to external stimuli is an
heterogenous process, we will expand our exploration of m6A regulation of RNA stability to other sources of
RNA degradation beyond viral nucleases using a novel site directed CRISPR Cas system. Taken together, we
anticipate that these studies will shed light on a novel type of sensing mechanism that adapts the host cell
environment to large changes in RNA stability. Since the regulation of RNA turnover is at the core many
processes in the cell, understanding how post-transcriptional modifications may contribute to this complex
balance should reveal novel pathways both in pathogenic and normal cells."
10840945,"Project Summary
 Nucleotide repeat elements, including microsatellites or short tandem repeats, are
common in eukaryotic genomes. Expansions of short nucleotide repeats have been linked to
over 50 different types of genetic disorders, primarily neurological and neuromuscular disorders.
Our understanding of how these repeat elements in the human genome cause diseases is still
in its infancy. A hexanucleotide repeat expansion in a noncoding region of the C9orf72 gene has
been linked to the neurodegenerative diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and
frontotemporal dementia (FTD). ALS is characterized by loss of motor neurons, and the C9orf72
hexanucleotide repeat expansion represents the most common genetic cause of both familial
and sporadic ALS. FTD is characterized by degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes of the
brain and is the second-most common type of dementia in people older than 65; the C9orf72
hexanucleotide repeat expansion is also the most common genetic cause of FTD. This repeat
expansion is also found to contribute to Alzheimer’s disease and Huntington’s disease. To help
relieve the public health burden associated with these diseases, it is important to understand the
mechanisms underlying their pathogenesis. Multiple hypotheses exist to explain the pathogenic
mechanisms underlying C9orf72-linked ALS/FTD. The goal of the proposed project is to
elucidate novel mechanisms through which the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion leads
to molecular defects and neuronal toxicity, focusing on gain-of-function mechanisms. The
specific aims are to identify previously unknown pathogenic cascades initiated by the C9orf72
hexanucleotide repeat expansion. These novel pathogenic cascades include, but are not limited
to, RNA toxicity and non-canonical translation products resulting from the C9orf72
hexanucleotide repeat expansion. We propose a series of fundamental studies that combine
biochemical, molecular, and genetic approaches to shed light on the novel pathways leading to
ALS/FTD pathogenesis and to identify potential intervention strategies. Successful completion
of the project is expected to provide insights into fundamental mechanisms of
neurodegeneration in ALS/FTD that may ultimately lead to novel approaches for treating
ALS/FTD and other relevant neurodegenerative diseases."
10840981,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this proposal is to determine whether molecularly distinct progenitor cells give rise to local
astrocyte diversity. Astrocytes are estimated to comprise up to 40% of cells in the brain and growing
evidence now shows that these cells possess diverse phenotypic and molecular characteristics.
Nevertheless, large gaps remain in our understanding of how such distinct characteristics arise. This study
focuses on the role of the molecular signaling pathway, Sonic hedgehog (Shh), which distinguishes a
population of perinatal glial progenitor cells in the forebrain. Fate mapping experiments show that these
progenitors generate half the population of cortical astrocytes, suggesting that the cortex harbors astrocytes
from multiple lineages. The precise role of Shh signaling in astrocyte development is not well understood.
This study applies molecular genetic tools together with high resolution imaging and 3D reconstruction of
single cells, together with RNASeq and bioinformatic analysis to address the role of Shh signaling in
defining lineage-specific phenotypic and molecular characteristics of astrocytes. We will first identify the
progenitor cell responsible for Shh-mediated astrocyte production and define unique characteristics of cells
within this lineage. We will then apply loss of function strategies together with RNASeq and bioinformatic
analysis to interrogate the role of Shh signaling in astrocyte development and molecular identity. Finally, we
will use a cellular ablation approach to determine the functional significance of cells derived from the Shh
lineage. This study will advance our understanding of astrocyte diversity in the brain and illuminate novel
roles for Shh signaling in cell and brain development."
10843081,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of why only certain vaccines promote formation of long-lasting
and protective antibody responses. Dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen presenting cells that regulate
adaptive immune responses; thus, we think that understanding the role DCs in regulating B cell responses will
be key to the development of universal vaccines targeting influenza and HIV. Our experimental data suggest
that the major limitations of the relatively ineffective vaccines currently in use or in development might be that:
1) they do not specifically target Langerhans cells (LCs) and 2) the antigen dose is not tailored to maximize the
activation of the LCs. Our long-term goal is to understand the role of different DC populations in humoral immune
responses and to use that knowledge to design DC-subset-tailored vaccines, with a special focus on influenza
and HIV. In pursuit of that goal, the objectives of this application are to: 1) define the mechanisms by which
steady state LCs promote germinal center (GC)-dependent humoral immune responses; 2) to characterize the
regulatory loop by which high antigen dose and CD103+ DCs inhibit GC-dependent responses induced by LCs;
and 3) to test the feasibility of the DC-subset-tailored influenza vaccine. Our central hypothesis is that LCs drive
functionally distinct Tfh cells in an antigen dose-dependent manner that ultimately determines whether humoral
immune responses are mounted or not. The rationale for the proposed research is that, once the details of how
LCs initiate humoral immune responses and regulate each other are known, the process can likely be
manipulated to yield innovative approaches for prevention and treatment of a variety of diseases. Guided by
strong preliminary data, our hypothesis will be tested in these three Specific Aims: 1. Define the mechanism by
which LCs promote GC-dependent humoral immune responses; 2) Determine the mechanism by which high
antigen dose and CD103+ DCs inhibit LC-induced GC-dependent humoral immune responses; and 3) Determine
the effect of antigen dose on development of protective anti-viral responses. For Aim 1, a well characterized
targeting approach will be combined with LC-specific knock out transgenic mouse models, bone marrow
chimeras, imaging, in vitro cell cultures and flow cytometry to define the molecular requirements of LC-induced
humoral immune responses. In Aim 2, in vitro co-culture experiments and in vivo adoptive cell transfer systems
will be used to characterize how high antigen dose and CD103+ DCs regulate LC-induced immune responses.
In Aim 3, we will immunize mice through LCs with different doses of flu-HA and then challenge with live influenza
to determine the feasibility of the antigen-tailored influenza vaccine. The proposed hypothesis and experimental
models are highly novel and innovative. This project is significant because it will advance and expand our
understanding on how humoral immune responses are induced and regulated by DC subsets, which we expect
will overcome problems that have hindered our ability to generate effective influenza vaccines."
10843088,"Complement inhibitors are receiving significant interest currently towards inflammatory diseases such as
rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, primarily in the form of monoclonal antibodies against
the terminal products of complement activation most responsible for harmful inflammation. However,
monoclonal antibody therapeutics are largely falling short of providing a broadly useful tool for inflammatory
disease because they are rapidly cleared, have variable efficacy in broad patient populations, are
expensive, and require regular infusions to maintain therapeutic concentrations. Cyclical dosing further
induces the formation of anti-drug antibodies, and monoclonal antibody therapeutics miss the opportunity
to controllably engage multiple complement components simultaneously to specifically reduce harmful
inflammation. Owing to these challenges, complement inhibitors have only been approved for a limited
number or complement-mediated disorders, and there remains a critical need for technologies that can
selectively and stably neutralize multiple precisely targeted complement proteins for the treatment of
chronic inflammatory conditions. This project focuses on the design of supramolecular (self-assembling)
nanomaterials containing terminal complement proteins C3dg or C5a, which in previous work have been
shown to raise therapeutic anti-inflammatory B-cell and T-cell responses in mice. In contrast to passive
immunization with monoclonal antibodies, this active immunotherapy approach has advantageous
durability and greatly simplified dosing requirements. The central objectives of the work are to design
supramolecular complement assemblies towards two significant inflammatory diseases, rheumatoid
arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, and to clarify their protective mechanism of action. The work will
be undertaken by a collaborative team with expertise in supramolecular materials, active immunotherapies,
biomaterials for treating arthritis, and the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease. The outcomes
of this project are expected to be a demonstration that durable complement-neutralizing responses can be
generated using supramolecular assemblies, and that these responses have therapeutic efficacy in mouse
models of arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Broadly, these results will further champion the use of
biomaterials-based strategies for active immunotherapy, thus providing an alternative to monoclonal
antibodies and other protein biologics for treating not only inflammatory diseases, but a broad range of
other targets in the future."

Our community of investigators seeks renewed support for years 15 to 20 of a pre- and post-doctoral training
program that addresses the role of microbes in health and disease at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
Microbiology is fundamentally important to human health due to the prevalence and consequence of infectious
diseases. Its significance has been elevated by bioterrorism, discovery of the unforseen roles for microbes in
causing certain human maladies, and in promoting normal human physiology and health. The proposed
Microbes in Health and Disease (MHD) training program represents the natural and synergistic synthesis of the
broad disciplines of microbial pathogenesis, beneficial microbiology, and host responses. MHD will have its
physical and intellectual home in a state-of-the-art Microbial Sciences Building where basic and clinical
scientists interact and collaborate, providing a strong sense of place, cohesion and identity to the Training
Program. Our pre-doctoral trainees are drawn chiefly from the Microbiology Doctoral Training Program
(MDTP), a top ranked graduate program. Our post-doctoral fellows are drawn from a strong pool of PhD and
Infectious Disease MD fellows, the latter from Pediatrics and Internal Medicine programs with a strong history
of placing fellows into academic medicine. MHD holds bi-weekly meetings, hosts invited speakers, and has a
website and listserve. Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Bacteriology, Medicine and Pediatrics are core
departments of MHD and MDTP activities, and offer required didactic, journal club and seminar courses to our
trainees. Instruction is provided in host-microbe interactions, microbial pathogenesis, immunology, infectious
disease, translational medicine, and responsible conduct of research. Our 35 trainers span 9 departments in 4
colleges and collaborate with each other in research and teaching. All trainers are productive scientists with
proven NIH or equivalent funding records and strong records of graduate training. Most are tenured (23 full, 7
associate professors) and 5 promising junior faculty trainers will be mentored by senior training faculty. The
training program faculty are dedicated to recruiting outstanding students and fellows, including focused efforts
for minority candidates, and are committed to pre- and post-doctoral mentoring and didactic and research
training. To support these efforts, and the NIH-stated need to train scientists in the area of microbes in health
and disease, support is requested for 8 trainees annually: 5 predoctoral trainees and 3 postdoctoral trainees,
including two MD and one PhD fellows. Each trainee is mentored by a committee consisting of a thesis advisor
or mentor and 4 other faculty, and all trainees are also co-mentored by virtue of joint trainer service on these
committees. Our program and trainers are highly regarded in the scientific community, and fill a unique niche
on campus and a critical national need. The success of the program in the prior 5-year cycle is evidenced by
66 publications among the 14 trainees (mean, 4.7 per trainee) that have completed training to date, and their
progress into competitive postdoctoral positions or academic, industry or government research careers."
10843209,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Touch comprises an exquisite sensitivity to vibrations. This sensitivity underlies our ability to perceive
textures and sense through handheld tools. Much of the information conveyed by vibrations is carried in their
spectral content. Thus, vibration perception likely involves cortical processing that is analogous to the
processes that support hearing. Although the neural encoding of vibrations in the peripheral somatosensory
system is established, far less is known about vibration representations in the central nervous system. In this
project, we will extend on our investigations of the cortical basis of vibration processing and determine on how
vibration frequency representations are impacted by selective attention and multisensory context in the human
brain.
 Our understanding of how cortical responses relate to perception is predicated on knowledge of how
sensory information is selectively encoded in neural populations. Indeed, without knowing the logic of how
sensory signals are represented and transformed across the brain, it is difficult to understand how sensory
responses are shaped by attention state or multisensory context. Although much is known about neural tuning
for visual and auditory stimulus features, relatively little is known about somatosensory tuning mechanisms,
particularly with respect to the frequency content of vibrations. We recently uncovered evidence for
somatosensory tuning for vibration frequency in the human brain. This proposal builds on the observation of
somatosensory tuning to test the overarching hypothesis that a cortical processing hierarchy supports the
encoding and elaboration of vibration frequency information. We will address a number of fundamental
questions using human behavior, functional neuroimaging, and modeling. In Aim 1, we will establish how
selective attention impacts frequency representations in voxel-level activity. In Aim 2, we will establish how
auditory frequency information – which is known to bias tactile frequency perception in humans – is integrated
with vibration frequency information in voxel-level activity. In Aim 3, we will test more complex stimuli to identify
brain regions that respond to vibration comprising frequency changes (sweeps) and establish whether cortical
responses reflect tuning for time varying frequency signals.
 Collectively, these experiments will advance our understanding of how the human brain supports vibration
perception and how touch is combined with audition for multisensory cognition. Our findings may inform the
diagnosis and treatment of sensory, cognitive, and psychiatric disorders involving somatosensory deficits, such
as in individuals with brain damage, autism, schizophrenia, and age-related cognitive impairments including
Alzheimer’s disease."

Rheumatology Division Director Dr. Jill Buyon, will in its second cycle be co-directed under an mPI arrangement.
Adding to Dr. Buyon’s extensive translational experience in SLE and autoimmunity, Dr. Jose Scher provides
complementary expertise in inflammatory arthridities, including psoriatic and rheumatoid arthritis. Our mission
remains clear: to support trainees through an extended period of development; to leverage emerging research
opportunities to engage and excite physicians; and to bring clinical context to the pre-doctoral bench.
Accordingly, our program extends traditional ACGME training and again proposes support for 2-yr training of 3
fellowship graduates, plus 1 predoctoral MD/PhD candidate to establish an early pipeline to rheumatology. In our
first 4 years: a) 3 rheumatology graduates completed training (2 advancing to NYU faculty positions with external
multi-year grants and publications, and 1 garnering a leadership role in industry based on accomplishments; b)
2 pre-doctoral MD/PhD trainees successfully defended a PhD thesis with publications; c) 3 fellows and 1 MD/PhD
candidate (URM) remain in training; d) 2 NYU junior faculty advanced as Primary Mentors with new R01 awards
e) Dr. Timothy Niewold, expertise in type I Interferon, was recruited; f) new NIH research programs were added,
including a P50 in preclinical and clinical lupus, and renal and skin transcriptomics in SLE as part of AMP; g)
clinical/basic research programs addressing COVID-19 and rheumatic diseases spawned during the pandemic
engaged the pivot of trainees and faculty as they assumed unprecedented patient responsibilities. At the core of
the present proposal is interdisciplinary training along 2 methodologically distinct research tracks, each bearing the
prefix “translational” –basic or clinical – to emphasize the common purpose of all healthcare investigators. An Early
Scientist Pathway is again offered to MD/PhD candidates recruited through our school’s MD/PhD and graduate
programs, including the Immunology/Inflammation program and the newly established Translational Research
Immunology Center (TrIC). Training tracks are grounded in core disease clusters reflecting faculty expertise and
nationally recognized leadership: 1) lupus and diseases of systemic autoimmunity; 2) inflammatory and
autoimmune arthritis; and 3) degenerative and metabolic bone disease. Each incorporates common and
customized didactics; individualized research training experiences with teams of Primary, Associate, and
Methodological Mentors to integrate science and medicine; a hand-picked Advisory Mentoring Committee for each
trainee; and planning to support post-T32 faculty advancement. Programmatic success is evaluated though
Executive Committee meetings and an Annual Showcase Retreat. Strong institutional commitment supports
infrastructure and additional funding. The twice-renewed Clinical/Translational Science Institute provides extensive
resources. This T32 program represents the ongoing trajectory of our capacity-building and scientific dedication,
affirming and expanding commitment to advanced training in the rheumatic diseases."
10842873,"Project Summary
Our broad goal is to control the collective behavior of cells, similar to how a shepherd and
sheepdogs control a flock of sheep. This is of biomedical value because it is the coordinated
behaviors of cells that ultimately underlie our ability to heal and regenerate, the assembly of
complex organs, and the spread of invasive disease. Given the importance of collective cell
behaviors, we propose a two-part research program focused on much more deeply
understanding the origins and dynamics of collective cell behaviors, and using this
understanding to build new tools to literally ‘herd’ collective cell behaviors. In Program 1, we will
investigate the ‘rules’ of collective cell behaviors in much larger tissues than are normally
studied (we work at the cm-scale rather than micron-scale). We will connect our prior
discoveries on how large tissues coordinate their motion and cell division as they grow and heal
to new work on how thousands of cells in a tissue coordinate their use of energy and patterns of
gene expression. In Program 2, we will focus on further developing our unique bioelectric tools
that tap into an ancient collection of cellular responses to electric currents that we have
previously used to control cell migration. Here, we will investigate how electrical cues can
regulate collective processes such as tissue shape, stem cell differentiation, and gene activation
in engineered tissues. Progress in these areas may help us accelerate injury healing, delay
invasive disease, and improve how we grow tissues for regenerative medicine."
10827438,"Project Summary
The combined impacts of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and food insecurity can be devastating. According to
recent NHANES data, 19% of adults with T2D are food-insecure, and T2D prevalence is higher among those
with food insecurity. Individuals with T2D and food insecurity have worse diabetes self-management and
glycemic control compared to food-secure peers. While addressing food insecurity is important in T2D care,
individuals with food insecurity may also have other non-medical, health-related social needs (e.g.,
transportation barriers, housing instability, job insecurity) that may decrease their ability to attain glucose
targets and impact other diabetes-related health outcomes. Partnerships between healthcare systems and
community-based organizations have emerged as a promising approach to improve diabetes control in food-
insecure populations. Given the design limitations of prior studies, there remains a critical need for randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) to test the combined impact of diabetes education, food provision, and addressing
unmet social needs on glycemic control in people with T2D experiencing food insecurity. Leveraging existing
programs and relationships, we propose to test the combined effects of a food referral program, social needs
screening and referral, and diabetes education intervention on hemoglobin A1c in a population of
racially/ethnically diverse participants with food insecurity and T2D with A1c ≥7.5% identified at OSUWMC. We
plan to use a community-engaged research approach with community members and stakeholders informing
the design and focus of the interventions. Aim 1: Using a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (pRCT), to test
the effect of produce provision, diabetes education, and community referrals on A1c levels in individuals with
T2D experiencing food insecurity. Aim 2: To assess the cost-effectiveness of each of the interventions that
comprise the pRCT. Aim 3: To utilize a process evaluation to understand the contextual factors that impact the
uptake, effectiveness, and sustainability of the interventions. Impact: Our proposed study aligns with the
NIDDK’s interest in clinical studies addressing T2D treatment, complications, and health equity, as our project
directly examines health system-based approaches to address non-medical, health-related social needs to
improve health outcomes. Innovative solutions are warranted to combat the long-term sequelae of uncontrolled
T2D combined with food insecurity that contribute to the two-fold higher all-cause mortality in T2D that
disproportionality impacts lower socio-economic status and racial/ethnic minority populations. Food insecurity,
unmet social needs, and diabetes education are critical issues that must be addressed to improve T2D
treatment, care, and equity. Our study will provide essential evidence that will support both scalable and
sustainable partnerships to address these conditions."
10827439,"Cardiomyocytes are essentially non-renewing, so proteotoxicity from dysregulated Protein
Quality Control (PQC) is intimately associated with heart failure. The proteins that comprise the
cardiac sarcomere are responsible for force generation in the myocyte, and this constant mechanical
stress uniquely predisposes them to misfolding. Despite PQC’s central role in heart failure, and the
particular vulnerability of the sarcomere to misfolding, the PQC mechanisms that maintain the
cardiac sarcomere are almost entirely unknown. This is a critical knowledge gap that we will
address in this proposal. Our past work described a z-disc localized complex, anchored by the co-
chaperone Bcl2-associated athanogene-3 (BAG3), that was essential for sarcomere PQC. Z-disc
BAG3 levels were depressed in human heart failure (HF) and correlated with decreased sarcomeric
force-generating capacity (Fmax). Similarly, cardio-myocyte specific inducible BAG3 KO mice had
increased ubiquitination of sarcomeric proteins that remained integrated in the lattice, reducing force
generation. Importantly, BAG3 gene therapy in a mouse HF model reversed this phenotype,
indicating the potential of targeting sarcomere PQC to improve contractile function. In this renewal we
will address the central hypothesis that sarcomere PQC occurs via sarcomere-localized pathways
and depression of these systems in HF due to BAG3 instability results in accumulation of
ubiquitinated proteins that induce dysfunction. In Aim 1 we will Explore the spatiotemporal
organization of the key steps in sarcomere PQC. We will use super-resolution live cell imaging in
neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) and human iPSC-CMs to visualize the spatiotemporal
interplay between BAG3, autophagosomes, lysosomes, the z-disc, and BAG3-clients at baseline and
in response to various stress and stimuli, such as heat shock, localized laser damage, hypertrophic
signaling, and depressed BAG3 levels. In Aim 2 we will identify the functional consequences of
sarcomeric protein ubiquitination. We will use in vivo and in vitro approaches to modulate sarcomere
protein ubiquitination and assess the impact on sarcomere function with biophysical assays (force-
Ca2+ relationship, tension cost, in vitro motility assay, super-relaxed state, co-sedimentation). In Aim
3 we will discover the regulation of BAG3 in the cardiomyocyte and how it is altered in heart failure.
We will use several transgenic mouse lines and a myocardial infarction induced heart failure model,
to discover the interplay between HSP70, BAG3, heart failure, and sarcomere PQC. We expect to
identify new methods to stabilize BAG3 in the failing heart as a possible therapeutic strategy. These 3
aims establish a foundational understanding of sarcomere PQC, functional consequences of its
misregulation, and how it can be modulated in vivo."
10844544,"Despite important advances in the treatment of heart failure (HF), >50% of patients die within 5 years of
diagnosis at their first hospital admission, and HF remains a leading cause of morbidity, mortality and
healthcare expenditure in the United States. With the prevalence of HF expected to increase to 46% by 2030,
novel mechanistic insight into HF pathogenesis and strategies to interrupt this progression are a large unmet
clinical need. My research has focused on the role of exosomes or extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their cargo
RNAs (EV-RNAs) as novel functional biomarkers. We have discovered and validated plasma RNA signatures
that correlate with human HF phenotypes such as adverse structural remodeling after myocardial infarction,
fibrosis and sudden arrhythmic death. We have shown that many of these plasma RNAs are sequestered
within EVs and are a novel mode of intercellular communication. Importantly, many of these EV-RNAs change
in parallel in cardiac tissue, modulating complex signaling pathways that may underlie HF pathogenesis. This
work affords a unique opportunity to develop i) novel clinically useful biomarkers for improved risk stratification
of HF patients; and ii) novel therapeutic targets to interrupt the adverse remodeling process.
I now seek to leverage the tools and platforms developed over the past 5 years to move the EV and EV-RNA
field in new directions using the flexible R35 grant mechanism. I seek to broadly address the following broad
areas of unmet need.
 1. Improve the performance (including prognostic/predictive accuracy and coefficient of variance) of plasma
RNA biomarkers by more specifically measuring EV-RNAs on validated platforms in biorepository plasma
samples from carefully-phenotyped HF and post-MI patients.
2. Determine a functional role for EVs isolated from human HF samples with varied phenotypes in simplified
cell culture (iPSC-derived CMs) and organ-on-chip models
3. Leverage a novel murine model of exosome tracking (ExoMap) mouse to determine the functional
consequences of exosome targeting in cardiomyocytes and other cardiac cells in murine models of ischemic
and non-ischemic HF using single cell nuclear RNAseq.
4. Identify small molecule regulators of EV release/uptake to manipulate EV-mediated signaling in these
murine models.
5. Leverage newly identified cellular RNA biomarkers to develop novel conditional siRNA therapeutics that
target cardiac hypertrophy, autophagy and fibrosis.
The flexibility and latitude afforded by the R35 mechanism will allow me to pursue these high-risk high-reward
experiments that seek to address critical gaps in this field and will also provide time for devoting to mentoring
of the next generation of cardiovascular disease investigators."
10844899,"Summary
For a complex organ like heart, well-organized interactions between different cell types are essential for its
effective functioning. Cell-cell communication between these myriad cell types therefore appears to be key
component of cardiac function and a better understanding of how different cells within injured myocardium
communicate with each other during homeostasis and injury and elucidation of molecular events downstream
of such communications is critical to identify new therapeutic targets for cardiac healing after injury. Increasing
evidence suggest that extracellular vesicles (EVs) including exosomes are major paracrine conduits of cardiac
cell-cell communication in homeostasis and disease conditions. However, a comprehensive understanding of
how cardiac injury alters exosome-mediated cell-cell communications both locally within myocardium and at
long distance organs such as bone marrow and adipose tissue and whether these exosome-mediated
alterations in cell-cell communications influence overall cardiac structure and function and repair is not well
understood. The overarching hypothesis of this renewal application is that cardiac injury alters exosome-
mediated specific cell-cell communication both locally within the injured myocardium and distally with other
organs and these intra-cellular and inter-organ communications influence overall myocardial responses to
injury and repair processes. To test our hypothesis, we have assembled a team of highly accomplished
scientists who have the potential to markedly advance the science and application of exosome biology for
ischemic tissue repair. In particular, the design of this program, highlighted in inter-related yet unique individual
projects, intends to capitalize on our existing synergy and assets. We will utilize the advantage of strategically
designed scientific cores that will support each project. We will apply various techniques of molecular, cellular,
and biochemical approaches in cell models and mice models of myocardial injury and repair. Project 1
(Kishore) examines the role of stressed cardiomyocyte-derived exosomes, particularly cardiomyocyte specific
microRNAs, on post-injury endothelial and endothelial progenitor cell function and angiogenesis. Project 2
(Walter Koch) focuses upon the involvement of cardiac exosomes containing G-protein coupled receptor kinase
2 on adipocytes and cardiac cell function. Project 3 (Tilley) examines the role of beta-2 adrenergic receptor on
myeloid cell exosomes and cardiac functions. All three projects involve in-depth molecular, cellular, and
physiological studies comprising of mouse models of myocardial injury. Establishing the role of exosomes in
post-injury cell to cell communications may identify new mechanisms and therapeutic targets for post-injury
myocardial repair. The goal of this program will be to delineate exosome mediated signaling mechanisms and
determine how they can be utilized to restore and enhance endogenous cellular repair processes that heal the
damaged heart."

Congenital Hydrocephalus (CH), the pathological expansion of the cerebral ventricles due to cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) accumulation, is a common birth defect affecting 1 in every 1000 births, with high mortality and morbidity.
Treatment options are limited to surgery, which has a 50% failure rate. The lack of treatment modalities is, in
part, due to our incomplete understanding of hydrocephalus pathogenesis. Current human genetics studies
identified novel candidate genes (SMARCC1, TRIM71, PTCH1, SHH) in patients with CH. Despite their known
roles in neural stem cells, their role in hydrocephalus pathogenesis is unknown. In this work, we will use the frog
Xenopus model system to understand the underlying pathogenesis. Our recent work paired optical coherence
tomography imaging (OCT) and CRISPR/CAS9 system with the frog Xenopus to model human congenital
hydrocephalus. We demonstrated that OCT imaging of mutant tadpoles could readily detect hallmarks of human
hydrocephalus, including aqueductal stenosis and ventriculomegaly. Importantly Xenopus, as a model system,
can rapidly evaluate CH candidate genes and distinguish communicating vs. non-communicating pathogenesis
mechanisms. Our central hypothesis is that the pathogenesis of CH due to different genetic backgrounds will be
discretely different for ventricular morphology, CSF flow network, and neural progenitor cell fate, which can have
important implications for treatment. Overall, our goal is to shed light on the mechanism of hydrocephalus
pathogenesis to identify novel targets for medical management options."

The Center for Lung Biology and Disease was established through a Phase I Centers of Biomedical
Research Excellence (COBRE) award. Our Phase I proposal, aimed at providing Promising Junior
Investigators (PJIs) an environment that maximizes their potential to contribute to advances in
pulmonary disease research, launched 6 new scientists in independent research careers funded through
11 R-, 1F- and 1K-series NIH grants. This Phase II proposal will expand the tremendously successful
programs established in Phase I, with an overarching goal of promoting research to unravel life-
threatening respiratory diseases. Its thematic focus encompasses mechanistic studies of host
responses to infectious and non-infectious stimuli. The leadership and mentoring teams are highly
interactive and our four new PJIs are a dynamic group. In aim 1 of our strategy to launch these PJIs as
independent researchers, we will maintain and expand an administrative structure that supports and fosters PJI
progress toward scientific independence. This will be accomplished by coordinating activities of the individual
projects and cores and fostering their collaborative engagement. We will also provide career and professional
resources that together with a team of mentors with strong experience in NIH-funded lung biology, will foster PJI
growth toward independent funding. In aim 2, we will enhance the research infrastructure at the LSU School of
Veterinary Medicine and provide cutting-edge technologies for enhancing the competitiveness of our PJIs.
Through partial funding from our Phase I award, we renovated and expanded our Animal Biosafety Level-2
(ABSL-2) footprint, and in this proposal, we will use institutional support to renovate and increase the footprint
of our ABSL-3 facility 2-3-fold. Given the landscape of junior investigator research within our LSU Vet Med
environment, where lung biology research emphasizes diseases induced by both infectious diseases and
inhalation exposures, we have realized the need for providing one new resource – the Inhalation and Infection
Core. The new core will assist investigators with animal infection and delivery of inhaled pollutants and/or
therapeutic agents to support their mechanistic studies of respiratory diseases induced through both infectious
and non-infectious stimuli. Finally, in aim 3, we will navigate pathways for sustained Center funding supported
through the NIH P01 grant program, with the ultimate goal of positioning our growing depth of lung biology
expertise to develop a Center of Excellence. The team assembled here has exceptional expertise in lung
biology, outstanding leadership and mentoring experience, and a demonstrated history of productive
collaboration. This COBRE program will provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of devastating lung
diseases to guide improved strategies for treating and preventing these diseases in human populations."
10850775,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Many age-related oral health problems, such as masticatory dysfunction, dysphagia, periodontal disease, and tooth loss
have been associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). How cortical and biomechanical changes in oromotor behavior
contribute to the onset and progression of AD and age-related dementias (ARD) are widely unknown. This is largely
because of a fundamental gap in understanding the neuromechanical processes, at the level of large-scale activity of single
neurons and neuronal networks, that underlie healthy aging. This represents an important problem because until they
are understood, the cortical mechanisms underlying pathological aging in AD/ARD will remain largely incomprehensible.
The goal of the proposed research is to investigate changes in the orofacial sensorimotor-cognitive neuronal network that
underlie healthy age-related sensorimotor changes and how these cortical correlates are affected by absent sensory inputs
to oral structures and by the presence of AD-like impairments (‘pathological aging’) in old rhesus macaques. The central
hypothesis is that differential patterns of the dynamics of large-scale neural activity and connectivity in the orofacial
sensorimotor cortex (OSMcx) and the ventrolateral frontal cortex (VLFcx) will help disambiguate healthy and pathological
aging. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) to identify the neuronal correlates of healthy age-
related changes in feeding behavior, (2) to identify changes in cortical representations of oral somatosensation following
sensory nerve block, and (3) to identify changes in neuronal responses and cortical interactions in OSMcx-VLFcx networks
following drug-induced AD-like impairments. Thus, we can evaluate and compare the added burden of sensory loss and
AD-like impairments on aging. The proposed research uses an innovative approach that leverages the unique sensory
innervation of the oral region by different cranial nerves and the use of a pharmacological model to induce AD-like
impairments in old rhesus macaques. We will record cortical activity from multiple chronically implanted microelectrode
arrays in OSMcx-VLFcx simultaneously with 3D tracking of tongue and jaw kinematics using biplanar videoradiography and
the XROMM workflow (X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology) while young and old subjects engage in natural
feeding behavior. The proposed research is significant for (1) defining cortical, biomechanical, and immunohistological
profiles of healthy and pathological aging, (2) determining potential contributing factors to the onset and progression of
AD, and (3) identifying cortical regions that are vulnerable to AD. Using old rhesus macaques has direct translational value
to evaluate potential avenues for pharmacological or cortical therapies for AD. The knowledge gained from the proposed
study has important implications for earlier identification of individuals with chronic oral health issues who may be at risk
for developing AD or ARDs. It may also inform the development of more effective interventions focused on enhancing oral
health outcomes in this group and thus preventing the onset or allaying the progression of AD or ARD."
10850778,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The availability of contemporary antiretroviral therapy (ART) has changed infection into a manageable chronic
disease for people living with HIV (PLWH) who have access to and are adherent with treatment. Adherence to
medications for either HIV or major medical and mental health conditions is frequently suboptimal even for
those with prescription coverage. Those with multiple, chronic diseases face compounded adverse
consequences when they fail to take necessary medications. Prescription drug cost containment efforts may
undermine long-term adherence with implications for adverse health consequences, though the body of
literature is fairly limited and dated particularly in the context of HIV. Despite this understanding, plan
managers, particularly states' Medicaid programs, continue to implement restrictions through a variety of
utilization management strategies such as prescription cap policies, limiting the number of medications
covered per month. In our recent analyses of persistence rates for ART, renin angiotensin antagonists, and
metformin in HIV+ versus HIV- Medicaid enrollees, we noted lower persistence in states with restrictive
prescription caps. Our long-term research goal is to ensure effective medication utilization management
policies which balance budget priorities with population quality and quantity of life. The objective of this
application is to evaluate the how Medicaid prescription cap policies impact the health of persons with HIV and
public expenditures. We propose to study national enrollment, prescription, hospital, and medical claims data
across multiple years, exploiting the adoption of, changes to, and redaction of medication caps. In particular,
we will study Medicaid and Medicare enrollees with HIV to illustrate how state-based policies contribute to
outcomes in this particularly vulnerable population. These natural experiments will offer significant insights into
the impact of restrictive prescription policies on patients' health outcomes and public budgets. The central
hypothesis is that prescription caps will lead patients with HIV to greater rates of HIV and non-HIV chronic
disease complications, leading to additional costs. The rationale for this hypothesis is that people with HIV
frequently have co-occurring conditions likely to require several prescriptions simultaneously and capping the
number they receive each month may undermine their health. We have already made a large investment in
and established extensive experience with Medicaid claims data from 14 high HIV prevalence states (2001-
2012). Through the addition of three more years of Medicaid claims (2013-2015) and the inclusion of Medicare
Parts A, B and D claims from ~300,000 HIV infected beneficiaries across the country from 2006-2015, we will
have a comprehensive infrastructure from which we can describe the impact of prescription caps on ART
adherence, evaluate the impact of prescription cap policies on adherence to medications for major comorbid
conditions (i.e., diabetes, cardiovascular disease, serious mental illness), and estimate the potentially
avoidable health and economic effects of ART and chronic disease medication adherence."

There is broad awareness of the shortage of physician-scientists nationally. However, the lack of racial
diversity in the physician-scientist workforce is particularly dire. This deficit has profound consequences that
impact scientific innovation, health policy, and leadership. It also negatively impacts the trust afforded to
physicians and scientists by diverse patient populations.
Fostering diversity of physicians and physician-scientists in the workforce by enhancing undergraduate
educational, mentoring, and in-depth research experiences is a stated goal of the NHLBI and this RFA. To
respond to this charge, we recently developed a pilot, integrated, longitudinal program to promote the diversity
of students and future faculty in biomedical sciences and engineering. The program is known as The Medical
Physician Engineers, Scientists, and Clinicians Preparatory program [MPESC-Prep]. We build on and expand
our pilot to target three institutions who will partner with us to provide four key components that promote
sustained scientific interest and subsequent professional success in diversity undergraduates. These
components include: an in-depth research experience, mentoring, community, and curriculum.
This program includes identification of a research mentor and laboratory to support the student longitudinally
through 2-3 summers in the same research laboratory. The mentors provide professional insights through
regular mentoring meetings, and research experiences leading to research presentations and publications.
Parallel shadowing experiences with a physician faculty member will provide complementary clinical insights.
The focus will consistently be on the professional development of the students pursuing interests in becoming
a physician-scientist/engineer. These focused experiences are supplemented by curricular content to provide
a framework that is college level appropriate while enhancing their understanding of basic biology,
bioinformatics, and research processes. Finally, a series of informal and semiformal events (such as brown
bag lunches) with their peer group, MSTP students, and faculty will be provided to further build a sense of
community.
We will evaluate the implementation of our program to assess the 4 core components of the program guided
by a logic model with key inputs, activities, outputs and short- and long-term outcomes. Achieving these
outcomes ensures that we inspire, nurture, and train the next generation scientific leaders in the
cardiovascular, pulmonary, and hematologic science."
10850780,"SUMMARY: Progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and subsequent degeneration of
optic nerve is among the most common ophthalmic neuropathies that affect populations
worldwide. A promising therapeutic strategy relies on using stem cells to reconstruct functional
retinal ganglion cells in vitro that can be used to replace dying cells in affected patients. However,
for this strategy to be successful, a thorough understanding to the molecular mechanisms of RGC
specification and differentiation are needed to elucidate and exploit normal RGC developmental
pathways and thereby maximize RGC generation for cell replacement therapies. Our previous
work has mapped the epigenetic landscape dynamics during mouse and human developing
retina. However, there is a fundamental gap in our knowledge to the role of 3D chromatin topology
in RGC development and maintenance. Experiments in this proposal will address this role by
combining innovative state of the art genomic and genetic tools to elucidate the chromatin
architecture dynamics that accompany RGC genesis and to determine how they function in vivo.
Our central hypothesis is that temporal and spatial regulation of ganglion cell genesis is
associated with dynamic 3D genomic interactions between specific non-coding DNA elements
and genes that drive RGC differentiation and optic nerve growth. To test this hypothesis, we will
elucidate the link between 3D chromatin architecture and the expression of a transcription factor
essential for RGC formation. We will also dissect the functional significance of constituents of the
regulatory landscape that accommodates RGC differentiation in vivo. Finally, we will integrate
ChIP-Seq data with techniques that map chromatin topology to elucidate the long-range genomic
interactions that are associated with components of the regulatory networks that are required for
RGC differentiation. When completed the results of this proposal will advance our understanding
to the 3D regulatory landscape that accommodates the generation of RGCs in vivo, a necessary
knowledge to enhance RGC replacement therapies in RGC degenerative diseases.
Project Summary- Al Diri 1"
10850871,"This project focuses on cortical mechanisms in areas V1, V2, and V4 (V1-2-4) underlying the information-
processing roles of saccades and fixational eye movements (FxEMs: microsaccades and drift) in vision. Both
saccades and microsaccades are followed by drift. Sequences of saccade/drift and microsaccade/drift cycles,
both of which we will refer to as saccade/drift cycles (SDC’s), are believed to be critical to gathering information
about visual scenes and the objects within them. We will record single-unit and local field potential (LFP) activity
from the foveal projection in areas V1-2-4 simultaneously while monkeys perform match-to-sample tasks for
shape or texture, with shapes filled with texture, to understand the role of SDC’s in cortical processing during
active vision. Through the use of gaze-stabilization, we will be able to disrupt the retinal input to the cortex during
the task to probe selectively how SDC’s control processing of shape and texture in early visual areas.
 In active vision, the SDC maps spatial information into temporal patterns of neural activity. Recent modeling
and psychophysical work have determined that the initial transient phase of the cycle encodes coarse features,
while the later, more prolonged period of drift is critical for extracting fine details. We are interested in how the
transition from coarse to fine processing in the SDC is implemented in local and inter-areal cortical networks.
We hypothesize that processing in these networks during the SDC begins with a phase of transient feedforward
activity followed by a longer phase of recurrent and re-entrant activity that coincides with gamma oscillations in
the networks. We hypothesize that shape is captured in the initial phase of the SDC and finer features of the
shape’s border and the region within the shape by the recurrent phase of processing during drift. We also suggest
that the cortex uses sequences of SDC’s to accumulate information and that the organization of networks within
the cortex, in terms of their hierarchy and temporal frequency band for communication, depends on whether the
sequence is dominated by saccades and drift (looking) or by microsaccades and drift (fixating).
 In AIM 1, we focus on activity phase-locked to the SDC where the match to sample for shape or texture is
fixed for an entire day’s session. The SDC’s in this task will be dominated by microsaccades/drifts. We will ask
if accurate matches for shape coincide with stronger SDC transients in the network and if accurate matches for
texture produce robust gamma coherence that emerges later in the SDC. In AIM 2, we investigate sequences of
SDC’s in periods of looking and fixating for a match-to-sample task where the monkey is given a cue on every
trial for the correct match of shape or texture. Information is gained across the trial through saccades and FxEMs,
and we ask how the dynamics of V1-2-4 network activity, phase-locked to these sequences, reflect performance
and task. Gaze-stabilization will be used in both AIMs to impact cortical processing of the sample stimulus. How
the SDC’s modulate the causal relationships between cortical areas and the dynamics of those interactions will
be examined through a new method of analysis, frequency-extracted hierarchical decomposition."

 Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths in women. Compared to non-
Hispanic white (NHW) women, African American (AA) women have much poorer survival after an EOC
diagnosis, which, as we have found, may be in part due to AA women being less likely to receive standard-of-
care therapy, and more likely to have chemotherapy dose reduction, even within an equal-access healthcare
system. However, these factors do not completely explain survival disparities among AAs, and furthermore,
little is known about other groups (e.g., Hispanics and Asians/Pacific Islanders (API)), although there is some
evidence that Hispanic women also experience worse survival. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests racial
differences in molecular subtype distribution. We propose to conduct the first integrative, cells-to-society
evaluation of the interplay among multilevel factors on disparities in EOC treatment and survival outcomes.
 We will assemble a cohort of ~4,600 EOC cases, including ~280 AA, ~520 Hispanic, ~730 API, and
~2,980 NHW women diagnosed at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) between 2000 and 2023.
KPNC has longstanding electronic clinical databases, complete pathology specimen storage, long-term
retention of members, and substantial variability in sociodemographic, clinical, and neighborhood
characteristics among races/ethnicities. We will perform centralized pathology review to classify histotypes by
the recent gold standard WHO criteria, and will conduct chart review to capture data that are not available
electronically. We will examine determinants of racial/ethnic differences in treatment received, recurrence, and
survival (overall and EOC-specific), including neighborhood social stressors through linkage to data on
segregation, structural racism, ethnic enclaves, and geographic medical accessibility, health care system and
patient-level factors. In 800 women (200 each of NHW, AA, Hispanic, and API) with high grade serous EOC,
we will also characterize gene expression subtypes (to date studied almost exclusively in NHW women), to
identify whether the relative distribution of aggressive subtypes contributes to the observed survival disparities.
We will examine these factors in the context of both self-reported race/ethnicity and genetic ancestry.
 Our comprehensive integrative approach to examine the interplay among patient, health care, social
contextual, and biological factors will provide unique insights into the persistent racial disparities in EOC
survival. The KPNC setting provides the opportunity to examine these factors while minimizing confounding by
the known contribution of insurance status, leveraging rich clinical databases to investigate and control for
detailed prognostic variables, and avoiding survival bias. For EOC, this proposed study is unprecedented in its
transdisciplinary nature, sample size, and multi-ethnic population, and will serve as a unique resource for
future research related to multilevel factors to reduce EOC survival disparities."
10851952,"More than half of all infectious disease outbreaks across the globe are zoonotic, involving pathogen spillover from animal reservoirs to humans. Ebola and other filoviruses rank among the most deadly zoonoses. Recent large outbreaks with mortality in the thousands both in humans and wildlife underscore the pressing need to better understand the factors promoting filovirus spillover. Although spillover is commonly defined as a pathogen crossing species boundaries, there are relatively few empirical studies or modeling frameworks that explicitly consider ecological boundaries across which spillover occurs. Crossing ecological boundaries involves processes that occur at many levels of organization: physiological processes at the individual level, interspecies interactions between individuals at the population level, interactions between populations of different species at the community level, and interactions between ecological communities within landscapes. Processes accelerating spillover often involve human activities such as habitat encroachment and land conversion, which are themselves ultimately driven by socioeconomic factors. In the context of Ebola and other filoviruses in Africa, we will develop the data sets, theoretical models and statistical tools needed for a general descriptive and predictive framework for spillover at ecological boundaries. Our project will follow an iterative design where results from mechanistic models are used to refine patterns that we test for empirically, and statistical models of large-scale data allow us to more realistically parameterize mechanistic models. Our work will test the generality of specific theories that so far have been applied only to a limited number of study systems. For example, ours will be among the first attempts to test the influence of Schmalhausen’s law -- an evolutionary theory that may explain the tendency for large outbreaks to occur at the edges of species ranges or during unusual weather conditions and which to date has primarily been investigated in the context of malaria -- in pathogens that rely on direct transmission. This work will demonstrate how new methods can provide unifying insight into patterns in critically important disease transmission systems and will enhance our ability to predict spillover of both filoviruses and many other zoonotic pathogens. Note that no human subjects, biohazards, or select agents will be involved in this project."
10836980,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Nature has mastered the ability to use bioavailable metals to achieve spectacular transformations of chemistry,
by combining them with diverse protein folds, and unique coordination environments. Through the assembly of
metalloproteins and metalloenzymes, Nature has achieved remarkable diversity in chemical transformations
and in tuning the nascent properties of metal ions such as iron, through generating yet-further-modifiable
redox-active cofactors, like iron-sulfur clusters and iron bound in heme cofactors. To achieve that diversity,
specific protein scaffolds and arrangements of iron-sulfur clusters, and/or heme groups have been elaborated
upon extensively, giving us diverse chemistry — much of which, the fields of enzymology and bioinorganic are
still discovering today. Two NIGMS funded research areas ongoing in the Elliott Group at Boston University
are (1) Query the structure-function relationships of the vast, “AdoMet Radical Enzyme (ARE) superfamily”,
where tens of thousands of reactions are thought to be catalyzed by hundres of thousands of distinct members
of the ARE, through the study of the redox traits of the iron sulfur clusters found in the ARE superfamily; and
(2) Test hypotheses about structural and chemical diversity found with heme containing enzymes of the so-
called “bacterial cytochrome c peroxidase (bCCP) superfamily” found within gram negative micro-organisms.
Through these two related projects, which form the background of the current R35 proposal, the diversity of
structures, function and redox chemistries of metalloproteins are examined through a combination of
electrochemical, biophysical, bioinformatic, and structural approaches. The mechanistic details of the ARE
superfamily are still forthcoming, where many novel states of iron-sulfur clusters have been proposed; here we
will bring our electrochemical lens to bear upon the nature of those states, in order to understand the
thermodynamics and kinetics of their generation and inter-conversion. With respect to the bCCP superfamily,
we have recently demonstrated that novel forms of reactivity of enzymes of this superfamily can be found by
looking beyond the canonical family members that have been examined for the past 20 years. Here we
propose to examine other new family members that are suggested to engage in sulfur-conversions relevant to
the microbiome and to human health. Together, these studies marry our interests in bioinformatics and
biophysical chemistry, to probe the diversity of nature's redox enzymes, revealing not only what is possible in
the chemistry of these remarkable catalysts, but how nature masters the desired reactivity with the correct
metallocofactor."
10836981,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Sepsis affects approximately 1.7 million patients in the US annually, is one of the leading causes of mortality,
and is a major driver of US healthcare costs. African American/Black (AA/B) and LatinX populations
experience higher rates of sepsis complications, deviations from standard care, and all-cause and sepsis
readmissions compared with Non-Hispanic White (NHW) populations. Despite clear evidence of the ways in
which structural racism compounds factors at the hospital and community levels to generate poorer sepsis
care and outcomes for AA/B and LatinX patients, there are no evidence-based, prospective interventions to
name and address structural racism in sepsis care, nor are we aware of studies that report reductions in racial
inequities in sepsis care as an outcome. Naming and addressing the impact of structural racism on sepsis care
will require collective action across health systems and community institutions, supported by ways of working
(e.g., organizational culture) to collaborate effectively across historical, political, and organizational boundaries.
Our prior research has shown that coalition-based leadership development approaches can be effective in
cultivating organizational culture that can improve complex health outcomes. We propose to adapt, deliver, and
evaluate a coalition-based intervention to equip health systems and their surrounding communities to name
and address structural racism and drive measurable reductions in inequities in sepsis outcomes. Our specific
aims are to: (1) Adapt and deliver a coalition-based leadership intervention in eight U.S. health systems and
their surrounding communities to improve domains of organizational culture that are required to name and
address structural racism; (2) Evaluate the impact of the intervention using a longitudinal, convergent mixed
methods approach to quantify change in domains of organizational culture that are required to name and
address structural racism using a novel survey instrument and describe the experience of culture change
within each system, integrating quantitative and qualitative data at the analysis phase in order to develop a
comprehensive understanding of the intervention impact and mechanisms by which the impact may have
occurred; and (3) Evaluate the impact of the intervention on reduction of racial inequities in three clinical
outcomes: a) early identification (time to antibiotic), b) clinical management (in-hospital sepsis mortality) and c)
standards-based follow up (same-hospital, all-cause sepsis readmissions) using interrupted time series
analysis and comparing clinical outcomes from systems that achieved meaningful change in domains of culture
required to address structural racism with those that did not achieve meaningful change. The proposed study is
timely, highly relevant, and fully aligned with calls to action by the NIH and the Sepsis Alliance to address
inequities in sepsis care and outcomes. It is also highly innovative, as it would be the first to intervene
prospectively to mitigate effects of structural racism by developing the domains of organizational culture that
are required for anti-racist action, with implications for inequities in complex health outcomes beyond sepsis."

Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) remains woefully underdiagnosed and undertreated in the US. Recent
work from the PI demonstrated the ability to identify blood donors with FH at a similar prevalence as would be
expected in the general population. The overall objective in this mixed methods study is to apply
implementation strategies to improve treatment of blood donors with FH. The central hypothesis is that the
blood donation system can be an effective portal to increase receipt of treatment for individuals with FH. The
central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing four specific aims: 1) identify barriers and facilitators to receipt of
(low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) LDL-C treatment in blood donors with FH to inform implementation
strategy development, 2) develop and produce an implementation strategy bundle to increase LDL-C treatment
in blood donors with FH, 3) conduct a Type 2 implementation-effectiveness trial for LDL-C lowering in a
community-based blood donation center, and 4) evaluate the implementation bundle using mixed methods.
This research will be guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Science Research (CFIR),
and will use Implementation Mapping, a theory- and evidence-based process, to develop, implement, and
evaluate these treatment enhancing strategies. In the first aim, semi-structured interviews will be used to elicit
barriers and facilitators of statin treatment from key stakeholders including: a) blood donors with FH b) family
members of donors c) blood donation personnel d) community physicians. Stakeholder feedback will be
iteratively integrated to develop, produce, and refine an implementation strategies bundle in the second aim,
that will be tested in Aim 3. The third aim consists of a two-arm randomized trial among blood donors with FH
comparing a) usual notification of high cholesterol or b) the implementation strategies bundle from Aim 2 with
the primary outcome of difference in change in LDL-C levels from baseline to 6 months. The fourth aim will
assess the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the implementation strategy bundle and will inform
development of a dissemination package to implement an FH program in other blood donor centers. The
research proposed in this application is innovative, in our opinion, because it incorporates the blood donor
program, an entirely new approach to identifying and treating FH. This novel portal of enhancing FH treatment
involves younger individuals who are less likely to seek regular medical care and complements traditional
strategies focusing on patients with medical homes. Ultimately, if successful, this program, informed by
implementation science methods, can be rapidly scaled to blood donation centers nationally involving 6.4
million donors annually, having an immediate impact on gaps in FH care."

 Consequences caused by alcohol misuse continue to be a public health concern in the United States,
especially among emerging adults (EA; individuals aged ~18-24). Previous intervention efforts have shown
reductions in alcohol use; however, results have been limited in the reduction of negative consequences, with
efforts focused almost solely on college students. Research on alcohol use, attention, and decision-making has
indicated alcohol increases the saliences of impelling cues (factors that incite action by drawing attention to
benefits of a behavior), and decreases inhibiting cues (factors that prevent behavior by drawing attention to
disadvantages). However, there is a lack of research examining cues associated with many alcohol-related
consequences EA experience. Importantly, these cues may consist of a number of internal and external factors
from mood/affect to specific locations or people. Understanding cues that precede consequences may provide
an important avenue for intervention to impact in-the-moment decisions made while drinking. This project
proposes three phases of research to provide insight on cues associated with consequences and develop an
intervention designed from the relapse prevention framework that trains EA to become aware of these cues
and choose safe behaviors by managing situations when then arise. Phase 1 will be a detailed collection of
data (both qualitative and quantitative) on cues surrounding decisions made while drinking that influence
alcohol related consequences. Phase 1 will include both sober interviews and an alcohol administration
paradigm that will assess how level of intoxication may impact attention and perceived importance of cues.
Phase 2 will utilize research from Phase 1 to develop a web- and text message-based intervention and Phase
3 will be a pilot feasibility test of the developed intervention. This research is coupled with a detailed training
program for the applicant that focuses on expanding knowledge the key components of empirically-supported
treatments and adapting them to brief interventions, building methodological and analytical skills in alcohol
administration and qualitative research, and integrating user-centered design and technology into brief
interventions."
10837102,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This application is in response to two objectives of RFA-AA-21-016: HIV Prevention and Alcohol to translate
basic behavioral science findings about alcohol’s effects on sexual decision-making to 1). Test an intervention
designed to address sexual decision-making in the “heat-of-the-moment” (i.e., when intoxicated and sexually
aroused), and 2). Extend laboratory research to test cognitive and motivational within-person mechanisms
underlying alcohol and arousal effects on sexual decision-making in the natural environment. The application is
informed by our previous alcohol challenge laboratory research on factors contributing to CAI among MSM.
This research showed that intoxication was associated with heightened sexual arousal and increased CAI
intentions. Consistent with dual process theories, intoxication and arousal were associated with a shift in
decision-making process characterized by an increased role of sexual reward motivation relative to condom
use motivation and a corresponding decrease in the role of executive functioning. This pattern suggests that
prevention interventions may be effective in reducing CAI by targeting strategies that enhance condom use
motivation and reduce the reliance on effortful / controlled processing in the “heat-of-the-moment.” We piloted
an intervention that integrates motivational interviewing, personalized cognitive counseling, and text messaging
that decreased alcohol consumption and CAI in MSM. The intervention is designed, in part, to foster increased
condom-related planning and increase the use of implementation scripts to foster use of condoms in the “heat-
of-the-moment.” In AIM 1, we extend the pilot work on the intervention to a larger sample and an intensive
longitudinal design comprised of 3-weeks of experience sampling method (ESM) pre- and post- intervention to
test the intervention’s mechanisms of action. Specifically, we hypothesize that A. the intervention will be
associated with reduced alcohol intoxication and CAI, B. the intervention will reduce within-person associations
of intoxication and arousal with CAI, and C. intoxication and condom-related planning will mediate associations
between intervention condition and CAI at 4-month follow-up. Of particular importance is hypothesis B, which
tests whether the intervention affects sexual decision-making in the “heat-of-the-moment” when compelling
cues are prominent. Aim 2 extends to the natural environment our laboratory research to test dual-process
theory derived mechanisms linking intoxication, arousal, and CAI. Here, we test if sexual delay discounting and
working memory mediate, within-person, associations of intoxication and arousal with CAI and if changes in
these effects underlie the intervention effects during the 3-week post-intervention period. The proposed study
will advance understanding of within-person processes affecting sexual decision-making in the “heat-of-the-
moment” when drive for immediate gratification peaks, test the effectiveness of a brief intervention, and identify
the intervention’s effects on both within-person processes proximal to CAI as well as between-person
mechanisms of behavior change."

Despite the success of immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs), only a subset of patients responds to ICBs. In
addition, patients treated with ICBs exhibit high incidences of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Thus,
there is a critical need for powerful yet safe combination approaches for immunotherapy. In particular, recent
studies have shown that the gut microbiome plays a crucial role in cancer patients' response rate to ICBs. The
current approaches to restore healthy gut microbiome include oral ingestion of defined probiotics or fecal
microbiota transplantation. However, it will be very challenging to develop these as a pharmaceutical product
due to scale-up manufacturing and quality control. To address these challenges, we are developing a new
technology that can improve cancer immunotherapy by targeting the colon and modulating the gut microbiome
in situ. We are developing an oral inulin-gel formulation that can modulate the gut microbiome and promote
strong anti-tumor T cell response. In preliminary studies, we have shown that our inulin-gel can significantly
augment the anti-tumor efficacy of anti-PD-1 ICB therapy without toxicity in multiple murine models. Here, we
will apply the multidisciplinary tools of pharmaceutics, bioengineering, and immunology to understand the
structure-function relationship among inulin-gel, colon-targeting, gut microbiome, and host immune responses.
As our inulin-gel is entirely based on FDA's generally regarded as safe (GRAS) list, our approach may offer a
powerful yet safe and facile strategy for augmenting the host immune responses in a safe and effective manner."

 New neurons in the adult human and animal hippocampus have been implicated in several cognitive
functions. These functions are profoundly impaired by the loss or insufficient production of new neurons. Neurons
are produced after a prolonged series of transitions including the activation, proliferation, elimination, and
differentiation of neural stem cells and their progeny. Competing hypotheses have been proposed to describe
how these steps are executed. These hypotheses imply divergent, sometimes contradicting, blueprints of the
transitions from stem cells to neurons, as well as different outcomes when these blueprints are perturbed by
aging or disease. Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a dramatic adverse effect on hippocampal neurogenesis in
humans and in animal models, and this decrease is thought to be directly linked to the cognitive dysfunction
observed in AD. Identifying the changes in neurogenesis induced by AD and differentiating them from the
changes induced by aging may reveal new means of mitigating or even reversing AD-associated cognitive
impartment. This goal is challenging not only because of the complexity of the system, but also because of the
limitations inherent in currently available approaches for tracing stem cells and their progeny.
 We have recently developed a novel approach of endogenous barcoding to determine the lineage trajectory
and differentiation trajectories of neural stem cells in the adult mouse brain. In addition, we have developed a
new technique for combinatorial multitag labeling of subpopulations of dividing stem cells and their progeny. Now
we propose applying these new approaches to identify the changes that AD and aging induce in the basic
scheme of neural stem cell division and differentiation and to examine how those changes can be mitigated.
 In our first specific aim, we will introduce the Polylox barcode cassette and related genes into the genome
of mouse models of AD, apply recombination-induced endogenous barcoding, and perform barcode analysis
integrated with single-cell transcriptome analysis as a novel approach for determining the division, differentiation,
and lineages of individual neural stem cells, as well as the changes inflicted by AD and aging. In our second
aim, we will apply our new technique of multitag labeling of dividing cells to further determine the dynamics of
adult neurogenesis and perturbations introduced by AD and aging. Together, these approaches will provide a
new means of dissecting the perturbations in neurogenesis provoked by aging and AD. Finally, in our third aim,
we will determine how these changes are modified by drugs used in different therapy modalities, using them
here as experimental instruments for further revealing the AD- and aging-induced changes."

The research in this proposal focuses on plant immune perception of bacterial pathogens. Plants possess a
sophisticated innate immune system comprised of germline encoded immune receptors capable of recognizing
all pathogen classes. These immune receptors are structurally similar to their animal counterparts and include
surface localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) as well as intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine rich
repeat (NLR) receptors. Plant immune receptors and downstream signaling nodes are controlled by post-
translational modifications, allowing rapid regulation of the initiation, amplitude, and duration of defense.
Although PRRs and NLRs are structurally distinct and exhibit differences in defense timing and amplitude, they
share significant overlap in posttranslational modification of critical downstream signaling nodes. However, our
data demonstrates that the kinases involved in mediating PRR and NLR responses at key signaling nodes are
distinct. Here, we will investigate mechanisms regulating innate immune signal intensity, signal propagation
and cell specific responses within a leaf. We will analyze the importance of specific protein kinases for
mediating the intensity of NLR-triggered immune responses. We will investigate the role of tandemly arrayed
cysteine rich-receptor like kinases as secondary immune receptors that propagate signals of pathogen
perception. Finally, we will investigate cell specific innate immune responses. This project will train the next
generation of scientists and result in discoveries that lead to a better understanding of how signals of initial
pathogen perception are integrated into an effective defense response within a plant organ."

The Colorado Pulmonary Alcohol Research Collaborative (CoPARC) Resource, centered at the University of
Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (CU Anschutz), provides an essential service for investigators to conduct
clinical and translational research to understand the pathogenesis of alcohol misuse in pulmonary infections
(particularly community-acquired pneumonia, or CAP) and their sequelae. In 2011, CoPARC launched an
infrastructure to obtain and distribute biospecimens and data from otherwise healthy participants with well-
characterized alcohol misuse, and healthy controls, including bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial brushings
obtained by bronchoscopy, and blood. During the last renewal, CoPARC's repertoire expanded to meet
evolving investigator requests, with addition of new biospecimen types (e.g. stool, nasal epithelial brushings),
new clinical data (e.g. assessment of neuromuscular weakness), and new participant cohorts (e.g. inhaled
cannabis users). Expansions provided novel opportunities for studies of the gut-lung brain axis, and dual use
disorders, among others. The last renewal also featured new enrollment of critically ill patients with respiratory
failure and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that often complicates CAP in association with
alcohol misuse. Biospecimens collected from critically ill patients include BAL, tracheal aspirates, serial blood
samples, and stool. Infrastructure was also implemented to longitudinally assess patients who survive critical
illness for up to a year post-discharge to evaluate domains of respiratory, physical, and mental health,
including substance use habits. R24 Supplement funding provided an added opportunity to study critically ill
patients with Coronavirus (COVID)-19. CoPARC has had consistent support from consortia (Emory University,
Louisiana State University, Loyola University Chicago, University of California San Francisco, and University of
Nebraska Medical Center) to enroll participants and patients in parallel who augment the size and
representativeness of CU Anschutz cohorts. For the renewal, CoPARC's long-term objective is to magnify the
utility and impact of existing Resource services based on evolving needs of investigators, under the guidance
of a committed Steering Committee. Aims for CoPARC's renewal include: 1. Generate and diversify the
Resource's biological specimen and data inventory to facilitate research targeting the impact of alcohol misuse
across pulmonary and extra-pulmonary organ axes, based on dynamic and evolving investigator requests. 2.
Expand access to biorepositories and data generated through a) consortia arrangements, and b) new multi-
center clinical research and data networks, whose participants have well-characterized alcohol use habits, to
enable clinical and translational research on a larger scale. 3. Strengthen connections in the pulmonary-alcohol
research community through novel services provided by CoPARC to enhance impactful, collaborative
research, and disseminate Resource content and availability."
10833470,"The long term goal of this project is to improve the quality of life of patients with peripheral artery
disease (PAD) using assistive exoskeletons. PAD is a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis that
significantly reduces blood flow to the lower extremities. Veterans with PAD undergo angioplasty,
proximal bypass, and distal bypass procedures at rates 10 times higher than the general US male population.
Reduced blood flow leads to pain during walking known as claudication. Claudication pain that results
from PAD causes patients to walk less and slower, and lose independence compared with their healthy
counterparts. Our research has identified functional limitations in the walking patterns of claudicating patients,
the most prominent and consistent of which is a deficit of the psterior calf muscles, the ankle plantarflexors, to
generate healthy ankle toruqe and power during walking. A properly designed exoskeleton will allow patients
with PAD to walk longer without pain or walk the distance needed for completing daily activities with less stress
to the affected leg. Before EF can be implemented in patients with PAD, the design must be improved to
increase walking performance and actual patient use. As a first step we propose to determine the effect of EF
on walking performance, focusing on the how EF contributes to changes in the biological ankle torque and
power, energy cost, and calf muscle oxygenation. We will test healthy older adults to ensure and confirm
comfort, decrease risk of injury to the foot and calf, and cultivate high potential for device adoption in patients
with PAD. The EF will then be evaluated in patients with PAD. Healthy older individuals are selected for this
initial phase because like patients with PAD, they produce less push-off torque and power during walking
compared with healthy young; making them an appropriate model for PAD limitations. Our specific aims are:
Aim 1: To determine the levels of EF assistance force level which produce better walking
performance in older subjects.
Aim 2: To determine the levels of EF assistance force which produce better subject-reported preference
in older subjects.
Aim 3: To determine the effect of EF assistance levels on walking performance and subject-reported
preference in patients with PAD. Aims 1 and 2 results will guide the assistance levels tested in this aim.
50 healthy older adults for Aims 1 and 2, and 25 patients with PAD for Aim 3 will be recruited from the Nebraska
and Western Iowa Veterans Affairs’ Medical Center and surrounding Omaha community. Aim 1 will test
seven conditions, including five levels of EF assistance, the EF with no spring and one normal walking
condition. Lower extremity torque and power will be measured using gait biomechanics on the
treadmill for three minutes per condition. Muscle oxygenation will be measured with near infrared spectroscopy
of the calf muscles. A metabolic cart will be used to measure energy cost. Aim 2 will thoroughly assess
subject-reported preference across levels of EF assistance. Visual analog scales, rate of perceived exertion
and pain, and feasibility interviews will provide the comfort and fit, fatigue, and physical activity difficulty of
subjects along with the acceptability, demand, and practicality of the EF. Aim 3 will assess walking
performance, energy cost, muscle oxygenation, and subject reported preference in the same manner as
proposed in Aims 1 and 2, except the treadmill tests will be maximal walking distance tests performed
across two difference testing days. We hypothesize there will be an EF assistance level to satisfy subject-
reported preference and walking performance goals. This proposal will provide essential
fundamental knowledge that will establish EF efficacy and guide prescriptive specifications for EF to
be adopted for use by patients with PAD."

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) neuropathology is largely driven by two pathological AD proteins, tau,
and ß-amyloid (Aß), both of which induce neuronal hyperexcitability and are thought to play a role
in the high comorbidity between AD and epilepsy. Tau load and its regional brain distribution
correlate more closely with cognitive decline than amyloid plaque deposition in both AD and
epilepsy patients, making tau an attractive target for disease modification in both conditions. AD
patients have an increased incidence of epilepsy compared to non-AD patients, and we recently
showed that kindled seizures can exacerbate amyloid pathology, mediated by the mammalian
target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation in an AD mouse model. To address how
neuronal hyperactivity can increase AD pathology, we propose to use a tau seeding approach
using two novel AD mice models to determine the effects of later seizures on the spatiotemporal
accumulation of pathologic tau. We will also test the hypothesis that tau transmissibility in AD
occurs through synaptic activation by adapting a method to permanently label cells activated by
kindled seizures following tau seeding. This will allow us to measure the levels and spatial and
temporal distribution of tau and AD pathology throughout the entire brain, as well as gene and
protein expression at single neuron level. We will also utilize human brain tissue from AD patients
with and without a seizure history, and controls, to validate molecular changes observed in the
mouse models. Finally, given our prior observations regarding the therapeutic effects of
rapamycin, and the hypothesis that tau accumulation and transmission is accelerated by seizures,
we will use the two tau seeding mouse models to assess the therapeutic efficacy of post-seizure
chronic treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin or the antiseizure drug levetiracetam in
attenuating AD progression."

In the Kleiner laboratory we study metabolism, physiology and interactions in microbial symbioses and host-
associated microbiota. For this we combine a diversity of cultivation independent approaches – such as
metagenomics, metabolomics, metaproteomics and single cell imaging – with cultivation-based approaches
including heterologous gene expression, biochemical assays and other in vitro measurements. Our research
has a strong focus on the development of high-resolution mass spectrometry driven metaproteomics for the
large-scale identification and quantification of proteins in host-associated microbiota.
During the next five years, I plan to continue using these approaches to study intestinal microbiota responses
to, and mechanisms of interaction with, external substrates (diet) and host-derived substrates (host compound
foraging). I hypothesize that different dietary protein sources and host-derived compounds will have vastly
different impacts on the microbiota and thus need to be considered when studying the interconnection of diet,
the microbiota, and host health. I propose to use metaproteomics, complemented with metagenomics and
metabolomics, to (1) identify and quantify the substrates that are used and converted by microbiota members
and (2) determine how these substrates impact community composition and functional interactions with other
microbiota members and the host. This research will provide urgently needed insight into the functional
impacts of substrates consumed by gut microbiota by optimizing and deploying novel approaches for the
reproducible, large-scale characterization of host, diet and microbial proteins in the intestinal tract.
My long-term goals are to develop metaproteomic approaches that allow us to quantitatively and reproducibly
determine functional interactions in microbial communities, and to define critical interactions between the
microbiota and dietary proteins that will inform the development of therapeutic interventions. These
approaches will also be powerful tools for studying any disease associated with the human microbiome in and
on different body sites and microbial communities that humans interact with in their environment and that
potentially impact health."

The rapid emergence of novel ideas and technologies is transforming molecular and cellular biology into an
increasingly quantitative and interdisciplinary science, opening additional research avenues but also creating
challenges for graduate training. Meanwhile, increased recognition of the barriers faced by some students has
prompted reevaluation of best practices in graduate education and mentorship. To embrace these new
challenges and opportunities, we propose a new implementation of the Molecular and Cellular Biology
(MCB) training program at the University of Chicago. The primary goals are to train a diverse body of
interdisciplinary molecular and cellular biologists, to arm them with the modern quantitative and
computational skills needed to carry out rigorous and reproducible science, and to prepare them for
success in academia, industry, and other research-related careers.
 The new MCB program will unite an exceptional group of 55 faculty trainers who span a range of
relevant fields and share a deep commitment to graduate training. We request 20 slots to support
trainees from a large pool of highly qualified students belonging mainly to four core graduate programs:
(1) Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, (2) Cell and Molecular Biology, (3) Development,
Regeneration and Stem Cell Biology, and (4) Microbiology. The new MCB program will play a unique role
by integrating interdisciplinary research and training in molecular and cellular biology across these
graduate programs. Building on the success of the previous MCB program, which ends this year, the new
MCB program will serve as an institution-leading driver of innovation and excellence in graduate training.
 MCB trainees will be supported primarily in Years 2 and 3, but they will participate in program
activities from matriculation to graduation. A new quantitative curriculum will provide them with robust,
rigorous, and customizable instruction in statistical and computational data analysis and modeling.
Expansion and enhancement of a previous Research in Progress series will provide MCB trainees with
team-mentored training in scientific communication, and will broaden participation to additional students
in MCB trainers' labs. A division-wide career development program, and a student-run MCB Symposium
featuring MCB alumni, will help students to explore different career paths. The MCB program will promote
excellence in mentorship through required activities that include mentoring compacts and annual faculty
mentorship training. Additional guidance for MCB trainees will be provided by annual meetings with the MCB
program directors. Finally, the MCB program and its participating faculty will promote the recruitment and
retention of an increasingly diverse scientific community through involvement in pipeline, outreach, and bridge
programs, and through participation in graduate admissions and faculty recruitment. Professionally
implemented evaluation tools will guide iterative improvements to the MCB program."

Deep sequencing technologies have revolutionized our understanding of gene expression in the brain. In particular, single
cell RNA sequencing of many brain regions has revealed an incredible diversity of transcriptomically-defined neuronal cell
types. This is true not only for anatomically defined brain regions such as the frontal cortex but also for more discrete
neuronal populations such as those confined to a particular cortical layer. This diversity of transcriptomically specified
neuronal cell types is a major step forward for a central goal of contemporary neuroscience: understanding how neural
circuits composed of specific neuronal cell types regulate behavior. Nevertheless, this diversity in neuronal cell types
immediately raises the question as to how the functional output of a brain region (or discrete neuronal population) is
parcellated among the many transcriptomically-defined neuronal cell types that comprise that region. Despite the
enormous work that has gone into defining these neuronal cell types, their functional relevance remains unclear in most,
if not all, instances. Our proposed project seeks to fill this knowledge gap by focusing on the neurons that comprise the
principal component of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTpr). Our genetically-targeted single nucleus RNA
sequencing of BNSTpr neurons has identified many transcriptomically-defined neuronal cell types, one of which is defined
by its unique expression of the neuropeptide tachykinin 1 (Tac1). We have developed intersectional genetic strategies to
interrogate functionally and anatomically the relevance of the Tac1-expressing BNSTpr neuronal cell type in generating
behavioral output of the BNSTpr. In parallel, our genetic strategies enable us to interrogate the contribution of the
complementary Tac1 non-expressing BNSTpr neuronal cell types to behavioral output of this region. In Aim 1, we will
determine the activity of Tac1-expressing and non-expressing BNSTpr neuronal cell types in freely moving mice using a
genetically encoded calcium indicator in engineered mouse strains. In Aim 2, we will use intersectional optogenetic
actuators to determine the necessity and sufficiency of Tac1-expressing and non-expressing BNSTpr neuronal cell types in
behavior. In Aim 3, we will match the connectivity of the Tac1-expressing neuronal cell type with functional output of its
projection targets; in addition, we will engineer a targeted deletion of Tacr1, the cognate receptor for Tac1, in these
projection targets and test whether Tac1 signaling through Tacr1 in these projection targets is essential for behavioral
output. Together, our project will determine the specific contribution of a particular transcriptomically-defined neuronal
cell type to behavior in contrast to the behavioral output of the region within which it resides.
Health relatedness: The BNSTpr is an integrative center linking sensory input to motor output for social behaviors, and it
is critical for emotional and reproductive health. Many neuro-psychiatric conditions manifest with severe disruptions to
social interactions, but how this occurs is unknown. Our work on a molecularly-specified neuronal cell type within this
complex region has the potential to identify neural circuits whose disruption in disease states alters social behaviors. It
may therefore suggest potential targeted therapeutic or diagnostic applications for neuro-psychiatric illnesses."

 Soil-transmitted helminth infections and diarrhea are responsible for a large burden of morbidity and
mortality among children under 5 years and are associated with increased growth faltering, anemia, impaired
child development, and mortality. The primary public health interventions to prevent enteric infections are
household water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions. However, recent WASH intervention trials
found only modest impacts on enteric infection prevalence in children. Observational studies have found that
children in households with concrete floors have a lower prevalence of diarrhea and soil-transmitted helminth
infection than those in households with soil floors. However, these findings may be strongly confounded by
household wealth. We propose a randomized trial in rural Bangladesh to measure whether installing concrete
floors in households with soil floors reduces child enteric infection. We will randomize 800 eligible households
with pregnant women and install concrete floors before the birth cohort is born. We will collect follow-up
measurements when children are ages 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Our team is comprised of experts in
environmental and infectious disease epidemiology, including Bangladeshi scientists. We have extensive
experience implementing large-scale health intervention trials in Bangladesh and other low resource settings.
Aim 1 is to measure the effect of household concrete floors on household fecal contamination and child soil
contact and ingestion over time. The primary endpoint is Ascaris lumbricoides prevalence at any follow-up
measurement. Secondary endpoints include prevalence of other soil-transmitted helminths and diarrhea. Other
outcomes include maternal quality of life and stress. Aim 2 is to measure the effect of household concrete
floors on household fecal contamination and child soil contact and ingestion over time. We will detect soil-
transmitted helminths (N=800) in floor swabs and E. coli in floor, child hands, and sentinel toy samples in a
random subsample (N=220). In a subsample (N=60), we will conduct video observations to estimate the
frequency of child soil contact and ingestion. We will estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for both
maternal and child outcomes using disability adjusted life years. This trial will determine whether concrete
floors reduce enteric infection, and investigate mechanisms for how floors impact health, or if they do not, why.
Household concrete floors are an innovative potential health intervention that may have additional benefits that
we will measure in this study, including reducing the bandwidth tax that low-income families experience by
making it easier to maintain a hygienic home environment, and in turn improve quality of life. Our findings will
provide rigorous, policy-relevant evidence about whether concrete flooring installation should be delivered as a
public health intervention to reduce child enteric infection. More broadly, this study marks a paradigm shift in
intervention design for improving child health by expanding its scope to include housing improvements."

This R35 proposal builds on experiments supported by a Javits R37 and a U01 CREATE Bio award and the
longstanding success of the principal investigator’s group leading from mechanistic discoveries in
spinocerebellar ataxias and translation to novel treatments, one of which is now in a phase 1 human trial
(BIIB105). The proposal’s unifying theme is a focus on RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in the ATXN2-complex of
proteins that direct several aspects of RNA metabolism and that are prone to phase-separation and
aggregation. Building on our recent discoveries in polyglutamine-mediated neurodegeneration and neuronal
staufen-1 (STAU1) overabundance, we will apply multi-dimensional approaches to define novel pathogenic
mechanisms in their intersections with autophagy, the unfolded protein response (UPR), and with RNA
metabolism and transport. We postulate that these responses, while compensatory in the short term, become
maladaptive with sustained stress and that an RBP network response leads to progressive deterioration of
autophagic flux and amplification of apoptotic signaling. We have established a broad suite of innovative tools
and unique models in an exceptional research environment with established local and national collaborators
with whom we have shared resources over many years. Our approach has been to characterize cerebellar
degeneration at multiple time points using genome-wide transcriptomic, proteomic, morphologic, physiologic
and behavioral techniques. These foundations will allow us to rapidly progress from cellular to animal models
modifying dosage of specific genes in vitro and in vivo. We will now extend this approach from Purkinje cells to
spinal motor neurons enabling us to address fundamental issues of broad relevance to inherited and sporadic
neurodegenerative diseases. These topical issues include: the role of cytoplasmic RBPs, especially ATXN2
and STAU1, in response to nutrient, chemical and mutant protein stress; their regulation and interplay with
each other, and key proteins determining autophagic flux and the UPR; their overall effect on neuronal death;
and finally, their promise as therapeutic targets using small molecules and RNA-directed therapies. R35
funding will allow us to identify novel functions of proteins in the ATXN2-complex in neurodegeneration and
define shared features across different neurodegenerative diseases with particular relevance not only to
inherited, but also to sporadic forms of ataxia and motor neuron disease. The broad scope of our proposed
studies will enable participation of scientists with diverse backgrounds in a laboratory and departmental culture
of inclusivity and diversity. With our established commitment to reproducibility of animal models and gene
targeting approaches, the novel mechanistic insights hold promise for translation into developing novel
treatments for neurodegenerative disorders."

Ovarian cancer (OCa) is the deadliest of all gynecologic cancers in the United States. Despite initial response to
chemotherapy, most OCa patients become resistant and progress to metastatic disease. Long-term prognosis of
OCa is dismal, and new therapeutic strategies are desperately needed to improve OCa patient survival. The rapidly
proliferative OCa cells have a high demand for de novo protein synthesis, which results in an enhanced basal level
of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Indeed ER-stress associated proteins GRP78, PERK, and ATF6 are
overexpressed in OCa compared to normal tissues. ER stress triggers the compensatory unfolded protein response
(UPR), which can either restore homeostasis or activate cell death. We reasoned that the high basal level of ER
stress in OCa represents a critical vulnerability, and drugs that further aggravate this already engaged system in
OCa may exhaust its protective features and contribute to apoptosis induction. Towards that end, we have identified
a first-in-class compound, the oligobenzamide ERX-208, which enhances ER stress in OCa cells but not in
primary epithelial cells. ERX-208 significantly reduced the growth of OCa xenografts, patient-derived explant, and
patient-derived xenografts. Unbiased CRISPR knockdown screens identified the lysosomal acid lipase A (LIPA)
protein as the critical target of ERX-208: knockdown of LIPA abrogates response to ERX-208, while reconstitution
of LIPA restores ERX-208 response. We have shown that the binding of LIPA to ERX-208 is critical for the ability
of ERX-208 to induce ERS and subsequently apoptosis in OCa cells. The objective of this proposal is to conduct
mechanistic studies to identify the precise mechanism of action of ERX-208 in OCa, to optimize the “lead” ERX-
208 analog with improved pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic features and to validate that ERX-208 can
overcome the heterogeneity of OCa. Our overarching hypothesis is that the binding of ERX-208 to LIPA
enhances ERS and induces apoptosis in OCa and targets a critical vulnerability in OCa. Aim1 studies will establish
molecular correlates of ERX-208 in OCa cells using unbiased transcriptomics and proteomics, define
ultrastructurally how ERX-208 binding to LIPA causes ERS/UPR, define specific interactions between ERX-208
and LIPA with unbiased mutagenesis and define LIPA binding partners disrupted by ERX-208 and their effect on
ERS/UPR pathways. Aim 2 studies will use medicinal chemistry approaches to generate few ERX-208 analogs for
enhanced specificity for LIPA, define the maximum tolerated dose, dose-ranging studies for ERX-208, and
determine PK, PD, and toxicity to therapeutic ratios. Aim 3 studies will test the efficacy of ERX-208 in blocking
OCa progression in vivo using clinically relevant orthotopic xenograft, syngeneic mouse models, patient-derived
explant, organoids and patient-derived xenograft models. We believe that our studies will establish a novel
therapeutic strategy (enhancing ERS), novel therapeutic target (LIPA), novel therapeutic agents (ERX-
208/analogs) and the preclinical rationale for further clinical translation for patients with advanced OCa."
10838354,"Many children with developmental language disorder (DLD) have higher-order cognitive deficits (i.e., executive
function, problem solving, and planning) in addition to language impairment. Establishing the relation between
language and cognition is important for our understanding of the nature of DLD and for developing approaches
to improve cognition, which is crucial because higher-order cognitive skills predict later academic and career
success. One possibility is that children with DLD have cognitive deficits because they are less successful
relative to peers with typical language in utilizing self-directed speech (SDS; i.e., speech to oneself) to regulate
their behaviors and thoughts. For example, children with DLD may be less likely to articulate steps while
problem solving or verbally rehearse task rules. As such, language impairment may play a causal role in
higher-order cognitive deficits in DLD via impaired SDS. Sociocultural models suggest that SDS begins as
external regulatory speech from caregivers that children internalize to develop SDS. In this model, expressive
language impairment would negatively affect a child’s ability to produce SDS, and receptive language
impairments would reduce a child’s ability to understand caregivers’ external regulatory speech, which is
central to SDS development. Few studies have examined SDS in DLD, but previous research indicates that
children with DLD have immature SDS relative to typically developing peers. However, there is also promising
evidence that SDS can be trained in children with DLD. Although children with DLD show immature SDS
relative to typical peers, longitudinal research in this area is lacking, making it difficult to determine the
developmental trajectory and discern why children with DLD lag behind typical peers. The first goal of this
research is to document the longitudinal development of SDS in preschoolers with and without DLD in order to
compare the groups in their SDS and planning abilities and to assess the relation between these variables over
time. This goal will be achieved in Study 1 in which preschoolers with and without DLD will complete the Tower
of Hanoi planning task four times over one year. The second goal is to elucidate the effects of SDS on planning
performance in preschoolers with and without DLD. This will be addressed in Study 2 in which preschoolers
with DLD and typical language will complete Tower of Hanoi four times in different experimental conditions that
manipulate (i.e., prevent or encourage) SDS production. If task performance differs across the conditions, it
suggests that planning is affected by increasing or decreasing SDS, supporting a causal relationship between
SDS and cognitive performance. The third goal is to test the predictions of the sociocultural model with respect
to the effects of expressive versus receptive-expressive language deficits on SDS. This goal will be addressed
with data from children with DLD from Studies 1 and 2 by comparing SDS development between children with
expressive language impairment versus those with receptive-expressive impairment. Sociocultural models of
SDS would predict an asymmetry with larger SDS deficits associated with receptive-expressive impairment."

Translation is the endpoint of the central dogma and point of temporal and spatial regulation in
gene expression. Biochemical, biophysical and structural methods have outlined the general
steps of translation, providing a menu of key factors, structures of ribosomes and complexes,
and kinetics for the essential steps of initiation, elongation and termination/recycling.
Nonetheless, the mechanisms of key steps such as initiation, elongation and termination, and
how they are regulated by RNA structures, modification or regulatory proteins remains unclear.
A key challenge is that translation is highly dynamic, involving conformational and compositional
changes throughout and following heterogeneous mechanistic pathways. During prior funding
periods supported by the grants that we will merge in this MIRA, we have developed single-
molecule approaches and reagents that observe translation in real time. We combine these
dynamic methods with cryoEM structures to gain a temporal and detailed mechanistic view of
the process. Our proposed research focuses on key areas translational control: how initiation is
achieved in higher organisms—here the pathway by which a small (40S) ribosomal subunit is
bound to a mRNA and recognizes a start—will be determined in both yeast and humans, and
we will explore how mRNA structure, protein binding and modified nucleotides change the
process. We will investigate how long-range RNA interaction between 5’ and 3’ ends of mRNAs
may be critical for basal translation initiation and its control. In elongation, we will continue to
explore recoding events and co-translational protein folding and develop methods to watch
translation elongation in eukaryotic organisms. We will explore the role of ribosomal
stalling/pausing and eventual shunting into ribosomal quality control pathways. Finally, we will
understand the pathways by which correct stop codons are recognized and ribosomes recycled
and determine how correct vs premature stop codons are distinguished in the nonsense
mediated decay pathway. Our research leverages decades of reagent and methods
development, and a wonderful group of collaborators to explore translational control, and its
central linkage to human health and disease."

Inappropriate antibiotic use for the management of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in ambulatory care
is a major driver of antibiotic resistance and an urgent public health threat. Despite decades of research and
interventions to increase evidence-based care for ARTIs, limited progress has been made. Telehealth visits
(THVs) have the potential to improve ARTI management and antibiotic prescribing by addressing factors that
influence inappropriate care and by implementing an approach that optimizes outcomes across populations.
The shift to care via THVs necessitated during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic has created a climate of
increased acceptability for telemedicine and an important opportunity to address this question. We propose to
leverage the current innovative landscape of expanded use of telehealth to test whether THV approaches for
ARTIs can address drivers of inappropriate care and improve management. We seek to conduct a rigorous
implementation study using a mixed methods approach to develop and evaluate a multisite intervention
designed to improve ARTI care. We will conduct the study in ambulatory healthcare settings from three diverse
healthcare systems with patients of a wide range of racial and ethnic backgrounds, those for whom English is
not their primary language, and those with disparities related to social determinants of health. Our study will
first construct a prediction tool using retrospective data for ARTI encounters (acute sinusitis, pharyngitis,
bronchitis, and viral upper respiratory tract infections) at the three sites. The prediction tool will be used to
identify candidates for ARTI management via THV who are at low risk for poor outcomes. We will incorporate
the tool into the workflow of ambulatory care to optimize appropriate triage to THVs. Second, we will use prior
research by our team and other published data to define factors identified as barriers and facilitators for
inappropriate prescribing for ARTIs. Using that background, materials will be developed to facilitate appropriate
management and to educate patients. Those materials will be created via co-production with providers and
community members. Patient materials will be translated in languages reflective of the patient populations
served and be culturally sensitive. We will next conduct open pilot testing at hospital-based clinics at each of
the three participating healthcare systems to refine the process and materials and get feedback from both
patients and providers for adaptation and improvement. Finally, we will implement the approach across six
sites – the sites where the three open pilots were conducted and three affiliated community practices. We will
study outcomes including antibiotic prescribing, need for follow-up visits and encounters, and patient and
provider satisfaction with the THV, the process, and the medical care. Based on our assessment of outcomes,
including feasibility and sustainability, final materials will be organized into a toolkit for other sites to implement."
10840284,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
RNA-seq is a powerful tool for studying molecular biology. However, without cell sorting (or related techniques),
conventional RNA-seq applied to tissue samples cannot determine gene expression in underlying cell-types.
This is problematic because differential gene expression observed at the tissue level is not necessarily reflected
in underling cell-types, which obscures biological insight. For example, Schmiedel et al. recently applied RNA-
seq to 13 purified blood cell-types from 106 individuals1, which uncovered the molecular basis of sex-specific
differences in immune response. However, this was obscured when they applied RNA-seq to only whole-blood.
Single-cell RNA-seq is the obvious candidate to probe cell-type-specific effects more broadly. However, for most
tissues, single-cell RNA-seq has been restricted to small sample sizes, due to specialized dissociation protocols
and cost. Thus, only bulk-tissue RNA-seq data are available for large sample sizes. Crucially, much of these
bulk data are paired to enormous stores of informative clinical phenotypic data and additional -omics data. These
datasets include large NIH initiatives such as GTEx, TCGA, and All of Us, which have collected data on genetics,
disease status, outcome, drug treatments, ethnicity, sex, and much more. The critical gap is that we cannot
currently study the relationship between cell-type level gene expression and any of these phenotypes.
To overcome this limitation, we will develop computational tools for estimating cell-type-specific differential
expression from bulk RNA-seq data, when a small reference single-cell RNA-seq dataset is available from the
same tissue-type. This will allow us to study the cell-type-specific differences in expression that drive human
phenotypes and diseases, unlocking the tens-of-thousands of bulk RNA-seq samples paired to phenotypic data.
The basis for this research program is a previous study where we developed a method to recover the cell-type-
specific effects of inherited genetic variation on gene expression in bulk breast-tumor RNA-seq data. This method
allowed us to discover a novel breast cancer risk gene—which was obscured using conventional methods.
Here, we posit that a similar mathematical framework can be adapted to recover any cell-type-specific effect
from bulk-tissue RNA-seq. Hence, we can develop specific tools to perform multiple commonly applied analyses
at cell-type-specific resolution from bulk-tissue RNA-seq by leveraging matched single-cell data, including
differential expression, correlative and gene set enrichment analysis.
Finally, new spatial transcriptomics technologies are emerging that enable spatially resolved gene expression to
be measured directly in tissue sections. These platforms quantify gene expression in situ in ~100μm barcoded
spots. Each spot captures a small cluster of cells—akin to a miniaturized bulk-tissue RNA-seq experiment.
Hence, the same abstract mathematical framework can be used to identify effects such as cell-type-specific
spatial variation in gene expression. Computational tools for these data are evolving quickly; thus, this award will
also allow us to develop methods that meet the changing needs of these new gene expression platforms."
10840383,"ABSTRACT
Despite recent progress in immunotherapy (checkpoint blockade and adoptive T cell transfer), most patients
with solid tumors still do not respond or subsequently develop acquired resistance to therapy. Our group and
others have described an immune resistance mechanism mediated by the metabolic dysregulation of
Tryptophan (Trp) catabolism through the Kynurenine (Kyn) - aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway. The
production of Kyn and signaling through the AHR suppresses CD8+ and CD4+ effector T cells and enhances
the generation of immunosuppressive cell types, including FoxP3+CD4+ T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (MDSCs) and M2-polarised tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) - cells which play a
critical role in limiting anti-tumor immunity. We propose to image signaling activity through the IDO/TDO-Kyn-
AHR pathway, in order to optimize the timing (scheduling) of combination drug treatment (treatments targeting
this pathway along with immune based therapies).
In this proposal, we plan to: use imaging to better understand signaling through the Trp–Kyn-AHR pathway in
the tumor microenvironment, by monitoring AHR transcriptional activity using dual reporter systems. We have
successfully developed a DRE (dioxin responsive enhancers)-AHR reporter system in order to: 1) quantify the
kinetics of engagement of the AHR upon in vitro stimulation with different agonists/antagonists and its
correlation with phenotypic changes in different components of the TME: cancer cells, macrophage and T cells;
2); to monitor the dynamic of activation of the AHR pathway in vivo using a biosensor system during tumor
progression in IDO/TDO-expressing cancer models 3) to evaluate the in vivo dynamics of AHR activation after
response to therapeutic interventions (PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade, T cell therapy) in the same models 4) design
therapies combining the inhibition of the Trp-Kyn-AHR axis with immune therapy based on reporter assays of
the AHR activity over time; and 4) evaluate the potential for clinical translation.
This approach addresses an unmet need and the proposed strategy is strongly supported by 4 experts in the
field and our recent publication in Nature Communication– see letters of support."
10838928,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
People living with HIV experience neurologic dysfunction, including encephalitis, depression, anxiety, and
cognitive deficits. Chronic inflammation is a major hallmark of HIV disease today and contributes to the
development of neurologic dysfunction in up to 50% of people living with the virus. These neurologic deficits
result in poorer daily functioning, decreased quality of life, and have become more prevalent due to the survival
benefits of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Thus, chronic inflammation and its consequent effect on neurologic
health represents a major public health issue. Microglia are an integral underlying mediator of this chronic
inflammation through production of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and antiviral responses. Together,
these components promote neuroinflammation that persists despite ART and contributes to neurologic
impairment through demyelination, pruning, and destruction of neurons. There is a pressing need to develop
adjunct therapies to limit deleterious effects on neurologic health. Cannabinoids are emerging as an important
modulator of inflammation. Phytocannabinoids, including cannabidiol (CBD), are known to modulate
inflammation through activation of canonical and extended endocannabinoid system receptors. While
canonical endocannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) are the most well studied, less studied extended
endocannabinoid receptors (TRPV2 and PPAR-a) also possess immune modulating functions. The research
goal of this F31 proposal is to evaluate expression, function, and immunomodulatory potential of
endocannabinoid receptors, and CBD, in microglia in the context of HIV. Our preliminary data determine that
macrophage/microglia express both canonical and extended endocannabinoid receptors. Of note, they express
TRPV2 and PPAR-a more than any other brain cell type, including neurons, astrocytes, endothelial cells, and
pericytes. We determined that endocannabinoid receptor pharmacologic agonists modulate myeloid cell
inflammation following exposure to potent bacterial moiety, lipopolysaccharide, an example of a strong
inflammatory agent. Together, these preliminary data suggest endocannabinoid receptors are present on
myeloid cells and have the capacity to modulate chronic, myeloid derived inflammation. We hypothesize that 1)
CB1, CB2, TRPV2, and PPAR-a are present on macrophage/microglia, are selectively impacted by HIV
infection, and that they 2) mechanistically contribute to modulation of HIV inflammatory responses. We will
systematically test this hypothesis by evaluating the impact of HIV on expression and function of these
receptors. We will also use CBD and agonists to evaluate the mechanistic contribution of receptors to
modulating microglial inflammation. Successful completion of these research goals along with the proposed
mentorship and training provided through this F31 award will propel me forward in accomplishing my long-term
goal of becoming a public health research scientist working at the intersection of HIV and substance use."
10839034,"Abstract
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a major global health challenge. According to UNAIDS data 2020,
approximately 38 million people across the world are living with HIV. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is not able to
clear the viral reservoir, leaving HIV-1 as an uncurable chronic disease. Despite viral suppression by ART, people
living with HIV (PLWH) have increased risks for developing chronic lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, emphysema, asthma, primary lung cancer, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Previous
studies have demonstrated that chronic lung inflammation predisposes PLWH to pulmonary complications.
Efforts to better understand the mechanisms underlying HIV-related lung diseases are needed. The lung
microbiome (i.e., a collection of all bacteria residing in the airway) plays a significant role in modulating lung
immunity and disease pathogenesis. Accumulating evidence has supported that PLWH on suppressive ART
harbor an altered lung microbiome compared to people without HIV infection. The enrichment of bacteria in the
genera of Prevotella spp., Veillonella spp., and Streptococcus spp. in the PLWH may contribute to chronic lung
inflammation. Human population-based lung microbiome studies have been mostly cross-sectional. They are
confounded by genetic and environmental factors and lack mechanistic insights. Longitudinal studies monitoring
the dynamics of lung inflammation and microbial alterations are needed to understand the crosstalk between
dysregulated immune pathways and lung microbial dysbiosis during HIV infection. Here we propose to use an
advanced humanized mouse model to better understand lung inflammation and microbial dysbiosis driven by
HIV infection. We have two specific aims to perform. Specific Aim 1 is to characterize the dynamics of lung
microbial alterations and immune perturbations at cellular and transcriptional levels in humanized mice from the
acute to chronic infection stages. We will also investigate how ART influence lung immunity and lung microbiome.
Specific Aim 2 is to examine the role of lung bacterial dysbiosis on the lung immune system and develop novel
approaches to reduce or resolve lung inflammation. We expect that our results will provide novel insights into
the crosstalk between pulmonary immune tone and the microbiome in the context of HIV infection and pave the
way for further mechanistic studies to better understand HIV-associated lung complications."

In this U54, we propose to establish an HPV/HIV-Associated Malignancy Research Center
(HAMRC) as a partnership of institutions and investigators in Rwanda, the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC) and the United States (US), with an integrated, trans-disciplinary focus on
HIV/HPV-associated malignancies. The HAMRC is planned to have a coordinated and
integrated program of research and capacity-building (Developmental Core) in HPV-related
cancers in PLWH. The aim of the Developmental Core is to develop a cadre of junior and mid-
level researchers who will utilize the resources developed by the Center to catalyze research in
HPV/HIV-associated malignancies in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
This development of junior and mid-level researchers will be done through an apprenticeship
model in which they are paired with an experienced investigator in the development and
execution of a research protocol or a pilot project. Mentoring will be individually tailored for each
trainee, building on his or her prior training, research experience, interests and research
projects. In addition, a peer-reviewed pilot grants program will be utilized to stimulate
development of research projects specifically in HPV/HIV associated cancers. The
Developmental Core will be led by three African investigators who are all independently funded
researchers, thus, providing the ESIs with role models who have navigated challenges similar to
their own and strong examples to follow/learn from. In addition to the Core Directors, a team of
mentors will work with the trainees in the major research projects and potential pilot projects"
10851921,"Abstract:
 Cervical cancer is the 4th most common cancer and cause of cancer-related death in women globally; in
many lower-resource settings, especially sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), it is the most common. Virtually all
cervical cancer and precancer are caused by high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV). HPV16 causes ~55-
60% and HPV18 causes ~10-15% of cervical cancer while the remaining ~12 HPV types cause the remaining
25-30% of cervical cancer. hrHPV, predominately HPV16, also causes most anal, vulvar, vaginal, and penile
cancers and a significant proportion of oropharyngeal cancers. Prophylactic HPV vaccines have been
developed and have shown to be nearly 100% protective against incident infection and related abnormalities
against the target HPV types in the general population. However, the evidence for the effectiveness of
prophylactic HPV vaccines in women living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (WLWH) is less clear.
HIV infection increases the risk of cervical cancer due to an impaired immune response to HPV.
 In 2011, Rwanda, a high-burden cervical cancer country in East Africa that has an HIV prevalence in
adult women of 3.3%, implemented a national HPV vaccination program with Gardasil®, which protects
against HPV16 and HPV18, the two HPV types that cause ~70% of cervical cancer, and HPV6 and HPV11,
the two types that cause ~90% of anogenital warts (HPV6/11/16/18). Their program has achieved >90%
coverage of the target population, primarily girls aged 12 years, annually. The implementation of a highly
successful HPV vaccination program and the high prevalence of HIV, in addition to the research and medical
capacity that Albert Einstein College of Medicine (Einstein) has helped to build at the Rwanda Military Hospital
(RMH) and University of Rwanda (UR), makes Rwanda the ideal locale to study the long-term effects of HPV
vaccination in WLWH.
 To answer questions about HPV vaccine effectiveness and immunity in Rwanda WLWH, collaborators
at Einstein, RMH, and UR will conduct an observational study of WLWH and HIV-negative (HIV[-]) women who
did (birth cohorts 1997 and later) and WLWH did not receive HPV vaccination (birth cohorts before 1997). We
will compare the cervical, anal, and oral prevalent and 6-month persistent HPV6/11/16/18 infections in 757
HPV-vaccinated WLWH to those in 757 unvaccinated WLWH. We will also compare the HPV immune
response in 548 HPV-vaccinated WLWH to 548 HPV-vaccinated HIV[-] women and the impact of switching
from 3 doses to 2 doses of Gardasil in 2015. We also will validate a low-cost, simple point-of-care test for
HPV16 antibodies as method to verify/determine HPV vaccination status. Finally, we will investigate the risk
factors, including the cervicovaginal microbiome, for HPV persistence in WLWH. Our (long-term) goal is to
establish a cohort of WLWH in whom we can examine the long-term effectiveness of HPV vaccination in
WLWH now and in the future. This contribution is significant as it will establish the population effectiveness of
HPV vaccination in WLWH living in SSA, the women at the highest risk of cervical cancer, for which there is a
dearth of evidence. The proposed research is innovative as it leverages and expands the local research and
medical capacity in Rwanda to examine one of the critically unanswered questions about HPV vaccine
effectiveness in the context of the World Health Organization call for the global control of cervical cancer."
10851923,"Abstract:
 High-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) cause virtually all cervical cancer, most anal, vulvar, vaginal,
and penile cancer, and a significant proportion of oropharyngeal cancer. Men who have sex with men (MSM) are
at an elevated risk of anal cancer because of high-risk behaviors for acquiring HPV, and those living with HIV
(MSM-LWH), are at the highest risk of anal cancer due to also having an impaired immune response to HPV.
Understanding the prevalence and incidence of anogenital HPV infection and precancerous lesions and their
associated risk factors in at-risk populations is particularly important since, unlike most other cancers, HPV-
related cancers are likely preventable. Prevention of these cancers may be accomplished through primary
prevention (vaccination) or potentially through secondary prevention by identifying and treating precancerous
lesions.
 In general, little is known about the prevalence and incidence of anal and penile HPV infection, and
anal and penile squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) among MSM who live in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We
previously completed a study of HPV in Rwandan MSM and surprisingly found an unexpected low prevalence
of anal HPV and no difference in anal HPV prevalence between MSM-LWH and HIV-uninfected (HIV[-]) MSM.
We propose to continue our investigations of anal and penile HPV in MSM by conducting a complementary
study in MSM living in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). We hypothesize that Congolese MSM are
likely to have higher hrHIV prevalence than do Rwandan men because of different cultural and sexual
practices. The proposed study is designed to provide data on the prevalence and incidence of anal and penile
HPV infection and HPV-associated lesions at these anatomic sites, and to describe associated risk factors for
Congolese MSM, and compare these findings to those in our prior MSM study in Rwanda.
 After conducting formative research to reach the target MSM population and build local capacity to
conduct the proposed research in DRC, we will enroll and follow 300 Congolese MSM, 150 MSM-LWH and
150 HIV[-] MSM, every 6 months for 18 months, as we did for the first 18 months of our Rwanda study.
Moreover, we will extend our follow-up of the Rwandan MSM cohort to for two additional years to assess
incidence of precancerous lesions. We will measure current HPV infections using a low-cost, robust HPV
genotyping system that we have already introduced into Rwanda and will, as part of this grant, introduce into
DRC, and past exposures by measuring anti-HPV antibodies circulating in the blood. We will also measure the
anal microbiome to determine whether certain microbiotic environments influence the anal HPV natural history
as they seem to for cervical HPV.
 Our (long-term) goal is to establish a cohort of MSM in both countries to study the natural history of
anal and penile HPV in MSM living in SSA. This contribution is significant as it will establish the extent of
exposure to HPV and at what ages, which can be used to guide policy on what age to target MSM for
prophylactic HPV vaccination. The proposed research is innovative as it leverages and expands the local
research and medical capacity in Rwanda and DRC, and creates a south-south collaboration, to conduct a
state-of-the-art natural history of anal and penile HPV and related abnormalities, and their corresponding risk
factors, which is poorly described in MSM-LWH and HIV[-] MSM living in SSA."

10852839,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pediatric severe obesity (defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥1.2 times the 95th percentile or BMI ≥35 kg/m2) is
the fastest growing obesity category, affecting ~6% of youth in the U.S. Youth with severe obesity are at
significant risk for developing obesity-related health consequences including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular
disease. Obesity pharmacotherapy is a promising adjunct to lifestyle modification (LSM) therapy for severe
pediatric obesity treatment, as LSM alone generally fails to result in clinically significant and durable weight loss
and metabolic/bariatric surgery is invasive, carries surgical risks, and is not widely available. While obesity
pharmacotherapies are associated with overall mean weight loss, there is substantial variability in their individual-
level effectiveness. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has recognized the importance of identifying
phenotypic characteristics associated with medication responsiveness, using pharmacogenomics approaches
to develop precision pharmacologic treatments, and optimizing medication dosing based upon a person’s
characteristics, in order to improve treatment of pediatric severe obesity. The objective of this proposal is to
utilize techniques that can be used in precision medicine to identify person-specific characteristics associated
with weight loss response to and affecting dosing of obesity pharmacotherapies. Specifically, we will use (1)
electronic health record (EHR)-enabled clinical discovery to identify phenotypic characteristics predicting weight
loss response, (2) genetic risk scores to determine the role genetic susceptibility plays in weight loss response,
and (3) pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling to begin identifying individualized dosing
regimens of obesity pharmacotherapies in youth with severe obesity. We will be applying these techniques to
topiramate, a medication commonly prescribed for weight loss in youth with severe obesity that has been
associated with highly variable individual-level effectiveness. This project will generate critical preliminary data
to inform the design of an R01 evaluating predictors of response to topiramate and other obesity
pharmacotherapies in youth with severe obesity, including agents that are currently (e.g., glucagon-like peptide-
1 (GLP1) receptor agonists) and will be (e.g., glucagon-GLP1 co-agonists, sodium glucose co-transporter 2/1
inhibitors) available in the future. Completing this K23 training program will allow me to establish skills in EHR-
enabled clinical discovery and applying genetic risk scores and PK/PD modeling to clinical research that I will
need in order to become a leader in the field of precision medicine for obesity management. Further, the
multidisciplinary mentorship that I will receive during this career development award will prepare me to become
an extramurally funded physician scientist capable of implementing both independent and collaborative large-
scale clinical studies."
10853078,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Background: Widely sharing patient data and biospecimens can enable life-saving advances in
translational science. Hospitals and commercial entities focusing on precision medicine and
other genetic and artificial intelligence technologies have increasingly partnered to share these
data resources. To ensure equitable access to scientific advances, datasets must include
patients reflecting the demographic distribution of disease. However, our previous research
demonstrates that many patients are uncomfortable with hospitals sharing their data with
industry and that individuals who identify as Black or Hispanic are consistently more likely to
report discomfort. We need to measure diverse patient responses to actual hospital data-
sharing practices with the power to differentiate preferences across race, ethnicity, and other
relevant scales to identify promising areas for compromise with an equitable impact. Approach:
The goal of this proposal is to identify areas for compromise between patients and hospitals to
improve data-sharing practices with industry in ways that are respectful of individual patient
autonomy and equitable in impact across diverse communities. Research Aims: To achieve
this goal, our project has three specific aims: (1) Explore hospital data-sharing policies and
practices with commercial entities, and their industry and patient relationships, (2) Characterize
the kinds of hospitals that have been approached by, are interested in, and/or have shared
patient data with industry and measure the kinds of patient impact that might drive change to
specific data-sharing practices, and (3) Examine the acceptability of hospital data-sharing
practices, preferences amongst acceptable practices, and anticipated impact of unacceptable
practices generally as well as by race and ethnicity specifically. Impact: Patient discomfort with
hospital data sharing practices that patients find unacceptable – and its association with race
and ethnicity – is a significant problem for increasing the accessibility and generalizability of
translational science advances. Though our mixed methods ELSI approach to discovering areas
for compromise between hospitals and patients, while centering those historically excluded, this
proposal will have a major impact on improving data-sharing practices to facilitate diversity in
data used to support high-impact translational science."
10852989,"Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC) is a liver cancer that primarily affects adolescents and young
adults. There are no known successful therapies for this disease and surgery is the only potential path to a cure.
Once the disease has grown or metastasized to a point where surgery is no longer an option, a patient’s chance
for survival approaches zero. Unfortunately, 65% of patients are diagnosed at stage IV.
Our lab identified a recurrent genetic deletion in FLC cells, which has been found in almost all FLC tumor samples
sequenced to date, but not in normal liver tissue from the same patients. The deletion encompasses ~400kb on
chromosome 19 beginning after the first exon of DNAJB1, which codes for a member of the heat shock protein
40 (HSP40/DNAJ) family, and ends before the second exon of PRKACA, which codes for the catalytic subunit
of protein kinase A (PRKACA). This results in a functioning chimeric kinase with exon 1 of DNAJB1 and exons
two through ten of PRKACA (DNAJB1-PRKACA). We have shown that expression of this chimeric protein, but
not the native kinase, in the liver of mice results in the formation of phenotypic FLC and lethal tumors. This
strongly supports the notion that the DNAJB1-PRKACA chimera is the primary driver for this cancer. We have
shown that the structure of the catalytic site of the native and fusion kinases are almost identical and it has been
difficult to find blockers that selectively inhibit the fusion kinase.
The goal of this research proposal is to develop a therapeutic for this devastating disease utilizing antisense and
shRNA technology. This approach will allow us to specifically target the nucleotide sequence encompassing the
junction of the fusion transcript, without affecting any of the native transcripts. Our approach is to 1) screen
antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and shRNA with sequences that span this junction in an attempt to find the
ASO or shRNA that results in the greatest knockdown of chimeric protein; 2) assess the effects of these ASOs
and shRNA on the viability of FLC cells in vitro; 3) assess the efficacy of the ASO and shRNA to cause
knockdown of the protein in the tumor cells in FLC patient-derived xenografts growing in mice; 4) assess the
effects of the ASO and shRNA on the health of the mice, with a particular attention to liver toxicity, and 5) assess
the efficacy of the ASO and shRNA to reduce tumor burden in mice."
10853098,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 The opioid crisis was declared a public health emergency in 2017. It has led to an
increased incidence of opioid overdose, injection substance use, and, eventually, HIV
transmission. More than 171,000 people in the United States are living with HIV as a result of
substance use disorder (SUD). Despite the known fact that both HIV and SUD significantly
disturbs both innate immunity and adaptive immunity, their underlying molecular mechanisms,
and interplay to immune dysfunction remain unexplored. Comprehensive functional
characterization at a single-cell resolution is essential to provide new molecular insights and
discover therapeutic targets.
 Recent advances in novel sequencing technologies and community efforts to share
genomic data provide unprecedented opportunities to understand the molecular dynamics of
immune dysfunction up HIV infection and SUD. This application describes the development of
integrative strategies and machine learning methods to combine novel assays (such as STARR-
seq) with high-dimensional, multi-scale genomic profiles to elucidate the transcriptional,
epigenetic, and network alterations and to key immune dysfunction drivers associated with HIV
and SUD. Specifically, we will (1) Integrate novel functional genomics assays with single-cell
multi-omics data to construct cell-type-specific multi-modal gene regulatory network (GRNs) in
healthy individuals, (2) build a comprehensive immune profiling data hub for HIV/SUD-affected
individuals and construct disease- and cell-type-specific GRNs, (3) uncover how key network
changes and aberrant behaviors of TFs upon HIV infection and/or SUD can lead to immune
dysfunction. Distinct from existing efforts focusing on transcriptome analyses, this proposed work
presents a genuinely novel big-data approach for both modeling gene regulation and investigating
disease-risk factors by incorporating heterogeneous multi-omics profiles at a single-cell resolution.
The resultant comprehensive list of cis-regulatory elements at a single-cell resolution will expand
the number of known functional regions. The constructed immune cell atlas, GRNs, and identify
key drivers of immune dysfunction will be accessible to the public via web services and annotation
databases. Our integrative computational efforts will be released distributed open-source
programs. Altogether, our released resource will accelerate research in the broader scientific
community by providing essential tools to investigate immune function, which will benefit other
investigators exploring the genetic underpinnings of immune system function of HIV and/or SUD."
10850149,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Translational repression and reactivation play critical roles in the development and homeostasis of multicellular
organisms. These processes have been best studied in oocytes, which are often generated but not fertilized for
weeks, months or even years. Studies of Xenopus oocytes have shown that translational repression and
reactivation of at least some mRNAs involves removal of the mRNA polyA tail and coupling with proteins for
storage, followed by regeneration of the polyA tail for translational reactivation after egg activation by
progesterone. The TENT2 family of non-canonical polyA polymerases has been linked to this process in
Xenopus as well as in other animals. In Drosophila melanogaster, mRNAs must also be translationally
repressed and reactivated during spermatogenesis. Our preliminary data shows that a member of a different
family of non-canonical polyA polymerases, TENT5 is required for spermatogenesis in Drosophila
melanogaster. TENT5 family members have been linked to spermatogenesis in mice and humans as well, but
the mechanisms are unknown. In D. melanogaster, as in vertebrates, spermatogenesis occurs in a syncytium
through meiosis and most of spermatid differentiation. We have generated a strong loss-of-function CRISPR-
Cas9 allele, TENT52-83 that affects the end of spermatogenesis, after meiosis, when the spermatids become
separated into individual cells, a process termed spermatid individualization. In this proposal, we describe our
plans to define the role of D. melanogaster TENT5 in spermatid individualization. In Aim 1, we will use in situ
hybridizations to determine the TENT5 expression pattern in the testes and use Gal4/UAS-based approaches
to knock down TENT5 in the germline or the soma. This approach will allow us to determine in which cell type
TENT5 is required. In addition, we will attempt to rescue the TENT52-83 phenotype with wild type and catalytic-
dead versions of TENT5, to determine if TENT5 requires its polyA polymerase catalytic domain for its role. In
Aim 2, we will examine the localization of proteins with known roles in spermatid individualization, whose
mRNAs might be targets of TENT5 polyadenylation. We will use established techniques to pinpoint the stage
at which TENT52-83 affects spermatid individualization. The results of these analyses are expected to lay the
groundwork for future studies to confirm TENT5 targets with single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridizations
and co-staining with TENT5 protein, as well as RNA immunoprecipitation, for instance, that will define the
mechanism by which TENT5 proteins function in spermatogenesis, including potentially in humans."

Transcription is a fundamental cellular process whose proper regulation is essential to establishment and
maintenance of healthy cell states. As with many regulatory processes in the cell, transcription is now
understood to involve the dynamic formation and dissolution of large assemblies of protein and RNA
molecules called biomolecular condensates. Our research program is focused on three goals at the
intersection of transcription and condensates that we believe will provide important new insights into gene
regulation and fill important gaps in our understanding of condensates and their regulation. Goal 1) We will
test the hypothesis that many long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate transcriptional condensates at
nearby genes. Condensates are formed by an ensemble of low-affinity molecular interactions and RNA can
be a powerful regulator of condensate dynamics. Thousands of lncRNA species are expressed in any one
cell type, but the functions of the vast majority of these RNA molecules are not known. Most lncRNAs are
transcribed within 10kb of protein coding genes and appear to accumulate at those loci, suggesting that
many of these RNAs function to tune the expression of local protein coding genes by affecting the
dynamics of local condensate formation and dissolution. Goal 2) We will test the hypothesis that
condensate immiscibility contributes to the functional separation of active and silent chromatin. The nuclear
architecture of a cell involves transcriptionally active and inactive compartments, and current evidence
indicates that the two compartments form separate condensates. We have observed that condensates
formed by regulators of active and silent genes are immiscible and postulate that this property contributes
to the functional separation of active and inactive compartments in the nucleus of mammalian cells. Goal 3)
We will explore the physicochemical environments of nuclear condensates with the goal of determining the
types of chemistries that distinguish diverse condensates. A major issue in condensate biology is the
extent to which the chemical environments of diverse condensates enable biological specificity. Our
evidence indicates that small molecules can be used to probe the internal chemical environment that
governs the behavior of condensates and thus teach us about the internal chemistry of diverse
condensates that may enable biological specificity. This information may also provide insights into the
chemical features that selectively concentrate small molecules in specific condensates, which may enable
future advances in drug design for targets that reside in specific condensates. While conducting these
studies, we will continue to identify protein and RNA components of euchromatic and heterochromatin
condensates and to invest in assays of condensate dynamics and transcriptional output. We will also
continue to train and mentor diverse young scientists in an environment that facilitates collaboration with
leading experts in biochemistry, chemistry and physics."

 2 Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death in women in the US. Women differ from men in
 3 rates and timing of CVD and show a stronger association between CVD and metabolic syndrome. This
 4 difference suggests that gender-specific factors may moderate the underlying pathophysiology of CVD. We
 5 propose that lactation could be one such women-specific factor. Multiple observational studies have linked
 6 breastfeeding with reduced maternal cardiometabolic disease later in life; however, the underlying mechanisms
 7 for the beneficial effect of lactation remain unknown. Our central hypothesis is that high levels of oxytocin
 8 produced during lactation protect breastfeeding mothers against cardiovascular diseases later in life.
 9 We were the first to report significantly lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure; less adipose tissue; better
10 cardiac ejection fraction, output, and diastolic function; and lower concentrations of circulating cardiovascular
11 risk markers in mice that lactated compared to mice that did not lactate. Oxytocin (OXT) is a neuropeptide that
12 triggers uterine contractions, the milk let-down reflex during lactation, and plays a central role in maternal
13 behavior and social affiliation. OXT in physiological situations, such as pregnancy and lactation, induces its
14 own synthesis and release. In our model, we found significantly increased circulating OXT levels and mRNA
15 expression in mice that lactated. The objective of this study is to further define the mechanisms affecting
16 maternal cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes after lactation-induced OXT production. We will test 3
17 hypotheses: 1) OXT-stimulating events during lactation – suckling and maternal-pup interaction – are required
18 for dams to develop maternal cardioprotective phenotype later in life; 2) that higher levels of OXT in
19 postpartum lactated mice is a result from activation of central OXT-OXTR system; 3) administration of
20 exogenous OXT to nonlactating mice in the immediate post-delivery period will rescue the cardioprotective
21 phenotype with or without pre-existing chronic disease. Aim 1 is designed to mimic the bottle-feeding situation
22 in non-breastfeeding women; we will use mice with their nipples surgically removed. In Aim 2 we will use
23 conditional knockout mice (flox-Cre recombinase system) that are Oxtr deficient in the brain. In Aim 3 the
24 hypothesis will be tested in obesity-hypertension model. Longitudinal in vivo experimental procedures will
25 include measuring fasting glucose and blood pressure, and assessing cardiac function with echocardiogram
26 and adipose tissue using micro-computed micrography. In vitro, we will utilize organ explant and vascular
27 reactivity studies. In summary, our proposal will define the mechanisms by which lactation affects maternal
28 health later in life and quantify the causal effect of breastfeeding on maternal cardiovascular and metabolic
29 health. The results of our study may lead to further mechanistic explorations of the role of lactation in maternal
30 health, which could be directly translated into interventions to prevent CVD in women."

The quest for an HIV cure remains incomplete, nearly half a century since the onset of the epidemic.
Antiretroviral drug cocktails can suppress HIV infection, but suffer in their success owing to side effects
and limitations in access and compliance. Injection of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) to
prevent HIV rebound has had some success, but requires regular re-injection of multiple antibodies to
maintain suppression and viral escape. Thus, cost and continued access remain limitations. Genetic
engineering of patient cells has been proposed to overcome all of these shortfalls, and could constitute
a one-time treatment with lifelong therapeutic value if successful. In this proposal, we leverage a novel
approach developed by Dr. Justin Taylor’s laboratory to genetically engineer B cells to express bNAbs
for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This strategy has already been used to
engineer B cells to produce antibodies protective against influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus,
Epstein-barr virus and HIV [Moffett et al., Science Immunology, 2019]. While this approach can ensure
protective antibody production, the genetic engineering process required 10 days of complicated ex
vivo manufacturing and is not broadly distributable. To overcome these barriers, we will co-opt a novel,
synthetic nanoparticle that was developed in Dr. Jennifer Adair’s laboratory to deliver genetic
engineering in a single, passive step [Shahbazi et al., Nature Materials, 2019]. We show that this
nanoparticle can be assembled in less than a day to genetically engineer unstimulated, primary human
blood cells and can be modified to specifically interact with target blood cell types in vivo. Here we will
develop this scalable nanoformulation as a vaccine-like in vivo delivery system to direct humoral
immunity with multiple bNAbs in a clinically-relevant nonhuman primate model of HIV infection. We will
use these nanoparticles to directly genetically engineer native primary B cell subtypes, and
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, which can provide lifelong replenishment of antibody-
producing B cells. This research will not only develop a unique tool set against HIV but will provide
transformative advances in equitable distribution of gene editing therapies."

 Although the critical roles Hox genes play in establishing skeletal morphology has been known for
decades, virtually nothing is understood regarding the molecular mechanisms by which Hox genes function in
the skeleton. Utilizing a unique collection of genetic tools that permit live visualization of Hox expression
(Hoxa11eGFP), Cre-mediated lineage labeling and/or conditional deletion (HoxCreERT2, Hoxd11LoxP/LoxP) and
assessment of Hox11 chromatin binding sites (unpublished, validated Hoxa113XFLAG and Hoxd113XFLAG alleles),
the overall objective of this application is to dissect the pathways and targets regulated by Hox transcription
factors in skeletal stem/progenitor cells to regulate osteogenic and chondrogenesis differentiation. Previous
work has demonstrated that Hox-expressing stem/progenitors are maintained in the skeleton in the absence of
Hox function, and osteo- and chondrogenic lineages continue to emerge (Sox9-, Osx-/Runx2-expressing), but
differentiation is incomplete. Osteoblasts do not progress to mature stages, and chondrocytes fail to undergo
normal apoptosis and replacement by bony matrix in Hox mutants. This differentiation defect can be
recapitulated in vitro. Based on previously published work and preliminary data, the central hypothesis is that
Hox transcription factors regulate critical downstream events at the top of the hierarchy during
osteochondrogenic differentiation from skeletal stem/progenitor cells in parallel with canonical differentiation
factors. This project will utilize the Hoxa11eGFP reporter and Hoxa11CreERT2-mediated lineage labeling in the
presence and absence of adult conditional deletion of Hoxd11 to probe the single cell trajectories of Hox11-
expressing progenitors as they expand and differentiate into cartilage and bone in response to injury (Aim 1).
The recapitulation of osteo- and chondrogenic differentiation defects in Hox11 mutants in vitro permits a
comparative assessment of differential gene expression during temporally controlled differentiation (Aim 2).
Newly generated and validated Hoxa113XFLAG; Hoxd113XFLAG epitope-tagged alleles will be utilized to interrogate

research proposal is innovative in its use of sophisticated genetic tools generated by the research team, the
combined in vivo and in vitro approaches, and critical inclusion of a co-investigator and her team with
biostatistics expertise. The proposed research is significant as it addresses the longstanding and highly
significant question of the molecular mechanism of Hox function in the skeleton. As Hox expression is only
observed in skeletal stem/progenitors and early differentiation markers initiate as cells exit the Hox lineage,
dissecting the downstream targets and pathways regulated by Hox that are critical to complete successful
osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation will provide impactful new knowledge of skeletal biology."

treatment, periodontal bone regeneration rarely, if ever, occurs, while molecular mechanism underlying
retarded bone regeneration is largely unknown. This RO1 application proposes to exploit the
osteoimmunological roles of osteoclast (OC)-specific cell membrane receptor, Osteoclast Stimulatory
Transmembrane Protein (OCSTAMP) and Dendritic Cell-Specific Transmembrane Protein (DC-STAMP) in
retarded bone regeneration in periodontitis. During osteoclastic bone resorption, osteoblast (OB)-activation
molecules, such as insulin-like growth factor (IGF), act as “coupling” factors released from demineralized bone
matrix to ensure that the same amount of bone resorbed by OC is replaced by differentiation and activity of
OB. Strong evidence suggests that this coupling mechanism is interrupted (‘uncoupled’) in periodontitis where
pathogenic bone resorption exceeds reparative bone formation, resulting in retardation of bone regeneration.
Our preliminary results showed that P. gingivalis may be engaged in retarded bone regeneration in
periodontitis. A recent study reported that Semaphorin4D (Sema4D) produced by OC inhibits IGF-mediated
osteogenesis by OB. The upstream molecular event(s) that induce(s)/upregulate(s) Sema4D expression by
RANKL-activated osteoclast precursors (OCp), as well as the mechanism of Sema4D action on OB in the

Furthermore, periodontal pathogen, P. gingivalis, appears to upregulate the Sema4D production from OCp by
upregulating the generation of OCSTAMP ligand. Based on these preliminary findings and published evidence,

10854815,"Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in the US. To detect DR, individuals with
diabetes are instructed to receive annual eye exams until visible retinopathy such as hemorrhages or
aneurysms appear that often take years to develop. Even so, treatment is only provided when visually
threatening disease is detected. Our group and others have established that in people with diabetes, retinal
neuronal dysfunction precedes clinically visible retinopathy. Non-invasive recordings of retinal function using
the electroretinogram (ERG) have shown dysfunction with diabetes, particularly in the oscillatory potentials
(OPs) that are generated by inner retinal neurons. A fundamental gap in our knowledge of DR pathology is
whether neuronal dysfunction is associated with or causal to the late stage vascular defects. Our overall
hypothesis is that neuronal defects precede vascular defects in DR and that treating neuronal deficits
early in DR will prevent late stage vascular defects that result in vision loss.
 Dopamine, a key neuromodulator in the retina, is reduced in DR. We demonstrated that treating rodent
models of diabetes with levodopa, a dopamine precursor, is neuroprotective for neuronal dysfunction.
Importantly, we also showed that in patients with diabetes and retinal dysfunction, but without retinopathy,
levodopa taken for only 2 weeks restored retinal dysfunction to normal levels. Thus, our preliminary data
suggest that earlier screening and treatment are possible to prevent or delay retinal dysfunction in early DR.
Since current clinical management of DR is directed at more advanced stages of disease when vascular
defects are present, it is critical to determine if levodopa will also prevent vascular pathology.
 We propose the following specific aims to investigate the link between neuronal and vascular defects in
DR by using neuronal (dim flash ERG) and vascular (fundus photography and optical coherence tomography
angiography) primary outcome measures:
 Aim 1: Investigate whether the appearance of early neuronal dysfunction predicts late stage
vascular pathology in diabetes. We propose follow-up testing on a cohort of participants with diabetes, and
normal or delayed OPs, from a prior clinical study to determine how many develop signs of retinal vascular
defects after 3-5 years.
 Aim 2: Determine whether levodopa treatment initiated at detection of retinal dysfunction will
prevent retinal dysfunction and vascular defects. We will conduct a randomized clinical trial with levodopa
versus placebo using participants with diabetes and confirmed OP delays from two groups: 1) without
retinopathy and 2) with the earliest signs of DR (microaneurysms). Patients will receive levodopa or placebo
twice daily for 6- or 24-months. For the 6-month duration, testing will be done at baseline, 3 months and 6
months. Patients will then return to routine standard of care and be re-tested at 12 and 24 months. For the 24-
month duration, testing will be done at baseline and every 3 months until 24 months. Participants will be
carefully monitored for levodopa side effects with the assistance of a neurologist.
 Determining the association between neuronal and vascular defects in DR is critical to shifting clinical
practice toward early diagnostic markers, a move that could transform the way DR is monitored and treated,
ultimately leading to better preservation of normal visual function."
10854816,"Objectives. Substance use disorder (SUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently co-occur
and having one condition worsens the course of the other. Individuals with both disorders exhibit worse
functioning across a number of domains than individuals with either disorder alone. This is especially true in
residential settings where both disorders are more severe than outpatient settings. Compared to Veterans with
a single disorder, Veterans with SUD/PTSD also are more likely to have suicidal ideation and to have
attempted suicide. Examining treatable conditions that are associated with improved SUD and PTSD
outcomes, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), can maximize treatment efficacy for Veterans at a critical
time in recovery.
 OSA is highly comorbid with both PTSD and SUD with upwards of 67 to 83% of Veterans with SUD or
PTSD also having OSA. Further, untreated OSA is associated with worse functional impairment across
multiple domains, worse quality of life, worse PTSD, and higher substance use and relapse rates. Importantly,
untreated OSA also contributes to higher suicide attempts and completion. Positive airway pressure (PAP) is
the gold standard treatment for OSA with large effects on multiple domains of functioning, quality of life, PTSD
symptoms, physical functioning, lower depression, and better emotional coping. Unfortunately, screening and
treating Veterans for OSA is not a part of clinical practice for SUD or PTSD treatment; as such the average
wait time for individuals to get PAP therapy is upward of two years. Despite the widespread dissemination of
knowledge regarding the detrimental effects of untreated OSA and the incredible effectiveness of PAP
treatment, OSA is rarely screened for or treated in patients with SUD or PTSD, with approximately 80% to 90%
of Veterans with OSA remaining undiagnosed and untreated.
 Methodology. We aim to examine the effects of PAP treatment on Veterans with PTSD and SUD on a 28-
day residential unit. We are proposing a randomized controlled study comparing two groups: an early
intervention PAP treatment group receiving PAP treatment while on the residential unit, compared to a waitlist
control group who will receive PAP treatment at 3-months post-discharge follow-up. Participants will be 194
male and female Veterans on the residential SUD and PTSD unit with SUD, PTSD, and OSA. Our primary aim
is to determine the relative efficacy of PAP treatment on the SUD/PTSD unit, as compared to waitlist control, in
reducing problematic substance use, PTSD symptoms, and suicidal ideation, while improving functioning
among Veterans with comorbid SUD/PTSD at 3-months post-treatment follow-up. We will also compare PAP
adherence rates on PTSD/SUD/functioning outcomes within the PAP treatment group (3-months). Finally, we
plan on comparing adherence rates between the two treatment groups at the 6-months post-treatment follow-
up assessment.
 Examining OSA treatment for SUD and PTSD is highly relevant to the goals of RR&D and the VA to
maximize treatment efficacy for Veterans and has the potential to improve functional and psychological
recovery for a highly prevalent and highly impaired population of Veterans. This research will directly impact
functional outcomes, SUD recovery, and PTSD symptoms in already vulnerable Veterans struggling with SUD
and PTSD. The successful completion of this project will help improve the practices that drive treatment for
Veterans who have both SUD and PTSD. The fundamental rationale for this study is to improve the evidence
base that informs how patients with SUD and PTSD can attain sustained recovery from both of these
disorders.

Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder characterized by a constitutional trisomy of chromosome 21,
neurocognitive delay, phenotypic features, co-occurring structural birth defects, and an increased risk for
chronic health conditions (CHC) such as thyroid disease, osteopenia, seizure disorder, and visual/hearing
problems. Children with DS have a 10-20 fold excess risk for acute leukemia (AL) compared with the general
population, and are also at significantly greater risk for acute therapy-related toxicities. However, few studies
have reported late effects of cancer therapy in survivors of DS-AL, and none have investigated whether these
CHC differ from those experienced by children with DS and no history of cancer. Therefore, although a higher
than expected incidence of late effects is reported in DS-AL survivors, the prevalence and severity of these
CHC relative to the CHC associated with DS is unknown. Further, AL treatment confers well-described risks for
deficits in attention, processing speed, and executive function, but only one small case series has investigated
neuro-psychological (NP) outcomes in DS-AL survivors. Due to a systematic exclusion from research based on
their differing baseline health status, DS-AL survivors are an at-risk population that is largely unstudied.
To address this critical knowledge gap, we will characterize late effects experienced by DS-AL childhood
cancer survivors by determining the prevalence and severity of CHC and clinical and NP outcomes in DS-AL
survivors. Recruiting from DS participants in Children’s Oncology Group studies and registries, our methods
include both medical record data abstraction and prospective in-person and survey-based assessments. Aim 1
will establish an annotated and comprehensively-characterized, contemporary cohort of DS-AL survivors. Aim
2 will leverage access to a well-established cohort of DS persons without cancer history to compare CHC and
NP outcomes with those observed in DS-AL survivors. Aim 3 will identify clinical, genetic, and biological risk
determinants of late effects in DS-AL survivors. Based on our strong preliminary data, we hypothesize that the
prevalence and severity of specific CHC and adverse clinical and NP outcomes will exceed those observed in
non-DS AL and in matched DS controls without cancer history. Further, we expect that DS ALL susceptibility
loci will extend to association with risk for CHC, and correspond with incidence of co-occurring birth defects.
Last, we anticipate that shorter telomere length is associated with adverse NP outcomes. Our multi-disciplinary
team has a strong history of collaboration and expertise in leukemia and cancer survivorship (Gramatges), DS-
AL (Rabin), epidemiology of cancer and birth defects (Lupo), DS-associated CHC (Rosser), NP outcomes in
DS survivors (Jacola), and CHC in survivors of childhood cancer (Chow).
With the support of the Children’s Oncology Group, this multi-site, national study will characterize cancer
treatment outcomes in DS-AL survivors. We anticipate our results will improve survivorship care by informing
clinical practice guidelines for DS-AL survivors, mitigating outcome disparities in this vulnerable population."

 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technology has been widely used in clinical diagnostics for
decades. Nevertheless, its limit of detection (in the range of picogram/milliliter to nanogram/milliliter) has not
been substantially improved in recent years, which inhibits many critical applications such as early detection of
cancers. In conventional ELISAs, enzyme-catalyzed reactions are responsible for the generation of detectable
color signal and thus largely determine the detection sensitivity. Therefore, the detection limit of conventional
ELISAs is inherently limited by the performance of enzymes. In this research, we propose to develop a novel
signal generation paradigm which breaks the intrinsic limitations of enzymes for ELISA technology. Specifically,
in this technique, M-Ptn core-shell nanoparticles (M = Ni, Co, or Fe; n: atomic ratio of Pt to M) (referred to as
""M-Ptn NPs"") are employed as alternatives to enzymes for ELISA. Herein, the M-Ptn NPs act as highly effective
peroxidase mimics, catalyzing colorimetric reaction at a rate much higher than that horseradish peroxidase
(HRP, a typical enzyme for ELISA) can achieve. Note, materials cost of the M-Ptn NPs used in ELISA is low
because of the minimal usage amount (nanogram level per test). We hypothesize that the magnitude of signal
amplification of such M-Ptn NP system could be maximized by carefully controlling the structure and elemental
composition of M-Ptn NPs. In our preliminary study, using carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a model cancer
biomarker, we have demonstrated that the detection limit of conventional ELISA could be lowered ~340 times
(approaching the regime of femtogram/milliliter) by using Ni-Pt NPs as alternatives to HRP. Our research
program is novel and innovative in its approach because such signal generation system for ELISA has several
distinctive advantages over existing designs: i) the use of M-Ptn NPs as peroxidase mimics with record-high
catalytic efficiency, which could generate color signal that is orders of magnitude stronger than HRP does; ii)
the M-Ptn NPs-based ELISA retains the simplicity of conventional HRP-based ELISA, without involving
additional assay procedures and/or devices; iii) the sizes of M-Ptn NPs are designed to be relatively small
(comparable to the dimension of HRP molecule), eliminating the steric hindrance of biomarker capture during
assay; and iv) the M-Ptn NPs are much more stable than natural enzymes, making the new ELISA more
reliable. This research program involves three specific aims: 1) to build the M-Ptn NP system that possess
maximized catalytic efficiencies, 2) to establish the M-Ptn NPs-based ELISA, of which detection limit is ≥1,000-
fold lower than conventional HRP-based ELISA, and 3) to demonstrate clinical use of M-Ptn NPs-based ELISA
by testing different disease biomarkers in human blood samples. The success of this research will i) break
through the existing detection limit barrier of ELISA technology; ii) have a clinical and translational impact on
disease biomarker detection; and iii) impact the general field of in vitro diagnostics by offering a type of ultra-
efficient peroxidase mimics that are suitable for many diagnostic technologies beyond ELISA."

Alterations in kinase signaling underlie many of the most devastating human diseases, including
degenerative disease, autoimmunity and cancer. Thus, not surprisingly, kinases are the second most
targeted group of drug targets (next to G-protein coupled receptors). Yet despite their importance in
disease, only about 8% of kinases are targets of FDA approved drugs and roughly a quarter of the
634 kinases in the human kinome is still considered ‘understudied’, leaving over 100 kinases
untapped as potential therapeutic targets and without clear biological functions. This proposal focuses
on TNK1, a poorly understood member of the ACK kinase family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases
(NRTKs). Our recently published data (Nat. Comm. 2021) uncovered the first mechanism of regulation
and the unusual presence of a ubiquitin-association (UBA) domain on this kinase. Critical gaps
relating to this mechanism and the still unknown cellular function of TNK1 are addressed in this
proposal. Our long-term goal is to discover mechanisms of cell growth and survival that can be
therapeutically targeted in disease. The overall objectives of this proposal are to establish the first
detailed mechanism and function of this understudied kinase. The central hypothesis is that the
binding of the TNK1 UBA domain to clusters of poly-ubiquitin at protein aggregate condensates acts
as a form of induced proximity to oligomerize and activate TNK1 (aim 1). We also hypothesize that the
interaction of 14-3-3 with phospho-Ser502 of TNK1 inhibits TNK1 oligomerization and conceals the
UBA domain, thereby sequestering TNK1 away from ubiquitin in an inactive state (aim 2). Finally, we
posit that TNK1 senses the accumulation of poly-ubiquitin to phosphorylate substrates that promote
the lysosomal degradation of condensates (aim 3). The proposal is significant because it fills a basic
gap in our understanding of TNK1, provides a framework to understand how mutations activate TNK1
in disease, and perhaps most importantly will inform pharmacological strategies that take advantage
of our recently developed TNK1 inhibitor to target TNK1 in disease. The proposal is innovative
because it addresses a novel mechanism of kinase activation through direct interaction with poly-
ubiquitin, thereby establishing condensates as organizing platforms for kinase signaling. In addition,
this proposal lays the first foundation to target TNK1 in disease."

Academic tracking is a widely used practice that groups students into classes according to prior academic
performance, but has been criticized as a form of structural racism and discrimination, as it leads to the
concentration of Black and Latinx students in low-performing tracks. In addition to potential long-term impacts
on education attainment, a powerful social determinant of health, academic tracking may directly affect
adolescent social networks and substance use behaviors. By grouping students together with similarly
performing peers, tracking may reinforce school disengagement and risky health behaviors like substance use,
violence, and delinquency among lower-performing students. However, no known studies examine the health
implications of academic tracking nor tested whether interventions to dismantle tracking positively impact
health. Advancement via Individual Determination (AVID) is a successful college preparatory program that
works in part by “de-tracking” students. AVID targets students from groups under-represented in higher
education, like Black and Latinx students, places them in rigorous college-preparatory courses, and provides
academic and social support to ensure their success. In our pilot study, a handful of students within 5 public
schools were randomized to AVID. We found the program led to connections with more pro-social peers and
lower odds of substance use and delinquency. When applied school-wide, AVID trains schools to ensure all
students have access to rigorous college-preparatory courses. However, there are no studies testing the health
effects of AVID's school-wide program. We propose a longitudinal study of adolescents attending 5 AVID
schools and 10 matched comparison schools (matched on location and student demographics) from racially
and ethnically diverse communities in Southern California. Participants will be followed for 4 years to test
whether exposure to AVID leads to a) lower rates of 30-day substance use (primary outcome--defined as any
alcohol, tobacco, vaping, cannabis, prescription, or illicit drug use in the prior 30 days), and other substance
use behaviors, violence and delinquency; b) increased enrollment in college-preparatory course taking and
healthier social networks (measured by fewer peers engaged in substance use, more peers engaged in school,
and more school-related adults); and c) whether associations between AVID and substance use are explained
by reduced racial/ethnic disparities in college-preparatory course taking and healthier social networks. We will
follow 3,570 9th-12th grade students at intervention and control schools for 4 years, collecting administrative
education data and health behavior and social network survey data as they progress through high school and
transition to college and/or the work force. This study will yield critical knowledge that can inform education and
health policy regarding academic tracking and the use of de-tracking interventions like AVID. This topic
addresses the impact of structural racism and discrimination on substance use and is in keeping with NIDA's
mission to develop and disseminate research that significantly improves drug abuse and addiction prevention."
10854937,"THE TRANSLATIONAL REGULATION OF PRO-APOPTOTIC GENES
PROJECT SUMMARY
Inactivation of the Retinoblastoma 1 protein (pRB) is one of the most common alterations in cancer. This is
because pRB inhibits the activity of three E2F transcription factors, E2F1-3, that control the expression of
numerous critical RB-E2F target genes that are required for cancer cell growth, including cell cycle and metabolic
factors. In addition to tumor-promoting processes, E2F1-3 also regulates the transcription of tumor-inhibiting
genes that play a central role in apoptosis and necrosis. This regulatory circuit links the expression of RB-E2F
proliferation and cell death genes, ultimately preventing uncontrolled cell growth. The widespread loss of pRB
in cancer underscores a significant puzzle in the field: why don’t pRB-deficient cells simply die?
To understand the regulation of the RB-E2F target genes, we profiled RNA and protein changes following pRB-
depletion and found that the pro-apoptotic genes were transcribed, but they were not translated into protein. A
search for RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that bound to and blocked the ribosome occupancy of these genes
identified the Pumilio complex as direct translational regulators of RB-E2F pro-apoptotic mRNAs. Furthermore,
co-deletion of the two core components of the Pumilio complex, PUM1 and PUM2, provoked the cell death of
RB1-/- cancer cells via the translation of pro-apoptotic mRNAs. The human Pumilio complex is comprised of
PUM and NANOS (NOS) proteins, however significant functional redundancy between the members of the PUM
and NOS protein families has limited cellular and tumor studies of the Pumilio complex. To circumvent this issue,
we have engineered human cells to express only a single PUM or NOS protein that we can specifically degrade
utilizing a novel Auxin-inducible degron system. This technical advance has enabled us to conduct kinetic
analysis of RNA stability, localization and translation initiation in the absence of PUM or NOS and to probe the
role(s) of different Pumilio complexes in cellular regulation and tumorigenesis. In this new application we propose
to: 1) Determine the mechanism(s) of Pumilio complex translational suppression of RB-E2F target pro-apoptotic
genes, 2) Define the mechanism of Pumilio complex regulation in RB1 mutant Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)
cells, and 3) Determine the role of the Pumilio complex in the Rb1-/-; Trp53-/- mouse SCLC tumorigenesis model.
These studies will identify the mechanism(s) that prevent the production of cell death components in highly
aggressive and metastatic SCLC."

10854968,"Project Summary/Abstract
Obesity is the most prevalent preventable risk factor for cardiometabolic morbidity and mortality in the US.
Additionally, obesity is more prevalent among racial/ethnic minorities whose rates continue to increase.
Racial/ethnic disparities in obesity are influenced by social determinants of health that contribute to social
disadvantage at multiple levels of influence. Among their influences, social determinants of health can interfere
with the diet and activity behaviors that are the primary drivers of obesity and the targets of weight
management interventions. Interventions need to account for these potential influences of social disadvantage.
Mobile Health (mHealth) interventions are particularly promising because they have the reach and efficiency
for equitable population-level dissemination. However, the degree to which social disadvantage interferes with
mHealth treatment efficacy has not been well-studied, and so it is unclear whether mHealth weight
management intervention produces equitable outcomes across sociocultural contexts. Research is needed to
explore whether social disadvantage constrains the benefit derived from mHealth intervention, in order to
inform potentially needed optimization. This project will leverage multiple synergistic research methods that
span the intervention evidence spectrum to evaluate this question. A systematic review and meta-analysis will
provide a comprehensive, rigorous overview of research literature on how mHealth obesity treatment effects
may be moderated by socioenvironmental context and disadvantage. Secondary quantitative analyses of two
previously conducted mHealth weight loss trials will evaluate the extent to which multilevel social determinants
of health moderate improvements in health behaviors. Finally, qualitative interviews and analysis will be used
to evaluate racial/ethnic minority participants’ perceptions of barriers and facilitators to engagement in mHealth
weight management. Together, these synergistic methods to be learned and applied in this fellowship span the
analytic spectrum. Their integration will build a coherent foundation upon which we can advance mHealth
interventions for weight management among racial/ethnic minorities."
10855865,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute gastrointestinal and respiratory infections are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children
worldwide. Among gastrointestinal pathogens, human norovirus (HuNoV, NIAID category B pathogen) is the
leading cause of acute and sporadic gastroenteritis and is responsible for over 1 million pediatric health care
visits in the US each year. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, NIAID category C pathogen) is the major respiratory
pathogen in children globally and results in over 1.5 million health care visits annually in the US. In addition to
the clinical burden of disease, both viruses cause significant economic burden. There are currently no approved
vaccines for children for HuNoV or RSV. However, several vaccines and long-acting monoclonal antibodies are
in clinical trials or recently approved and are anticipated to be available to protect children. Immune pressure
driven changes in the genomic landscape of both viruses are anticipated with the introduction of interventions.
This is in addition to changes in the epidemiology following the COVID-19 pandemic which altered the burden of
disease and circulating patterns of these viruses, all posing challenges for the long-term success of interventions.
We propose to perform innovative and extensive sequencing of pediatric stool and respiratory samples from
racially and ethnically diverse population, together with functional validation in physiologically relevant pediatric
ex vivo organoid cultures, to identify viral and host factors affecting strain emergence and disease presentation.
Our studies will be focused on pediatric samples and organoids as children have long been considered a key
population for emergence of new HuNoV and RSV variants. Study samples will cover four distinct time periods:
pre-pandemic, pandemic, post-pandemic, and following the introduction of HuNoV and RSV interventions. The
studies are feasible since Project investigators are part of the CDC’s New Vaccine Surveillance Network that
evaluates the burden of pediatric gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses in seven sites across the US, and
thus have access to thousands of relevant clinical samples and associated metadata. We will perform full-length
HuNoV and RSV genome analysis, microbiome, transcriptome, and virome analysis of clinical samples (Aim 1).
Study investigators have also established and characterized pediatric human intestinal and nasal organoids that
will serve as physiologically relevant models for functional studies (Aim 2).
Our proposed studies will provide a rich repository of genomic data and allow us to (i) track strain emergence
and diversity, (ii) discover biomarkers for mucosal gastrointestinal and respiratory disease, (iii) identify viral
signatures related to pathogenesis and strain emergence, and (iv) functionally delineate virus–host–microbiome
interactions. The timing of these studies is critical in the context of pandemic-induced epidemiological shifts and
the potential for additional genetic modifications due to the introduction of new interventions. Overall, our studies
will address key questions on HuNoV and RSV diversity, evolution and replication needed to enable successful
implementation of interventions."

Tobacco use has alarmingly high rates among people with HIV (PWH), 43% compared with 15% in the general
population. Due to the development of highly effective treatments for HIV and the resulting increased longevity
among PWH, this population now loses more life years to smoking than to HIV infection itself. Novel and
effective models to deliver wider reaching smoking cessation interventions for PWH are highly needed and
indicated as a priority for NIH. Digital therapeutics (DTx) may be a novel, scalable, and highly available
approach for engaging and treating smoking in this population. However, although DTx for smoking cessation
have been shown effective in the general population, no large trial to date has examined the effectiveness of a
tailored DTx for smoking cessation in PWH, and no implementation science work has examined barriers and
facilitators of implementation of DTx for smoking cessation in this population. In prior early-phase work, we
developed LTQ-H, a user-centered smoking cessation DTx tailored to the needs of PWH (R21 CA243911).
This novel DTx is based on a mental health intervention -- Acceptance and Commitment Therapy -- that has
been shown effective as a treatment for smoking cessation. LTQ-H also provides recommendations from U.S.
Clinical Practice Guidelines. We tested LTQ-H in a remote pilot randomized controlled trial. Consistent with our
conceptual model, results indicated significant effects on the pilot’s primary outcomes: (1) high levels of
objective user engagement, (2) adherence to smoking cessation content, and (3) features that effectively
addressed our targeted components (e.g., mental health, cognitive deficits, and HIV stigma). LTQ-H’s quit
rates were high compared to prior mobile behavioral smoking cessation interventions for this population,
though the trial was not powered to detect smoking outcome differences with the control group. The trial
recruited a demographically diverse sample of patients from 9 U.S. states and established relationships with
several HIV clinics in the eastern U.S. In this project, we will conduct a type 1 hybrid effectiveness
implementation trial informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. The trial aims to:
(1) compare the effectiveness of LTQ-H to QuitGuide, an evidence-based DTx for the general population, and
(2) evaluate acceptability, appropriateness, costs, and feasibility of DTx for smoking cessation among PWH
and HIV clinics. The trial focuses on two high-priority research areas in the NIH Strategic Plan for HIV-Related
Research and the Cancer Moonshot Research Initiative: (1) the incorporation of state-of-the-art technology to
improve access to hard-to-reach populations and settings, and (2) the use of implementation science to
address cancer health disparities. This study will generate the necessary clinical effectiveness data and

This major instrumentation proposal requests funds for the purchase of a JEOL 500 MHz NMR spectrometer to
support a large user base of NIH-funded researchers at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine (JHSOM). Re-
searchers supported by the JHSOM NMR facility come from diverse clinical and basic science departments and
are funded by numerous NIH institutes (NIGMS, NCI, NIAID, NIDDK, NIDA, NINDS, NIA, NIBIB, NEI, and NIMH).
This new state-of-the-art spectrometer package consists of a 11.7T, shielded, 54 mm bore magnet, a spectrom-
eter console with an RF generation system, preamplifiers, power amplifiers, digital receivers, and a field gradient
system. The requested 5 mm FG/RO HFX digital autotune probe and 24 slots autosampler are essential features
to support characterization of small molecules studied by our user base and to maximize throughput and ease-
of-use. The new Dell Precision Workstation and the pulse programmer controlled by the Delta FT-NMR software
provide a friendly user interface that will facilitate the achievement of research goals. Since the previous sub-
mission, due to frequent and expensive repairs and crippling service disruptions, our previous 500 MHz Bruker
system was replaced with the JEOL 500 MHz spectrometer described above. We are currently using the JEOL
system under a negotiated evaluation agreement with an option to pay and own, extend the lease, or return
without full payment by May 10, 2024. For 23 years this NMR core resource, which is managed and supported
by the Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences (DPMS), has been key in supporting biomedical
chemistry research at the school of medicine. The health-related goals of the supported projects range from
development of new imaging agents, new drug discovery for cancer and neurological diseases, and basic inves-
tigations into cellular metabolomics and drug metabolism. The facility provides an essential resource for syn-
thetic chemistry, drug development and basic science research efforts at the medical school campus. It provides
the main tool for our chemists to assess the outcome of chemical transformations (1D 1H, 31P, 13C and 19F NMR
spectra). Our research spans all classes of organic molecules of biomedical interest, including bioactive probes,
drugs, and polymer conjugated molecules. In addition, the capabilities of this moderately high-field instrument
allow for more sophisticated homonuclear and heteronuclear experiments to elucidate the structure of challeng-
ing small molecules, nucleic acids, small proteins, and peptides (2D COSY, TOCSY, HSQC, HMBC, NOESY).
Thus, this facility has contributed to biomedical research in a unique way over the past 23 years and will continue
in this role with this new, very needed instrumentation upgrade."
10852024,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
This proposal aims to improve our diagnosis and mechanistic understanding of right ventricular (RV) myocyte
dysfunction in heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction and pulmonary hypertension (HFrEF-PH).
Our inability to accurately identify RV failure worsens prognostic and therapeutic efforts in many HFrEF-PH
clinical scenarios. RV myocyte contractile reserve indices, such as calcium-activated isometric tension and
length-dependent active tension, are reduced in end-stage human HFrEF-PH RV. The latter, a key contributor
to chamber Frank-Starling reserve, is severely depressed in HFrEF-PH yet entirely uncaptured by clinical
indices. This deficiency highlights one potential reason why clinical tools fall short. A shortcoming of this work
was its study of end-stage disease; correlates of myocyte dysfunction from earlier-stage disease would provide
more clinically useful insight. Our central hypothesis is that clinical identification of RV myocyte disease in
HFrEF-PH requires measuring RV contractile reserve during exercise. Our prior study of primary PH patients
supports this, and new data in patients with PH secondary to heart failure do so as well. We also reveal a novel
mechanism linking poor recruitment of super-relaxed myosin to poor myocyte length-dependent tension. This
links, for the first time in humans, thick filament myosin to RV myocyte and chamber reserve. Dissecting these
findings will clarify mechanism and help guide the use of novel direct-acting sarcomere drugs for such myocyte
deficits. We will test our hypothesis via three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we test whether RV exercise reserve
measures are better than resting RV measures at identifying RV myocyte contractile dysfunction. We will do
this by prospectively measuring rest and exercise RV function using clinical and pressure-volume loop-derived
RV indices and comparing their ability to identify intrinsic RV myocyte contractile failure, the latter ascertained
from concurrently obtained RV biopsies. In Aim 2, we test whether hypophosphorylation of protein kinase A-
protein targets or hyperphosphorylation of sarcomere Z-disc scaffolding proteins blunts length-dependent
activation in HFrEF-PH RV myocytes. We will assess myocytes under the influence of select kinases and
phosphatases, assess thick filament super-relaxed myosin recruitment, and test the effect of specific
modifications on length-dependent force in human engineered heart tissue. In Aim 3, we test the ability of
novel direct-acting sarcomere drugs, termed myotropes, on ex vivo HFrEF RV myocyte length-dependent
tension. We also test whether newfound Aim 1 clinical measures identify patients with better drug response.
Through this proposal, we expect to deliver novel clinical indicators of intrinsic HFrEF-PH RV myocyte failure.
By coupling these clinical indicators to biophysical mechanisms and drug responses, we hope to usher in novel
treatments for RV failure. These goals, which align with those of the NHLBI, would fulfill a major unmet need
for RV failure due to HFrEF-PH. The PI Dr. Hsu, an early-stage investigator, has developed the necessary
clinical-translational expertise and has assembled an exceptional scientific team to deliver on this proposal."
10841223,"Project Abstract
Targeted covalent inhibitors (TCI) represent a powerful but underexploited chemistry for targeting challenging
and uncharacterized protein structures, especially therapeutically relevant targets. Among the many
electrophilic warheads capable of modifying proteins, sulfonyl-fluoride exchange chemistry (SuFEx) are
among the most chemically versatile. SuFEx combines high modification yields with broad cellular proteome
coverage due to the targeting of Lys, Tyr, Ser, and His residues that are abundant among viral, bacterial, and
eukaryotic proteomes (i.e., compared with the relatively low abundance of cysteines targeted by most other
warheads). Given the broad coverage by SuFEx warheads, they would be an invaluable tool to target HIV-1
protein targets as well as their interactions with cellular proteins, where reactive cysteines may be absent.
Despite the great potential of SuFEx warheads as chemical probes, and efforts from both academia and
industry to develop the methodology, they are heavily underexploited given that the breadth of their intrinsic
chemical reactivity has not been fully characterized and cataloged. Thus, there is a need to determine SuFEx
chemistry intrinsic reactivity to allow the development of predictive models. This information can be used to
design SuFEx warheads to provide the appropriate activity for covalent modification. This proposal seeks to
address this need by experimentally determining the intrinsic reactivity of a large number of SuFEx probes,
spanning the largest commercially available chemical space, and to develop quantum mechanics and
machine learning models to predict these reactivities in a drug/probe design setting. A prospective virtual
screen incorporating this information will be performed against HIV CA, leading to new chemical matter in a
novel ligand class against this protein."

they are easy to manipulate, breed, and observe during development. However, the absence of universal
standards significantly impedes scientific progress and therefore human and environmental health. Standard
ontologies and data models are acutely needed to improve data compatibility within and across species and
domains. We propose to address these needs by creating community-built standards for annotating zebrafish
toxicological exposure and their phenotypic outcomes (toxicophenotypes). We will design and deploy a
toxicophenotype data model that will advance ontologies such as the Zebrafish Phenotype Ontology (ZP). This
data model will allow integration and interoperability across species and across toxicological studies. We will
create a toxicophenotype annotation toolkit that will allow users to annotate their data conforming to the newly
created toxicophenotype data model and ZP, and therefore create “born-interoperable” data. Finally, we will
instantiate a zebrafish toxicophenotype atlas web application. This atlas will serve as a visual definition of the
standards and their documentation for examining variations of specific phenotypes by laboratories in the
community. Users will be able to explore and query exposures and phenotypes of interest and see example
images demonstrating the phenotypes.
This project will community-governed by diverse stakeholders in toxicology and environmental health sciences
to ensure fit-for-purpose design and sustainability. Towards that end, we will create robust, transparent
structures for deciding on standards content, structure, and versioning; attribution policies; and content
management and access practices. We will coordinate requirements gathering, documenting best practices for
using the standards and annotations, usability testing, and plans for sustainability.
Realizing interoperable toxicophenotypic data is crucial to improve data integration across scale and
granularity; thereby accelerating an understanding of environmental influences on health."
10840946,"To date, approximately 30 million Americans are estimated to have chronic kidney disease, a major
health care burden in the United States. Podocytes are terminally differentiated post-mitotic visceral epithelial
cells in the glomerulus whose major function is the maintenance of the renal filtration barrier. Glomerular
diseases such as Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN) and subtypes of Focal Segmental
Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), in particular collapsing and cellular variants, are marked by initial podocyte injury
and detachment, which triggers aberrant proliferation of neighboring parietal epithelial cell (PEC), resulting in
crescent or pseudocrescent formation and eventual glomerulosclerosis. Previous studies suggest the crosstalk
between podocytes and parietal epithelial cells (PECs) might play a role in the pathogenesis of these
hyperplastic lesions, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Activation of Signal Transducer and Activator of
Transcription 3 (STAT3) has been implicated in the initiation and progression of both RPGN and collapsing
FSGS. Although activation of STAT3 signaling plays an important role in the pathogenesis of RPGN and
subtypes of FSGS, the regulation of STAT3 signaling remains to be explored. Recent studies demonstrate that
a zinc-finger transcription factor, Krüppel-Like Factor 4 (KLF4), might serve as a key negative regulator of
STAT3 signaling. Although several members of the KLF family have been implicated in cell differentiation,
KLF4 was first identified as a critical negative regulator of proliferation. Our preliminary data suggests that the
podocyte-specific loss of Klf4 in mice renders the activation of dysregulated glomerular STAT3 signaling,
podocyte injury, PEC proliferation, and eventual FSGS and renal failure. Furthermore, we showed that the
activation of STAT3 signaling inversely correlated with KLF4 expression in the glomeruli of kidney biopsies with
RPGN as compared to control specimens. Based on these data, we hypothesize that podocyte-specific KLF4
is required for the maintenance of podocyte integrity and prevention of aberrant PEC proliferation in
proliferative glomerulopathies. We propose to test this hypothesis through the following specific aims: (1)
Investigate the requisite role of podocyte-specific KLF4-STAT3 signaling in proliferative glomerulopathies and

10841387,"179 million people in the US suffer from infectious diarrhea every year, and deaths have increased four times since 1980. A major cause of infectious diarrhea in the US is enterotoxigenic E. coli, which produces heatstable enterotoxins (ST) to overactivate host guanylyl-cyclase C (GC-C), a major regulator of fluid balance in the gut. STs cause diarrhea in the host, benefiting the bacteria by facilitating spread to new hosts. Members of this team previously identified the ST-GC-C interface as an ongoing evolutionary conflict between hosts and pathogens, where GC-C was undergoing positive selection in primates and especially bats. The latter taxa also present compensatory evolution in the host ligand for GC-C, uroguanylin, maintaining its ability to activate GCC
despite the evolution of GC-C in response to the bacterial evolutionary pressure. In this proposal, this unexpected compensatory evolution in a critical physiologic pathway will be leveraged to identify potential inhibitors of STs as a treatment strategy for infectious diarrhea in humans.
The central hypothesis is that rapid evolution of uroguanylin and ST resulted in functional differences in binding and activation of GC-C and high affinity-low activity peptides that will competitively inhibit human-pathogenic enterotoxins from causing diarrhea can be found and leveraged to treat infectious diarrhea in the future. Aim (1) will characterize the effect of uroguanylin and enterotoxin variation on binding and activation of GC-C. Evolutionary analyses of GC-C ligands will be conducted to identify sites under positive selection, and ligands will be tested for binding and activation to identify high affinity and low activity candidates. Aim (2) will identify peptides that modulate GC-C activation in cellular and organoid models of diarrheal infection. High affinity-low activity peptides will be tested in competition assays to determine if enterotoxins can be blocked from causing diarrhea as a direct method of treating infectious diarrhea. The results will inform the design of future peptide
treatments for infectious diarrhea that will greatly improve clinical care by using targeted therapy instead of mainly treating symptoms. This project will provide excellent multidisciplinary training in evolutionary analysis, biochemical assays, and organoid models, complemented by clinical mentorship and shadowing in infectious disease. The training plan was developed to complete the central goals of conducting independent, collaborative research; advancing communication and grant-writing skills; learning how to effectively mentor and teach trainees in a supportive
environment; and honing clinical skills in preparation for the return to medical school. This training is ideal for a future physician-scientist with the goal of improving patient care at the intersection of basic research and clinical treatment of pediatric infectious diseases."

This study will assess the relationships among health, stigma, structural racism and discrimination, resources,
and biomarkers of health and aging in older gay men of four racial/ethnic groups— African American, Latinx,
Asian American, and White— and across HIV status. This research is needed because older gay men’s health
fares worse than that of their heterosexual counterparts, their exposure to structural discrimination is higher,
and they have less access to supportive resources than older heterosexual men. Notably, 40 years after we
first faced HIV, we continue to learn about the consequences of HIV, including aging with HIV. Gay men
comprise the majority of older people living with HIV.
Older gay men face unique health risks and protective factors, yet they constitute a very diverse and complex
population. What we know about their health comes from mostly white, well-educated, and convenient
samples. Hence, the need to collect data from diverse and valid samples. This is a cross-sectional study based
on San Francisco Bay Area. Quantitative and Qualitative data will be collected from a sample of 600 older gay
men. We will collect structural, individual, and biological data to test hypotheses regarding the associations
among structural racism and discrimination, resources, and health (e.g., mental health, HIV risk, cognitive
function). Our team is multidisciplinary and includes our community partner, The Elizabeth Taylor 50-Plus
Network (of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation).
This proposal is in response to NIH’s RFA Understanding and Addressing the Impact of Structural Racism and
Discrimination on Minority Health and Health Disparities. It addresses the Office of AIDS Research Strategic
Plan of tackling HIV comorbidities and health disparities. The data and findings from this study are intended to
constitute the baseline for a longitudinal study."

This is a competing continuation application to renew the Research Training Program in Toxicology and
Environmental Health at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The Program, established in 2000,
educates pre-and postdoctoral trainees in reproductive/endocrine toxicology, neurotoxicology, nutritional
toxicology, and nanotoxicology. The need for training in toxicology and environmental health is every bit as
urgent today as it was 20 years ago when the Training Program was first conceived. The Program unites several
long-standing areas of research excellence on the University of Illinois campus—environmental toxicology,
reproductive biology, neuroscience, nutritional sciences, chemistry, and bioengineering. Nineteen faculty
members from seven departments in four colleges will serve as preceptors for the Training Program, making this
a truly interdisciplinary training program. Thirteen of the preceptors, including the Program Director and
Associate Director, have been affiliated with the training program for many years, providing long-term stability
and continuity to the program. Six new preceptors will be added this funding period so that we can expand
training opportunities in important new research areas including nanoparticle toxicity, and environmental impacts
on epigenetics, metabolism, male reproduction, and neurological disorders such as epilepsy. The preceptors are
well funded, collaborate extensively, and have a wealth of experience mentoring students and postdocs.
Together, they currently have over 44 federally funded research grants totaling almost 12 million dollars/year in
direct costs, and 22 grants from other sources totaling about 2 million dollars/year in direct costs. Collaborations
among labs working at the molecular, cellular, whole animal and human health levels provide trainees with the
unique opportunity to directly observe and participate in translational research. Selection of the 4 pre- and 3
postdoctoral trainees supported by this Program is based on academic success, strength of the proposed
research, relevance of the research to Program goals, and commitment to toxicology and environmental health.
Trainees are appointed for 2 years. The Program offers a broad range of graduate level courses in toxicology.
In addition to fulfilling departmental requirements, all predoctoral trainees take basic toxicology, systems
toxicology, and at least one other advanced toxicology course. Postdoctoral trainees conduct independent
research. All pre- and postdoctoral trainees attend weekly toxicology research seminars, a monthly toxicology
journal club, and a course on research ethics in toxicology, coordinated by the Director and team taught by the
preceptors. Trainees also attend career development workshops and take a grant writing class. They are
required to present their research in the toxicology seminar series and strongly encouraged to attend national or
international meetings to present their work. Recruitment of trainees from under-represented groups is a high
priority and strong efforts to diversify the Training Program will continue in the next funding period. Trainees are
expected to pursue toxicology-related research careers in academia, government, or industry."

Although most very preterm (VP; <32 weeks gestation) infants survive to discharge from the neonatal intensive
care unit (NICU), they remain at heightened risk for impaired neurodevelopment (ND), obesity and
cardiometabolic conditions, burdening families and translating to high healthcare costs over the lifespan. One
strategy to reduce these risks is to feed mother’s own milk (MOM) during the NICU hospitalization, because
MOM is associated with a dose-dependent enhancement in early brain development, better ND outcomes, and
a reduced risk of obesity and its complications. Observational studies have documented health and economic
benefits associated with MOM, but all of these studies have been limited by the inability to ethically randomize
VP infants to receive different doses of MOM. Although exclusive MOM feedings through the first 6 months of
life are recommended for all infants, mothers of VP infants face numerous barriers in providing MOM. Almost
50% of mothers discontinue MOM provision before NICU discharge, well before their infants reach 6 months of
age. Our ongoing NIH-funded randomized controlled trial, “Reducing disparity in the receipt of mother’s own
milk in very low birthweight infants: An economic intervention” (ReDiMOM, R01MD013969) was designed to
test the effectiveness of an economic intervention that covers the maternal costs of providing MOM in the
NICU. ReDiMOM provides an economic bundle to intervention group mothers: free hospital grade electric
breast pump rental, free pickup of pumped MOM from the home, and payment for each day spent pumping to
offset maternal opportunity costs. Both intervention and control group mothers receive standard NICU-specific
lactation care. This ethical randomization of an intervention to achieve higher NICU MOM doses in the
intervention group provides the first opportunity to obtain experimental evidence of MOM’s impact on health
and economic outcomes in early childhood. Leveraging the randomized design of ReDiMOM, the overall aim of
this study is to assess ND (cognitive, language and motor index scores), adiposity, and duration of MOM
feedings, total cost of care and cost-effectiveness through 20 months’ corrected age, without residual
confounding concerns. Additionally, this study will assess the relationship between total duration of MOM
feeding (in NICU and post discharge) and early childhood outcomes using a robust cohort design. This study
provides an unparalleled opportunity to obtain experimental evidence of the effect of MOM feedings on early
childhood ND and adiposity in VP infants without unmeasured confounding. It will provide the highest quality of
evidence for decision makers and essential economic data needed to compare the two NICU lactation
strategies employed in ReDiMOM. The impact will be on prioritizing investment in effective strategies that
support MOM for VP infants and reduce inequities in the receipt of MOM, ultimately leading to improved
outcomes for all VP infants."
10842297,"Bacteria that chronically colonize the host, such as the gut microbiota, must adapt to various forms of stress in the host environment. The molecular mechanisms bacteria use to sense and respond to these environmental signals are crucial for maintaining symbiotic associations with host cells. Oxidative stress is a hallmark of host-microbe interaction best known for its role in the host immune response; however, epithelial barriers also generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to microbial contact. My lab uses chemical and genetic tools to define molecular mechanisms of bacterial adaptation to oxidative stress. We use the common gastric symbiont Helicobacter pylori to model bacterial responses to physiological ROS. H. pylori is a normal member of the gastric flora that can persist for decades in the host despite constant exposure to ROS-generating epithelial cells, similar to many commensal microbes. Using H. pylori co-cultured with gastric epithelial cells, we have developed a chemical proteomic strategy that can identify protein targets of ROS at the host-microbe interface. Unlike conventional methods for analyzing changes in gene expression, our approach detects post-translational oxidative modifications that can alter cell signaling even when protein levels do not change. This allows us to uncover redox-signaling events at the host-microbe interface that are largely unexplored and likely mediate bacterial adaptation to oxidative stress. In parallel, we are investigating thiol-containing small molecules that maintain redox balance within bacterial cells. While these low-molecular-weight (LMW) thiols are synthesized by nearly all life forms, certain classes of bacteria lack the canonical enzymes required for LMW-thiol biosynthesis. Consequently, how these bacteria detoxify ROS at the host-microbe interface remains an open question. We recently discovered a novel bacterial transporter of ergothioneine (EGT), an LMW thiol with potent antioxidant properties that is abundant in animal tissues. This transporter is broadly conserved in bacteria that commonly colonize the gastrointestinal tract; thus, EGT uptake could represent a new mechanism of microbial redox regulation at the host-microbe interface. In this proposal, we will determine how protein oxidation and LMW-thiol transport shape bacterial adaptation to the host environment. First, we will identify bacterial proteins that are oxidized following microbial contact with ROS-generating eukaryotic cells and elucidate the redox-signaling pathways that enable bacterial adaptation to physiological ROS. Second, we will characterize the proteins responsible for EGT transport in bacteria to increase understanding of this highly conserved process and its role in microbial redox biology. We will also use animal models to determine how EGT uptake influences microbial colonization and EGT metabolism in vivo. Together, these studies will define fundamental redox-signaling pathways (project 1) and transport mechanisms (project 2) that help maintain homeostasis at the host-microbe interface. In the long term, our work will provide a framework for investigating these processes in other microbes and could reveal new targets for the rational design of anti-infective therapies."

This application is based on the discovery that reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS)
within the nucleus of macrophages are powerful signals regulating the polarization of the early
immune response and, in particular, the activation of the acute phase of inflammation.
Specifically, we found that the promoters of a subset of pro-inflammatory NFκB-target genes,
while remaining constitutively accessible, are muted by association with SOCS1, a redox sensitive
protein that binds and depletes incoming p65 NFκB. This mechanism simultaneously prevents
inflammatory tissue injury during homeostasis as well as provides a rapid and specific pathway
to mobilizing aggressive innate immune cells to hunt and kill highly proliferative pathogenic
microbes. NOS1-derived nitric oxide (NO) displaces SOCS1 by S-nitrosylation licensing the
transcription of acute pro-inflammatory NFκB-target genes. Because H2O2 (ROS) can modify
cysteines similarly to NO, we hypothesize that oxidative stress in the nucleus mimics NO,
displacing SOCS1 from regulatory regions of pro-inflammatory genes as well as preventing its de
novo deposition thereby extending the acute phase of inflammation and preventing the transition
to inflammatory resolution and tissue healing. Clinically, this exacerbates pulmonary tissue injury
and elevates the risk of ARDS in patients with underlying oxidative stress caused by old age,
smoking, autoimmunity, or other conditions. Interestingly, we found that although suppressing
nuclear NO or ROS eliminates much of the inflammatory tissue injury in response to LPS, the
ability of mice to control K. pneumoniae infection remains intact, indicating that targeting nuclear
NO and ROS with existing compounds may be clinically useful to prevent at-risk patients from
evolving to ARDS. Currently, ARDS prevention and management is accomplished by the use of
powerful immunosuppressive drugs that compromise the ability of the patient to fight infection. In
this regard, this proposed project has the potential to advance a long sought goal in the field that
is finding ways to suppress inflammatory tissue injury and ARDS while preserving the ability of
innate immune cells to eliminate infectious agents intact."

Obesity and cardiometabolic comorbidities are leading chronic conditions among middle-aged and older adults.
During the COVID-19 pandemic unhealthy lifestyle habits seem to worsen to a greater degree in those with
multiple chronic conditions, promoting weight gain and further widening health disparities. Middle to older aged
adults with underlying multimorbid conditions, especially minorities, are particularly vulnerable to the secondary
health effects of the pandemic and are the target population for this study. This study capitalizes on our
decades-long translational research on the efficacious Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and DPP-based
Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) interventions; our extensive experience in using electronic health records
(EHR) for patient identification and monitoring; and our partnerships with multisector stakeholders in digital
health and wellness solutions. This multisite clinical trial uses a 2-stage sequential randomization design to test
the adaptive and nonadaptive augmentation of an EHR-integrated, validated base (GLB video) intervention
using problem solving treatment (PST), a proven behavior therapy. English/Spanish speaking adults (N=1029),
≥50 years with a body mass index ≥27 and ≥1 cardiometabolic conditions, will be randomized at baseline to
base intervention or waitlist control. Responders to the base intervention, defined by ≥3% weight loss at 6
weeks, will continue the base intervention; participants with <3% weight loss or missing weight data (i.e.,
nonresponders) will be re-randomized to continue the base intervention alone or augmented with PST
coaching via videoconference. Waitlist participants will be re-randomized after a 12-week control period to
receive the base or the augmented intervention, but without tailoring based on early weight loss. The base
intervention will use EHR-integrated delivery of the self-directed GLB videos, 1 per week for 12 weeks,
followed by digital behavior change and motivational messages. The augmented intervention includes base
intervention + PST videoconference coaching. All participants will receive a tablet, wireless weight scale, and
wearable activity tracker and will be followed for 52 weeks after baseline randomization. Aim 1 is to
demonstrate intervention effects on weight loss, behavior change, and patient-reported outcomes. We
hypothesize: (1) the augmented intervention will be more effective than the base intervention both among early
nonresponders to the base intervention (adaptive) and among participants in the waitlist group (nonadaptive) at
52 weeks; (2) the adaptive augmented intervention will be more efficacious than the base intervention and
more efficacious than the waitlist control group at 12 weeks. Aim 2 is to identify predictors of clinically
significant (5%) weight loss for individual patients, using sociodemographic, clinical and behavioral
engagement characteristics. The proposed interventions are poised to have immediate and widespread impact
on access, reach, delivery, effectiveness, scalability and sustainability. This study, if successful, will point the
way toward an inexpensive, scalable intervention that would likely be adopted by insurers."

Tissue function demands the concerted function of specialized parenchymal cells, as well
as structural (vascular and mesenchymal) cell. Innate immune cells, such as macrophages
that populate and specialize in every organ, are now recognized actors in supporting tissue
function and long-term fitness. Only recently, neutrophils, the most abundant innate immune
leukocytes, have taken center stage and their functional diversity found important in the
context of disease. For example, low density neutrophils in cancer patients are a source of
angiogenic and immune-suppressive cues, whereas those that form NETs are a source of
autoantigens and chronic inflammation. In contrast to their contributions to disease, we have
pioneered studies showing that, like macrophages, neutrophils are part of normal tissue
homeostasis and that they can adapt to multiple environments in the healthy organism.
These new findings prompt the need to better understand how neutrophils adapt to the
different environments to fully grasp their contributions to homeostasis, and to determine the
extent to which they are co-opted by different types of disease. This is particularly relevant
in the context of acute or chronic inflammation, as perturbations of specific neutrophil fates
in organs may compromise tissue fitness, and increase the susceptibility to disease. The
overarching goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms that shape neutrophil
fates in tissues as a first step to define their actual contributions to organismal physiology
beyond immune defense. In the long term, we ambition to use this knowledge to build
precision medicine based on the remarkable plasticity of these cells.
To achieve these goals, we will first focus on the lung as model organ to define how
neutrophils naturally acquire angiogenic properties using mouse genetics, and the
consequences of disrupting this program in tissue repair (Aim 1). We will then query how
neutrophils acquire a surprising matrix-producing signature in barrier tissues, and use
biomechanical and imaging tools to define the contribution of this program to barrier integrity
and repair in the skin (Aim 2)."

For youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D), the transition into young adulthood is a high-risk period for deteriorations
in glycemic control. T1D self-management, a key driver of glycemic control, is complicated by the transitional
nature of this developmental period, which is associated with changes in multiple domains (i.e., biological, social,
and environmental). Evidenced-based transition preparation interventions are needed prior to initiating adult
healthcare to improve T1D self-management and glycemic control and increase transition readiness; however,
evidence from rigorous trials is limited. To address this gap, we developed and conducted a single-arm pilot of
SHIFT, a multisystem transition preparation intervention. Preliminary data from this pilot informed the current
application, which proposes to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a clinic-based transition
preparation intervention (SHIFT2) for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with T1D. Fifty AYAs (16-22 years)
and a parent will be randomized to either: 1) a 6-month multisystem transition preparation program (SHIFT2), or
2) enhanced treatment as usual (TAU+). TAU+ includes usual T1D care, provider training, and standard patient
education, matched to the intervention contact schedule. SHIFT2 will employ a hybrid delivery mode for
intervention visits using clinic staff (Certified Diabetes Care and Education Specialists [CDCES]) and hospital-
based technology platforms (e.g., virtual visits, patient portal). AYAs will receive evidence-based content across
3 domains: psychoeducation/skill building, behavioral self-management, and provider communication. Parents
will receive psychoeducation and training in developmentally appropriate parenting strategies to support their
AYA in increasing independent self-management and preparing for transition. Providers will receive a video
module that highlights their role preparing AYAs for transition and provides evidence-based, practical tips to
enhance communication with AYAs. In order to understand key stakeholders’ experiences regarding transitioning
to adult care, qualitative interviews with a subset of AYAs who transitioned to adult care and their parents (n=20
AYA-parent dyads) and with providers (n=10 endocrinology providers and CDCES), will be conducted to inform
further protocol refinement for future studies. This application has compelling scientific and clinical significance.
It improves upon prior research via use of a rigorous RCT design, evidence-based intervention components
within a multisystem framework, and objective assessment of the primary outcome (HbA1c). Findings will
advance science and inform clinical recommendations regarding optimal strategies to promote independent T1D
self-management in AYAs prior to transitioning to adult care.

10843294,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is defined by its hallmark locomotor symptoms including tremor, rigidity,
bradykinesia and postural instability, which are caused by a progressive loss of nigral dopaminergic (DA)
neurons. A well-recognized categorization of Parkinson’s disease is based on whether rest tremor is present or
not at disease onset. PD patients who have rest tremor at onset generally have slower progression and better
prognosis than PD patients without rest tremor at onset. Our preliminary study showed that the expression of
genes controlling dopamine synthesis, sequestration and degradation was significantly different between
midbrain DA neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) of normal subjects vs. idiopathic PD
patients. Expression of some of these genes was also significantly different between idiopathic PD patients
with or without rest tremor at onset. We have developed a series of new technologies including the
differentiation of iPSCs to A9 DA neurons and the direct conversion of human skin fibroblasts and urinary track
cells (UTCs) to midbrain DA neurons. Using these innovative technologies, the proposal aims to identify
molecular signatures that can segregate PD patients and normal subjects, and distinguish PD patients with or
without rest tremor at onset. The converging development of stem cell technologies enables this project to
identify molecular signatures of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, which will significantly advance PD diagnosis,
research and therapeutic development."
10843297,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Maintenance of body temperature at the optimal level is crucial for survival, and it requires homeostatic
feedback regulation based on monitoring the temperature of internal organs as well as the environment.
Homeostatic thermoregulation in response to changes of brain temperature relies on the temperature-
sensitive neurons in the preoptic area of the anterior hypothalamus (POA). These neurons constitute about
one third of the medial and lateral POA neurons and are intermingled with temperature-insensitive neurons
that control drinking, feeding, sleep, and parental behaviors. For eight decades since the discovery of
temperature-sensitive neurons in the brain, electrophysiology has been the only way to identify these central
neurons. Having identified the first molecular marker for temperature-sensitive POA neurons by combining
single-cell RNA-seq with whole-cell patch-clamp recording, we will identify central neurons that are upstream
or downstream of these temperature-sensitive POA neurons, to elucidate the central neuronal circuitry for
thermoregulation.
 To identify central neurons that receive input from temperature-sensitive POA neurons, we will use
trans-synaptic tracers, and further verify these synaptic connections by using the PGDS Cre-line to drive
channelrhodopsin expression in temperature-sensitive POA neurons for optogenetic activation in brain slices.
 To test whether specific neuronal types in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) innervate temperature-
sensitive POA neurons to modulate the circadian variation of body temperature, we will use Cre-lines for
these SCN neuronal types to drive trans-synaptic tracer expression. We will also use these Cre-lines to drive
channelrhodopsin expression in SCN neurons, and record from POA neurons to determine whether they
receive SCN input and whether their firing rate changes when the temperature of the brain slice is altered.
 In addition to identifying central neurons that are upstream or downstream of temperature-sensitive
POA neurons, this proposed project includes mechanistic studies on the nature of the signals used by
temperature-sensitive POA neurons to alter the activity of their downstream neurons so as to modulate body
temperature, to test the hypothesis that, besides classical transmitters, endogenous PGD2 mediates
thermoregulation. These studies will generate predictive models at a conceptual level of understanding
thermoregulation."

Black immigrants are poised to make up a significant portion of the Black older adult population
and similar to U.S. born Black older adults, are at risk of poor health outcomes related to
dementia. However, few efforts have culturally adapted dementia care and caregiving
interventions for racial/ethnic minority populations. Existing adaptations have not been
systematically conducted or documented, and have not focused on Black immigrants. The
objective of this K01 award is to acquire targeted training in the cultural adaptation and
feasibility testing of behavioral interventions for racial/ethnic minority older adults. The
candidate’s training goals are to: 1) Build expertise in dementia, cognitive impairment, and long-
term care for Black immigrant older adults; 2) Expand skills in the development, delivery, and
implementation of culturally relevant behavioral interventions for Black immigrants; 3) Design
and conduct a feasibility study with community dwelling older adults; 4) Apply advanced
statistical methods to analyze paired, longitudinal, pre-and post-test, and clinical trial data; and
5) Obtain the experience necessary to advance as a well-rounded successful independent
scientist (e.g. grant writing expertise, increased first-author peer-reviewed publications,
mentorship of junior scholars etc.). Mentored research training will occur in the context of a
dedicated project with these specific aims:1) Explore the experiences and care strategies used
by Black immigrant older adults with dementia and their informal caregivers. 2) Guided by the
Ecological Validity Model, use the knowledge gained from Aim 1 to culturally adapt the
evidenced-based Active Caregiving: Empowering Skills (ACES) for Black immigrant older adults
with dementia and their informal caregivers. 3) Determine the feasibility and acceptability of the
culturally adapted ACES intervention with Black immigrant older adults with dementia and their
informal caregivers. The candidate’s mentoring team has extensive expertise in these areas and
will offer mentoring, consultation, hands-on training, networking/collaborations and resources to
facilitate the candidate’s career development. The 2020 NIA Dementia Care Summit Gaps and
Opportunities highlights the need for research that explores differences in the effects of social
and cultural determinants of dementia care and caregiving. Completion of this research and
training meets this research need and will enable the candidate to become a successful
independent scientist with substantive expertise in dementia care and cultural adaptation of
interventions for racial/ethnic minority community-dwelling older adults. This is an important step
towards improving health outcomes and eliminating health inequities for these populations."

Links between cancer and metabolic dysfunction were first discovered almost a century ago. Evidence acquired
since indicates significant challenges remain in fully delineating those links and exploiting metabolism in the
diagnosis and treatment of cancer. City of Hope, an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center (COHCCC),
has an international reputation for basic and clinical research in both cancer and metabolism. It is complemented
by the unique strengths of the Beckman Research Institute (COHBRI) and the Arthur Riggs Diabetes &
Metabolism Research Institute. Together, this strong research infrastructure supports the postdoctoral Cancer
Metabolism Training Program (CMTP). The CMTP began in 2018; our goal is to train the next generation of
scientists to become experts in the use of cutting-edge science to interrogate cancer metabolism and to
contribute to improvements in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of cancer. Following a rigorous application
process with a personal interview, three T32-supported postdoctoral Trainees are selected for two years of
funding. To further recruitment, COHBRI funds up to three additional positions for each T32-supported Trainee
from an underrepresented group (URG) in the sciences (up to 6 total positions), supplements salaries for T32-
supported Trainees, and provides a stipend for research supplies for all Trainees. Further institutional support
comes from full administrative and faculty salary support. Shared Resource Facilities further stimulate the
research environment for Trainees by enabling access to cutting-edge research platforms. All CMTP Trainees
establish a Mentoring Committee with a least one physician to bring clinical problems into focus along with basic
research. The CMTP has 26 faculty Mentors, all of whom are performing high-impact cancer research and have
experience mentoring postdoctoral fellows. We have established a common curriculum that CMTP Trainees
follow to increase their future employment opportunities, which includes coursework, as well as participation in
local and international scientific symposia, journal clubs, seminars, informal meetings with Mentors, formal
Mentoring Committee meetings, and an annual meeting with our External Advisory Board. During the last five
years, we have supported 13 Trainees in the CMTP, including eight from URGs. To date, three CMTP Trainees
have become academic scientists. Our training program is unique as we are one of only four out of 181 NCI-
sponsored T32 training grants focused on cancer metabolism and is the only such program on the West Coast.
CMTP Trainees completing the program have had success in finding strong initial permanent positions. Based
on the critical need to delineate the links between metabolism and cancer, and building on our track-record of
training, placement of our initial group of Trainees, strong institutional support, and diversity of the catchment
area covered by the COHCCC, we are confident the CMTP will develop a diverse pool of highly trained,
productive scientists."
10844342,"Project Summary
The form (or shape) and function relationship of anatomical structures is a central theme in biology where abnor-
mal shape changes are closely tied to pathological functions. Morphometrics has been an indispensable quan-
titative tool in medical and biological sciences to study anatomical forms for more than 100 years. Recently, the
increased availability of high-resolution in-vivo images of anatomy has led to the development of a new generation
of morphometric approaches, called statistical shape modeling (SSM), that take advantage of modern computa-
tional techniques to model anatomical shapes and their variability within populations with unprecedented detail.
SSM stands to revolutionize morphometric analysis, but its widespread adoption is hindered by a number of sig-
niﬁcant challenges, including the complexity of the approaches and their increased computational requirements,
relative to traditional morphometrics. Arguably, however, the most important roadblock to more widespread adop-
tion is the lack of user-friendly and scalable software tools for a variety of anatomical surfaces that can be readily
incorporated into biomedical research labs. The goal of this proposal is thus to address these challenges in the
context of a ﬂexible and general SSM approach termed particle-based shape modeling (PSM), which automat-
ically constructs optimal statistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes without
relying on any speciﬁc surface parameterization. The proposed research will provide an automated, general-
purpose, and scalable computational solution for constructing shape models of general anatomy. In Aim 1, we
will build computational and machine learning algorithms to model anatomies with complex surface topologies
(e.g., surface openings and shared boundaries) and highly variable anatomical populations. In Aim 2, we will
introduce an end-to-end machine learning approach to extract statistical shape representation directly from im-
ages, requiring no parameter tuning, image pre-processing, or user assistance. In Aim 3, we will provide intuitive
graphical user interfaces and visualization tools to incorporate user-deﬁned modeling preferences and promote
the visual interpretation of shape models. We will also make use of recent advances in cloud computing to enable
researchers with limited computational resources and/or large cohorts to build and execute custom SSM work-
ﬂows using remote scalable computational resources. Algorithmic developments will be thoroughly evaluated and
validated using existing, fully funded, large-scale, and constantly growing databases of CT and MRI images lo-
cated on-site. Furthermore, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc use cases
for complex anatomies to promote reproducibility. Efforts to develop the proposed technology are aligned with
the mission of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), and its third strategic goal: to bridge
biology and quantitative science for better global health through supporting the development of and access to
computational research tools for biomedical research. Our long-term goal is to increase the clinical utility and
widespread adoption of SSM, and the proposed research will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal."
10844346,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite the availability of effective antiretroviral therapies, cognitive deficits persist in HIV-infected (HIV+)
individuals. For example, in the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), HIV+ virally suppressed (HIV+VS)
women showed neurocognitive impairment (NCI) in verbal learning and memory as well as working memory,
attention and executive function. These domains of cognitive performance relate to the declarative memory and
cognitive control subdomains of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), a framework that has not yet been
leveraged to advance understanding of the mechanisms contributing to patterns of NCI in HIV. There is a strong
scientific premise that HIV-associated brain injury stems from immunological processes, particularly
neuroinflammation, mediated by cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. In support of this view, studies by
our team and others demonstrate that NCI in HIV is associated with microglial activation and monocyte activation.
In this proposal, our multidisciplinary team will provide innovation to this line of inquiry by conducting a
longitudinal neuroimaging study that not only uses the RDoC framework but also assesses neuroinflammation.
Building on our cross-sectional neuroimaging studies, we will first use task-based functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) and resting state fMRI in HIV+VS individuals and HIV-uninfected individuals to identify the neural
circuitry contributing to deficits in declarative memory and cognitive control. Second, we will use positron
emission tomography (PET) to assess HIV-related alterations in chronic neuroinflammation in relation to NCI.
Third, we will computationally integrate the multimodal imaging data in relation to changes in cognitive
performance over time. To achieve our goal, we propose a single-site, longitudinal study in phenotypically well-
characterized HIV+VS (N=100) and HIV- controls (N=50) from the WIHS and Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study
(MACS). Participants will complete neuroimaging assessments (resting state and task-based fMRI, structural
MRI, diffusion-weighted MRI) annually for three years and cognitive assessments every six months over that
same time. The longitudinal design allows an assessment of the reproducibility of key findings over time and the
sensitivity of these neuroimaging measures to changes in cognitive performance. To examine HIV-related
alterations in chronic neuroinflammation, a subset of individuals (total n =42; 24 HIV+VS) will also complete PET
assessments using [11C]DPA-713 (DPA). In keeping with NIH research priorities, after 5 years of potential
funding, the impact of this R01 on the field will be to inform our understanding of the mechanisms linked to
neurological comorbidity and to provide novel, more sensitive neuroimaging biomarkers to guide testing of new
cognitive therapies for HIV+ individuals."

Funds are requested to support two slots in years 1-3 and four slots in years 4-5 for a new Medical Scientist
Training Program at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, Kansas. Our MD-PhD program,
which was founded in 1995, produced its first dual degree graduates in 2002. Our ongoing, overarching goal is
to recruit, retain, and develop a diverse group of physician-scientists to become leaders in biomedical research
and translational clinical practice. Short-term goals for MSTP-supported trainees mirror those for our other MD-
PhD trainees and include development of clinical, research, and communication skills, publication of research
results, submission of predoctoral fellowship proposals, and timely progression to degrees. Long-term goals for
training include participation in the biomedical workforce and success in obtaining extramural funding. We
matriculate ~3-5 students annually from a pool of ~80-90 nation-wide applicants. Recent successful applicants
have had an average of 20.7 months of research experience prior to matriculation. Our students have been
recruited from schools in 21 states across the country, and, historically, our recruitment of female students and
students from underrepresented groups has exceeded the national average for MD-PhD programs. Our
graduates have successfully competed for residencies at top academic medical schools. Among our alumni
who have entered the workforce are those with successful careers in industry, academia, and government. Our
success is based on strategic pairing of candidates with NIH funded basic and clinical science mentors, the
strong support from the institution and state, and the integrated training environment that we provide. Students
have training opportunities with faculty in 17 departments/programs and 31 different Centers and Institutes,
including the Cancer Center, the University of Kansas Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSA), and
Alzheimer's Disease Center, all three of which are NIH-funded, as well as with affiliated faculty at the renowned
private research facility, the Stowers Institute for Medical Research. Our training program follows a traditional
(2, 4, 2) training sequence. The first two years include training in an innovative medical curriculum based on
active learning, application of critical thinking skills, and case-based clinical problem solving. This curriculum is
supplemented with MD-PhD-specific courses in biostatistics, molecular medicine, and grant application
preparation, as well as monthly student research and clinical skills presentations. The PhD phase takes 4
years on average and is followed by completion of two years of clinical clerkships. Students have supervised
activities during PhD training to enhance clinical skills with clinical mentors, in our student-run free medical
clinic, and our clinical skills and simulation labs. Other program activities designed for both education and
development of group cohesion include training in the responsible conduct of research and scientific rigor and
data reproducibility throughout the program, an annual service project, an annual retreat, and social activities.
We are committed to providing training in an inclusive environment that promotes excellence."
10844609,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Polyamines are a class of small organic polycations indispensable for many basic molecular and cellular
processes including translation, electrical signaling, cell proliferation, and autophagy. Infectious and
hyperproliferative diseases as well as many autoimmune, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders are
deeply connected to perturbations in polyamine abundance. Polyamine transport plays a major role in cellular
polyamine homeostasis in both healthy and abnormal cells. Understanding the molecular basis of polyamine
uptake and secretion has enormous potential to improve human health. However, despite decades of work, this
subject continues to mystify. A critical barrier to deeper knowledge in polyamine transport is the complete
absence of atomic structures of any polyamine transporter. The goal of this project is to elucidate the fundamental
principles underlying polyamine transport and its regulation using a combination of structural and functional
approaches. ATP13A2 is a lysosomal P-type ATP-driven pump tasked with the import of spermine and
spermidine from the lysosome lumen to the cytosol. Mutations that cripple ATP13A2 function causes a spectrum
of neurodegenerative diseases including Kufor-Rakeb syndrome, early-onset Parkinson’s disease, hereditary
spastic paraplegia, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. ATP13A2 is, thus, a
potential drug target. We have made significant inroads in our preliminary studies to determine high-resolution
three-dimensional structures of human ATP13A2. In combination with functional analysis, these structures
revealed ATP13A2’s luminal gating and polyamine selectivity mechanisms. Building on these preliminary results,
we will leverage complementary electron cryo-microscopy, biophysical, biochemical, analytical chemical and
mutagenesis strategies to further subject ATP13A2 to detailed mechanistic scrutiny. Specifically, we aim to
investigate: 1) how lipids regulate ATP13A2 activity; 2) whether and how ATP13A2 pumps other cations into the
lysosome; and 3) how ATP13A2 shuttles polyamines through the lipid bilayer. By addressing these questions,
this research project will provide new insights into the basic operating and regulatory mechanisms of ATP13A2,
which will broadly advance our understanding of polyamine transport and lysosome physiology. Structural and
mechanistic discoveries from the proposed work may inform future rational design of therapeutics targeting
ATP13A2."

Leveraging our deep experience with conducting community-engaged research, the goal of the Building Access 
to Food through Systems and Solidarity (BASIS) Study is to improve diet by providing culturally appropriate food 
access and attending to drivers that limit the ability to achieve nutrition security in Sunset Park – a community of 
Mexican and Chinese American families in Brooklyn, NY that has been hard-hit during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
has lagged in economic recovery, and where residents are disconnected from government supports. 
Significance. Latinx and Asian American communities face unique, yet similar structural and social inequities 
contributing to poor diet quality, which have contributed to the increased burden of diabetes and non-alcoholic 
fatty liver disease in these groups. The past two years has exacerbated these barriers due to overt anti-immigrant 
and anti-Asian sentiment during the pandemic, invoking fear, cultural shame, and loss of a sense of security for 
these groups – factors which have fueled challenges towards accessing food and economic stability. 
Approach. Working collaboratively with four farming/gardening organizations, one elementary school and three 
community-based organizations, our aims are: 
Aim 1: To implement a whole-of-community intervention in Sunset Park for improving diet and the social/built
environments for low-income Mexican and Chinese American immigrants. The BASIS program will include inlanguage navigation for food business owners/residents to government assistance / workforce development 
programs; a subsidized fresh produce box program; gardening and nutrition education; and a social marketing 
campaign to promote healthy eating behavior changes and cultural awareness. Materials will be culturally 
appropriate and specific to each community, yet also highlight similarities across both groups. 
Aim 2: To evaluate the BASIS program impact at the community, interpersonal and individual levels . The 
evaluation plan will employ administrative data sources and mixed methods to assess outcomes at multiple 
levels. Outcomes will be assessed in Sunset Park and in 4 comparison communities that are predominantly 
Mexican and Chinese American (Corona, East Harlem; Chinatown, Elmhurst, respectively). We hypothesize that 
stability in the food retail sector and improvements in neighborhood social cohesion, diet, ethnic pride and sense 
of belonging will be observed in Sunset Park vs. comparison communities. 
Aim 3: To co-develop a multi-faceted sustainability strategy with multi-sector stakeholders. Sustainability is a 
central priority of the BASIS program and is driven by commitment to community priorities; investment in 
infrastructure and workforce development; and engagement in the local food policy dialogue. 
Impact.BASIS presents a powerful model to improve diet in immigrant communities by addressing determinants 
of food access in a community-centered, culturally competent way, and by fortifying community empowerment."

10844615,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Drosophila female reproductive tract is morphologically and functionally complex, and as the arena where
high-stakes interactions among multiple male ejaculates and female products play out, it is also likely subject
to strong and conflicting selection pressures. Moreover, the reproductive tract is the initiation site for a cascade
of post-mating responses in female biology, from sequestering sperm and ovipositing to changes in neural
gene expression and behavior. Many of these processes may undergo sexually antagonistic selection, as
outcomes affect the sexes’ divergent reproductive interests. Nevertheless, research investment in the lower
female reproductive tract, including the sperm storage organs and the female accessory glands, severely lags
investment in male reproductive tissues. For example, the seminal receptacle, uterus, and female accessory
glands have been excluded from every major community transcriptome analysis; resources like Gal-4 drivers
or marker gene labels generally do not exist for these tissues; and the function and evolution of several organs
remain poorly described. These omissions limit insight into a range of important questions, including the
mechanisms and evolution of female-ejaculate interactions, the extent of rapid evolution in reproductive tissues
and its drivers, and the outcomes of sexual conflict. Yet these omissions also highlight an opportunity for new
low-barrier, high return investigations using well-established technologies in a leading model organism, which
this proposal pursues. First, single-cell sequencing of mated and unmated females from two diverged natural
populations will be used to 1) characterize cell-type diversity in the female reproductive tract for the first time
and 2) measure gene expression and divergence in the 5 somatic female reproductive tissues at cellular
resolution (Specific Aim 1). These data will also test the hypothesis that gene expression in female
reproductive tissues diverges rapidly owing to coevolving interactions with seminal fluid proteins. Next, genes
that are candidates for important functional evolution will be knocked out and evaluated for reproductive
effects. Specific Aim 2 tests null alleles of 7 receptors that are expressed in the seminal receptacle and show
indications of rapid divergence, to test the hypothesis that these receptors mediate female post-mating
responses. Specific Aim 3 uses a set of de novo genes with novel expression in the seminal receptacle to
explore the mysterious process of gene birth and functional integration. Specifically, the de novo gene
candidates that appear most likely to be functionally integrated based on transcript length, expression level,
structural complexity, and other metrics, will be knocked out and evaluated for effects on female reproductive
function."
10844622,"Hundreds of millions of patients are exposed to general anesthetics (GAs) each year, making the heritable effects
of GAs a public health issue of paramount importance. The need to investigate the heritable effects of GAs and
develop preventative therapies is also indicated by an unprecedented rise, particularly in industrialized countries,
of neurodevelopmental disorders. The origin of most of these disorders is unknown and many are more common
in males. To form the basis for clinical studies on this topic, the proposed preclinical project will test the following
hypotheses regarding the mechanisms, therapeutic tools, and biomarkers pertaining to heritable effects of GAs:
1) GA-induced secretion of the steroid stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) is essential in the initiation of
epigenetic changes in parental germ cells (F0 generation) and, by extension, abnormalities in offspring (F1
generation); 2) both GABAergic GA-induced impairment of the K+-2Cl- (KCC2) Cl- exporter, resulting in
impairment of inhibitory GABAAR signaling, and an increase in CORT secretion are required for GA-induced F0
neurobehavioral defects; and 3) F1 males are more vulnerable because F0 GAs act via modification of male-
specific F1 brain masculinization. Aim 1: Determine the roles of KCC2 and CORT in the initiation of
intergenerational effects of sevoflurane (SEVO). Four clinically used GAs with partially overlapping mechanisms
of action, SEVO, propofol, ketamine and etomidate, will be used as pharmacological tools to determine the roles
of KCC2 and CORT. The F0 rats will be exposed to GAs on postnatal day (P) 56, P58, and P60 and mated on
P85 to generate offspring. The F0 and F1 rats will be evaluated in the elevated plus maze, prepulse inhibition of
startle*, Morris water maze, fear-potentiated startle, and forced swimming test and by assessing resting and
stress-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity*. Genome-wide DNA methylation in F0 and F1
germ cells and hippocampi and RNA-seq in F0 and F1 hippocampi and peripheral blood monocytes* will be used
to gain insight into epigenomic and transcriptomic mechanisms (* = will be evaluated as potential biomarkers for
future human studies). Aim 2: Determine whether shorter parental SEVO exposure that is not sufficient to induce
F0 neurobehavioral effects can induce F1 effects, and determine the roles of Cl- transporters and glucocorticoid
receptors (GRs). Hypotheses: Shorter F0 SEVO exposure is sufficient to upregulate the F0 HPA axis and
reprogram the germline, inducing F1 defects. KCC2 enhancement or Na+-K+-Cl- (NKCC1) and GR inhibition have
therapeutic effects. Aim 3: Determine the mechanisms of male-biased intergenerational effects of parental
exposure to SEVO. Hypotheses: F1 males are more vulnerable because F0 SEVO affects testosterone (T)-
regulated brain masculinization. Because T acts through 17β-estradiol (E2) at estrogen receptor α (ERα) and
via T-activated androgen receptors (ARs), we hypothesize that F1 ERα-/- (but not ERβ-/-) males and/or F1 wild
type males treated with the AR antagonist flutamide at birth will be less affected. KCC2 enhancement or NKCC1
and GR inhibition will alleviate the F0 SEVO-induced changes in F1 male mechanisms of brain masculinization."
10827440,"Abstrac t Opioid misuse is a major public health issue among young adults in the United States and is an
especially acute problem in rural communities. Critically, prevention efforts for opioid misuse that serve young
people often do not effectively involve them. Prevention organizations would benefit from an effective youth
engagement strategy to incorporate the voices of young people in planning prevention programs and policy.
Further, young adulthood is a formative time for positive social development; but unfortunately, many young
people feel isolated within communities, feel that they do not matter, and lack meaningful opportunities to
engage with society and form positive connections with prosocial institutions. Prevention organizations lack
evidence-based strategy to marshal the considerable resources that young adults can bring to strengthening
prevention efforts by increasing their meaning and relevance for young adults; at the same time, young adults
may be at risk for opioid misuse in part due to isolation and lack of meaningful opportunities for engagement in
their communities. Engaging young people to contribute to the prevention organizations targeting substance
use may prevent opioid misuse by targeting two pathways: (1) an environmental pathway whereby young
adults affect community systems and settings through improving prevention efforts and (2) an individual
pathway bolstering psychosocial protective factors and reducing risks for the young adults engaged in
prevention efforts. Aligned with NIDA's HEAL initiative and the 2016-2020 strategic plan Objective 2.2, this K01
proposal seeks to elucidate the environmental and individual pathways through which youth engagement can
prevent opioid misuse. The research component of this mentored career development award will develop and
test an organization-level prevention strategy for effectively integrating meaningful youth engagement
opportunities into multi-component prevention efforts. The project will identify which community-based
prevention organizations, and which subset of young adults, would most benefit from youth engagement as a
strategy for preventing opioid misuse (Aim 1); develop an organization-level youth engagement prevention
strategy and implement it with one community-based organization to test feasibility and acceptability (Aim 2);
and evaluate the preliminary effectiveness of youth engagement as an organization-level strategy for
preventing opioid misuse in a small pilot randomized controlled trial (Aim 3). The training component of this
award will allow me to develop critical skills in (1) community-based systems and settings for substance use
prevention targeting vulnerable young adults; (2) opioid misuse among young adults in rural settings; (3)
prevention intervention development; and (4) randomized clinical trials research. With guidance from an
outstanding mentor team, this K01 will fully prepare me to become an independent investigator with the skills
to carry out research yielding much-needed new strategies to mitigate the societal issue of opioid misuse
among young adults."
10845265,"Vaccination can be one of the most efficient and effective tools for controlling infectious diseases, but in many settings, including wildlife and farm animal diseases, logistical and economic hurdles make it impractical to vaccinate large enough fractions of hosts to achieve herd immunity. Transmissible vaccines, defined as vaccines capable of disseminating from vaccinated to non-vaccinated hosts, offer one potential solution to these challenges by amplifying the impact of vaccination campaigns. However, transmissible vaccines are not without risk. Reversion to virulence or recombination with wildtype pathogens could cause transmissible vaccines to make matters worse or complicate elimination efforts. This proposed work will for the first time quantify the effects of transmissible vaccines on disease ecology and evolution using an economically important, naturally transmissible vaccine currently in widespread use on poultry farms. Marek's disease, a poultry-specific disease that is a threat to sustainable poultry production, is currently controlled by the ""Rispens"" vaccine, a live, attenuated vaccine that has been widely used for two decades. Recent experiments have found that this vaccine is capable of efficiently transmitting from vaccinated to non-vaccinated birds. These results are consistent with recent field surveillance studies that have found vaccine isolates in cohorts that have not been directly vaccinated. In addition, advances in whole genome sequencing have revealed recombination between the vaccine virus and the wildtype virus, which is concerning given that the vaccine virus harbors highly virulent forms of the oncogenic meq gene. Together, these observations demonstrate that the Rispens vaccine is a transmissible vaccine capable of evolving and potentially facilitating adverse evolution of wildtype Marek's disease virus. Our primary objective is to quantify the consequences of transmissible vaccine use. Specifically, we will: 1) Develop a general model of transmissible vaccination to identify key knowledge gaps, 2) Characterize vaccine transmission and its impact on wildtype virus transmission, 3) Characterize the genetic evolution of wildtype virus and vaccine virus, 4) Model the overall impact of Rispens vaccination on Marek's disease virus and its vaccine"
10845305,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of vision loss in sports injury, and automobile accidents in
the United States, for which there currently is no treatment. Our long-term objective is to develop safe, innovative
strategies to combat vision loss from TBI. Mild TBI (mTBI), even without direct trauma to the eye, results in retinal
damage via microglia and Müller cell-driven inflammation, and dysfunction from loss of retinal ganglion cells
(RGCs). Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) extracellular vesicles (EVs) are rapidly emerging as a stem cell
alternative that promote immunomodulation, repair, and regeneration. MSC EVs injected into the vitreous in
rodents demonstrated tropism for RGCs, Müller cells, and microglia, and triggered specific cellular responses,
with micro RNA (miRNA) from the EVs playing a key role.
 Here we capitalize upon our published and preliminary data demonstrating that MSC EVs attenuate microglial
activation and RGC death in vitro. Anti-apoptosis and anti-inflammatory effects of MSC EVs were further boosted
by “supercharging” the EVs using hypoxic preconditioning of the parent MSCs, yielding “H-EVs.” MSC cell lines
were genetically altered to stably overexpress microRNAs in EVs (i.e., Functionally-Engineered EVs, or FEEs),
and FEEs mimicked the anti-apoptosis and anti-inflammatory action of H-EVs. This proposal targets interrupting
retinal damage from mild TBI with MSC-EVs containing function-specific miRNA to attenuate neuro-inflammation
and accompanying neuronal dysfunction and cell death. Our central hypothesis is that targeted EV-specific
expression of key miRNAs ameliorates microglia and Müller cell-driven inflammation, and loss of RGCs and
subsequent visual dysfunction from mTBI.
 Aim 1 engineers EVs mimicking functionality of H-EVs to attenuate microglia and Müller cell activation and
retinal neuron death in vitro. We hypothesize that FEEs enhance anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis effects of
MSC-EVs and mimic H-EVs. Two of the highest expressed miRs in H-EVs will be studied as FEEs in comparison
to MSC EVs, H-EVs, and controls in activated retinal microglia, and RGCs and Müller cells exposed to glutamate.
Identifying mechanisms of action of FEEs and H-EVs will provide a novel pathway to therapeutic precision
medicine for visual dysfunction in mTBI.
 Aim 2 determines in vivo anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis actions of FEEs in a clinically-relevant mouse
model of mTBI. We will test the hypothesis that FEEs administered into the vitreous rescue the retina when given
after mTBI. Retinal function, apoptosis, glutamate levels, and inflammatory mediators post mTBI using 50 psi
blast to the cranium will be quantitatively compared, and cell-specific effects identified in groups treated with H-
EVs, FEEs, MSC EVs, and controls.
 The proposed studies are expected to provide new results with MSC-EVs modified for protective action to
treat the retinal cells affected by TBI, and provide novel potential therapy for other neurodegenerative disorders."

 This is an application for a K08 for Dr. Joshua Gruber, an Instructor of Medicine at Stanford
University. Dr. Gruber wishes to establish himself as a clinician-scientist at the forefront of metabolite-
epigenetics crosstalk with a long-term goal of establishing novel drug targets for patients with early and
advanced stage malignancies. This K08 award will provide Dr. Gruber support to achieve the following
goals for career development: 1) Determine molecular mechanisms that drive histone acetyltransferase
1 (HAT1)-dependent malignancies; 2) Mechanistically characterize potential HAT1 activators and
inhibitors; 3) Identify mechanisms of how dietary fiber-derived propionate modifies chromatin. Dr.
Gruber will be mentored by Dr. Michael Snyder, an established expert in mass spectrometry approaches
including proteomics and metabolite quantitation. Dr. Gruber will be co-mentored by Dr. Calvin Kuo,
an expert in cancer biology and nutrient metabolism. Dr. Gruber has established a mentoring
committee including Dr. James Chen, Stanford Professor of Chemical and Systems biology to advise on
aspects of chemical biology; Dr. Mark Smith, director of the Medicinal Chemistry Knowledge Center;
Dr. Kevin Contrepois, Scientific Director of the Stanford Metabolic Health Center, to provide mass
spectrometry training; and Zena Werb, Professor of Anatomy, University of California San Francisco to
advise on experimental models of tumorigenesis and breast cancer biology.
 Cancer cell growth is coupled to nutrient metabolism to ensure adequate nutrients exist to fuel
cell division. Molecular metabolite sensors allow for cells to respond to changes in nutrient availability.
Acetyl-co-A is a critical metabolite for biosynthetic processes, signaling and epigenetics. However,
metabolite sensors of acetate and other acyl-containing metabolites are poorly understood. Therefore,
an improved understanding of acetyl-co-A sensing may allow for the development of novel approaches
to diagnose, treat or prevent malignancy. Dr. Gruber has identified the histone acetyltransferase HAT1
as a potential sensor of acetyl-co-A and acyl-containing short chain fatty acids. To identify exploitable
properties of the HAT1 metabolite-sensing pathway, Dr. Gruber plans a detailed molecular
investigation of HAT1-dependency in human tumors to provide an understanding of the properties that
make HAT1 a potential anti-cancer drug target (aim 1). To advance the ability to manipulate HAT1
catalytic activity, Dr. Gruber has screened for small molecule chemical activators and inhibitors, which
will be biochemically characterized (aim 2). Finally, he plans to define mechanisms by which HAT1
incorporates short-chain fatty acids to chromatin (aim 3). This research will provide scientific
foundations and essential career training to lead to an independent academic research position for Dr.
Gruber with the expectation of R01-level funding by the conclusion of the K award period."
10848966,"Investigating the role of Ikaros variant in multiple myeloma pathophysiology and drug sensitivity
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a complex and heterogeneous disease in which malignant plasma cells grow and
accumulate within bone marrow, causing end-organ dysfunctions and morbidity. Although survival in MM has
improved significantly, acquisition of resistance in MM patients results in relapse thereby leading to challenges
in disease management. Thus, better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying the disease is required
for identification of novel resistance/sensitivity prognostic markers. The initial impact in MM treatment came from
the introduction of lenalidomide. Lenalidomide causes selective ubiquitination and degradation of two lymphoid
transcription factors, Ikaros (IKZF1) and Aiolos (IKZF3), by the Cereblon ubiquitin ligase. This established the
dependency of MM cells on IKZF1 for their sustained proliferation and survival. Also, IKZF1 is a critical regulator
of lymphocyte development and differentiation. It is known to act both as activator and repressor of gene
transcription. While examining the differences in 3' end RNA processing between MM patients and normal
plasma cells, it was surprising to find that normal plasma cells express high levels of an IKZF1 variant which is
lost in a group of MM patients. Patients exhibiting this loss also had shorter progression-free survival. As this
variant is generated by combination of alternative splicing and early cleavage and polyadenylation in the intron
of the gene, it is referred as Ikaros intronic cleavage and polyadenylation isoform (IKZF1-IPA). IKZF1-IPA lacks
five 3' exons but contains two alternate 3' exons, and it thus differs in its 3' coding region and 3' untranslated
region (3' UTR), compared to IKZF1-full-length (IKZF1-FL). The encoded IKZF1-IPA has a distinct C-terminus,
which is significantly shorter than IKZF1-FL and lacks all the known DNA binding as well as homo- and hetero-
dimerization domains. Based on these findings and well-established oncogenic role of IKZF1-FL, it is
hypothesized that loss of IKZF1-IPA could contribute to MM pathogenesis by increasing oncogenic IKZF1-FL
levels and loss of tumour suppressive activity of IKZF1-IPA. Another hypothesis is that MM cells exhibit different
sensitives to lenalidomide treatment in presence or absence of IKZF1-IPA. Thus, in AIM1, how loss of IKZF1-
IPA promotes MM pathophysiology will be investigated. As IKZF1-IPA exhibits limited similarity to known IKZF1
isoforms, there is lack of understanding about the binding partners of IKZF1-IPA and its localization preferences.
Identifying its binding partners will provide insight about its molecular modus operandi. It has been demonstrated
that the interaction between IKZF1-FL and other IKZF1 variants impacts its chromatin remodeling activity. Thus,
in AIM 2, the role of IKZF1-IPA in shaping epigenetic landscape, its binding partners and its localization
preferences will be investigated. Understanding the functional role of IKZF1-IPA in MM will advance knowledge
about the resistance and sensitivity pathways in MM. It will also allow to determine if IKZF1-IPA can serve as a
prognostic marker for MM treatment and response. Given the central role of IKZF1 in development, disease, and
treatment, the knowledge gained from this study can be extended to other diseases and malignancies."
10849032,"Project Summary/Abstract
There has been a significant decline in the number of research psychiatrists and research fellowships for
psychiatrists in the past decades. To address this gap, it is critically important to provide early research
training in psychiatry residency. Such training (a) promotes research literacy for all trainees, (b) encourages
future participation of clinicians as research collaborators, (c) provides experience that can foster choosing a
research career, (d) expands clinical knowledge through the formulation of patient- oriented research
questions, (e) attracts medical students into psychiatry training, and (f) maintains and facilitates research
interest among residents with investigative backgrounds (IOM 2003). In response to this need, investigators at
the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Department of Psychiatry and McLean Hospital collaborated with
the leadership of the MGH/McLean General Adult Psychiatry Residency to develop a Physician Scientist
Training Program (PSTP) within the residency training program. The goal of the PSTP is to prepare residents
from diverse backgrounds for careers as investigators in academic psychiatry by facilitating greater exposure
to research activities and training during residency. The PSTP has been successful in attracting and recruiting
talented physician-scientists and has developed an effective research education program with appropriate
infrastructure attracting clinician-scientists to psychiatry careers. It has provided them both mentorship and
research experience to prepare for independent careers in psychiatry combined with neuroscience, genetics,
and public health after residency. We wish to further this success in the current application with program goals
to: (1) attract, train, and retain excellent residents to become future psychiatrist-investigators in basic,
translational, and patient-oriented research during the four years of residency training, with an ultimate goal of
retaining physician-scientists for those with formal graduate training and recruiting and developing physician-
scientists for those without it; (2) provide dedicated time and training for research over the course of the four-
year adult psychiatry residency training program; (3) increase the number of residents who benefit from the
research education program; (4) broaden and deepen the research education program by providing greater
and more intensive training in research literacy to all residents in the residency training program; (5) provide
seed funding for pilot research projects designed by PSTP residents; and (6) partner with training programs
within MGH and McLean Hospital as well as Harvard Catalyst, the Clinical and Translational Science Center
(CTSC), and the Broad Institute, so all residents will benefit from these educational resources. The new
specific aims for this application are to (1) strengthen the core PSTP curriculum for trainees with a diverse
range of research interests and levels of formal research training, (2) expand research support to trainees from
underrepresented backgrounds, and (3) establish an iterative process for trainee and program evaluation and
ongoing improvement in a rapidly changing world."
10849042,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The Yale Cancer Center Advanced Training Program for Physician-scientists (YCC-ATPP) was initially
funded in 2019. It is a training program designed for YCC Hematology/Medical Oncology (Heme/MedOnc)
fellows, with the aim of preparing them for careers as independent physician-scientists in cancer-related
research. Given the remarkable advancements and opportunities in hematology and oncology, the involvement
of well-trained physician-scientists who have expertise in both clinical aspects of the disease and fundamental
cancer biology is indispensable for advancing medical research and enhancing patient outcomes.
 While many of our Heme/MedOnc fellows aspire to become physician-scientists, they encounter
various challenges, including limited dedicated research time, restricted funding opportunities, and difficulties in
accessing personalized training and mentorship. The YCC-ATPP plays a vital role in nurturing the next
generation of physician-scientists by addressing these challenges head-on. The YCC-ATPP leverages the
abundant resources available at Yale and tailors its training to the specific needs of each fellow. Through the
program, T32 fellows receive protected research time, funding support, and mentorship from a three-member
Mentor Team dedicated to guiding their research projects and career development. Additionally, the YCC-
ATPP offers specialized didactic courses, opportunities to mentor students and residents in the summer
Diversity Enhancement Program in Oncology, community outreach and engagement initiatives, and transitional
pathways to help T32 graduates establish a strong foundation for their future careers as physician-scientists.
 Since its initial funding in 2019, we have successfully recruited a total of 12 fellows, including three
(25%) underrepresented in medicine (URiM) trainees. Among them, eight have already graduated from the
YCC-ATPP Program, with four of them receiving promotions to Assistant Professor and three continuing their
training in other programs. Currently, we have four trainees enrolled in the program. Furthermore, we have
three trainees who are pursuing their PhD degrees through the Investigative Medicine Program, which receives
partial support from the YCC-ATPP. All our fellows are highly committed to achieving their research goals, as
evidenced by their achievements. Out of the 12 fellows, only one current trainee does not have publications,
while the remaining 11 trainees have collectively published a total of 60 publications, including 56 peer-
reviewed journal papers and four book chapters. Among these publications, 24 are first-author publications,
comprising 22 peer-reviewed papers and two book chapters. Additionally, our trainees have received
subsequent awards, honors, and have actively engaged in teaching, mentoring, leadership roles, community
outreach, and other impactful endeavors. The YCC-ATPP significantly impacts the YCC by advancing
research, improving patient care, fostering collaborations, and bringing innovative treatments to the clinic."

leaders of multidisciplinary research projects that seek to understand the role that environmental exposures play
in the etiology and exacerbation of human disease and apply this knowledge to develop prevention and
intervention strategies. The EHETG training program is uniquely situated to make important contributions by
being anchored within the dynamic, collaborative atmosphere at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public
Health (BSPH) and has received significant institutional support for the program, that has greatly enhanced the
training mission. Our multi-disciplinary mentoring team (27) derived from multiple departments across BSPH (3)
and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine (2) has substantial funding that provides a wealth of opportunities for
original research by both pre- and postdoctoral trainees. Our predoctoral trainees will participate in: 1) a rigorous,
core curriculum in environmental health sciences that provides the academic foundation for environmental health
scientists (epidemiologic methods, exposure sciences, toxicology, biostatistics and advanced data science
skills); 2) specialized innovative coursework in one of 3 focus areas (environmental exposures and environmental
epidemiology (ESSE); toxicology, physiology, molecular mechanisms (TPMM), and environmental sustainability,
resilience and health (ESRH) that support dissertation research; and 3) dissertation research. All trainees receive
instruction in the use of cutting-edge technologies, advanced data sciences, Responsible Conduct of Research,
grant writing, Research Communications, and have access to career development activities. The research being
conducted by the mentor-trainee teams address one or more of the following topics: (a) Defining the
environmental exposures linked to human disease; (b) Mechanisms of disease pathobiology; (c) Development
and application of biomarkers of pathobiology; (d) Determination of the health impacts and vulnerability of
populations to climate change; and (e) Development of intervention and mitigation strategies to create healthy
sustainable communities. In this renewal application, we request critical support for 3-4 pre-doctoral
students/year and 4 post-doctoral trainees/year for the Training Program in Environmental Health Sciences."

The incidence of congenital heart defects (CHDs) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with fetal alcohol
spectrum disorder (FASD) are poorly characterized. Cardiovascular abnormalities may be common in FASD;
however, comprehensive retrospective studies on lifetime CVD risk in adult patient cohorts have yet to be
performed. Cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying FASD-mediated CHD and CVD are also largely
unknown along with any biomarkers that would allow the patient population to be stratified based on CVD risk.
Here we present preliminary data from our retrospective clinic cohort that demonstrate that females with FASD
have an overall increase in CHD, myocardial infarction (MI) rate, and the likelihood of being diagnosed with any
CVD in adulthood. Females with FASD also have significantly reduced ejection fraction relative to matched
controls. These data suggest that FASD is a risk factor for CHD in newborns and CVD in adults. In a zebrafish
model of embryonic alcohol exposure (EAE), we confirmed a primary defect in cardiomyocyte migration that
causes subsequent functional and structural heart abnormalities, including contractility deficits and ventricular
wall abnormalities that persist through adulthood. Our findings indicate that EAE zebrafish can serve as a model
for lifelong cardiac function in the presence and absence of CHD. We propose three Specific Aims to test the
central hypothesis that FASD patients have an increased incidence of CVD and that the zebrafish EAE model
will uncover novel molecular mediators and biomarkers that explain and predict CVD risk. In Specific Aim 1, we
will perform a retrospective study to determine CVD incidence in an adult FASD patient cohort, including CHD,
hypertension, cardiomyopathy, MI, cerebrovascular accident, and embolism, as well as their association with
other metabolic and inflammatory conditions. In Specific Aim 2, we will define molecular mechanisms underlying
embryonic heart defects in a zebrafish EAE model by identifying and functionally evaluating the impact of
molecular alterations in migratory myl7+ cardiomyocytes that form the cardiac cone through hypothesis-driven
(PDGF pathway) and unbiased (bulk RNA-sequencing on FACS-isolated myl7+ cardiomyocytes) approaches.
In Specific Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that EAE adults with a CHD are susceptible to cardiac dysfunction
and cardiomyopathy due to lasting alterations in cardiac structure, function, and molecular signature. Taken
together, the proposed studies will provide fundamental insights into the cardiovascular health outcomes of
patients with FASD, reveal novel molecular mediators of EtOH-induced CHDs, and identify biomarkers of adult
cardiac dysfunction in EAE adults. Cardiovascular diseases may contribute significantly to morbidity and
mortality in affected patients. By identifying which CVD outcomes impact FASD patients and what additional
metabolic and inflammatory factors indicate risk, we will provide an opportunity for early intervention. Further,
identification of molecular mediators of CHD and cardiomyopathy in a zebrafish model of EAE will allow us to
expand our mechanistic understanding of the effects of PAE across the lifespan."

Nearly 94% of breast cancer survivors experience one or more symptoms during or after endocrine therapy.
Joint pain, hot flashes, sleep disturbance, fatigue, depression, and anxiety are the most common concurrent
symptoms, some of which can persist for 5 to 10 years. These symptoms negatively affect adherence to
treatment and compromise people’s functional status, quality of life, and work functioning. Acupuncture is a
single therapy with few side effects that holistically addresses multiple symptoms. The effect of acupuncture
on multiple symptoms among breast cancer survivors receiving endocrine therapy has not been investigated.
Further, implementation-focused acupuncture research focuses on privately insured clinic settings and
ignores social determinants of health. There is an urgent need to remove barriers and ensure
equal access to this evidence-based treatment among breast cancer survivors with limited access to
acupuncture. Federally qualified health centers (FQHC) provide care to people who experience significant
barriers to health care access. To date, limited data exist about the use of acupuncture among cancer
survivors attending FQHCs. This research study has 2 aims: (1) to test the feasibility and acceptability of
implementing acupuncture within an FQHC oncology clinic as a way to manage multiple symptoms (pain, hot
flashes, fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety) among breast cancer survivors receiving endocrine
therapy, and (2) to use a mixed methods approach to identify barriers and facilitators associated with the
implementation of acupuncture within an FQHC. The long-term goal is to facilitate the widespread
implementation, dissemination, and sustained utilization of acupuncture for symptom management among
medically underserved breast cancer survivors receiving endocrine therapy in FQHCs nationwide, and
ultimately to promote broader insurance coverage for acupuncture. The proposed research is significant
because of its potential to ensure equal access acupuncture, an evidence-based intervention. Results will
provide the foundation for a larger multi-site hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial of integrating
acupuncture into services provided at FQHCs for breast cancer survivors."

Over the past 5 years, The Ohio State University College of Nursing T32 has provided pre-doctoral research
training on health development for 10 trainees. We have demonstrated an ability to link trainees with research
intensive mentors and as the only T32 funded by NINR with a focus solely on health development during
childhood, we have been able to emphasize the unique determinants of health that are initiated early in life. In
this revised competing renewal application, we will continue to provide training in the science of health
development with an expansion to include training across the life span consistent with our conceptual model
and the strengths of our faculty. Through a combination of didactic coursework, directed research residencies,
mentorship, skill-building workshops, research seminars, and independent research projects, fellows will
develop competencies to conduct state-of-the-art research in the science of health development. Senior
research mentors will guide trainees in their studies and will work closely with trainees to study how health
determinants intersect to influence health development, and to use this knowledge to examine ways to
optimize wellness outcomes. Training faculty are from the nursing, sociology, and medicine. Faculty have
active research programs related to health determinants, mechanistic processes, and/or health outcomes. The
specific aims of this training program are to: recruit and retain diverse and qualified trainees pre- and post-
doctoral trainees to conduct rigorous research in the science of health development; prepare trainees to
develop and implement ethical health research in the science of health development; provide scientific
grounding and research experiences with highly qualified faculty and using extensively available resources to
prepare trainees for research careers; and increase the number and strengthen the scientific foundation of
early career nurse scientists. We propose eight pre-doctoral trainees, four post-baccalaureate trainees and
four post-master’s trainees with three and two years of support, respectively). We propose four post-doctoral
trainees, each with two years of support. Achievement of specific aims will occur through coursework,
participation in ongoing faculty research, conduct of research by the trainee, participation in research seminars
and national conferences, grantsmanship training, publication and presentation support, and research
dissemination experiences with faculty. This training program builds on research strengths of the faculty at The
Ohio State University (OSU) College of Nursing (CON) in health development during pregnancy, childhood,
and across the life span, health determinants and their effect on health and wellness. Research will particularly
focus on health development during sensitive and critical periods, mechanisms by which health determinants
influence health and wellness, and interventions aimed at improving health and wellness."
10837115,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Plants have been an important source of medicinal natural products, as ~25% of FDA-approved drugs are
inspired by plant chemicals. However, discovery and development of new pharmaceuticals based on plant
natural products is challenging due to three main bottlenecks: (1) rediscovery of known compounds from complex
plant extracts during bioactivity-guided discovery approaches, (2) difficult scaled production of chemically
complex lead structures by organic synthesis or source plant extraction, and (3) limited diversification of lead
structures due to molecular complexity. Recent advances in plant omics-technologies and plant synthetic biology
offer solutions to these general bottlenecks of natural product drug discovery by a gene-guided discovery
approach. Herein, prioritization of new plant metabolites can be enabled by mass spectrometry (MS)-based
metabolomics of plant extracts and prediction of biosynthetic genes from plant genomes. Heterologous
expression of biosynthetic genes allows source-independent production of target plant natural products in
microbial and eukaryotic host organisms. Genetic modification of biosynthetic pathways enables the formation
of target natural product analogs. Cyclic plant peptides are a class of plant natural products with potential
applications in antiviral and anticancer therapy due to oral bioavailability, stability and diversifiability. Our lab
recently characterized a new plant-specific peptide cyclase called the BURP domain, which is an autocatalytic
copper-dependent enzyme family involved in the biosynthesis of ribsomally encoded and posttranslationally
modified peptides (RiPPs) with side-chain-macrocyclizations via tyrosines and tryptophans. Our objective is to
overcome the aforementioned bottlenecks of plant-based drug discovery by developing a workflow for the
systematic discovery of cyclic peptides from plants, characterizing BURP domain peptide cyclases for scaled in
vivo or in vitro production of cyclic plant peptides and establishing a biocatalytic platform for the diversification of
cyclic plant peptides via BURP domain cyclases for therapeutic evaluation. Herein, systematic identification of
new side-chain-macrocyclic RiPP classes will be accomplished by connecting tandem MS spectra of candidate
peptide analytes to BURP domain genes in plant genomes and transcriptomes. We will investigate the structure
and function of known autocatalytic classes of BURP domain peptide cyclases, characterize BURP domain
peptide cyclases, which act on separate precursor peptide substrates and identify enzymes involved in N- and
C-terminal protection of BURP-domain-derived RiPPs. Finally, libraries of antiviral cyclopeptide alkaloids from
Chinese date tree (Ziziphus jujuba) and anticancer celogentin peptides from Celosia argentea will be generated
by design and optimization of biocatalytic routes and evaluated in in vivo cell-based assays. As plant genomic
resources are rapidly growing, the proposed research will set the stage for using plant genetic information for
the discovery and development of medicinal plant natural products."

Despite treatment advances over the past decade, five-year survival rates for metastatic melanoma remain low
(23%). BRAF mutations occur in 50-75% of melanoma, and a combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors (BRAFi,
MEKi) are effective therapies; however, acquired resistance rapidly develops for most patients. Research over
the past decade has identified mechanisms by which melanoma cells develop resistance to BRAF/MEK
inhibitors, but thus far, there are no FDA-approved regimens that reverse BRAFi/MEKi resistance and increase
the 5-year survival rate. Here, we demonstrate that the activities of the ABL family of non-receptor tyrosine
kinases are potentiated following BRAFi or BRAFi/MEKi resistance, and ABL1/2 drive resistance. Moreover,
targeting ABL1/2 with an FDA-approved anti-leukemia drug, nilotinib, dramatically reverses BRAFi/MEKi
(dabrafenib/trametinib) resistance, in vivo, inducing prolonged tumor regression. Based on these exciting
findings, the central hypothesis of our proposal is that ABL1/2 are key nodes that activate ERK-dependent or
-independent pathways to drive BRAFi/MEKi resistance; thus, targeting ABL1/2 may be effective for overcoming
resistance and ultimately extending survival for patients with treatment-refractory melanomas. Our long-term,
translational goal is to develop a novel regimen to improve the 5-year survival rate for patients with metastatic
melanoma. We propose a comprehensive hypothesis-driven experimental design and multi-disciplinary
approach. Aim 1 will define mechanisms by which ABL1/2 drive resistance. To achieve our objective,
biochemical, molecular biological and cell biological approaches using parental/resistant melanoma cell lines,
pharmacological inhibitors/RNAi, mass spectrometry, xenograft, GEM, PDX, and syngeneic in vivo approaches,
as well as human tissue collected from the clinical trial (Aim 3) will be used to test the hypothesis that ABL1/2
drive MAP3K activation of MEK/ERK/MYC (ERK-dependent resistance); induce ERBB2/ERBB3 activation of
PI3K/AKT (ERK-independent resistance); and alter immune cell infiltration. In Aim 2, conditioned medium from
parental/resistant cell lines, co-culture experiments using in vitro and in vivo models, and serum collected from
animals and patients will be used to test the prediction that the ABL1/2-driven secretome contributes to
BRAFi/MEKi resistance. Finally, Aim 3 is a multi-site, seamless Phase I/II clinical trial that tests the safety of
combining nilotinib with dabrafenib+trametinib (BRAFi/MEKi) for treatment-refractory patients. Additional
endpoints include identifying the recommended Phase II dose, initial efficacy (PFS) based on Phase II data,
PK/PD studies, and initial exploratory biomarker development. Results from these studies not only will increase
our understanding for how melanomas resist the effects of BRAFi/MEKi but also will lay the groundwork for a
large, multi-center, randomized clinical trial."
10832616,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Affective anxiety is characterized by behavioral inhibition accompanied by cognitive arousal and vigilance,
reflecting a future-oriented emotional state. Anxiety is an adaptive response to perceived threat; however,
chronic anxiety is debilitating, and anxiety disorders are the most common type of mental illness in the United
States. Identification of neural circuits that underlie behavioral responses to threat in animal models is essential
for understanding neurobiological mechanisms that contribute to normative and pathological anxiety in
humans. Basic and clinical research has emphasized the importance of the central nucleus of the amygdala
(CEA) and the anterolateral bed nucleus of stria terminalis (alBST) in regulating affective and physiological
components of anxiety. The CEA and alBST are heavily interconnected and share many common sources of
input, including input from caudal brainstem neurons that convey sensory feedback from body to brain; this
feedback strongly modulates emotional state, including threat responses. The proposed research will test new
hypotheses regarding the organization and behavioral role of CEA/alBST-projecting brainstem neurons that
express glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1). GLP1 neurons are activated to express cFos in rats after acute threat,
and GLP1 receptor signaling in the CEA/alBST increases arousal/vigilance and behavioral inhibition/avoidance
in rats, akin to anxiety in humans. We recently developed a transgenic Sprague Dawley rat (Gcg-Cre) in which
Cre is efficiently and selectively expressed by GLP1 neurons in the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract and
intermediate reticular nucleus (i.e., NTS/IRtGLP1 neurons). Using validated viral tools and behavioral assays in
this new model organism, we will conduct comparative analyses of the synaptic connectivity and functional role
of NTS/IRtGLP1à CEA/alBST circuits in male and female Gcg-Cre rats, including documentation of potential sex
differences. Since the distribution of GLP1 neurons in brainstem and GLP1 receptors in limbic forebrain
appears similar in rats and humans, results from this basic science project have potential translational
relevance for understanding neurobiological bases of normal and pathological symptoms of anxiety in humans."

Skeletal muscle atrophy occurs as a consequence of many chronic diseases and conditions such as
disuse. Central to the process of muscle atrophy is protein degradation, for which the E3 ubiquitin
ligases are critical in targeting specific proteins for degradation. The roles of many E3 ubiquitin
ligases in muscle are unknown and specific substrates have yet to be identified. The overall objective
of this proposal is to determine the role of the E3 ligase, F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 22
(Fbxl22), in skeletal muscle atrophy. My central hypothesis is that Fbxl22 is necessary for the
process of muscle atrophy. Robust preliminary data supports this hypothesis: 1) Fbxl22 mRNA
expression is induced after 3 days in a model of neurogenic muscle atrophy, 2) Overexpression of
Fbxl22 in hindlimb muscles results in significant elevations of total ubiquitinated proteins. I propose
two specific aims:
 Specific Aim 1: Determine the functional role of Fbxl22 isoforms in skeletal muscle atrophy,
injury and regrowth. I will address this aim using knockdown and overexpression of Fbxl22 gene
isoforms in a model of neurogenic muscle atrophy and assess Fbxl22 isoform expression in an acute
muscle injury model.
 Specific Aim 2: To identify substrate targets for Fbxl22-dependent ubiquitination. I will
address this aim using a combined approach of Fbxl22 gene manipulation with proteomics analysis
and post-translational modification identification of ubiquitin motifs on Fbxl22-dependent substrates.
 With the completion of this proposal, I expect to have identified novel mechanisms for
understanding the muscle atrophy process. By identifying the mechanisms of skeletal muscle
atrophy, we can explore new therapeutic strategies for improving an individual’s quality of life where
muscle wasting is present.
 The University of Iowa has a longstanding history of support to its trainees and junior faculty.
My mentor, Prof. Bodine is a world leader in skeletal muscle physiology, atrophy and hypertrophy.
This K01 award will expand my research skills in ubiquitin proteomics and skeletal muscle atrophy.
These tools may enable the identification of new therapeutic strategies for alleviating the detrimental
impact of skeletal muscle wasting."
10832525,"Unnecessary antibiotic use is a threat to public health and to each individual patient. Reducing unnecessary
use, or antibiotic stewardship, is essential to preserving the effectiveness of antibiotics now and for future
generations. Recent national mandates underscore the importance of establishing antibiotic stewardship
programs in hospitals and nursing homes, but we do not know the best way to implement antibiotic
stewardship on a wide scale and under real-world conditions. Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), a condition in
which the patient has bacteria colonizing the bladder without any urinary symptoms, is very common condition
in hospitalized patients and nursing home residents. ASB is often confused with urinary tract infection (UTI),
but ASB, unlike UTI, is clinically insignificant and should not be treated with antibiotics. Unnecessary screening
for and treatment of ASB is a major driver of unnecessary antibiotic use in hospitals and nursing homes. We
have developed an effective intervention to implement evidence-based antibiotic stewardship guidelines for
ASB through successive research projects. We now propose to use this tool to assess the relative merits of
two large-scale implementation strategies, a virtual learning collaborative (with group learning opportunities)
compared to technical assistance (individualized support available on request). These two implementation
strategies are widely used, but randomized, controlled trials of their effectiveness compared to each other are
rare. In this trial we will test the two implementation strategies and observe clinical outcomes. We will
randomize VA hospitals that provide both hospital and nursing home care to one of the two implementation
strategies. VA hospitals will be recruited in partnership with the VA Antimicrobial Stewardship Task Force
(ASTF), an organization dedicated to expanding antibiotic stewardship activities across all VA sites. We base
our plans on a learning health cycle, in which we share data about urine culture orders and antibiotic use with a
lead person at each hospital to generate knowledge, which leads to fewer urine culture orders and fewer days
of antibiotics, and behavior change leads to improved performance. Our five-year project will take
approximately 20-25 hospitals through one cycle of change, while building capacity for cycles to continue after
the project ends. The work will occur through three aims: (Aim 1) Assess context and resources for
implementation. (Aim 2) Compare a virtual learning collaborative versus technical assistance as
implementation strategies in a cluster randomized trial. The primary outcome is minutes spent in delivery of
the intervention, but we will also assess effectiveness through decreased urine cultures and antibiotic use. We
will explore stakeholder satisfaction with and sustainability of implementation strategies through qualitative
methods. (Aim 3) is to assess the cost implications of the implementation strategies through budget impact
analysis. Through this trial, we will add to knowledge about using wide scale implementation strategies and
making antibiotic stewardship programs successful in real-world settings."
10832530,"Summary Statement/Abstract
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common demyelinating disease, affecting approximately 400,000 people in the
United States and 2.5 million people worldwide. It is not clear what causes MS, but many believe that it is because
our own immune system attacks oligodendrocytes that generate myelin. However, the current therapies that dampen
our immune system can only relieve the symptoms but not cure the disease itself. Therefore, it is urgent to find novel
therapeutic approaches that can cure the disease, for instance by promoting remyelination. The central nervous
system has great potential to regenerate oligodendrocytes and remyelinate in response to myelin damage, however
the ability of remyelination is greatly diminished in the MS lesions. Two major reasons are known to prevent efficient
remyelination in MS lesions: 1) damaged myelin cannot be efficiently cleared, thereby preventing formation of new
oligodendrocytes, and 2) newly generated and/or existing oligodendrocytes have lost the ability to form new myelin.
We have identified a key regulator – Quaking (protein name: Qki; gene name: Qk) – that is potent to overcome both
obstacles. Firstly, we discovered that Qki is a key regulator of phagocytosis of microglia. Depletion of Qki in microglia
greatly reduced the phagocytic activity of microglia, which is critical for clearance of myelin debris and consequently
remyelination. Secondly, we discovered that Qki is a major regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin
homeostasis by regulating lipid metabolism of both newly formed oligodendrocytes and existing oligodendrocytes in
the demyelinating lesions. Mature myelin has been considered an inert material for decades. However, our study
showed that mature myelin is in fact a very dynamic material through exploiting our genetic systems by depleting
Qki in mature myelinating oligodendrocytes of adult mice. The comparative lipidomic and transcriptomic analyses
identified Qki as an essential factor for myelin lipid biosynthesis by controlling the transcription of the lipid metabolism
genes, particularly those for fatty acid desaturation and elongation, via coactivation of the peroxisome proliferator-
activated receptor beta (PPARβ)-retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα) complex. These findings were corroborated by
functional rescue experiments with brain penetrant PPARβ/RXRα agonists, KD3010 and bexarotene. We
hypothesize that restoring lipid metabolism by activating PPARβ/RXRα/Qki function will help remyelination in MS
through two ways: 1) activating microglia’s function to clear myelin debris, consequently promoting oligodendrocyte
regeneration, and 2) enhancing lipid generation of existing and newly generated oligodendrocytes. To test this
hypothesis, we propose the following three specific aims. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following three
specific aims: 1) To investigate the role of Qki/PPARβ in microglial phagocytosis in clearing myelin debris and
promoting remyelination, 2) to investigate the role of Qki/PPARβ in myelin lipid metabolism and remyelination, and
3) to elucidate the mechanism by which Qki functions as a coactivator to enhance PPARβ transcription activity in
both microglia and oligodendrocytes. Our studies will not only provide insights into the etiological mechanism for
MS, but more importantly, help MS patients find a cure through targeting remyelinating pathway."
10833045,"Illness and death caused by infectious diarrheal disease agents, like Vibrio cholerae, are major threats to
public health and significant barriers to socioeconomic development worldwide. Natural disasters and
continuing conflict in some depressed regions threaten to exacerbate the already rising incidence of cholera
globally. As the focus of several elegant studies documenting genomic changes in epidemic strains over the
last century, V. cholerae has become a well-studied model for pathogen evolution. Despite this, the
mechanisms and driving forces underlying historical and current changes are not yet understood. The arms
race between viruses and their host organisms is a key driving force in the evolution of all cellular life. Indeed
V. cholerae must defend against the ubiquitous threat of predatory phages in aquatic reservoirs and in the
intestinal tract during disease in humans. Our laboratory has shown that V. cholerae has evolved to use PLEs
to defend against the predominant predatory phage ICP1. PLEs are parasitic mobile genetic elements that
completely abolish ICP1 production while exploiting phage resources to further their own spread. Therefore,
PLEs can be viewed both as defense systems for V. cholerae, and as phage satellites that exploit ICP1 for
their own mobilization. A significant hallmark of V. cholerae PLEs is that previously prevalent PLEs disappear
globally when new variants emerge, indicating that each variant is selected by unknown factors over time.
However, we do not understand why such changes occur, and how new variants come to dominate over earlier
prevalent variants. We hypothesize that antagonism with ICP1 and other mobile genetic elements in V.
cholerae has driven the successive evolution of PLEs. We also hypothesize that reciprocal adaptations in PLE
to counter those attacks have contributed to the hallmark pattern of variant extinction and replacement. To
dissect the mechanisms of successive evolution of PLEs we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) We will
determine how ICP1 antagonism selected for PLE variants with alternative replication modules. 2) We will
define how PLE 2 mobilization renders it susceptible to ICP1 antagonism. 3) We will determine how an
interfering defense island antagonizes ICP1 and PLE activity. 4) We will investigate PLE-PLE competition and
the potential for recombination as a driver of PLE evolution. The proposed studies will provide insight into how
epidemic V. cholerae is selected for over time and will aid in tracking the dissemination of epidemic strains.
This knowledge will further enhance our understanding of phage-mediated perturbations to microbial
populations in healthy and diseased states, and advance our ability to manipulate these communities for
therapeutic or prophylactic benefit."
10833071,"Cells adapt to extrinsic and intrinsic stresses by rapidly adjusting the rates of protein synthesis. An
important mechanism for this translational control involves phosphorylation of eIF2, a translation initiator factor
that couples with GTP and delivers Met-tRNAi(Met) to ribosomes. For example during nutrient limitation, GCN2
(EIF2AK4) phosphorylation of eIF2 (eIF2-P) blocks the exchange of eIF2-GDP to eIF2-GTP, thus reducing
global translation initiation which allows cells to conserve resources and reprogram gene expression. GCN2 is
also activated by UV-B irradiation, disruption in protein degradation, and during differentiation of certain cell
types. Coincident with repression of global protein synthesis, eIF2-P enhances translation of select mRNAs,
such as ATF4, encoding a transcriptional activator of genes subject to the Integrated Stress Response (ISR).
Translational control in the ISR involves upstream open reading frames (uORFs) that serve as “bar codes” for
scanning ribosomes to delineate mRNAs that are preferentially translated from those that are repressed by or
indifferent to eIF2-P. It is important to emphasize that a majority of mammalian mRNAs contain uORFs, so
their presence alone is not sufficient to direct preferential translation. Rather we determined that the sequence
and context of uORFs are critical determinants for preferential translation in the ISR. Furthermore, while
diverse stresses induce the ISR, our research suggests that the ISR implementation of translational control
provides for different programs of gene expression that are best suited for cell adaptation to a given stress
condition. Our hypothesis is that GCN2 is activated by diverse cell perturbations, facilitating patterns of gene
expression that are tailored to adapt to a specific stress condition. In this proposal we address important gaps
in our knowledge of the ISR. Using innovative concepts and technologies that feature biochemistry, molecular
and cellular biology, and genomic and structural perspectives, we will address three fundamental ISR
questions. 1) What are the mechanisms by which GCN2 recognizes diverse stress conditions and invokes
translational control? 2) How does eIF2-P induce different patterns of mRNA translation, whereby some
mRNAs are preferentially translated, whereas others are tolerant of or repressed by eIF2-P? Finally, 3) How
does translational control invoked by eIF2-P, combined with stress-induced proteolysis, change the proteome
and signaling pathways that direct cell survival? Completion of the proposed studies will garner new insights
into the mechanisms by which diverse stresses activate GCN2 and the processes by which ribosomes
differentially translate mRNAs. These studies will also provide an understanding for how the ISR contributes to
the progression of stress-related diseases, including diabetes and related metabolic disorders,
neuropathologies, and cancer, with the promise of developing new strategies for diagnosis and treatment."
10833075,"ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
Continuous monitoring of physiological state (oxygenation, breathing, circulation) is a standard practice for all
patients receiving general anesthesia and sedation. Anesthetics produce their primary effects of
unconsciousness and antinociception by acting on molecular targets and neural circuits in the brain and central
nervous system. Nevertheless, continuous monitoring of brain function is not a practice requirement. It is no
surprise that brain dysfunction following general anesthesia is highly prevalent, particularly among the elderly.
Similarly, COVID 19 patients who can be anesthetized for weeks in the intensive care unit, are often left with
profound brain dysfunction following termination of ventilatory support. Many years of research have shown that
the level of unconsciousness of a patient receiving general anesthesia can be reliably tracked using real-time
processing of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. In recent years, dramatic advances have been made in
sensors, actuators, artificial intelligence and control theory algorithms. A highly plausible solution is the
development of closed loop anesthesia delivery (CLAD) systems that determine in real time from the EEG the
patient’s level of unconsciousness and precisely control an anesthetic infusion to maintain the level at an
appropriate target. The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) readily acknowledges the significant enhancement
to patient care that CLAD systems can provide. To date, no system has been approved for human use due to a
lack of appropriate animal models to test adequately the reliability and robustness of these systems. Therefore
the research design of this project will be to conduct in non-human primates neurophysiological recordings (EEG,
local field potentials and neural spiking activity) while simultaneously administering anesthetics using a
computer-controlled syringe pump as the animals execute a behavior task to characterize level of
unconsciousness. The data will be analyzed by combining pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic modeling,
modern control theory and statistical signal processing approaches to develop and test real-time CLAD systems.
The specific aims of this research project are to develop and test in a non-human primate model, CLAD systems
for real-time control of unconsciousness using the anesthetics: propofol, dexmedetomidine, and propofol and
dexmedetomidine administered simultaneously. The broad long-term objectives are to: establish a non-human
primate model paradigm for development and testing of CLAD systems; and make the use of CLAD systems a
standard for intelligent brain state monitoring and precise second-to-second drug dosing in anesthesiology. The
health relatedness impact of the research will be a new paradigm for computer-assisted vigilance of brain state
and computer-assisted dosing of anesthetic agents. Such systems should enhance patient safety by reducing
provider errors and by fostering significant decreases in anesthesia-associate brain dysfunction as well as other
anesthesia-related morbidities (inadequate pain control, hypotension, nausea) commonly experienced by the
millions of patients who each year receive anesthesia care in operating rooms and intensive care units."
10833076,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The coevolution of hosts and parasites is mediated by genetic mutations that allow one side to gain an advantage over the
other. As the host immune system bears the primary burden of responding to evolving parasites, it is expected to adapt or
diversify in response to natural selection. However, recent population genetics analyses from a variety of animal taxa only
partially bear out this hypothesis, revealing a paucity of adaptive evolution among innate immune gene repertoires relative
to expectations. My recent work suggests that an appreciable proportion of genes associated with innate immune
responses in taxa as broad as humans, insects and plants are pleiotropic, meaning that they also play unrelated roles in
other organismal traits like development and the response to abiotic stress. This observation raises the possibility of
temporal and evolutionary tension between the use of a gene product for developmental and immunological functions.
Current coevolutionary theory largely fails to account for sources of genetic constraint on host defenses, impeding the
translation of existing coevolutionary models into predictions for evolutionary dynamics at the molecular or system level.
Moving forward, a major focus of research in my lab will be to explore the role of pleiotropic genetic architecture on the
evolvability of host immune systems in response to parasite pressure.
To tackle this long-term objective, my lab will employ several complementary approaches. Using transcriptome data, we
will define the extent and dynamics of pleiotropy among developmental, stress, and immunological pathway genes in a
variety of insect model species. We will perform genome-wide evolutionary genetics analyses in these insect species to
quantify signatures of selection on pleiotropic and non-pleiotropic developmental, immunological, and stress response
gene sets relative to null expectations. We will build mathematical models of immune pathway protein networks
possessing different properties – modularity, redundancy, complexity, pleiotropy – and allow them to co-evolve with
parasites, quantifying changes in fitness landscapes to better understand network structures that constrain or promote host
adaptation. In parallel, we will run coevolution experiments using the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum and its natural
parasites. We will manipulate the strength of pleiotropic antagonism among immunity and other processes in these
experiments by limiting host-microbe interactions to a particular developmental stage or altering abiotic stress conditions,
and then compare the evolutionary trajectories and genetic bases of host-microbe interaction outcomes.
Together, these research avenues will provide insight into an array of fundamental questions about the extent of genetic
pleiotropy among essential physiological processes, the influence of pleiotropy on coevolutionary dynamics, and the role
of immune system architecture in host adaptation to parasite pressure. Gaining greater insight into the evolutionary forces
that shape biological systems has important implications for predicting human pathogen evolution, understanding the
origins of diseases like autoimmunity and sepsis, and designing therapeutic treatments that minimize side effects."

Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia, is characterized by cognitive decline and impairment
of behavioral and functional abilities. Approximate 5.8 million people in the United States are affected by
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and this number is anticipated to triple by 2050. While mutations in amyloid
precursor protein (APP) and presenillin (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are known to cause familial early onset AD and
the APOE4 variant is a well-known disease risk factor, the genetic contributions to the majority of late onset
AD cases are not clear. Additionally, while the accumulation of Aβ plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau are
considered to be hallmark features of AD cases, Aβ plaques and tau tangles do not fully explain the clinical
features and heterogeneity found in AD patients. The identification of the C9orf72 GGGGCC hexanucleotide
repeat expansion as the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal
dementia raises an intriguing question whether unidentified repeat expansion mutations contribute to other
form of dementia including AD. Additionally, similarities in disease pathology are observed between AD and
patients with repeat expansion disorders. These similarities include the accumulation of abnormal proteins,
neuronal loss in affected brain regions, and the involvement of stress in worsening disease. While repetitive
elements account for a large portion of the human genome, the detection repeat-expansion mutations,
especially GC-rich repeat expansions, is challenging. To overcome the difficulties in identifying repeat
expansion mutations, I have developed a novel dCas9-based repeat pull-down method (dCas9READ) that
allows the isolation of repeat expansion mutations directly from the genomic DNA of individual patients. The
objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that novel repeat expansion mutations contribute to late
onset AD and their repeat containing RNA and RAN products are toxic and contribute to AD pathology. I am
excited to report that in an initial screen, 17.5% of human AD autopsy cases tested were positive for RAN
protein aggregates and RNA foci. In this grant, I will follow-up on these exciting preliminary data and test this
hypothesis that novel repeat expansion mutations contribute to AD in the following specific aims: Aim 1) Will
develop a novel dCas9-based technique for rapidly identifying repeat expansions. Aim 2) Will test the
hypothesis that novel repeat expansions mutations are present at higher frequencies in late onset AD vs.
control samples. Aim 3) Will test the hypothesis that novel repeat expansion mutations are toxic and contribute
to AD pathology."

 We propose a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study to test an adapted evidence-based
intervention and explore critical implementation issues, including feasibility, acceptability, and costs, that
influence scale-up and sustainment. We focus this adaptation, effectiveness, and implementation study on
underserved rural residents, a population that maintains extremely high rates of suboptimal diet and sedentary
behaviors, placing them at elevated risk for cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, cancer, and other
chronic conditions. Within the vulnerable low socioeconomic status population of rural residents, Appalachian
Kentuckians experience even worse health outcomes, including among the highest rates of morbidity and
mortality in the nation. Such adversity is exacerbated by and associated with inadequate community resources.
Increasingly, however, Appalachian residents and other vulnerable populations are gaining access to
modalities that may be useful in addressing these health challenges, including internet connectivity and nearly
ubiquitous cell phone use. Despite this accelerating technology use, the evidence base on personal
technology-associated interventions (mHealth) in a rural, high need population remains sparse. We propose
finalizing adaptation and testing an evidence-based multicomponent mHealth intervention, Make Better
Choices 2 (MBC2), a behavioral program consisting of personalized health coaching, an app, accelerometer,
and financial incentives. In a recent randomized controlled trial among urban adults, MBC2 produced large,
sustained diet and physical activity improvements by leveraging effective behavior change techniques,
including goal-setting, self-monitoring, accountability, and support. To prepare for the implementation of this
successful intervention with a new population marked by extreme health inequities and sparse resources, our
team has engaged in extensive foundational efforts based on the Dynamic Adaptation Process framework.
These include: (1) completing focus groups and key informant interviews to assess the feasibility and
acceptability for rural Appalachian residents to use the MBC2 program; (2) undertaking a comprehensive
community inventory to reveal existing and needed resources; (3) engaging stakeholders in community and
academic team meetings, including community forums and CAB meetings; and (4) identifying MBC2
programmatic and structural elements in need of adaptation. With this extensive preliminary activity, we now
propose a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial in which we: (1) finalize adaptation by wireframe and
usability testing MBC2 with local Appalachian residents; (2) conduct a RCT to test the effectiveness of the
adapted MBC2 compared to an active control arm; and (3) explore implementation outcomes and contextual
factors, with a focus on sustainment. This project aspires to demonstrate that systematic adaptation and
implementation of an evidence-based intervention can lead to meaningful and sustained behavioral changes,
and to prepare for potential scale-up and sustainment of the intervention to maximize its public health impact."
10833472,"The Paramyxoviridae family is comprised of globally prevalent human pathogens such as measles, mumps, human parainfluenza, and the deadly henipaviruses Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV). NiV has a mortality rate in humans of ~75%, is a BSL-4 Category C priority pathogen in the NIAID Research Agenda and is listed by the WHO as likely to cause future pandemics, requiring “urgent action.” NiV and HeV represent a rapidly growing genus with ~20 recently discovered henipaviruses; thus, it is possible that additional henipaviruses will emerge in the human population. For NiV animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission and the lack of approved vaccines or therapeutics, underscore the need for research and treatment development. The process of cell entry is key to infection of all viruses and provides targets for antiviral treatments. In our first funding period, we made significant progress in establishing novel concepts and tools to dissect the steps of the membrane fusion process. Thus, we are poised to build and expand upon this progress to mechanistically understand the membrane fusion process for the deadliest henipaviruses, with broader impact for the paramyxoviruses. Paramyxoviral entry into cells (viral-cell fusion) and the pathologic syncytia formation (cell-cell fusion) associated with infections, require membrane fusion, a process coordinated by two viral proteins: the attachment (HN, H, or G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins. How G/F interactions link cell receptor binding to F-triggering and later steps in the membrane fusion cascade remain critical knowledge gaps for the paramyxoviruses, including NiV and HeV. In our proposed studies, we will address these knowledge gaps and test the hypothesis that newly-discovered fusion-modulatory domains in NiV G and F modulate distinct specific early and late intermediates of the membrane fusion cascade. To test this hypothesis, we identified many useful G and F mutants, including mutants capable of receptor-binding but incapable of F-triggering, or capable of F-triggering but trapping the fusion cascade at post-F-triggering steps. These are exciting and highly-useful paramyxoviral phenotypes for teasing out the steps of the membrane fusion cascade. Further, our recent technical advances include: assays to measure the distinct early and late intermediates of membrane fusion, and tools to detect G and F conformational changes and interactions on viral particles in situ by flow virometry. Thus, for the first time, we have gathered the conceptual and technical advances needed to discern the individual membrane fusion intermediates and reveal mechanisms that govern henipaviral membrane fusion. We will use these tools to: Aim 1. Determine how the NiV-G head and stalk domains modulate receptor-induced membrane fusion; Aim 2. Determine how NiV-F modulates F-triggering and late membrane fusion steps; and Aim 3. Determine how G/F interactions modulate membrane fusion and viral entry. Completion of our Aims will create a comprehensive mechanistic model for the henipaviral membrane fusion process leading to infection, with likely broader impact for the paramyxoviruses."

 Sickle cell disease (SCD) and ?-thalassemia are genetic disorders affecting the structure or production
of hemoglobin. They are growing global health burden afflicting millions around the world. Sufficient fetal
hemoglobin (HbF) induction can reduce morbidity and mortality in SCD. The same is true for β-thalassemia. The
standard current therapy for HbF induction in SCD hydroxyurea (HU) which in adults, does not usually ameliorate
sufficiently either sickle vaso-occlusion or hemolysis. Therefore, the search for more effective and safer small
molecule HbF inducers is a key unmet need in the management of SCD. We recently discovered that the
peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1α) is involved in the regulation of the
globin genes. Upregulation of PGC-1α by lentivirus infection or by a small molecule compound ZLN005 in human
primary erythroid progenitor CD34+ cells induced HbF expression and increased the percent of F-cells without
affecting cell proliferation and differentiation. Activation of PGC-1α by ZLN005 might provide a new path into
hemoglobin regulation with a promising therapeutic benefit in SCD. We intend to test for in vivo therapeutic
effects of ZLN005 in sickle cell mice. The findings from these preclinical studies could provide initial proof of
principle for developing safer, more beneficial small molecule therapeutics for SCD treatment and lead to early-
phase clinical trials."
10837860,"The Annual National MD/PhD Student Conference was established in 1986 by the University of Colorado
Medical Scientist Training Program (CU MSTP) and for the past 34 years has occurred in mid-July in a
Colorado mountain resort. We obtained R13 funding in 2000 and this is the 4th competitive renewal application.
The objective of the unique conference specifically targeting MD/PhD trainees is to provide a forum that brings
together a diverse group of ~190 dual-degree students from across the nation to learn about cutting-edge
biomedical research from Keynote speakers and MD/PhD trainees; to promote networking and life-long
friendships with peers that are going through similar issues as they train; and to promote the progression of
their career as high impact physician-scientists. The current 3rd year CU MSTPs organize the conference,
guided by an annually rotating Faculty Advisor. The 2.5-day conference is multi-disciplinary addressing the
most important current biomedical problems and includes talks by 5 nationally renowned Keynote speakers,
both established (Nobel Laureates, NAS members & HHMI Investigators) and rising stars; 18 oral student
presentations; 100 student posters; 5 Break Out Sessions; a Career Panel; and a Research Track Residency
Recruitment Fair. Break Out Sessions include topics such as: Women in Science, Research Ethics, Rigor &
Reproducibility, Career Opportunities at NIH, Interfacing with Industry, and Clinical Trials. A recent addition has
been the Research Track Residency Recruitment Fair, whereby Directors of these program come and recruit
MD/PhD students by establishing Program-specific tables during food service, serving on career panels,
attending talks and posters, and setting up recruitment booths. The average annual Conference attendance is
~186, with ~108 (58%) men, ~78 (42%) women, and ~15 (8%) URM. Diversity is strongly endorsed with 8
(27%) women and 2 (7%) URM of the 30 Keynote Speakers, and 10 (36%) women and 0 (0%) URM of the 28
Break Out Session Leaders. The R13 grant pays for 10 Diversity Travel Awards of $1000 each, which we
competitively select every year from the URM applicant pool. In the 5-year period (2014-2018) since the last
submission, 49 Diversity Travel Awards were presented to 30 men and 19 women, representing 40 institutions.
Publicity for the conference is accomplished via: emails to the AAMC MD/PhD Directors and Administrators
list-serve; our CU MSTP Conference Website; Conference Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages; and listing
the conference on the American Physician Scientist Association website with a hotlink. Finally, a key “added
value” of the Conference is that the “MD/PhD Program Organization” and “MD/PhD Section of the AAMC
GREAT Group” grew directly out of the student Conference. In sum, the continuous improvement of this unique
conference, the consistent elite caliber of the Keynote speakers, the emphasis on providing opportunities for
career promotion as physician-scientists, and the new Research Track Residency Recruitment Fair and
involvement of these Directors in the conference justifies our request for continued R13 support."

10848851,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall objective of this training program is to identify, motivate, and train the next
generation of neuroscientists and neuroengineers in Computational Approaches to the
Neuroscience of Audition and Communication (CANAC). This objective maps elegantly onto the
2023-2027 NIDCD Strategic Plan and its Theme Areas. In particular, this training program acts
at the interface between (a) Theme 1's Goals #1 and #2, which identify and characterize different
cell populations in both peripheral and central regions and the neural circuits involved in sensory
processing and (b) Theme 2's Goal #3 to develop in silico (computer) models to enable insights
into normal and disordered function. These Theme Areas require not only rigorous experimental
manipulations but also sophisticated computational theory to understand the generated data and
to make testable predictions for future science. As such, we propose to continue our T32 training
program in order to train the next generation of scientists, who are grounded in the experimental
neuroscience of auditory and communication systems and versed in theory and computation. A
unique aspect of our training proposal is its integrative philosophy, which leverages a highly
collaborative and cross-disciplinary approach to auditory and communication science fostered
by faculty on the Penn campus: predoctoral students will master techniques from diverse
traditional fields to become independent investigators vested with skills in both experimental
and computational neuroscience. Our program curriculum includes core and elective courses
designed to achieve this breadth of knowledge. Fundamental to the goals of our program, all
trainees receive cross-disciplinary training: each trainee will be formally co-mentored by two
faculty members, one whose expertise is computational and another whose expertise is in the
experimental neuroscience of auditory and communication systems. We have devised a
sophisticated evaluation team to keep track of progress and outcomes, and plan a comprehensive
training program, including coursework, a reading group, journal clubs, seminar series, and an
annual retreat. We will continue our efforts to enhance our applicant diversity via targeted
recruitment, broad advertising, and dissemination of program outputs. Accepted trainees will
receive two years of funding. We will instruct all trainees in the responsible conduct of research.
Together, these activities comprise an integrative, cross-disciplinary training program that will
develop a talented and diverse pool of trainees to become long-term leaders in the field of auditory
and communication neuroscience."
10848888,"Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) is a complex disorder that contains multiple cell
populations, making it is difficult to study the nature and cellular function and delineate relationship among
subpopulations. The analysis of global gene expressions in single cell level has evolved at an astounding pace
in the past few years, and now reaching a sophisticated level to solve heterogeneity in complex organs. To
understanding the in vivo tumor microenvironment, a large scale (~10,000 cells) single cell gene expression
assay can elucidate transitional states and delineate relationships among subpopulations. The goals of this
proposal are to characterize a distinct population of HNSCC stromal progenitors, to explore cellular
mechanisms by which these cells regulate tumor progression, and to ultimately translate the findings into
clinical cancer therapies. Using genetic tools and SCC animal models, data has been generated to
demonstrate that: 1) a unique postnatal Gli1+ stromal population is found in the craniofacial region, 2) Gli1+
cells behave as progenitors under homeostatic and disease conditions in vivo, 3) tumor progression is
supported by stromal components that are elevated in HNSCC microenvironment and serve as a chemo-
attractant for tumor invasion, and 4) 3D culture of primary tumor keratinocytes with cancer associated
fibroblasts (CAFs) showed that the stratified growth, cell proliferation, and differentiation are comparable
between co-cultures and their respective native tissues, while they largely differed in cultures without CAFs.
We hypothesize that Gli1+ cells contain a distinct subpopulation of stromal progenitors in the
craniofacial region, and that Gli1+ cells play a niche role in supporting HNSCC progression through
remodeling epithelial morphogenesis. During this proposal, we will explore whether Gli1+ cells as a niche
support cancer progression and metastasis through lineage tracing in Gli1CreERT2;TdTomato mice and
diphtheria-mediated loss-of-function in Gli1CreERT2;DTA mice (Aim 1). Subsequently, this proposal will use
transcriptomic and spatial molecular analysis in single-cell level combined with computational analysis and
functional validation to identify unique in vivo stromal populations in mouse and human HNSCC and elucidate
their molecular and pathway signatures. We will validate these unique cancer stromal subpopulations and
investigate their features, regulatory mechanism, function, and spatial and molecular characteristics. Based on
the findings, by 3D organoid modeling with novel vascularized organ-on-a chip technique, newly identified
tumor specific stromal progenitor populations will be utilized to generate 3D vascularized SCC organoids and
discover novel therapeutic avenues for HNSCC management (Aim 2). Successful completion of the proposal
will advance our understanding of the nature of in vivo stromal effects in tumor microenvironment and will
develop new treatments for HNSCC."

10852943,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Community Engagement Core
New Mexico communities have historically borne an unequal burden of exposure to environmental
toxicants in the air, water and soil. Local communities experience high rates of poverty, limited access
to healthcare and generational trauma that intensify the impact of these environmental exposures.
Native American communities have led the way in sharing and addressing environmental health
concerns in partnerships with UNM researchers, based on culturally relevant, multi-directional
communication that advances environmental health science (EHS) responsiveness to the most urgent
health needs of local communities. The aims of the New Mexico Integrative Science Program
Incorporating Research in Environmental Sciences (NM-INSPIRES) Community Engagement Core
(CEC) are to 1) translate research and enhance environmental communication and environmental
health literacy using culturally-centered processes; 2) increase community-responsive environmental
health research through multi- directional communication with community stakeholders; and 3) enroll
community stakeholders and researchers in communication and cultural training to build capacity and
enhance community-academic partnerships. We will co-create and implement communication
dissemination plans for multi-modal outreach strategies, including print, digital, and social media
materials in plain language, visual arts for STEM-related environmental health messaging, community
events, and media advocacy to bridge the communication gap and ensure a well targeted, multi-
directional impactful flow of information meaningful to New Mexico communities. We will ensure NM-
INSPIRES’ responsiveness and relevance to community priorities through multi-directional interactions
among researchers and community stakeholders. We will communicate community concerns to
researchers and facilitate community-engaged research. We will increase enrollment of community
stakeholders and researchers in communication and cultural training to build capacity and enhance
community-academic EH partnerships. We will design, adapt, integrate and evaluate evidence-based
cultural and communication workshops for community and academic partners, policymakers, journalists
and clinicians to build a common framework of understanding and foster the strong relationships
needed for true multi-directional communications. NM-INSPIRES is uniquely positioned to lead EH
community engagement by drawing on our long-standing, culturally sensitive partnerships that are
respectful of the cultural diversity and historical trauma of local residents by integrating core values,
beliefs and practices into research programs. Our long-term goal is to secure an effective, ongoing
community-academic partnership that engages our diverse NM communities in environmental health
exposure research and translation, including environmental health literacy and risk prevention."
10852855,"SUMMARY
The viral reservoir in latently infected CD4+ T lymphocytes represents the key challenge for achieving an HIV-1
cure. We recently reported that the combination of the broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) PGT121 together
with a TLR7 agonist resulted in a substantial delay or prevention of viral rebound following ART discontinuation
in SHIV-infected rhesus monkeys. However, the biology and heterogeneity of the viral reservoir, as well as the
mechanism(s) by which these immunotherapeutic strategies target the reservoir, remain to be determined.
We hypothesize that there is substantial heterogeneity in the anatomic locations, cellular phenotypes,
host transcriptomes, and viral sequences of the viral reservoir, and that certain subsets of reservoir cells
are more susceptible to immune-mediated destruction. An improved understanding of the different cellular
subsets that comprise the viral reservoir will be essential for understanding the partial efficacy of current
interventions and for developing improved next-generation HIV-1 cure strategies. In this proposal, we will
continue an ongoing collaboration between Alex K. Shalek at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), who
is an expert in single-cell genomic profiling approaches, and Dan H. Barouch at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
School (BIDMC), who is an expert in conducting HIV-1 cure studies in rhesus monkeys and humans. This unique
and synergistic partnership will apply the most insightful, cutting-edge, single-cell `-omics' assays to the most
relevant blood and tissue specimens from both monkeys and humans, leading to a deeper understanding of the
viral reservoir.
Overall, we will utilize these cutting-edge, single-cell `-omics' technologies to define, at multiple levels,
the functional heterogeneity of the viral reservoir and to evaluate the mechanism by which current
immunotherapeutic interventions target subsets of replication-competent reservoir cells. Such

destruction by comparing reservoir identity and phenotype following distinct immunotherapy protocols, and to
refine and develop next generation HIV-1 cures. To accomplish this goal, we propose the following two Specific
Aims:
Aim 1: To evaluate the anatomic, cellular, molecular, and viral heterogeneity of the viral reservoir in ART-
suppressed rhesus monkeys using single-cell and population genomic profiling strategies
Aim 2: To determine the extent to which current immunotherapeutic interventions target various

Sexual well-being (SW), the cognitive and emotional evaluation of an individual's sexuality, is an important
aspect of overall health and quality of life, yet it is often overlooked in research and clinical practice. Issues
around sexuality may have wide-ranging repercussions, from mental health problems to damaged
interpersonal relationships, psychological distress, risky behaviors, to violence. Despite this, we still know little
about which factors determine SW, and how to measure it. Existing self-report scales are either designed to be
brief, only suitable for certain groups, and/or focus mostly on sexual functioning and the absence of negative
factors such as coercion or sexually-transmitted infections. While this is important, it is not sufficient for optimal
sexual health, which is “a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being related to sexuality;[...]not
merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity” (WHO, 2006). Optimal SW may also encompass
positive factors, such as feeling loved by one's partner, the ability to enjoy pleasurable experiences, and self-
acceptance. Challenges in measuring SW hinders the research process, making informed decisions on
sexuality education, and the development of impactful interventions. Here we address these gaps by
developing a comprehensive model and in-depth scale of SW which includes positive, strength-based aspects
of sexuality. Our team includes experts in sexuality, public health, psychology, and measurement scale
development. We will use a proven, highly rigorous three-phase methodology over a five year project timeline.
In phase one, we will identify all potential dimensions of SW by applying surveys, analyzing focus groups,
conducting interviews, literature review, and more. Phase two focuses on validation of the identified
dimensions and development of a robust SW measurement scale. We will first generate a pool of
questionnaire items that cover all candidate dimensions and then use interviews, expert feedback, and pilot
studies to refine them. Subsequently, we will conduct large-scale studies with thousands of participants to
establish the scale's dimensionality using factor analysis, and will test scale validity across different subgroups
of our samples. In the final phase, we will assess the value of the resulting SW scale for research and public
health by administering it to 3000 participants in a U.S. nationally representative probability sample. We will
examine how SW dimensions vary with age, gender, and other demographic variables, as well as associations
with health and well-being. Participants will also rate the importance of each dimension, as individuals differ
vastly in what they care about in sexuality. We will test whether incorporating importance ratings into scale item
weights improve its ability to predict health outcomes. Ultimately, our research will deliver a robust SW scale
with demonstrable value for predicting health outcomes, thereby laying a robust foundation for future
investigations, clinical applications, and interventions."

During the last 10 years of both CPTAC2 and CPTAC3, the JHU Proteome Characterization Center (JHU/PCC)
has repeatedly demonstrated superior technological innovation and robust data generation that have played
critical roles in the success of CPTAC's core mission of accelerating the understanding of the molecular basis of
cancer through the application of large-scale proteome and genome analysis technologies to different cancer
types. As one of the 3 current CPTAC3 PCCs, we established robust and standardized proteomic analysis
protocols and technologies and applied them to 7 human cancer cohorts and an additional 200 patient-derived
xenografts from the Patient-Derived Models Repository. Together with the Proteogenomic Data Analysis Centers
(PGDACs), we published articles on integrated proteogenomic studies in four cancer types. For our CPTAC4
PCC application, the overarching goal of our PCC is to generate accurate and reproducible data using
sensitive, quantitative, and standardized technologies. We will leverage our established Center's
infrastructure and capitalize on our success in clinical cancer proteogenomic discoveries to characterize
proteins, protein modifications, and protein complexes associated with genomic alterations of cancer
from additional human tumor types and pre-clinical models. We will identify unique features that are inherent
to proteins such as post-translational modifications covering acetylation and ubiquitination, as well as protein-
protein interactions in addition to glycosylation and phosphorylation that have been included in our current PCC.
We propose a three-step strategy to characterize defined sets of genomics-characterized samples using
technology platforms validated during CPTAC3: (1) Discovery of target proteins from both clinical specimens
and preclinical models using quantitative proteomics by tandem mass tags and data dependent acquisition mass
spectrometry; (2) Verification of findings using orthogonal data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry; and
(3) Confirmation of the verified targets using high-throughput, CPTAC Tier 2 analytically-validated targeted
Multiple Reaction Monitoring Mass Spectrometry (MRM-MS) assays. We further propose pilot studies for
technology improvement. While this PCC application is focused on the proteomic characterization of clinical
specimens and preclinical models, we believe that the understanding of and the expertise in proteogenomic data
analysis and translation will be critical for the success of the PCC and the overall CPTAC network. We have
assembled a team of outstanding investigators with complementary expertise and years of experience in the
CPTAC program (CPTAC2 and CPTAC3), and evidence of successful collaborations with investigators/PIs from
the CPTAC PGDACs and Proteogenomic Translational Research Centers (PTRCs). We believe that our PCC
offers the best opportunity for the successful characterization of biological and clinical specimens to discover
and confirm cancer targets to advance precision cancer medicine."

The United States needs a strong, diverse workforce of Ph.D.-level scientists and engineers to meet emerging
challenges to the nation’s health and to cultivate faculty and leaders who represent our heterogeneous national
population. It is well known that when people from different backgrounds and experiences come together, their
combined perspectives and creativity lead to new approaches to challenging problems. The purpose of the
proposed MARC Program at the University of Texas at San Antonio is to recruit and train a diverse group of
undergraduates who are from ethnic minority groups, are financially disadvantaged, or have a disability– all
groups that currently play a minimal role in our national biomedical workforce. Our goal is that MARC training
will allow them to undertake the highest levels of research training, leading to the award of the Doctorate in
Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. Holding this degree opens the door to positions of great impact and responsibility in
the biomedical research industry, government institutions, and our nation’s universities. The MARC trainees will
be majors in Biology, Biomedical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Physics, Psychology, and
Mathematics. To prepare future trainees, MARC will develop a ‘pre-MARC” population of excellent applicants
and educate them about the Ph.D. careers in research, fundamental professional skills, help them connect with
faculty, and guide them towards research experiences and the MARC program. MARC will provide financial
support to trainees who enter as sophomores or juniors and complete the program as seniors, acquiring between
two and three years of experience. MARC will offer a wide array of training workshops and experiences for the
trainees and for additional “MARC-2” students who desire a Ph.D. but are not in one of the 24 MARC training
positions. MARC training for students and their faculty research mentors will ensure that the trainees have a safe
and welcoming laboratory experience; grow a network of peers, faculty, and former MARC trainees; develop the
many research and professional skills needed to be strong applicants for PhD programs; learn modern
computational techniques for working with data; and grow as leaders. Training workshops will guide the trainees
through important events in their development, among them writing an abstract (summary) of their research so
that they can present it at a scientific conference, making presentations in increasingly professional settings,
completing their first application to another school to obtain a summer research position, and finally, successfully
applying to, and interviewing for, Ph.D. programs. The MARC faculty, staff, mentors, and instructors have
supported hundreds of underrepresented students in programs for over 20 years; scores of these students have
been admitted to some of the most prestigious Ph.D. programs in the world. For this proposed five-year program,
our main goals are for all trainees to graduate with their bachelor’s degree, with at least 80% of trainees
continuing on the doctoral path, and 85% of these completing their programs and advancing to high-level careers
in the biomedical sciences that will benefit all Americans."
10853032,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Our application focus on DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), a DNA repair factor with newly
identified role in RNA metabolism and a target of cancer therapy, and will use genetic, cell biology and single
molecule approaches to dissect the role of DNA-PK during lymphoma and leukemia-genesis and therapy.
Genomic instability is the hallmark of human cancer. The Non-Homologous End-Joining (NHEJ) is a major DNA
double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair pathway and is required for physiological gene-rearrangements and
oncogenic chromosomal translocations in developing lymphocytes. DNA-PK, composed of KU70-KU80
heterodimer (KU) and the large catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), is a NHEJ factor critical for both end-processing
(e.g., hairpin opening) and end-ligation during NHEJ. DNA-PKcs inhibitors is in phase I/IIa clinical trials for cancer
therapy. During NHEJ, KU binds to DNA ends, recruits and activates DNA-PKcs. Loss of DNA-PKcs abrogate
Artemis endonuclease mediated end-processing without abolishing end-ligation. We showed that expression of
kinase-dead (KD) (DNA-PKcsKD/KD) abrogates end-ligation without affecting end-processing, uncovering an end-
protection role of DNA-PKcs that is regulated by its own kinase activity. End-processing in DNA-PKcsKD/KD mice
is blocked by ATM inhibition, indicating end-processing requires DNA-PKcs protein, and the kinase activity from
either DNA-PKcs or the related ATM kinase in vivo. DNA-PKcs is the best characterized substrate of DNA-PK
and can also be phosphorylated by ATM. Mice carrying phosphorylation-deficient (DNA-PKcs5A/5A) DNA-PKcs
display mild end-ligation defects and are sensitive to ATM inhibition. Thus, we propose that once assembled on
KU-bound DNA, DNA-PK phosphorylation regulates end-processing and eventually the release of DNA-PKcs to
licence end-ligation. Moreover, we found that Ku can also direct the assembly of DNA-PKcs on structured RNA
(e.g., rRNA and snoRNA), where phosphorylation defective (DNA-PK5A) or KD DNA-PKcs (DNA-PKcsKD/KD)
blocks rRNA processing, protein translation, and erythropoiesis, leading to Trp53-dependent bone marrow failure.
These findings uncovered a NHEJ-independent role of DNA-PK in mammals. And two-third of DNA-
PKcsKD/KDTrp53-/- mice succumbed to ribosomal stress induced myeloid leukemia and one-third died of
lymphomas with IgH-Myc translocations, highlighting the critical role of DNA-PK in tumor suppression. Based on
these and other findings, we hypothesize that DNA-PKcs kinase activity and auto-phosphorylation regulates
KU-dependent assembly of DNA-PK on DNA and RNA to suppress lymphoma and leukemia genesis. To
test this, we will 1) characterize and compare KU and DNA-PK dynamics on RNA vs DNA; 2) elucidate how KU-
depletion impact RNA processing in human cells; 3) determine the physiological function of KU80 C-terminal
domain and tail in lymphoma and leukemia genesis and the recruitment and stabilization of DNA-PKcs. The
results will reveal the regulation and function of the RNA & DNA dependent function of DNA-PK, the essential
role of KU in human cells, and the broad impacts of DNA-PK inhibition."

10852235,"ABSTRACT. Preservation of muscle function through Schwann cell regulation of motor unit expansion
The loss of skeletal muscle mass and function with aging, known as sarcopenia, is a universal health challenge
for the growing elderly population, contributing to decreased mobility, increased disability, loss of independence,
and poor quality of life. Studies from our group and others have shown that disruptions of muscle fiber innervation
and a reduction in the number of motor units (MU) are significant factors in sarcopenia. A major compensatory
mechanism that preserves muscle under conditions of denervation, is MU expansion, which requires axon
sprouting and guidance from innervated to denervated neuromuscular junctions (NMJ). In this proposal we will
for the first time define cellular responses and molecular pathways critical for MU expansion with the goal
of facilitating the development of effective preventive and rehabilitative interventions that exploit this existing
protective process. It is widely accepted that axon growth between NMJs occurs through bridges formed by
proliferating terminal Schwann cells (tSCs). Exciting new data from our lab using experimental as well as
bioinformatic approaches point to the induction during MU remodeling of the secreted phosphoprotein 1 (Spp1)-
CD44-protein kinase C alpha pathway from myelinating Schwann cells (SC) onto tSCs. This signaling pathway
has not previously been studied in sarcopenia, but published reports show increased Spp1 levels in nerves
following denervation injury, the ability of Spp1 to induced SC proliferation through interactions with its receptor
CD44, and CD44 expression on tSCs that is increased with nerve injury and during ongoing denervation/
reinnervation in an animal model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Collectively, rigorous preliminary and
published data strongly support SCs as critical effectors of MU expansion via signaling by Spp1. The goals of
this project are to establish the effects of age on this pathway in SCs, define the links between denervation and
Spp1 signaling, and determine whether this pathway can be targeted to develop protective and rehabilitative
therapies for muscle loss. Our overall hypothesis is that MU expansion requires a specific population of tSCs
that proliferate in response to denervation through Spp1 signaling mediated by CD44. Using a
combination of powerful mouse models, technically sophisticated surgical interventions and assessments of MU
properties, and rigorous multidisciplinary genomic and analytical approaches we will show (i) how the number
and function of various populations of SCs change with aging and loss of innervation, (ii) the patterns of
expression of Spp1 and its signaling partners during denervation and reinnervation, and (iii) the impact of altered
Spp1 signaling on MU expansion. By exploiting this physiological compensatory protective mechanism as a
therapeutic target, rehabilitative interventions may be developed to preserve muscle, prolong healthspan, and
improve quality of life during aging as well in the context of injury or degenerative neuromuscular and mobility
disorders, such as ALS. Successful completion of these aims will accelerate both advances in mechanistic
understanding of MU expansion and the ability to target those mechanisms for musculoskeletal rehabilitation."

This proposal is for the purchase of a 4-laser Amnis ImageStream MK II imaging flow cytometer for placement
in the UMass Chan Medical School (UMCMS) Flow Cytometry Research Core Facility, a robust and well-
established facility serving over 120 principal investigators each year. The Flow Core currently utilizes a 3-laser
Amnis FlowSight imaging flow cytometer that is 11 years old and, with only 20 X magnification, lacks the
resolution to meet the imaging needs of our researchers. Many of the Major and Minor users supporting this
proposal currently rely on cumbersome microscopy techniques because they could not obtain sufficient
resolution on our FlowSight to utilize imaging flow cytometry for applications such as cell-cell interactions,
subcellular localization, DNA repair foci, phagocytosis, and complex morphological changes like NETosis. The
4-laser Amnis ImageStream with 20/40/60 X magnification will have greatly improved capabilities, increased
sensitivity, resolution, and reproducibility of single-cell imaging. Coupled with the new Machine Learning
software, the ImageStream will greatly increase our researchers’ rate of data acquisition as well as speed of
data analysis, while offering verifiable, objective, reproducible data, and statistical analyses.
The UMCMS Flow Core has been faced with the urgent need to replace a large amount of aging but essential
equipment within a short time, as many of our instruments have been made obsolete by the manufacturer.
Recognizing that institutional funds are limiting, this proposal for a Shared Instrumentation Grant is an
essential part of our equipment replacement plan. Our researchers that depend on the Flow Core instruments
come from over 20 different departments and over 90% of them are NIH-funded. These investigators have
helped to make UMMS a world-leader in translational research, coupling basic biomedical research to a bench-
to-bedside innovation engine. UMMS researchers have made pivotal advances in HIV, cancer, diabetes,
autoimmunity, infectious disease, gene therapy and in understanding the molecular basis of disease. The Flow
Core has been central to many of these advances. This Amnis ImageStream MK II imaging flow cytometer will
support new research applications that could not be imaged on our FlowSight, providing state-of-the-art cell
analyses for our dynamic, growing pool of NIH-funded researchers. The research projects of our 12 Major and
7 Minor users cover diverse areas of medical research including cancer, autoimmunity, bacterial and fungal
pathogens, anemia, malaria, HIV, COVID-19 and more."
10854941,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Postdiagnosis physical activity is associated with a lower risk of cancer recurrence and death in colon cancer
survivors. However, the biological mechanisms that underpin the effects of physical activity on cancer
recurrence and death are poorly understood. Skeletal muscle is the most abundant tissue in the human body,
representing 40% of body weight and 30% of basal energy expenditure. Skeletal muscle fat infiltration, known
as myosteatosis, is an ectopic triglyceride depot that causes insulin resistance and inflammation. One in three
colon cancer survivors has myosteatosis. Myosteatosis increases the risk of cancer recurrence, cardiovascular
disease, and death in colon cancer survivors. Among older adults, myosteatosis predicts poor muscle strength
and subsequent disability, which is relevant because 62% of colon cancer survivors have functional limitations,
and these limitations erode quality of life and compromise longevity. We hypothesize that structured exercise
training remodels skeletal muscle composition (Aim 1), corrects muscle metabolic inflexibility (Aim 2), and
increases muscle function (Aim 3) in a manner consistent with an improved cancer prognosis and reduced risk
of competing morbidity and mortality. In response to PAR-18-893 ""Physical Activity and Weight Control
Interventions Among Cancer Survivors: Effects on Biomarkers of Prognosis and Survival,"" we will conduct a
randomized controlled trial of structured aerobic exercise training in 138 stage I-III colon cancer survivors.
Subjects will be recruited using the Louisiana Tumor Registry, a population-based registry funded by the NCI’s
Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program to reflect the socioeconomic diversity of the
region. Subjects will be randomized to stretching attention control or 225 min/wk of moderate-intensity aerobic
exercise (70% heart rate reserve) for 12-weeks. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that aerobic exercise decreases
whole-body intermuscular adipose tissue measured using whole-body magnetic resonance imaging. Aim 2 will
test the hypothesis that aerobic exercise decreases postprandial triglyceride concentration and increases free
fatty acid oxidation measured using an isotopically labeled liquid mixed meal containing [U-13C]palmitate. Aim
3 will test the hypothesis that aerobic exercise increases lower extremity skeletal muscle strength and physical
function using Biodex dynamometry and 10-step stair climb power. Myosteatosis is common and compromises
the health of colon cancer survivors. Identifying the health-promoting mechanisms of physical activity would
facilitate precision exercise prescriptions that are patient-centered and proven to have a high probability of
clinical benefit. The proposed aims will leverage a transdisciplinary team's synergies to offer comprehensive
and definitive insight into a novel biological mechanism of physical activity and cancer prognosis at the junction
of muscle physiology and adipocyte biology."

The long-term goal of this project is to define and identify circuit-specific cell types–cellular scale connectome–
that are selectively vulnerable to loss of cell bodies or axonal connections or change of transcriptomic
signatures of individual neurons during the progression of healthy aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Evidence suggests that knowledge on the change of cellular scale connectomes–cell type-specific circuits by
coupling single cell transcriptome with brain connectivity– is needed for holistic understanding of aging and AD
and provides an experimentally tractable basis to address longitudinal changes. These aging- and AD-
associated changes may include loss of cell types, connectivity or alterations in transcriptomic signatures. This
approach employed here is to test the hypothesis that there are aging- or AD state-specific neural and
molecular circuits that drive the progression of aging and AD. A large body of evidence demonstrates that AD is
a heterogeneous, multifactorial disease that selectively affects certain brain regions, e.g. the entorhinal cortex
(EC), while other areas, such as the cerebellum, remain unaffected. Recent studies on the staging of AD
neuropathology showed AD-related neuropathology begins in the locus coeruleus (LC) or the EC, followed by
the hippocampus (HC) and then the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The LC contains both adrenergic (NA) and non-
noradrenergic neurons and provides the major NA inputs throughout the entire brain. Neuropathological
staging has shown that tangles fist appear in the LC and NA activation has been shown to ameliorate AD
deficits. The EC provides key cortical inputs to the HC, which is essential in learning memory. The PFC
provides the top-down regulation on various higher order functions. But cell types-based input and/or output
networks that are selectively vulnerable at the single neurons level are not well understood. As aging is a major
risk factor for AD, it is important to understand whether there are distinct, similar or overlapping selectively
vulnerable circuit-specific cell types between aging and AD. This project is to combine retrograde labeling with
multiomic sn-RNAseq and sn-ATACseq to link transcriptomic and epigenomic properties of cell types to
neuronal projections and investigate circuit-specific changes associated with progression of aging and AD in
four brain regions, namely the LC, EC, HC and PFC, in both male and female control and AD mice. For AD
mice, the APPNLF mouse line–that carries knockin human mutations in the amyloid precursor protein gene and,
importantly, expresses physiological levels of Aβ, mimicking late onset AD–will be used. The data from this
project will provide novel insights on the types of neurons vulnerable to degeneration and/or alterations of
molecular/signaling signature networks in a spatial and temporal fashion and the correlation with
neuropathology and cognitive impairment. This approach is a major step toward establishing multiscale models
that will help to fill the gap between the effects of genetic variants (e.g., APP, AOPE or TREM2) on brain
topology with molecular networks in aging and AD."

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and the leading cause of global disease burden.
Associated with over 1,000 different symptom profiles, MDD is highly heterogeneous. The majority of MDD
symptom change occurs across hours. Consequently, there is a need to increasingly focus MDD research on
personalized assessment of these rapid symptom fluctuations. To date, personalized models of MDD have
shown promise, but relied solely on self-report measures. There is thus a critical need to develop personalized
models of MDD that incorporate objective signals. Passively collected information from smartphones and
wearable sensors can continuously and unobtrusively track behavioral and physiological signals related to core
disturbances associated with MDD, including psychomotor retardation, sleep disturbances, social contact,
behavioral activation, heart rate variability, and screen time. Preliminary data suggest that personalized
artificial intelligence (i.e., personally weighted deep learning models) are well suited for creating novel
personalized digital biomarkers of these passive indicators, and that these biomarkers can predict rapid
changes in MDD symptoms. This proposal will investigate the ability to develop personalized deep learning
models of rapid changes in MDD symptoms among a nationally representative sample of 120 treatment
seeking adults with MDD across 90 days using passively collected data from smartphones and wearable
sensors. This proposal aims to test the accuracy of personalized, subtyped, and cohort-based modeling
techniques and uncover personalized digital biomarkers of moment-to-moment changes in MDD symptoms.
The project proposes the following innovations: it will (1) conduct the first passive-sensing study of MDD in a
nationally-representative cohort; (2) utilize deep learning models to aid in the discovery of novel maintenance
factors of MDD symptom changes; and (3) use personalized multimodal assessments of MDD to address the
heterogeneity in MDD. In line with the aims of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), this project will
study MDD symptom changes across multiple units of analysis and integrate multiple systems. This study will
provide a critical step towards uncovering novel personalized maintenance patterns of MDD symptom changes
in daily life. Further, it will allow for scalable personalized treatments to be developed using technology to
deliver behavioral interventions in the moments immediately preceding rapid MDD symptom changes."

This Leica Stellaris 8 DIVE system is a multiphoton microscope for intravital imaging with video rate data
acquisition, deep tissue penetration, high sensitivity, and uses cutting edge spectral detection technology. This
system will replace a 12-year-old multiphoton microscope system that is no longer supported by the vendor
and currently off-line. More than 20 research faculty in the Center for Immunology at the University of
Minnesota depend on this instrument, and their research has been put on hold until the instrument can be
repaired (which seem increasingly less likely) or replaced. Among those faculty are the 6 NIH funded
investigators that constitute the major and minor users of this proposal. Multiphoton microscopy is used to
collect optical data to determine cellular movement and cellular interactions using fluorescent vital dyes and
genetically encoded fluorescent proteins. Using this technology, immunologists are investigating the cellular
and molecular mechanisms controlling cell motility, cellular interactions, and signals within intact tissues of
living animals. The Leica Stellaris 8 DIVE system will allow researchers to perform intravital multiphoton
imaging deep in tissue specimens to examine 4 different fluorescent signals or cell types simultaneously.
Research conducted by the investigators involved in this grant span multiple disciplines relating to public health
including autoimmunity, transplantation, cancer, immune activation, host/pathogen responses, vaccine design
and infectious diseases. The equipment obtained using these funds will allow our group to continue to perform
novel and cutting-edge biological imaging using multiphoton microscopy to pursue fundamental knowledge
regarding human health in these research areas. This technology will significantly enhance our ability to
achieve research aims to diagnose, treat, and protect individuals afflicted with a wide variety of conditions, and
will greatly aid in preventing and curing human diseases. Therefore, purchase of a new turn-key commercial
instrument will ensure our sustainability and access to this critical technology to achieve the aims of the NIH
funded investigators described in this proposal and provide cutting-edge technology for immunology
researchers at the University of Minnesota in the Center for Immunology."

We propose a large randomized clinical trial within the MFMU Network designed to evaluate the benefits and
safety of azithromycin-based prophylaxis (azithromycin plus standard cephalosporin) relative to standard
cephalosporin alone prior to surgical incision to prevent post-cesarean (CD) infection. In contrast to
cephalosporin, azithromycin is effective against additional pathogens encountered in polymicrobial post-CD
infections. We demonstrated adjunctive azithromycin, compared to standard prophylaxis, reduced maternal
infections by 50% with remarkable cost-savings in unscheduled CDs. The American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists (ACOG) now recommends routine use in unscheduled CDs. Our preliminary studies suggest
azithromycin may also lower infection risk in the 40-50% that are scheduled/pre-labor CDs, but there are safety
concerns regarding the adverse neonatal and long-term microbiome-mediated effects of perinatal exposure.
During the project period of 5 years, we will randomize up to 8000 women undergoing scheduled/pre-labor CD
to either 500mg of intravenous azithromycin or identical placebo initiated prior to surgery. Both groups will also
receive standard single-dose cefazolin prophylaxis (or alternative in the 5% allergic to cephalosporin). Women
will be followed for 6 weeks according to adapted Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
recommendations for ascertaining surgical site infections. The following specific aims will be addressed:
Primary Aim (Efficacy): Test in patients undergoing scheduled/prelabor CD if pre-incision adjunctive
azithromycin prophylaxis reduces the risk of post-CD infections compared to placebo. Primary Hypothesis:
Compared to standard prophylaxis (i.e. placebo + cefazolin alone), azithromycin (+ cefazolin) reduces the
incidence of post-CD infections (primary composite outcome of endometritis, wound and other severe infections).
Secondary Aim 1 (Safety): Assess the perinatal and maternal safety of pre-incision adjunctive azithromycin.
Hypothesis: Compared to standard prophylaxis (cefazolin alone), the use of azithromycin for scheduled CD does
not increase adverse perinatal outcomes including a perinatal composite of death, neonatal morbidities, cardiac
resuscitation, and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. We will also examine maternal and neonatal adverse events.
Secondary Aim 2 (Resource use): Test the hypothesis that compared to standard cefazolin prophylaxis alone,
adjunctive azithromycin reduces a secondary maternal composite outcome (postpartum readmission or ER or
unscheduled clinic visits), maternal hospital stay, neonatal ICU admission and neonatal hospital stay.
We will collect and store biological specimens including maternal and umbilical cord blood for future
mechanistic and biomarker studies. We also plan a separate microbiome sub-study proposal.
Completion of this trial, ranked #1/28 by MFMU, will likely change policy, extending the benefits of
azithromycin prophylaxis to scheduled CDs faster than the 20 years it took to for standard prophylaxis."

Lobectomy (resection of a portion of a cortex) or hemispherectomy (removal of a hemisphere) is an
increasingly common treatment for seizure management in individuals with pharmaco-resistant epilepsy.
Despite the removal of a considerable amount of visual cortex, these patients typically exhibit a remarkable
degree of recovery of visuo-cognitive function, particularly if the resection is performed in early childhood.
This restitution of function is all the more surprising given the distinct patterns of lateralization of the two
cerebral hemispheres in the normal brain. The proposed research undertakes a systematic examination of
the extent and nature of the recovery of visual abilities following cortical resection in children. Comparisons
to matched typical controls and to children with non-visual cortex resection are made both at the group-
level and for each individual, an important focus given the heterogeneity of this rare population. Cutting-
edge psychophysical and neuroimaging procedures, and novel analytic approaches, elucidate the nature and
changes in the cortical visual system pre- and post-surgery, and longitudinally thereafter, as well as the
mechanisms that give rise to recovery, potential modulatory effects of brain regions outside the visual system,
and possible biographical factors predicting recovery (e.g., age, side and size of resection).
 A first aim is to characterize the time-course of recovery in patients longitudinally and in detail, by
collecting neural and behavioral data pre-surgery and 6, 12, and 18 months post-surgery, characterizing the
changes in cortical selectivity, spatial topography, morphometric structure and behavioral competence in
the patients. A second aim examines with precision the integrity of the brain and behavior, assessing fine-
grained neural representations and a set of well-established computational properties exhibited by the normal
visual system. A final aim involves acquiring whole brain data driven in response to a naturalistic movie
viewing paradigm, to evaluate changes outside of the visual system that might influence and interact with the
observed recovery at the group and individual levels. Alternative theoretical accounts for recovery of function
are evaluated throughout.
 Little systematic research has targeted the patterns of visual deficits and their recovery following
surgical resection in children, and even less attention has been devoted to determining the underlying factors
that support (or potentially enhance) this plasticity. The study of an under-explored pediatric patient population,
and the use of detailed behavioral and neuroimaging data acquisition, breaks new ground in both the basic and
translational science of the visual system. Tracking these changes longitudinally with fine-grained methods
provides unprecedented insights into the nature of plasticity in the visual system, and may, ultimately, inform
the design of clinical interventions that facilitate functionally relevant cortical reorganization."

authors to uniquely identify which resources are used within a study. The RRID project was launched as a grass-
roots effort in 2014 to improve the identifiability of research resources in the biomedical literature. RRIDs depend
on the collaboration of journals with comprehensive registries and stock centers, which provide an authoritative
identifier for each resource type. The introduction of RRIDs has had a significant impact on our ability to identify
and track the use of research resources in the biomedical literature. Papers that use RRIDs have improved
identifiability of resources from <50% to >90%. RRIDs make it easier to track usage, assign credit, and aggregate
information about how resources perform in the literature. Towards that end, we have assembled a curated
knowledge base that provides information on RRID use in the literature. Because RRIDs are served from a
central database which is used broadly by scientists as they write their papers, the portal can also serve as a
central hub for disseminating critical information about how such reagents perform. For example, the RRID portal
provides warnings on contaminated cell lines provided by Cellosaurus. However, such information on other types
of resources is much more dispersed. Therefore, we built a related knowledge base, Resource Watch, that
enhances the information about RRIDs. The RRID project has been bootstrapped on top of existing NIH-funded
projects, but given its growth and importance to biomedicine, we seek to unify the current RRID project into a
self-supporting entity."

The long-term goal of the K01 candidate, Dr. Trang VoPham, is to become an independent investigator in the
epidemiology of environmental risk factors for liver disease using methods in geospatial science and health
disparities. Dr. VoPham is a highly skilled epidemiologist and geospatial scientist and requires additional training
in (1) liver disease epidemiology, (2) health disparities, and (3) electronic health record (EHR) analytics for her
to become a successful independent researcher in liver disease. She has worked closely with her Mentors
comprised of preeminent investigators in hepatology, disparities, epidemiology, and biostatistics: Dr. George
Ioannou (Primary Mentor) and Co-Mentors, Drs. Jason Mendoza, Joel Kaufman, and Kristin Berry, to develop a
comprehensive training and research program that builds on her research experience in liver cancer,
epidemiology, and geographic information systems (GIS). Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most
common cause of chronic liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of primary
liver cancer, are increasing in incidence worldwide. Recent evidence, including our preliminary data, show that
ambient exposure to particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5), a ubiquitous air pollutant, may
increase NAFLD and HCC risk. Further, there is evidence suggesting that PM2.5 may differentially impact NAFLD
and HCC risk in particular subgroups according to race/ethnicity, geography, and sex. Yet, to date, epidemiologic
studies have been cross-sectional, limited to small study areas with little exposure variability, and/or did not
adjust for potential confounders. EHRs are a valuable and underutilized resource for large-scale, prospective
epidemiologic studies of time-varying environmental exposures, including rich information on residential address
locations, clinical conditions, and demographics. Dr. VoPham proposes to fill these gaps in knowledge by
examining the associations between ambient PM2.5 exposure and NAFLD risk (Aim 1) and HCC risk (Aim 2) and
determining the role of PM2.5 on NAFLD and HCC incidence disparities by race/ethnicity, geography, and sex
(Aim 3). The applicant will leverage the geographically expansive, racially and ethnically diverse Veterans Affairs
(VA) patient population, conducting a state-of-the-science geospatial exposure assessment by linking VA patient
geocoded residential addresses from EHRs with a high-resolution, validated PM2.5 exposure model using GIS.
This interdisciplinary research will provide new insights into the potential role of PM2.5 as a novel, modifiable,
biologically plausible risk factor for NAFLD and HCC, and as a potential environmental factor driving incidence
disparities, providing translational insights to help identify individuals at high risk for liver disease. The world-
class interdisciplinary expertise of the Mentoring Team, along with the outstanding supportive research
environment at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, University of Washington, and VA Puget Sound
Health Care System, will ensure that Dr. VoPham achieves all of her career development and research goals
and will facilitate her transition to become a successful independent researcher in liver disease."
10842426,"This proposal describes the mission and strategic plans for of a Biomedical Technology Development and
Dissemination Center (RM1) entitled Center on Macromolecular Dynamics by NMR Spectroscopy
(CoMD/NMR). Located at the New York Structural Biology Center, CoMD/NMR has developed new
experimental and computational techniques in NMR spectroscopy, including both structure and dynamics
methods for both solution and solid state NMR. Here we focus mainly on spin relaxation methods, which have
already had great impact for characterizing protein and nucleic acid conformational dynamics during biological
processes including ligand recognition, allosterism, oligomerization, catalysis, and folding. The central
challenge addressed by CoMD/NMR is to break down the high activation barrier for new users to apply
advanced NMR spectroscopic and computational methods and thereby make sophisticated NMR approaches
available to a wide biological research community. To do so, CoMD/NMR addresses four primary obstacles.
(i) Because dynamics problems for biopolymers are frequently underdetermined, we develop incisive new
 experiments, pulse sequences and computational methods.
(ii) Because access to advanced NMR instruments can be a limitation for many users, we provide access
 to a range of enabling NMR instrumentation, including NMR spectrometers at multiple static magnetic
 fields, a range of modern probes, dynamic nuclear polarization, rapid-freeze-quench, high-pressure
 equipment, and field cycling relaxometry, all in a well maintained, staff supported, and multiuser
environment.
(iii) Because transfer of technology to biologists (and even to NMR spectroscopists) has been hindered by
 the complexity of the methods, and since time efficient use of the instruments is crucial, we develop
 robust efficient pipelines to facilitate experimental planning, data acquisition and analysis by non-
specialists.
(iv) Because biologists with research programs that would benefit from these methods are unaware of the
 potential, we engage in community outreach and education.
A unique strength of our program is the integration of forefront solid state NMR, solution NMR and
computational experts, and this proposal highlights synergy across these approaches. Additionally, being
situated within the NYSBC, we have excellent partnerships with X-ray diffraction, Cryo EM, and membrane
protein production technologies. Given the demanding nature of the three Technology Development Projects
(TDPs) proposed herein, we have identified a number of Technology Partnership Projects (TPPs), engaging
world leaders in aspects of NMR who have indicated their eagerness to partner with us. Technology
development proceeds most effectively when driven by exciting and challenging applications; accordingly,
CoMD/NMR will work closely with outstanding local and national investigators through Collaborative and
Service Projects (CSP), Driving Biomedical Projects (DBB) and Community Engagement (CE) activities,
including extensive training and dissemination programs. Through its various components, CoMD/NMR will
impact a diverse range of biological research with human health relatedness, including degenerative diseases,
metabolic disorders, and cancer."
10841109,"Abstract
Immunosuppression management follows standard protocol that is aimed at predetermined drug levels, with
minimal adjustments over the lifetime of the recipient. While successful in preventing rejection, the high burden
of suppression is associated with an increased incidence of drug-related side effects impacting the well-being of
the recipient. The absence of objective assays to evaluate immune activation poses a challenge in determining
the optimal dosage of immunosuppressive drugs and the ability to personalize therapy.
Our NIH Immune Tolerance Network trial (ITN030ST) demonstrated that many of the recipients can maintain
good allograft function with less immunosuppression, starting at a relatively early stage after transplantation.
However, tapering immunosuppression based on clinical observation of allograft function risks the development
of acute rejection, and the need for additional treatment to reverse rejection and rescue allograft function.
Mechanistic studies using ITN030ST serum samples retrieved prior to, during, and after tapering of
immunosuppression demonstrated that the trajectories of serum miRNAs are sensitive, specific, prognostic, and
diagnostic of acute rejection. Taken together we hypothesize that highly sensitive and specific miRNA profiles
can detect early molecular activation of immune response and allograft injury and will greatly improve safe
management and allow personalizing immunosuppression while reducing the risk of rejection.
The R34 application outlines a design for a prospective randomized study to assess whether serum miRNA
profiling can assist in safe tapering of immunosuppression when compared to clinically guided management.
The 3-phase approach to the design involve establishing trial procedures, followed by protocol design towards
implementation, and concludes with an outcome assessment plan. A subsequent clinical study will assess
whether miRNA profiles can be utilized as a predictor of rejection and aid in personalizing immunosuppression.
We also propose the design of mechanistic studies that will leverage clinical samples and data to improve
prediction of rejection. A novel technology developed by our investigators for methylation-based determination
the cell/tissue origins of cfDNA. Using this method, it will be possible to interrogate both liver pathology and the
activation of specific immune and inflammatory cell types, to identify early allograft injury and expose the
underlying causes of dysfunction and immune activation when tapering immunosuppression. In the long run, this
technology can get incorporated into protocols for personalized management of immunosuppression.
The proposed application takes us one step closer towards developing a clinical study aimed at implementing
biomarker-guided personalized immunosuppression in the transplantation setting. The study will also offer
valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying immune-mediated allograft injury associated with
the tapering of immunosuppression."

The overall goal of NIGMS-funded research in my lab is to understand the cellular and circuit mechanisms by
which neuropeptide signaling influences the neural circuits that control behavior. Neuropeptides are the most
common signaling molecule in the central nervous system and among the best markers for cell types in the
brain. These endogenous peptides transmit messages within the brain and across the body to control vital
physiologic processes like energy homeostasis, as well as motivational and emotional states including sleep,
arousal, pain, stress, and mood. Dysregulation of peptidergic signaling is implicated in medical conditions
ranging from obesity to psychiatric disorders. A vast scientific literature has investigated the role of
neuropeptides in physiology and behavior over decades, yet even for many well-studied circuits, their
functional significance is still an open question. Because they are not restricted spatially by the anatomical
wiring diagram nor temporally by rapid re-uptake or degradation, delineating the precise connectivity of
neuropeptide circuits in whole animals has proved challenging. My lab seeks to address this gap by developing
novel methods to monitor and selectively manipulate neuropeptide signaling in living animals, and to identify
the fundamental enzymes that regulate neuropeptide communication. We employ advanced imaging, genetic,
and biochemical approaches to investigate these questions using both worm and mouse model systems from
the subcellular level all the way to behavioral output. Our goal is to understand the biochemical logic of circuit
neuromodulation by neuropeptides with the same clarity that we understand fast neurotransmission at
synapses. This research will provide fundamental new insight into longstanding questions about the spatial and
temporal organization of neuropeptide signaling and lead to an understanding of how long-term changes are
affected in the nervous system that result in different behaviors. As neuropeptides and their receptors are
druggable targets implicated in a wide-range of diseases, we anticipate that mechanistic insight into their
signaling is likely to have broad clinical relevance for diseases characterized by behavioral dysfunction."

My laboratory studies genes and cell biological mechanisms that form, shape and
protect epithelial tubes, with a focus on very narrow unicellular tubes and apical
extracellular matrix (aECM). Both are topics relevant to human diseases involving
capillaries and other narrow tubes, but are challenging to study in most animal models
due to difficulties in imaging the relevant structures and molecules. The nematode C.
elegans allows us to circumvent these challenges by permitting imaging of live animals
at sub-cellular resolution, combined with powerful genetic approaches to identify relevant
genes and pathways. Our recent work showed that a unicellular tube is shaped by: (i)
intracellular membrane trafficking events that rely on a fusogen protein (AFF-1) better
known for its roles in cell-cell fusion; and (ii) a newly discovered type of aECM that
precedes the cuticle and contains proteins similar to those found in or near some
mammalian ECMs (e.g. those with leucine-rich repeat, plasminogen, zona pellucida,
mucin and/or nidogen domains). This aECM also relies on putative lipid transporters of
the lipocalin, scavenger receptor B (SCARB) and Patched-related families. Our research
program in the next five years will follow up on these advances to better understand the
specific trafficking events involved in building unicellular tubes and the structure and
function of the aECM. For example, we will further test the model that AFF-1 mediates
endocytic scission to allow membrane to be shuttled from basal to apical surfaces to
extend the tube lumen, and we will identify AFF-1 domains and partners involved in this
scission function. We will investigate how specific glycoproteins traffic to and assemble
within the aECM, how proper aECM lipid content is regulated by transporter families,
and how individual aECM components affect the shape and integrity of differently-sized
tubes in the organism."
10845697,"The overall objective of the Pilot Project Program is to further solidify and enrich the pilot project program’s
success achieved during Phase I and II of the COBRE by selecting talented mentees and highly experienced
mentors with matching expertise and by providing a competent and effective administrative structure to
guarantee good management, integration, and oversight of our pilot project program. This will be achieved by
our team of COBRE director, program coordinators, senior mentors, core leaders, other steering committee
members, and external advisory committee members. The success of their efforts will be assisted by our
COBRE program administrator. This team of investigators and administrators provides a carefully designed
framework to support and nurture our pilot project awardees and to ensure responsible conduct and scientific
rigor and reproducibility of their research, as they are coached in their development as independent
researchers. This supportive environment is created by providing the clear and rigorous selection process of
awardees and mentors, by ensuring the formative and summative evaluation of the progress of the selected
faculty, by instituting internal and external oversight of the pilot project program, and by the overt
communication of the expectations placed upon both the awardees and mentors. Notably, the Phase III pilot
project program will capitalize on the cutting-edge technologies provided by our scientific core. This shift in
emphasis is designed to enhance the impact of the research and contribute considerably to the sustainability of
our center. Thus, we will: (1) Provide administrative structure and technical resources to assure programmatic
growth and success of the pilot projects awardees that are selected through a rigorous plan specifically
developed for the Phase III COBRE. (2) Provide experienced mentors, mentoring and evaluation plans, and
programmatic and external oversight to ensure the success of pilot project awardees in obtaining independent
funding and in conducting scientifically rigorous and reproducible research. (3) Enhance local and national
career development opportunities to facilitate and guide pilot project awardees in their growth as independent
investigators, and at the same time enriching the research environment for all COBRE participants. These
measures will solidify our center by training dedicated scientists and by establishing long-term, mutually
beneficial interactions between researchers and the scientific core. These foci of contact will likely attract
additional investigators because of our efforts to foster internal and external alliances through continuing
mechanisms such as our seminar series, aging interest group meetings, and career development clubs that
are designed to attract COBRE and non-COBRE investigators, keep them engaged, and to encourage
collaborations."

 Recent developments in the field of immunotherapy clearly support the contribution of the immune system
in eradicating cancer. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are currently employed in the treatment of many
malignancies, and accumulating evidence suggests that many of the anticancer effects of HDAC inhibitors
involve the immune system.
 Previously, there was limited information on the role of HDAC11 in immunity and cancer. We discovered
that HDAC11 negatively regulates IL-10 production in antigen-presenting cells. We also found that HDAC11 is
highly expressed in T lymphocytes and neutrophils and, subsequently, revealed that HDAC11 disruption in T
cells is associated with an enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine profile and effector molecule production. T
cells lacking HDAC11 are less susceptible to regulatory T cell suppression in vitro, are refractory to tolerance
induction in vivo, and display enhanced anti-tumor responses in transplanted mantle cell lymphoma murine
models. Furthermore, HDAC11 is a multifaceted regulator of neutrophils. The absence of Hdac11 in
neutrophils significantly increases cellular production of proinflammatory cytokines and promotes cell migration
and phagocytic capacity.
 More recently, our group discovered an efficient novel activity for HDAC11, the removal of long-chain fatty
acyl groups from protein lysine residues. This novel activity is >10,000-fold more efficient than its deacetylase
activity. Using a syngeneic mouse-to-mouse model, we established ectopic tumors in Hdac11 wildtype and
knockout (KO) mice. The growth of the syngeneic lymphoma cells in the Hdac11 KO mice was markedly
inhibited, pointing toward a crucial role of HDAC11 in the tumor microenvironment. In this resubmission
application, the central hypothesis is that HDAC11 reprograms anti-cancer immunity via its defatty-acylation
activity and presents a potential novel drug target for cancer treatment.
 Our long-term goal is to develop a detailed molecular understanding of HDAC11's role in anti-tumor
immunity. Results from this work will: (1) provide a better understanding of the anti-tumor behavior of HDAC11;
(2) expand a functional understanding of protein lysine defatty-acylation in cancer; (3) develop better treatment
strategies for cancer through targeting the lysine defatty-acylation mechanism; and (4) produce selective
HDAC11 inhibitors, which will accelerate the development of new cancer treatment strategies."

Acute stroke treatments are time-sensitive. Tissue plasminogen activator is administered 3 to 4.5 hours from
the time of freedom from stroke symptoms. Imaging technologies such as computed tomography perfusion
might extend the treatment window. However, rapid hospital arrival remains critical to eligibility for stroke
treatment that can reduce subsequent disability. African Americans are more likely than Whites to delay in
hospital arrival after stroke symptom onset. Prior interventions have educated African American groups or the
entire community about stroke and the importance of calling 911. One-on-one stroke education interventions
are few in number. This project aims to educate African Americans individually when they present to the
emergency department (ED) of an urban safety net hospital. This approach allows us to access a hard-to
reach population at high risk for stroke to deliver a one-on-one stroke intervention that addresses specific
reasons African Americans delay in hospital arrival. By directly engaging with each participant, we expect to
improve attitudes towards calling 911, which promotes early hospital arrival, and eligibility for stroke treatments
which can ultimately reduce the burden of stroke on the population. Our specific aims are (i) to adapt a group-
based stroke education intervention to be delivered in a one-on-one format to patients presenting to the ED,
through qualitative interviews of patients and providers, (ii) to test whether the stroke intervention improves
behavioral intent to call 911, as measured by response to stroke and non-stroke video vignettes. This research
is in line with my career goal of developing, testing, and implementing behavioral interventions that will reduce
racial disparities in stroke incidence and treatment. To this end, my plan is to (i) obtain skills in the practical
application of community based participatory research, a research approach which involves partnering with the
community to develop behavioral interventions, (ii) build skills in randomized clinical trial design, as rigorous
efficacy testing of behavioral interventions involves randomization of participants, (iii) building expertise in
implementation science methods, so that I can translate the interventions that I develop into clinical practice.
The mentorship and resources at the University of Michigan will enable me to accomplish these career
development goals. At the University of Michigan, I am among a group of accomplished health equity stroke
researchers who have a track record of obtaining R-level NIH funding and are making significant contributions
to reducing the burden of stroke on society. The university facilitates interdepartmental research collaborations,
enabling me to be mentored by established researchers within and outside of the department of neurology.
Courses are taught by experts in their field, providing a rich learning environment. Additional resources include
organizations that offer seminars and workshops to facilitate the transition to an independent investigator. The
proposed project and career development plan will expedite my research independence. Future R01 studies
will involve scaling up and implementation of the proposed intervention."
10851017,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Excessive alcohol use is driven by various factors that are biological, psychological, and social in nature.
The degree of how these factors contribute to problematic drinking and then relapse after recovery vary widely
at the individual level. One common factor presented to all the users of alcohol is the set of cues closely linked
to alcohol consumption. Environmental cues that reliably precede alcohol availability and subsequent
consumption can gain the ability to elicit conditioned responses such as alcohol-seeking behavior and promote
problematic drinking.
 Current treatment for alcohol use disorder includes cue-exposure therapy, a behavioral procedure in
which alcohol cues are systematically presented in the absence of alcohol to promote a reduction or “extinction”
of cue-conditioned responses. Unfortunately, extinction is rarely permanent: extinguished cue-conditioned
alcohol-seeking responses are highly susceptible to relapse. We recently showed that a modification to standard
extinction procedure (i.e., cue-induced memory retrieval session prior to extinction) blocked the return of alcohol-
seeking behavior of rats with moderate level of alcohol consumption (Cofresi et al., 2017). This
“retrieval+extinction” approach has enormous potential in that a simple modification to cue-exposure therapy
protocols used in alcohol rehabilitation could significantly improve the odds of preventing relapse following
treatment.
 It is thus crucial to extend our initial finding to a rat model of alcohol dependence that better mimics the
human conditions of alcohol abuse. In fact, no study has systematically examined the nature and mechanism of
extinction, let alone retrieval+extinction, in a rat model of alcohol dependence. Therefore, we will determine
parameters that influence extinction and relapse of alcohol-seeking behavior in dependent rats, and further
examine whether retrieval+extinction is equally effective at preventing relapse in dependent rats as it was in non-
dependent rats. Then, we will probe the neural substrates underlying extinction of alcohol-seeking behavior in
dependent rats and test the hypothesis that retrieval+extinction engages neural mechanisms that are distinct
from standard extinction."
10851019,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Abdominal pain is a common symptom of digestive disease that is poorly addressed by existing therapies.
Probiotics are widely used to treat abdominal pain even though most studies that have examined their effects
have had disappointing results. A more effective strategy might be to stimulate specific pathways of microbes
already present in the gut that benefit the host. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine if a
microbial pathway that reactivates steroids in the gut lumen normally regulates the activity of sensory neurons
that mediate visceral sensation, and whether this pathway can be manipulated to influence abdominal pain.
Abdominal pain is mediated by visceral afferents, primary sensory neurons located outside the gut that
communicate information from the gut to the central nervous system. Prior studies suggest that commensal
microbiota normally limit visceral afferent sensitivity. Depletion of commensal microbes causes exaggerated
responses to colorectal distention, evidence that visceral afferents become hypersensitive to non-noxious
stimuli in the absence of microbes. The full extent of microbial effects on visceral pain and the signals that
mediate them, however, are largely unclear. Androgens, steroid hormones that circulate at higher levels in
males than females, are compelling candidates. Androgens are anti-nociceptive in somatic pain and emerging
evidence suggests they have similar effects in visceral pain. In irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a disorder
defined by chronic abdominal pain, we found that low androgen levels were associated with both diagnosis and
symptom severity in males and females. Furthermore, androgen homeostasis has clear links to gut microbiota.
Like other steroids, androgens are inactivated by glucuronidation in the liver and excreted into bile. In the gut
lumen, these inactive forms become substrates for microbial β-glucuronidase enzymes (GUS) that remove the
glucuronide moieties, regenerating a large pool of active androgens. Thus, androgen reactivation could be a
key mechanism by which commensal microbes limit visceral hypersensitivity, linking previous observations.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that androgens reactivated by microbial GUS signal directly to host
visceral afferent neurons to limit peripheral sensitization and pain. First, we will establish the independent
effects of commensal microbes, microbial GUS activity, and androgen signaling to visceral afferent neurons on
abdominal pain. Then, we will test for mechanistic links between each component. Incorporating genetic and
gnotobiotic mouse models as well novel inhibitors of microbial GUS enzymes developed by the co-I, a leader in
GUS chemistry, this innovative project moves the PI's research program into new directions of visceral pain
and host-microbe interactions. The impact of this work will be to advance the understanding of visceral
sensation and generate key evidence for new rational therapeutic targets in abdominal pain."

has already assisted six PJls, ten Pilot Project Investigators, and other NIH-funded investigators to successfully 
pursue their research objectives resulting in high impact peer-reviewed publications and successful NIH funding. 
The establishment of this core has facilitated productive collaboration among investigators and members of the 
biomedical research community in Louisiana. This core has also educated underrepresented minority (URM) 
undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, summer scholars (DVM Students) in the 
application of and the current advances in pulmonary immunology through lectures, laboratory classes, and 
workshops. During Phase II, the PIPC will continue to meet two specific aims: Aim 1. To provide the COBRE 
and other biomedical investigators with resources on comprehensive immunopathological assessments for mice, 
including instrumentation, technical support and consultation. Aim 2. To educate faculty, staff, postdoctoral 
fellows, and graduate students regarding the application and the current advances in immunopathological 
assessments for mice. To ensure the success of the COBRE in Lung Biology and Disease COBRE PJIs, the 
continued operation of the PIPC is essential to meet the current and future needs of LSU and other institutions 
because this is the only PIPC in the state of Louisiana. In Phase II, the PIPC will provide required capabilities to 
measure the immunopathological outcomes infectious and non-infectious inflammation in mice, will promote 
immunological, pathological endpoints of project-specific parameters, and will streamline tasks to maximize 
efficiency, productivity, benefits, and economy."
10851960,"Project Summary / Abstract
In this proposal we aim to define the molecular mechanisms of division and differentiation in a phylum that
consists entirely of bacterial species that live in osmotically stable, intracellular environments. During
adaptation to intracellular life, microbes often exhibit a significant reduction in their genome size, resulting in
the loss of metabolic and structural elements that are not required for life within a host cell. The bacterial cell
wall, composed of peptidoglycan, protects most bacterial species from osmotic stress and is essential for cell
division. Peptidoglycan also determines a bacterial cell’s shape, and by directing its synthesis and degradation
microbes can effectively control cell size and differentiation between developmental forms. Nascent
peptidoglycan biosynthesis is spatially and temporally restricted within bacterial cells via two known molecular
complexes: the MreB complex, which is primarily associated with bacterial cell wall synthesis, and the FtsZ
complex, which is associated with septal peptidoglycan synthesis required during cell division. Members of the
Chlamydiae do not encode FtsZ and have long been thought to completely lack peptidoglycan. We recently
discovered that several members of the Chlamydiaceae synthesize peptidoglycan but do not use it to form a
canonical cell wall. Instead, these microbes utilize only septal peptidoglycan in their replicative forms, which is
maintained, paradoxically, by an MreB complex. Here we propose a series of studies to investigate how
members of the Chlamydiaceae temporally and spatially restrict peptidoglycan synthesis throughout the
division process, efficiently controlling cell size, division, and the transition between developmental forms.
Over the next five years we plan to increase our understanding of these fundamental processes by focusing on
three major areas of investigation: 1) Identifying the mechanisms that direct and influence peptidoglycan
synthesis and degradation in the absence of FtsZ, 2) characterizing polar localizing features present in
Chlamydia and assessing their role in orienting peptidoglycan and the cell division complex, and 3)
establishing the critical factors that influence bacterial cell size in an osmotically stable environment during the
course of normal development and in response to cell stress. Genetically reduced microbes are attractive
models for identifying the fundamental components of essential physiological processes. These planned
studies will elucidate not only how genetically reduced microbes regulate cell size and divide in osmotically
stable environments, but also illuminate the inherent versatility of the broadly conserved molecular complexes
underlying these process."
10851976,"Research from the last decade has identified cellular senescence and alteration of gut microbial composition as
primary physiological processes that facilitate aging and a wide range of age-related diseases. Because of their
profound impact on health and disease, they represent two promising ideas in developing innovative strategy to
improve health and increase longevity. However, the interplay of the microbiome and cellular senescence in age-
related metabolic dysfunction is largely unknown. The major goal of this proposed study is to elucidate the causal
connection of cellular senescence and the microbiome in older mice under metabolic stress. We showed a high
fat diet (HFD) induced senescent cell loads, increased the abundance of pro-inflammatory gut bacteria, and
aggravated metabolic function. In contrast, caloric restriction (CR) decreased gene expression associated with
senescence in humans and mice. An intermittent fasting (IF) diet that mimics CR improved metabolic function,
and increased the abundance of Akkermansia known to have strong anti-inflammation and anti-aging property.
Using our novel p21-Cre mouse model, we found that depletion of senescent cells expressing high levels of p21
(p21high) profoundly increased the relative abundance of Akkermansia, and improved metabolic dysfunction in
male mice on a HFD. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that cellular senescence modulates the microbiome
composition and function. This will be achieved by directly transplanting or genetic clearance of senescent cells
in older male and female mice, and determine their impact on the gut microbiome and microbial metabolites (Aim
1a). The microbiome changes will be determined at population level and functional level as these have not been
well-defined previously in aging or age-related diseases. Using our novel p21-Cre mouse model, we will further
assess if senescence induced alteration of the microbiome is a novel mechanism by which senescent cells
influence metabolic function. We will also test the hypothesis that SASP mediates the senescence-induced
microbiome changes by inactivating NF-κB in p21high senescent cells (Aim 1b). In Aim 2, we will test the
hypothesis that the gut microbiome modulates senescence development. We will examine development of
senescence in mice receiving fecal microbiota derived from a HFD (Aim 2a). We will determine the potential
suppression of senescent cells by fecal microbiota transplantation of the microbiota derived from IF or mono-
colonization of Akkermansia (Aim 2b). Establishment of reciprocal modulation of the microbiome and cellular
senescence will deepen our fundamental understanding of the pathophysiology of aging and age-related

to improve health and increase longevity."
11092648,"Research from the last decade has identified cellular senescence and alteration of gut microbial composition as
primary physiological processes that facilitate aging and a wide range of age-related diseases. Because of their
profound impact on health and disease, they represent two promising ideas in developing innovative strategy to
improve health and increase longevity. However, the interplay of the microbiome and cellular senescence in age-
related metabolic dysfunction is largely unknown. The major goal of this proposed study is to elucidate the causal
connection of cellular senescence and the microbiome in older mice under metabolic stress. We showed a high
fat diet (HFD) induced senescent cell loads, increased the abundance of pro-inflammatory gut bacteria, and
aggravated metabolic function. In contrast, caloric restriction (CR) decreased gene expression associated with
senescence in humans and mice. An intermittent fasting (IF) diet that mimics CR improved metabolic function,
and increased the abundance of Akkermansia known to have strong anti-inflammation and anti-aging property.
Using our novel p21-Cre mouse model, we found that depletion of senescent cells expressing high levels of p21
(p21high) profoundly increased the relative abundance of Akkermansia, and improved metabolic dysfunction in
male mice on a HFD. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that cellular senescence modulates the microbiome
composition and function. This will be achieved by directly transplanting or genetic clearance of senescent cells
in older male and female mice, and determine their impact on the gut microbiome and microbial metabolites (Aim
1a). The microbiome changes will be determined at population level and functional level as these have not been
well-defined previously in aging or age-related diseases. Using our novel p21-Cre mouse model, we will further
assess if senescence induced alteration of the microbiome is a novel mechanism by which senescent cells
influence metabolic function. We will also test the hypothesis that SASP mediates the senescence-induced
microbiome changes by inactivating NF-κB in p21high senescent cells (Aim 1b). In Aim 2, we will test the
hypothesis that the gut microbiome modulates senescence development. We will examine development of
senescence in mice receiving fecal microbiota derived from a HFD (Aim 2a). We will determine the potential
suppression of senescent cells by fecal microbiota transplantation of the microbiota derived from IF or mono-
colonization of Akkermansia (Aim 2b). Establishment of reciprocal modulation of the microbiome and cellular
senescence will deepen our fundamental understanding of the pathophysiology of aging and age-related
metabolic diseases, and pave the way to develop robust interventions targeting senescence, microbiome or both
to improve health and increase longevity."
10902060,"The overarching goal of the Northwestern University (NU) CCCR is to promote cutting-edge clinical research
aimed at prevention or control of rheumatic and musculoskeletal conditions and poor outcomes associated with
them. While we will provide broad support, we will particularly seek to drive this theme: prevention strategy and
intervention development through lifestyle, behavioral, medical, and rehabilitative solutions, built on a
foundation of person-centered assessment in daily life and community engagement. Our overall aims are to:
1) accelerate and enhance funded research, by increasing stakeholder engagement, efficiency, rigor,
collaboration, cost-effectiveness, productivity, and impact; 2) organize and catalyze all relevant research at
NU, applying a health equity lens, adding value, and moving it forward in a way that would otherwise not be
feasible; 3) promote new research within our mission areas, by expanding the Research Community working in
these areas and by expanding research fields within the mission. We will organize our resources into Cores but
function as an integrated unit. Methodologic Core aims are: 1) provide expertise in study design, methodology,
outcomes, and analysis planning; work with the Community Advisory Board and Resource Core to assist
design that incorporates personal and community perspectives; integrate, as needed, input on adaptive and
pragmatic study design, epidemiology, behavioral science, nutritional science, economic evaluation, policy
analysis, genomics, bioinformatics, and clinical informatics; 2) facilitate use of existing databases and
registries; 3) promote safe and responsible data management; 4) assist users in statistical analyses that
maximize the potential of study data; and 5) enhance the training environment. Resource Core, Community
Engaged Assessment and Intervention Science and Technology in Daily Life, aims are: 1) create and sustain
interaction between stakeholders and research teams through project stages: a) build pathways for
community?academic exchange to increase research value for improving health and equity by refining ideas
and planning in partnership; b) build capacity for community-engaged research; 2) help teams design research
that integrates personal and community perspectives; refine research questions, study design, assessment
plan, intervention comparators and intervention procedures, and assist with budget planning, with the
Methodologic Core; get stakeholder input on variables and outcomes and collaboratively develop assessment
plans that can include: social determinants of health; accelerometry to assess physical activity, sedentary
behavior, and sleep; mobile and sensor-based applications that identify behavioral markers; and wearable
biosensors to predict physiological and psychological states; 3) help teams operationalize their research and
create dissemination plans. Because our CCCR is centered on the goal to improve how persons feel and
function in daily life, focuses on community and personal experience, and builds upon the wearable and
portable technology revolution, we are positioned to have substantial impact on work within and beyond NU."

Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic and intractable disease with a 5-year survival rate comparable to pancreatic or
lung cancers. Deterioration of respiratory function in pulmonary fibrosis is caused by progressive replacement
of normal tissue for gas exchange to dense fibrotic scar with fibrillar collagens. Pathologic fibroblasts
accumulate at the sites of fibrogenesis and work as effector cells for excessive collagen deposition.
Development of therapeutic strategies for targeting pathologic fibroblasts is hindered by the lack of
understanding to cellular lineage and molecular detail of pathologic fibroblasts. In our previous study, we
performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of normal and fibrotic lungs of mouse and human with a specialized
protocol to identify all collagen-producing cells. We identified several fibroblast subsets that localize in different
compartments of the lung. One of the fibroblast subsets emerge in fibrotic lungs of both mouse and human and
show the highest levels of collagen gene expression and enhanced migratory capacity. These fibroblasts are
characterized by specific expression of Cthrc1 (collagen triple helix repeat containing 1) and localized within
fibroblastic foci of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, suggesting their pathologic role in pulmonary fibrosis. We
recently generated and validated a novel mouse strain, Cthrc1-CreER, which allows us to specifically
manipulate the pathologic fibroblast population in pulmonary fibrosis. The goal of this K99/R00 proposal is to
elucidate the role and transcriptional regulations of pathologic fibroblasts in pulmonary fibrosis by using our
innovative murine tools. Aim 1 (K99 phase) will reveal the role and fate of pathologic fibroblasts by ablating
Cthrc1+ cells or lineage-tracing Cthrc1-CreER-labeled cells over the course of bleomycin-induced pulmonary
fibrosis. Aim 2 (K99 phase) will reveal the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of pathologic fibroblasts by
performing RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq of purified Cthrc1-CreER-labeled cells at multiple time points of
pulmonary fibrosis to seek master regulators for activation and deactivation. We will also seek the
transcriptional regulations of CTHRC1+ cells in human pulmonary fibrosis. Aim 3 (R00 phase) will demonstrate
the role of genes regulating pathologic fibroblasts by using intratracheal adoptive transfer of fibroblasts with
lentiviral gene modifications and by conditionally knocking out candidate genes in fibroblasts in pulmonary
fibrosis. These studies using the murine genetic tool highly specific for pathologic fibroblasts will shed light on
cellular function and transcriptional regulations of pathologic fibroblasts in pulmonary fibrosis. This proposal is
also designed to provide the candidate with training opportunity to obtain skill sets for murine genetic approach
in search of therapeutic targets and functional genomics approach integrating RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-
seq. The success of this project will enable the candidate to establish his expertise in the field of pulmonary
fibrosis and lead to the candidate’s transition to scientific independence over the course of award period."

Astrocytes are the most abundant type of glial cell in the brain, playing vital roles in all facets of brain physiology.
Given their central role in brain function, astrocytes have been implicated in a variety of psychiatric disorders
including autism, anxiety, schizophrenia, depression, and suicide. Despite the progress in understanding the
abnormalities in brain circuits and related molecular pathways, how astrocytes contribute to circuit dysfunction
associated with psychiatric disorders remains nascent. Recent studies have shown that astrocytes play an
essential role in amygdala function and associated behavioral outputs, which led us to further examine how
amygdala astrocytes contribute to human depression and associated suicide. Towards this, we performed
immunostaining from suicide decedents (N=20) and age-matched control, finding that the canonical astrocyte
marker GFAP and a key astrocyte transcription factor NFIA are both drastically increased in the amygdala of
suicide decedents. Recently, we reported that NFIA plays an essential role in the physiological activities of
astrocytes, neuronal circuit activity, and brain function in the adult hippocampus. This evidence led us to
hypothesize that astrocytic NFIA contributes to depression and associated suicide by regulating amygdala circuit
function. To determine whether astrocytic NFIA affects amygdala circuit function and associated depressive
behaviors, we utilized NFIA gain-of-function (GOF) and loss-of-function (LOF) mouse models. Preliminary
studies revealed that NFIA GOF induced depressive/anxiety behaviors, while NFIA LOF suppressed these
behaviors. In both cases, direct physiological analysis of amygdala circuit activity revealed significant and
complementary alterations.
 Therefore, based on the strength of these preliminary data, we propose the following specific aims. In
specific aim 1, we will determine the role of astrocytic NFIA in amygdala circuit activity and function using NFIA
GOF and LOF mice models. In specific aim 2, we will decipher how astrocytic NFIA regulates amygdala circuits
through GABA/MAOB. In this study, we will identify the target gene of NFIA using RNA-sequencing and
manipulate the target gene with pharmacological/genetic tools. In specific aim 3, we will delineate astrocytic
NFIA transcriptional networks in the amygdala. In this study, we will dissect the amygdala-specific NFIA
transcriptional networks and confirm this in human samples."

The goal of the T32 Investigational Cancer Therapeutics Training Program (ICTTP) at Memorial Sloan-
Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) is to provide highly select physician trainees in hematology and medical
oncology with the research training necessary for successful careers in the translation of cancer biology
discoveries into novel molecular, immune, or cell-based therapeutics, and those experimental treatments into
clinical trials that have the potential to change standards of care. The T32 ICTTP program accomplishes this
goal by combining a comprehensive mentored training program, an extensive didactic curriculum in clinical and
translational research methodologies, and experiential programs supporting development of the critical career
skills (e.g. collaboration, research management, grant writing) necessary for academic success. Each year, we
select 4 highly committed postdoctoral trainees from the pool of outstanding physicians at MSK who have
completed at least 3–4 years of both internal medicine and oncology/hematology clinical training. T32 trainees
are then supported for 2 consecutive years so that ≥ 80% of their time and effort is dedicated to research
training. Based on individual research interests and career goals, ICTTP trainees develop either a laboratory-
based or a prospective clinical research program with guidance from their mentors, who are established,
independently funded investigators. These programs involve extensive collaborative scientific interactions,
including additional clinical scientist mentorship for laboratory-based trainees and laboratory scientist
mentorship for clinical research trainees. The T32 ICTTP supplements mentored research training with a
curriculum of symposia, workshops, in-person didactic programs, and online courses that prepares trainees to
conduct successful, independently supported research at the faculty level. We continue to enhance the
program by revising and adding new educational programs in clinical research methodology, research ethics,
national and international clinical trial requirements and conduct, as well as hands-on writing workshops for
grants and protocols. Participating faculty mentors are continually reviewed and selected based on strict
criteria for research productivity, independent funding, and quality of mentoring. T32 ICTTP mentors have
research programs on cancer genetics, genomics, epigenetics, signal transduction, and metabolism; tumor
immunology and immunotherapy; drug and cellular therapeutic development; and tumor evolution, using
systems and computational approaches. Projects conducted by T32 ICTTP trainees in the proposed funding
period continue similar themes in cancer therapeutics research. All T32 ICTTP graduates from the last funding
cycle are continuing in faculty or pharmaceutical industry positions in cancer research, with the majority having
secured independent research funding. This success continues the ICTTP's 40-year track record of training
leaders in cancer therapeutic development and translational research."
10848777,"Abstract
OA pain is heterogeneous with distinct mechanisms across pain phenotypes that are poorly understood and
that likely underlie the variability in therapeutic efficacy across OA pain patients. Many OA patients report mid-
stage OA pain that occurs during joint use and dissipates during rest. Others develop advanced OA pain
characterized by persistent joint pain that does not dissipate during rest and that is resistant to current
treatments. Females have a higher incidence of OA pain and report more severe pain compared to males. This
grant application uses an innovative mouse model of mid- and advanced OA pain that allows analysis of
mechanisms underlying the transition between mid-stage and advanced OA pain. Female mice develop
advanced OA pain with less joint damage compared to males allowing analysis of sex differences that underlie
enhanced susceptibility for females to develop advanced OA pain compared to males. The proposed studies
will investigate pathological changes in innervation of the joint and adjacent muscle by comparing controls to
mid-stage and advanced OA pain. The specific aims will explore the hypothesis that mice with advanced OA
have sensory nerve sprouting into joint tissues and adjacent muscle as well as sensory nerve damage and that
females develop nerve sprouting and nerve injury in the context of less joint tissue damage compared to
males. Aim 1 will determine pathological sprouting of sensory nerves in the knee joint and surrounding muscle
of male and female mice with mid-stage and advanced OA pain. This aim will examine whether males and
females with advanced OA develop pathological sprouting of small diameter CGRP positive fibers and NF-200
positive myelinated fibers into joint tissues and adjacent muscle, and whether females with advanced OA pain
show pathological sprouting in the context of less joint tissue damage. Aim 2 will determine potential
differences in axonal nerve injury through induction of ATF3 in sensory neuron cell bodies of male and female
mice with mid-stage and advanced OA pain. Retrograde labeling from the knee joint or tibialis anterior muscle
will be used to examine whether there are differences in ATF3 within sensory neurons innervating the joint
compared to the adjacent muscle. Co-labeling of ATF3 with CGRP and NF200 will be used to analyze whether
there are differences in nerve injury across the different populations of sensory fibers. These techniques will
elucidate whether nerve injury occurs specifically in the context of advanced OA pain and whether it is
observed in females with less joint pathology compared to males. Improved understanding of the
pathophysiological changes within the joint that differ between mid-stage and advanced OA pain is a critical
step in improving pain management across this heterogeneous pain condition. Direct analysis of sexual
dimorphism in these changes will provide insights into potential increase susceptibility for females to develop
neuropathic pain and require different therapeutic treatment strategies compared to males."
